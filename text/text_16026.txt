BACKGROUND
the phylum apicomplexa contains several protozoan pathogens that cause severe disease in mammals, including humans. members such as plasmodium falciparum, and p. vivax, which cause severe human malaria, and theileria parva and t. annulata, which are responsible for economic losses in cattle in africa, result in profound medical, social, and economic effects  <cit> . others such as toxoplasma gondii, cryptosporidium parvum and c. hominis are primarily health threats in hiv+/aids and immunosuppressed populations  <cit> .

apicomplexans are primarily obligate intracellular parasites that rely on actin-based motility for cell invasion  <cit> . invasion occurs by active parasite motility that is coupled to timed secretion of proteins from specialized apical secretory organelles, which are a hallmark feature of this phylum  <cit> . the apical secretory organelles  release their contents in a highly regulated fashion upon host cell interactions  <cit> . microneme proteins provide adhesion to the host cells and supply the traction needed for invasion. rhoptry and dense granule proteins function in the establishment and maintenance of a protective, intracellular niche called the parasitophorous vacuole . understanding how motility and invasion are regulated is crucial to elucidating the pathobiology of these organisms, yet we know relatively little about how these functions are controlled at the cellular level.

apicomplexans are characterized by a unique cytoskeleton that is distinct from that of other eukaryotes  <cit> . at their apical end is a specialized microtubule-organizing center called the polar ring complex, which coordinates a series of singlet microtubules called the subpellicular microtubules  <cit> . the remarkable stability of these microtubules provides a defined shape and polarity to the cells that is necessary for motility and invasion  <cit> . the subpellicular microtubules encompass the apical secretory organelles and may play a role in trafficking to the apical end of the cell. apicomplexans also regulate their actin cytoskeleton differently, maintaining a large pool of soluble actin, both globular and in short, unstable filaments  <cit> . during motility, actin filaments must rapidly assemble to support gliding and then turnover rapidly to prevent unwanted movement. actin regulation is thus crucial to the control of motility. in other eukaryotes, a large family of actin-related proteins helps control many cytoskeletal functions including vesicle transport and actin-based motility.

actin-related proteins  are conserved across all eukaryotes and some prokaryotes. although all members share a common actin-fold and an overall sequence similarity to actin  <cit> , individual arps carry out a variety of biochemical and structural roles in the cell  <cit> . these include roles in cell division  <cit> , translocation of cargo along microtubules via dynein  <cit> , actin polymerization  <cit> , and transcriptional regulation via chromatin/ heterochromatin remodeling  <cit> . currently, more than  <dig> classes of arps have been reported from a broad range of eukaryotes including plants, animals, fungi, and protozoans . in each case, the arp groups link the separate kingdoms both by protein similarity and common biochemical functions. despite their apparent conservation among the majority of eukaryotes, no arps have been previously described in the apicomplexa.

complete genome sequences have recently been provided for a variety of apicomplexan parasites. a cursory examination of these genomes reveals multiple actins and actin related proteins; however, these have been inconsistently identified and annotated. the complex biology of these parasites led us to examine actin-related proteins in this phylum relative to other eukaryotes using a combination of phylogenetic and reciprocal blast analyses. our findings reveal a complexity of actin-related proteins not previously appreciated and define both conserved and unique members of this protein family within the apicomplexa.

RESULTS
phylogenetic comparisons of actin-like proteins in apicomplexans
we searched the recently completed genomes of toxoplasma gondii, plasmodium spp., cryptosporidium spp., and theileria spp. for actin-related proteins using conventional actins and conserved arp proteins from organisms spanning several phyla including mammals, plants, flies, worms, yeast, and protozoa . blast analysis identified over  <dig> candidate actin-related proteins in total among the apicomplexan genomes examined in this study . reciprocal blastp searches using each of these apicomplexan actin-like proteins against the ncbi cdd database revealed that the majority of them contain a conserved actin domain  . however, at present individual actin-related protein groups have not been defined by distinct domains or motifs common to members of only one group. consequently, we sought to establish relationships between the apicomplexan actin-like proteins and conventional arps using sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses. candidate actin-related proteins were aligned with a broader spectrum of arps from a variety of eukaryotic taxa and bacterial actin-like proteins using clustalx  <cit> . the relative divergence of actin-like proteins was determined by neighbor-joining distance analysis using the phylogenetic analysis program paup* <dig> b  <cit> . the resulting bootstrapped phylogram is shown in fig.  <dig>  parsimony analysis revealed a similar branching pattern for the major arp groups, but was less able to resolve deep branching groups , likely due to the divergence of these sequences . we have focused primarily on the relationships supported by distance analysis, since this methodology is more appropriate for highly divergent sequences.

our analysis reveals that the apicomplexans all encode a single conventional actin , and the remaining proteins form a total of  <dig> distinct actin-related protein groups . three of these groups were shown to belong to well-characterized arps including arp <dig>  arp <dig>  and arp <dig> . in contrast, we discovered that several other apicomplexan actin-like proteins  were unique to this phylum, as they did not group with any of the conventional arps ; therefore, we have used the designation actin-like protein  to differentiate the apicomplexan-specific protein groups. a comparison of actin-like proteins within the apicomplexa is summarized in table  <dig>  the remaining alps were specific to a subset of apicomplexans such as toxoplasma , cryptosporidium  and plasmodium . several of these groups also contain paralogues, for example alp5a and alp5b in plasmodium . while some alps appear as deep branches  they were grouped and hence named in part based on blast results  and phylogenetic analysis of apicomplexan alps compared in the absence of other organisms . our findings suggest that some actin-like proteins play roles that are conserved across all eukaryotes while other members of this group have diverged to fulfill specific roles within the apicomplexa.

the two key features most prominent about the apicomplexan actin-like proteins are their strong conservation of the arp <dig> protein  and their remarkable lack of both arp <dig> and arp <dig> homologues  . the presence of a highly conserved arp <dig> and the absence of arp <dig> and arp <dig> orthologues have important biochemical implications for these parasites regarding vesicular trafficking and actin regulation, respectively. arp <dig> is an essential component of the dynactin complex involved in vesicular trafficking  <cit>  while arp2/ <dig> forms a multi-subunit complex that is the primary means of regulating actin polymerization in eukaryotic cells  <cit> . for these reasons, we conducted a more comprehensive study of the protein components that constitute these complexes.

the dynactin complex
dynactin is a microtubule-associated complex that is critical for tethering cellular cargo to the cytoplasmic motor protein dynein  <cit> . cytoplasmic dynein consists of heavy, light, intermediate, and intermediate light chains in addition to several regulatory subunits  <cit> . we searched the p. falciparum and c. parvum genomes to identify components of this complex using text word searches. convincing orthologues for all of the subunits were found in both parasites as shown by reciprocal blastp and the presence of conserved pfam domains . these hits were then used to identify orthologues in other apicomplexan genomes by blastp as verified by both significant blast e-values and the presence of conserved pfam domains . somewhat surprisingly, a complete complex was not readily identified in theileria, with the exception of subunits for heavy and light chains .

based on the presence of a conserved dynein complex in a majority of apicomplexans, we thought it reasonable to search for evidence of a dynactin complex. the dynactin complex consists of several protein subunits that are grouped into two domains: the arp <dig> rod and a flexible arm region. the protein subunits of the arp <dig> rod are more highly conserved between eukaryotes than the remaining dynactin subunits  <cit> ; therefore, we focused our efforts on defining homologues to these proteins in the apicomplexans. the subunits comprising the arp <dig> rod include arp <dig>  arp <dig>  capping protein , p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  and actin .

we used database searches to identify the dynactin subunits within apicomplexans. sequences from mammals, flies, worms, and protozoa were compared against the nbci nr database and the respective genomic databases of toxoplasma, plasmodium, and cryptosporidium  . arp <dig> was readily identified in plasmodium, cryptosporidium, and toxoplasma, although it is apparently absent in theileria . highly conserved orthologues of the p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> subunits were found in toxoplasma, plasmodium, and cryptosporidium as shown by both significant blastp e-values and the presence of conserved pfam domains .

the arp <dig> rod contains a short filament of arp <dig> subunits  <cit>  that is capped at both ends. the  or barbed end is terminated by capping protein  <cit>  and the  or pointed end by the actin-related protein arp <dig>  <cit> . toxoplasma and plasmodium both contain β subunits of capping protein, and the α subunit in plasmodium showed a significant blastp e-value and conserved pfam motif . the α subunit reported for toxoplasma is highly divergent  and does not have significant matches, although blastp searches turn up a number of α subunit orthologues . additionally only the β subunit was identified in cryptosporidium . capping protein always exists as an α/β dimer  <cit>  and it is possible the α subunit is divergent in toxoplasma and cryptosporidium and hence difficult to recognize at present. our phylogenetic analysis of the arps did not show strong affinities between any of the alp proteins and the arp <dig> group . however, we have included tgalp <dig>  pfalp <dig>  and cpalp <dig> as possible arp <dig> orthologues based on their sequence similarity to the arp <dig> proteins in blastp searches .

dynamitin is a component of the flexible arm region of the dynactin complex  <cit> . we identified proteins with recognizable dynamitin domains in toxoplasma and plasmodium, but not cryptosporidium . the remaining subunits of the dynactin complex were not detected by blast or protein domain searches in these organisms. however since these other subunits are less well conserved, failure to detect them by blast is not surprising.

the identification of apicomplexan orthologues to all the subunits of the arp <dig> rod, and the presence of dynamitin in toxoplasma and plasmodium, provides strongly supportive evidence that a functional complex exists in these parasites. theileria appears to be an exception to this pattern as neither arp <dig> or the other subunits were recognized. the conserved complex in parasites likely carries out duties analogous to the dynactin in other eukaryotes. one possible role for this complex would be the directed delivery of secretory protein vesicles as has been described in other systems  <cit> . secretory protein trafficking occurs via an er-golgi mediated pathway  <cit>  and dynactin could provide the transportation by which cargo vesicles reach their specialized secretory organelles at the apical pole. apical secretion is an important component of cellular invasion and maintenance of this polarization is thus vital to the survival of the parasite.

the arp2/ <dig> actin polymerization complex
the arp2/ <dig> complex consists of  <dig> subunits that regulate actin polymerization at the leading edge in motile cells  <cit> , as well as providing a propulsive force to move endosomes throughout the cytoplasm  <cit> . arp2/ <dig> is a major nucleator of actin polymerization in most eukaryotic cells; however, our phylogenetic analyses of the apicomplexan actin-related proteins did not show homologues to either arp <dig> or arp <dig> . notably, arp <dig> and arp <dig> homologues have been previously annotated in both the plasmodium and cryptosporidium genome databases . these proteins correspond to our annotations pfalp5a, pfalp5b, cpalp7a, and cpalp7b, respectively. phylogenetic comparisons do not support these previously proposed annotations, but rather indicate that these actin-like proteins are part of other alp groups .

a recent analysis of the actin family from model organisms was utilized to derive predictive models for grouping arp groups in a variety of taxa  <cit> . importantly, this analysis also found arp <dig>  arp <dig>  and arp <dig> homologues among the apicomplexa  but failed to identify orthologues of arp <dig>  arp <dig> or other arp groups  <cit> . collectively, these findings indicate apicomplexans do not encode a conserved arp2/ <dig> complex.

we also searched for the other  <dig> subunits of the arp2/ <dig> complex that are known as actin-related protein complex  <dig> /p <dig>  arpc2/p <dig>  arpc3/p <dig>  arpc4/p <dig>  and arpc5/p <dig>  a separately recognized domain is only described for arpc4/p <dig> , perhaps reflecting the divergence of the remaining subunits across the many taxa where they are readily identified by blast. we conducted genome-wide blast searches of apicomplexans as described above using arpc proteins from mammals, flies, yeast, plants, and protozoa  . no proteins with similarity to subunits arpc <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were found in any of the four apicomplexan genomes.

potential orthologues to the arpc1/p <dig> were found in plasmodium and cryptosporidium : both of these proteins contain wd <dig> repeats, which are a distinguishing feature of the arpc1/p <dig> proteins in other eukaryotes  <cit> . this analysis was supported by blast and also by protein domain searches using prosite, which identified wd <dig> repeat domains in both proteins . wd <dig> repeats mediate protein-protein interactions and are involved in regulating numerous biological functions in addition to their role in actin nucleation  <cit> . since arpc1/p <dig> is not necessary for the overall cohesiveness of the arp2/ <dig> subunits  <cit> , we can hypothesize this protein may serve an alternative function outside of the arp2/ <dig> complex in plasmodium and cryptosporidium.

surprisingly, cryptosporidium encodes a conserved arpc4/p <dig> subunit as shown by blast analysis and by prosite domain similarity  . in other eukaryotes, arpc <dig> forms a stable heterodimeric complex with arpc2/p <dig> that comprises the structural core of the arp2/ <dig> complex  <cit> . in the absence of arpc4/p <dig>  arp2/ <dig> complexes are not formed  <cit> , underscoring its importance to the protein scaffold. it is therefore unusual that cryptosporidium would retain a close orthologue to one subunit and completely lack the other . additionally, the arpc2/arpc <dig> heterodimer binds actin filaments and is thought to be necessary for branching of daughter filaments from existing mother filaments  <cit> . actin in toxoplasma does not appear to be branched  <cit> , thus it is unclear why cryptosporidium maintains an arpc <dig> homologue .

the presence of remnant arpc1/p <dig> homologues in plasmodium and cryptosporidium, and arpc4/p <dig> in cryptosporidium indicates that the complex may have been functional at one time in these parasites; however, they either have since lost the complex completely or the subunits have diverged to the extent that they are no longer recognizable. support for this hypothesis comes from other alveolates, such as the closely-related but deeper branching ciliate lineages  <cit> . the ciliate tetrahymena thermophilia encodes a canonical arp2/ <dig> complex with easily recognizable arp <dig> , arp <dig> , arpc <dig> , arpc <dig>  and arpc <dig>  subunits. loss of a functional complex in the apicomplexans may have resulted from their highly specialized, intracellular lifestyles. deciphering how apicomplexans control actinfilament turnover is thus an intriguing and unanswered question. we postulate that evolution of alternative proteins, such as the alp <dig> proteins , could enable parasites to regulate actin polymerization in a more streamlined mechanism, yet maintain the overall function of the complex.

the alp <dig> group of apicomplexan-specific proteins is phylogenetically similar to both the arp <dig> and arp <dig>  alp <dig> in toxoplasma is the second closest paralogue to conventional actin with which it shares 37% identity and 57% similarity . moreover, tgalp <dig> is 49% identical to pfalp <dig> and 45% identical to cpalp <dig>  indicating the alp <dig> proteins are highly conserved within this phylum . these phylogenetic properties, in conjunction with the lack of any obvious arp <dig> or arp <dig> homologues, lead us to hypothesize that the alp <dig> proteins may play a corresponding or complementary role to these two proteins in the apicomplexans.

arps and chromatin remodeling
in addition to their cytoskeletal roles, actin and arps function in the nucleus as components of chromatin-modifying and chromatin-remodeling protein complexes  <cit> . these arps include arp <dig>  arp <dig>  arp <dig> and arp <dig>  <cit> . arps  <dig> and  <dig> are yeast-specific and do not have homologues in other eukaryotes  <cit> . our studies show the apicomplexans encode conventional arp <dig> and arp <dig> orthologues .

chromatin-modifying and -remodeling machinery are involved in dna replication, dna repair mechanisms and transcriptional regulation  <cit> . arp <dig> is present in several complexes including the nua <dig> histone acetyltransferase and several members of the atp-dependent swi2-snf <dig> family of chromatin-remodeling complexes  <cit> . in yeast, arp <dig> is also a member of swr <dig>  a subgroup of the swi2/snf <dig> chromatin-remodeling complexes  <cit> . other roles for arp <dig> include transcriptional deactivation via heterochromatin-remodeling in drosophila and vertebrates  <cit> .

changes in gene expression are important means of regulating function and such changes have been shown to play a role in parasite stage-differentiation  <cit> . the plasmodium and cryptosporidium genomes appear to lack many common transcription factors leading to the hypothesis that these parasites rely heavily on chromatin-remodeling for transcriptional control  <cit> . this is supported by the fact that apicomplexans appear to contain several components of the swi2/snf <dig> atpase chromatin-remodeling machinery  <cit> . recently, saksouk et. al. showed the first direct correlation of histone acetylation and methylation to stage-specific gene expression in toxoplasma  <cit> , supporting the importance of chromatin modification and remodeling in these parasites. the presence of conserved arp <dig> and arp <dig> orthologues suggests that actin-related proteins participate in chromatin remodeling in apicomplexans similar to other eukaryotes.

CONCLUSIONS
comprehensive analysis of the genome content of these parasites combined with phylogenetic groupings has allowed us to propose potential functions for many of these arp/alp groups. our findings indicate that apicomplexans encode a variety of actin-like proteins  that likely participate in actin-based motility, vesicle transport, and transcriptional regulation through chromatin remodeling. delineating their respective functions will ultimately enrich our understanding of these parasites, and also the evolution of the actin family as a whole.
