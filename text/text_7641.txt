BACKGROUND
bird models have been instrumental to the overall understanding of neural sex differences and endocrine influences on brain development  <cit> . japanese quail is a commonly used bird model for studying sex-specific brain development and behavior, especially the influence of the hormonal milieu during early brain development on sexual behaviour  <cit> . sex-specific neural development has traditionally been associated with sex hormones produced by the gonads. exogenous estrogen exposure before embryonic day  <dig>  causes demasculinization of the male sexual behaviour in japanese quail  <cit> , which shows the important role of sex hormones in brain differentiation. several studies in songbirds have shown that there are exceptions to this classical model  <cit> , implicating an intrinsic genetic influence on sex-specific neural development. our previous studies on gene expression in early chicken  <cit>  and quail embryos  also indicate a sex-specific brain development that is at least partly independent of the influence of gonadal hormones. quail ed <dig> corresponds roughly to chicken ed <dig> which is close to the developmental stage when gonad derived plasma testosterone levels peak  in male embryos and the endocrine hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal  axis becomes established  <cit> . endogenous gonad derived plasma estradiol levels increase gradually in female chicken embryos until ~ed <dig>  where they increase markedly  <cit> . male chicken embryo plasma estradiol levels are significantly lower than female levels at all stages although the differences become more pronounced after ed <dig>   <cit> . the establishment of the male hpg axis is believed to be dependent on both hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone release and opioid peptide regulation  <cit> . several endogenous peptides, including opioid peptides, are messengers with sex-specific activity, some of them being stored and secreted in an endocrine-like manner  <cit> . opioid peptide dependent pain and analgesia  <cit>  are well known examples of neural sex differences. pain and analgesia are conditions that are sensitive to neonatal alterations in gonadal steroid hormones  <cit> . studies using the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone on the medial preoptic area  in the anterior diencephalon point to a role for opioid peptides in the regulation of both avian and mammalian sexual behavior  <cit> .

a group of neuropeptides may have the same pre-cleavage protein precursor in common, meaning that one gene may code for several peptides with different functions. although genome information from different species has facilitated prediction of putative precursor cleavage sites and peptide/precursor amino acid sequences, little is known about the expression levels of different peptides under different conditions. this is especially true regarding the peptidome content in the developing brain. the sequencing of the chicken genome has enabled prediction and expression analysis of neuropeptides in avian models such as japanese quail. neuropeptidomics is the technological approach for detailed analysis of endogenous peptides in the brain. recently, a novel approach to study a large number of neuropeptides using nl/min flow liquid chromatography  electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was developed to investigate the endogenous neuropeptide content of brain tissue samples from rats and mice  <cit> .

the aims of this study were to characterize the endogenous peptide content of the diencephalon including the sexually dimorphic area pom in the developing quail brain and to analyze how its expression is related to age, sex and the effect of ethinylestradiol  exposure. quail ed <dig> diencephalon was chosen as both the stage of development and the tissue are of interest in this context. ed <dig> is at the end of the sensitivity period for embryonic estrogen exposure leading to behavioral alterations in male copulatory behavior  <cit>  and likely in the time period when the male endocrine hpg axis becomes established and a more marked increase of female estradiol synthesis occurs. quail ed <dig> is somewhat before hatching and a time where the male embryos lost their sensitivity to exogenous estradiol and their sex specific brain and neuroendocrine development has become established. the detection of neuropeptides and the quantification of their expression levels were done using liquid chromatography and ion trap mass spectrometry together with a label-free approach.

RESULTS
peptide identification
japanese quail embryonic diencephalon protein samples from  <dig> individuals were separated by molecular weight, obtaining <  <dig> kd samples. these samples were then examined using nano lc coupled to an esi-ltq ms system or an ltq-fticr system. a total of  <dig> peptides were identified  of which  <dig>  were present in a sufficient number of individuals to enable expression profiling . among the  <dig> peptides,  <dig> were derived from neuropeptides or neuropeptide precursor proteins. the four remaining peptides belonged to crmp- <dig>  fkbp <dig> , stathmin and thymosin beta.

 <dig>  the f-test describes the significance of the linear model that incorporates the three parameters in this study: age , and exposure . there are three levels of statistical significance for the parameter effects: p <  <dig>  , p <  <dig>   and p <  <dig>  . a minus sign  in the age effect column means that the peptide is more highly expressed in ed <dig> than ed <dig>  a minus sign  in the sex effect column means that the peptide is more highly expressed in males compared to females. a minus sign  in the ee <dig> effect column means that the peptide is more highly expressed in controls compared to exposed.  <dig>  the significance of the interaction effects was calculated by walds f-test. n.s. means non-significant.

expression profiling
a subset of the ltq-ms samples were divided into eight groups by sex , age  and ee2-exposure  with four to five samples in every group. the samples were ed <dig> male controls , ed <dig> female controls , ed <dig> male ee <dig> exposed , ed <dig> female ee <dig> exposed , ed <dig> male controls , ed <dig> female controls , ed <dig> male ee <dig> exposed  and ed <dig> female ee <dig> exposed . the alignment of peptide spectra was performed using the decyder ms software. expression data for  <dig> peptides, whereof  <dig> identified, was first analyzed by unsupervised methods  and then by a supervised method . a clear separation between ed <dig> and ed <dig> peptide expression was visible in a hierarchical clustering  of all eight experimental groups with the majority of the identified peptides being more highly expressed in ed <dig> than in ed <dig> diencephalon . a similar pattern was detected with pca .

both analyses indicate a weak separating effect of ee <dig> exposure in ed <dig> samples. pls/das were conducted to explore the maximized separation between groups regarding age, sex and ee <dig> exposure. there were no successful models separating all three parameters  leading to a pls/da model for age and ee <dig> exposure . the effect of ee <dig> exposure was more distinct on ed <dig> than on ed <dig> . a three-dimensional pls/da score plot  shows the separation of age  and ee <dig> exposure , independently of sex , with the second and third component being most effective in separating controls from ee <dig> exposure . next, a virtual importance in the projection   was plotted to see how much the identified and unidentified peptides influence the different class separations in the pls/da. the preprotachykinin  <dig> peptide neuropeptide k  was most important for overall separation among the identified peptides, followed by a peptide derived from crmp- <dig> . these two peptides also display a significantly interaction effect when using moderated f-statistics  . four unidentified peptides  were more relevant than npk . npk, the top pls/da candidate for overall effects on classes based on age and ee <dig> exposure, was also the most influential among ed <dig> samples .

multivariate analysis methods such as pca and pls/da are efficient for illustrating general trends and patterns in complex data but more limited in determining the significance/effect for single factors . an f-test was used to detect statistically significant  differences in singular peptide expression between groups regarding the response variables age, ee <dig> exposure and sex. the age differences among identified peptides were dominated by a general upregulation between ed <dig> and ed <dig> . there were a few exceptions, such as npk and the cerebellin derived peptides . only few peptides were significantly affected by either sex or ee <dig> exposure . the top ee <dig> candidates were npk and the crmp- <dig> derived peptide . this was also indicated by their localization  in the pls/da vip  and the loading scatter plot  where they are most prominent in separating control samples  from ee <dig> samples . the crmp- <dig> peptide displays ee <dig> induced downregulation of expression in males at ed <dig> and ed <dig> , whereas npk is downregulated in both males and females at ed <dig> and ed <dig> . peptides derived from gastrin-releasing peptide  and gonadotropin inhibitory hormone related peptide  <dig>  were the top candidates for sex specific differences . grp was more highly expressed  in all male groups compared to their respective female groups independent of ee <dig> exposure  and gnih-rp <dig> was more highly expressed  in ed <dig> males and in ed <dig> control males.

secretogranins
peptides from three secretogranins  were identified . two out of six scg <dig> peptides were detected in all samples. the two scg <dig> derived peptides  behave in different manners as seen by f-test statistics . both show an age effect, becoming more highly expressed in ed <dig> but only sgklsflede shows a significant interaction effect and approaches significance for a treatment effect . sgklsflede is located between two basic amino acid cleavage sites  and corresponds to human scg <dig> 285- <dig> . the full peptide probably includes an additional c-terminal methionine  if one considers the full sequence between the cleavage sites. such a peptide was also discovered  but its presence across all samples was insufficient for matching purposes. the amino acid sequence of the secretogranin- <dig>  peptide  is less conserved between birds and mammals and the peptide as such seemingly unaffected by age. the peptide is located in a non-conserved sequence region of secretogranin- <dig>  and no deduction about relevance or functionality was possible.

protachykinins
among the peptides identified, several were part of the protachykinin  <dig> precursor . representative peptide sequences for all peptide forms  except neuropeptide gamma were detected. fticr-ms enabled us to detect two previously unknown phosphorylations on the c-terminal flanking peptide , on s <dig> or s <dig>  and s <dig> . the detection of the truncated npk sequence dagygqish  shows that quail has the same sequence deletion in its protachykinin gene as seen in chicken compared to mammals. the log <dig> ion intensity levels for non-phosphorylated and single-phosphorylated ctfp isoforms were relatively similar  across all groups whereas the expression of the double-phosphorylated isoform was much lower .

discussion
there is very little known about neuropeptide expression patterns and regulation in the developing embryonic brain. this is the first peptidomics study on neuropeptide expression in the developing avian brain. a total of  <dig> peptides from the embryonic quail diencephalon were identified . using the minimum matching criteria of max one missing sample per group resulted in  <dig> matched peptides, including  <dig> identified. these were plotted for differences related to age , sex and ee <dig> exposure. the general patterns in the data set were explored using unsupervised and supervised multivariate analysis and unsupervised hierarchical clustering. these methods demonstrated a clear age separation between ed <dig> and ed <dig> individuals. the fact that most identified peptides were more highly expressed in ed <dig> compared to ed <dig> was not representative for all plotted peptides . the pca and hierarchical clustering also revealed a less distinctive but still discernable separation of control and ee <dig> exposed individuals, although mainly at ed <dig>  overall, the data indicates that the ed <dig> quail diencephalon shows a more distinct ee <dig> sensitive and sex peptide expression pattern as compared to ed <dig> . if true, it may be correlated with the establishment of the hpg axis occurring at this developmental stage in male quail embryos  <cit> . no overall sex-specific patterns were detected, which was somewhat unexpected considering the sexual dimorphic nature of the diencephalon and the large sex differences observed in birds on the mrna level  <cit> . the mrna differences are mainly based on gene dosage effects from the z chromosomes . only one peptide  in our data was derived from a gene located on the z chromosome, possibly explaining the absence of large scale sex differences. interestingly, the sex chromosome z derived grp peptide was the top candidate for sex specific peptide expression and was significantly more highly expressed in males compared to females in both controls and ee <dig> exposed individuals. the absence of general sex differences was also unexpected in relation to the detection of candidates for the demasculinizating ee <dig> effects on the copulatory behavior in adult males following embryonic estrogen exposure  <cit> .

most of the identified peptides were part of larger neuropeptide precursor proteins. peptides derived from the same secretogranin- <dig> precursor displayed expression differences indicating peptide specific regulation. both peptides were more highly expressed in ed <dig> but only sgklsflede was significantly affected over all groups  with a significant interaction effect and near significant ee <dig> treatment effect . the positioning of sgklsflede between basic amino acid pairs  and its expression pattern compared to secretoneurin indicates that it possesses a specific biological function and makes it a potential new avian neuropeptide candidate. besides sgklsflede, two other forms  were also detected, although not in all the samples. the later, sgklsfledem is probably the complete peptide as it represents the complete sequence between the two cleavage sites in the precursor protein.

previous studies have demonstrated that opioid peptides are involved in aggressive and sexual behaviors in adult japanese quail  <cit>  and also in the establishment of the male chicken embryonic hpg axis  <cit> . we detected a large number of proenkephalin precursor  derived peptides , although the majority were propeptides located in front of the opioid peptides. none of the identified opioid peptides  differed significantly between groups except with regard to age. the detection of met-enkephalin  and leu-enkephalin  propeptides indicates that met-enk and leu-enk also are expressed in the developing diencephalon. their absence may be explained by the fact that their short sequences make it more difficult to detect them with lc-ms. the presence of the complete leu-enk propeptide  in all groups and it being significantly affected by age and ee <dig> exposure plus exhibiting interaction effects  may indicate that leu-enk also is differentially expressed. among the peptides derived from another large neuropeptide precursor protein, preprotachykinin  <dig>  we identified two previously unknown phosphorylations on the c-terminal flanking peptide , on s <dig> or s <dig>  and s <dig> . quail sp possesses the same arg for lys substitution at the third position compared with humans as previously described in chicken  <cit> , alligator  <cit>  and burmese python  <cit>  whereas quail nka is identical to chicken, alligator, burmese python and human nka  <cit> . nka is the ten amino acid long c-terminal part of npk  in mammals. the lc-ms detection and identification of the truncated npk sequence dagygqish  shows that quail has the same sequence deletion in its protachykinin gene compared to mammals as seen in chicken. antisera against a mammalian npk fragment which encompasses some of the chicken npk sequence shows immunoreactivity in the developing chicken embryonic spinal cord which weakens after hatching  <cit> . the nine amino acid long quail npk could work in a functionally inert propeptide fashion to nka in quail considering that npk is converted into nka in mammals  <cit> . it is not clear if the truncated avian npk has a biological function although it is indicative that it is the top candidate for influencing overall separation in the multivariate datasets with regard to age and ee <dig> exposure, especially at ed <dig>  and becomes significantly downregulated in all groups after ee <dig> exposure . the different age dependent expression patterns seen in our data for npk and nka  can also be interpreted as involvement in separate biological processes during diencephalon development. npk is known to regulate gonadotropin secretion in the mammalian hypothalamus  <cit> , and our data indicates that this may also be true for avian diencephalon development.

there were only few peptides exhibiting sex differences in expression, the top candidates being the grp and gnih-rp <dig> peptides. the first  <dig> amino acids of grp was as previously mentioned the only chrz-derived peptide detected in our data and it was generally more highly expressed in males compared to females . grp is an interesting candidate for sex specific brain development as expression of its receptor has been related to the layering of cells in the chick telencephalon, optical tectum and cerebellum  <cit> . the gnih-rp <dig> peptide is part of the gonadotropin inhibitory hormone  precursor protein  whose main peptide  inhibits gonadotropin release in quail and is strongly expressed in all avian species studied so far  <cit> . the gnih-rp <dig> peptide was significantly differentially expressed between groups with a clear age effect from ed <dig> to ed <dig> . it also displayed significant sex and interaction effects. it should be noted that the identified sequence  is actually somewhat longer than the calculated gnih-rp <dig> sequence  and does not posses the characteristic c-terminal rf-amide. the observed peptide may be part of a larger propeptide-gnih-rp <dig> peptide sequence that has become degraded at both the n and c-terminal. the gnih precursor protein contains a neuropeptide cleavage site   <cit>  adjacent to a somewhat longer sequence  of the peptide in question . unlike gnih itself, there is little known about the role of gnih-rp peptides. although this may be the case, the overall expression pattern of this particular peptide implies a biological role in avian embryonic diencephalon development for gnih-rp <dig>  both gnih-rp peptides posses affinity for the gnih receptor  <cit> , indicating that gnih-rp <dig> is involved in the regulation of gonadotropin release from the developing pituitary. npk and gnih-rp <dig> are both potential regulators of gonadotropin regulation during diencephalon development and the male hpg axis formation. the ee <dig> effects on gnih-rp <dig> expression are not very influential/statistical significant in either type of data analysis  and therefore not conclusive. still, the fact that ee <dig> also seems to modulate gnih-rp <dig> expression  is intriguing considering that the npk expression is ee <dig> sensitive. it could indicate that the male quail embryonic window of sensitivity  before and around ed <dig> to exogenous ee <dig> exposure is partly influenced by an altered gonadotropin regulation and hpg axis formation.

it is important to note that this study is foremost of hypothesis generating nature. we have analyzed the expression of a large number of neuropeptides  under different circumstances in the developing avian brain in a manner that is impractical or impossible for the more traditional immunoassay methods. omics data is valuable when the experimental design includes several variables  but requires at the same time an increasing number of samples and makes the analysis and presentation of the results more difficult. further studies are needed to better analyze the role of the individual neuropeptides during development using for instance more data points for age or the addition of aromatase inhibitors to better deduce the impact of ee <dig>  the absence of neuropeptides such as vasotocin was for instance unexpected although this does not provide any conclusions on their presence or role in embryonic brain development. the absence of proof is not the proof of absence. peptides such as vasotocin contain two cysteine amino acids and can contain a disulfide bridge, a property that makes them more difficult to fragment and identify with ms/ms. additional peptides could for instance be detectable in less hydrophilic sample preparation buffer settings than the weakly acidic  <dig> % acetic acid buffer used in this study. future peptidomics studies such as this study may provide even more data when other sample preparations strategies or additional mass spectrometry systems besides ltq-ms are added.

CONCLUSIONS
to summarize, we report the first large scale neuropeptidomic analysis of the developing avian diencephalon at ed <dig> and ed <dig> in japanese quail, a common model for studying sex-specific neural development. the peptidome was analyzed in relation to age, sex and ee <dig> treatment at ed <dig>  both age and ee <dig> treatment affected the quail peptidome, without any clear discernible influence of gender. a potential new avian neuropeptide candidate was discovered in the secretogranin- <dig> precursor protein and previously unknown phosphorylation sites in the protachykinin c-terminal flanking peptide identified. gnih-rp <dig> and grp are likely to be differentially expressed in a sex specific manner and npk in an ee <dig> sensitive manner during embryonic brain development in japanese quail. our approach shows the strength of labeling-free lc-ms peptidomics and how to better characterize multiple known and unknown endogenous peptides in the developing organism.
