BACKGROUND
lipases  are an important group of enzymes which have been widely used in the catalysis of different reactions  <cit> . these enzymes have been applied in chemical and pharmaceutical industrial applications due to their catalytic activity in both hydrolytic and synthetic reactions. however, free lipases are easily inactivated and difficult to recover for reuse. therefore, especially in large-scale applications, lipases are often immobilized on solid supports in order to facilitate recovery and improve operational stability under a wide variety of reaction conditions. some lipase immobilization strategies involve the conjugation of lipases via covalent attachment, cross-linking, adsorption and entrapment onto hydrophobic or hydrophilic polymeric and inorganic matrixes  <cit> .

in recent years, magnetic nanoparticles  based on iron oxides, have attracted much interest thanks to their multifunctional properties, such as biocompatibility, superparamagnetism, small size and low toxicity  <cit> . they have been applied in magnetic resonance imaging   <cit> , biosensors  <cit>  and as anti-cancer drugs carriers  <cit> . due to their high specific surface area and easy separation from the reaction medium by the use of a magnet, they have been employed in enzymatic catalysis applications  <cit> . typical strategies for immobilizing lipase onto mnps rely on surface grafting via low molecular weight linkers or polymers containing amino or epoxy functional groups to which lipases are reacted via covalent conjugation methods  <cit> . using such methods, the maximum reported loading capacity of lipase on nanoparticles is approximately  <dig> mg/g, using a complex methodology  <cit> . one drawback of existing lipase immobilization technologies is that the activity of lipases decreases significantly upon immobilization due possibly to changes in enzyme secondary structure, or limited access of substrate to the active site of the surface bound enzyme  <cit> . thus, despite numerous reported approaches for immobilization of lipases on magnetic nanoparticles, there is still the need for simple, cost-effective and high loading capacity methods.

in this work, we present a facile, biomimetic approach to immobilize lipases onto iron oxide mnp surfaces modified with polydopamine, an in-situ formed coating inspired by the adhesive proteins secreted by marine mussels  <cit> . the ortho-dihydroxyphenyl  functional group found in dopamine is also present in mussel adhesive proteins in the form of the amino acid dopa, where it is highly adhesive to oxide surfaces  <cit>  and under alkaline conditions oxidizes to form quinone, a species that is reactive toward nucleophiles such as primary amines. dopamine, containing both catechol and primary amine, was previously found to produce conformal coatings on surfaces by self-polymerization  <cit> , which are further capable of immobilizing biomolecules  <cit> . in the method described here, polydopamine serves as a conformal coating for the purposes of lipase immobilization onto mnps. our results demonstrate that pd-mnps exhibit high efficiency for lipase immobilization under aqueous conditions, and the enzyme retains high activity after many cycles of magnetic separation and reuse.

RESULTS
overall strategy for preparing lipase immobilized iron oxide mnps
our two-step method of polydopamine surface modification and lipase immobilization is illustrated in figure  <dig>  iron oxide mnps prepared by alkaline co-precipitation of fe and fe were first incubated in an alkaline dopamine solution for several hours to create an adherent polydopamine film on mnps , after which enzyme was immobilized by exposure of pd-mnps to a lipase containing solution.

synthesis and characterization of mnps and pd-mnps
catechol derivatized polymers have been previously employed for grafting functional polymers onto surfaces of mnps  <cit> . in the present work we took advantage of dopamine self-polymerization to form mnps with polydopamine coatings. in-situ polymerization of dopamine represents a versatile method for modifying solid surfaces with adherent coatings for a variety of functional purposes  <cit> . the reactions that occur in an alkaline dopamine solution are not unlike those that occur during melanin formation, beginning with oxidation of catechol to yield dopamine quinone, which in turn participates in a series of further intra- and intermolecular reactions that ultimately give rise to a high molecular weight heterogeneous polymer . polydopamine formation occurs both in solution and as a conformal coating on surfaces. in the present case involving iron oxide mnps, the polydopamine is likely bound to the surface and even nucleated by dopamine molecules that strongly interact with the oxide surface  <cit> .

x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy  spectra of the mnps and pd-mnps are shown in figure  <dig>  whereas the unmodified mnps contained little carbon and nitrogen content , the xps spectrum of pd-mnps contained prominent peaks correlating to c1s  and n1s  . the calculated nitrogen-to-carbon  ratio of the pd-mnps is  <dig> , which is close to the theoretical n/c of  <dig>  for dopamine. additionally, the fe 2p  peaks are attenuated in pd-mnps compared to mnps due to the presence of the polydopamine coating. further evidence for polydopamine coating is provided by a shift of the o1s peak from  <dig>  ev in mnps and corresponding to iron oxide, to  <dig> ev corresponding to organic oxygen.

the size and morphology of the mnps and the pd-mnps were observed by sem and tem . the unmodified mnps were composed of clusters of nanoparticles with sizes ranging from  <dig> nm to  <dig> nm. in comparison, sem and tem images of the pd-mnps reveal aggregates iron oxide particles entrapped in a conformal polydopamine coating of approximate thickness  <dig> nm. the average size of the pd-mnps agglomerates ranged from  <dig> nm to  <dig> nm. although some observed aggregation could be caused by drying during tem sample preparation  <cit> , it is also possible that polydopamine induced partial aggregation of mnp clusters.

magnetic isolation of pd-mnps was accomplished by placing a magnet adjacent to a vial containing pd-mnps dispersed in an aqueous medium . within two minutes the solution became clear as a result of movement of the pd-mnps towards the magnet, demonstrating simple and rapid isolation of pd-mnps using a magnetic field. removal of the magnet followed by agitation led to re-suspension of the pd-mnps.

lipase immobilization onto pd-mnps
after formation, the polydopamine coating contains residual quinones that are reactive toward nucleophilic groups, affording covalent immobilization of polymers and biomolecules through michael addition and/or schiff base formation  <cit> . in the present case, similar reactions between the active quinone groups at the surface of the pd-mnps and the amino or thiol groups of the lipase enzyme result in lipase immobilization onto the surfaces of the pd-mnps during the lipase immobilization step . the reaction between pd-mnps and lipase was spontaneous and rapid, resulting in precipitation of lipase-containing mnps particles soon after mixing. analysis of free protein concentration in solution during lipase immobilization at 4°c showed little change after  <dig> hours, further confirming the completion of the immobilization reaction.

xps analysis of the lipase immobilized pd-mnps  showed increases in the n1s peak  and the calculated n/c ratio  compared to pd-mnps, reflecting the higher nitrogen content of lipase compared to polydopamine. little change in aggregate appearance and morphology was observed upon immobilization of lipase onto pd-mnps, although sem and tem analysis  revealed further agglomeration . it is not known whether the additional aggregation occurred during lipase immobilization or was an artifact of em sample preparation.

lipase immobilization efficiency as well as the activity of bound enzyme was found to be dependent on conditions used during preparation of pd-mnps and immobilization of lipase . in the absence of polydopamine treatment, binding of lipase to mnps was inefficient and resulted in low activity. through the use of polydopamine, the amount of bound lipase was increased by as much as 3-fold. increasing the concentration of dopamine used in preparing the pd-mnps in the range  <dig>  -  <dig>  mg/ml resulted in an increase in bound lipase from  <dig>  mg to  <dig>  mg coupled with an increase in enzyme specific activity from  <dig>  to  <dig>  u/mg. these results show that polydopamine is essential for immobilization of high amounts of lipase enzyme onto mnps. however, taking into consideration the cost of enzyme and that specific activity of bound lipase did not significantly increase above initial dopamine concentration of  <dig>  mg/ml, we identified optimum conditions to be polydopamine deposition at  <dig>  mg/ml dopamine concentration followed by lipase immobilization at a 2: <dig>  ratio of pd-mnps to lipase. under these conditions we achieved a lipase loading of  <dig> mg/g of material  with  <dig>  u/mg specific activity , much higher than previous reports  <cit> .

effect of temperature and ph on free and immobilized lipase activity
the effect of temperature on the activity of free and immobilized lipase at ph  <dig>  is shown in figure  <dig>  the activity of both free and immobilized lipase is not adversely affected at temperatures below 40°c. the relative activity of free lipase dropped significantly above 40°c and decreased to just  <dig> % of the initial activity at 60°c. in comparison, lipase immobilized on pd-mnps retained  <dig> % of activity at 60°c. a possible explanation for this is enhanced thermal stability in the immobilized state, leading to less denaturation of protein  <cit> .

the effect of ph on the relative activity of free and immobilized lipase is shown in figure  <dig>  according to our data, the activity of lipase immobilized on pd-mnps was retained throughout a wider ph range compared to free enzyme. at ph 6- <dig>  free lipase was stable for short incubation periods but was adversely affected at longer incubation times, retaining only 60-70% of the activity after  <dig> h incubation. at ph  <dig> and  <dig> only 30-40% of the activity of the free enzyme was retained after  <dig> h, and complete loss in activity was observed for free lipase upon incubation at ph  <dig> and  <dig>  in contrast, pd- lipase immobilized on mnps retained more than 90% of activity at ph  <dig> and  <dig>  and even retained more than 50% of activity after  <dig> hours incubation at ph  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the increased stability of immobilized lipase may result from multipoint covalent linking between lipase and the pd-mnps, which prevents lipase denaturation in acid or alkaline environments  <cit> .

magnetic isolation and reuse
reuse of enzymes in industrial processes is advantageous from an economic point of view. we therefore investigated this feature in lipase immobilized pd-mnps, whose magnetic properties and enhanced enzyme stability were designed to facilitate multiple cycles of magnetic isolation and reuse. figure  <dig> shows the activity of lipase immobilized pd-mnps after multiple cycles of magnetic separation and reuse. although the activity of the immobilized lipase began to decrease after  <dig> cycles, more than 70% of its initial activity was still retained after  <dig> cycles. the decrease of activity may be caused by aggregation and loss of particles during magnetic isolation, denaturation of protein and the gradual loss of lipase from the pd-mnps.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we described a facile method to immobilize lipase onto magnetic nanoparticles through an adhesive polydopamine film. our immobilization experiments show that the pd-mnps exhibit high lipase loading capacity due to high surface area and strong adhesive interactions between lipase and polydopamine. in addition, the immobilized lipase shows high specific activity and favorable thermal and ph stability compared to free lipase. importantly, the lipase immobilized pd-mnps display good reusability as well as the convenience to be magnetically recovered. these results confirm that immobilization of enzyme onto magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles by poly-dopamine film, is economical, facile and efficient.
