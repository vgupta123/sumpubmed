BACKGROUND
cell migration involves the coordinated regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and cell adhesion turnover, and is directed by extracellular stimuli, including chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and the extracellular matrix  <cit> . cell migration is essential for embryonic development and wound healing, but also contributes to the pathogenesis of human diseases, such as cancer, autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammation. targeted inhibition of molecules involved in cell migration could, therefore, be used to treat several human diseases. many intracellular signalling proteins have been implicated in cell migration, and, in particular, rho gtpases are known to contribute to multiple cellular processes that affect cell migration  <cit> . regulators of actin cytoskeletal dynamics, including formins and wasp/wave-related proteins, are key targets of cell migration signalling  <cit> .

the contribution of proteins to cell migration can be assessed using scratch wound assays, which quantify the time required for cells to migrate into and fill a gap created in a cell monolayer. several groups have recently adapted this type of approach for high-throughput rnai screening to identify new regulators of cell migration. an rnai screen for scratch-wound closure in mcf10a breast epithelial cells that targeted all kinases and phosphatases, together with other selected genes implicated in cell migration, revealed that cell speed in this model was increased by knockdown of genes that reduced cell-cell adhesion  <cit> . using a similar approach, a screen of sirnas targeting over  <dig>  genes in skov <dig> ovarian cancer cells identified five genes including three kinases that potently reduced cell migration  <cit> . other screening approaches have also identified novel regulators of cell migration. for example, genome-wide rnai screen in caenorhabditis elegans identified  <dig> genes that affected migration of the distal tip cells during gonadogenesis  <cit> .

since many of the genes identified in these screens affect cell migration indirectly, for example, by altering cell division and growth, we chose to take a different approach. to select for potential novel regulators of cell migration we used a morphology screen in drosophila cells to identify conserved proteins that alter cell shape and actin filament distribution. rnai was then used to test the roles of the human counterparts of these genes in cytoskeletal organisation and cell migration. this approach proved highly effective in identifying functionally conserved genes, identifying  <dig> conserved human proteins that are required for normal cytoskeletal organisation and cell morphology in prostate cancer-derived pc <dig> cells and hela cells. significantly, a large number of these putative novel cytoskeletal regulators were found to alter cell migration and several have previously been implicated in human diseases, providing a new set of potential therapeutic targets.

RESULTS
selection of putative motility modifier genes
we used the results of a genome-wide rnai morphological screen in drosophila melanogaster s2r+ cells  <cit>  to select genes that altered the shape of s2r+ cells, but for which the function in drosophila was not previously known. a bioinformatic approach was then used to select a subset of  <dig> of these genes for which there was little or no evidence of a role in regulating cell shape, but for which there was some other information on their function . we used functional information from studies of their homologues in other organisms , on whether they were hits in any other genetic screens, had known interaction partners in humans or other species  or putative interaction partners based on large scale screens, and known or predicted protein domains . for example, cg <dig> was selected because the mammalian homologue arc is known to bind to actin, whereas cg <dig> was selected because a human homologue hypc interacts with huntingtin. the human homologues of these  <dig> genes were identified , yielding a group of  <dig> human genes. nine of the drosophila genes have a single human homologue, while the remaining genes have two or three human paralogues. these genes were named 'putative motility modifiers' .

the  <dig> drosophila gene names and the hgnc gene symbol  and full name  of the  <dig> human homologues are shown. alternative names  are listed.

morphology screen of pmm genes
to identify roles for these genes in regulating cell morphology in human cells, each of the  <dig> human pmm genes was knocked down in pc <dig> prostate carcinoma cells, which grow and migrate as single cells without strong cell-cell adhesions, using pools of four sirnas. in this analysis,  <dig> of the  <dig> pmms had a discernable effect on cytoskeletal organization and/or cell shape . in order to identify genes that induced similar changes and, hence, could act on a similar pathway, cells were classified for  <dig> different parameters:  <dig> distinct f-actin distributions, presence of microtubule-containing processes,  <dig> different cell shapes, spread area, and the presence of multinucleate cells . these were compared to the phenotypes induced by knockdown of known regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, including the rho gtpases rhoa, rac <dig>  cdc <dig> and rhou/wrch <dig> and the actin polymerization regulators capzb, cofilin , mdia <dig>  and wave <dig> 

strong patches 8%
cortical actin 12%
phenotypes were classified three days after transfection with sirna pools targeting each of the  <dig> pmms or  <dig> known regulators of the actin cytoskeleton . cells were fixed and stained for f-actin, microtubules, and dna . three to four different images from two different screens were analysed; total number of cells analysed/condition ≥  <dig>  the most prominent phenotype for each gene is highlighted in bold text and the percent of cells showing this phenotype is shown in brackets . definitions of actin phenotypes: stress fibres, multiple thick straight f-actin cables/cell; cortical actin, increased f-actin on regions of the plasma membrane; spots, small bright regions of f-actin; strong patches, large bright regions of f-actin; rough edge, free edges of cells are wavy or indented; smooth, f-actin levels similar throughout cytoplasm; low, lower f-actin levels than control cells. microtubule phenotype: processes, long narrow membrane extensions containing microtubules. definitions of cell shape: larger, spread area increased compared to control cells; elongated, cell body length ≥  <dig> × width; very elongated, cell body length ≥  <dig> × width; rounded, length ~ = width. np, no phenotype.

this analysis of parameters revealed seven major groups of genes based on their predominant phenotype in the sirna screen , which could reflect functional interaction between members of each group. for comparison, the percent of control cells demonstrating each parameter is shown.

the first pmm group, arc and zranb <dig> , both induced a strong increase in stress fibres, which are normally only rarely observed in pc <dig> cells . they also increased the spread area and the percent of multinucleate cells . zranb1/trabid is a deubiquitinase previously linked to wnt signalling  <cit> , whereas arc binds to actin filaments  <cit> . the similar phenotype induced by these two genes suggests that zranb <dig> might regulate arc. of the known actin regulators, only rac <dig> depletion increased stress fibres, although to a lesser extent than zranb <dig> or arc.

pmm group  <dig> increased the level of cortical actin filaments  and often altered the membrane morphology. this included fam40a and fmnl <dig>  which showed an increase in f-actin-rich lamellae around the cell periphery. a subset also made the cells larger, presumably by promoting cell spreading through the cortical f-actin changes. pmm group  <dig> also affected cortical f-actin but were most striking for the presence of long thin microtubule-containing processes as their most dominant phenotype. the cell shape was not altered, but at least 25% of the cells had one narrow straight process that often extended over multiple neighbouring cells . occasionally cells had two processes. note that depletion of several pmms in groups  <dig> and  <dig> also induced an increase in cells with microtubule-containing processes . this suggests that all these proteins are linked in normally suppressing microtubule-based protrusions. this could reflect the known role of the actin cytoskeleton in limiting the generation of microtubule-based protrusions as previously described in drosophila cells in culture  <cit> . knockdown of pmm group  <dig> genes, including fam40b and fmnl <dig>  induced an elongated phenotype . group  <dig> genes were characterized by a very elongated bipolar phenotype , and included rhou and the formin mdia <dig> . rhou has previously been reported to affect integrin-mediated adhesions  <cit> , and thus this very elongated phenotype could reflect altered adhesion, and/or changes to localized actin polymerization. notably, wave <dig>  an arp2/ <dig> complex actin nucleation promoting factor that is known to contribute to lamellipodium formation, was also in this group  <cit> . pmm group  <dig> genes had strong patches of f-actin, and included genes encoding the actin filament capping protein capzb, the actin filament severing and depolymerising protein cofilin <dig> , and pdzk <dig>  cfl <dig> and capzb depletion are known to reduce actin filament depolymerization and capping respectively, thereby promoting focal increases in f-actin  <cit> . very little is known about pdzk <dig> except that it interacts with hiv gag protein and promotes hiv infection. interestingly, cofilin plays a role in hiv entry through the hiv receptor cxcr <dig>  <cit> . our data suggest that pdzk <dig> and cfl <dig> could act together during this process. pmm group  <dig>  including cdc <dig>  induced a rounded cell shape as the predominant phenotype , likely reflecting a decrease in cell spreading  <cit> . this includes the closely related homologues brwd <dig> and brwd <dig>  which are likely to encode transcriptional regulators , and, hence, might regulate the expression of other genes in the group.

hypc was unique in leading to a reduction in f-actin levels , and did not fit into any of the groups. finally, epb41l4a did not induce any discernable phenotype in pc <dig> cells, although it was selected on the basis of its morphological phenotype in drosophila s2r+ cells. it is possible that epb41l4a is not expressed in pc <dig> cells.

interestingly, closely related homologues were generally in different groups; for example, the formins fmnl <dig>  fmnl <dig> and fmnl <dig>  and fam40a and fam40b .

cell migration screen of pmm genes
to determine whether the morphological changes induced by pmm depletion led to changes in migration, we tested the effects of knocking down expression of each pmm on cell migration using scratch wound assays. migration of cells was monitored by time-lapse microscopy , and the change in wound size over time was quantified using an automated method of image analysis . these results were used to generate graphs showing the relative velocity of wound closure . of the pmms, depletion of fmnl <dig>  fnbp <dig>  arc, zranb <dig> and limd <dig> led to the strongest inhibition of wound closure. notably, arc and zranb <dig> form pmm group  <dig>  and have an increase in stress fibres and larger spread area . stress fibres can often inhibit cell migration  <cit> . fmnl <dig>  fnbp <dig> and limd <dig> are all part of pmm group  <dig>  and have an elongated shape. interestingly, the other members of this group also reduced migration . by contrast, closely related homologues of fmnl <dig>  and fnbp <dig>  were in different groups and did not significantly affect migration . opposite to group  <dig> pmms, the group  <dig> pmms wave <dig>  diaph <dig>  rhou and larp <dig>  tended to increase rather than decrease cell migration . taken together, these results imply that either an increase in stress fibres or an elongated phenotype inhibits migration of pc <dig> cells into scratch wounds, whereas very elongated bipolar cells can migrate more rapidly.

selection of subset of seven pmms
from the  <dig> pmms, a subset of  <dig> was chosen for further analysis, based on their phenotypes in the morphology and migration screens. these genes included the five that most strongly inhibited migration in scratch wounds when knocked down, arc, zranb <dig>  fmnl <dig>  fnbp <dig>  and limd <dig> . we also included two closely related genes, fam40a and fam40b, which had only a small effect on migration in scratch wound assays , but which each had profound effects on cell shape : fam40a depletion resulted in flatter cells, whereas fam40b depletion increased elongation and is in the same pmm group as fmnl <dig>  fnbp <dig> and limd <dig>  to validate these hits, we began by deconvoluting each sirna pool to test the phenotypic effects of using the four single sirnas individually. at least three of the four single oligonucleotide sirnas induced a similar phenotype to that seen using the pool in pc <dig> cells and/or hela cells , implying that the henotypes arise as the result of rnai-mediated silencing of the targeted gene rather than off-target effects.

to analyse further how the seven selected pmms affect cell migration, we imaged cells migrating into the wound. most control sirna-transfected cells detached from their neighbours and migrated directionally to fill the gap exposed as the result of the scratch wound . as expected from the quantification of scratch wound migration , arc, zranb <dig>  fmnl <dig>  fnbp <dig> and limd <dig> depletion strongly inhibited migration into the wound . most cells did not detach from neighbouring cells, in contrast to the control sirna-transfected cells. fam40b is in the same pmm group  <dig> as fmnl <dig>  fnbp <dig> and limd <dig>  but did not affect scratch wound migration as strongly . depletion of each of these pmm group  <dig> genes induced an elongated phenotype in the movies, but fam40b-depleted cells were able to detach from neighbours and could move further into the wound , fam40a-depleted cells were also able to migrate into the wound but migrated with a very different phenotype to fam40b-depleted cells. they had broad lamellipodia extending into the wound edge, consistent with the broad lamellar phenotype observed in the morphology screen .

effects of selected pmms on pc <dig> cell cytoskeletal organization and migration
the seven selected pmms were further analysed for their effects on morphology and migration of sub-confluent pc <dig> cells . pc <dig> cells normally have very few stress fibres, but arc and zranb <dig> depletion led to the formation of stress fibres and strong cortical f-actin bundles at the periphery of cells , as already observed in the screen analysis . limd1-depleted cells also often exhibited strong cortical f-actin bundles but no stress fibres, and in many cells microtubules were disorganized without any clear association with an mtoc. fmnl <dig> and fnbp <dig> knockdown cells were elongated and had long protrusions that extended over neighbouring cells, often with multiple short actin filament bundles at their tips. microtubules extended right along these protrusions into the tips. fam40b-depleted cells also often had very long thin protrusions containing microtubules, but showed no change in f-actin bundling compared to control cells , and thus were clearly distinct from fmnl <dig> and fnbp <dig> knockdown cells. this correlates with the scratch wound analysis, which indicated that the fam40b morphology was different from fmnl <dig> or fnbp <dig> . fam40b-depleted cells were more elongated than control cells , as already observed from the screen analysis . fam40a knockdown cells were less spread than controls and often had a broad lamellipodium . some cells had an intense region of f-actin staining at the opposite side to the lamellipodium, resembling the uropod of leukocytes  <cit> .

to determine the effect of each pmm on the random migration of single pc <dig> cells, time-lapse movies of pmm-depleted cells were used to generate cell tracks  and determine cell migration speed . fnbp3-depleted cells showed the least displacement from their point of origin and lowest migration speed, and limd <dig>  arc, fmnl <dig> and zranb <dig> knockdown cells all showed a strong decrease in migration speed, correlating with their migratory behaviour in the scratch wound assay . only fam40a-depleted cells had a similar migration speed to control cells .

phenotypes of pmm-depleted hela cells
to determine whether depletion of each of the seven selected pmms induced a similar phenotype in a different cell type, we tested their effects in hela cells . arc, limd <dig> and zranb <dig> depletion had qualitatively similar effects in hela cells to pc <dig> cells. arc depletion led to a strong increase in thick actin filament bundles at the edges of cells, and in some cells to an increase in stress fibres, similar to the response of pc <dig> cells. limd <dig> depletion increased stress fibres and/or cortical f-actin bundles in a proportion of cells, somewhat similar to arc depletion. zranb <dig> knockdown led to a strong increase in f-actin bundles along cell edges and some increase in stress fibres, although these were not as thick as those in arc or limd-depleted cells. zranb <dig> knockdown cells also had fewer lamellipodia.

the effects of fam40a, fam40b, fmnl <dig> and fnbp <dig> depletion were different between the two cell types, probably reflecting the different intrinsic phenotypes of hela versus pc <dig> cells. in contrast to pc <dig> cells, hela cells exhibit cell-cell adhesions. in addition, within the pc <dig> cell population there are some elongated cells, whereas the hela cell populations are more regular in shape with very few elongated cells under normal conditions . pc <dig> cells frequently became very elongated with long protrusions in response to pmm knockdown , and fam40b, fmnl <dig> and fnbp <dig> depletion induced elongation of pc <dig> cells  but not in hela cells . fam40b-depleted hela cells had very bright regions of f-actin staining around the periphery associated with lamellipodia and filopodia, but very few thick cortical f-actin bundles. in addition, fam40b-depleted hela cells appeared to detach from each other and had reduced cell-cell adhesion . a reduction in cell-cell adhesion was also apparent in the scratch wound images from fam40b-depleted pc <dig> cells . fmnl <dig> depletion did not have a strong effect on hela cell morphology, which might reflect differences in the relative levels of fmnl <dig> in hela and pc <dig> cells compared to fmnl <dig> and fmnl <dig>  finally, knockdown of fnbp <dig> in hela cells appeared to inhibit cytokinesis, since many cells were binucleate . in addition, cells had multiple filopodia/microspikes, both linking between cells and at cell edges away from cell-cell interactions . like fam40b knockdown, this could indicate a reduction in cell-cell adhesion.

over-expression of fam40a and fam40b induces actin reorganization
to investigate how overexpression of selected pmms affected cell morphology and cytoskeletal organisation and to determine their localization, cdnas for arc, fam40a, fam40b, fmnl <dig> and zranb <dig> were cloned downstream of gfp and transfected into pc <dig> cells . gfp-arc, fam40a, fam40b and fmnl <dig> proteins showed cytoplasmic localization with some enrichment on the plasma membrane compared to gfp alone . in particular, fmnl <dig> and fam40b were localized in lamellipodia. in contrast, zranb <dig>  showed punctate localization in the cytoplasm, similar to a previous report  <cit> . expression of fam40a reduced pc <dig> cell area compared with control cells , similar to knockdown of fam40a, suggesting that fam40a levels are critical for regulating cell spreading. in hela cells, expression of fam40b increased cortical f-actin bundles , consistent with the decrease of thick cortical f-actin bundles observed in fam40b-depleted hela cells . the other pmms had no consistent effect on cell shape or actin filament distribution.

discussion
here we identify multiple novel regulators of cell morphology, cytoskeletal organisation and migration, many of which are implicated in human diseases and signal transduction processes. sixteen genes were chosen based on their identification in a genome-wide drosophila cell morphology screen followed by bioinformatic analysis of their domain structure, interacting partners and potential functions in other species. of the  <dig> human genes identified as homologues of these drosophila genes, nearly all affected cell shape and/or migration in pc <dig> prostate carcinoma cells, implying that these genes have conserved functions between drosophila and human cells. based on morphological analysis, these genes could be divided into six distinct groups, and this grouping was reflected in their effects on migration. this could in the future allow prediction of migratory behaviour based on cytoskeletal and shape analysis.

the pmm genes have not previously been identified in rnai-based migration screens; for example, they were not in the gene set analysed by simpson et al.  <cit>  because they are not kinases, phosphatases or previously known regulators of cell migration. they were not identified in another migration screen of  <dig>  genes  <cit> , but the complete gene list is not provided for this screen.

of the seven pmm genes chosen for in-depth characterization, the closely related fam40a and fam40b genes had clearly distinct phenotypes: fam40a-depleted cells had an increase in f-actin around the periphery and a circular shape, whereas fam40b-depleted cells were highly elongated. however, knockdown of each of these genes only led to a mild decrease in migration in scratch wounds. indeed, other genes that induced cell elongation in pc <dig> cells did not affect migration, indicating that under the conditions we have analysed elongation is not predictive of a cell migration defect. very little is known about fam <dig> genes but interestingly they are conserved from fungi and amoebae to humans, although we have been unable to find a homologue in plants. the yeast homologue is far <dig> , which in s. cerevisiae interacts with other far proteins and causes a far3-like pheromone arrest phenotype when disrupted  <cit> . protein-protein interaction databases report that far <dig> interacts with rom <dig>  a gef for the rho gtpases rho <dig> and rho <dig> , as well as rho <dig> and tpd <dig>  <cit> . in human cells, fam40a and fam40b have recently been isolated as part of a striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase  complex, that also contains pp2a phosphatases, striatins, mob1/ <dig> and members of the ste <dig> kinase family  <cit> . interestingly, s. cerevisiae far <dig> shares sequence similarity with the striatins, and tpd <dig>  a pp2a-a orthologue, has been found as an interacting partner with far <dig> in yeast two-hybrid assay  <cit> . altogether these data suggest that fam40a and fam40b could be part of a protein complex conserved from yeast to humans. functions of the stripak complex are still to be determined but it is possible it plays a role in intracellular trafficking, and/or in cytoskeletal changes, since yeast mob <dig> is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization during exit from mitosis and cytokinesis  <cit> .

fmnl <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are part of the diaphanous-related formin family of proteins, several of which have been shown to be regulated by rho gtpases  <cit> . depletion of each of the three fmnl proteins induced an increase in peripheral f-actin rich lamellipodial protrusions in pc <dig> cells, but only fmnl <dig> knockdown significantly inhibited migration in scratch wounds. fmnl1/frlα has been shown to stimulate actin polymerization, bind to rac <dig>  and regulate macrophage motility  <cit> . fmnl <dig> and fmnl <dig> have recently been reported to bind to rhoc and regulate migration and invasion  <cit> . our observation that fmnl <dig> severely impairs migration and localizes in part to lamellipodia is in accordance with these observations.

formin family proteins have multiple binding partners, known as formin-binding proteins . it is interesting that we identified that depletion of a fbp, fnbp <dig>  strongly inhibits migration, similar to fmnl <dig> knockdown. its close relative hypc did not have a marked effect on migration or morphology of pc <dig> cells, which might reflect low-level expression compared to fnbp <dig>  fnbp <dig>  was identified in a screen for formin-1-binding proteins, which identified multiple proteins with ww domains  <cit> . however, of these ww domain-containing fbps, only fbp <dig> has been characterized in detail  <cit> . fnbp <dig> and hypc are orthologues of the s. cerevisiae splicing factor prp <dig>  but whether they have a role in splicing in mammals is not known. fnbp <dig> has been reported to interact with n-wasp and inhibit its translocation to the cytoplasm  <cit>  and both fnbp <dig> and hypc interact with the n-terminus of huntingtin   <cit> , but little is known of the functional relevance of these interactions. our results, showing that fnbp <dig> depletion strongly inhibits cell migration in pc <dig> cells and cytokinesis in hela cells, imply that fnbp <dig> is likely to act through a formin family protein, which is known to affect cell protrusion and cytokinesis  <cit> . it would be interesting to know whether fnbp <dig> and fmnl <dig> act together to regulate cell migration, although only fnbp <dig> has an effect on cytokinesis so would be expected to act through a different formin for this process.

limd <dig> and wtip are members of the lim domain-containing the ajuba/zyxin family. several members of the family, such as zyxin, are involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and also translocate to the nucleus where they regulate gene expression  <cit> . limd <dig> and wtip also appear to be multifunctional proteins. limd <dig> is implicated in osteoclast development through effects on transcription factor activity  <cit> , but has also been reported to localise to focal adhesions  <cit> . wtip interacts with and affects the transcriptional activity of wilm's tumour protein, yet also localizes to cell-cell junctions and podocytes in kidney cells  <cit> , and interacts with the receptor tyrosine kinase ror <dig>  <cit> . limd <dig> and wtip depletion induce distinct changes in actin organization: limd <dig> knockdown leads to an increase in peripheral f-actin bundles and stress fibres , whereas wtip knockdown induces the formation of small f-actin-rich protrusions. these effects could be mediated by nuclear or cytoplasmic functions of limd <dig> and wtip.

unlike the other pmm genes we analysed in detail, arc  and zranb <dig> are each unique genes without closely related isoforms in mammals. depletion of each of them strongly inhibits migration of pc <dig> cells and, like limd <dig> knockdown, increased stress fibres. arc was originally identified as a gene rapidly induced by neuronal activity  <cit> , and mice lacking arc have deficits in long-term memory  <cit> . arc has also been implicated in endocytosis through interactions with endophilin and dynamin  <cit> . our data indicate for the first time that it plays an important role in cancer cell migration and actin cytoskeletal organization, which could be linked to endocytosis, although it does not specifically localize to vesicular structures.

zranb <dig>  has three zinc-finger domains and a ubiquitin thioesterase domain, and has been reported to de-ubiquitinate apc and, thereby, regulate wnt signalling  <cit> . it also binds to traf <dig>  which in turn associates with tnf-receptor family members  <cit> . it is possible that it regulates cell migration and stress fibres through effects on apc ubiquitination, which is known to affect microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> , although it could also deubiquitinate other proteins involved in cell migration.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that multiple proteins affecting cell shape and cytoskeletal organization are conserved from drosophila to human cells, and that they can be divided into groups that reflect their morphology and effects on migration. where one drosophila gene has two or more closely related paralogues in humans, the two do not act redundantly. instead, each of the isoforms has a distinct effect on cell shape, implying divergence of functions. knockdown of several proteins increases stress fibres and inhibits cell migration, consistent with other data indicating an inverse correlation between stress fibre levels and migration speed  <cit> . other proteins that regulate migration speed act through changes in the shape and size of cell protrusions such as lamellipodia, which is known to alter migration efficiency  <cit> . these data support our approach as an effective strategy by which to identify new regulators of cytoskeletal organisation and cell migration. combining the morphological information with bioinformatic analysis has allowed us to identify new links between cell shape and genes previously implicated in a variety of human diseases, including huntington's disease, wilm's tumour, mental retardation, and down syndrome.
