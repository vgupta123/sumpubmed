BACKGROUND
heterosis is the phenomenon in which f <dig> hybrids exhibit phenotypes that are superior to their parents  <cit> . plant breeders have utilized heterosis for the development of superior yielding varieties in many important crop species without fully understanding the molecular basis of heterosis. researchers frequently discuss the magnitude of yield heterosis for a particular hybrid. in maize, the different inbred lines have been divided into "heterotic groups" based upon the level of grain yield heterosis  <cit> . generally, crosses within heterotic groups have lower grain yield heterosis than crosses between groups. however, heterotic groups are used as a general tool and not as a precise predictor of heterotic response  <cit> . there is a correlation between grain yield heterosis and genetic diversity such that increasing genetic diversity produces increasing level of grain yield heterosis  <cit> . however, when the parents become highly diverse this relationship is no longer observed  <cit> .

although heterosis in crop plants is most commonly discussed in terms of yield, numerous other phenotypic traits also display heterosis. maize exhibits high levels of heterosis for many traits such as root growth, height, ear node, leaf width, seedling biomass and other traits  <cit> . within a given hybrid, the amount of heterosis can vary widely for different traits  <cit> .

while it is widely agreed that parental genetic diversity serves as the basis of heterosis, the specific aspects of genetic diversity and how these contribute to heterotic phenotypes remains to be determined. the molecular mechanism driving heterotic phenotypes remains a subject of wide interest and debate  <cit> . the availability of high-throughput gene expression profiling technologies has allowed researchers to study the gene expression profile of hybrid plants relative to the inbred parents  <cit> . in general, most of these studies have focused on characterizing gene expression patterns in a single heterotic hybrid compared to the two parents. many of these studies have addressed similar topics regarding gene expression and heterosis, such as the relative frequencies of additive and non-additive expression levels in the hybrid. additive expression occurs when the hybrid expression level is equivalent to the mid-parent values while non-additive expression occurs whenever the hybrid expression level deviates from the mid-parent level . it is worth noting that non-additive expression phenotypes can include expression levels between the mid-parent and parental values, expression levels equivalent to one of the parents or expression levels outside the parental range. the identity and frequency of genes exhibiting hybrid gene expression levels outside of the parental range have been of particular interest in these studies.

the hybrid expression profiling studies have utilized a variety of expression profiling platforms, experimental designs and tissues. several studies have found that the majority  of genes exhibit additive expression in the hybrid and that only small numbers of the non-additively expressed genes exhibit expression levels outside the parental range  <cit> . other studies have found much higher levels of non-additive expression and numerous examples of expression outside the parental range  <cit> . it is unclear whether these differences are caused by biological differences between tissues, genotypes, or differences in the expression profiling platforms.

in this study we have investigated the heterosis and gene expression profiles for a set of maize hybrids with varying levels of parental genetic diversity. in addition, gene expression profiling was performed using several different technologies enabling the assessment of whether hybrids that generally exhibit lower levels of heterosis exhibit lower levels of non-additive expression or expression levels outside the parental range.

RESULTS
different maize hybrids show a range of heterotic responses that vary among traits
the primary objective of this study was to identify, and compare levels of, non-additive gene expression in several maize hybrids with varying levels of heterosis. there is a substantial amount of prior research on the levels of heterosis for grain yield in various maize hybrids. however, our expression profiling was performed with seedling tissue and this tissue may not be directly related to grain yield phenotypes. therefore, we monitored maize inbreds and hybrids to assess the levels of better parent heterosis  for five different phenotypes, including two different seedling phenotypes. bph is represented as the percent phenotypic increase in the hybrid relative to the better parent phenotype . our goal was to identify whether the levels of heterosis for different hybrid genotypes were correlated among a variety of traits, thus allowing us to determine which hybrids exhibit higher or lower "overall" heterosis.

we measured the mature plant height, 50-seed weight, days to flowering, seedling plant height and seedling biomass bph levels for a series of hybrids. the inbred lines b <dig> or mo <dig> were used as paternal parents in all hybrids studied. the phenotypic values for each replicate of all five traits are provided in additional file  <dig> and the bph values are available in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  the relative bph levels were quite variable among the different traits . for example, oh <dig> × b <dig> exhibited the highest bph for seed weight, but the fifth lowest bph for days to flowering . we tested whether there was a correlation in the level of bph among hybrids for any two traits . seedling height and seedling biomass exhibited a strong correlation  while plant height and days to flowering exhibited a weaker, but significant, correlation . the other eight trait comparisons did not show significant correlations. thus, in general, the level of bph heterosis for one trait is a poor predictor of the level of heterosis for another trait.

we assessed whether the concept of heterotic groups, which was developed as a tool to enable breeding for grain yield  <cit> , would predict heterosis levels for other traits. the concept of heterotic groups predicts that crosses within a heterotic group will generally exhibit less heterosis than crosses between heterotic groups. for all five traits we monitored, there were multiple intra-heterotic group crosses that exhibited higher levels of heterosis than several of the inter-heterotic group hybrids. for example, while b <dig> × b <dig> is an intra-heterotic group cross it displayed heterosis levels among traits that were similar to, and sometimes superior to, inter-heterotic group hybrids made between more distant parental genotypes . it is worth noting that heterotic groups are not entirely defined based upon heterosis but are often influenced by relatedness and other factors  <cit> .

we investigated the correlation between the levels of bph and the genetic distance  between the parent lines for each of the five traits. four out of the five traits exhibited positive correlation values, however only seedling biomass was statistically significant . the days to flowering phenotype exhibited a non-significant negative correlation. the hybrid line with the lowest parental genetic diversity, b <dig> × b <dig>  consistently exhibited low levels of relative bph . however, the lines with moderate to high levels of parental genetic diversity did not consistently show a strong correlation between heterosis levels and genetic distance.

a set of six hybrid genotypes were used for gene expression profiling. these hybrids represent intra- and inter-heterotic group crosses with a range of low to high genetic diversity between the parents and exhibit a substantial range of bph phenotypes . hybrids b <dig> × b <dig> and b <dig> × b <dig> represent crosses made between members of the stiff stalk synthetic heterotic group and the oh <dig> × mo <dig> hybrid is a cross between non-stiff stalk inbred lines. the other three crosses  represent hybrids derived by crossing parents from the two heterotic groups. these hybrids represent a range of genetic diversity . the b84-b <dig> parents have a relatively low level of genetic diversity while the b37-b <dig> parents encompass a moderate level of genetic diversity. the other hybrids, b73-mo <dig>  oh43-b <dig> and oh43-mo <dig>  all have higher levels of genetic diversity  <cit>  .

identification of differentially expressed genes
total rna was isolated from above ground 11-day seedling tissues for hybrids b <dig> × b <dig>  b <dig> × b <dig>  oh <dig> × b <dig>  oh <dig> × mo <dig> and their respective inbred parental lines. rna samples were collected for three biological replications and were processed for microarray analyses using the affymetrix maize  <dig> k genechip platform. the  <dig> k maize affymetrix array contains  <dig>  probe sets that are designed to detect the expression of  <dig>  genes. some genes are represented by multiple probes sets designed to detect sense and anti-sense expression or the expression of alternative transcripts. previously obtained affymetrix microarray data for 11-day seedlings from genotypes b <dig>  mo <dig>  b <dig> × mo <dig> and mo <dig> × b <dig>  <cit>  were included in downstream analyses for comparative purposes. a comparison of the expression profile of the inbred lines, b <dig> and mo <dig>  indicated that the profiles obtained in both experiments are quite comparable.

genes that were differentially expressed  among genotypes were identified within each inbred-hybrid group, based on an anova fdr <  <dig>  . the numbers of de genes were variable among the inbred-hybrid groups . there was a strong correlation between the number of de genes and the level of genetic distance between the parents . the comparison between inbred b <dig>  inbred b <dig> and hybrid b <dig> × b <dig> identified  <dig> de genes, by far the lowest number of any group. the comparison between inbred b <dig>  inbred b <dig> and hybrid b <dig> × b <dig> identified  <dig> de genes, and the remaining comparisons generated between 885– <dig> de genes .

the use of microarray expression profiling for intraspecific comparisons can be complicated by the presence of sequence polymorphisms within different inbred lines  <cit> . we assessed the frequency of false-positive de genes in our affymetrix dataset by validating the microarray data using two independent methodologies. first, the sequenom massarray platform was used to validate calls of differential expression between different inbred lines. we had previously used the massarray platform to measure allele-specific expression levels for a set of ~ <dig> genes using the same rna samples as were used in the affymetrix analyses  <cit> . the massarray platform can detect the relative allelic proportions for a given gene in a mix of parental rnas. the relative proportion detected for each allele can be compared with the proportion predicted based on the affymetrix data, as was demonstrated in stupar and springer  <cit> . fifty-six genes that were de in the affymetrix data were subjected to massarray validation . the correlation between the affymetrix and massarray data was strong, with  <dig> of the  <dig> examples showing similar directionality of biased expression in both platforms . a statistical analysis indicated that 74%  of the genes exhibit significant differential expression in the massarray dataset. second, we utilized a maize 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray platform  <cit>  to validate the de genes observed in the affymetrix dataset. the same sets of rna samples were labelled and hybridized to the 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray containing ~ <dig>  features. we identified a set of  <dig>  features on this platform that are expected to detect the same transcripts as the affymetrix platform. for all affymetrix de genes that are present on the 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray we compared the log <dig> expression differences between parental inbred lines on both platforms . pearson r values indicated significant correlations  for all of the comparisons . the 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray platform confirmed the directionality of the expression differences between parental inbred genotypes for the vast majority of the genes identified by affymetrix . while there are some examples in which differential expression is only detected using one of the platforms, the majority of genes exhibited similar differential expression in both microarray platforms. both the sequenom massarray and 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray analyses indicate that the majority of the de profiles identified using the affymetrix microarrays were valid.

assessment of hybrid expression additivity
we compared the levels of additive and non-additive expression in this series of six hybrid genotypes. an initial visual assessment using clustered heat map expression profiles indicated that the six hybrids were exhibiting additive or near-additive expression levels compared to the respective parental genotypes . to assess the proportions of statistically additive and non-additive expression patterns in the hybrids, we conducted t-tests of the hybrid expression values versus the inbred mid-parent values for all de genes. a substantial proportion of the de genes exhibited non-additive expression patterns, however, the proportions were very similar among the six different hybrids . no obvious trend was identified between parental genetic diversity and non-additive expression. in fact, the hybrid with the least amount of genetic diversity, b <dig> × b <dig>  exhibited the greatest  proportion of non-additive genes relative to the other hybrids.

we proceeded to assess the specific classes of non-additive expression that were exhibited in these maize hybrids. a non-additive gene could exhibit expression levels that are statistically between the mid-parent and high or low parental values , expression levels equivalent to the high parent  or low parental  values, or at levels above high parent  or below low parent  . we assessed the number of parent-like , ahp and blp hybrid expression patterns within the subset of non-additively expressed genes in each of the six hybrids . expression profiles were assigned to the parent-like category whenever hybrid expression levels were not significantly different from either the high or low parent . expression profiles were assigned to the ahp or blp categories whenever hybrid expression levels were significantly above the high parent or below the low parent, respectively . the remaining genes with non-additive expression exhibited between parent non-additive expression levels. very few genes  were ahp or blp using these criteria. a larger fraction of the non-additively expressed genes  exhibited parental-like expression levels. the majority  of the non-additively expressed genes exhibited between parent non-additive expression levels, such that the hybrids expressed these genes at levels that are between the two parents but are statistically different from the mid-parent and parental levels. an assessment of ahp and blp patterns applying more liberal criteria are presented below in section hybrid expression patterns outside of the parental range.

in addition to using statistical tests to determine the types and frequencies of non-additive expression, we also utilized a variety of plots using d/a values to visualize the distribution of hybrid expression values relative to the parental expression levels. in our application of the d/a calculation , a d/a value of zero indicated additive hybrid expression, d/a values of  <dig> or - <dig> indicated hybrid expression levels equal to one of the parents, and d/a values >  <dig> or <- <dig> indicated hybrid expression levels outside of the parental range.

we performed the d/a calculations in two different ways . the first d/a calculation  assesses the hybrid expression levels relative to the high parent and low parent for each gene. the second d/a calculation  assesses the hybrid expression levels relative to the maternal parent and paternal parent, allowing for the identification of maternal or paternal effects on gene expression in the hybrid. the distributions of the d/a values for the six different inbred-hybrid groups were strikingly similar . the d/a type i distribution for all six hybrids is centered at approximately zero, and the distribution tails consistently flattened within the parental range  . we did note that the center of the d/a type i distribution is skewed slightly towards the low parent. we suspected that the slight deviation of d/a type i values from the mid-parent levels may be caused by technical rather than biological factors. we found that genes with lower expression signals exhibited greater deviation from zero than genes with high expression signals . the d/a type i distribution for genes with at least one genotype signal >  <dig> units exhibited no deviation from zero for all six hybrids . these findings suggest that technical factors, such as a slightly non-linear dynamic range among the lower microarray signal intensities, may be causing the slightly skewed distributions.

similar to the d/a type i findings, the d/a type ii distributions also displayed a remarkably consistent distribution among the six hybrids patterns, as they each peaked at approximately zero and the tails flattened within the parental range . there is no evidence for skewing of the d/a type ii distribution, indicating that hybrid expression did not consistently favor the maternal or paternal parent. a previous study had noted an intriguing transcriptional parental effect in which the hybrid tissues collected from the immature ears of  <dig> different hybrids generally exhibited paternal-like expression patterns for genes that were more highly expressed in the maternal versus the paternal parent  <cit> . genes that were more highly expressed in the paternal parent tended to exhibit mid-parent expression patterns in the hybrids  <cit> . we attempted to replicate the guo et al.  <cit>  analysis using the 'd/a type ii' calculation on our affymetrix dataset . no such unidirectional skewing was observed in our dataset; the two gene subsets were equally skewed towards the respective low parent levels, which is simply a reflection of the low-parent skewing observed in figure 6a. it is possible that the explanation for the differences between these two studies is because of the different tissues used, immature ears  <cit>  versus seedlings .

the d/a type ii distribution for the subset of non-additive genes exhibited a bi-modal distribution, with the trough located around the additive d/a value of zero . the distribution indicated that most non-additively expressed genes exhibited hybrid expression values between the parental levels, with only a small proportion of genes found outside of the d/a parental range of - <dig>  to  <dig>  . this distribution confirms the conclusions based on statistical tests described above.

we also identified de genes and calculated d/a type i values using the 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray data . the distribution of the d/a plots from 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray data are very similar to the plots generated from the affymetrix data . the d/a type i distribution for all four hybrids are similarly shaped, with each centered near zero . however, the 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray d/a plots indicated that a substantial proportion of genes have hybrid expression levels outside of the parental range. this is evidenced by the fact that many of the genes exhibit d/a type i values greater than  <dig>  or less than - <dig>  . in total,  <dig> % of the de patterns exhibited d/a values outside the parental range in the 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray data. by comparison, the affymetrix d/a distributions were nearly flat outside of these values and only  <dig> % of the de patterns exhibited d/a values outside the parental range .

it is not clear why the two microarray platforms exhibited differences in the fraction of genes with d/a values outside the parental range. we considered the possibility that the different sets of genes represented on either platform may result in different rates of non-additive profiles. to address this, we generated a d/a plot  of the 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray data using only the de features that are also represented on the affymetrix platform . the resulting d/a distribution is very similar to the d/a distribution generated by all de genes , indicating that platform feature biases are not causing the differences in non-additive profiles observed between the microarray platforms.

it is important to remember that these d/a values are a composite of multiple biological replicates and they do not include estimates of variation. a closer inspection of several genes with d/a values above  <dig>  or below - <dig>  revealed that while the average d/a values are outside the parental range, they are often not statistically significant. we estimated the degree of variation within each platform by comparing the signal intensity variation among the biological replicates within each genotype. for each de gene, we divided the standard deviation of the three biological replicates by the mean of the three biological replicates. these calculations indicated that the 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray data generated approximately twice as much signal variation among replicates than the affymetrix platform . this higher level of signal variation likely contributes to the wider distributions of d/a values observed in figure  <dig> 

overall, the affymetrix data d/a plots indicated that the hybrid expression distributions were similar for all six hybrids, with peaks at approximately zero and very few genes exhibiting hybrid expression patterns outside of the parental range  . this is in strong agreement with the clustered heat maps  and statistical analyses of additivity . in general, the hybrids exhibited additive expression and the majority of genes with non-additive expression still exhibited expression levels within the parental range.

hybrid expression patterns outside of the parental range
the analyses of affymetrix microarray data described in the previous section applied relatively stringent statistical significance parameters. the affymetrix results identified  <dig> de patterns among the parents and hybrids of six crosses, however only  <dig> hybrid gene expression patterns were found to be significantly outside of the parental ranges. several other groups have reported observing much higher frequencies of hybrid expression outside the parental range  <cit> . in this section, we have applied more liberal statistical significance and fold-change thresholds to the affymetrix data in order to identify hybrid expression patterns outside of the parental range that may have been missed when applying the stringent statistical criteria.

the number of de genes was substantially increased when applying an anova fdr <  <dig>  . this identified a total of  <dig>  de patterns among the six hybrids . we then determined the number of patterns that exhibited expression above  or below  the parental range. only  <dig> % of all de patterns exhibited expression levels outside the parental range. of the  <dig> examples of expression outside the parental range, only  <dig> patterns are statistically different from the near-parent levels . these  <dig> patterns represent  <dig> genes . the majority of these genes showed less than  <dig> -fold differences from the near-parent, and successively higher fold-change stringency thresholds rapidly filtered the remaining genes; only nine genes showed greater than 2-fold changes outside of the parental range . these data indicate that for the vast majority of ahp and blp genes, the expression divergence from near-parent levels is relatively small. several methods were used to validate these ahp and blp expression patterns. we began by comparing the d/a values for these  <dig> examples of ahp or blp expression in the affymetrix data to the d/a values for these genes in the 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray data . the 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray data supported ahp or blp expression for  <dig> of the  <dig> genes  with available data. thus, the 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray data validated some of the examples of ahp or blp expression, but also indicated that some of these profiles may be false-positives. quantitative real-time pcr analyses validated the ahp or blp expression for six of eight of the genes tested  . we also noted that many of the  <dig> ahp or blp genes tend to exhibit low levels of ahp or blp expression in multiple hybrids, suggesting potential conservation of the ahp or blp patterns . our results indicate that a small fraction of genes display significant ahp and blp expression in hybrid maize seedlings. furthermore, comparisons of the different inbred-hybrid combinations provide evidence that many of these genes are consistently expressed outside of the parental range across different hybrid lines.

gene ontology analyses
we compared the relative representation of gene ontology  categories for the de genes versus the total number of probe sets present on the affymetrix microarray. for this analysis, the de genes from the stringent affymetrix analysis  were combined from the six inbred-hybrid groups. we did not identify any substantial divergence or overrepresentation of any specific go annotation in the de genes . we also tested the full set of genes with additive or non-additive expression and did not find enrichment for any go annotations within these lists of genes . the relative proportion of each category approximately matched the proportion present on the microarray, suggesting that differential expression and additivity occur at equal rates for all functional types of genes.

we also compared the go representation for the ahp and blp genes versus the total number of probe sets present on the affymetrix microarray. in this case, we did identify some obvious over- and under-represented categories . most obviously, the ahp genes appeared to be over-represented by electron transport and energy pathway processes, plastid and ribosome components, and structural molecular functions. the ahp genes were under-represented in nucleus components and several molecular function categories, including transcription factor activities. generally, the blp genes exhibited less frequent over- or under-representations than the ahp genes. over-represented blp categories included hydrolase and transferase molecular functions.

the biological meaning of the over- and under-represented ahp and blp categories remains unclear. the function of these gene classes may be particularly important in conferring heterosis. however, because the number of ahp and blp genes is relatively small , frequency analyses of these genes are more susceptible to sampling and stochastic effects.

discussion
linking maize genetic diversity and transcriptional variation
it is especially important to recognize that genetic and transcriptional assessments of natural variation apply different experimental procedures and analysis tools. sequence-based genetic diversity studies utilize a stable character for scoring variation, typically dna sequence polymorphisms. studying transcriptional diversity involves measuring an unstable unit, mrna, that is subject to change based on developmental and environmental cues. multiple sources of variation in gene expression datasets may increase the measurement variance among replicates, thereby reducing statistical power.

in the present study, we compared the transcriptional diversity of six different maize inbred-hybrid combinations. we found that the number of de genes identified for each inbred-hybrid group strongly correlated with the genetic diversity between inbred lines, as estimated by snp-based sequence analyses  <cit> . a comparison of the number of de genes for each of the  <dig> possible pairs of inbred genotypes also revealed a strong correlation between transcriptional and genetic diversity . our previous work using allele-specific expression assays indicated that maize intraspecific transcriptional variation is primarily driven by cis-acting sources of variation  <cit> . it is possible that increased levels of sequence polymorphism linked to genes may be at least partially responsible for the higher rates of transcriptional variation observed in more genetically distant inbreds. indeed, the intergenic space in the maize genome is known to be highly polymorphic among inbred lines  <cit> , and these structural and nucleotide polymorphisms may drive transcriptional variation of certain maize genes.

implications of non-additive expression patterns
we were also interested in identifying possible links between transcriptional profiles and heterotic performance. a higher number of differentially expressed genes were identified in the inbred-hybrid combinations representing more distantly related genotypes. the hybrids derived from more genetically diverse inbred parents exhibited higher numbers of both additive and non-additive gene expression patterns. however, the proportion of non-additive hybrid expression profiles among the de genes was similar for all six hybrids. additionally, the relative proportions of genes that display different types of non-additive expression were similar in the six hybrids. these data suggest that the prevalence of non-additive expression in seedling tissue is not correlated with different heterosis levels.

it is tempting to infer that non-additive hybrid expression patterns imply novel hybrid regulation or may be associated with heterosis. however, it is important to consider that non-additive expression patterns include both predictable and unpredictable patterns. using the "expression level" as a phenotype, we can describe non-additive expression patterns using dominance terminology. the genes with between-parent non-additive expression can be described as partially dominant while genes with hp or lp expression can be described as dominant. classical genetics provides many examples of partial or complete dominance in an f <dig> hybrid and in many cases the molecular mechanisms for this type of inheritance have been determined. in our study, even when we applied liberal statistical criteria for de gene identification, > 98% of the non-additively expressed genes exhibited expression phenotypes that could be described as partial or complete dominance.

many studies of intraspecific f <dig> hybrid gene expression have focused upon the identification of genes with expression levels outside the parental range, including studies in drosophila  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit>  and oyster  <cit> , among others. such patterns  have often been described as over- or under-dominant. these are unpredictable hybrid expression patterns and may be caused by novel hybrid-specific regulatory mechanisms. the importance of ahp or blp expression patterns in heterosis is unclear. it is possible that the ahp or blp expression patterns may play a role in driving heterosis. however, it is also possible that the ahp or blp expression patterns are a consequence, not a cause, of heterosis.

the previous study by swanson-wagner et al.  <cit>  had documented evidence that while additive expression was most common, all potential modes of hybrid gene expression were observed in the b <dig> × mo <dig> hybrid. in this study we report similar findings and extend this analysis to additional hybrids that exhibit different levels of genetic diversity. the number of ahp or blp genes reported in maize hybrid expression profiles has varied widely from essentially none  <cit>  to a small proportion of genes  <cit>  to a larger proportion of genes  <cit>  and even up to > 50% of de genes  <cit> . there are several potential explanations for this discrepancy. it could be that different tissues or developmental stages exhibit different levels of ahp and blp expression. alternatively, it could be that different expression profiling technologies, sampling methodologies or experimental designs influence the discovery of ahp and blp expression patterns, as described by cui et al.  <cit>  and rottscheidt and harr  <cit> . indeed, using the same rna samples across platforms, we found substantially more ahp and blp patterns on the 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray platform than on the affymetrix platform. however, real-time pcr rarely validated the 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray ahp and blp patterns , but more frequently validated the affymetrix ahp and blp patterns . if we assume that ahp and blp expression patterns are quite rare, then greater degrees of technical variation in an expression profiling platform may lead to higher numbers of false-positive ahp or blp observations.

complications in predicting heterosis
in this study, we investigated the heterotic responses of  <dig> different maize f <dig> hybrids across five different traits, plant height, days to flowering, seed weight, seedling height and seedling biomass. our goal was to ascertain whether heterosis for any particular trait was predictive of heterosis for another trait. furthermore, we wanted to observe the relationship between heterosis and parental genetic distance for each trait.

a major goal of this study was to compare the types of expression variation observed in hybrids with differing levels of heterosis. in order to perform this experiment we wanted to ascertain whether certain hybrids would show higher or lower levels of heterosis for a variety of traits. however, we found that there is generally a lack of correlation for heterosis levels among different traits. few hybrids appeared to consistently exhibit either high or low relative heterosis among traits. this suggests that heterosis is not an organism wide phenomenon but instead is trait-specific, and is likely controlled by partially non-redundant sets of genes for different traits.

previous studies have found that genetic distance between inbred parents is correlated with grain yield heterosis in maize when the parental lines are closely related but that this correlation breaks down when the parental lines are distantly related  <cit> . our analysis of non-yield traits in a relatively small number of hybrid genotypes concurs with the previous studies on the correlation between yield heterosis and genetic distant. we found that genetic distance was an inconsistent predictor of heterosis. only one of five traits  was found to have a significant correlation between genetic distance and heterosis. in general, hybrids derived from closely related parents had relatively low levels of heterosis. however, hybrids derived from distantly related parents displayed a range of heterotic responses, including high and low bph values. as in studies of yield heterosis, this means that genetic distance can often be used to predict poorly performing hybrids but has weak power to predict superior hybrids. hamblin et al.  <cit>  suggested that the difficulty in predicting hybrid performance for more distantly related parents may be due in part to difficulties in accurately assessing genetic distance for more distantly related inbreds.

CONCLUSIONS
this study indicates that there is a strong correlation between genetic diversity and transcriptional variation among maize inbreds. however, the degree of genetic or transcriptional variation between the inbred parents appears to be an inconsistent predictor of hybrid heterosis, depending on the trait of interest. the frequency and patterns of non-additive hybrid expression profiles appear to be similar among different hybrids. together, these data suggest that maize hybrid heterosis may be more influenced by the additive complementation of transcriptional variation than by novel non-additive expression states.
