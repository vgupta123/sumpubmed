BACKGROUND
venom from social hymenoptera  is used as an effective and important chemical weapon for the defense of individuals or of the colony. this can be achieved by injection of very low concentrations of venom into an enemy that reaches its bloodstream in a few minutes  <cit> . honeybee  venom is now known to contain  <dig> proteins that are recognized as allergens in humans by the international union of immunological societies  <cit> . the allergic response to these proteins in a sting victim varies from swelling, redness, pain, itching around the sting site, and potentially life-threatening allergic effects, including anaphylactic shock  <cit> . the biochemical composition of honeybee venom has been reported to have a wide array of biomolecules, such as biogenic amines, peptides and proteins  <cit> . in addition, honeybee venom has been well documented for pharmaceutical purposes in treatment of pathological conditions such as arthritis, neurodynia, rheumatism, skin diseases, and cancerous tumors  <cit> . recently, it has been discovered that melittin-loaded nanoparticles can attenuate hiv- <dig> infectivity, demonstrating the promising potential of bee venom for treatment of hiv  <cit> . currently, several pharmaceutical formulations using crude honeybee venom have been registered and are available on the european and global markets, such as forapin, germany; virapin, slovakia; apiven, france; melivenon, bulgaria; and apifor, russia  <cit> .

because bee venom is a human toxin, a comprehensive characterization of its molecular composition, side effects, and toxicology is of paramount importance for the development safe pharmaceutical formulations to satisfy human demand. to further this goal, honeybee venom has been intensively examined in the past  <cit> . due to its highly complex nature, bee venom has not been fully characterized by previous methods. recently developed techniques, namely mass spectrometry , have highly improved resolution and sensitivity, allowing the identification of thousands of proteins or peptides using a tiny amount of protein sample in a single run. a comprehensive profiling of honeybee venom has been achieved since  <dig> using this robust ms platform  <cit> . although the venom proteome of the honeybee has been significantly extended, previous studies have been performed using a singular proteomics approach such as either two dimensional electrophoresis  or an ms run . using only one technique may result in an underestimate of the proteome; 2-de based proteomics may exclude proteins with extreme molecular weights   <cit> , while ms-based proteomics can mask the low abundance proteins  <cit> . however, a combination of gel-based and gel-free proteomics has proven to be an efficient protocol to increase proteome coverage of a biological sample  <cit> .

at present, there are two traditional ways to collect honeybee venom: electrical stimulation  or manual  venom extraction directly from venom glands   <cit> . while esv can extract venom without the need to sacrifice any bees, gv extraction is at expense of the honeybee’s life. it is empirically recognized that gv contains more biochemical components, and it has thus been assumed it provides a more abundant potent bioactive source  <cit>  than esv. to address this hypothesis, the proteomes of gv and esv were compared qualitatively and quantitatively. a better knowledge of their proteins will aid in the selection of more appropriate forms of honeybee venom to be used as a pharmacological source.

venom toxins are secretory proteins that undergo a series of post-translational modifications  once released from the venom glands of the honeybee, such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, and sulfation  <cit> . ptms play a potential role in influencing ige binding capacity  <cit>  and protein immunogenicity and antigenicity  <cit> . phosphorylation is one of the most important ptms  <cit> . phosphorylation of snake venom has the potential to alter proteolytic activity, coagulability, and neurotoxicity of proteins  <cit> . in honeybee venom, very few proteins, such as mellitin and icarapin, are known to be phosphorylated  <cit> , and phosphorylation is not well characterized.

in this work we aim to better characterize honeybee venom by examining the proteomic differences of venom resulting from two different extraction techniques. by using more comprehensive techniques, we can identify previously overlooked proteins, and better understand phosphorylation patterns in honeybee venom.

RESULTS
1-de analysis
more protein bands were detected in gv than in esv . a total of  <dig> proteins were identified in all  <dig> fractions, of which  <dig> were from gv and  <dig> were from esv . of the  <dig> total proteins,  <dig> proteins were commonly represented in the two forms of bee venom. notably, dehydrogenase/reductase sdr family member 11-like  was identified as novel in the honeybee venom. only five toxic proteins were found in significantly higher abundance in gv than in esv: api m  <dig>  api m  <dig>  api m  <dig>  vitellogenin and pla2-like. the other highly abundant proteins in gv were non-toxic, and were mainly associated with antioxidant activities, protein folding, and molecular transporters. in esv, however, all  <dig> highly abundant proteins were toxic: api m  <dig>  api m  <dig>  api m  <dig>  mrjp <dig>  mrjp <dig>  icarapin-like, hyaluronidase, and mcdp . the abundance of melittin, phospholipase a- <dig>  and apamin preproprotein showed no significant differences between the two forms of venom .

2-de analysis
2-de analysis resulted in  <dig> and  <dig> protein spots  resolved in gv and esv, respectively . of these,  <dig> of the  <dig> spots in gv and  <dig> of the  <dig> protein spots in esv altered their abundance . among those which showed a greater than  <dig> -fold abundance change,  <dig> of the  <dig> gv spots and  <dig> of the  <dig> esv spots were successfully identified corresponding to  <dig> non-redundant proteins in gv and esv . five non-redundant proteins were shared in the two forms of bee venom , and  <dig> other proteins were specifically expressed in gv , but none of these proteins were expressed only in esv. in esv,  <dig> venom toxins had a higher abundance , venom allergen acid phosphatase , icarapin-like, and phospholipase a- <dig>  . in gv, however, only two toxic proteins were abundant: venom serine carboxypeptidase  and arginine kinase. the other  <dig> specifically detected proteins in gv were involved in antioxidant systems, protein folding and molecular transporters, carbohydrate or energy metabolism . the remaining unidentified differential protein spots could be attributed to either their low abundance to produce enough spectra or that the search scores in the databases did not produce unambiguous results.

shotgun analysis
twenty proteins were identified in the shotgun analysis, of which  <dig> proteins were found in both gv and esv. five additional proteins were identified only in gv, and one protein was identified only in esv . noticeably, secapin, proactivator polypeptide, danj homolog subfamily b member 11-like and histone h2b.3-like were specifically identified in the shotgun approach.

abundance quantification showed that  <dig> venom toxins had higher abundance in esv than in gv: mcdp, pla <dig>  api m  <dig>  mrjp <dig> and  <dig>  api m  <dig>  hyaluronidase, icarapin-like, api m  <dig> and loc <dig>  vitellogenin  had higher abundance in gv than in esv . five others  showed no significant difference between gv and esv . similar to the above 1-de and 2-de analysis, proteins identified in gv were also associated with antioxidant activities, protein folding and molecular transporters .

in total,  <dig> non-redundant proteins were identified in the two forms of bee venom,  <dig> proteins were shared in gv and esv:  <dig> venom toxins and  <dig> non-toxins. in gv,  <dig> proteins were specifically expressed:  <dig> toxins and  <dig> non-toxins. in esv, only toxin mcd peptide was specifically expressed. generally,  <dig> proteins were identified in esv and  <dig> proteins were identified in gv, respectively .

all proteins are identified as apis mellifera origin. accession number is the unique number given to mark the entry of a protein in the database of ncbinr used to search against in mascot software. √ indicates the proteins identified by corresponding proteomics approaches such as 1-de, 2-de and shotgun. y and n indicate whether a protein is a secretory protein or not, which the evidence is given in source column.

of the  <dig> differentially expressed proteins between gv and esv ,  <dig> were more highly expressed in gv:  <dig> venom toxins and  <dig> other non-toxin proteins associated with antioxidant systems, carbohydrate or energy metabolism, protein folding and molecular transporters. in contrast,  <dig> proteins were more highly expressed in esv than gv:  <dig> venom toxins, and one non-toxin related protein. the three other venom toxins such as melittin, secapin, apamin had no significant difference between gv and esv.

phosphopeptide analysis
esv contained 82% of venom toxins based on the above analysis, and was, therefore used for the phosphorylation analysis of honeybee venom. currently, a total of  <dig> phosphopeptides corresponding to three venom toxins have been identified : icarapin-like precursor was phosphorylated at s <dig> and s205; phospholipase a- <dig> was phosphorylated at t <dig> and apamin preproprotein was phosphorylated at t <dig> 

protein name and mass of the identified proteins searched against the ncbinr database in  <dig> . modified site is the position of the initial and final amino acids of peptide in the protein sequence. phosphorylated amino acid is labeled with sp. site* is the position of the initial and final amino acids of the peptide in the protein sequence. no. of spectra means the number of the identified phosphopeptides’s mass spectra. z means the charge of identified phosphopeptide. the peptides are accepted when -10lgp >  <dig>  as well as fdr < <dig> %.

discussion
we used complementary proteomics approaches to gain insight into the proteome differences of honey bee venom extracted using two different methods  and to map the phosphorylation sites of the most common used form of venom for therapeutic purposes. of the  <dig> proteins identified in both gv and esv, most of venom toxins were in higher abundance in esv than in gv. the most abundant proteins detected in gv were mainly involved in protection of the venom gland from tissue damage or in supporting glandular development. this suggests that electrical stimulation could generate a more pure venom as its contamination with cellular proteins is much smaller than that of the manual method. this method is also convenient for commercial production and does not sacrifice the bees in the collection process. this is in sharp contrast with the manual milking of bee venom , in which the bee is sacrificed, and the venom is contaminated by non-toxin proteins that may leak from the gland tissue that is cut/disrupted during venom collection. this provides a new scientific basis for the use of esv as a potential pharmacological source over gv, taking into consideration both production efficiency and honeybee welfare. four novel phosphorylation sites identified in three venom proteins may be involved in specific elicitation of an immune response via recognition of antigenic determinants  <cit> . the identification of two novel venom proteins significantly extends our in-depth understanding of the biological nature of honeybee venom.

more recently, resende et al.   <cit>  has used a higher resolution of ms than our adopted ms for the profiling of bee venom, and identified many new proteins and three phosphorylation sites mapped to icarapin and melittin. using our gel-based and gel-free proteomics approaches, two novel proteins, sdr and histone h2b.3-like, were identified, and phosphorylation of phospholipase a- <dig>  apamin preproprotein and s <dig> in icarapin-like precursor were assigned as novel sites. this indicates that the combined gel-based and gel-free proteomics approaches are a robust protocol for the achievable identification of proteome and phosphoproteome of bee venom.

in order to effectively utilize venom in defense of their community, the honeybee using its venom inflicts the invader with the utmost suffering through systemic ige-mediated allergic reactions after insect stings. this could result in potentially life-threatening and sometimes fatal immune-mediated anaphylaxis. our study has identified all the  <dig> allergens  in the honeybee venom. melittin  is the major allergen responsible for intense local pain  <cit>  and can trigger the lysis of a wide range of cells  <cit> . phospholipase a- <dig>  is important for the specific ige induction in sting victims  <cit> . hyaluronidase  facilitates the diffusion of other venom constituents through the interstitial space  <cit> . api m  <dig>  5– <dig> are recognized as a strong ige and t-cell response to bee venom of the sting victim  <cit> . except for api m 7– <dig> and melittin, the higher abundance of all above allergens in esv are thought to be a survival strategy of the honeybee to effectively defend individuals and the colonies they live in  <cit> .

in addition, the identified other toxins, such as mcd peptide, venom serine carboxypeptidases, venom serine proteases, arginine kinase, apamin, and secapin, work as enhancers for a massive release of histamine  <cit> , degradation of insect neurotransmitters  <cit> , mediation of immunity-related processes  <cit> , phosphorylation of venom proteins  <cit> , and influencing the nervous system as a neurotoxic polypeptide  <cit> .

although honeybee venom is mainly physiologically effective for toxicological suffering in the sting victim, the reported pharmacological applications are mainly from the toxins. melittin and phospholipase a- <dig> have been reported to inhibit tumor cell proliferation and thus have potential value for the cure of cancer  <cit> , and the attenuation of hiv- <dig> infectivity  <cit> . hyaluronidase can be used as an anesthetic, analgesic, anti-cancer agent and also to help the spread of drugs in tissues  <cit> . dipeptidyl peptidase iv has functionally suppressed peritoneal dissemination and progression of ovarian carcinoma and inhibits malignant phenotypes of prostate cancer cells  <cit> . the mcd peptide has reported anti-inflammatory activity at higher concentrations, which can be used as a tool in studying secretory mechanisms of mast cells, basophils, and leukocytes  <cit> . most toxin proteins had either a higher abundance in esv  or were found in equal abundance in gv and esv . therefore, the utilization of esv as a potential pharmacological source is a more efficient and convenient choice as a valuable source for the future development of novel human therapeutics than that of gv  <cit> .

in gv, many non-venom toxic proteins were identified even though manually milking of the venom from the gland was performed carefully. the toxin component in the venom of manual collection has significantly lower content than venom from a honeybee’s natural sting. these non-venom toxic proteins were may mainly contaminated by leaking when gland tissues were damaged. they are involved in many pathways for the normal functionality of venom glands to secrete venom toxins and development, such as antioxidant systems, protein folding, molecular transporters, carbohydrate and energy metabolism. they might play an important role in protection of the secretory cells of the venom gland from the harmful damage of toxins  <cit> . although some of the proteins were identified as putative secretory proteins, we could not rule out that they are the remaining trace amounts of bee venom toxin, since the reported toxin accounts for >80% of venom content  <cit> , this requires further study to confirm if they are real toxin proteins in bee venom.

phosphorylation is a quite rapid biological reaction in quick response to external stimulus and internal signals. the phosphorylation site is recognized as an important allergenic epitope, and the allergenicity of the proteins is affected by a change in the epitope  <cit> . to fully exert the toxic power towards protecting the honeybee colony, the phosphorylation of venom toxin is probably to enhance the efficiency of local tissue damage, induction of death in other insects and pain, and allergy and inflammation in higher organisms  <cit> . to this effect, icarapin-like protein is suspected in evoking an immune response after a bee sting through protein phosphorylation  <cit> . phosphorylation of phospholipase a- <dig> may be responsible for increasing its lysis activity  <cit> . apamin is an important neurotoxic polypeptide, and its phosphorylation may participate in the modulation of ca2+-activated k+channel  <cit>  that acts on the central nervous system  <cit> . the mapped s <dig> in icarapin is the same as the report of ferreira resende   <cit> . the other assigned sites in phospholipase a- <dig> and apamin and s <dig> in icarapin-like precursor are novel.

CONCLUSIONS
using complementary gel-based and gel-free proteomic techniques, we have found that proteins in esv are mainly composed of toxin proteins and most of them are highly abundant. proteins identified in gv are mainly those which have been contaminated by the venom tissue damage during the milking process. esv is the better form to more efficiently utilize honeybee venom as a potential pharmacological source, in terms of obtaining it commercially and without the need to sacrifice each individual bee. the identification of two novel proteins and three phosphorylation sites on venom proteins provides key information to gain new insight into the biochemical properties of honeybee venom.
