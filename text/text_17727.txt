BACKGROUND
therian  mammals have a xx female/xy male sex chromosome system, or some simple variant of it. the x and y chromosomes evolved from an ordinary pair of autosomes via a process of gene loss on the y  <cit> , which resulted in an imbalance of x gene dosage with the autosomes  in males. it was proposed that to rebalance transcriptional output between the autosomes and the x chromosome, genes  on the single x in males were upregulated  <cit> . carry through of x chromosome upregulation to females would result in functional x tetrasomy , which was subsequently balanced by transcriptional silencing of one x in the somatic cells of females – called x chromosome inactivation   <cit> .

during early embryogenesis, in eutherian females, the x inactive specific transcript  is expressed from the x inactivation center  on the future inactive x chromosome . xist, a long non-coding rna , coats the x chromosome in cis and triggers a cascade of epigenetic events that stably represses transcription of most x loci  <cit>  . in human, genes in older regions of the x chromosome are more likely to be inactivated, whereas genes located in the evolutionarily younger regions of the x chromosome are more likely to be expressed from the xi   <cit> . the choice of which x chromosome  becomes inactivate is random  <cit> . although some properties of xci mechanism vary between species , the general epigenetic profile of the xi appears to be well conserved across eutherian mammals  <cit> .

eutherians diverged from the marsupial lineage ~ <dig> million years ago . the marsupial x is homologous to the long arm and proximal short arm of the human x . like eutherian mammals, one of the two xs in marsupials is inactivated  <cit> , and although some epigenetic features of the xi are conserved between clades  <cit> , there are also considerable differences  <cit> . the region homologous to the eutherian xic has been disrupted on the marsupial x chromosome  <cit>  and there is no xist homologue  <cit> . instead, the lncrna gene rsx  appears to be involved in marsupials xci  <cit> . like xist, the rsx transcript is exclusively expressed from the xi and coats it in cis  <cit> .

early studies of allozyme variants and somatic cell hybrids of four genes in different marsupial species  proposed that marsupial xci was incomplete and variable between tissues and species . additionally, the results showed that there was imprinted inactivation of the paternally derived x chromosome . a recent genome-wide study in opossum  fetal brain and extraembryonic tissues reported complete paternal inactivation for most  genes on the x chromosome, and escape from xci for 14% of genes  <cit> . this level of escape is comparable to that reported for the whole human x . however, it is higher than the level of escape on both the mouse x   <cit> , and the regions of the human x homologous to the marsupial x   <cit> .

comparison of xci between different tissues and species offers new insights to its mechanism and evolution. in this study we used rna-seq data from a captive bred tammar wallaby family , and genome sequencing from the father and the mother  <cit> , to determine the parent of origin of expressed alleles on the daughter’s x chromosome. we confirm paternal inactivation on the tammar wallaby x chromosome, but observed more escape from inactivation than previously reported for human, mouse and opossum.

RESULTS
imprinted inactivation of the paternal x chromosome in marsupials was hypothesised more than 20 years ago based on evidence from four genes in six different marsupial species  <cit> . consistent with this, a more recent study  <cit>  confirmed preferential paternal inactivation as a chromosome-wide phenomenon in opossum brain and extraembryonic tissues. here we analysed expression of x-linked genes in liver and blood from an australian marsupial, the tammar wallaby. we sequenced polyadenylated rna  from a father and mother blood sample, along with a liver sample from the daughter. to overcome the limitation of some alleles not being present in the mother transcriptome due to silencing via xci, we also used dna-sequencing data available from the father and the mother  <cit> .

mapping results and snp calling
an average of ~ <dig> million  reads were obtained for each of the three samples, of which approximately 26 m, 20 m and 30 m were uniquely mapped for father, mother and daughter respectively . in total  <dig>  snps were called between the wallaby reference genome and our three samples. 68% of snps were shared between the three individuals , so were non-informative when determining parent-of-origin of snps in the daughter. a total of  <dig> snps  called  against the reference genome were assigned to the x chromosome . snps that were associated with genes  that did not have a 1: <dig> orthologue in human and/or opossum, plus those that we were unable to anchor to the x chromosome, were not included in the analysis . some reported snps were located outside wallaby annotated genes and/or exons, likely due to the poor assembly and annotation of the tammar wallaby genome, and were still considered in the analysis.

assessing allele-specific expression
we calculated relative expression of each allele for heterozygous biallelically expressed snps in the daughter’s liver and the mother’s blood . in addition, we also included snps that were confidently called as heterozygous in daughter , but that were monoallelically expressed . as such, we could calculate relative expression of each allele for both biallelically and monoallelically expressed heterozygous snps.

we observed apparent biallelic expression from the x chromosome in the father, likely because y-derived reads from the male were reported as best mapped to the x chromosome. this is not surprising since a female individual was sequenced and y sequence is absent in the tammar wallaby genome assembly  <cit> . to date,  <dig> genes have been identified on the tammar wallaby y chromosome, almost all of which have an x-linked copy  <cit> . we identified  <dig> x genes with heterozygous snps in male including uba1x and atrx, both of which have a known copy on the wallaby y chromosome   <cit>  . the remaining genes on the x with apparent biallelic expression in males could represent unidentified homologies between the x and y in tammar wallaby, or multi copy genes on the x; these snps were all removed from the analysis.

snps were detected for  <dig> x-linked loci in daughter ; based on parental transcriptome and genome, as well as the daughter transcriptome, we could infer the daughter’s genotype and determine the parent-of-origin of for  <dig> snps in  <dig> loci . twenty-seven snps  had complete monoallelic expression, all of which were exclusively expressed from the maternal allele .

the remaining  <dig> snps  had biallelic expression and were considered escapers ; the proportion of escape from xci that we observed in wallaby was considerably higher than that previously reported for human , mouse  and opossum   <cit> . wang et al  <cit>  focused on heterozygous biallelically expressed snps, which could potentially underestimate the proportion of inactive loci because heterozygous snps expressed from a single allele would be overlooked. when analysing only heterozygous biallelically expressed snps on the x, we observed that all loci  escaped x inactivation in liver . in addition, we examined heterozygous biallelically expressed x-borne snps in the mother’s blood and observed that  <dig> out of  <dig> loci escaped inactivation . this frequency is much higher than the reported for opossum brain and extraembryonic tissues using equivalent methods .

average expression from the paternal allele of snps that escape xci was 46% , whereas in opossum expression from the paternal allele  is significantly lower than the maternal allele  for most escaper genes  <cit> . although different tissues were studied , this pronounced escape is likely a reflection of the relative “leakiness” of the tammar wallaby xci system, which was also observed in tammar wallaby cultured fibroblasts  <cit> .

generally, snps within the same gene or in nearby regions exhibited very similar allelic bias, with the exception of three snps mapped to scaffold28735: two snps  were biallelically expressed, and the nearby snp  ~ <dig>  kb down stream had paternal inactivation .

inactive status of annotated genes
to determine inactivation status for tammar wallaby x genes we examined only the snps within annotated genes. complete paternal inactivation was observed for ten genes  and unbiased biallelic expression for seven genes . snps in ebp, rps4x and vamp <dig> were validated as heterozygous in daughter by conventional sequencing .table  <dig>

finally, we attempted to determine parent of origin for expression of rsx  to better elucidate which x chromosome was inactivated. in daughter no biallelic expression  of rsx was observed, and because there was no coverage of rsx in either of the parental genomes the daughter’s genotype could not be inferred. genotyping   <dig>  kb of the non-repetitive regions of rsx in each individual revealed no heterozygous snps. it was, therefore, impossible to determine whether rsx had monoallelic expression from the paternal allele in the daughter.

our previous work, using rna-fish to conduct single-cell expression assays in tammar wallaby fibroblast nuclei, provided a similar result to this study where all loci tested escaped xci to some degree  <cit> . only two genes sampled in the present study were assayed previously: 1) mecp <dig> was expressed from both x chromosomes in 41% of female nuclei, and in the present study we observed nearly equal expression from the paternal and maternal alleles . and 2) hcfc <dig> was expressed from both x chromosomes in <10% nuclei , whereas in the present study it was expressed at 30% from paternal allele and 70% from the maternal allele . contrary to our findings, none of the genes studied in  <cit>  completely escaped xci , a discrepancy likely due to the different cell types studied.

inactivation does not correlate with location on the x in marsupials
biallelic expression ratios of close to 1: <dig> were observed along the length of the x chromosome with no apparent correlation between inactivation and locus location, or correlation with proximity to rsx . this is in stark contrast to human, where x-linked genes located in newer strata are more likely to escape inactivation than genes in the older strata. in the human xcr   <dig> of  <dig>  sampled genes escape inactivation  <cit> . this is significantly fewer  than the expected number of escapee genes  should the xcr have the same frequency of escape from inactivation as the whole x.figure  <dig>

two evolutionary strata were recently identified on the marsupial x , into which x-linked loci were binned when possible . we did not observe a correlation with escape from inactivation and location in either of the two marsupial x evolutionary strata  <cit> . seven of the  <dig> wallaby x loci sampled could be classified as members of the oldest x stratum, with three escaping xci. although the number of genes sampled in the old stratum was low, the frequency of escape remained similar to the frequency of escape on the whole x . likewise, of the three loci assigned to the newer tammar wallaby x stratum, two escaped inactivation.

after examination of previously published opossum x inactivation data  just five genes could be assigned to the newer stratum, of which four escaped inactivation. however,  <dig> genes with known xci status were placed in the oldest marsupial x stratum, of which five escaped xci. in contrast to the different inactivation levels between human x strata, the number of escapee genes in the opossum old x stratum was not statistically different  from the expected number of escapee genes .

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that chromosome wide inactivation of the paternally inherited x is common to both australian and american marsupials. also, in stark contrast to human where just  <dig> % of genes located in the two oldest x chromosome evolutionary strata escape inactivation and  <dig> % escape inactivation in the three youngest strata, we show that a higher probability of inactivation does not correlate with location in the oldest marsupial x stratum.
