BACKGROUND
the peach-potato aphid, myzus persicae is a globally important pest of a broad range of arable and horticultural crops principally due to its ability to transmit more than  <dig> plant viruses  <cit> . its control relies almost exclusively on the application of insecticides and, as a result, this species has developed multiple resistance to many chemical classes including organophosphates, carbamates and pyrethroids  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms of resistance to insecticides in m. persicae include overproduction of detoxifying carboxylesterases  which confers resistance primarily to organophosphates, and two forms of target-site resistance involving mutation of the acetylcholinesterase protein,  giving insensitivity to dimethyl carbamates, and of the voltage-gated sodium channel  giving resistance to pyrethroids  <cit> . neonicotinoids such as imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin and acetamiprid are unaffected by these mechanisms and are currently the main means of control. despite two decades of steadily increasing use neonicotinoids have proved remarkably resilient to the development of resistance and have remained highly effective against m. persicae. samples of m. persicae with reduced susceptibility to neonicotinoid compounds  have been found in europe, the usa and japan  <cit> . however, at present the levels of resistance described have limited practical significance as they are insufficient to impair the field effectiveness of these insecticides  <cit> .

recently, biochemical and genomic approaches were used to investigate neonicotinoid resistance in a m. persicae clone from greece showing ~ <dig> fold resistance to neonicotinoids  <cit> . resistance was associated with multiple duplications of a single p <dig> gene , with resistant aphids carrying ~ <dig> copies of the gene compared to the two copies found in susceptible aphids. however, ligand-binding and sequencing studies provided no evidence that structural modification of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor  contributed to resistance in this clone. although aphids have continued to be effectively controlled by neonicotinoids, resistance is a significant problem in other insect species including the colorado potato beetle , the brown planthopper  and the tobacco whitefly   <cit> . as found for m. persicae, overexpression of one or more p450s appears to be the primary mechanism of neonicotinoid resistance in insect pests  <cit> . the only alternative mechanism described to date was modification of the target-site in a laboratory-selected strain of n. lugens, when resistance was associated with a point mutation in two nachr alpha subunits   <cit> . however, resistance in field populations of n. lugens appears to occur exclusively via p450-mediated detoxification  <cit>  and, to date, no case of target-site insensitivity to neonicotinoids has been described in individuals of any insect pest collected directly from the field.

the selectivity of neonicotinoids for insects is thought to be due, at least in part, to their high affinity for insect nachrs  <cit> . nicotinic receptors are ligand-gated ion channels made up of five subunits arranged in combinations from a family of different subunit subtypes  <cit> . insect genomes sequenced to date have contained around ten genes encoding alternative nachr subunit subtypes and six genes have been characterised in m. persicae  <cit> .

we report here, for the first time, a clone of m. persicae with extremely potent resistance to neonicotinoids that compromises the field effectiveness of members of this insecticide class. we provide evidence that both p450-mediated detoxification of neonicotinoids and target-site insensitivity confer the resistance phenotype. this is the first example of field-evolved target-site resistance to neonicotinoid insecticides.

RESULTS
topical bioassays
a clone of m. persicae  originating from peach orchards in southern france exhibited potent resistance to imidacloprid and thiamethoxam when compared to a susceptible clone  in insecticide bioassays using two different methods of topical application . indeed, using a micro-application method , resistance was immeasurable due to insufficient mortality at the highest concentration that could be applied. a comparison of the resistance profile of frc with 5191a  using the same bioassay method  highlights the significantly enhanced level of resistance exhibited by frc. spray application bioassays, which combine direct contact with insecticide and subsequent exposure to residues on leaves, gave measurable resistance factors of 1679- and 225-fold to imidacloprid and thiamethoxam respectively. in the micro-application assays there was evidence that pre-treatment with the metabolic enzyme inhibitor piperonyl butoxide  synergised the effect of thiamethoxam  although high levels of resistance remained . the effect of pre-treatment with pbo was more evident in spray application bioassays, with resistance factors reduced to 234-fold for imidacloprid and 26-fold for thiamethoxam .

5191a was only tested by micro-application of insecticide.

imidacloprid metabolism
the metabolism of imidacloprid -n-nitroimidazolidin-2-ylideneamine) has been well characterised in mammals, plants, soil and some insect species  <cit> . whilst a range of primary metabolites have been identified, the major metabolic pathway identified in many species is hydroxylation and desaturation of the imidazolidine ring to form the hydroxy and olefin metabolites  <cit> . initial lc-ms/ms analysis investigating ten selected metabolites  revealed that the 4/5-hydroxy metabolite was the only metabolite detected in aphids treated with a topical application of imidacloprid. therefore, subsequent analysis focused on parent imidacloprid and the 4/5-hydroxy metabolite to determine whether there were differences in imidacloprid metabolism between frc and 4106a.

lc-ms/ms analysis did reveal significant differences in imidacloprid metabolism between frc and 4106a. for 4106a, recovery of imidacloprid increased in a time-dependent manner over the course of the experiment, reaching a maximum of  <dig>   ng mg- <dig> of aphids after  <dig> h , suggesting that the rate of imidacloprid uptake across the cuticle was greater than the rate of imidacloprid metabolism and excretion. in contrast, for frc the recovery of imidacloprid decreased in a time-dependent manner, reaching a minimum of  <dig>   ng mg- <dig> of aphids after  <dig> h . in terms of metabolite production, in clone 4106a recovery of the 4/5-hydroxy metabolite was variable, often being below the limit of detection and/or limit of quantification. however, in the frc clone, this metabolite was more consistently detected and was produced in a time-dependant manner, reaching a maximum  relative peak area/mg of aphid) after  <dig> h . although the 4/5-hydroxy metabolite has been shown to possess some insecticidal activity, its specific activity at the nachr is weaker than imidacloprid  <cit> .

microarray analysis
microarray analysis identified  <dig> genes significantly differentially transcribed between frc and 4106a. the full list of these genes along with log <dig>  calculated fold-change values and a description based on the closest blast hit is given in additional file  <dig>   <dig> genes  had elevated expression in frc and  <dig>  were under-transcribed in this clone relative to 4106a. of the  <dig> over-expressed genes with a known function,  <dig> were potential candidates for being involved in insecticide resistance and are listed in table  <dig>  these included genes encoding cytochrome p450s, carboxylesterase e4/fe <dig> and a glutathione-s-transferase.

five est sequences encoding carboxylesterase fe <dig> and the closely related variant e <dig> were identified as over-expressed in the resistant clone. however the level of expression was variable  probably because as reported previously only one of the five ests  is a perfect match with e4/fe <dig>  <cit> . it is likely that the fold-change indicated by hybridisation to the probe designed on contig  <dig> is the most accurate and this showed a ~290-fold over-expression.

five est sequences  corresponding to the m. persicae cytochrome p <dig> gene cyp6cy <dig> showed elevated expression in the frc clone . overexpression of this gene was reported previously to be associated with moderate levels  of resistance to neonicotinoids in the m. persicae clone 5191a . eleven additional est sequences encoding p450s were also overexpressed in the frc clone but the changes observed were relatively low . analyses of these sequences indicated that the  <dig> ests probably correspond to seven cytochrome p <dig> genes. two are most similar in sequence to the acyrthosiphon pisum p <dig> genes cyp380c <dig> , and cyp380c5v <dig>  that belong to the cyp <dig> clade. the remaining five genes are most similar to the a. pisum p <dig> genes, cyp6cy <dig> , cyp6cy <dig> , cyp6cy <dig> , cyp6cy <dig>  and cyp6cy <dig>  belonging to the cyp <dig> clade. finally, a single gst gene most similar in sequence to other insect gsts of the sigma class showed a moderate  increase in expression in frc compared to 4106a.

among the  <dig> genes of known function that were under-transcribed in frc relative to 4106a, a limited number of detoxification genes were identified . these included four sequences encoding gsts with a negative fold change of - <dig> to - <dig>  two sequences encoding cyp6-type cytochrome p450s and one sequence encoding a cyp4-type p <dig> with a fold change of - <dig> to - <dig> .

real-time quantitative pcr was used to validate microarray results by examining the expression profile of cyp6cy <dig> and the seven additional over-expressed p <dig> genes. expression was compared simultaneously between frc, 4106a and 5191a . in all cases the increased transcription of the genes was confirmed . as shown in additional file  <dig> the cyp6cy <dig> gene was over-transcribed in frc 28-fold compared to 4106a but this was not significantly different to the level of expression in 5191a. overexpression of this gene in 5191a was previously shown to be due, in part, to a 9-fold amplification of the structural gene  <cit> . quantitative pcr was therefore used to determine cyp6cy <dig> gene copy number in the frc clone using genomic dna as template and normalising data to the para gene present in two copies in diploid insect genomes. frc showed a fold change in copy number of  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  comparable to that in 5191a. of the remaining p <dig> genes, five  were found to be overexpressed in frc compared to both 4106a and 5191a although the fold-changes observed were low . the exception was the p <dig> gene represented by est  <dig> which showed a higher  level of overexpression. however, this gene was also overexpressed at a similar level in 5191a suggesting it is not involved in the enhanced resistance phenotype displayed by frc.

radioligand binding assays
radioligand binding assays of -imidacloprid to aphid membrane preparations revealed substantial differences in the nature of imidacloprid binding between frc and 4106a. as described previously, -imidacloprid recognised two sites in the susceptible 4106a clone, one of very high  affinity and a second lower  affinity site  <cit>  . in the frc clone the dual nature of -imidacloprid binding was absent with only a single lower affinity binding site present, as demonstrated by a hill value close to unity , resulting in an overall reduction in binding affinity. in addition, this single binding site was present at far greater concentrations than that observed for the -imidacloprid binding sites in 4106a indicated by the substantially increased bmax value in the frc clone. the kd values recorded in this study for wild-type m. persicae differ somewhat from those recorded previously   <cit> , however, there are some significant experimental differences between the two studies. firstly, in this study larger final incubation volumes  were used to avoid ligand depletion at very low concentrations of added -imidacloprid. secondly, two different wild-type strains were used, us1l by lind et al and 4106a in this study.

sequence analysis of m. persicae nachr subunit genes
the n-terminal region of the m. persicae nachr α1-α <dig> and β <dig> subunits, encompassing the conserved domains  that comprise the acetylcholine and neonicotinoid binding site were amplified by pcr from frc, 5191a, and 4106a and examined by nucleotide sequencing. although a limited number of silent snps were detected in the nucleotide sequence of the nachr α1-α <dig> subunits, no non-synonymous changes were observed and the deduced amino acid sequence in the region studied was identical between all clones. in contrast, when the sequence of the mpβ <dig> subunit was compared a non-synonymous snp was observed exclusive to frc that causes an amino acid replacement of arginine  to threonine  at amino acid position  <dig> within loop d, a predicted agonist binding site of nachr β subunits . additional sequencing of rt-pcr products derived from rna extracted from individuals confirmed that this mutation is homozygous in frc.

discussion
the neonicotinoids are the fastest growing class of insecticides in the global crop protection market with annual worldwide sales of over $ <dig>  billion  <cit> . they have remained effective against m. persicae because they circumvent the resistance mechanisms that have evolved to other insecticide classes, and have so far not been compromised by the evolution of novel mechanisms. in this study we have characterised a field-derived clone  of m. persicae exhibiting sufficiently high levels of neonicotinoid resistance to impair field performance of these insecticides. the involvement of p450-mediated detoxification in resistance was initially implicated by the use of pbo, an inhibitor of metabolic enzymes including p450s, which was found to alter the phenotype of the resistant clone. further evidence was provided by lc-ms/ms analysis of imidacloprid metabolism, which demonstrated that the 4/5-hydroxy-imidacloprid metabolite, a product of phase i reactions catalysed by microsomal p450s  <cit> , was produced at higher levels in frc than the susceptible clone . microarray and quantitative real-time pcr analyses showed that a cytochrome p <dig> gene cyp6cy <dig> was overexpressed in the frc clone 28-fold and this was due in part to an eight-fold amplification of the structural gene. amplification of this gene has been reported previously for m. persicae where it was associated with moderate  resistance to neonicotinoids in a clone from greece   <cit> . however, the levels of expression of this gene in frc and 5191a were not significantly different and are therefore unlikely to explain the significantly enhanced levels of resistance seen in the frc clone. a small number of additional p <dig> genes were found to be overexpressed in frc compared to both 4106a and 5191a. however, the level of overexpression was relatively low  fold and while it is possible the proteins encoded by these genes may play some role in resistance it is unlikely their overexpression explains the significantly enhanced level of resistance exhibited by frc compared to 5191a. the gene encoding carboxylesterase fe <dig> was also highly overexpressed  in frc but this is an established mechanism of resistance to other insecticides that has been shown to have no effect on neonicotinoids  <cit> .

bioassays also provided strong evidence of an additional major mechanism in resistance with a significant resistance factor remaining in the frc clone to both thiamethoxam and imidacloprid after synergism by pbo. to investigate the possibility of target-site insensitivity in resistance, the binding of -imidacloprid to membrane preparations of frc and 4106a was compared. previous binding studies with a range of insect species have demonstrated that while all insect species examined have a binding site for imidacloprid, hemipteran insects including m. persicae have two sites, one of very high affinity and a second of lower affinity  <cit> . this may account for the enhanced efficacy of imidacloprid against sap-feeding insects such as aphids, leafhoppers and planthoppers  <cit> . in a previous study no difference in the binding of -imidacloprid to membrane preparations from 5191a and 4106a was observed  <cit> . however, in this study we found the high affinity -imidacloprid binding site had been lost in frc and the remaining lower affinity site was altered, resulting in a substantial overall reduction in binding affinity. recent study of nachr subunits in the hemipteran n. lugens has suggested which subunits of the nachr contribute to the formation of the imidacloprid binding site  <cit> . this work has shown that the nlβ <dig> subunit is an absolute requirement for imidacloprid binding and that nachrs containing nlα <dig>  nlα <dig> and nlβ <dig> constitute the lower affinity site whereas nachrs containing nlα <dig>  nlα <dig> and nlβ <dig> constitute the higher affinity site  <cit> . to see if mutation of the orthologous nachr subunits was associated with resistance in frc the nucleotide sequence of the n-terminal  region of six nachr subunit  genes from frc, 4106a and 5191a was compared. no non-synonymous changes were observed between clones in any nachr α subunit. however, a single point mutation in the loop d region of the nachr β <dig> subunit of the frc clone was identified that causes an arginine to threonine substitution . loop d is one of three regions of the β <dig> subunit that in combination with loops a, b and c of α subunits form the acetylcholine binding site  <cit> . several lines of experimental evidence indicate that the amino acid at this position within loop d is a key determinant of neonicotinoid binding to nachrs. insect β <dig> receptors are highly conserved at this amino acid position and all insect species characterised to date have a positively charged arginine at this position . in contrast, vertebrate β subunits rarely have a positively charged amino acid at this position with the most common residue being a threonine . indeed, the high sensitivity of insect nachrs to neonicotinoids is thought to be due to interactions between the distinctive electronegative pharmacophore  of these insecticides and conserved residues upstream of loop b, within loop c of α subunits, and certain positively charged residues in loop d  of β subunits  <cit> . crystallization of molluscan ach-binding proteins, homologous to the amino-terminal ligand binding domain of nachr subunits, has confirmed that neonicotinoids bind to nachrs at the same site as acetylcholine and that amino acids at the corresponding position to r <dig> are in close proximal contact with imidacloprid  <cit> . the most compelling evidence that r81t reduces neonicotinoid binding comes from site-directed mutagenesis and homology modelling studies of vertebrate and insect recombinant receptors  <cit> . substituting the threonine residue in the chicken β <dig> subunit at position  <dig>  with arginine or another basic residue greatly enhanced the affinity of recombinant nachrs  for imidacloprid. however, this effect was only seen following an additional substitution of a nearby residue in the chicken β <dig> subunit  to mimic insect β <dig> subunits which, in contrast to vertebrate β subunits, have a valine at this position. models of the recombinant receptors indicated that the nitro group of imidacloprid interacts directly with the introduced basic residue at this position  <cit> . interestingly, and importantly, the t77r substitution did not significantly affect the binding affinity of the natural agonist acetylcholine. the mutation described in this study therefore appears to confer a 'vertebrate-like' quality to the β <dig> subunit of resistant aphids resulting in reduced sensitivity of the nachr to neonicotinoids through the loss of direct electrostatic interactions of the electronegative pharmacophore with the basic arginine residue at this key position within loop d. the discovery of the mutation at a predicted resistance 'hotspot'  <cit>  and its association with the reduced affinity of the nachr for imidacloprid also provides further validation of existing models of neonicotinoid binding and selectivity for insect nachrs.

in a recent study of neonicotinoid resistant housefly, musca domestica reduced expression of a nachr alpha subunit  was correlated with the resistance phenotype  <cit> . given that radioligand binding assays revealed significant changes to the nature of imidacloprid binding in the frc strain it would be interesting, in future, to investigate if changes in the expression of different nachr subunit genes are also associated with resistance.

the relative role of the two mechanisms  in determining the resistance phenotype warrants further study. in particular, the potency and dominance characteristics of target-site resistance alone, and the practical impact of different combinations of mechanisms on the efficacy of foliar and systemic applications of neonicotinoids remain to be investigated. it is possible that target-site resistance has evolved in a genetic background of enhanced p <dig> production and that the mechanisms act synergistically to confer unprecedented levels of resistance to neonicotinoids in m. persicae.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we describe, for the first time, a clone of m. persicae exhibiting control-compromising levels of resistance to neonicotinoid insecticides. we demonstrate that resistance is associated with enhanced imidacloprid metabolism and over-expression of cytochrome p450s but that additional major mechanisms based on reduced affinity of the target-site to the neonicotinoid imidacloprid are involved. we provide strong evidence that resistance is conferred, in part, through mutation of a key residue in the loop d region of a nachr β <dig> subunit and this represents the first example of field-evolved target-site resistance to neonicotinoid insecticides.
