BACKGROUND
bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough or pertussis produces several virulence factors during the course of infection, including adhesins, toxins and lipopolysaccharide  <cit> . fimbriae are long, filamentous appendages reaching out from the outer membrane of the bacterium. structurally they consist of two proteins, major and minor subunit, the latter of which is considered an adhesin  <cit> . even though the in vivo mechanism by which the fimbriae interact with the host is not fully understood, it is evident that fimbriae elicit protective immune responses and therefore are included in some acellular pertussis vaccines  <cit> .

expression of fimbriae is regulated at two levels: as part of bordetella virulence gene -locus and as an individual gene through phase variation  <cit> . by this form of phenotypic variation where the changes are heritable as well as reversible, bacteria gain increased persistence in the host environment  <cit> . in b. pertussis the level of expression of the two phase-variable major subunits of fimbriae, fim <dig> and fim <dig>  determines the serotype which can therefore be either fim <dig>  fim <dig> or fim <dig> . a homopolymeric tract of cytosine is located at the promoter region of fim-genes, and a small deletion or insertion of c's there can cause the phase transition between the high and low level of expression  <cit> . serotyping has been an essential part of characterizing b. pertussis clinical isolates for a long time  <cit>  and studies on strain variation have shown that b. pertussis populations are dynamic and continuously evolving  <cit> .

generally, vaccination has been shown to induce a shift in fim expression of the strains in a way that in unvaccinated populations fim <dig> strains are predominant, while they are largely displaced by fim <dig> strains when vaccination is introduced with a whole cell vaccine containing both fim <dig> and fim <dig>  <cit> . in finland, whole-cell vaccine has been used since  <dig>  from  <dig> vaccine consisted of the serotype fim <dig> strain  <dig>  because of the predominance of the fim <dig> strains in the country, the serotype fim <dig>  strain  <dig> was added. the vaccine with equal amounts of two strains remained the same until  <dig> when the whole cell vaccine was replaced by the acellular vaccine containing only pertussis toxin  and filamentous hemagglutinin. the vaccine coverage of four doses has been > 90%.

in the present study, we compared serotypes of b. pertussis strains circulating in finland over time. a large number of clinical isolates from  <dig> to  <dig> were available for the analysis. we also investigated the antibody responses to b. pertussis fimbrial antigens during infection and serotype-specific antibody responses by a newly developed blocking elisa.

RESULTS
serotype of b. pertussis isolates
from  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig>  isolates were collected and serotyped . in  <dig> and  <dig>  serotype distributions of fim <dig>  fim <dig> and fim <dig>  were 67% , 19%  and 10% , respectively. from  <dig> to  <dig>  94%  of the isolates were fim <dig>  two nationwide epidemics occurred in finland in  <dig> and 2003â€“ <dig>  in  <dig>  the frequency of fim <dig> started to increase and reached 83%  in  <dig>  the highest observed during the study period. the frequency of fim <dig>  strains has remained low throughout the whole period .

anti-pertussis igg antibodies
serum samples from  <dig> patients with culture-confirmed pertussis were available for studying of antibody responses to ptx and purified fim2/ <dig> mixture. there were  <dig> paired and  <dig> single sera. serotype distributions of the corresponding isolates were 85% for fim <dig>  10% for fim <dig>  and 5% for fim <dig> .

from  <dig> patients for whom diagnosis was confirmed by culture, paired serum samples were available. most of the paired serum samples were taken at the early  and at the late stage  of infection. the mean of interval between the paired sera was  <dig> days . the levels of anti-fim and anti-ptx-igg antibodies were determined. a significant increase between the paired sera was found in the levels of igg antibodies to ptx  and fim2/ <dig> mixture  . for the  <dig> single sera, igg antibodies to ptx were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  eu and igg antibodies to fim2/ <dig> mixture  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  eu.

igg antibodies were also determined in  <dig> single serum samples of patients with serologically diagnosed pertussis in  <dig>  the mean level of igg antibodies was  <dig>   for ptx and  <dig>   for fim2/ <dig>  a level similar to that obtained from second serum samples of patients with culture-confirmed pertussis.

as a negative control, paired serum samples from  <dig> randomly selected vaccine recipients who received one booster dose of a three-component acellular pertussis vaccine not including fimbriae were analyzed. no change in the levels of anti-fim2/ <dig> igg antibodies was found between the paired sera, whereas a significant increase in anti-ptx igg levels were observed  <dig> days after the vaccination .

detection of epitope-specific antibody responses to fimbriae
the blocking assay was developed for the detection of epitope-specific antibodies against the fimbriae. because there are no purified fim  <dig> and fim <dig> antigens available separately, it is not possible to differentiate antibodies to fim <dig> from those to fim <dig> by conventional elisa. in this blocking assay antibodies formed against fim <dig> or fim <dig> are detected as they block the binding of monoclonal antibodies to fim <dig> or fim <dig> antigen, which in this case are fim <dig> and fim <dig> expressing b. pertussis strains. the blocking assay has been previously used for the detection of antibodies against pertactin  <cit> .

first we studied the specific binding of the monoclonal antibodies, designated mabfim <dig> and mabfim <dig> to the two types of coating antigens: purified fim2/ <dig> mixture and fim2- or fim3-expressing b. pertussis strains s <dig> and s <dig>  specific binding of monoclonal antibodies to fim2- or fim3-expressing b. pertussis strains as well as to fim2/ <dig> mixture was observed.

next we examined if there was difference in the blocking of binding of mabfim <dig> and mabfim <dig> to the two types of coating antigens by human antibodies. because the blocking of binding of mabfim <dig> and mabfim <dig> to coating antigens was only observed in presence of serum anti-fim antibodies and the blocking effect seemed to be dose-dependent , ten serum samples were randomly selected from the serum samples of  <dig> patients with culture-confirmed pertussis and tested. although the blocking of binding of mab to coating antigens was observed, no difference was found in the level of blocking of binding of mabfim <dig> and mabfim <dig> to the two types of coating antigens . the fim2- and fim3-expressing strains were eventually chosen as coating antigens for the study because of limited amount of purified fim2/ <dig> mixture.

in presence of serum from patient infected with fim <dig> strains, blocking of binding of mabfim <dig> to s <dig> was observed , whereas blocking of binding of mabfim <dig> to s <dig> was not changed in presence of serum from patient infected with fim <dig> strains. in figure  <dig>  patients 48i and 10ii were infected by fim <dig> strains and patient  <dig> by fim <dig> strain. the level of blocking of binding of mabfim <dig> to s <dig> was 54%, 81% and 6%, respectively . blocking of binding of mabfim <dig> and mabfim <dig> to s <dig> and s <dig> by normal sheep serum in pbs  was not observed.

in presence of serum from patient infected with fim <dig> strain, blocking of binding of mabfim <dig> to s <dig> was observed . however, in presence of sera from some of patients infected with fim <dig> strains, blocking of binding of mabfim <dig> to s <dig> was also found, indicating the presence of anti-fim <dig> antibodies in the patients infected with fim <dig> strains. the level of blocking of binding of mabfim <dig> to s <dig> was 81%, 26% and 74% for patients 48i, 10ii and  <dig>  respectively .

no cross-reaction between mabfim <dig> and s <dig> or mabfim <dig> and s <dig> was observed, no matter in presence or absence of patient serum . two dilutions  of serum samples were tested. blocking of binding of mabs to fim <dig> or fim <dig> expressing strains was increased relative to increasing serum concentration, showing that the blocking effect is dose-dependent.

blocking levels of sera from patients with culture-confirmed pertussis
altogether  <dig> serum samples from culture-confirmed patients of which  <dig> had paired samples were investigated for development of specific antibodies against fim <dig> and fim <dig> during infection. of the  <dig> patients with paired sera,  <dig> were infected by fim <dig> strains, two by fim <dig>  strains and one by fim <dig> strain. in addition, three single serum samples were obtained from fim <dig> infected patients.

all four patients infected with fim <dig> strains had high levels of blocking of binding of mabfim <dig> to s <dig> , whereas the blocking levels of mabfim <dig> to s <dig> were marginal . two patients infected with fim <dig>  strains had high levels of blocking of binding of both antibodies, 57% and 56% for mabfim <dig> to s <dig> and 80% and 89% for mabfim <dig> to s <dig> in their second sera.

the range of serum blocking level of mabfim <dig> to s <dig> in the first sera of fim2-infected patients was from 0% to 62%  and in second sera from 9% to 93% . the difference between paired sera was statistically significant . the blocking levels of mabfim <dig> to s <dig> were also tested for fim2-infected patients. thirty-four fim2-infected patients were divided into three groups according to level of igg antibodies to fim2/ <dig> mixture and blocking levels of mabfim <dig> to s <dig> and mabfim <dig> to fim <dig> between the paired sera.

group  <dig> included  <dig> patients who had significant increases in level of igg antibodies to fim2/ <dig> mixture and in blocking level of mabfim <dig> to s <dig> between paired sera  but had no change in blocking level of mabfim <dig> to s <dig> .

group  <dig> consisted of  <dig> patients who had significant increases in level of igg antibodies to fim2/ <dig> mixture and in blocking levels of both mabfim <dig> to s <dig> and mabfim <dig> to s <dig> between paired sera  .

group  <dig> included  <dig> patients who had no change either in level of igg antibodies to fim2/ <dig> mixture or in blocking levels of both mabfim <dig> to s <dig> and mabfim <dig> to s <dig> between paired sera .

of the  <dig> fim2-infected patients,  <dig> patients had already had high level of the blocking  of mabfim <dig> to s <dig> in the first sera, and in  <dig> of them the blocking level remained high in the second sera. of the  <dig> patients,  <dig> were in group  <dig>   <dig> in group  <dig>  and  <dig> in group  <dig> . taken together, the patients who were infected with fim <dig> strains, can also produce anti-fim <dig> antibodies which indicate that fim <dig> strains may express fim <dig> during the course of infection.

blocking levels of sera from patients with serologically confirmed pertussis
of the  <dig> patients who were infected by fim <dig> strains and had paired sera ,  <dig>  had significant increases in level of igg antibodies to fim2/ <dig> mixture and in blocking level of mabfim <dig> to s <dig> . all the  <dig> patients had blocking level of mabfim <dig> to s <dig> â‰¤ 30% in their first sera . of the four patients infected by fim <dig> strains, one had paired sera and three had only single sera. all four patients had blocking level of binding of mabfim <dig> to s <dig> > 50%. therefore, 40% was empirically determined as cut-off level and considered significant.

in  <dig> sera of patients with serologically diagnosed pertussis in  <dig>  the range of blocking level was 0% to  <dig> %  for mabfim <dig> to s <dig> and  <dig> % to  <dig> %  for mabfim <dig> to s <dig>  in  <dig> sera the blocking level of mabfim <dig> to s <dig> was considered significant , whereas in  <dig> sera the blocking level of mabfim <dig> to s <dig> was significant. in five sera the significant blocking levels were detected for both mabfim <dig> to s <dig> and mabfim <dig> to s <dig> 

since no blocking of mabfim <dig> to s <dig> was detected in sera of culture-confirmed patients infected by fim <dig> strains , the five patients who had significant blocking for both seemed to be infected by fim <dig> or fim <dig>  strains. if this is the case,  <dig>  of  <dig> patients would have been infected by fim <dig> strains. in finland, a nationwide epidemic occurred in  <dig> to  <dig>  during this period, the serotype distributions of fim <dig>  fim <dig> and fim <dig>  were 32%, 66% and 1%, respectively, when  <dig> b. pertussis isolates were collected and tested.

discussion
in this study, we present the epidemiology of different serotypes of b. pertussis strains circulating in finland where the vaccination against pertussis has been used since early 1950s. results are based on an analysis of a large number of isolates collected over time covering four decades. in addition, we investigated human antibody responses to b. pertussis fimbrial antigens during infection and serotype-specific antibodies by a newly developed blocking elisa. our data suggest that fim <dig> strains can express both fim <dig> and fim <dig> during infection, showing a difference in fimbrial expression between in vitro and in vivo. to our knowledge, this is the first study that shows that b. pertussis serotype detected in vitro may not reflect its expression in vivo.

many studies have shown that fim <dig> isolates predominate in unvaccinated populations, while they are largely displaced by fim <dig> strains when vaccination is introduced with a whole cell vaccine containing both fim <dig> and fim <dig>  <cit> . in sweden, before  <dig> when the whole-cell vaccine was used, 70% of circulating strains were fim <dig>  <cit> . from  <dig> to  <dig> when the pertussis vaccination was stopped, fim <dig> started to increase and reached 64% in early 1990s. in  <dig> when general vaccination with an acellular vaccine was reintroduced, the prevalence of fim <dig> declined and fim <dig> strains emerged rapidly. in  <dig> and  <dig>  serotype fim <dig> constituted 96% among fully vaccinated individuals. in contrast to the high prevalence of fim <dig> strains in many countries with long-term vaccination, fim <dig> has been the prevalent serotype in finland for more than  <dig> years. the finnish whole cell vaccine contains two strains expressing fim <dig> and fim <dig> , and this vaccine has remained the same since  <dig>  the exact reasons for the dominance of serotype fim <dig> strains in finland are not known. one explanation is that different whole cell vaccines were used in different countries. the exact amounts of fim <dig> and fim <dig> in these vaccines are unknown, although all whole cell pertussis vaccines used in the world contain both fim <dig> and fim <dig> as recommended by who. another explanation is that immunity to fim <dig> and fim <dig> in finnish population might not be the same as in other populations. the population immunity to fimbrial antigens comes from vaccination or natural infection or both. we have previously compared clinical isolates recovered since the early 1990s in finland and france, two countries with similar histories of long-term mass vaccination with whole cell vaccines. in france, 90% of isolates in 1990s were fim <dig>  furthermore, although isolates in both countries were genetically similar, they varied temporally  <cit> .

it is recommended that monoclonal antibodies are used for serotyping of b. pertussis and that fim2- and fim3-expressing reference strains are included as controls  <cit> . the two mabs used in the present study were produced from hybridoma cell lines bpf <dig> and bpc <dig> and were proven to be specific for serotype fim <dig> and serotype fim <dig>  <cit> . they are being used in many countries for serotyping. the same mabs and reference strains were also used in the blocking elisa. no cross reaction was found between mabs and reference strains used as coating antigens. moreover, all patients who were infected with fim <dig> strains had developed specific antibodies to fim <dig> but not to fim <dig>  the development of anti-fim <dig> antibodies was also observed in sera of patients with serologically diagnosed pertussis in  <dig> when fim <dig> strains were prevalent.

it is known that b. parapertussis also produces similar virulence factors including fimbriae. in finland, infections caused by b. parapertussis are detected in children  <dig> to  <dig> years of age  <cit> . eight finnish b. parapertussis strains isolated during 1990s were randomly selected from our strain collection and tested for agglutination with the two mabs used in the present study and no agglutination was detected . this indicates that there is no cross reaction between the mabs and b. parapertussis. however, it remains to be studied if sera from parapertussis patients can block the binding of the mabs to fim2- or fim3-expressing strains.

fim  <dig> and  <dig> are similar in structure since they have an nh2-terminal amino acid sequence homology of about 75% and have identical helical structures demonstrated by electron microscopic analysis  <cit> . moreover, the two fimbriae were found to contain unique antigenic epitopes, which is consistent with their being serotype-specific agglutinogens  <cit> . in a previous report, robinson and his colleagues showed that fim <dig> and fim <dig> are generally not cross-reactive  <cit> . although some cross-reactivity was mentioned, the cross-reactive epitopes could be non-protective epitopes. they also found that immunization of mice with sero-specific agglutinogen resulted in immune selection so that organisms recovered following infection did not express the immunizing antigen  <cit> . in this present study, 32% of patients who were infected with fim <dig> strains had developed igg antibodies which blocked the binding of anti-fim <dig> monoclonal antibodies to fim <dig>  indicating that the antibodies were induced by fim <dig> antigen. therefore, in addition to expression of fim <dig>  the fim <dig> strains might express fim <dig> in vivo during the interaction with host cells. alternatively, these patients might have been previously infected with a fim <dig> strain. upon subsequent infection with a fim <dig> strain, not only a new immune response to fim <dig> specific epitopes but also a boosting response to fim2/ <dig> cross-reactive epitopes  would be induced. it is interesting to study if there is cross-reactive immune response induced by the two fimbriae and if the cross-reactive immune response is protective or not. the expression of different fimbrial major subunits is phase variable and is a consequence of insertion or deletion of cytosines in c-rich region at the promoter region of fim <dig> and fim <dig> genes  <cit> . phase variation is one means for the bacterium to create phenotypic divergence and to avoid host defense mechanisms  <cit> . fimbriae have also shown some level of phase variation in vivo  <cit> . neisseria meningitidis has a phase-variable immunogenic outer membrane protein, pora, which has a control mechanism similar to bordetella fimbriae. the length of variable homopolymeric tracts at the promoter regions of pora showed variation between strains isolated from carriers and strains isolated from patients  <cit> .

recently, the annotated genome sequence of b. pertussis was published  <cit> . the genome contains  <dig>  orfs. according to the sequenced genome, the genes encoding fim <dig>  and fim <dig>  are located apart from each other, suggesting that in certain circumstances the regulation of expression of the two genes may be different. a recent study where microarray-based gene expression profiling was used, reported differential modulation of b. pertussis virulence genes  <cit> . in the b. pertussis strain, which represents serotype fim <dig>  the fim <dig> gene was found to be expressed in virulence repressing conditions, whereas fim <dig> was expressed in virulence activating conditions and confirmed to be a virulence activated gene. another study has also confirmed that in b. pertussis fim <dig> gene but not fim <dig> gene was bvg-activated gene  <cit> .

in vaccinated populations, symptoms of pertussis can be mild and the patients do not usually seek for medical help. therefore the possibility that some of patients who were infected by fim <dig> strains may have already had infections caused by fim <dig> strains, could not be excluded. however, the frequency of circulating fim <dig> strains was very low in finland during the period when the sera were collected. also, according to the finnish vaccination schedule and the age of patients at the time of sampling, it is unlikely that the anti-fim <dig> antibodies detected in patients who were infected by fim <dig> strains were due to recent vaccinations.

in the present study, some patients who were infected by fim <dig> strains had already had anti-fim <dig> antibodies in the first sera , and in most of them levels of the antibodies remained unchanged in the second sera. one explanation might be that the first serum samples had been taken when the patients were already at the convalescent phase or these patients had developed anti-fim antibodies exceptionally rapidly.

b. pertussis continues to cause epidemics in vaccinated populations in spite of high vaccination coverage. as a result of this study we gained more information of the possible mechanisms the bacterium uses to infect highly vaccinated populations. this information is important for the future development of vaccines against pertussis.

CONCLUSIONS
despite extensive vaccinations in finland, fim <dig> strains were the most common serotype. fim <dig> strains emerged since  <dig> and the emergence coincided with nationwide epidemics. in a population with long-term vaccinations, fim <dig> strains could express fim <dig> during infection, showing a difference in fimbrial expression between in vivo and in vitro.

materials and methods
bacterial strains, serum samples and study subjects
a total of  <dig>  b. pertussis isolates were obtained from  <dig> to  <dig> and stored in strain collections of the department of vaccine, national public health institute, helsinki  and the pertussis reference laboratory, national public health institute, turku . the number of isolates collected each year varied from  <dig> to  <dig> and was  <dig> in 1974â€“ <dig>   <dig> in 1977â€“ <dig>   <dig> in 1980â€“ <dig>   <dig> in 1983â€“ <dig>   <dig> in 1986â€“ <dig>   <dig> in 1989â€“ <dig>   <dig> in 1992â€“ <dig>   <dig> in 1995â€“ <dig>   <dig> in 1998â€“ <dig>   <dig> in 2001â€“ <dig>   <dig> in 2004â€“ <dig>  the isolates had been sent from the local clinical microbiology laboratories or collected during the outbreaks of pertussis.

of the strains studied,  <dig> were isolated from patients from whom serum samples were also available. the serum samples were collected at the pertussis reference laboratory of the national public health institute, turku, finland. no selection of the serum samples was done, because all the patients from whom both sera and bacterial strains were available were included. of the  <dig> patients,  <dig> were diagnosed in 1990s  <cit> , one was in  <dig> and one was in  <dig>  of the  <dig> patients whose vaccination status was investigated,  <dig> had received four doses of finnish diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis vaccine and  <dig> had received three doses of the same vaccine. none of the  <dig> patients had received acellular pertussis vaccine because in finland the acellular vaccine was introduced in january  <dig>  age of the  <dig> patients ranged from  <dig> months to  <dig> years . of the patients,  <dig> had paired sera and  <dig> single sera. the mean of interval between the paired sera was  <dig> days . of the  <dig> patients who had paired sera,  <dig> had already cough at the first blood sampling, three developed cough later and two remained asymptomatic  <cit> .

fim <dig> strains predominated in 1990s and fim <dig> strains started to increase since  <dig>  because only two culture-positive patients had sera available since  <dig>   <dig> sera from patients who were serologically diagnosed in  <dig> at the department of medical microbiology and immunology, university of turku, turku were included  <cit> . the selection criteria for the  <dig> patients were based on diagnostic level of serum anti-ptx igg antibodies. age of the patients ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> years . only single sera were available from the patients.

in addition, paired serum samples from  <dig> vaccinees were randomly selected to serve as negative controls for detection of antibody responses to fimbrial antigens. the vaccinees received one booster dose of acellular pertussis vaccine containing ptx, filamentous hemagglutinin and pertactin but not fimbriae  <cit> . the serum samples were taken before and  <dig> days after the booster vaccination. age of the subjects ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> years.

serotyping
serotyping of b. pertussis strains was done by slide agglutination or indirect elisa. the slide agglutination test was performed as described previously  <cit> . in the indirect elisa method, validated by tsang et al.  <cit>  the microtiter plate was coated overnight at room temperature with  <dig> Î¼l of b. pertussis suspension, inactivated at 56Â°c for  <dig> hour, with od  <dig>  at  <dig> nm. strains specifically expressing either fim <dig> or fim <dig>  kindly provided by dr. d. xing, national institute for biological standards and control , uk, were included in each run as positive controls. wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline  and blocked with  <dig> Î¼l 1% normal sheep serum   in pbs  at 37Â°c for  <dig> hour. after the blocking and each following incubation step wells were washed three times with  <dig> %  nacl,  <dig> %tween <dig>  . anti-fim <dig> or anti-fim <dig> monoclonal antibodies  diluted in pbs , produced and provided by nibsc, uk were added, and the plate was incubated at 37Â°c for  <dig> hours. anti-mouse antibodies   were added, and the plate was incubated at 37Â°c for  <dig> h. after the addition of phosphatase substrate  in diethanolamine-mgcl2-buffer , absorbance at  <dig> nm was measured with victor  <dig> multilabel counter  consecutively until the absorbance of control strains reached  <dig> .

elisa for determination of serum igg antibody
for determination of serum igg antibodies to ptx and purified fim2/ <dig> mixture microtiter plates were coated with  <dig> Î¼g/ml of purified ptx or purified fim2/ <dig> mixture for overnight at room temperature. ptx was kindly provided by glaxosmithkline biologicals, rixensart, belgium. fim2/ <dig> mixture preparation  was provided by nibsc, uk and with purity of â‰¥ 95% of fim 2/ <dig> components by sds-page. due to absence of standards for purified fim  <dig> and fim  <dig> antigen, the proportion of each fim <dig> and fim <dig> in this mixture preparation has not been defined. if assuming similar affinity for both anti-fim <dig> and fim <dig> mabs to the antigens, this preparation contains 10% higher amount of fim  <dig> than fim  <dig> by in-house elisas. the detailed elisa used in the present study was described earlier  <cit> . plates were washed with  <dig> Î¼l pbs and then incubated with  <dig> Î¼l 1% nss-pbs at 37Â°c for  <dig> hour. serum samples diluted 1: <dig> were added and incubated in duplicate wells at 37Â°c for  <dig> hours. after igg conjugate diluted 1: <dig>  was incubated at 37Â°c for  <dig> hours,  <dig> Î¼l of phosphatase substrate  in diethanolamine-mgcl2-buffer  was added. absorbance in  <dig> nm was measured consecutively until the absorbance of positive serum pool reached  <dig> . the positive and negative pool sera were included in each run, and results were expressed as relative elisa units .

blocking elisa
blocking elisa  <cit>  was used to test the ability of human antibodies to compete with specific monoclonal antibodies in binding to fim <dig> or fim <dig> expressing strains. the mabs used in blocking elisa were the same as those for serotyping. microtiter plates were coated with  <dig> Î¼l of bacterial suspension of b. pertussis strains expressing either fim <dig> or fim <dig> for overnight at room temperature . plates were washed with  <dig> Î¼l pbs, ph  <dig>  2â€“ <dig>   <dig> and incubated with  <dig> Î¼l 1% nss-pbs at 37Â°c for  <dig> hour and washed three times with  <dig> Î¼l  <dig> % nacl,  <dig> % tween <dig> . the nacl-tween buffer was used for washings. one hundred microliter of serum samples diluted 1: <dig> were added in duplicate wells and were incubated at 37Â°c for  <dig> hours. nss-pbs and samples from negative and positive serum pool were used as controls and included in each run. one hundred microliter of mabfim <dig> or mabfim <dig> diluted 1: <dig> in pbs were added, and the plates were incubated at 37Â°c for  <dig> hours. anti-mouse conjugate  diluted 1: <dig> in nss-pbs was added and incubated at 37Â°c for  <dig> hours. finally,  <dig> Î¼l of phospathase substrate  in diethanolamine-mgcl2-buffer  was added. absorbance in  <dig> nm was measured consecutively until the absorbance of nss-pbs was reached to  <dig> . the relative blocking of binding of mab to fim <dig> or fim <dig> was calculated as 100% â€“ absorbance of testing serum/absorbance of nss-pbs. blocking level of a serum â‰¥ 40% was considered significant.

statistical analysis
paired t-test was used for statistical analysis of the differences in level of antibodies and relative blocking of binding of mab between paired serum samples. p value <  <dig>  was considered significant.
