BACKGROUND
the genus amaranthus is comprised by more than  <dig> species. it belongs to the amaranthaceae family that also includes sugar beet, spinach, chenopodium spp. and several halophytes  <cit> . they are c <dig> dicotyledonous annual plants, many of which are ubiquitous weeds , whereas others , are used as foliar vegetables of high vitamin and mineral content, mainly in asia and africa  <cit> . they may be also a source of grain . the latter are pseudo-cereals capable of producing seeds of high nutritive and nutraceutical value, granted by their optimal amino-acid balance, potential to release bioactive peptides upon digestion and relatively high squalene levels  <cit> . they are hardy plants with the ability to grow in poor soils or under unfavorable growing conditions, mostly involving low water availability, high salinity and/or high light intensity  <cit> .

vegetable and grain amaranthus species have been reported to sustain high rates of infestation by herbivorous insects under field conditions, with differing effects on productivity  <cit> . tolerance to defoliation in a. hybridus was associated with a greater investment in below-ground biomass relative to above-ground vegetative biomass, occurring mostly as the result of pre-flowering allocation of carbohydrates  and nitrogen resources to the taproot  <cit> . vegetable amaranths have been shown to recover exceptionally well from herbivore damage by grasshoppers and lepidopteran larvae  <cit> . however, certain insect pests can significantly reduce grain yield and increase the risk of lodging and infection by root and stem fungal pathogens  <cit> . defoliation of grain amaranths by lepidopteran larvae at an early developmental stage has also been found to result in a long-term reduction in plant size and yield  <cit> . insect infestation was more deleterious under drought-stress conditions  <cit> . controlled experiments indicate that several amaranthus species can fully recover from complete mechanical defoliation with small to negligible effects on fitness and yield . moreover, mechanical removal of 10-to-40% of the primary shoot of grain amaranth plants is practiced in certain regions of mexico to enhance secondary branching and biomass productivity  <cit> .

plants can respond to injury, including defoliation, by the deployment of a plethora of direct and/or indirect defenses  <cit> . however, when defenses are costly to produce or the resource demands for defense compete with those of growth and reproduction, damaged plants may undergo physiological changes such as the activation of dormant meristems, modified plant architecture, increased photosynthetic capacity, and/or the partitioning of resources among growth, storage, and reproduction, among others, in order to cope with the stress imposed by defoliation  <cit> .

source-sink relationship and carbon allocation in plants are regulated by complex metabolic and signaling networks  <cit> . carbon levels in storage organs influence the net photosynthetic activity in source tissues, whereas the expression of photosynthesis-related enzymes in leaves is modified by sugar levels  <cit> . however, the mechanisms whereby sugars act to regulate source gene expression in c <dig> plants remain relatively unexamined  <cit> .

previous studies have focused on the defoliation responses of grain amaranth mostly in an ecological context. here, we performed a more comprehensive study, involving a multifaceted approach, including genomic, promoter, gene expression and metabolite analyses in addition to enzyme activity assays. two different defoliation treatments, insect herbivory  and mechanical damage , were tested considering that the responses to artificial defoliation can differ qualitatively and/or quantitatively from those produced by natural herbivory [see above; also  <cit> . the available genomic information of amaranthus hypochondriacus  <cit>  was employed as a basis for gene selection and subsequent design of specific primers for real time pcr analysis and to isolate and characterize key genes involved in non-structural carbohydrate  metabolism. gene expression at different times was studied in both sink and source tissues of damaged and control plants. the response depended strongly on the way defoliation was performed, as herbivory damage generally led to more intense changes in expression. the levels of many transcripts, enzymes and metabolites  changed as a result of defoliation , thereby suggesting that tolerance to defoliation in amaranth might depend on the regulated use of nsc reserves controlled by key metabolic enzymes/genes. thus, candidate grain amaranth genes known to influence c allocation and sink-source relationships in other plant models were analyzed in detail and some of them were cloned. however, the relationships between transcripts and enzymes were not always as straightforward as desired.

RESULTS
selection and cloning of amaranth genes
previous knowledge of primary metabolism and stress tolerance in other model species, and preliminary expression data in amaranth directed the selection a total of  <dig> genes. for a more detailed description see additional file  <dig>  in addition, seven cdnas and two genomic sequences of key genes involved in carbon  partitioning were characterized . two of the seven sucrose synthase  isoforms detected in the transcriptomic analysis  <cit>  were chosen for further analysis. the phylogenetic analysis  showed that ahsus- <dig> and ahsus- <dig> were highly homologous to the sbss1- <dig> isoforms present in beta vulgaris. these have been shown to be regulated by development and by several types of stress  <cit> . plant invertases conform another multigenic family importantly involved in carbohydrate  mobilization. in grain amaranth, this family is represented by at least  <dig> isoforms. two isoforms belonging to the alkaline neutral invertase subfamily, aha/ni1- <dig>  were selected for further study taking into account their similarity to invertases that are localized to the chloroplast; in wheat and arabidopsis, their activity has been shown to be up-regulated by environmental stresses  <cit> . on the other hand, ahvi- <dig> was selected from a total of four vacuolar invertase isoforms on the basis of its high similarity to a vacuolar invertase in b. vulgaris, bvvi, which has been shown to play an important role in c partition  <cit> . the only putative cell wall invertase  isoform identified so far in graisfsffwr2n amaranth, ahcwi, is related to cwis in b. vulgaris , vicia faba  and tomato  which are known for their capacity to regulate sink strength in seeds and roots and participate in the wound response, respectively  <cit>  . the phylogenetic relationship between the adp glucose pyrophosphorylases  found in grain amaranth suggests that the subunits that conforms the enzyme tetramer are being codified by at least four genes, two of which, ahagp-l <dig> and − <dig> may be involved in stress responses. this is implied by their similarity to agpl1- <dig> in tomato, which has been shown to be induced by salt stress in an aba- and osmotic-stress independent way  <cit> . in contrast, only one small agp subunit has been identified in grain amaranth, ahagps- <dig>  this protein is related to homologs in other plants, such as tobacco, maize and pea, where they are known to participate in development programs and in stress-resistance responses  <cit>  . the partial sequence of six plant invertase inhibitors, which are small proteins  targeted to the cell wall or vacuole in a variety of species  <cit> , was also used to determine their phylogenetic relationships. the analysis showed that ahinvi- <dig> had a close relationship to the arabidopsis atc/vif- <dig>  a confirmed vacuolar invertase inhibitor and that ahinvi1- <dig> resembled apoplastic-localized inhibitors involved in both development  and stress response processes , respectively  <cit>  . the genomic sequences of a vacuolar invertase  and of a plastidial adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase small subunit gene  included a sizeable section of their respective promoter regions. promoter analysis of adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase and vacuolar invertase genes indicated the presence of cis-regulatory elements that supported their responsiveness to defoliation . not surprisingly, the majority of the amaranth genes and proteins analyzed shared the highest level of identity with similar proteins previously reported in sugar beet, except for aha/ni- <dig>  which had a higher resemblance to an invertase isolated from carrot  <cit> . this coincided with the close phylogentic relationship shared by amaranthus spp. and b. vulgaris <cit> . an interesting aspect of the promoter regions of the ahagps- <dig> gene was that it had a higher representation of regulatory elements involved in defense responses than that of an orthologous gene identified in solanum tuberosum <cit> . on the other hand, a striking difference found between the promoter regions of the ahvi-i and the b. vulgaris vacuolar invertase genes, respectively, was the lower abundance, in the former, of important cis-regulatory elements of genes involved in aba and ja signaling pathways activated in response to biotic stress and wounding  . the expression of the selected genes was analyzed and correlated to the changes in carbohydrate  content and enzyme activities, as described in the following sections.

changes in cho levels produced in response to partial defoliation in a. cruentus
partial defoliation  was produced in 30-day-old plants either by mechanical damage  or insect feeding . measurements were made at different days post partial defoliation :  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dppd in three independent experiments. the choice of these time points was based on preliminary experiments  <cit> .

starch, suc, glc and frc levels were determined in source leaves, stems, roots and panicles of a. cruentus  plants . the general trend was that all non-structural carbohydrate  levels were reduced in most tissues as a result of defoliation . starch and hexoses were the nscs more profoundly affected by defoliation. starch was predominantly reduced in leaves of md and hd plants compared to undamaged controls , whereas hexoses were depleted in leaves, stems and roots of md and hd plants compared to undamaged controls . the effect was rapid, since it occurred most dramatically at  <dig> dppd and was still evident at  <dig> dppd . hexoses depletion at times when sucrolytic activities were high  suggested that their utilization rate in the defoliated plants surpassed their enzymatic release rate from sucrose. the rapid and general reduction in nsc reserves occurring in response to defoliation was very similar to the one observed when plants were c-starved by shading for three consecutive days . this similarity supports our proposal that foliar starch and other c reserves are rapidly metabolized to sustain growth when they are depleted by factors that affect c acquisition in leaves, such as reduced leaf area or light limitation.

on the long term most nsc levels recovered or maintained control levels at  <dig> dppd, and in some isolated cases surpassed them . it was also evident that md and hd led to similar changes in nsc levels, except in panicles, where hd had a strong negative effect in all nscs except suc .

starch was the most abundant nsc reserve in the leaves of ac plants . this agreed with the high starch accumulation in leaves of sugar beet, a close relative of amaranth  <cit> . starch levels in leaves and panicles were ~ <dig> times higher than roots and stems . starch increased approximately 2-fold during development, but the hd and md treatments consistently decreased starch levels compared to the control plants . this pattern suggested that the mobilization of the ample starch reserves in leaves of ac could be a key factor for recovery after defoliation. it was in agreement with the frequently observed mobilization of starch reserves to sustain new plant growth after defoliation and with the proposed role of leaf and stem starch as a buffer against abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> . curiously, these results had a closer resemblance to the long-term responses to defoliation reported in woody plants than to those registered in annual grasses and shrubs. in the former species, defoliation has been frequently found to cause short-term reductions in c stores, present primarily in leaves, but no long term depletion after repeated defoliation  <cit> . on the other hand, seasonal defoliation studies performed with c <dig> grasses  and shrubs , have reported more diverse outcomes. these include, in l. perenne, an accumulation of c reserves that was subsequently used to secure survival after repeated grazing  <cit> . in contrast, a drastic reduction in soluble carbon pools was detected in agropyron bunchgrasses after severe defoliation treatments that impeded full recovery due to a limited replenishment capacity  <cit> . in shrubs, reduced leaf longevity and accumulation of below-ground carbon reserves allowed full compensation in terms of fruit output in defoliated r. nudiflora <cit> , whereas c. korshinskii relied on the preferential resource allocation to vegetative tissues for regrowth, at the cost of fruit production  <cit> .

it must be noted that in one experiment, in which starch levels in leaves were 2-fold higher than usual, md led to a 2-to- <dig> fold increase of starch in stems and roots at  <dig> dppd . this suggests a plastic response to defoliation in ac plants, which can sequester c in less vulnerable storage tissues when favorable growth conditions permit the accumulation of high foliar starch. also, the tissue- and ontogenetic dependent changes in nsc levels observed , implied that c resources can be preferentially allocated to certain tissues at certain developmental stages to be used for growth, reproduction or, perhaps, defense. this raised the question of which enzymes could be regulating c allocation in grain amaranth.

changes in sus activities and expression in response to partial defoliation in a. cruentus
the observed fluctuations in nsc levels in sink and source tissues in response to partial defoliation  could have been caused by changes in different sucrolytic activities present in different subcellular compartments and tissues. therefore, the activities of sus, neutral invertases, soluble acid and cell-wall-bound invertases were determined at different times after hd or md. the enzymatic assays were complemented with a qpcr expression analysis of selected isoforms and genes associated with c allocation and transport .

expression was measured at different days post partial defoliation  by insect  or mechanical  damage in different plant tissues of amaranthus cruentus. transcript levels were measured by qrt-pcr. values represent means ± se of a representative experiment with three replicates. they indicate the fold-change in gene expression levels present in tissues of defoliated plants relative to those in tissues of intact control plants. a given gene was considered induced when its relative expression values was ≥  <dig> , whereas it was considered repressed when its relative expression values was ≤  <dig> . these are shown in bold text and bold italics, respectively.

sus activity in undamaged plants remained relatively stable for the duration of the defoliation experiment, except for transient peaks in activity in stems and roots of 35 day-old plants  . defoliation had an evident effect on sus activity . for example, in leaves, both md and hd induced a 2- to 4-fold increase in sus activity at  <dig> and  <dig> dppd . the effect was reversed at  <dig> dppd, where both treatments led to a drastic reduction of sus activity . the changes of sus activity might have reflected a shift in the metabolic status of leaves, from sink to source tissues, as they gradually recovered their nsc reserves, as observed in figures  <dig> and  <dig> 

the ahsus- <dig> and ahsus- <dig> genes were more sensitive to hd than to md . the latter treatment only affected the expression of these genes in stems, where they showed a contrasting behavior . moreover, no concordance was found between the biphasic pattern of ahsus gene expression in leaves of hd plants  and enzyme activity levels, which were higher than controls shortly after defoliation and then dropped to almost undetectable levels at  <dig> dppd.

in stems of md plants, sus activity was temporarily induced above those in undamaged controls at  <dig> and  <dig> dppd. hd, in contrast, led to a rapid decline at  <dig> dppd, but maintained a long-term stability that led to higher activity levels than controls at  <dig> dppd . the significantly higher sus activity that persisted in stems of hd plants at  <dig> dppd coincided with the late induction of both ahsus- <dig> and ahsus- <dig> . in roots, md had a fast inductive effect on sus activity that was not accompanied by the induction of either of the ahsus- <dig> and ahsus- <dig> genes. similarly, the ~2-fold reduction in sus activity in panicles of hd plants was contrary to the induced expression of both ahsus genes in these tissues in hd plants . the lack of direct correlation observed between ahsus- <dig> and ahsus- <dig> expression levels and sus activity resembled the disparity observed between sus gene expression and enzyme activity in sugar beet roots subjected to wounding or anoxia, which was attributed to post-transcriptional mechanisms  <cit> . the discrepancy between sus activity and expression could also be explained by the participation of other putative sus isoforms. similarly to various other plant species  <cit> , sus genes in grain amaranth conform a multi-gene family consisting at least seven different members  <cit> .

the systemic induction of both ahsus genes and activity in stems, roots and/ or panicles of defoliated plants was consistent with the frequent induction of sus genes in roots and/or shoots of plants under stress conditions  <cit> . this argues in favor of the generation of a wound-derived systemic signal in defoliated amaranth plants, which could have been ja, a related oxylipin or even h2o <dig> .

changes in invertase activities and expression in response to partial defoliation in a. cruentus
soluble acid invertase  activity  was comparatively high in leaves of damaged young ac plants , intermediate in stems and low in roots . sai activity declined sharply in all tissues of 60 days-old-plants , except in panicles where sai activity levels were similar to those detected in stems of young plants . in leaves, the defoliation effect on sai was very similar to the one observed on sus activity  . in stems, the short term effect of hd, at  <dig> and  <dig> dppd, was negative, whereas md was neutral . in roots, the effect of defoliation was negative at  <dig> dppd, although a transient induction was observed in md plants at  <dig> dppd, whereas increased sai activity was detected in panicles of hd plants .

ahvi- <dig> expression could explain the increase of sai activity in leaves of hd, at  <dig> and  <dig> dppd, and md plants, at  <dig> dppd, and in stems of md plants, at  <dig> dppd . in addition, the late induction of the putative ahinvi- <dig> inhibitor gene predicted to target ahvi- <dig>  <cit>   correlated with the abated sai activity levels observed in leaves of hd and md plants at  <dig> dppd . the repressed expression of this inhibitor gene observed in leaves at  <dig> dppd could have also contributed to the increased sai activity detected.

the expression of a vacuolar processing enzyme gamma gene  in response to defoliation was also monitored in this study because of its known participation in the regulation of vacuolar invertase activity in planta <cit> . however, only its late induction in leaves in response to both hd and md, at  <dig> dppd, and its early and strong repression in md plants, at  <dig> dppd, coincided with modified sai activity levels . curiously, a strong repression of this gene was observed in leaves of defoliated plants at  <dig> dppd. apart from leaves, an evident damage-dependent effect on the expression of this gene was observed at this time point in stems and roots, being positive in hd plants and negative in md plants. the general lack of correlation between ah-γvpe expression and sai levels in ac indicated other possible functions of this gene in stressed plants, similar to what was recently reported in nicotiana benthamiana <cit> .

increased ahvi- <dig> transcript abundance and acid invertase activity in damaged leaves and sink tissues of defoliated ac plants was in accordance with the known up-regulation of invertases often observed after leaf damage by wounding or insect herbivory in several plant species, where they are believed to contribute to the altered source-sink relationships occurring in damaged leaves  <cit> . moreover, the pattern of ahvi- <dig> expression and sai activity suggest that this particular sucrolytic enzyme, perhaps in combination with sus activity , may play an important role in the early utilization of c reserves, predominantly in leaves, to support growth under defoliation stress in ac plants.

insoluble  acid invertase  activity was, in general, the most active type of invertase detected in ac plants. iai levels were similar in leaves and stems and lower in roots, of undamaged young ac plants and diminished in these tissues as plants aged. iai activity in young panicles was relatively high . the defoliation effect on iai activity in leaves was sporadic, only induced in leaves by hd and md at  <dig> and  <dig> dppd, respectively, and in stems, at  <dig> dppd . these minor changes in cwi activity were mirrored by no apparent changes in ahcwi gene expression levels .

ahinvi- <dig>  showed widely different patterns of expression . the expression of this inhibitor gene in leaves of hd plants also showed an inverse correlation with the pattern of cwi activity , since its down-regulation, at  <dig> dppd, correlated with augmented levels of cwi activity. the ahinvi- <dig> gene, coding for another putative cwi inhibitor, also showed tissue- and damage-dependent expression, since hd led to strong and transient repression at  <dig> dppd in all tissues examined, whereas md mostly led to a retarded to late induction, at  <dig> and  <dig> dppd, in stem and leaves. however, the target enzymes and physiological roles of these particular inhibitors in suc metabolism in ac plants remain to be determined.

neutral  invertase  was, in general, the least active type of invertase detected in ac plants. ni activity levels did not vary much at first in all tissues of undamaged young ac plants examined, but similarly to sai and iai, ni activity declined sharply in 60 days-old-plants, reaching undetectable levels in leaves . this coincided with the low to undetectable levels of expression of the neutral invertase aha/ni- <dig> gene in leaves and roots of control and defoliated plants at  <dig> dppd . similar to other sucrolytic enzymes, the development-related decrease in ni activity was not observed in panicles, where levels remained similar to those detected in younger vegetative tissues . however, the gene expression assays indicated that the persistent ni activity observed in panicles was not due to the aha/ni- <dig> gene, where the expression of this gene was not detected. on the other hand, the strong up-regulation of this gene at  <dig> dppd in stems of hd and md plants coincided only with the significantly higher ni activity levels in md stems. no such correlation was observed in older stems, where the unexpectedly high activity detected at  <dig> dppd in hd plants, was not accompanied by a concomitant increase in aha/ni- <dig> expression . the aha/ni- <dig> expression pattern observed suggested a rigid tissue-specificity, since it was not detected in roots and panicles, was mostly down-regulated in leaves, and was strongly induced in stems at  <dig> dppd. this likewise suggests the participation of other aha/ni genes in determining defoliation-induced changes in alkaline/ neutral invertase activity in the cytoplasm, and possibly in plastids and/ or mitochondria  <cit> . this is in agreement with the detection of at least  <dig> other putative ni isoforms in grain amaranth  <cit> .

genes of starch metabolism in response to partial defoliation in a. cruentus
the expression of ahagps- <dig> and ahgbss was mostly unaffected or down-regulated by defoliation . moreover, no expression of the soluble starch synthases class iii gene  was detected. in contrast, the two ahagpl genes examined in this study, showed completely different patterns of expression in response to defoliation, both with respect to ahagps- <dig> and to each other . defoliation had a neutral to negative effect on the expression of ahagpl- <dig>  and was most strongly manifested at the early stages after defoliation  in leaves and stems of damaged plants. in contrast, ahagpl- <dig> was shown to be highly sensitive to hd plants in a time- and tissue dependent manner, as manifested by its induced expression in all tissues examined, particularly at  <dig> dppd, and its consistent up-regulation in roots at all times after hd. md was a weaker stimulus and did not lead to systemic induction in roots. interestingly, defoliation by both means strongly induced this gene in panicles, which was not reflected by starch accumulation in these tissues. these above results show that the expression of these starch biosynthesis genes in ac plants is tissue-dependent and is influenced by the type of damage used for defoliation. however, the expression patterns did not coincide with the short- and long-term changes in starch levels observed in response to defoliation. this could be reflecting the complex post-translational regulation of starch synthesis known to operate in plants  <cit> . however, the strong and late expression of ahss-iv, observed in leaves of both hd and md plants at  <dig> dppd, could have contributed to the recovery of foliar starch levels in defoliated plants, similar to those in intact controls . this possibility is supported by the important role played by soluble starch synthase genes in starch biosynthesis in arabidopsis <cit> .

on the other hand, the short-term reduction of the leaf starch reserves which was followed by a subsequent recovery, correlated inversely with the pattern of amylolytic activity shown in figure  <dig>  hence, induced activity at  <dig> and  <dig> dppd , coincided with reduced starch levels, whereas an almost two-fold reduction of activity at  <dig> dppd might have been associated with the recovery of foliar starch levels in defoliated plants. the expression pattern of a β-amylase- <dig> gene in leaves of defoliated plants  was also consistent with the observed changes in both starch levels and amylolytic activity. these results were in agreement with a report showing that starch breakdown is the primary function of β-amylase in plants  <cit> , and also with several studies in which the starch degradation produced in response to defoliation was found to correlate with augmented amylolytic activity and/or induced amylase gene expression  <cit> .

the induced expression of a putative snrk <dig> regulatory gene in leaves of defoliated plants suggests the involvement of this gene in the control of c partitioning produced in response to leaf loss, presumably to alter resource allocation to allow increased tolerance to defoliation, similarly to what was reported in wild tobacco  <cit> . interestingly, the expression of this gene was fast and transient in hd plants, whereas it was delayed and persistent in md plants .

changes in the expression of a sucrose transporter gene  produced in response to partial defoliation in a. cruentus
even though the mechanism of phloem loading in ac plants is not known, the identification of ahsut <dig>  coding for a sucrose transporter gene, supports the participation of an apoplastic phloem loading process, similarly to what has been reported in several other plant species  <cit> .

this gene was also differentially affected by the way ac plants were defoliated, being more responsive to hd than to md. the effect was also tissue-, and time-dependent, since ahsut <dig> was strongly induced in hd plants in leaves  and panicles, whereas the effect in roots was negative at  <dig> dppd; roots of md plants also showed repression of this gene at  <dig> dppd. in stems, a strong early repression was observed in both hd and md plants at  <dig> dppd. in hd, this effect was reversed at  <dig> dppd . a close resemblance with several other studies showing a rapid and transient expression of suc transporters in response to defoliation by grazing or insect herbivory  <cit> , supports an important role for ahsut <dig>  as a facilitator of suc transport from the leaves, in the tolerance response to defoliation in grain amaranth.

changes in the expression of a putative phosphoenolpyruvate/ pi translocator  gene in response to partial defoliation ina. cruentus: possible relationship with transient fatty acid accumulation in roots.

in contrast to most genes examined, the pattern of expression of a putative phosphoenolpyruvate/ pi translocator  showed that, except for a few cases, md induced a generalized accumulation of ahppt transcripts in all tissues examined, which was particularly strong in roots . the strong induction of this gene detected in roots of both hd and md plants at  <dig> dppd correlated with the transient accumulation of fatty acids detected in roots . such correlation was in agreement with the fact that ppts are part of a known spectrum of plastidic phosphate translocators in non-photosynthetic plastids that deliver phosphoenolpyruvate  from the cytosol to plastids to support fatty acid biosynthesis via the action of pyruvate kinase  <cit> . in addition, the high expression this gene in leaves, at  <dig> dppd, could have been needed to import pep into chloroplasts to support tissue recovery after damage  <cit> .

changes in the expression of a putative kunitz protease inhibitor  and lipoxygenase  genes as markers of the wound response and jasmonic acid signaling in partially defoliated a. cruentus.

the protease inhibitor ahkti gene used as a marker of the wound response showed the expected rapid and stable induction in leaves in response to hd and md, as shown by a significant increase in expression at  <dig> and  <dig> dppd . the stronger effect on ahkti expression produced by hd was consistent with the differential expression of trypsin inhibitor activity produced in leaves of a. hypochondriacus plantlets subjected to mechanical wounding or herbivory  <cit> . the induction of this gene in unwounded tissues, such as roots of hd  and md  plants, and stems of md plants  further supports the generation of a yet undefined wound induced signal needed for the systemic expression of this and most other genes analyzed in this study. defoliation also led to unexpectedly high levels of ahkti expression in panicles. also interesting was the delayed down-regulation of ahkti observed at  <dig> dppd in leaves of md plants. in contrast, atlox <dig> used as a marker of ja synthesis, was predominantly expressed in leaves of hd plants, although altered expression of this gene was also detected in roots, where md led to an early induction at  <dig> dppd, whereas hd repressed it . a clear repression of this gene was detected in stems of both hd and md plants at  <dig> dppd. the high expression of the ahlox <dig> gene in leaves of hd plants was somehow expected considering the well-established spike in ja levels that is usually produced when plants are attacked by leaf chewing herbivores in order to induce resistance or tolerance responses  <cit> . moreover, high atlox <dig> expression in leaves of hd plants, presumably leading to augmented ja levels, could have been a factor influencing the noticeable difference between gene expression between hd and md plants observed in this study. insect herbivory might have also impacted the stress signaling network through its effect on reactive oxygen species  synthesis and cellular redox metabolism  <cit> . likewise, the possible role of ja as a systemic signal for the distal induction of genes in hd plants is in agreement with data generated in a. hypochondriacus showing that jasmonates can modulate defense responses vs. insects  <cit>  and strongly induce the systemic expression of various herbivory-responsive genes including aoc, a ja biosynthetic gene  <cit> . it is important to notice that ja can also induce changes in resource allocation to enhance plant tolerance to defoliation  <cit> . however, the proposed signaling role of ja in resistance/ tolerance responses in grain amaranth remains to be determined.

different responses to insect herbivory and mechanical damage have been frequently reported in plants and are attributed to the inability to simulate insect herbivory by mechanical means, which often underestimate the damage produced by insect feeding. moreover, instantaneous removal of leaf tissue by mechanical means is markedly different from the slower tissue removal caused by insect mandibles. other subtle effects not generally recognized can be caused by trampling, defecating or the dispersal of pathogens by the herbivore  <cit> , whereas a well-defined determinant of response differentiation is the insect’s saliva. in this respect, it has been amply demonstrated that resistance signaling is elicited differently from simple wounding when herbivore-specific elicitors  contained in the insect’s saliva or oral secretions are introduced into wounds  <cit> .

changes in the expression of a senescence associated  gene as a marker of ageing and development in partially defoliated in a. cruentus
the expression of the ahsag gene, used as a marker of development and senescence, produced the expected pattern in leaves of hd plants, where a reduction/repression of its expression at  <dig> dppd was followed by clearly augmented levels at  <dig> and  <dig> dppd . a similar tendency, although weaker, was observed in leaves and stems md plants, whereas in stems of hd plants, the expression of the ahsag gene was strongly repressed. the early expression in roots of hd and md plants at  <dig> dppd suggests that this gene may be a systemic marker of wound stress and not development, in this tissue. this is supported by several reports showing that several genes that are up-regulated during senescence also accumulate in response to biotic and abiotic stress  <cit> . panicles of hd plants showed a very high expression of this gene. this was probably reflecting the accelerated onset of the flowering stage consistently observed in hd plants . the differential effect of hd and md on gene expression was again evidenced in stems, where a clearly contrasting effect on the expression of ahsag was observed at  <dig> dppd.

in addition to early flowering, hd reduced leaf longevity and increased branching . these changes, however, did not negatively affect plant height or seed yield in physiologically mature plants . these changes indicate that insect herbivory produced a stronger ontogenetic shift than mechanical wounding in grain amaranth. the difference was manifested by premature flowering  and the accelerated senescence of mature leaves. this is in partial agreement with a related study that found that clipping in a. cruentus produced drastic changes in plant architecture, and led to an overcompensation response that increased seed yield  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
grain amaranth plants are known to thrive under harsh ambient conditions that are inhospitable to other crops, particularly cereals. the mechanisms responsible for drought and saline stress resistance have been attributed to several physiological, biochemical and/ or genetic adaptations, including superior water use efficiency, changes in root length and architecture, the accumulation of compatible solutes and/ or the expression of key stress-related genes  <cit> . conversely, not much is known regarding the observed ability of grain amaranth to sustain defoliation. the nsc data obtained in this work showed that a single defoliation event in young grain amaranth plantlets led to a rapid reduction in nsc levels in both sink tissues and source leaves that recovered some time after defoliation. we propose that the rapid mobilization of foliar starch reserves followed by an efficient recovery of all nsc reserves supported the tolerance response to defoliation in grain amaranth, as manifested by unaltered plant growth and reproductive fitness. moreover, the long-term sequestration of starch in roots and stems that was observed when the starch levels in leaves were unusually high, together with the temporary accumulation of fatty acids in roots, suggest a plastic response to defoliation in grain amaranth. remarkably, only a few changes in gene expression and enzyme activity could be associated with the above changes. this outcome was in agreement with the highly complex nature of the cho metabolic flux in plants, over which individual genes are predicted to have only a limited influence, if any. also large differences in gene expression patterns were observed between hd and md plants, even though the responses of plants to both treatments were very similar. this could have been associated with the stronger ontogenetic shift caused insect herbivory, which was manifested by premature flowering, altered plant architecture and accelerated leaf senescence.

in accordance with this and other related studies, it can be concluded that a better understanding of how c partitioning influences tolerance to defoliation, and perhaps to other stresses including excessive salinity  <cit> , has a great potential for use in the future improvement of cultivated crops, particularly those that are stress and defoliation intolerant, such as maize.
