BACKGROUND
mobile genetic elements , which can transpose from one location to another within the genome, are known to be one of the causes of large scale genome reorganization  <cit> . according to the mechanism of their transposition, mges are usually classified into two broad categories: retroelements , which are transposed through the reverse transcription of an rna template , and dna transposons , which are transposed through a classical dna "cut-and-paste" transposition model. mges have attracted the attention of evolutionary biologists in studying their interactions with the host species  <cit> , especially in the post-genome era when more and more eukaryotic genomes are sequenced. the conventional approach to annotating mges in genomic sequences is based upon homology searching against a well-updated library of known mges, e.g. repbase  <cit> , using a fast searching program, e.g. repeatmasker  <cit> . this approach, however, is limited to annotating those known mge families, and thus cannot identify new elements. furthermore, it sometimes even overlooks known elements, because the repetitive nature of mge elements may confuse the statistical methods  that are commonly used in genome annotation  <cit> .

in a pioneer paper, bao and eddy described a de novo approach to automated annotation of repeat elements in a genome  <cit> . their program recon clustered blast hits from self-comparison of a single genome and reported the repeat elements that appear many times in similar copies in the genome. since then, several software tools have been developed with improved speed and performance over recon, e.g. repeatscout  <cit> , piler  <cit> , and a combined method  <cit> . all these methods described above, however, attempted to identify repeat elements based on their copy numbers in a genome, thus facilitating identification of general repeat elements. many mges indeed appear high copies in the host genome because of their transposition activity. but some mge families have low copy numbers in some genomes. furthermore, there exist other types of repeat elements than mges. for example, many low copy repeats  in mammalian genomes are induced by segmental duplications  <cit> . although these lcrs follow a completely different duplication mechanism from mges, there is often no clear distinction in copy numbers between these two classes of repeats. as a result, successful identification of new mges by these bioinformatics approaches requires subsequent manual inspection and experimental validation  <cit> . recently, a new computational method was proposed that identified genome-specifically inserted sequences using multiple alignment of closely related genomes  <cit> . this new method does not rely on the copy number of the repeat elements to identify them, but does not attempt to distinguish different classes of repeats either.

in this paper, we adopt a different de novo approach to identifying mobile genetic elements, which is based on common structural models of specific mge families, rather than their copy numbers in a genome. as an initial step of this approach, we concentrate on one class of mobile genetic elements, ltr-retrotransposons, which share a unique structural feature, two long terminal repeats  that are longer than  <dig> bp and play a key role in their transposition. ltr retrotransposons and endogenous retroviruses have partially overlapping gene organizations, and thus are thought to have the same origin. since two ltrs of a single ltr retrotransposon have identical sequences at the time of integration, dating the transposition event of a ltr retrotransposon can be achieved reliably by computing the sequence similarity of its two ltrs  <cit> . therefore, ltr retrotransposons become an ideal subject for phylogenetic analysis. computational screening of ltr retrotransposons has been done extensively in several eukaryotic genomes, e.g. c. elegans  <cit> , d. melanogaster  <cit> , mouse  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . software tools, such as ltr_struc  <cit> , and a newly developed one  <cit>  were developed to speed up the screening process. however, they were based on sequence characteristics derived from known ltr retroelements. because of the high divergence of ltr retrotransposons  <cit> , there are likely new elements still to be identified, even in these well-studied model organisms.

we propose here a de novo computational method for ltr retrotransposon identification that consists of three steps. in the first step, we identify only young and intact ltr retrotransposons, i.e. those elements associated with pairs of ltrs with high identity . this problem can be formulated as finding two highly similar subsequences with a distance ranging typically from  <dig> to  <dig> bases in a given genomic sequence. we used an approximate string matching technique, based on the suffix array data structure, to solve this problem. in addition, the structure of retroelements is inspected by the occurrences of common protein domains. in the second step, we identify solo ltrs, i.e. the unpaired ltrs resulting from recombination between ltr retrotransposons, by first applying the bag sequence clustering algorithm  <cit>  to cluster ltrs identified in the previous step, and then searching against the whole genome using sequence profile hidden markov models  built from these ltr sequence clusters. finally, we identify old and intact ltr retrotransposons with ltr pairs of low identities  by a phylogenetic analysis of identified ltr elements.

we implemented our method in a software package using c++ and perl, and tested it on two eukaryotic genomes, c. elegans and d. melanogaster. we chose these genomes for initial testing because they have been well studied so that we can compare our results with the previous known ones and those identified by ltr_struc  <cit> . it turns out that our de novo method identified almost all of the previously known elements, whereas ltr_struc missed about 1/ <dig> of them, although both methods report comparable number of retroelements. this indicates our method has a higher sensitivity over the existing method. in addition to known elements, our method identified some new intact ltr retrotransposons and several putative new families of ltr retrotransposons. these are particularly encouraging results, for these two genomes have been well studied. in order to obtain a larger evolutionary picture of their transpositions, we also analyzed two additional genomes, c. briggsae and d. pseudoobscura, each closely related to one of the two model genomes. from the phylogenetic analysis of the identified elements, we find clear evidence that some ltr retrotransposon families are specific to single species within a genus, whereas some others are active across both genomes. we also analyzed the distribution of chromosomal locations of identified ltr retrotransposons. consistent with previous reports, we observed that there were more ltr retrotransposons existing in heterochromatic regions than in euchromatic regions, implying that active mobile genetic elements might contribute significantly to the formation of heterochromatin.

RESULTS
identification of intact and solo ltr retroelements
following the algorithms described in the methods section, we implemented a program package for de novo ltr retrotransposon identification. we then applied our program to identify ltr retrotransposons in four genomes. totals of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> intact ltr retrotransposons were found in the c. elegans, c. briggsae, d. melanogaster, and d. pseudoobscura genomes, which were classified into  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> clusters, respectively . we note that these clusters represent putative families of retroelements. below we discuss the details of our findings in each of these four genomes.

comparison with existing methods
we first compared the results of our method with ltr_struc  <cit> , a widely applied program for ltr retroelements. figure  <dig> shows venn diagram of the known intact ltr retroelements  <cit> , and the intact retroelements identified by ltr_struc and our method in the c. elegans genome, respectively. the results show that both our method and ltr_struc report comparable number of retroelements . our method identified almost all  known intact ltr retroelements, whereas ltr_struc identified only  <dig> of them. the only missed known element, which is also missed by ltr_struc, is reported as two solo ltrs by our method. there are  <dig> common new elements identified by both methods. in contrast, each method identified a considerable number of new elements that are not identified by the other one , indicating that these two methods may be complementary in identifying new ltr retroelements. similar results are obtained when comparing both methods on the d. melanogaster genome. we constructed a reference set of putative intact retroelements in euchromatic regions based on the latest annotation in flybase  <cit> . since the intact and fragment elements are not distinguished in the annotation, we consider only  <dig> ones that are longer than  <dig> bp as putative intact elements. using only intact ltr retrotransposons in comparison, our method identified  <dig> elements in the reference set, whereas ltr_struct identified  <dig> retroelements, and  <dig> of them are in the reference set ). when comparison was made using both intact and solo ltr retrotransposons, our method identified  <dig> elements in the reference set. these results show that our method has higher sensitivity than ltr_struc. the missed elements by our method may not contain any ltr.

ltr retrotransposons in the c. elegans genome
a total of  <dig> pairs of young intact ltrs were found in the c. elegans genome after step  <dig> . the pairs of ltr sequences were then grouped into  <dig> clusters. a profile hmm was built for each cluster and subsequently searched against the whole genome and  <dig> solo ltrs were found at this step. next we applied the phylogenetic approach to identify old intact ltr retrotransposons.  <dig>  solo ltrs were paired at this step, which added  <dig> old intact ltr retrotransposons to the final result. in summary, we identified  <dig> intact ltr retrotransposons and  <dig> solo ltrs. the sequence identities between a pair of ltrs from intact retroelements were above  <dig> % with an average value of  <dig> %. the locations of these elements identified in the latest release  of the c. elegans genome sequence can be found in our complementary website. previous studies based on homology searching have identified  <dig> intact ltr retrotransposons in  <dig> families from the c. elegans genome  <cit> . these families were defined according to the similarity of common protein domains such as reverse transcriptase  or envelope protein . we successfully recovered  <dig> out of these  <dig> known intact ltr retrotransposons, and  <dig> out of  <dig> these known families . we note that our method is a de novo method that does not rely on a library of known elements. therefore, the recovery of known retroelements is encouraging, indicating our method has a satisfactory false negative rate. some of the previously known families correspond to one cluster in our findings, whereas in the other cases, two families are merged into a single cluster . this shows that our automatic sequence clustering algorithm can define families of ltr retroelements similarly to the previous phylogenetic analyses. nevertheless, through the rest of the paper, we still call the groups of ltr retroelements identified by our method clusters instead of families, implying that additional verification is required before some of them can be determined new ltr retrotransposon families. the only intact ltr retroelement that we missed is known to be an intact ltr retroelement of the family cer <dig>  that does not have either common protein domains or long orfs inside the element, which remains a hard case for any automatic identification method. our program reported this pair of ltrs as two solo ltrs in cluster ltr_ce <dig>  again because their sequences are not the most similar in the phylogenetic tree . two retrotransposon families that we missed  do not contain intact elements . we stress that as any other de nov method, our method focuses on the identification of intact elements and can identify solo elements only if there are intact elements from the same family present in the genome. solo-only families, however, may be discovered through a homology-based method using ltr sequences identified from intact elements in other genomes .

ltr retrotransposons in the c. briggsae vs. c. elegans genomes
a total of  <dig> pairs of intact ltrs were found in the c. briggsae genome after step  <dig>  the ltrs were clustered into  <dig> clusters, from which phmm searching identified  <dig> solo ltrs. using phylogenetic analyses in step  <dig>  two additional intact ltrs were redefined from  <dig>  solo ltrs. hence, in total, our method identified  <dig> intact elements and  <dig> solo ltrs . we emphasize that we identified more elements than the conventional method in the c. briggsae genome. the ucsc genome browser <cit>  has annotated the mges for the c. briggsae genome based on repeatmasker searching against updated repbase. there are only  <dig> fragmentary sequences from the previously known ltr retrotransposon family . however, all of them are shorter than the half-length of the known intact elements in this family. this result is also consistent with a similar cross-species analysis that we performed. when we used repeatmasker to annotate retroelements in c. briggsae based on a library of ltr elements in c. elegans, we got  <dig> hits, but most of them were short partial matching and no significant hit was found. this suggests that the conventional homology searching methods may fail to identify new ltr retroelements, even when a library of ltr retroelements from a closely related organism is used. in contrast, our method has identified many more elements, including several putative new families, again demonstrating the advantages of our de novo method. among these new elements, the largest cluster  contains five intact elements, in which the average identity between ltrs in the elements is above 98%. three other clusters contain two intact elements and the remaining clusters contain only one intact element. the predicted rt domains in retroelements from the c. briggsae genome were aligned with those from the c. elegans genome in order to verify these identified elements . based on the groups by phylogenetic analysis , seven rt domains from clusters ltr_cb <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in the c. briggsae genome were aligned along with rt domains from the known elements, ltr_ce <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  in the c. elegans genome ). rt domain from two retroelements, ltr_cb <dig> and ltr_cb <dig>  in the c. briggsae genome were aligned along with the known elements, ltr_ce <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  in the c. elegans genome, which also belong to the same group in the phylogenetic tree ). the aligned rt sequences from both genomes are well conserved, in particular in those osm regions, implying that these elements identified by our methods are likely true ltr retroelements.

the sequence-based ltr finding method, as described previously  <cit>  or used in step  <dig> in our program, may miss some old retroelements, i.e. those elements containing pairs of ltrs with lower identities. our phylogenetic analysis  may overcome this disadvantage and identify additional intact retroelements. for example, the intact ltr retroelements  in cluster ltr_ce <dig> from c. elegans , which was also identified by an homology searching method in previous studies  <cit> , was missed by step  <dig> in our method. however, this intact ltr was identified in step  <dig> of our program by phylogenetic analysis, because in this case the pair of ltrs was the closest neighbors on the phylogenetic tree of the entire ltr family , highlighted in gray box). another example is an intact ltr retroelement  in cluster ltr_ce <dig> in the c. elegans genome . in this cluster, one intact element  was identified in step  <dig>  whereas the other one  was missed in step  <dig>  but identified in step  <dig> since its pair of ltrs were the closest in the phylogenetic tree of the entire ltr family , highlighted in grey box).

we note that the number of elements identified in the c. briggsae genome is significantly less than in the c. elegans genome, even though these two genomes have similar genome size and gene content  <cit> . we hypothesize that this difference may be due to the fact that the c. briggsae genome is not fully finished. we used the following simulation experiment to test this hypothesis. we randomly shredded the sequence of the c. elegans genome into the same number  of scaffolds with identical lengths to those of the c. briggsae genome. we repeated this procedure  <dig> times and each time we determined how many identified intact elements in the c elegans genome were broken. we found that on average  <dig>  intact elements were retained , which is comparable to the number of intact elements identified in the c. briggsae genome . hence, we concluded that the c. briggsae genome may not contain significantly fewer intact ltr retroelements than the c. elegans genome, and that many elements may still be missing from the current analysis because of the incompleteness of its genomic sequence.

ltr retrotransposons in d. melanogaster genome
a total of  <dig> pairs of ltrs from young intact retroelements were identified in the d. melanogaster genome after step  <dig>  the pairs of ltr sequences were grouped into  <dig> clusters. searching against the whole genome based on the profile hmm of intact ltrs for each cluster, we identified  <dig> solo ltrs. in step  <dig>  the phylogenetic approach was applied and identified  <dig> old intact ltr retroelements from  <dig>  solo ltrs. hence, in summary, we identified  <dig>  intact ltrs and  <dig>  solo ltrs. these ltr retroelements were compared with previously identified families. a total of  <dig> ltr retrotransposon families in common were reported in four independent studies  <cit> . among  <dig> clusters that we identified,  <dig> clusters are equivalent to these  <dig> families. table  <dig> summarizes these  <dig> clusters together with some other clusters containing more than four intact retroelements. the cluster ltr_dm <dig> contains the largest number  of intact ltr elements. the average identity of ltr pairs from intact retroelements was  <dig> %. the cluster ltr_dm <dig> , contains  <dig> intact ltr retroelements. the identities between  <dig>  ltr pairs are above 99% and the average is  <dig> %.

ltr retrotransposons in the d. pseudoobscura vs. d. melanogaster genomes
a total of  <dig> pairs of intact ltr retrotransposons were identified after step  <dig> in the d. pseudoobscura genome. the ltrs thus obtained were clustered into  <dig> clusters, from which  <dig> solo ltrs were found. after phylogenetic analysis,  <dig> additional old intact ltr retroelements were identified from  <dig>  solo ltrs. in summary, we identified  <dig>  intact retrotransposons and  <dig>  solo ltrs . we identified far fewer ltr retroelements in the d. pseudoobscura genome than in the d. melanogaster genome. this is also understandable since the d. pseudoobscura genome is not as well finished as the d. melanogaster genome. in particular, almost no heterochromatic dna has been sequenced in this genome. in contrast, there is a well-progressed finishing effort for the d. melanogaster genome, particularly in heterochromatic regions. as we show below, in the d. melanogaster genome, a major fraction of the ltr retroelements were identified in heterochromatic regions. nevertheless, we can still identify many putative ltr retroelements in euchromatic regions of the d. pseudoobscura genome. for example, in cluster ltr_dp <dig>  two intact ltr retroelements were identified in step  <dig>  the identities between the pairs of ltrs are  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the identity between these two elements is  <dig> %.

chromosomal distribution of ltr retroelements
the analysis of chromosomal distributions of the identified ltr retroelements was performed on the c. elegans and d. melanogaster genomes. the kolmogorov-smirnov test was used to determine whether the ltrs are distributed uniformly in terms of their chromosomal location. with the significance level of  <dig> , the hypothesis of a uniform distribution was clearly rejected in chromosomes i, ii, v, and x of the c. elegans genome ; whereas the significance level on chromosomes iii and iv were p =  <dig>  and p =  <dig> , respectively. these results were consistent with the previous observations on the same genome  <cit>  and the dna replication model for the c. elegans genome  <cit> .

the same test was performed for four chromosomes  in the d. melanogaster genome. the results showed that the hypothesis was rejected in all four chromosomes. as shown in figure  <dig>  ltrs are more densely distributed in the pericentromeric regions of the chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  which are also considered to be highly heterochromatic regions. the chromosome x has more ltrs on one end. it was determined that 47% and 39% of the ltrs  are located in the proximal  <dig> mb of the pericentromeric regions of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. similarly, 44% of the ltrs are located in the proximal  <dig> mb of the pericentromeric regions of chromosome x. in order to see whether ltr retroelements are distributed uniformly in euchromatic regions, the test was carried out with the same hypothesis after excluding  <dig> mb of the pericentromeric regions of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  the result showed that the hypothesis was still rejected in these two chromosomes, indicating that there might be regions for more ltr retroelement insertions even in euchromatic regions.

phylogenetic analysis of rt domains
we used the rt domains in ltr retroelements to analyze the phylogenetic relationships of the ltr retroelements from two close species, c. elegans and c. briggsae. the elements that were identified by our method can be divided into two groups. one group has a known rt domain whereas the other one has long orfs  that may represent novel rt domains. from the elements identified in the first group of the c. elegans and the c. briggsae genomes, the rt protein sequences were extracted. their neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree with  <dig> bootstraps was generated . the tree contains three major groups, of which two groups contain known elements. group a in figure  <dig> contains elements in clusters ltr_ce1- <dig>  which are compatible with cer 1– <dig> in gypsy/ty <dig> group from the previous study  <cit>  and the new elements in clusters ltr_cb <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of the c. briggsae genome. group b in figure  <dig> contains elements in clusters ltr_ce 7– <dig>  which are compatible with cer 8– <dig> in bel group from the previous study  <cit>  and the new elements in clusters ltr_cb <dig> and  <dig> of the c. briggsae genome. the third group c contains new elements in the c. elegans genome and c. briggsae genome. we note that this preliminary analysis needs to be analyzed further based on retroelements identified in multiple genomes.

a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was also generated for the rt domains identified by our method in ltr retroelements from d. melanogaster and d. pseudoobscura . interestingly, the bootstrap support value is greater than 50% in most of the branches except those in the bottom. the clusters  are located in the group of clusters from d. melanogaster. one group  contains clusters only from the d. pseudoobscura genome while two other groups  are mixed of clusters from both genomes.

CONCLUSIONS
we proposed a novel computational method for de novo identification of ltr retrotransposons in eukaryotic genomes. it has been applied to several complete eukaryotic genomes and identified many new putative intact ltr retroelements, among which a few new potential families were discovered.
