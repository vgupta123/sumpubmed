BACKGROUND
chinese commercial tea is classified as green, oolong, black, white, yellow and dark teas, according to the manufacturing process used. fuzhuan brick tea is a type of dark tea that has been produced for more than  <dig> years  <cit> . the production of fuzhuan brick tea exceeded  <dig> billion yuan in  <dig>  and it is very popular in china and north-eastern asia.

fuzhuan brick tea involves microbial fermentation, which exerts a major effect on its organoleptic qualities and health properties  <cit> . various fungal taxa are important during the production of fuzhuan brick tea, which is produced under controlled temperature and moisture conditions  <cit> . aspergillus, eurotium and penicillium species are the main fungal taxa isolated during fermentation. aspergillus cristatus is the dominant taxon, termed the “golden flower fungus” because of its yellow cleistothecium colour   <cit> .fig.  <dig> sexual and asexual morphs of aspergillus cristatus. a, i dissecting microscopy; b-h, j-p scanning electron microscopy. sexual morph: colony phenotype in  <dig>  m nacl , ascogonium during the early and late stages , cleistothecium , ascus and ascospore . asexual morph: colony phenotype in  <dig> m nacl , conidiophores during the early and late stages , conidia 



aspergilli have served as model organisms in genetic studies because of their multifaceted life cycle  <cit> . the majority of aspergillus species  reproduce only asexually, whilst those that exhibit sexual cycles are overwhelmingly homothallic in nature, there are few heterothallic species  <cit> . aspergilli are considered good candidates for genetic studies of reproduction in fungi  <cit> . in the classical era of genetics, the optimal method of identifying gene function was screening for mutants that exhibit defective phenotypes related to their function. however, isolation of sexual reproduction mutants was problematic because of the priority production of conidia  <cit> . a range of genes involved in sexual reproduction have been identified in several aspergillus species  <cit> .

aspergillus can develop asexual or sexual spores depending on growth conditions. high concentrations of salts, such as sodium chloride or potassium chloride, induce asexual reproduction but inhibit sexual spore formation in aspergilli  <cit> . osmotic pressure also plays a key role in a. cristatus sporogenesis  <cit> . aspergillus cristatus reproduces sexually only when grown in tea bricks and during culture in hypo-osmolar medium . increased osmotic pressure results in greater numbers of asexual spores and fewer sexual spores. in ≥ <dig> m nacl conditions, only asexual conidia are produced , and sexual reproduction is completely inhibited. aspergillus cristatus employs different sexual and asexual reproductive strategies under different salt stress conditions, providing a robust genetic system for the study of eukaryotic sex development and cell biology.

fuzhuan brick-tea is produced only in china  <cit> . as it is popular with certain ethnic groups in china and northeastern asia, it is important to establish that a. cristatus does not produce carcinogenic mycotoxins, because this fungus dominates the fermentation process during brick-tea production. many aspergillus species produce mycotoxins by means of the mycotoxin pathway gene cluster, which comprises several genes . most of the clusters contain one or several central biosynthesis genes encoding extremely large, multidomain, multimodular enzymes belonging to the polyketide synthases  or non-ribosomal peptide synthetases   <cit> . consequently, in this study, we focused on analysing the relationships between mycotoxin gene clusters and end products.

in this paper, we investigated the relationship between the hog pathway and osmotic pressure, verified the safety of a. cristatus under low- and high-osmotic pressure conditions, and established the evolutionary patterns of the mating-type genes through genome sequencing and rna-seq transcriptomic data from a. cristatus at two developmental stages. this is the first high-quality genome sequence of a. cristatus to be published and the first report of its safety using genomic data mining. this study may serve as a model for further investigations of the relationship between osmotic pressure and reproduction mode.

RESULTS
genome sequencing and assembly
the genome of a. cristatus was sequenced using a whole-genome shotgun approach. a total of  <dig>  mb raw sequence data were generated from the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform at bgi-shenzhen. after filtering, the total assembly size of the genome of a. cristatus was  <dig>  mb, which was assembled into  <dig> contigs and  <dig> scaffolds, with an n <dig> length of  <dig>  mb . with the exception of a. clavatus, a. rambellii and a. ruber, the genome of a. cristatus is smaller than other sequenced aspergillus genomes  <cit>  .fig.  <dig> circular representation of the aspergillus cristatus genome. the following data are shown : a size of scaffolds >  <dig> kb. b differential expression as the log <dig> ratio of expression at high salinity , with increased expression in red and decreased expression in green. c gc content of each scaffold. d locations of transposable elements. e gene duplications and links. linked locations were determined by aligning the predicted proteins to the genome using exonerate   <cit> 



gene prediction and annotation
a total of  <dig>  genes were predicted via ab initio and homology-based analyses. the gene density was  <dig>  kb per gene, which is higher than those of other sequenced aspergillus species . in a. cristatus, the annotated coding regions accounted for  <dig>  % of the genome, with an average coding length of  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  exons per gene; the average exon length was  <dig> bp. the overall gc content was  <dig>  %, while the average gc content of the open reading frames was  <dig>  % .

gene ontology analysis categorised the gene set into  <dig> functional groups. subsets of these functional groups were annotated within the “mating projection” category. kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes  analysis was used to assign  <dig>  genes to  <dig> pathways  <cit> . thirteen genes were predicted to be involved in the hog signalling pathway, with the exception of sln <dig>  which controls adaptation to different osmolarities  <cit>  .table  <dig> hog map-kinase pathway genes in aspergillus cristatus and the expression under different osmolarities

phylogenetic relationships
the phylogenetic relationships between filamentous fungi have been established based on ribosomal dna sequences or single-gene families  <cit> . we selected a set of  <dig>  single-copy predicted orthologous genes from a. cristatus and  <dig> sequenced genes from filamentous fungi. these orthologous genes were used to construct a maximum-likelihood tree . penicillium marneffei was used as an outgroup taxon to root the tree. the topology  of this tree was consistent with previous reports  <cit> . aspergillus cristatus, a. glaucus and a. ruber clustered within the same clade, indicating closer genetic relationships than that with a. nidulans . the teleomorph of three species are eurotium spp., and they are homothallic. these microorganisms are widely distributed in the natural environment, can adapt to high concentrations of sodium chloride and other ions, and thus are a valuable resource for investigation of stress resistance mechanisms  <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationships among aspergillus genomes. the grey rectangle represents the clade in which aspergillus cristatus is located. a total of  <dig>  single copy orthologous proteins were concatenated and a phylogenetic tree constructed using the raxml  <dig> . <dig> software  <cit> , with the best model, which was simulated with prottest  <dig>   <cit> ,  <dig> bootstrap replicates were used



sex and evolution of mating-type loci
sexual reproduction in ascomycetes is governed by two mating-type genes: one gene encodes a protein with an alpha-box domain , and the other encodes a protein with a high mobility group  domain   <cit> . the sexual development of the genus aspergillus is mainly homothallic, and the two mating-type genes are located on different chromosomes  <cit> . heterothallic fungi have only one mating-type gene and require a partner with a different mating-type gene. the two mating-type genes of heterothallic fungi typically occupy the same chromosomal location in different haploid genomes but are not obviously related in terms of structure or common descent; these genes are termed idiomorphs  <cit> .

two models for the evolution of the mat locus in aspergilli have been proposed . the first model is evolution of heterothallism from homothallism  <cit> . the second model is evolution of homothallism from heterothallism  <cit> . in the first model, the shared homothallic ancestor included two adjacent genes , which are flanked by the sla <dig> and apn <dig> genes. the alpha box and hmg domain genes in one lineage were located on different chromosomes flanked by either the sla <dig> or apn <dig> gene through chromosomal breakage, resulting in heterothallic species. in addition, the ancestor evolved into heterothallic species with an alpha box or hmg domain gene at the same locus due to chromosomal segregation and gene loss. in the second model, the shared heterothallic ancestor contained either the alpha box or the hmg domain gene at the same locus, flanked by the sla <dig> and apn <dig> genes. the alpha box and hmg genes of the ancestor separated to different chromosomes flanked by the sla <dig> and apn <dig> genes, respectively, due to chromosomal breakage, translocation and rearrangement, resulting in the evolution of homothallic species. moreover, when the ancestor underwent gene duplication and chromosomal translocation, it evolved into other homothallic species , which contained the alpha box domain gene at the original loci flanked by sla <dig> and apn <dig>  while the hmg gene was located at a separate locus flanked by dsla <dig> and dapn <dig>  which are pseudogenes of sla <dig> and apn <dig>  respectively  <cit> . the sequence upstream of the n. fischeri mat <dig> locus contains numerous regions with sequence similarity to transposase genes from other fungi.

the annotation results of the a. cristatus genome showed that mat1-1- <dig>  and mat1-2- <dig>  are distributed in scaffolds  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the blastp analysis indicated that these genes are present as a single copy in the a. cristatus genome. fgenesh + analysis suggested that mat1-1- <dig> contains two exons and an alpha-box sequence and encodes  <dig> amino acid residues, while mat1-2- <dig> contains three exons and one hmg-box sequence and encodes  <dig> amino acid residues. the conserved amino acid sequences of the two genes were subject to a blast search against those of other aspergillus species using jalview version  <dig>   <cit>  . the results demonstrated that mat genes are conserved in a. cristatus.

blast analysis of the flanking regions of a. cristatus mat 1-2- <dig> revealed the presence of putative cytoskeleton assembly control  and dna lyase  genes upstream and downstream of mat 1-2- <dig>  respectively. the upstream and downstream regions of the a. cristatus mat  <dig> locus exhibit collinearity with the upstream and downstream regions of the mat  <dig> locus of n. fischeri . however, analysis of the flanking genes of the a. cristatus mat <dig> locus showed that these genes have no homology to sla <dig> and apn <dig> . the sequences flanking the a. cristatus mat <dig> locus encode proteins that have no homology with sla <dig> and apn1; therefore, these loci were termed nsla <dig> and napn <dig> to distinguish them from sla <dig> and apn <dig> . in addition, the sequences upstream and downstream of the a. cristatus mat <dig> locus did not encode transposase genes with similarity to those of other fungi. these results indicated that the evolutionary model of the mat loci of a. cristatus is different from those of other aspergillus species, possibly due to gene translocation breakage and insertion . this model supports the evolution of homothallism from heterothallism.fig.  <dig> comparison of aspergillus mat loci. coding regions are indicated by arrows, with the direction of the arrow denoting the direction of transcription. a the aspergillus cristatus mat-hmg locus is co-linear with other aspergillus mat loci. red genes show orthologs from the left flank  of the a. nidulans alpha locus with the left flanks of a. oryzae, n. fischeri and a. cristatus loci. blue genes indicate orthologs to the right flank of the a. nidulans hmg locus. genes labelled and outlined in black are associated with mat loci in other fungi. b the a. cristatus mat-alpha locus has no collinearity with any other aspergillus species. the red gene indicates the mat-alpha gene of a. cristatus

mapk signalling transduction
the cell surface and nucleus of eukaryotic cells receive and respond to environmental signals via the mapk pathway, which is a highly conserved eukaryotic signal transduction system  <cit> . this pathway orchestrates cell growth, morphogenesis and cell division in response to hormones, stress and other abiotic signals  <cit> . in the model yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, four signalling pathways are associated with the mapk pathway: the pheromone pathway, the hypotonic pathway, the high-osmolarity pathway and the starvation pathway. among these, the hog pathway is involved in responses to osmotic pressure, and its activation depends on the induction of several genes in response to increased osmotic pressure  <cit> .

in s. cerevisiae, the hog pathway includes two branches: the sln1-branch and the sho1-branch. regulation of these branches converges on the mapk kinase  pbs <dig>  <cit> . under normal conditions, sln <dig>  a sensor histidine kinase, is constitutively activated by autophosphorylation and subsequently phosphorylates the phosphotransfer protein ypd <dig>  which, in turn, transfers phosphate to the ssk <dig> response regulator. ssk <dig> is phosphorylated and inactive under low-osmolarity conditions, which blocks activation of the pbs <dig> mapkk-hog <dig> mapk system. in response to stress, the two-component phosphorelay system is rapidly repressed, resulting in the activation of ssk <dig> and ssk <dig>  which activate pbs <dig> and hog <dig>  <cit> . under high-osmolarity conditions, sho <dig>  which contains four transmembrane domains and a carboxy-terminal sh <dig> domain, utilises ste <dig> and ste <dig> to activate the mapkk kinase ste <dig>  which then activates pbs <dig>  <cit> . pbs <dig> then phosphorylates the mapk hog <dig>  resulting in the translocation of hog <dig> into the nucleus and induction of the transcription of a large number of genes, some of which are responsible for glycerol production  <cit> .

as in s. cerevisiae, the hoga  pathway of a. nidulans is activated in an osmotic and oxidative manner  <cit> . interestingly, a saka-null mutant showed only slight sensitivity to high osmolarity stress, and pbsb  in a. nidulans lacks the pro-rich motif necessary for binding to sho1p. this indicates that osmo-regulation in a. nidulans differs from that in yeast  <cit> .

a. cristatus can grow and develop under both low- and high-osmolarity conditions; moreover, most hog pathway genes in s. cerevisiae have homologs in the a. cristatus genome, with the exception of sln <dig>  therefore, we hypothesised that the expression of components of the hog mapk cascade pathway would respond to a change in osmotic pressure. to test this hypothesis, we used rna-seq to compare gene expression levels in a. cristatus cultured in  <dig>  m nacl  and  <dig> m nacl . interestingly, there was no significant change in the level of expression of most key genes in the hog pathway—such as sho <dig>  hog <dig>  and ste20—between high and low osmotic pressure conditions , indicating that the hog mapk cascade pathway is not involved in the response to changes in the osmotic pressure of the medium from hypotonic  to hypertonic . thus, other mechanisms, such as protein modifications, might be involved in the response to changes in osmotic pressure  <cit> .fig.  <dig> expression of hog mapk pathway genes according to osmolarity. thirteen genes of the hog pathway are shown, and background colour changes from blue to red indicate changes in log <dig> fpkm values  of gene expression levels under low and high osmolarity conditions. numbers at right, such as si65_01337/ctt <dig>  are gene ids or names. treatment conditions are detailed beneath the images



mycotoxin gene cluster analysis and mycotoxin detection
mycotoxins are important because they can affect human health  <cit> . mycotoxins are produced by various filamentous ascomycetes, especially members of the genera aspergillus and fusarium, through well-defined biosynthetic pathways. this issue is relevant to a. cristatus because of its ‘generally recognised as safe’ status and its use in the production of fuzhuan brick tea. the biosynthetic genes and pathways for six mycotoxins  were searched in the genome . aspergillus cristatus contains  <dig> secondary metabolite gene clusters . several backbone enzymes of the mycotoxin gene clusters, which were predicted by antismash  <cit> , are orthologs of the backbone enzymes of some mycotoxin gene clusters . the genome contains  <dig> nrps- and  <dig> pks-encoding genes, most of which are located in clusters. as shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>   <dig> potential homologs of mycotoxin biosynthetic genes were found in the a. cristatus genome using blastp and inparanoid  <dig>   <cit> . it should be noted that in all cases, the homologs of mycotoxin biosynthetic genes are not located in mycotoxin gene clusters . none of the predicted gene clusters showed collinearity with known mycotoxin gene clusters. thus, there are no known mycotoxin biosynthetic gene clusters in the a. cristatus genome.table  <dig> secondary metabolism gene clusters in aspergillus cristatus




in general, the biosynthesis genes for fungal secondary metabolites are located in clusters  <cit> ; however, the mycotoxin genes in a. crastatus were not found located in clusters. moreover, transcription data showed that most of the mycotoxin genes are expressed at low and high osmotic pressure . this result suggested that a. crastatus might produce mycotoxins during culture under low and high osmolarity conditions. to confirm this, we assayed six mycotoxins by high performance liquid chromatography . only fumonisin b <dig> was detected at  <dig>  and  <dig>  ppm at low and high osmolarities, respectively. however, this is lower than the standard  set by the us food and drug administration   <cit>  . these data suggest that the strain is safe under low- and high-osmolarity conditions, and the locations of the mycotoxin genes did not provide information regarding mycotoxin production by the fungus.

CONCLUSIONS
comparison of the mat loci of a. cristatus with those of other aspergillus species revealed that the evolution of the a. cristatus mat locus differs from those of other aspergillus species. the findings regarding the aspergillus mat loci supported the evolution of homothallism from heterothallism. the majority of sex-related components identified in other ascomycetes are also present in a. cristatus. the initial analysis of the evolution of the mat loci, associated with sex-related components, provides information for further investigation of sexual development in a. cristatus.

the components of the hog pathway were conserved in a. cristatus. gene expression analysis demonstrated that the hog pathway of a. cristatus was not involved in the response to high osmotic pressure. thus, a. cristatus may respond to high osmolarity stress via mechanisms other than the hog pathway.

a mycotoxin gene cluster collinearity analysis indicated that the mycotoxin biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for production of six toxins were not present in the a. cristatus genome. an hplc assay indicated that the strain is safe under low- and high-osmolarity conditions; moreover, the locations of the mycotoxin genes did not provide information regarding mycotoxin production by this fungus.
