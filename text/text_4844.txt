BACKGROUND
arfs are small, ubiquitous, ras-related gtpases that play an essential role in membrane traffic and structure. among the  <dig> mammalian arf proteins, arf <dig> has been implicated in the regulation of endocytic membrane traffic and cortical actin structure at the plasma membrane   <cit> . the small gtpases of the rho subfamily are also known to be important regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. to date, at least  <dig> rho family proteins have been identified and of these, rhoa, rac <dig> and cdc <dig> have been the most widely studied for their effects on actin organization. in particular, rac <dig> controls the formation of lamellipodia and membrane ruffles, the sites of protrusive actin polymerization and early adhesion formation initiated at the leading edge of migrating cells  <cit> .

recent studies have uncovered crosstalk between these  <dig> families, in which both arf <dig> and rac proteins have emerged as key regulators in actin remodeling and membrane trafficking events  <cit> . we showed that rac <dig> colocalizes with arf <dig> at the plasma membrane and recycling endosomes, and that rac1-stimulated ruffling requires arf <dig> activity  <cit> . stimulation of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor in mdck cells  <cit>  or the angiotensin ii receptor in hek cells  <cit> leads to the sequential activation of arf <dig> and then rac. on the other hand, during platelet activation arf6-gtp levels decrease, followed by activation of rho gtpases  <cit> . santy and casanova showed that activation of arf <dig> by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor  arno leads to the subsequent activation of rac  <cit> . recently, these investigators found that expression of a dominant negative form of dock180/elmo, a rac gef, inhibited arno activation of rac suggesting that this rac gef may couple arno activities to rac activation  <cit> .

like other gtpases, both arf and rho proteins are regulated by cycling between active, gtp-bound and inactive, gdp-bound conformations. this cycle is regulated by gefs that catalyze exchange of gtp for gdp and gtpase-activating proteins  that catalyze gtp hydrolysis. these regulators control the activation of these gtpases spatially and temporally. rho family gefs have a dbl homology  domain, a conserved amino acid sequence that is the catalytic domain. many dbl family gefs also contain other protein-protein interaction domains that allow gtpases to be activated in specific signal transduction pathways and coordinate more elaborate responses to specific demands at localized cellular sites  <cit> .

in the present study, we identified kalirin, a rho family gef, as a specific arf <dig> binding protein. kalirin, a novel member of the dbl family, is a multi-domain protein with many isoforms in rat adult brain tissues as determined by northern blot analysis  <cit> . kalirin <dig> is the shortest protein of the kalirin isoforms, containing  <dig> spectrin-like repeats , a dbl homology  domain, a pleckstrin homology  domain, and a pdz binding motif. kalirin is highly homologous to trio, which is more widely expressed  <cit> . here we provide evidence that arf6-gdp can bind to kalirin through interaction with these spectrin repeats, thereby recruiting kalirin to the membrane leading to rac activation.

RESULTS
arf6-gdp binds to kalirin via the spectrin repeats
to identify proteins that interact with arf <dig>  we used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human fetal brain library. one clone was identified that contained the spectrin repeat  domain  <dig> of kalirin, a novel member of the dbl family of rho gefs. there are multiple splice forms of kalirin family gefs, the longest of which is kalirin <dig>  a dual rho gef homologous to trio  <cit> . in both kalirin and trio, the first dh-ph motif activates rac and rhog while the second activates rho   <cit> . both kalirin <dig>  and kalirin <dig>  lack the second dh-ph motif, terminating with a pdz motif; kalirin <dig> lacks the sec <dig> and first four spectrin repeats of kalirin <dig>  <cit> . we examined whether we could detect a specific interaction of kalirin <dig> and its sr with arf <dig> by a gst pull-down assay. cos <dig> cells were transfected with ha-tagged arf <dig>  arf <dig> or arf <dig> and the lysates were incubated with spectrin-like repeats 4â€“ <dig> of rat kalirin <dig>  fused to gst  <cit> . arf <dig> bound to gst-kalsr4- <dig> but not to gst alone . moreover, neither arf <dig> nor arf <dig> bound to gst-kalsr4- <dig> 

we then examined the interaction between kalirin <dig> and arf <dig> in cells expressing flag-tagged kalirin and various ha-tagged arf proteins by immunoprecipitation of flag-kalirin. wild type arf <dig> and the gtp-binding defective mutant of arf <dig>  co-immunoprecipitated with kalirin <dig> but a constitutively active mutant of arf <dig>  did not . neither arf <dig> nor arf <dig> co-precipitated with kalirin, consistent with the results in the gst pull-down assays. similar results were obtained when arf proteins were immunoprecipitated with antibody to ha and the immunoprecipitates probed for kalirin <dig> . since cells expressing arf <dig> will have both gdp and gtp-bound forms, whereas cells expressing arf6t27n will have only the gdp-bound form of arf <dig>  these results suggest that kalirin <dig> binds to the gdp-bound, and not the gtp-bound, form of arf <dig>  although we could see this interaction following over-expression of arf <dig> and kalirin, we were not able to detect it with endogenous proteins; this may be due to low levels of expression, difficulty extracting the proteins in a native state and lack of sensitive immunological reagents.

to confirm this arf6-gdp-specific interaction, we co-expressed arf <dig> and kalirin <dig> with efa <dig>  an arf <dig> gef that will lead to an increase in arf6-gtp  <cit>  and hence a decrease in arf6-gdp in cells. co-expression of efa <dig> decreased the amount of arf <dig> recovered in the kalirin <dig> immunoprecipitate . secondly, lowering atp and gtp levels in cells by treatment with sodium deoxyglucose and sodium azide, used previously by others  <cit> , led to a time-dependent increase in arf <dig> and kalirin <dig> binding . enhanced arf <dig> binding to sr <dig> in the gst-spectrin pull down assays was also observed when cells were depleted of energy as above . similar co-immunoprecipitation results were obtained from transfected hela cells . we also attempted co-immunoprecipitation of larger kalirin-like isoforms  but were unsuccessful due to a very low efficiency of transfection of these large sr-containing gefs. from these results, we conclude that kalirin <dig> can bind specifically to arf6-gdp.

trio has a similar domain structure to that of kalirin   <cit> . in particular, the amino acid identity between trio and kalirin in their spectrin repeat regions is high; the sr <dig> regions are 69% identical. since trio is expressed in hela cells  <cit> , we examined whether arf <dig> could interact with trio via its sr region. arf <dig> interacted with gst-trio sr5- <dig> and co-expression of efa <dig> diminished this interaction . additionally, we did not see any arf <dig> binding to trio sr <dig> . thus, sr <dig> may represent a specific domain for interaction with arf6-gdp and trio function may also be regulated by arf <dig> 

arf <dig> regulates the cellular localization of kalirin5
having shown that kalirin <dig> binds specifically to arf6-gdp in vitro, we next examined the intracellular distribution of kalirin <dig> and various spectrin repeat constructs in transfected hela cells. we used hela cells to assess the distribution of these proteins and their effects on cell morphology because we have a good understanding of arf <dig> and rac function in these cells  <cit> . expression of flag-tagged kalirin <dig> alone induced modest ruffling . kalirin <dig> was observed at the pm and also diffusely throughout the cytoplasm. kalirin5-induced ruffling was dependent upon rac <dig> since coexpression with rac1t17n inhibited ruffling . expression of sr <dig> or arf <dig> alone did not cause pm ruffling . co-expression of arf <dig> with kalirin <dig> greatly enhanced the formation of membrane ruffles , consistent with previous observations that rac1-mediated ruffling is enhanced by arf <dig> expression in hela cells  <cit> . we also observed that arf <dig> co-expression increased the association of kalirin with the pm, where the two proteins colocalized and decreased the cytoplasmic pool of kalirin . when expressed alone in hela cells, sr <dig> was primarily cytoplasmic , but co-expression with arf <dig> recruited sr <dig> to the pm where it colocalized with arf <dig> .

this increased membrane association of kalirin in the presence of arf <dig> expression was also shown by subcellular fractionation; cos <dig> cells, which show a higher co-transfection rate than do hela cells, were used for these studies. while only about 7% of kalirin <dig> was associated with the membrane fraction when expressed alone, this amount nearly doubled when arf <dig> was co-expressed .

when arf6t27n was expressed with kalirin <dig>  ruffling was inhibited and the amount of kalirin <dig> at the pm was reduced. kalirin colocalized with arf6t27n on the tubular endosomal membranes , previously shown to carry recycling membrane cargo such as mhci back to the pm  <cit> . the pm localization of sr <dig> was also diminished in cells expressing arf6t27n ; sr <dig> was, instead, colocalized with arf6t27n on tubular endosomal membranes . in contrast to its recruitment to membranes in cells expressing arf6t27n, kalirin <dig> was less evident at the pm in cells coexpressing efa <dig>  which causes an increase in arf6-gtp . the recruitment of kalirin to membranes by expression of the gdp-bound mutant of arf <dig> , and not by expression of efa <dig>  supports the biochemical interaction data between arf6-gdp and kalirin <dig> . similar results were observed in cos <dig> cells .

arf <dig> affects rac <dig> activity through kalirin5
since kalirin5-induced ruffling was dependent upon rac <dig> in hela cells, we examined whether we could detect rac activation in a pull-down assay using the crib domain of pak <dig> fused to gst  <cit> . total cell lysates from cells expressing au5-tagged rac <dig> were incubated with gst-pak-crib and bound rac <dig>  was detected by immunoblotting. no rac1-gtp was detected in cells expressing rac <dig> plus sr5- <dig> and this did not change with co-expression of arf <dig> . co-expression of kalirin <dig>  however, led to detectable rac1-gtp that was increased further upon co-expression of arf <dig>  in contrast, co-expression of arf6t27n diminished the ability of kalirin <dig> to activate rac <dig> . even though the extent of rac <dig> activation was modest, likely due to low efficiency of co-expression, these results suggest that wild type arf <dig> enhances the ability of kalirin <dig> to activate rac <dig> whereas an arf <dig> mutant that cannot be activated, arf6t27n, diminishes kalirin <dig> activation of rac <dig> 

finally, to support a model whereby arf <dig> affects rac activation through recruitment of an endogenous sr-containing gef, possibly trio, in hela cells, we examined whether a dominant inhibitory mutant in the dh domain of kalirin <dig>   <cit>  could block the alterations in the cytoskeleton induced by efa <dig>  an arf <dig> gef. expression of efa <dig> leads to protrusive cells with a marked increase in cortical actin and marked decrease in stress fibers ; this response requires activation of arf <dig> and subsequent activation of rac  <cit> . co-expression of mutant kalirin <dig>  blocked these changes in cell shape and actin polymerization normally observed in cells expressing efa <dig>  whereas co-expression of wild type kalirin <dig> with efa <dig> did not inhibit efa <dig> pm ruffling . cells with stress fibers, scored by exhibition of radial fibers crossing the cell center, were observed in only 20% of efa <dig> expressing cells but this was increased to 70% in cells co-expressing the kalirin <dig> mutant . this is similar to the 85% frequency of cells exhibiting radial stress fibers in untransfected cells . we could not measure the expected decrease in efa6-induced rac activation biochemically in the presence of gef-dead kalirin <dig> due to the low frequency of cells expressing all three proteins.

discussion
many studies have demonstrated a role for arf <dig> activity in rac-mediated membrane ruffling and cytoskeletal reorganization at the pm. arf <dig> may facilitate the trafficking of rac <dig> to the pm  <cit>  and arf <dig> activation may lead to the activation of rac <dig>  <cit> . however, the details of how arf <dig> influences rac functions remain to be elucidated. a recent study by santy et al has shown that the arno activation of arf <dig> that leads to the activation of rac in mdck cells may be mediated by the dock180/elmo complex however, no direct interaction between arno or arf <dig> and dock180/elmo was described  <cit> . in the present study, we describe a possible mechanism for how arf <dig> could regulate rac <dig> activity by showing the interaction between arf6-gdp and kalirin <dig>  a rac/rhog gef.

kalirin <dig> is the smallest isoform in the kalirin family. the amino terminal end of the protein begins at spectrin repeat  <dig>  and includes the dbl homology  and pleckstrin homology  domains and a pdz-binding motif in the c-terminal region . most of the alternatively spliced isoforms of both kalirin and trio include these spectrin-like repeats  <cit> . interestingly, these spectrin repeats are also sites of interaction of kalirin with pam, a secretory granule enzyme required for the Î±-amidation of peptides  <cit> , with i-nos  <cit> , and with huntingtin-associated protein  <dig>   <cit> . since the larger kalirin isoforms all contain sr <dig>  they could interact with arf6-gdp in a manner similar to kalirin <dig>  we do not know whether this binding is direct or involves other proteins.

what then could be the function of arf6-gdp binding to kalirin? we propose that the kalirin interaction with arf6-gdp is transient but brings kalirin to membranes. the subsequent activation of arf <dig> then allows kalirin to activate rac. consistent with this, co-expression of wild type arf <dig>  which can cycle between gdp-and gtp-bound forms, increases the pm localization of kalirin <dig>  the steady state level of rac1-gtp, and the ability of kalirin <dig> to induce membrane ruffling. arf6t27n, however, being trapped in the gdp-bound state, recruits kalirin <dig> to endosomal membranes but fails to allow activation of rac through kalirin. on the other hand, efa <dig> promotes activation of arf <dig> but still allows inactivation, generating arf6-gdp. when efa <dig> is expressed, kalirin does not stably associate with the pm but it may transiently be brought to the pm by arf6-gdp to activate rac. the ability of gef dead kalirin <dig> to block efa6-induced cytoskeletal changes  is supportive of this model and suggests that a spectrin repeat-containing gef might be responsible for rac activation in efa <dig> expressing cells.

kalirin brought to the membrane through its interaction with arf6-gdp could be positioned for optimal access to rac <dig>  additionally, the interaction of arf <dig> with sr <dig> of kalirin could allosterically activate its gef activity. in either case, the interaction of arf <dig> with kalirin provides a way to couple the arf <dig> activation/inactivation cycle to that of a rho gtpase. the sequential recruitment of kalirin by arf6-gdp, followed by activation of arf <dig> and then activation of rac is consistent with earlier observations of the requirement of arf <dig> activation for rac ruffling, the synergy between arf <dig> and rac  <cit>  and the fact that activation of arf <dig> leads to activation of rac  <cit> . furthermore, the requirement that arf <dig> cycle between gdp-bound and gtp-bound forms to carry out its cellular functions is consistent with the known biology of arf proteins  <cit> .

intriguingly, two examples of proteins binding to arf6-gdp that subsequently lead to arf <dig> activation have been reported. tre <dig>  a protein involved in rac activity, binds specifically to the gdp-bound form of arf <dig>  which leads to increased activation of arf <dig>  <cit>  presumably by bringing arf <dig> in proximity to an arf <dig> gef. the second example is Î²-arrestin, a regulator of agonist-stimulated, Î²2-adrenergic receptor endocytosis, which binds to both arf6-gdp and arno, an arf <dig> gef, leading to activation of arf <dig>  <cit> . like Î²-arrestin, kalirin <dig> can make a complex with arf6-gdp and perhaps lead to the recruitment of efa <dig> or arno to promote arf <dig> activation. indeed, we have been able to capture arf6t27n and efa <dig> together bound to immobilized sr <dig>  suggesting that kalirin may provide a scaffold for sequential and coordinated activities.

our studies demonstrate that arf <dig> can regulate rac <dig> activity through interaction with kalirin. this novel signaling pathway may be involved in neurite outgrowth since each of these proteins are abundant in brain and have been implicated in this process. arf <dig> activity is required for rac1-mediated neurite outgrowth  <cit>  and the gef <dig> domains of kalirin and trio also induce neurite outgrowth through rhog activation  <cit> . exploring this functional relationship between arf <dig> and kalirin will give us more information about the mechanism for rho gef regulation and the crosstalk between these two small gtpases, arf <dig> and rac.

CONCLUSIONS
the gdp-bound form of arf <dig> can recruit spectrin repeat-containing rho gefs, such as kalirin, to membranes. the requirement that arf <dig> be able to cycle between gdp and gtp-bound forms for rac activation reveals how the arf <dig> gtp cycle may coordinate rac function.
