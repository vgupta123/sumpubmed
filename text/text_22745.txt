BACKGROUND
group iva cytosolic phospholipase a <dig>  releases arachidonic acid to initiate eicosanoid production  <cit> . eicosanoids are secreted and act locally through g-protein coupled receptors, which are expressed in a cell-type specific manner and initiate distinct signaling pathways to promote diverse biological responses . arachidonic acid is metabolized by 5-lipoxygenase  to leukotrienes, and by constitutive cyclooxygenase - <dig> and inducible cox- <dig> to prostaglandins and thromboxane  <cit> . leukotrienes are pro-inflammatory mediators produced by macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, basophils and eosinophils that regulate cell trafficking, cytokine production, vascular permeability and phagocyte function  <cit> . the cysteinyl leukotrienes including leukotriene c <dig>  leukotriene d <dig> and leukotriene e <dig> are bronchoconstrictors involved in asthma and allergic responses  <cit> . cpla2α and coxs are widely expressed reflecting the ability of most cells and tissues to produce prostanoids, which have diverse functions  <cit> . prostaglandins regulate normal physiological processes such as female reproduction, hemostasis, kidney function and the maintenance of the gastrointestinal tract  <cit> . although prostaglandins promote acute and chronic inflammation in response to tissue injury they also play a role in the resolution of inflammation and can be anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive . therefore cpla2α mediates the release of arachidonic acid for the production of numerous bioactive lipid mediators that have diverse effects  <cit> . this makes its role in regulating responses to infection difficult to predict and would be influenced by the specific tissue involved and nature of the microorganism.

eicosanoids are produced rapidly in response to engagement of pattern recognition receptors by microbial pathogens and modulate immune cell function by affecting phagocytosis, microbial killing, chemotaxis and the transcriptional program  <cit> . we have used resident tissue macrophages from the peritoneal cavity and the lung to study the mechanisms of cpla2α activation by the fungal pathogen candida albicans . resident tissue macrophages are sentinel cells that are first responders to microbial invasion for initiating host defense to infection  <cit> . in resident peritoneal macrophages, activation of cpla2α by c. albicans involves engagement of fungal cell wall polysaccharides β-glucan and mannans to c-type lectin receptors dectin- <dig> and dectin- <dig>  respectively  <cit> . these receptors act with myd88-dependent pathways to activate cpla2α, which involves calcium-induced translocation to membrane and phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinases. in peritoneal macrophages, c. albicans stimulates an autocrine loop involving cpla2α activation, production of prostaglandins and increases in camp that affects expression of genes involved in host defense and to dampen inflammation  <cit> . in contrast, alveolar macrophages exhibit distinct properties since c. albicans poorly stimulates cpla2α-mediated arachidonic acid release, however, priming with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor  enhances arachidonic acid release by increasing expression of dectin- <dig>  <cit> .

the lung has several mechanisms to clear environmental triggers that are continuously inhaled to prevent excess inflammation and tissue injury that may compromise gas exchange function  <cit> . candida is the predominant fungal genus in the oral cavity, and dispersal of microoganisms from this site to the lung is a mechanism for shaping the lung microbiome  <cit> . despite potential exposure from the oral cavity, levels of c. albicans in the healthy lung are low indicating mechanisms for efficient clearance to prevent colonization  <cit> . c. albicans is a commensal of mucosal surfaces that does not cause infection unless the immune system is compromised  <cit> . candida lung infection occurs in the critically ill, in patients with cancer and cystic fibrosis, during organ transplantation and in immune compromised individuals  <cit> . by comparing cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− mice, we found that cpla2α contributes to innate immune defenses in the lung for protection against c. albicans infection.

RESULTS
c. albicans infection causes greater weight loss in cpla2α−/− than cpla2α+/+ mice
the role of cpla2α in regulating host defense against c. albicans lung infection was investigated by comparing responses of cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− balb/c mice. the ld <dig> from intratracheal challenge with c. albicans in immune competent mice is approximately 108 cfu  <cit> . we first determined if concentrations below the ld <dig>  induced weight changes . there was significant weight loss from both cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− mice compared to saline controls 24 h after instillation of  <dig> candida that continued for 72 h . weight loss was significantly greater from cpla2α−/− than cpla2α+/+ mice at  <dig> and 72 h. challenging mice with 106c. albicans resulted in a small but significant weight loss in cpla2α+/+ mice at  <dig> and 24 h compared to saline controls followed by recovery of normal weight by 48–72 h . in cpla2α−/− mice challenged with 106c. albicans, weight loss continued from 24–72 h and was significantly greater than in cpla2α+/+ mice. cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/−mice were challenged with an intermediate amount of c. albicans  and survival and body weight monitored for 28 days. all cpla2α+/+ mice survived but 50 % of cpla2α−/− mice died by 72 h with no further mortality for 28 days . cpla2α−/− mice lost significantly more weight , which was greatest at day  <dig>  than cpla2α+/+ mice . the surviving cpla2α−/− mice and all cpla2α+/+ mice started gaining weight after day  <dig> that returned to normal by ~18 days. since the results suggest that cpla2α regulates early host defense to c. albicans lung infection, we focused on comparing early responses of cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− mice up to 72 h after c. albicans challenge.fig.  <dig> weight loss is greater in cpla2α−/− than cpla2α+/+ mice during c. albicans lung infection. body weight of cpla2α−/−  and cpla2α+/+  mice was monitored after intratracheal instillation of saline  or c. albicans  using an inoculum of   <dig> or   <dig> ca. body weight is expressed as the % of the weight determined just prior to instillation of c. albicans or saline . *p <  <dig>  compared to cpla2α+/+ with saline; #p <  <dig>  compared to cpla2α−/− with saline; **p <  <dig>  compared to cpla2α+/+ with ca. c survival of female cpla2α−/−  and cpla2α+/+  mice was monitored after intratracheal administration of  <dig> x 106 cfu c. albicans 



c. albicans is not cleared completely from the lungs of cpla2α−/− mice and disseminates to the kidney
the ability of cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− mice to clear c. albicans was compared by measuring fungal cfu in lung homogenates. it has previously been reported that immune competent mice are resistant to infection and rapidly eliminate c. albicans from the lung  <cit> . analysis of lungs 5 min after intratracheal challenge with 106c. albicans confirmed that greater than 90 % of the inoculum delivered to the lung was recovered in homogenates. by 6 h after instillation most  of the c. albicans was cleared from the lungs of cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− mice although significantly more remained in cpla2α−/− mice than cpla2α+/+ mice . cpla2α+/+ mice completely cleared c. albicans from the lung with no viable fungi recovered from 12–72 h after instillation, whereas a significant fungal burden persisted in cpla2α−/− mice during this time period. using a higher inoculum , a low level of c. albicans was recovered in lungs of cpla2α+/+ mice  at 72 h, and 30-fold higher levels in cpla2α−/− mice . we also determined if c. albicans breached the lung and disseminated to the kidney, which is the primary target organ in mice and humans in disseminated candidiasis  <cit> . c. albicans was recovered from the kidneys of cpla2α−/− mice challenged with 106 cfu at 12 h that further increased from 24–72 h . using an inoculum of 107 cfu, the kidneys of cpla2α−/− mice contained considerably more c. albicans than the relatively low level in mice challenged with 106 cfu. in contrast c. albicans was not detected in kidneys of cpla2α+/+ mice challenged with  <dig> or 107c. albicans . the results demonstrate a critical protective role for cpla2α in the early stages of candida clearance and dissemination in vivo. based on these results we investigated differences in the early host defense responses in cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α+/+ mice using the lower inoculum of 106c. albicans.fig.  <dig>

cpla2α−/− mice have higher numbers of neutrophils in balf and lung tissue than cpla2α+/+ mice during c. albicans infection
to evaluate the extent of inflammation in cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− mice, the recruitment of cells into balf was compared from 6–72 h after intratracheal instillation of 106c. albicans or saline . the number of total cells recovered in balf of untreated  and saline control mice was significantly higher  in cpla2α−/− than cpla2α+/+ mice that was due to higher numbers of alveolar macrophages . over 95 % of the cells in balf of cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− control mice were alveolar macrophages. the number of total cells in balf increased 6 h after c. albicans challenge to a slightly greater level in cpla2α−/− mice, then decreased by 12 h to similar levels in cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− mice . between  <dig> and 24 h after c. albicans instillation the number of total cells in cpla2α+/+ mice slightly declined but increased in cpla2α−/− mice due to greater neutrophil influx . the number of alveolar macrophages in balf increased at 6 h after c. albicans challenge to similar levels in cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− mice followed by a sharp decline in both strains at 12 h that remained low for 72 h . the decrease in the number of alveolar macrophages is reminiscent of the macrophage disappearance reaction observed in response to inflammation in the peritoneal cavity that is attributed to macrophage activation resulting in increased adherence or trafficking  <cit> . neutrophils significantly increased in balf from cpla2α−/− but not cpla2α+/+ mice 6 h after c. albicans instillation but then increased to similar levels in both strains at 12 h . neutrophil numbers in cpla2α+/+ mice peaked at 12 h but continued to increase in cpla2α−/− mice up to 24 h reaching levels  <dig> -fold higher than in cpla2α+/+ mice. neutrophil numbers in cpla2α−/− mice remained >2-fold higher than the levels in cpla2α+/+ mice up to 72 h after infection . it has been demonstrated that neutrophil influx into the lung during bacterial pneumonia contributes to alveolar barrier disruption promoting leakage of plasma protein into the alveolar space  <cit> . to determine if the increased neutrophil influx in c. albicans-infected cpla2α−/− mice was accompanied by an increase in protein leak into the lung, the amount of albumin in balf was determined by elisa . albumin levels increased at 12 h after c. albicans instillation to a similar extent in cpla2α−/− than cpla2α+/+ mice. albumin levels increased by 24 h and were  <dig> -fold higher in cpla2α−/− mice compared to cpla2α+/+ mice. the results indicate a greater compromise of alveolar barrier function in cpla2α−/− mice that correlated with a higher level of neutrophil influx in response to c. albicans infection.fig.  <dig> neutrophils and albumin are higher in balf of cpla2α−/− than cpla2α+/+ mice during c. albicans infection. the number of  total cells,  alveolar macrophages and  neutrophils were determined in balf  from cpla2α−/−  and cpla2α+/+  mice instilled with saline  or 106

cell influx into lung tissue of cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− mice 24 h after c. albicans infection was also evaluated by flow cytometry . c. albicans infection stimulated a significant increase in neutrophils  in lung tissue of both cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− mice but numbers were  <dig> -fold higher in cpla2α−/− mice . there were similar numbers of alveolar macrophages  in lungs of cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− mice, and numbers were not affected by c. albicans infection . this suggests that the higher number of alveolar macrophages in balf of uninfected cpla2α−/− mice  may be due to differences in adherence properties that influence their recovery by lavage. c. albicans infection stimulated an increase in tissue macrophages , which were significantly higher in cpla2α−/− compared to cpla2α+/+ mice . the tissue macrophage population, which includes both interstitial macrophages and monocytes, may increase due to recruitment of monocytes from the blood in response to c. albicans infection. cd11b+ dendritic cells  increased in response to c. albicans infection to a greater extent in cpla2α−/− compared to cpla2α+/+ mice . representative histograms of the flow cytometry analysis are shown in additional file  <dig>  histological examination of lung sections 24 h after c. albicans challenge showed little evidence of inflammation other than an occasional small patch of focal inflammation in cpla2α+/+ mice. the patches of inflammation were markedly larger and more extensive in cpla2α−/− than in cpla2α+/+ mice .fig.  <dig> effect of c. albicans infection on cell composition and histopathology of lung tissue from cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− mice. cpla2α−/−  and cpla2α+/+  mice were challenged with saline or 106 cfu c. albicans  for 24 h and then lavaged. lung tissue was processed for identification of  neutrophils,  alveolar macrophages ,  tissue macrophages  and  cd11b+ dendritic cells  by flow cytometry . *p <  <dig>  compared to cpla2α+/+ saline control; ϕ

cpla2α influences gene expression and cytokine production in lungs of c. albicans infected mice
we previously reported that activation of cpla2α in c. albicans-infected macrophages influences gene expression through an autocrine loop involving the production of prostaglandins and increases in camp  <cit> . we first screened differences in gene expression in total lung tissue of cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− mice at  <dig> and 24 h after instillation of c. albicans or saline by using a cytokine/chemokine pcr array . c. albicans infection stimulated an increase in expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines , and the immune mediators csf <dig> and ccl <dig>  in lungs of cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− mice. the level of these cytokines was significantly higher in cpla2α−/− compared to cpla2α+/+mice particularly 12 h after c. albicans challenge. the chemokines ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and cxcl <dig> were also expressed at higher levels in cpla2α−/− compared to cpla2α+/+mice 12 h after infection, but at 24 h they decreased to a greater extent in cpla2α−/− than cpla2α+/+mice. cxcl <dig> and ccl <dig> increased during c. albicans infection to the same extent in cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− mice at 12 h but were significantly lower in cpla2α−/− than cpla2α+/+mice at 24 h. the results evaluating gene expression in the total lung suggested that cpla2α activation suppresses the expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines but also influences the duration of gene expression particularly for certain chemokines .

since c. albicans first encounters cells lining the airways and in the alveoli, cytokines and chemokines were measured in balf from cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− mice collected 6–24 h after c. albicans infection . the pro-inflammatory cytokines il1α , il1β , tnfα  and il <dig>  were significantly higher in balf of cpla2α−/− compared to cpla2α+/+ mice at all time points but the time of peak production differed. il1α production was transient and peaked at 12 h in cpla2α−/− mice reaching levels that were 8-fold higher than in cpla2α+/+ mice . tnfα continued to increase in cpla2α−/− mice for 24 h . il <dig> was 10-fold higher in cpla2α−/− compared to cpla2α+/+ mice at  <dig> and 12 h after infection then decreased by 24 h . there was early production of il1β in cpla2α−/− mice that continued to increase up to 24 h after c. albicans infection . csf <dig>  and ccl <dig>  were significantly higher in cpla2α−/− than cpla2α+/+mice at  <dig> and 24 h after infection. the neutrophilic chemokine cxcl <dig> was higher in balf of cpla2α−/− than cpla2α+/+ mice particularly 24 h after c. albicans infection . although levels of csf <dig> mrna were similar in lungs of c. albicans infected cpla2α−/− and cpla2α+/+mice, analysis of balf showed that csf <dig> was higher in cpla2α−/− than cpla2α+/+ mice at 24 h . the results demonstrate that cpla2α−/− mice have higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines consistent with increased neutrophil recruitment.fig.  <dig> pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are higher in balf from cpla2α−/− than cpla2α+/+ mice during c. albicans infection. cpla2α−/−  and cpla2α+/+  mice were challenged with saline or 106

levels of eicosanoids in balf from cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− mice during c. albicans infection
cpla2α releases arachidonic acid for production of eicosanoids, which play diverse roles in regulating inflammation and innate immunity. eicosanoids were analyzed by mass spectrometry in balf collected 24 h after c. albicans infection from cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− mice . since cyclooxygenase metabolites and oxidation products can be generated during tissue processing from available free arachidonic acid, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin and antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene were added to the lavage solution before administration. by including d8-arachidonic acid in the lavage solution along with indomethacin, preliminary experiments showed that cyclooxygenase products were not generated during the lavage procedure since d <dig> metabolites were not found. in addition we found that it was necessary to include butylated hydroxytoluene during lavage to prevent the formation of isoprostanes. as shown in fig.  <dig>  c. albicans stimulated an increase in cysteinyl leukotriene production in cpla2α+/+ mice with the stable metabolite leukotriene e <dig> being the most abundant followed by leukotriene c <dig> and leukotriene d <dig> . cysteinyl leukotrienes were at very low or undetectable levels in saline controls and in balf from c. albicans infected cpla2α−/− mice indicating that cpla2α initiates their production. there was no significant production of leukotriene b <dig> in saline controls or in response to c. albicans infection in either cpla2α+/+ or cpla2α−/− mice. the cyclooxygenase metabolites thromboxane b <dig> , prostaglandin e <dig> and prostaglandin d <dig> were detected at the highest levels in balf of c. albicans infected cpla2α+/+ mice . thromboxane b <dig> and prostaglandin e <dig> were significantly lower in c. albicans-infected cpla2α−/− than cpla2α+/+ mice. although prostaglandin d <dig> levels were lower in c. albicans-infected cpla2α−/− mice than cpla2α+/+ mice this did not reach statistical significance. the stable metabolite of prostaglandin i <dig>  was detected in balf at relatively high endogenous levels but was not increased by c. albicans and not significantly different in cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− mice . therefore the higher levels of cysteinyl leukotrienes, thromboxane a <dig> or prostaglandin e <dig> in cpla2α+/+ than cpla2α−/− mice may be important for protecting the lung against c. albicans infection.fig.  <dig> eicosanoids are lower in balf from cpla2α−/− than cpla2α+/+ mice during c. albicans infection. levels of  cysteinyl leukotrienes, leukotriene c <dig> , leukotriene d <dig>  and leukotriene e <dig>  and  cyclooxygenase metabolites thromboxane b <dig> , prostaglandin e <dig> , prostaglandin d <dig>  and 6-keto prostaglandin f1α  were determined by mass spectrometry in balf from cpla2α−/−  and cpla2α+/+  mice instilled with saline or 106

neutrophils and alveolar macrophages play an important role in host defense against c. albicans, however, despite the increase in neutrophil influx in cpla2α−/− mice the fungus was not completely cleared from these mice. therefore the ability of these cells to recognize and kill c. albicans was determined. alveolar macrophages and neutrophils were isolated from uninfected cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− mice, and their ability to bind and internalize gfp-c. albicans  and to kill the fungus was examined in vitro. the binding/internalization of gfp-c. albicans  by cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− alveolar macrophages was similar but killing of gfp-c. albicans was ~25–30 % lower in cpla2α−/− macrophages . alveolar macrophages from cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− mice expressed similar levels of the lectin receptors dectin- <dig>  and dectin- <dig> . neutrophils from cpla2α−/− mice exhibited ~20–30 % less recognition and killing of gfp-c. albicans than cpla2α+/+ neutrophils . neutrophils from cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− mice expressed similar levels of dectin- <dig> but the levels of dectin- <dig>  were significantly higher in neutrophils from cpla2α−/− compared to cpla2α+/+mice, although dectin- <dig>  expression was 10-fold lower than dectin- <dig>  in neutrophils. we also evaluated the number of gfp-c. albicans that were engulfed by alveolar macrophages in vivo, which were isolated by lavage from cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− mice 6 h after challenge with gfp-c. albicans. alveolar macrophages from cpla2α−/− mice had significantly lower numbers of internalized gfp-c. albicans than macrophages from cpla2α+/+ mice . the results suggest that the higher levels of c. albicans in cpla2α−/− mice may in part be due to a reduced capacity of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils to kill c. albicans.fig.  <dig> recognition and killing of c. albicans by alveolar macrophages and neutrophils from cpla2α−/− and cpla2α+/+ mice. the ability of  alveolar macrophages and  neutrophils from untreated cpla2α+/+  and cpla2α−/−  mice to recognize and kill gfp-c. albicans in vitro was compared. levels of clec7a  and clec4n  expression were determined by real-time pcr.  alveolar macrophages were isolated by lavage from wt and ko mice 6 h after challenge with gfp-c. albicans and the % macrophages containing internalized gfp-c. albicans determined by microscopy. results are mean ± sem . *p <  <dig>  compared to cells from wt mice



discussion
cpla2α is a highly conserved enzyme that is widely expressed throughout all tissues in mice and humans, and is rapidly activated by diverse agonists through common signaling pathways  <cit> . it is the only mammalian pla <dig> that preferentially releases sn- <dig> arachidonic acid from phospholipids and its role in initiating the production of eicosanoids is well documented  <cit> . identification of humans with cpla2α deficiency has confirmed that it mediates eicosanoid production and functions in homeostatic processes important for human health . cpla2α has been implicated in regulating both normal physiological processes and disease pathogenesis in many organ systems from studies using cpla2α−/− mice, however, the specific mechanisms involved in many cases have not been elucidated  <cit> . in models of lung disease, cpla2α−/− mice are protected from pulmonary fibrosis, acute lung injury and allergic responses . since lung fibrosis and allergic lung responses are exacerbated in cox-1−/− and cox-2−/− mice but reduced in 5-lo−/− mice, the results suggest that in certain pro-inflammatory disease states cpla2α contributes to disease through a dominant role for pro-inflammatory leukotrienes . by comparing cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− mice in this study, we are probing the primary mechanism for eicosanoid production in vivo in response to exposure of the lung to the opportunistic pathogen c. albicans. this model reflects the collective influence of lipid mediators resulting from cpla2α activation in regulating innate immune responses. immune competent mice are resistant to infection from intratracheal instillation of c. albicans, which is rapidly cleared from the lungs with minimal health effects due to contributions from both alveolar macrophages and neutrophils in host defense  <cit> . our results suggest that cpla2α contributes to innate immune defense mechanisms in the lung to control c. albicans infection and dampen inflammation.

cpla2α−/− mice do not clear c. albicans from the lung as efficiently as cpla2α+/+ mice and exhibit greater signs of inflammation including excessive weight loss, increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased neutrophil recruitment to the lung. pro-inflammatory cytokines  are higher in cpla2α−/− than cpla2α+/+ mice 6–24 h after c. albicans infection. in mouse models of bacterial pneumonia these cytokines are produced by alveolar macrophages from initial interaction with pathogens and signal to epithelial cells and neutrophils to mount responses to infection . alveolar macrophages, isolated 6 h after intratracheal instillation, contain engulfed gfp-c. albicans indicating that the fungi reach the alveoli shortly after instillation. pro-inflammatory cytokines have been shown to induce the production of neutrophilic chemokines such cxcl <dig>  which is higher in cpla2α−/− mice and correlates with the elevated neutrophil influx  <cit> . c. albicans infection in cpla2α+/+ mice leads to a small but significant increase in production of tnfα, il1α and il1β, and induces neutrophil influx, although at lower levels than in cpla2α−/− mice. it is likely that these innate immune responses in cpla2α+/+ mice are important for host defense resulting in clearance of c. albicans from the lung. it has been shown that tnfα, il1α and il1β are important for host defense against invasive c. albicans infection in mice  <cit> . however, the exaggerated responses to c. albicans infection in cpla2α−/− mice point to an important role for cpla2α in regulating the balance of cytokines produced for effective microbial clearance without excess inflammation that may cause tissue injury and dissemination of c. albicans from the lung. this may in part be due to higher levels of pge <dig> in cpla2α+/+ mice since prostaglandins suppress the production of tnfα, il1α and il1β . pge <dig> is also important in maintaining endothelial barrier function, promoting wound healing and inhibiting neutrophil migration  <cit> . pgi <dig> also has anti-inflammatory properties  <cit> . our results show relatively high levels of endogenous pgi <dig> in balf suggesting constitutive production perhaps by vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells reflecting its important role in maintenance of the vasculature  <cit> . pgi <dig> levels were similar in balf from cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− mice, and not increased by c. albicans infection, suggesting another pla <dig> is involved in its production and that it is not involved in the phenotypic differences observed during c. albicans infection.

of the cytokines measured in balf, il <dig> showed the greatest increase in cpla2α−/− mice early after c. albicans instillation reaching levels 10-fold higher than in cpla2α+/+ mice. il <dig> is an indicator of disease severity, reflecting the more pronounced effect of c. albicans on the health of cpla2α−/− compared to cpla2α+/+ mice, which show only a small increase in il <dig> production  <cit> . il <dig> is considered a pleiotropic cytokine made by immune and stromal cells in response to diverse agonists that has a homeostatic function and regulates immunity  <cit> . il <dig> regulates the recruitment of leukocytes during infection and may contribute to the higher neutrophil influx in cpla2α−/− mice  <cit> . although il <dig> can be induced by prostaglandins, its higher level in cpla2α−/− mice suggests that it is directly made by cells in response to c. albicans perhaps through the early production of tnfα, il1α, and il1β  <cit> . in contrast to the results of this study, cpla2α−/− mice are protected during pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection that correlates with decreased il <dig> production  <cit> . therefore, cpla2α can exacerbate infection or have a protective role in the lung depending on the type of pathogen.

leukotrienes also regulate immunity in the lung during infection by promoting trafficking of neutrophils, t lymphocytes, dendritic cells and vascular permeability  <cit> . mice deficient in leukotriene production are more susceptible to bacterial  and fungal  lung infection showing impaired microbial clearance and survival . however there are differences in the responses of leukotriene-deficient mice to bacterial and fungal infection. following bacterial challenge, 5-lo−/− mice have reduced neutrophil influx in the lung  <cit> . however, histoplama capsulatum lung infection in 5-lo−/− mice results in increased neutrophil recruitment and greater production of pro-inflammatory cytokines than in wild type mice, as we observed in c. albicans-infected cpla2α−/− mice. leukotrienes regulate innate immune responses in part by enhancing alveolar macrophage phagocytosis and microbial killing  <cit> .

our results demonstrate that alveolar macrophages and neutrophils from uninfected cpla2α−/− mice have a reduced capacity to kill c. albicans than cells from cpla2α+/+ mice. we previously reported that c. albicans poorly activates cpla2α in alveolar macrophages from cpla2α+/+ mice and induces very little eicosanoid production, although it is enhanced by priming with gm-csf due to increased expression of dectin- <dig>  <cit> . therefore it is not likely that this inherent difference in the killing capacity of alveolar macrophages from uninfected cpla2α+/+ and cpla2α−/− mice is due to production of endogenous eicosanoids during the killing assay in vitro. the basis for this inherent difference in c. albicans killing is not known but the lack of eicosanoids during development of cpla2α−/− mice may affect gene expression that influences killing of c. albicans. the results also showed that alveolar macrophages isolated from cpla2α−/− mice 6 h after instillation of gfp-c. albicans have fewer engulfed gfp-c. albicans than macrophages from cpla2α+/+ mice. it is likely that cells are primed by cytokines in vivo to enhance production of eicosanoids and regulate killing of c. albicans.

a role for the epithelium during c. albicans lung infection is suggested by results showing that cpla2α−/− mice have higher levels of ccl <dig> and csf <dig> than cpla2α+/+ mice. during lung infection ccl <dig> and csf <dig>  are derived from lung epithelium and contribute to recruitment of dendritic cells and neutrophils  <cit> . the lung epithelium may also contribute to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines since c. albicans stimulates oral and vaginal epithelial cells to produce chemokines and cytokines including il1α, il1β and tnfα  <cit> . although this has not been investigated in lung epithelial cells, there may be a local immune response at the lung mucosa for combating c. albicans in cpla2α+/+ mice. it is interesting that c. albicans disseminates to the kidney in cpla2α−/− mice suggesting there is damage to the epithelial/endothelial barrier possibly due to the increased inflammation. since alveolar epithelium damage can be sensed by alveolar macrophages this may lead to heightened pro-inflammatory responses as we observed in cpla2α−/− mice  <cit> . the results suggest that cpla2α activation is an important mechanism for regulating the function of immune and stromal cells in the lung to protect from c. albicans infection.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that cpla2α plays a role in protecting the lung from c. albicans infection. since production of lipid mediators occurs rapidly in response microbial infection we focused on how this pathway regulates the early innate immune responses to c. albicans in the lung in an attempt to assess the more immediate effects of this pathway. the results suggest that cpla2α contributes to lung homeostasis and the immunosuppressive environment in the lung. there may be tonic pattern receptor signaling resulting in cpla2α activation and lipid mediator production in the lung by low-level colonization or exposure to commensal organisms such as c. albicans from the oral cavity. this promotes clearance of the relatively avirulent commensal fungus that limits infection and inflammation preventing more pathogenic effects. it is likely that the balance of products from both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways is important in immune surveillance in the lung contributing to mucosal integrity and the function of phagocytes for efficient clearance of infectious agents and regulating the extent of inflammation.
