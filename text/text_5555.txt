BACKGROUND
macrophages are highly plastic cells that respond to diverse environments by altering their phenotype and physiology  <cit>  and play important roles in both innate and adaptive immunity. currently, macrophages are classified under two phenotypes, classically activated macrophages  and alternatively activated macrophages . camΦ are induced by interferon-gamma  and lipopolysaccharide , whereas induction of the aamΦ phenotype is associated with various stimuli, such as il-4/il- <dig>  il- <dig>  immunocomplexes, and glucocorticoids  <cit> . the most widely studied stimuli for generating aamΦ is treatment with il-4/il- <dig>  <cit> . although il-4/il- <dig> signaling are essential to the presence of aamΦ and both cytokines have many overlapping activities on macrophages, they exhibit distinct functions because of their specific receptor subunits aside from their shared common alpha chain  <cit> . however, this does not alter the fact that a th2-dominated environment is critical for aamΦ induction  <cit> . all helminths have been demonstrated to induce profound th <dig> responses, which are characterized by the production of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> by cd4+ t cells  <cit> , and this th2-dominated cytokine profile is associated with the presence of the aamΦ phenotype . aamΦ are increasingly recognized as a key effector arm of the th <dig> immunity, but their real function in various helminth infections has not been illustrated and is likely to be diverse. however, discovery of molecular markers of aamΦ, such as mannose receptor , il- <dig>  arginase - <dig> , resistin-like molecule , and ym <dig>  <cit> , made the identification of aamΦ possible. among them, three most abundant il-4/il- <dig> dependent genes: ym <dig>  a member of the family  <dig> chitinases family but with no chitinolytic activity  <cit> , relmα, was described as fizz <dig>  <cit> , and is identified as a cysteine-rich molecule associated with resistin that is involved in glucose metabolism  <cit> . arginase  <dig> plays a role in the regulation of nitric oxide  production by competing with inos for substrate l-arginine  <cit> , suppression of t cell responses via l-arginine depletion  <cit>  and has been currently accepted as a molecular signature for aamΦ. however, the functions of aamΦ in helminth infections have not been fully illustrated. questions such as whether aamΦ promotes helminth killing or expulsion, whether alternative activation requires anti-worm effector function, or whether signaling tlrs play a role in aamΦ induction, have not been fully answered.

in the current study, the role of tlrs in aamΦ induction during f. hepatica infection, which has been observed to produce th2-dominated responses in both mice and the natural ruminant hosts  <cit>  is investigated using myd88-deficient mice.

tlrs are pattern recognition receptors  that recognize different pathogen-associated molecular patterns   <cit> . tlr signaling is mostly myd88-dependent  <cit>  except for tlr <dig> signaling, which requires a trif adaptor  <cit> . mice lacking myd <dig> cannot respond to lps  <cit> . the absence of myd <dig> has been demonstrated to have no effect on the augmentation of th <dig> responses  <cit> , which indicates that th <dig> responses are elicited in a myd88-independent manner. however, contrary results have also demonstrated that tlr signaling plays a role in th <dig> responses  <cit> . aside from the required th <dig> environment, especially with il-4/il- <dig>  the determinants of the aamΦ phenotype remain unclear. for f. hepatica infection, whether tlr signaling is required for aamΦ induction is unknown. therefore, whether aamΦ could be induced without myd <dig> and whether tlr signals affect aamϕ activation were investigated.

RESULTS
lacking of myd <dig> has no impact on the presence of aamΦ derived from bone marrow
to determine whether myd <dig> signaling is required for aamΦ induction, investigations were made to determine whether bmmϕ, cultured from both wt and myd <dig> knockout mice, could be activated through this approach. this is based on the fact that arginase- <dig> upregulation, which is generally associated with th <dig> cytokines, such as il- <dig>  <cit> , is a feature of aamΦs. as a control, inos, the enzyme associated with camΦs, was also detected  <cit> . bmmϕs were treated with lps and ifn-γ, either together or separately, or with media alone for 20- <dig> h after overnight treatment with or without il- <dig>  subsequently, arginase- <dig> and inos enzyme activity were measured . the results show both wt and myd88-/- bmmϕ cells displayed arginase activity in response to il- <dig> compared with the cells without il- <dig> stimulation even though no statistically significant differences were found between groups . wt bmmϕs treated with lps also exhibited arginase activity and were absent in myd88-/- mice. inos activity was monitored by measuring nitrite concentrations in the bmmϕ supernatant fluids using the greiss reagent. the results show that wt bmmϕs  produced nitrite when stimulated with lps alone and with ifn-γ. a synergistic effect was observed on the inos activity with further upregulation when treated with both lps and ifn-γ compared with lps or ifn-γ treatment alone . myd88-/- bmmϕ showed similar trend with wt bmmϕ on no production. however, almost no no was detected upon stimulation with lps alone compared with wt bmmϕs. moreover, no could be produced via pretreatment with il- <dig> followed by stimulation with lps alone. treatment with ifn-γ alone had no effect on no production  even with il- <dig> treatment .

myd88-deficiency of has no effect on arginase- <dig>  relmα, and ym <dig> expression in bmmϕs
to ascertain further the phenotype of the aamϕs elicited by the f. hepatica infection, the gene expression of aamϕ markers arginase- <dig>  relmα, and ym <dig> in bmmϕ were measured via real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction . the results show no deficiency in aamϕgeneration in the myd88-/- animals. figure  <dig> shows that arginase- <dig> expression in myd88-/- bmmϕ treated with il- <dig> was lower than that of wt bmmϕ, and no expression on both untreated wt and myd88-/- bmmϕ. the expression profiles of both relmα and ym <dig> in the bmmϕs show similar trends with higher levels on the myd88-/- bmmϕ treated with il-4; however, no statistically significant differences were found .

the th <dig> cytokine bias is not significantly altered in f. hepatica-infected mice in the absence of myd <dig> in vitro and in vivo
ascertaining any effects on the overall th <dig> response in f. hepatica-infected mice is essential before determining the effect of myd <dig> knockdown on macrophage activation in vivo. consequently, the th <dig> cytokines il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  together with ifn-γ, a marker of th <dig> response, were monitored in the supernatant fluids of cultured splenocytes treated with media, anti-cd <dig>  or fhag . the results showed that all th <dig> cytokines were elevated on fhag stimulation in the infected wt mice and were further increased in the myd88-/- infected mice, although no statistically significant difference was found between the wt and myd88-/- infected mice. in contrast, the th <dig> response, as measured with ifn-γ decreased significantly upon stimulation with fhag or anti-cd <dig> but not media in the infected myd88-/- mice compared with the wt infected mice . meanwhile, the thioglycolate-injected wt and myd88-/- mice exhibited low levels of both th <dig> and th <dig> compared with their infected counterparts. the local cytokine production in the pec supernatant fluid  was also measured. significantly higher il- <dig> levels were observed in the myd88-/- infected mice compared with both the wt and the wt-infected mice . similar trends were seen in cytokine il- <dig> and il- <dig> . however, no statistically significant difference in il- <dig> production was found between the wt and myd88-/- mice in both the thio and infection treatments. in contrast, the ifn-γ in the both myd88-/- thio and the myd88-/- infected mice significantly decreased compared with that in the f. hepatica-infected wt mice. overall, these results show that the th <dig> response is not impaired in f. hepatica-infected myd88-/- mice both in vitro and vivo.

myd88-deficiency did not affect the arginase production of the f. hepatica-elicited macrophages in pecs
to determine whether myd88-deficiency affects production in macrophages recruited in pec, the arginase activity levels were measured using the purified macrophages from the pec . as shown, macrophages from f. hepatica-infected mice produced more arginase than macrophages from the mice treated with thioglycolate, and the myd88-/- and wt infected mice produced significantly higher arginase than the myd88-/- thio mice, although no difference was seen between the wt thio and the wt infected mice. in addition, no significant difference in arginase levels was observed between the wt and myd88-/- infected mice.

the absence of myd <dig> had no effect on relmα and ym <dig> production by cells in the peritoneal cavity after f. hepatica infection
we investigated whether the absence of myd <dig> impairs relmα and ym <dig> expression in peritoneal lavage fluid using western blot analysis  and real-time rt-pcr . as shown in the figure, although both the relmα and ym <dig> protein signals were detected in the wt and the myd88-/- infected mice, no significant difference was found between these two groups. to determine whether the mrna expression levels correlates with protein production, total rna was extracted from purified macrophages in the peritoneal cavity and real-time rt-pcr was performed to detect relmα, ym <dig>  and arginase <dig> mrna expression . although wt and myd88-/- infected mice produced detectable relmα and ym <dig>  they could not be detected in the wt and myd88-/- thio mice. no statistically significant difference in relmα and ym <dig> mrna expression was observed between the wt and the myd88-/- infected mice, which is consistent with the protein profiles of relmα and ym <dig> above.

discussion
the data demonstrates that macrophages from a chronic infection, which consequently produce th <dig> type cytokines at the stage wherein young f. hepatica penetrates the liver capsule and migrates through the liver tissue, do not require tlr signaling for aamΦ induction.

like many other helminths, to establish successful chronic infections, f. hepatica induces th <dig> responses characterized by increased il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  activation and expansion of eosinophils, cd4+cells, basophils, and mast cells  <cit> . simultaneously, helminths release excretory-secretory proteins  to prevent dendritic cells and macrophages from acting on tlr <dig> th1-stimulating ligands such as lps and cpg during infections  <cit> . for example, cathepsin l <dig> cysteine protease released by f. hepatica suppresses the macrophage tlr recognition of lps  <cit> . however, different infective stages may develop diverse immune responses. for instance, cytotoxic natural killer  cells dominate in the peritoneal fluid of f. hepatica-infected rats as early as  <dig> days post infection . however, the cells decreased  <dig> days p.i.  <cit> . therefore, the experimental set-up depends on the response outcomes needed. according to the life cycle of f. hepatica, the juvenile flukes penetrate the liver capsule and migrate through the liver tissue at  <dig> to  <dig> weeks before entering the bile ducts. this stage is rigorous for the host because of the violent penetration and migration of flukes. in addition, most activity detections of macrophages focus on the early stage of f. hepatica infection  <cit> ; thus, little is known about the aamΦ at  <dig> weeks post f. hepatica infection, which is the reason why the aamΦ phenotype in myd <dig> deficient mice at this stage needs to be addressed.

the data demonstrates that the absence of myd <dig> does not impair the th <dig> response in f. hepatica-infected mice compared with the infected wt mice when the splenocytes in vitro were stimulated with fhag. furthermore, a non-statistically significant increase toward the th <dig> response was also found in between. moreover, the in vivo experiments also show that il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> on myd88-/- infected mice were significantly higher compared with the wt and wt-infected mice. in contrast, the ifn-γ in both the myd88-/- thio and the myd88-/- infected mice were significantly decreased compared with that in f. hepatica-infected wt mice, which indicates that a th2- dominant response was induced in vivo. this is consistent with the previous studies that provide evidence of elevated th <dig> responses when myd88-deficient mice were infected with leishmania major  <cit> , chlamydia muridarum  <cit> , or schistosoma mansoni  <cit> . similarly, myd <dig> -/- mice infected with the gastrointestinal nematode trichuris muris exhibited high resistance to infection and displayed an increase in il- <dig> and il- <dig> in cultured mesenteric lymph node cells with stimulation of t. muris specific antigen in vitro  <cit>  compared with their wt counterparts. however, this was argued to be associated with powerful th <dig> stimuli via a myd88-dependent pathway because of the presence of commensal bacteria, which indicates the th <dig> response to nematodes might be impaired because of increased th <dig> response  <cit> . this is supported by experiments on s. mansoni showing that the absence of myd <dig> supports th <dig> responses  <cit> . however, in the present study, f. hepatica infection was not yet reported to carry any bacteria, which may mount a th <dig> response. therefore, no significant augmentation was seen in the myd <dig> deficient mice. however, the th <dig> response was clearly induced in the wt mice and mice lacking myd <dig> with f. hepatica infection. as demonstrated by previous studies, th <dig> response induced by helminth infections contribute to aamΦ production , f. hepatica infection may promote aamΦ. this is supported by the fact that aamΦ could be produced by fhag combined with il- <dig> and stimulation with fhag together with lps  or purified protein derivative from mycobacterium bovis  in wt mice resulted in reduced no or ifn-γ production, respectively  <cit> . also, the thioredoxin peroxidase  secreted by f. hepatica induced the aamΦ on cell lines in vitro  <cit> . along with the present study, an implication that myd <dig> deficiency is dispensable to the aamϕ may be reached.

the present study implies that myd <dig> is not required for th <dig> response and aamϕ activation. in wt bmmϕ, arginase production increased on treatment with lps, which signals through the tlr <dig> pathway, which is consistent with the reports that lps helps induce the production of both arginase isoforms   <cit> . further, the arginase activity in myd88-/- bmmϕ, treated with the media, lps, ifn-γ, or both was almost absent, indicating that this activity is myd88-independent. in both the wt and myd88-/- bmmϕ, arginase mrna increased upon treatment with il- <dig>  which is in agreement with the reports that arginase could be induced when stimulated with il- <dig>  <cit>  similar trends were seen in the production of relmα and ym <dig> mrna in wt and myd88-/- bmmϕ in response to il- <dig>  these findings offering further evidence that aamϕ is induced in myd <dig> deficient mice. on the other hand, no was produced synergistically by myd88-/- bmmϕ when stimulated with both lps and ifn-γ together, whereas it was produced by wt bmmϕ when treated with lps alone. the no produced by macrophages is essential to the suppression of host cytotoxicity and its production may be myd88-dependent or -independent. in the present study, lps signals through the tlr <dig> via the irf- <dig> pathway during myd88-deficiency, resulting in an increase in ifnβ instead of inos. ifnβ then induces irf- <dig> production, which leads to the production of no with the help of ifn-γ. this was supported by koide et al.  <cit> , who showed that the lps-dependent increase in inos mrna expression induced by ifn-γ is attributed to the irf- <dig> upregulation induced by lps. moreover, inos cannot be induced by ifn-γ alone because of the lack of irf- <dig> in the absence of myd <dig>  however, this speculation was not yet investigated.

considering no significant difference was found in the th <dig> cytokine profiles between the wt and myd88-deficient mice, the lack of myd <dig> may have affected the production of macrophages. however, the arginase activity in the macrophages from the pec were at approximately the same level in the wt and myd88-/- aamϕs  despite both being significantly higher than those in myd <dig> -/- thio aamϕs. relmα and ym <dig> protein expression in the peritoneal cavity were not impaired with the myd88-deficiency  and the mrna expression of both genes  retained the same profiles as the protein expression, respectively. however, some effects on the response to thioglycolate treatment of the myd88-deficient mice were observed, which indicates the partial role of tlr stimulus in thioglycolate-induced macrophage phenotype. these findings may be related to the mixture of tlr ligands in thioglycolate, which might have been ignored when the actual function of thioglycolate in macrophage activation was analyzed. all of these findings support that myd <dig> is not required for macrophage activation during f. hepatica infection.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, myd <dig> is not required for aamϕ induction in vitro and in vivo. in addition, the th <dig> cytokine profile remained intact in the myd88-deficient mice infected with the f. hepatica  <dig> weeks post infection.
