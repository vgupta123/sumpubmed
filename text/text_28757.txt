BACKGROUND
peripheral blood monocytes  originate from hematopoietic progenitor cells in bone marrow and play important roles in innate and adaptive immunity due to their ability to differentiate into macrophages  and dendritic cells   <cit> . the heterogeneity and plasticity of mΦ and dc result from their differentiation in specific tissue microenvironments  <cit> . the expression of cd <dig>  distinguishes two mo subsets in peripheral blood of healthy individuals: a major cd16- subset  and a minor cd16+ subset   <cit> . compared to classical cd16- mo, cd16+ mo exhibit a more mΦ-like morphology, produce higher levels of tnf and il- <dig>  <cit> , have higher antigen presenting potential  <cit> , and differentiate into dc upon transendothelial migration in vitro  <cit> . cd16+ mo express cx3cr <dig> and migrate in response to cx3cl <dig>  <cit> , a membrane-bound chemokine expressed on inflamed endothelial cells, while cd16- mo express cd62l and ccr <dig> and migrate in response to ccl <dig>  <cit> , which mediates mo migration from bone marrow and recruitment to inflammatory sites  <cit> . cd16+ mo produce il- <dig>  ccl <dig>  and matrix metalloproteinase- <dig> upon interaction with cx3cl1-expressing endothelial cells  <cit>  and activate resting t-cells for hiv infection by producing ccr <dig> and ccr <dig> ligands  <cit> . together, these findings suggest that cd16+ and cd16- mo are recruited into different anatomic sites under constitutive or inflammatory conditions, and play distinct functional roles in immunity and disease pathogenesis.

a dramatic increase in circulating cd16- mo has been reported in inflammatory pathologies such as sepsis, hiv infection, tuberculosis, and asthma  <cit> . studies of patients infected with mycobacterium leprae demonstrated that cd16+ and cd16- mo differentiate into dc-sign+ mΦ and cd1b+dc-sign- dc, respectively, and the presence of cd1b+dc-sign- dc in m. leprae lesions was associated with healing  <cit> . an increased frequency of cd16+ mo was associated with non-healing leishmania chagasi lesions  <cit> . thus, cd16+ and cd16- mo differentiation into mΦ or dc subpopulations with distinct phenotypes influences host defenses in infectious disease. consequently, there is interest in developing therapeutic strategies that target specific mo subpopulations  <cit> .

mo heterogeneity is conserved across mammalian species  <cit> . in mice, gr1+cx3cr1low mo  are recruited into the peritoneal cavity or draining lymph nodes under inflammatory conditions by mechanisms dependent on ccr <dig> and cd62l, and subsequently differentiate into dc  <cit> . in contrast, gr1-cx3cr1high  are constitutively recruited into peripheral tissues including spleen, gut, lungs, and brain  <cit> . gr1-cx3cr1high patrol vascular endothelium by mechanisms involving lfa- <dig> and cx3cr <dig>  and are rapidly recruited into inflamed tissues where they differentiate into mΦ expressing the transcription factors cmaf and mafb and transiently producing tnf-α  <cit> . studies in cx3cr1/apoe double knockout mice suggest that cx3cr1high mo play a critical role in development of atherosclerotic lesions  <cit> . cx3cr1+ mo may be precursors for lamina propria dc, which depend on cx3cr <dig> to form transepithelial dendrites, enabling direct sampling of luminal antigens  <cit> . furthermore, adoptive transfer studies in rats demonstrated that ccr2lowcx3cr1high mo are constitutively recruited into the gut where they give rise to intestinal lymph dc  <cit> . studies on the origin of myeloid pulmonary dc demonstrated that ly-6chighccr2highcx3cr1low mo differentiate into cd103+ dc  <cit> ), whereas ly-6clowccr2lowcx3cr1high mo give rise to cd11bhigh dc  <cit> . thus, cx3cr1high and cx3cr1low mo subsets play distinct functional roles under constitutive and inflammatory conditions.

the developmental relationship between mo subsets is poorly understood. in mice, mo recently emigrating from bone marrow exhibit a ly-6chigh phenotype and gradually downregulate ly-6c  <cit> . mo acquire cd <dig> expression upon exposure to m-csf  <cit> , tgf-β  <cit> , or il- <dig>  <cit> , and upregulate cx3cr <dig> expression upon ccl <dig> stimulation via ccr <dig>  <cit> . mo differentiation is associated with decreased ccr <dig> expression and increased ccl <dig> production  <cit> . engrafted gr1highcx3cr1low mo in peripheral blood traffic to the bone marrow, differentiate into gr1lowcx3cr1high mo, and contribute to mucosal, but not splenic, generation of dc  <cit> . these findings suggest that human cd16+ mo and mouse ly-6clowccr2lowcx3cr1high mo differentiate from cd16- mo and gr1-ly-6chighccr2highcx3cr1low mo, respectively.

here, we investigate the developmental and functional relationship between cd16+ and cd16- mo subsets. whole genome transcriptome analysis suggests that these mo subsets originate from a common myeloid precursor, with cd16+ mo being at a more advanced stage of differentiation and having a more mΦ – and dc-like transcription program. upregulation of the transcription factors rara and klf <dig> in cd16+ mo coincided with the absence of cutaneous lymphocyte associated antigen  expression, indicating potential imprinting for non-skin homing in cd16+ mo. these results define distinct transcriptional profiles of cd16- and cd16+ mo subsets suggesting different stages of myeloid differentiation, new markers to distinguish these mo subpopulations, and unique roles in immune responses and inflammatory diseases.

flow cytometry analysis
blood from healthy individuals was collected with informed consent and irb approval from dana-farber cancer institute. pbmc isolated from peripheral blood by ficoll-paque gradient density centrifugation were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated abs and analyzed by multi-color flow cytometry .

monocyte sorting
monocytes  were isolated by negative selection using magnetic immunobeads  as described  <cit> . the purity of sorted mo was >98%, as determined by facs analysis indicating the expression of cd <dig> and hla-dr  and absence of cd1c , cd <dig> , cd <dig> , cd <dig> , and cd16b and cd66b  expression. cd16+ and cd16- mo fractions were further isolated using cd <dig> magnetic immunobeads  with >85% and >95% purity for cd16+ and cd16- mo fractions, respectively, as determined by facs analysis after staining with cd <dig> abs  <cit> . mo fractions isolated under rnase free conditions were stored in trizol at -80°c for subsequent rna extraction.

rna isolation and microarray analysis
total rna from mo pellets was isolated by trizol extraction and purified using rneasy columns . the quality of rna was assessed by visualization of intact bands corresponding to 18s and 28s rrna on formaldehyde agarose gels. total rna  from matched cd16+ and cd16- mo samples isolated from  <dig> different healthy donors was quality tested using an agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer chip, reverse transcribed, and hybridized on the genechip® human genome u <dig> plus  <dig>  array , which includes  <dig>  probe sets on a single array . primary data analysis performed using genespring software  generated excel spreadsheets with relative gene expression values for the  <dig> matched cd16+ and cd16- mo subsets.

microarray data analysis
a total of  <dig>  probe sets were detected in these  <dig> samples . normalization was performed as described  <cit>  to account for variation between microarrays. missing value estimation was performed using a modified knn algorithm  <cit> . t-test was used to identify probe sets differentially expressed in cd16+ and cd16- mo . these genes were sorted according to their t-statistics and fold change ratios, which were calculated by computing the mean expression in cd16+ and cd16- mo. clustering analysis using fuzzy-c-means  <cit>  was performed based on the genes selected by f-test . false discovery rates   <cit>  were estimated using dchip software   <cit>  by performing  <dig> random permutations using all  <dig> samples with p-values <  <dig> , expression ratio cut-off =  <dig> -fold, and present call cut-off of 20%, yielding a median fdr of  <dig> . expression ratios for differentially expressed probe sets were calculated in cd16+ versus cd16- mo . heat maps for biological function categories were generated by dchip software using signal values from each of the  <dig> samples for genes that were > 2-fold upregulated or downregulated in cd16+ mo compared to cd16- mo. the entire microarray dataset and technical information requested by minimum information about a microarray experiment  are available at the gene expression omnibus  database under accession number gse <dig>  .

gene set enrichment analysis 
gene set enrichment analysis  and molecular signature database   were used to identify differentially expressed gene sets  <cit> . gsea is a computational method that determines whether an a priori defined set of genes shows statistically significant concordant differences between two biological states . msigdb contains more than  <dig> gene sets for use with gsea. an enrichment score  that represents the difference between the observed and expected rankings from phenotype correlation was calculated for every gene set. a nominal p-value for the specific es was then estimated from an empirical permutation-based null distribution that preserves the complex correlation structure of the gene expression data. multiple testing was corrected via the fdr, with fdr less than 10% considered statistically significant.

one step sybr green real time rt-pcr  was carried out in an icycler biorad en <dig> pcr machine according to manufacturer's recommendations. absolute quantification of target gene expression was performed using a 10-fold serial dilution of purified pcr products as described  <cit> . briefly, 25– <dig> ng total rna was reverse transcribed in  <dig> μl 1× sybr green mix  containing  <dig>  μm primers, and  <dig> nm fluorescein calibration dye . agarose gel electrophoresis was used to determine the size of amplification products  and allowed cdna purification  for standard curve preparation . primers spanning one or multiple exons were purchased from qiagen . samples without template and reverse transcriptase were used as negative controls. the concentration of each gene was normalized to the 28s ribosomal rna  internal control  <cit> . each rt-pcr reaction was performed in triplicate.

RESULTS
distinct gene expression profiles in cd16+ and cd16- monocytes
to define transcriptional profiles of monocyte subsets in vivo, we performed genome wide transcriptome analysis of matched cd16+ and cd16- mo subsets in peripheral blood of four healthy individuals. we identified  <dig>  probe sets that were differentially expressed and  <dig>  genes that were similarly expressed in these mo subsets  . clustering analysis separated the  <dig> samples into  <dig> groups that perfectly matched cd16+ and cd16- mo, with  <dig>  genes downregulated and  <dig>  genes upregulated in cd16+ compared to cd16- mo . calculation of expression ratios for  <dig>  differentially expressed probe sets showed that  <dig> probe sets were downregulated  and  <dig> probe sets were upregulated  in cd16+ compared to cd16- mo  . these 2-fold lists of differentially expressed genes included known markers for cd16+  and cd16- mo   <cit>  , providing initial validation of microarray results. signature transcripts for other blood cell lineages were absent in both cd16+ and cd16- mo , consistent with results obtained by flow cytometry demonstrating the purity of sorted mo  and absence of dc , nk cell , b cell , t cell , neutrophil  markers on cd16+ and cd16- mo. the difference in relative expression of some probe sets for donor # <dig> probably reflects normal donor-to-donor variability, since post-sort cell viability, rna quality, and microarray quality controls were similar for the four donors. a more stringent analysis was performed where in addition to a cut-off >2-fold and p-value <  <dig> , probe sets with expression levels >3-fold higher than background were selected; by this approach, we identified  <dig> downregulated and  <dig> upregulated probe sets in cd16+ compared to cd16- mo . these genes were further selected for those with the highest levels of expression , cut-off >2-fold; p-value <  <dig> ) and two lists of top genes were generated, with  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts upregulated in cd16+ and cd16- mo, respectively . other genes were differentially expressed with a difference <2-fold. in cd16+ compared to cd16- mo, downregulated markers included the early myeloid markers cd <dig>  and cd <dig> . thus, despite a high level of transcriptional similarity , a subset of probe sets were significantly downregulated  or upregulated  in cd16+ compared to cd16- mo, suggesting that these mo subsets represent different stages of myeloid differentiation and have distinct biological functions in vivo.

validation of microarray results and identification of new surface markers that distinguish cd16+ and cd16- monocytes
real time rt-pcr was used to quantify expression of nine differentially expressed genes identified by microarray analysis. results in figure  <dig> indicate increased mrna expression for cd <dig>  c3ar <dig>  icam- <dig>  csf1r, cdkn1c, tnfrsf <dig>  and ltb, and decreased mrna expression for c1qr <dig> and csf3r in cd16+ compared to cd16- mo . microarray results were also validated at the protein level by flow cytometry analysis. consistent with the microarray and real time rt-pcr results , facs analysis demonstrated that cd14lowcd16+  compared to classical cd14highcd16- mo  expressed higher levels of cd115/csfr <dig>  and c3ar <dig>  and lower levels of cd114/csf3r  and cd93/c1qr <dig> on the cell surface . a third mo subset with an intermediate phenotype, cd14highcd16+ mo, exhibited intermediate expression levels of cd <dig> and cd <dig> and similar levels of cd <dig> and c3ar <dig> compared to cd14lowcd16+ mo and cd14highcd16- mo, respectively . in addition, cd16+ compared to cd16- mo expressed higher levels of cxcl <dig> and cd <dig> and lower levels of cd1d . as expected, cx3cr <dig> was also expressed at higher levels . thus, we identified new surface markers that distinguish cd16- mo  and cd16+ mo .

biological functions of differentially expressed genes
differentially expressed genes, corresponding to  <dig> downregulated and  <dig> upregulated probe sets in cd16+ compared to cd16- mo, were classified into eight functional categories using gene ontology. heat maps for biological function categories  showed clear distinctions in patterns of gene expression between the mo subpopulations for these categories.

adhesion molecules, chemokines, and chemokine receptors
genes upregulated in cd16+ compared to cd16- mo included those coding for the tetraspanins ms4a4a and ms4a <dig>  adhesion molecules siglec <dig>  icam- <dig>  spn/cd <dig>  itgal/lfa-1/cd11a, cd <dig>  and pcam1/cd <dig>  chemokine receptor cx3cr <dig>  and chemokine cxcl <dig>  <cit> . genes downregulated in cd16+ compared to cd16- mo included those coding for the tetraspanin ms4a6a, adhesion molecules itgam/cd11b, sell/l-selectin/cd62l, cd <dig>  and junctional adhesion molecule like   <cit> , and chemokine receptors ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  and formyl peptide receptor  <dig>  . these results identify siglec <dig>  icam- <dig>  spn/cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and cxcl <dig> as new markers upregulated on cd16+ mo that are relevant for t cell activation, and fpr <dig> as a chemokine receptor preferentially expressed on cd16- mo. in addition, these results indicate the distinct trafficking potential of cd16+ and cd16- mo , consistent with previous studies  <cit> .

cytokines and cytokine receptors
cd16+ mo expressed significantly higher levels of mrna for the cytokines lymphotoxin beta  and leukocyte specific transcript  <dig>  and the cytokine receptors tnf receptor superfamily  <dig> , prostaglandin e receptor  <dig> , colony stimulating factor  <dig> receptor , and il-12rb <dig>  genes downregulated in cd16+ mo included those coding for the cytokine il-1ra, platelet-activating factor receptor , and il1b and cytokine receptors il13ra <dig>  il27ra , colony stimulating factor  <dig> receptor , il6r, and il6st/gp <dig>  . these results provide further evidence for pro-inflammatory genes upregulated in cd16+ mo   <cit>  and suggest the ability of cd16+ and cd16- mo to respond to distinct cytokines including il- <dig>  <cit>  and il- <dig>  <cit>  and il- <dig> and il- <dig>  <cit> , respectively, which has potential implications for th <dig> and th <dig> polarization of immune responses. in addition, these results identify csf1r and csf3r as new markers for cd16+ and cd16- mo, respectively, with potential implications for their differentiation fate in vivo.

immune responses, inflammation, and complement
cd16+ mo expressed significantly higher levels of mrna for the low affinity fcγ receptor fcgr3a/cd <dig>  ifn-γ-induced surface molecules ifitm <dig>  ifitm <dig> and ifitm <dig>  complement receptor c3ar <dig>  arrestin beta  <dig> , and cd <dig> . genes downregulated in cd16+ mo included those coding for the high affinity fcγ receptor fcgr1a/cd <dig>  complement receptor c1qr <dig>  ca binding proteins s100a <dig>  s100a <dig>  and s100a <dig>  phospholipase a <dig>  group vii , ig superfamily receptor trem <dig>  neutrophil cytosolic factors ncf <dig> and ncf <dig>  heparanase , chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan  <dig> , amyloid beta  precursor-like protein  <dig>  involved in turnover of mhc class i molecules  <cit> , amyloid beta  precursor protein , and aquaporin aqp <dig>  which plays a role in immunological response and bactericidal activity . these results identify complement-related molecules c3ar <dig> and cd <dig> as new markers for cd16+ mo, and c1qr <dig> as a new marker for cd16- mo.

metabolism and stress response
transcripts upregulated in cd16+ mo included genes related to protein synthesis ), protein catabolism , cathepsin c ), stress responses   <dig> , superoxide dismutase  <dig> , heat shock  <dig> kda/ <dig> kda protein  <dig> , and monoglyceride lipase ), and insulin induced gene  <dig> . genes downregulated in cd16+ mo included those coding for enzymes related to protein metabolism , microsomal glutathione s-transferase  <dig> , carboxypeptidase d , ubiquitin specific protease  <dig> , peptidylprolyl isomerase f , and n-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase /sgsh), stress responses , cytochrome p <dig>  family  <dig>  subfamily b, polypeptide  <dig> , glutathione peroxidase  <dig> , tumor necrosis factor, alpha-induced protein  <dig> , and aldehyde dehydrogenase  <dig> family ) and other enzymatic processes  and lysozyme ) . differential expression of sod <dig> and gpx <dig> in cd16+ and cd16- mo, respectively, indicates a distinct antioxidant enzymatic defense system in these mo subsets. the upregulation of wars expression in cd16+ mo suggests increased potential protein synthesis  <cit> , while ctsl and ctsc upregulation may indicate increased potential antigenic processing and antigen presentation capacity  <cit> .

signaling and signal transduction
cd16+ mo expressed significantly higher levels of transcripts for a large number of genes involved in signal transduction including the protein tyrosine phosphatase type iva, member  <dig>  and phosphoinositide-3-kinase, catalytic, gamma polypeptide . genes downregulated in cd16+ mo included those coding for the interleukin  <dig> signal transducer , g protein-coupled receptor  <dig> , jagged  <dig> , protein kinase, camp-dependent, regulatory, type ii, beta , the cd <dig> binding protein proline-serine-threonine phosphatase interacting protein  <dig> , and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase  <dig>  . thus, cd16+ and cd16- mo exhibit distinct signaling pathway activation, indicating a distinct activation/differentiation history in vivo.

cell cycle, proliferation and differentiation
cd16+ mo were distinguished from cd16- mo by upregulation of the cell cycle related genes cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1c , and metastasis suppressor  <dig> . cd16- mo preferentially expressed mrna for genes encoding the cd1d antigen , and myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen  . these results provide evidence that cd16+ mo represent a more advanced stage of differentiation compared to cd16- mo.

cytoskeleton
cd16+ were distinguished from cd16- mo by expression of a series of genes related to the cytoskeleton showing higher expression in cd16+ mo including cdc <dig> effector protein   <dig> , microtubule-associated protein  <dig> , and supervillin  and in cd16- mo including actinin, alpha  <dig> . .

transcription factors
cd16+ mo expressed significantly higher levels of mrna for several transcriptional factor genes including the macrophage transcription factor v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog b , the pleckstrin homology, sec <dig>  and coiled-coil protein-binding protein , the kruppel-like factor  <dig> , and retinoic acid receptor, alpha . in contrast, cd16- mo preferentially expressed the aryl hydrocarbon receptor  transcript . both cd16+ and cd16- mo lacked pu. <dig> expression, a transcription factor upregulated in dc  <cit> , as demonstrated by microarray analysis and rt-pcr . thus, cd16+ and cd16- mo express distinct transcription factors that may differentially regulate biological functions in vivo.

gene set enrichment analysis 
to extract further meaning from differentially expressed genes in cd16+ and cd16- mo, gsea, a knowledge based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles  <cit> , was applied to test for sets of genes that share common biological functions. enrichment scores , nominal p-values, false discovery rate , and family wise-error rate  values were generated for a large number of gene sets for gsea available on the molecular signatures database  of the broad institute. one gene set was significantly enriched in cd16- compared to cd16+ mo: haddad_hpclympho_enriched . according to msigdb, this set includes genes enriched in cd45rahilin-cd10+ versus cd45raintcd7- and cd45rahicd7hi hematopoietic progenitor cells  <cit> . four uncharacterized open reading frames upregulated in hematopoietic progenitor cells   <cit>  were significantly enriched in cd16- mo.

gsea also identified several gene sets relatively enriched in cd16+ or cd16- mo, but with a lower statistical significance likely related to the limited number of samples . these analyses showed that cd16+ mo were enriched in genes related to nk cell mediated toxicity , inositol phosphate metabolism , actin binding , and oxidative stress . in contrast, cd16- mo were enriched in genes related to hematopoietic cell lineage , receptor mediated endocytosis , arginine and proline metabolism , nontypable haemophilus influenzae  pathway , and lipid binding molecules . overall, these results provide new insights into the developmental relationship between cd16+ and cd16- mo, with cd16- mo being more closely related to hematopoietic progenitor cells and having higher endocytosis activity, while cd16+ mo being at a more advanced stage of mo differentiation with more effector functions related to antigen presentation, migration, and cytotoxicity.

pattern recognition receptor expression in cd16+ and cd16- monocytes
both mo subsets expressed tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  and tlr <dig> but not tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  and tlr <dig> mrna . considering that cd16+ mo express low levels of the lps co-receptor, cd <dig>  <cit> , and that tlr stimulation was previously implicated in myeloid differentiation  <cit> , we tested whether genes associated with tlr pathway were upregulated in these cells. however, gsea rejected this hypothesis. nonetheless, microarray results demonstrated slight downregulation of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  and tlr <dig>  together with slight upregulation of myd <dig>  a key adaptor for these tlrs  <cit> , in cd16+ compared to cd16- mo

potential imprinting for non-skin homing in cd16+ monocytes
we demonstrated increased expression of rara mrna in cd16+ compared to cd16- mo . slp- <dig> , a ra-induced target  <cit> , was significantly upregulated in cd16+ compared to cd16- mo , indicative of rara pathway activation in cd16+ mo. activation of the rara transcription factor pathway leads to loss of skin homing potential in lymphocytes via downregulation of the cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen   <cit>  and imprinting for mucosal homing  <cit> . cla expression was quantified on cd16+ and cd16- mo by facs on pbmc from healthy individuals. cla expression was undetectable on all cd16+ mo and a fraction of cd16- mo . the frequency of cla+cd16- mo was negatively correlated with the frequency of cd16+ mo . cd16+ mo express m-dc <dig>   <cit> , which was previously reported to be expressed by a subset of mucosal dc  <cit>  . cx3cr <dig> expression on cd16+ mo   <cit>  may contribute to recruitment of these cells into cx3cl <dig> expressing tissues including the gut. these results indicate that cd16+ mo, similar to ra-stimulated t-cells  <cit> , lack expression of the skin-homing addressin cla and therefore are potentially imprinted for non-skin homing. because retinoic acid  is an important factor driving myeloid differentiation  <cit> , this reprogramming of cd16+ mo homing potential may be in part a consequence of rara pathway activation.

discussion
in this study, we define transcriptional profiles of human cd16+ and cd16- monocytes  and provide new insights into their developmental relationship and biological functions. despite remarkable transcriptional similarity , a significant number of transcripts were differentially expressed , with  <dig> and  <dig> >2-fold upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in cd16+ compared to cd16- mo. differentially expressed genes related to cell-to-cell adhesion and trafficking, immune responses and inflammation, metabolism and stress response, signaling and signal transduction, cell cycle, proliferation, and differentiation, cytoskeleton, and regulation of transcription. gene set enrichment analysis  demonstrated that cd16+ mo are enriched in genes related to nk-mediated cytotoxicity, inositol phosphate metabolism, actin binding, and oxidative stress, while cd16- mo are enriched in genes related to hematopoietic cell lineage, receptor-mediated endocytosis, arginine and proline metabolism, nthi pathway, and lipid binding. the transcriptional profiles suggest that cd16+ and cd16- mo subsets originate from a common myeloid precursor, with cd16+ mo being at a more advanced stage of myeloid differentiation and having distinct biological functions in vivo.

previous studies in mice provide evidence for a developmental relationship between ly6chighccr2highgr1+cx3cr1low and ly6clowccr2lowgr1-cx3cr1high mo , with ly6clowccr2lowgr1-cx3cr1high mo being more mature and derived from ly6chighccr2highgr1+cx3cr1low mo  <cit> . likewise, studies on human mo demonstrated the ability of cd16-cx3cr1low mo to differentiate into cd16+cx3cr1high mo upon stimulation with tgf-β, il- <dig>  m-csf, or ccl <dig>  <cit> . our comparative transcriptome analysis provides further evidence for the idea that cd16- mo originate from a common granulocyte-macrophage  precursor and give rise to cd16+ mo, which are more closely related to macrophages  and dendritic cells . cd16- mo preferentially expressed granulocyte-associated transcripts , the calgranulins s100a <dig>  s100a <dig>  and s100a12), and myeloid markers , together with transcripts suggesting an increased potential for receptor-mediated endocytosis via molecules such as cd <dig> and fcgr1a/cd <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, cd16+ mo preferentially expressed mΦ 1- <dig>  cd <dig>  and c3ar)  <cit>  and dc markers   <cit> . cd16+ mo expressed higher levels of transcripts encoding the cysteine protease cathepsin l , which contributes to phagocytic-endocytic proteolysis in dc for subsequent antigen presentation  <cit> . upregulation of transcripts encoding dipeptidyl-peptidase i, ctsc  <cit>  may further enhance antigen processing by cd16+ mo or dc derived from these cells. although some studies classified cd16+ mo as dc based on their increased antigen presenting ability  <cit>  and transcriptional profile similarities  <cit> , a recent compendium analysis of transcriptional profiles demonstrated that cd16+hla-dr+ cells are more closely linked to myeloid cd14+ cells than to dc subsets in peripheral blood  <cit> . our results demonstrate that cd16+ mo share approximately 83% of their transcripts with cd16- mo, supporting the idea that these two mo subsets are developmentally related.

recruitment of cd16+ and cd16- mo into tissues is mediated via distinct molecular mechanisms  <cit> . our gene expression analysis confirms differential expression of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors previously reported to be preferentially expressed on cd16+ mo  and cd16- mo   <cit> . we also identified new cell surface markers and other molecules that are differentially expressed in these mo subsets and may influence their trafficking and migration into tissues. the tetraspanins ms4a4a and ms4a <dig>  adhesion molecules siglec <dig> and icam- <dig>  and membrane-bound chemokine cxcl <dig>  <cit>  were preferentially expressed by cd16+ mo, whereas the tetraspanin ms4a6a, adhesion molecules cd <dig> and junctional adhesion molecule like   <cit> , and chemokine receptor fpr <dig> were preferentially expressed by cd16- mo. cd <dig> and cd <dig> are involved in distinct steps of mo transendothelial migration  <cit> . expression of cxcl <dig>  a chemokine expressed by dc  <cit> , on the surface of cd16+ mo may facilitate interaction with cxcr6+ cells  and retention of cxcr6+ cells in tissues. similar to mouse and rat ccr2lowcx3cr1high mo  <cit> , cd16+ mo expressed higher levels of spn/cd <dig> , a ligand for icam- <dig>  <cit> , and the macrophage adhesion receptor sialoadhesin   <cit> . cd <dig> has both adhesive and anti-adhesive properties  <cit> , mediates dc maturation  <cit> , and contributes to regulation of immunological synapse formation  <cit> . cd <dig>  a receptor for thrombospondin- <dig> , is preferentially expressed by cd16+ mo. cd <dig> ligation selectively inhibits the development of human naive t cells into th <dig> effectors by decreasing il- <dig> and tnf-α production by mo-derived dc  <cit> . consistent with these findings, cd16- and cd16+ mo may induce th <dig> and th2-like differentiation, respectively  <cit> . however, cd16+ mo express il-12rb <dig>  which favors th <dig> polarization  <cit> , whereas cd16- mo express receptors for the th <dig> cytokines il- <dig> and il- <dig>  <cit>  and the anti-th <dig> cytokine, il- <dig>  <cit> . accordingly, the influence of cd16+ and cd16- mo on th <dig> versus th <dig> polarization of immune responses is likely to be highly dependent on the local microenvironment within tissues.

cd16+ mo expressed high levels of transcripts for rara, which controls transcription of genes involved in cell trafficking and mucosal homing. ra imprints lymphocytes with non-skin mucosal homing properties by decreasing cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen  expression  <cit>  and increasing expression of ccr <dig> and integrin beta  <dig>  two mucosal addressins  <cit> . ra also controls reciprocal differentiation of th <dig> and regulatory t cells  <cit> , modulates myeloid gene expression and differentiation  <cit> , and regulates survival and antigen presentation by dc  <cit> . consistent with our hypothesis that the rara pathway is activated in cd16+ mo, we demonstrated cla downregulation on these cells, together with upregulation of two ra-induced targets: slp- <dig>  <cit>  and cxcl <dig>  <cit> . ra induces mucosal-type dc, which produce tgf-β and thereby imprints t-cells for gut homing by inducing ccr <dig> and integrin beta  <dig>  <cit> . cd16+ mo-derived mΦ and dc constitutively produce tgf-β  <cit> , but whether they also instruct t-cells for gut homing remains to be determined.

klf <dig> mrna is expressed at very high levels and significantly upregulated in cd16+ compared to cd16- mo. klf <dig> belongs to a family of zinc-finger transcription factors that is induced by pi3k signaling  <cit>  and controls expression of several genes including those coding for cd62l, ccr <dig>  integrin beta <dig>  sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor   <cit> , and lymphotoxin beta  <cit> . ccr <dig> and cd62l are essential for migration into lymph nodes, s1p <dig> regulates t-cell thymic egress and recirculation  <cit> , and integrin beta  <dig> mediates cell recruitment into peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes  <cit> . together, these findings raise the possibility that preferential expression of klf <dig> in cd16+ mo may confer an increased potential for trafficking.

cd16+ compared to cd16- mo express very high levels of transcripts for cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1c   and metastasis suppressor  <dig> mtss <dig> . cdkn1c is a potent inhibitor of several g <dig> cyclin-dependent kinase  complexes, and negative regulator of g1/s cell cycle transition and cell proliferation  <cit> . cdkn1c  <cit>  and mtss <dig>  <cit>  are candidate tumor suppressor genes, and their high expression is consistent with the inability of mo to proliferate  <cit> . cdkn1c is induced by tgf-β  <cit> , a cytokine known to induce cd16+ mo differentiation  <cit> . thus, our results are consistent with a potential link between tgf-β pathway activation and cd16+ mo differentiation in vivo.

several transcripts related to cell activation were upregulated in cd16+ mo including ltb, tnfrsf <dig>  leukocyte specific transcript  <dig> , ifitm1- <dig>  hmox <dig>  superoxide dismutase- <dig> , tryptophanyl trna synthetase , and monoglyceride lipase , indicating increased activation of cd16+ compared with cd16- mo. lst <dig>  <cit> , hmox <dig>  <cit> , sod- <dig>  and wars are induced by stimulation with lipopolysaccharide  <cit> . the role of lst <dig> in immune regulation remains elusive. hmox <dig> modulates mo inflammatory responsiveness by decreasing lps-induced tnf and il-1β expression  <cit> . wars and indoleamine  <dig> -dioxygenase  are responsible for tryptophan use in protein synthesis and degradation, respectively  <cit> . wars was identified as a molecular marker for mo differentiation into mΦ  <cit>  and dc  <cit> . these results suggest increased activation of cd16+ compared to cd16- mo in vivo.

the cd16+ mo subset includes two subsets with distinct levels of cd <dig> expression: cd14highcd16+ and cd14lowcd16+  <cit> . cd14highcd16+ mo exhibit a phenotype intermediate between that of cd14highcd16neg and cd14lowcd16+ mo in terms of adhesion molecule  and chemokine receptor expression   <cit> . both cd14highcd16+ and cd14lowcd16+ mo contributed to the transcriptional profile of cd16+ mo in this study. the expression of some genes we identified as markers for cd16+ mo may be distinct on cd14highcd16+ and cd14lowcd16+ mo. consistent with this prediction, we demonstrated intermediate expression of cd <dig> and cd <dig> on cd14highcd16+ mo compared to cd14highcd16neg and cd14lowcd16+ mo, and high expression of cd <dig> and c3ar <dig>  similar to that on cd14highcd16- and cd14lowcd16+ mo, respectively . these findings suggest a developmental relationship between these mo subsets in which cd14highcd16neg mo, cd14highcd16+ mo, and cd14lowcd16+ mo represent sequential stages of monocyte differentiation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
comparative transcriptome analysis of cd16+ and cd16- mo indicates that cd16+ mo represent a more advanced stage of myeloid differentiation with a more mΦ – and dc-like transcription program, whereas cd16- mo are more closely related to a common myeloid precursor. given the ability of cd16+ and cd16- mo to be recruited into specific tissues via distinct mechanisms, these mo subsets are likely to give rise to dc and mΦ subpopulations with distinct phenotypes and roles in immunity and disease pathogenesis. further studies to characterize phenotypic differences between cd16+ and cd16- mo-derived dc and mΦ are relevant for development of dc-based vaccines, and will also provide a better understanding of their functional roles in immune responses, inflammation, and disease pathogenesis.
