BACKGROUND
genetic variation occurs in many different ways, ranging from large microscopically visible chromosome anomalies to single nucleotide changes. the subset of potential genetic variations, deletions, insertions, duplications, and complex multi-site variants, is collectively referred to as copy number variants   <cit> . cnvs range from approximately 50 bp to several mb in size  and might exhibit potentially larger effects through the disruption of genes and alteration of gene dosages, disruption of coding sequences and perturbation of long-range gene regulation  <cit> . in the last decade, many studies have been conducted on the distribution, function, and role of cnvs in diseases involving dna segments in the human genome . recently, genome-wide cnvs have not only been identified in humans but also in domestic animals, such as cattle , sheep  <cit> , goat  <cit> , pig , and poultry .

china has a wide variety of indigenous chicken breeds, and chicken genomics is likely to have major applications and benefits in agriculture, comparative genomics, evolutionary biology, systematics, and models of development and human disease  <cit> . previous studies have reported that cnvs are responsible for the phenotypic changes in chicken. examples of phenotypes associated with cnvs in the chicken include late feathering on chromosome z   <cit> , pea comb on gga <dig>  <cit> , dark brown plumage color on gga <dig>  <cit> , and dermal hyperpigmentation on gga <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, there is a large genetic distance between chinese and european chicken populations, which facilitates the detection of fruitful breed-specific cnvs. however, compared with humans and other model organisms, there is limited research on the extent and impact of cnvs in the chicken genome. the aim of the present study was to investigate the extent and pattern of cnvs in five characteristic chicken breeds. the cnvs detected herein are complementary to the cnv map in the chicken genome, and this information will be important for future studies associating phenotype with genome architecture.

RESULTS
genome-wide detection of cnvs
using a commercial 385 k array-based comparative genomic hybridization  genome array , we performed cnv discovery using  <dig> chicken samples from four chinese local breeds including xichuan black-bone chicken , silkie chicken , lushi chicken , and gushi chicken , and one french breed houdan chicken  . based on the wugsc <dig> /galgal <dig> genome sequence, a total of  <dig> cnvs were identified in the genomes of these chicken breeds. after eliminating probes with uncertain chromosomal loci, we identified  <dig> non-redundant cnvs for the chicken autosome gga1- <dig> and the z sex chromosome. the mean and median lengths of the cnvs were  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, respectively, ranging from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  mb in length. among these segments,  <dig> cnvs involved a dna sequence gain, while  <dig> cnvs involved a dna sequence loss. the total number of cnvs for each breed was  <dig> in xc,  <dig> in sk,  <dig> in ls,  <dig> in gs, and  <dig> in hd .figure  <dig>

after aggregating the overlapping cnvs, a total of  <dig> cnvrs across the wugsc <dig> /galgal <dig> genome sequence were identified, covering  <dig>  mb of the chicken genome and  <dig> % of the entire chicken genome. the mean and median sizes of the cnvrs were  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, respectively. most of the cnvrs  were detected in a single individual, while the remaining cnvrs  were identified in more than one individual . we identified only one cnvr  present in all the ten individuals tested. compared with previous studies in the chicken ,  <dig>  cnvrs overlapped with previously reported cnvrs , while  <dig>  cnvrs were reported for the first time. among the  <dig> overlapping cnvrs,  <dig> cnvrs have been identified in all studies, and  <dig> cnvrs have been reported in various studies .

the  <dig> cnvrs identified were present on all chicken gga1- <dig> autosomes and sex chromosome z. a total of  <dig>  cnvrs were located on chromosome 1– <dig>  chromosome  <dig> and sex chromosome z, while fewer cnvrs were located on chromosome  <dig> and chromosome  <dig>  concerning copy number status,  <dig>  cnvrs involved a sequence loss,  <dig>  cnvrs involved a sequence gain, and the remaining  <dig>  cnvrs involved both a sequence loss and a sequence gain within the same region .table  <dig>

after converting the location of the probes from galgal <dig> to galgal <dig>  according to the probe sequence,  <dig> non-redundant cnvs were identified in the five chicken breeds. the mean and median lengths of the cnvs were  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, respectively. a total of  <dig> cnvs involved a dna sequence gain, while  <dig> cnvs involved a dna sequence loss. the lengths of the cnvs ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb. the total number of cnvs for each breed was  <dig> in xc,  <dig> in sk,  <dig> in ls,  <dig> in gs, and  <dig> in hd . a total of  <dig> cnvrs were identified based on the galgal <dig> genome sequence. the length of these cnvrs ranged from  <dig>  to 320 kb, with mean or median lengths of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, respectively. concerning copy number status,  <dig>  cnvrs involved a sequence loss,  <dig>  cnvrs involved a sequence gain, and the remaining  <dig>  cnvrs involved both variations .

gene contents of the chicken cnv regions
using the biomart  data management system, we retrieved the gene content of the cnvrs. a total of  <dig> genes  completely or partially overlapped with previously identified cnvrs, including  <dig> protein-coding genes,  <dig> pseudo gene,  <dig> mirna genes, and  <dig> rrna gene. these genes were distributed among  <dig> of the  <dig> cnvrs identified, while the other cnvrs did not contain any annotated genes.

the gene ontology  analyses revealed  <dig> go terms and the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway displayed three pathways . among the  <dig> go terms, four terms were statistically significant after benjamini correction. the significant go terms primarily involved cell adhesion, transcription factor activity, sequence-specific dna binding, and transcription regulator activity . the analyses also revealed some enriched terms with marginal significance, involved in biological adhesion, pattern specification, embryonic morphogenesis, appendage development and limb development . the kegg pathway analyses indicated that the genes in the cnvrs were enriched in three pathways, involving cell adhesion molecules, hematopoietic cell lineage, and leukocyte transendothelial migration, however, these terms were not statistically significant after benjamini correction.

next, we analyzed whether our cnvrs mapped to known qtls in the chicken qtldb . because the confidence intervals for some qtls were too large, we focused on qtls with confidence intervals less than 10 mb. a comparison of the overlapping cnvrs with qtls revealed a total of  <dig> qtls in  <dig> cnvrs, affecting a wide range of traits, including body weight, body size, carcass traits, fatness traits, marek's disease-related traits, and reproductive traits .

quantitative pcr analysis of selected cnv regions
quantitative pcr  was performed to validate the acgh data at six cnvr loci . two  of the six loci served as references for no variation in copy number, while four loci  were cnvrs detected using an acgh genome array in five chicken breeds. the qpcr results indicated that all four cnv loci had greater variance than the references , suggesting that the four loci were truly cnvs.figure  <dig> 
validation through qpcr in five test chicken breeds. twenty-five samples from five breeds, gushi chicken , lushi chicken , silkie chicken , xichuan black-bone chicken  and houdan chicken , were analyzed in qpcr for the six loci. the six loci are thrsp locus , pcca locus , prlr locus , socs <dig> locus , rhacd <dig> locus  and edn <dig> locus , respectively. each dna sample was diluted to 10 ng/μl, and the concentrations were verified using a spectrophotometer. quantitative pcr analyses were processed using a standard curve method as previously described  <cit> .



the qpcr results for the thrsp locus showed minimal variations among  <dig> birds . we attributed these variations to random errors, including dna dilution errors. similar qpcr results were obtained for the pcca locus in  <dig> birds, which also showed minimal variations among birds .

in the present study, the acgh analysis revealed the prlr locus in  <dig> xc,  <dig> hd,  <dig> ls, and  <dig> gs. subsequent qpcr analyses revealed a single copy in sk, while gs, ls, and xc had variable copy numbers, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> copies. the results showed that female birds had  <dig> to  <dig> copies and males had  <dig> to  <dig> copies in hd .

moreover, the acgh assay identified the socs <dig> locus in three birds, involving a gain of copy variation. the qpcr analysis showed that the variation in copy number was far more frequent  than that identified in the acgh. gs, ls, and sk had a single copy, while hd and xc had variable copy numbers, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> copies.

the acgh assay revealed rhacd <dig> locus in  <dig> ls,  <dig> gs,  <dig> gf and  <dig> sk. the qpcr data indicated that the relative copy number for the rhacd <dig> locus was highly variable among chickens. the birds with the highest copy numbers had five times as many copies as those with the lowest copy numbers. the results of the acgh array and qpcr analyses suggested that this cnvr locus was a common variation in the autosomal region, without breed specificity .

a specific duplication of a cnvr occurred on chromosome 20at base pair positions 11111788– <dig> and 11654170– <dig> encoding six annotated functional genes including the edn <dig> gene. the acgh assay revealed two loci in  <dig> sk and  <dig> xc. the qpcr results showed that gs, ls, and hd had a single copy number, and the average copy number for sk and xc was approximately  <dig> and  <dig> -fold, respectively, higher than that of these three breeds . to confirm this result, we examined the copy numbers of  <dig> chickens  . similar qpcr results were obtained for the edn <dig> locus. to determine the copy numbers in heterozygotes , the genomic copy number was estimated using qpcr for three genotypes. the qpcr analysis confirmed the duplication of the edn <dig> loci in the fmfm genotype with an estimated copy number of approximately 2-fold that of wild-type individuals , while the heterozygous genotype  likely involved a  <dig> -fold duplication .figure  <dig>

discussion
local chinese chicken breeds are considered important genetic resources because of their high product quality, favorable flavor, and strong disease resistance. here, using a tiling oligonucleotide acgh approach, we reported the cnv survey among five unrelated characteristic chicken breeds. the number of non-redundant cnvs and cnvrs in the wugsc <dig> /galgal <dig> genome sequence was  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, and  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, in galgal <dig>  both the numbers of non-redundant cnvs and cnvrs were less in galgal <dig> than in galgal <dig> because some galgal <dig> probe sequences could not be successfully converted to galgal <dig> probe sequences. the number of cnvs and cnvrs reported were much fewer than those identified in mammals and humans.

a comparison of the cnvrs in the five breeds indicated fewer cnvs and cnvrs in hd than in the other four chicken breeds in china, and cnvr-gains were more frequent than cnvr-losses  in hd. this observation might reflect the fact that the hd is different from the other four local chinese chicken breeds in origin, appearance, and production performance.

the estimated cumulative cnvr length of  <dig>  mb  was relatively long compared with that reported in recent studies  <cit> , but lower expected when considering the sample size. indeed, crooijmans et al.  <cit>  reported that cnvrs represented almost  <dig> % of the chicken genome when samples from  <dig> animals were used for testing. this difference might reflect the limited cnv coverage of the platform used in the present study, resulting in a significant underestimation of real cnvs in chickens because a limited number of individuals were surveyed. thus, a greater number of birds should be examined to obtain a comprehensive picture of chicken cnvs. furthermore, the incompleteness of the chicken genome assembly, suggests that a significant portion of the genome was not surveyed. the entire w chromosome was excluded from the analysis, and all probes assigned to chrun and other random chromosomes were also excluded.

to retrieve the information and annotation for the cnvrs based on the newest chicken genome sequence, distinct from previous studies on the gene contents of chicken cnvrs, we converted the location of the probes from galgal <dig> to galgal <dig>  according to the probe sequence, and the gene contents were processed using the galgal <dig> genome. the gene content analysis detected  <dig> ensembl genes among the  <dig> identified cnvrs. among these,  <dig> protein-coding genes, such as prlr and mtap of chrz, rhacd <dig> of chr <dig>  slmo <dig>  tubb <dig>  and edn <dig> of chr <dig>  etc., were annotated and reported in previous studies  <cit> . notably, two cnvrs  were identified on chromosome  <dig>  the distance between the loci was  <dig>  kb. the cnvr chr20: 11111788– <dig> has been associated with dermal hyperpigmentation in chickens  <cit> . in the present study, six annotated functional genes encoding edn <dig>  zinc finger protein  <dig> , slowmo homolog  <dig> , tubulin beta- <dig> , cathepsin z , partial th1-like  , and one mirna were identified in this cnvr. consistently, an association between edn <dig> and melanoblast proliferation has been previously reported in chickens .

in addition, we also identified a new cnvr involving a sequence loss of  <dig>  kb in the sk . this locus contains the gene encoding sortilin-related receptor  . the sorl <dig> protein belongs to a super family of low-density lipoprotein receptors that bind apolipoprotein e and have been implicated in cholesterol metabolism  <cit> . in a previous study, we showed that the contents of cholesterol in silkie eggs was higher than that in lohmann and lushi eggs  <cit> , suggesting a correlation between the cholesterol content and the loss of  <dig>  kb of the sorl <dig> gene. therefore, this cnvr is worth further investigation.

the data obtained from go term and pathway analyses and an examination of overlapping qtls in the chicken qtldb suggested that these genes function in numerous molecular functions, indicating the potential of these genes as promising resources for exploring the genetic basis of phenotypic variation within and among breeds. specifically,  <dig> cnvrs partially or completely overlap with  <dig> qtls, and these qtls are involved in many important traits in chickens, including growth traits, carcass traits, meat quality traits, reproductive traits, and disease-related traits. thus, the cnvrs identified herein might represent valuable resources for studying chinese chicken genome diversity, including the structural variation mechanisms associated with chicken traits. together with snps, cnvs will be an important complement to molecular marker and genome-wide association studies, and these variations might account for some of the missing heritability of complex traits  <cit> .

the presence of two copies of the prlr locus has been associated with the slow feathering phenotype, and the lack of one copy has been associated with the early feathering phenotype  <cit> . subsequent qpcr analyses of  <dig> female birds showed that a single copy of this gene in sk,  <dig> to  <dig> copies in gs and ls, and  <dig> to  <dig> copies in xc. the female sk exhibited the slow feathering phenotype and the female xc, ls and gs showed both slow and fast feathering phenotypes. moreover, in hd, the results showed that female birds have  <dig> to  <dig> copies and male birds have  <dig> to  <dig> copies. we propose that the differences in the copy numbers might reflect a gain of  <dig> prlr loci in hd. thus, we provide the first report that a gain of  <dig> prlr loci also induced late feathering in hd. however, further studies are needed to examine the reliability of this finding. the prlp locus is located on the z chromosome, and because homozygote  individuals are male and heterozygote  individuals are female, these results showed that the copy number of male birds is twice that of female birds. the results of a separate qpcr assay in hd were consistent with this idea. a sex-linked late feathering allele k containing  <dig> copies of the prlr locus has been introduced into commercial flocks and used widely for sexing hatchlings. this k allele is incompletely dominant to the early feathering k+ allele containing one copy of the prlr locus. suppliers typically cross k+k+ males with kw females to generate female progeny with the early feathering phenotype k+w containing one copy of prlr, while the male progeny have a late feathering phenotype kk+ containing three copies of prlr.

we observed that sk and xc were the only two breeds to show cnvs at the edn <dig> locus. dorshorst et al.  <cit>  reported that fm results from an inverted duplication of two genomic regions, each greater than 100 kb, located on chromosome  <dig>  resulting in the increased expression of the edn <dig> gene. we concluded that the dermal hyperpigmentation of these two chinese local chicken breeds also resulted from a cnv in this region. sk and xc are closely distributed in southeast china, likely reflecting the fact that these two breeds originated from the same place or have traits that were purposely bred into different strains. to explain the observation that the copy number in sk was higher than that in xc, we propose that both heterozygotes  and homozygotes  are present in xc. using qpcr analysis, dorshorst et al.  <cit>  confirmed the duplication of both genomic regions in fm birds, with an estimated copy number of approximately  <dig> -2-fold that of wild-type individuals, suggesting that some fm birds were likely heterozygous for a mutant allele comprising a 2-fold duplication. this result suggests that this locus might be a molecular marker for the selection of dark skin color in poultry production.

CONCLUSIONS
here, we reported a genome-wide analysis of cnvs in five chicken breeds using an acgh array. the mapping of cnvs will contribute to association studies of economic performance. among the four cnvrs selected for validation through qpcr, all four variations exhibited the expected copy number differences. the association between edn <dig> and melanoblast proliferation was further confirmed in the present study. additional, in the present study, we report a new cnvr , encoding sorl <dig> gene, with a copy number change only in black-bone chickens. these results provide a preliminary foundation for investigating the association between various phenotypes and cnvs. future studies are required to assess the functional significance of cnvs and determine the impact of these variations on economic traits in chicken.
