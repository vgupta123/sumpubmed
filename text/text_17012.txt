BACKGROUND
the number of genomes sequenced continues to increase. these sequences are usually decoded for one individual, but their application is considered for the entire species and even within the genus. sequencing projects have been completed for a number of herbaceous plants, namely thale cress  and rice , while for woody species, such as black cottonwood poplar  and papaya , a draft assembly is available. the high commercial value of grape  gave rise to the funding of two sequencing programs on a near-homozygous line  <cit>  and a highly heterozygous cultivar  <cit> . the genome sequencing of this latter genotype resulted in several thousand polymorphisms and therefore provided a good model to study the transferability of its polymorphism content across individuals within v. vinifera and within vitis.

grape is one of the oldest and most important perennial crops in the world. its cultivation is concentrated in regions with a mediterranean-type climate but it is grown in most temperate regions. the vast majority of the world's grapes are cultivars of v. vinifera subsp. sativa , which are used as a source of fresh fruit and raisins, and fermented to make wine and distilled beverages. cultivated grapes were domesticated from the wild v. vinifera subsp. sylvestris  <cit> , which was once distributed widely from the middle east to western europe  <cit> . this range was greatly restricted by the introduction of the mildew diseases and grape phylloxera from north america in the mid-1800s, to which v. vinifera subsp. sylvestris is highly susceptible  <cit> . the genus vitis is unique among the  <dig>  in plant species . the first examples of this process in grape utilized rapd and aflp markers, which were converted into more useful scar markers . more recently, ssr or microsatellite markers have been successfully employed in marker-assisted breeding for table grapes  <cit> , wine grapes and rootstocks  <cit> . because of their multiallelic and reproducible nature, ssrs have been extensively used in mapping studies  and for genome anchoring  <cit> . to date more than  <dig> grape ssrs are publicly available and are described in the ncbi databases dbsts and unists .

snps, dichotomous  markers, have been developed in many species  including grape where they were derived from bac and est libraries and used successfully to build genetic maps  <cit>  and to anchor them to a physical map  <cit> . in addition, snps identified in grape gene sequences have been employed in genetic diversity studies  <cit>  and linkage disequilibrium analyses  <cit> . moreover, the recent decoding of the grape genome sequence in the heterozygous pinot noir cultivar provided the grape research community with  <dig> , <dig> snps from coding and non-coding regions  <cit> . different strategies have been applied in grape for snp detection and genotyping, including low to mid  <cit>  and high throughput  <cit>  methods. however, most of the snp discovery and application has been limited to v. vinifera. the use and transferability of snps across v. vinifera has been restricted to a few cultivars  <cit>  and to a few wild forms  <cit> . in addition to the development of markers for mas, knowledge on transferability of snps is required to allow the identification of useful alleles for diversity and association studies. to date, a comprehensive study of snp use and transferability across species within vitis has never been attempted.

the primary goal of this study was to assess the use and transferability of snps discovered from the heterozygous pinot noir  <cit>  within the species v. vinifera and within the genera vitis and muscadinia to validate the use of pinot noir genome-based snp markers for future grape improvement programs using diverse genetic resources. this study was performed by genotyping  <dig> snps through the snplex™ genotyping system  and by confirming the snplex results sequencing  <dig>  regions on  <dig> accessions.

methods
plant material and genomic dna extraction
genomic dna  of  <dig> genotypes was isolated from  <dig> to  <dig> mg of young leaves. after freeze-drying, leaf material was ground using the mm  <dig> mixer mill  and dna extraction was performed using the dneasy  <dig> plant mini kit  according to the manufacturer's protocol.

the set of  <dig> genotypes consisted of: i)  <dig> v. vinifera cultivars housed at iasma , including the sequenced pinot noir clone entav 115; this set included  <dig> varieties related to pinot noir at the 1st degree level ,  <dig> varieties related to pinot noir at the 2nd degree level  and  <dig> varieties unrelated to pinot noir; ii)  <dig> accessions of v. vinifera subsp. sylvestris housed at vassal inra-montpellier ; and iii)  <dig> non-vinifera accessions housed at uc davis , representing  <dig> vitis species and  <dig> accessions of m. rotundifolia .

whole genome amplification
ten ng of gdna were amplified by whole genome amplification   <cit>  using the genomiphi v <dig> dna amplification kit  according to the manufacturer's protocol. the success of the wga reaction and the absence of product in the negative control samples were assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis.

snplex assay and data analysis
the snplex  assay was carried out on  <dig> μl  of fragmented genomiphi amplified gdna  diluted to a final volume of  <dig> μl and air dried in the dark.

six snp sets, for a total of  <dig> validated electronic snps , were chosen based on the number of validated snps over the total esnps in the pinot noir clone entav  <dig>  <cit>  . the snplex analysis was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol modified for the amount of pcr product used in the hybridization cycles . the samples were run on a  <dig> × l dna analyzer  and the data were analyzed using the gene mapper v. <dig>  software . genotype analysis was performed based on the snplex_rules_ <dig> method following factory default settings.

sequencing analysis
ca.  <dig> bp  of flanking region for each of the  <dig> target snps  were sequenced in all  <dig> genotypes in order to confirm the snplex results and to discover all possible polymorphic sites . the selected  <dig> snps were scattered across the  <dig> grapevine chromosomes. twenty of them were present in coding  regions and  <dig> corresponded to non-coding  regions . in addition, ca.  <dig> bp  encompassing each of three target snps  were sequenced in all  <dig> genotypes in order to investigate the short-range primer regions and to find additional mutations.

for both short- and long-sequencings, pcr primers were designed based on the pinot noir genomic sequence  <cit> , using the primer <dig> software  <cit>  according to the following criteria: i) forward and reverse primers 200– <dig> bp or  <dig> bp upstream and downstream in respect to the target snp; ii) primer size between  <dig> and  <dig> bases; iii) primer melting temperature  between  <dig> and 61°c; iv) alignment score and global alignment score for self-complementarity and complementarity between primer pairs ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> .

subsequently, the  <dig> genomic regions were amplified in all  <dig> genotypes. pcr reactions were assembled using the following conditions: 1– <dig> ng of gdna, 1× pcr buffer ,  <dig>  mm each dntp,  <dig>  μm of each primer,  <dig> u hotstartaq dna polymerase , and water to a final volume of  <dig>  μl. the dna amplifications were performed using a  <dig> min initial denaturation/activation step, followed by  <dig> cycles at 94°c for  <dig> sec, 57°c for  <dig> sec, and 72°c for  <dig> min, with a final extension step of  <dig> min at 72°c. pcr products were assessed by electrophoresis in  <dig> % agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. in order to remove unincorporated dntps and primers during the amplification reaction, the positive amplicons were purified through multiscreen384pcr cleanup plate .

the sequencing of the pcr products was carried out using the bigdye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit v <dig>   as follows:  <dig> μl of pcr purified products, 1x sequencing buffer,  <dig>  μm of forward primer,  <dig> μl of bigdye terminator and deionized water to a final volume of  <dig> μl. the sequencing reactions were performed using a  <dig> min initial denaturation step, followed by  <dig> cycles at 96°c for  <dig> sec, 50°c for  <dig> sec and 60°c for  <dig> min and then purified from unincorporated primer and bigdye excess through multiscreen384seq sequencing reaction cleanup plate . capillary electrophoresis of the purified products was performed on a  <dig> × l dna analyzer . dna sequence electropherograms were aligned with the pregap4/gap <dig> software package  and used to scan all polymorphic sites in the  <dig> genotypes.

RESULTS
snplex assay and data analysis
out of the  <dig> analysed esnps on  <dig> genotypes,  <dig> satisfied the quality value  and were therefore considered successful, while  <dig> regions were unsuccessful. the technical transferability was thus of 61%  and corresponded to snps with homologous flanking sequences.

the transferability in the strict sense, namely those snps that maintained the heterozygous state, was analysed based on the four grapevine sub-groups . this transferability was  <dig> % in v. vinifera cultivars,  <dig> % in v. vinifera wild forms, only  <dig> % in non-vinifera vitis species, and 0% in m. rotundifolia .

* number of heterozygous sites in each genotype group/total number of analyzed sites in each genotype group

for each snp locus, the minor allele frequency  value was also evaluated at the three vitis levels . the analysis of maf values showed that only  <dig> % of the  <dig> snps displayed mafs <  <dig>  in v. vinifera cultivars,  <dig> % in v. vinifera wild forms, and  <dig> % in non-vinifera vitis species, whereas  <dig> % of  <dig> snps displayed mafs ≥  <dig>  in v. vinifera cultivars,  <dig> % in v. vinifera wild forms, and  <dig> % in non-vinifera vitis species . three highly informative subsets of markers , consisting of  <dig> snps for v. vinifera cultivars,  <dig> snps for v. vinifera wild forms, and  <dig> snps for non-vinifera vitis species, were developed . the first subset showed  <dig> v. vinifera cultivar specific snps, the second had  <dig> v. vinifera wild form specific snps, and the third revealed  <dig> non-vinifera vitis species specific snp ;  <dig> fully shared snp marker  among the three subsets was identified .

sequencing analysis and mutation survey
in the sequencing analysis, amplicons corresponding to five snps  amplified in pinot noir but failed to amplify in 98% the studied genotypes. the remaining  <dig> successful regions –  <dig> corresponding to coding regions and  <dig> to non-coding regions – were sequenced in  <dig> vitis genotypes. the two of m. rotundifolia accessions failed to amplify for all  <dig> regions. the identification of snps and in/del  was performed along the staden package alignments and resulted in the following conclusions:

i)  <dig> snps were discovered in the v. vinifera cultivars  with an average of one snp every  <dig> bp . of these  <dig> snps,  <dig> %  corresponded to transitions  and  <dig> %  to transversions . in addition,  <dig> homozygous  and  <dig> heterozygous in/dels  were identified; when present, the average in/del frequency was of one every  <dig> bp.

ii)  <dig> snps were found in the v. vinifera wild forms  with an average of one snp every  <dig> bp . of these  <dig> snps,  <dig> %  corresponded to transitions and  <dig> %  to transversions. in addition,  <dig> homozygous  and  <dig> heterozygous in/dels  were discovered; when present, the average in/del frequency was of one every  <dig> bp.

iii)  <dig> snps were identified in the non-vinifera vitis species  with an average of one snp every  <dig> bp . of these  <dig> snps,  <dig> %  corresponded to transitions and  <dig> %  to transversions. in addition,  <dig> homozygous  and  <dig> heterozygous in/dels  were identified; when present, the average in/del frequency was of one every  <dig> bp .

considering the three genotype groups, the size of the amplicons was generally conserved, except for a few non-vinifera vitis species cases where short insertions  were detected.

the observed heterozygosity  was computed for each genotype based on all mutations  identified in the  <dig> resequenced loci. the v. vinifera cultivar granoir  was the most heterozygous , while the accessions of v. monticola, v. biformis and v. shuttleworthii  were the least . the level of polymorphism could not be assessed in the two accessions of m. rotundifolia since the sequencing failed.

validation of the snplex genotyping system by sequencing
the sequencing analysis of the  <dig> snp regions confirmed the genotype  of pinot noir identified by snplex, which was in accord with pindo et al.  <cit> . when the  <dig>  sequencing data points  were considered,  <dig>  were inconsistent with the snplex results. of these incongruous data  <dig> occurred in v. vinifera cultivars,  <dig> in v. vinifera wild forms, and  <dig> in non-vinifera vitis species. furthermore,  <dig> occurred in coding regions while  <dig> were present in non-coding regions. these data grouped in six classes: i) class i:  <dig>  were homozygous after sequencing, while snplex analysis indicated they were heterozygous; ii) class ii:  <dig>  were heterozygous and one or more snps were identified close to the target snp by sequencing, while snplex analysis indicated they were homozygous; iii) class iii:  <dig>  were detected as heterozygous and no additional snp was found close to target snp by sequencing, while these sites were identified as homozygous after snplex analysis; iv) class iv:  <dig>  were homozygous after snplex analysis, while sequencing detected them as heterozygous with the presence of a third allele in respect to the pinot noir genotype; v) class v:  <dig>  was homozygous after snplex analysis, while sequencing detected it as homozygous in respect to the pinot noir genotype; vi) class vi:  <dig>  were homozygous after snplex analysis, while sequencing detected them as homozygous for the other allele variant present in the pinot noir genotype.

discussion
this study was intended to validate the use of  <dig> snp markers, developed from the heterozygous genome of pinot noir clone entav  <dig>  the transferability of these markers was assessed across v. vinifera cultivars, wild forms of v. vinifera, and non-vinifera vitis species to validate their utility as informative tools for marker-assisted selection in grape improvement programs, diversity studies, association analysis and mapping purposes.

snp transferability and informativeness
snps are more abundant in the genome and are more stably inherited than other genetic markers  <cit> . snp detection does not involve gel electrophoresis, which is relatively slow and labour intensive, thereby it is more suitable for high throughput genotyping methods  <cit> . in addition to the snplex™ genotyping system  used in this study, a wide array of technologies have now been developed, including chip-based  and beadarray  technologies, all providing efficient and reliable methods for large scale snp surveys.

snps can be used for a range of purposes, including rapid identification of cultivars, construction of ultra high-density genetic maps, and association studies between a given genotype and a trait of interest  <cit> . in this study snp transferability in the strict sense was tested because each of the analysed vitis species is highly heterozygous and also because for several purposes  only heterozygous markers can be used. in this work it was found that  <dig> % of the polymorphisms derived from pinot noir are maintained among unrelated v. vinifera cultivars, which is consistent with a survey across the cultivars pinot noir, syrah, grenache, cabernet sauvignon, and riesling  <cit> . the heterozygous state transferability of  <dig> % between pinot noir and genotypes related to pinot noir at the 1st degree level was expected, without prior knowledge of the other parental genotypic state. between pinot noir and genotypes related to pinot noir at the 2nd degree level, a snp transferability of  <dig> % was obtained according to the possibilities derived from three unknown genotypic states in the phylogenetic tree. these results confirm the utility and the robustness of snp analysis when dealing with v. vinifera cultivars, particularly in consideration of the cost and labour required for a resequencing strategy. however, the transferability of these snps to wild forms of v. vinifera was lower , which will impact their use for association studies or selective sweep identification, and the transferability was even lower  in non-vinifera vitis species, which will affect their use for comparative mapping . this latter result suggests that when working with non-vinifera vitis species it will be important to employ a resequencing strategy while noting that the homology in priming sites was quite good. the fact that the pcr primers  developed based on a v. vinifera cultivar  matched the sequence of most vitis species provides a valuable tool to get snp and haplotype information useful for future diversity and association studies.

marker informativeness can be evaluated using a number of different criteria. the number of alleles is the most basic criterion, where markers with a larger number of alleles are more likely to be polymorphic for any given germplasm set. minor allele frequency  is a measure used to assess informativeness of snp loci and is related to expected heterozygosity where the number of alleles is two, as is usually the case for snps  <cit>  and was confirmed in this study. in fact, the occurrence of a triallelic snp was very rare and was in accord to a previous snp based study in grape  <cit> .

snps with maf values ≥  <dig>  or  <dig>  are considered common and useful for most applications , whereas snps with maf values ≥  <dig>  are the most informative and transferable across various genotypes  <cit> . in this study, the three highly informative  subsets of transferable markers developed for v. vinifera cultivars , for wild forms of v. vinifera , and for non-vinifera vitis species  represent new and valuable genomic tools for tasks such as marker-assisted breeding and genetic mapping. for genetic mapping one important criterion is that markers are transferable among pedigrees and ideally among species  <cit> . in the present study, of  <dig> snps only  <dig> marker was fully shared among all vitis subgroups, in addition to pair wise shared snps. there were indeed  <dig> snps specific to v. vinifera cultivars,  <dig> specific to wild forms of v. vinifera, and  <dig> specific to non-vinifera vitis species, which should be useful for accession characterization  .

additional transferability tests of these  <dig> snp markers, developed based on the highly heterozygous pinot noir clone entav  <dig>  <cit> , were carried out in silico against the near-homozygous pn <dig> genome sequence  <cit> . as expected, all the snp regions were homozygous in pn <dig> and the location of most of these was conserved between the two genomes .

snplex validation through sequencing
the snplex genotyping system is a comprehensive solution for medium to large-scale genotyping studies, such as fine scale mapping, association analysis and marker-assisted breeding. based on oligonucleotide ligation/polymerase chain reaction, it uses capillary electrophoresis to separate selectively amplified gene regions, reports easy-to-survey cluster plots, and manages large numbers of datasets  <cit> . although the efficiency of 61% was good in this study, 39% of the assays failed. this percentage of failed assays is dependent on different assay-specific factors, such as dna quality and dna/probe interaction, and is slightly higher than in other snplex genotyping studies . one possible factor could be the multiple taxonomic levels compared in this study  while other studies have used more simplified study sets.

using the same approach as reported by pindo et al.  <cit> , snplex data were checked in  <dig> regions by sequencing. all data were confirmed, except for a few  discrepancies. most of these discrepancies  reflected a preferential annealing of pcr primers caused by polymorphism  in the pcr priming site, which was identified by sequencing. preferential amplification of one allele is a phenomenon widely described in the literature and it is expected to increase with the use of genetically diverse study sets , and most of the cases were detected in assays of vitis species. the remaining cases  were of the greatest interest, because they represented inconsistencies due to snplex failure, and limitations of this genotyping system. possible explanations of the observed discrepancies may be: a preferential ligation of one snplex probe, given an additional snp close to the target snp ; a ligation of only one snplex probe since the actual second allele is different from that of the reference pinot noir genotype ; a non-specific snplex probe ligation , even though a sequencing mistake could not be excluded . to support these hypotheses, a long-range sequencing of three snp regions was performed in all  <dig> vitis genotypes. the results validated the class i hypothesis, given the identification of snps and in/dels in the short-range sequencing primer region, and confirmed all the previous short-range sequencing results.

finally, no significant positive relationship was found when correlating snplex/sequencing inconsistencies  to the average snp and in/del frequency in each resequenced region  and the reliability of the snplex assay in a genetically diversified sample was confirmed.

frequency of the snps
the snp frequency detected by the short-range sequencing of the  <dig> regions found that cultivars of v. vinifera have one snp for every  <dig> bp in coding and every  <dig> bp in non-coding regions. the results in coding regions match reports for other v. vinifera cultivars . other studies have found lower frequencies in non-coding regions , but their samples were chosen to represent greater diversity. the frequency of one snp every  <dig> bp of coding and every  <dig> bp in non-coding regions in the wild forms of v. vinifera were not comparable to a previous study of  <dig> v. vinifera cultivars and  <dig> wild forms of v. vinifera  <cit> , emphasizing the dependency of these types of data on the chosen set of germplasm. the non-vinifera vitis species had frequencies of one snp every  <dig> bp in coding and every  <dig> bp in non-coding regions. these coding region results are in accord with values reported for v. riparia , but no comparison exist for non-coding regions innon-vinifera vitis species. snps were more prevalent in non-coding regions than in coding regions in all of the vitis groups. this is in accord with reports for the heterozygous pinot noir sequence where coding and non-coding regions demonstrated different degrees of polymorphism .

in most organisms studied to date, snps are more prevalent in the non-coding regions of the genome, in fact the frequency of snp distribution has been shown to vary not only among species, but also within each genome  <cit> . the snps detected in this study were primarily due to base transitions , which is consistent with previous results in grape  <cit>  and in other organisms  <cit> . in addition to snps, in/dels were also detected. the heterozygous in/dels were more frequent than the homozygous in/dels in each of the three vitis groups. no substantial difference in in/del occurrence was detected between coding and non-coding regions of each group, although this result is highly influenced by the chosen regions. there has not yet been a comprehensive study of in/del distribution in vitis to which the results of this study can be compared. the pinot noir heterozygous genome has an average frequency of one in/del every  <dig> bp  <cit> , which corresponds to the results reported for the three vitis groups.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, using this snplex application and corroboration from the sequencing analysis, the informativeness  of snp markers from the heterozygous grape cultivar pinot noir is validated in v. vinifera, has a more limited application for wild forms of this species, and has no direct application for non-vinifera vitis species the snplex technology was again validated as a robust method for rapid analysis of a limited number of snps on a large number of plants. although additional snps could be used, the snps developed in this study will be very useful for accession identification and genomic-research assisted breeding at the v. vinifera level.
