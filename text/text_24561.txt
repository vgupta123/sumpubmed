BACKGROUND
twist <dig> is essential in embryological morphogenesis, mesoderm patterning and development. the protein is highly conserved from drosophila to humans. in vertebrates, twist <dig> is involved in cell type determination and differentiation during myogenesis, cardiogenesis, neurogenesis  <cit> , hematopoiesis  <cit>  and osteogenesis  <cit> . twist <dig> is a basic helix-loop-helix  transcription factor  in which the basic dna-binding region is followed by a dimerization region composed of two amphipathic α-helices separated by a loop domain. twist <dig> forms either homo- or heterodimers with other bhlh proteins and binds to short conserved sequences called e-boxes  in promoter regions, regulating the transcription of target genes  <cit> .

the dimer partner choice is a critical factor in determining twist <dig> activity in both flies and vertebrates  <cit> . in mammals, the transcription of thrombospondin is induced by heterodimers of twist <dig> with e2a , whereas homodimers of twist <dig> up-regulate the transcription of fgfr <dig> and periostin. in vitro assays have shown that twist1/e2a heterodimers bind dna more efficiently than their homodimers  <cit> , and this association also protects twist <dig> from ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation  <cit> . the twist1/e2a heterodimer also represses osteoblast differentiation by downregulating the expression of cdkn1a , an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases  <cit> . it has been shown that heterodimers of myod with e <dig> or e <dig> bind to the e-box sequence more efficiently than e <dig> or even e <dig> homodimers  <cit> . as only the heterodimers of the myogenic bhlh protein with the ubiquitous e2a protein are able to activate muscle-specific gene expression and differentiation, it is very important to ensure that only these heterodimers, and not e2a protein homodimers, bind to the relevant e-box sites. the myogenic bhlh proteins do not form homodimers efficiently. to compete with the e2a protein homodimers, the heterodimers must have a higher affinity for the binding site. however, this does not mean that e2a protein homodimers are of no use. the e2a proteins in b cells may be unique in their ability to bind dna as homodimers. in muscle cells and pancreatic cells, they clearly prefer to bind dna as heterodimers  <cit> .

null mutations of twist <dig> in drosophila result in embryonic lethality because of the complete absence of mesoderm, and homozygous knock-out mice die at e <dig> - <dig>  presenting a failure of neural tube closure and defects in the head mesenchyme, branchial arches, somites and limb buds  <cit> . mice that are heterozygous for twist <dig> null mutations display a phenotype that is similar to a human hereditary disorder called saethre-chotzen syndrome . humans with twist <dig> gene germ-line haploinsufficiency suffer from premature fusion of cranial sutures, skull deformations, limb abnormalities and facial dysmorphism  <cit> .

more than  <dig> different mutations in the twist <dig> gene have been identified in unrelated scs patients and cluster in the bhlh coding sequence, either truncating or disrupting the transcription factor  <cit> . approximately 75% of these mutations are single base pair substitutions that either create premature termination codons or substitute highly conserved residues in the bhlh region. the first type of mutation is represented mainly by nonsense mutations that are upstream to or within the bhlh motif. these mutations produce truncated proteins that rapidly degrade. the second type of mutations are missense mutations that involve the helix i or ii region, creating proteins that fail to heterodimerize and which then become abnormally located in the cytoplasm  <cit> . three missense mutations described by el ghouzzi  <cit> , arg118cys , ser144arg  and lys145glu , are important because they lead to a loss of dna binding for the twist/e <dig> heterodimer and, as a result, impair twist <dig> activity.

the three-dimensional  structure of the twist <dig> protein has not yet been solved experimentally, and as the structure and function of a protein are intimately correlated, the elucidation of the 3d structure of twist <dig> could allow function prediction studies and the possibility of studying mutation effects, dynamic behavior under different conditions, and rational drug design. given that only a limited number of proteins have had their 3d structures solved, theoretical methods, such as ab initio or comparative modeling, would appear to be fast and reliable methods for addressing this issue.

because of the importance of twist <dig> in the regulation of embryonic development, its substantial relationship with scs and the lack of an experimentally solved structure for this protein, we performed comparative modeling for the twist <dig> bhlh region for both the homodimer and heterodimer with e <dig>  these are important for dna binding in the promoter region of target genes, and we evaluated their behavior in aqueous solution using molecular dynamics simulations. three mutations that promote dna binding failure, r118c, s144r and k145e, were also studied.

methods
twist1-bhlh dimer structure construction
the human twist <dig> sequence was obtained from the international protein index  database and was analyzed to identify the conserved domains and secondary structure using the eukaryotic linear motif  resource for functional sites in proteins  <cit>  and globplot <dig>  <cit> , respectively. the globplot <dig> parameters that were used to suggest a disordered region were examined using the russel/linding propensity algorithm, which is based on the hypothesis that the tendency of amino acids to be disordered can be expressed by the difference between the propensity to be a “random coil” versus a regular “secondary structure”, as defined by dssp. a search for twist <dig> homology sequences to identify a template for comparative modeling was performed using the blastp program  with the blosum <dig> comparison matrix and the rscb protein databank  <cit> . template selection was based on a high percentage of coverage combined with the best levels for identity and similarity. sequence alignment between twist <dig> and the selected template was performed using the clustalw <dig> program  <cit>  and the default parameters for the local alignment.

the three-dimensional  models for the twist <dig> homodimer , twist1/e <dig> heterodimer  and monomeric twist <dig> mutated models r118c, s144r and k145e were built using the modeller 9v <dig> package  <cit> . one hundred models were randomly generated from the template structure for each model . the model with the lowest objective function score, which is the sum of all of the restraints, was subjected, by modeller scripts, to a root mean square deviation  analysis taking the constraints of the template as a reference. optimization was performed using the variable target function method  <cit>  and employing the conjugate gradient algorithm, along with molecular dynamics with simulated annealing, to relax the models. comparative modeling using the modeller program was performed with a desktop computer with an intel® dual core™ cpu  in a windows operating system environment.

model analysis
the models were subjected to detailed evaluation and were checked for possible errors using the tools that were available for structural assessment at the swissmodel workspace  <cit> . qmean <dig>  <cit>  estimates the global model quality and returns a pseudo-energy value, which can be used to compare and rank alternative models of the same target, with the best model represented by the lowest predicted energy. procheck assesses the stereochemical quality of a protein by analyzing ramachandran plots  <cit> . dfire is an all-atom statistical potential analysis that aids in the evaluation of non-bonding atomic interactions. it generates pseudo-energy values for the entire model that reflect its quality. dfire can be used for ranking alternative predictions of the same target. the lowest pseudo-energy values indicate models that are closer to the native conformation  <cit> . the qmean z-score corresponds to a measurement of the absolute quality of a model, providing an estimation of the “degree of nativeness” of structural features that are observed in a model, and describes the chance that a given model is of a quality that is comparable to experimental structures. models with low quality are expected to have strongly negative qmean z-scores  <cit> .

molecular dynamics simulation and analysis
molecular dynamics  simulations were performed using the gromacs package v.  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  according to the following procedures. first, the best homology model for the dimers was inserted into a 60 Å x 60 Å x 80 Å tip4p  <cit>  solvated orthorhombic box, and the system was neutralized by adding negatively charged cl- counter ions at random positions. all of the simulations were performed using the opls-aa  force field  <cit> . periodic boundary conditions were applied in all directions. the final configuration of all of the systems is described in additional file 1: table s <dig>  to remove highly repulsive contacts, the system was submitted to  <dig> steps of energy minimization using the steepest descent method with gromacs program. all of the bond lengths were constrained with the lincs algorithm. non-bonded interactions were taken into account using the 6– <dig> lennard-jones potential, using a cut-off radius of 14 Å and a pme electrostatic treatment with a 10 Å radius for the coulomb interactions. all of the md simulations were performed in the gibbs ensemble at 300 k and 1 atm using the berendsen algorithm. the simulations were conducted in two steps: equilibration and trajectory collection. for the equilibration stage, 1 ns was performed with all atomic protein positions restrained. the second step was a simulation without restraints, performed for 50 ns. in both stages of the simulation, a 2-fs time step was applied  <cit> . all calculations were carried out on an intel core i <dig> cpu  machine, and the gromacs program ran under an mpi protocol with the jobs distributed to  <dig> processors.

trajectories for both homo- and heterodimers in aqueous solution were analyzed to obtain structural and dynamic properties using the gromacs analysis tools package, including the interaction potential energy between the monomers of the dimers, root mean square fluctuation of the residues , root mean square deviation  of the monomer backbone and for each region, radius of gyration  of the monomer backbone and each region, secondary structure prediction using the dssp program for the dimers, minimum distance between the centers of mass between regions, variation of the solvent accessible surface area  and collective motions  during the simulation time. the porcupine plots were generated by the dynatraj webserver  <cit>  and plotted using vmd software  <cit> .

RESULTS
construction of twist <dig> models
according to elm, the human twist <dig> sequence deposited in ipi  displayed three regions: the n-terminal region , the bhlh domain  and the c-terminal region . the globplot <dig> program determined that the n-terminal region is highly disordered , whereas the c-terminal region was identified as a disordered region that is intercalated with α-helical structures. as a consequence, the modeling of these domains was not performed in this study. the bhlh domain was the only segment of the twist <dig> sequence that presented a hit for proteins with known 3d structures according to blastp using the brookhaven database. the identity between the twist1_bhlh and e47/neurod <dig> sequences was 47%, with an e-value of 1e- <dig> . therefore, the coordinates of the e47/neurod <dig> crystal  were chosen for modeling the bhlh domain.

there is a high degree of conservation for human r <dig> and k <dig> in the bhlh protein family, which is illustrated by the alignment between different species of twist1_bhlh sequences and the sequence of human e2a protein . both amino acids appear underlined in the consensus sequence. figure 2b illustrates the pairwise alignments between twist1_bhlh and the e <dig> and neurod <dig> monomers.

the bhlh_twist <dig> dimer model, obtained by the arrangement of two monomers, was formed by two amphipathic α-helices that were separated by a loop region. the lowest “objective function” of the modeller program was used to select the best models for the wild-type and the r118c, s144r and k145e mutant forms. the scheme of the twist <dig> dimer in the complex with dna and generated models of the homo- and heterodimers are shown in figure  <dig> . at this point, the dimer models were not generated with dna.

the structural changes promoted by the r118c, s144r and k145e mutations in the twist <dig> monomer were examined . the r118c substitution resulted in the neutralization of the net charge at this site. in addition, it is worth mentioning that both residues  differed significantly in sas, with a decrease of up to 90 Å <dig> of total surface accessible residue area . the substitution s144r also led to a modification in the aa charge , with an enhancement of the solvent accessible surface area  of the mutated amino acid . finally, the substitution k145e accounted for both homo- and heterodimer inversion of the charges . no evident difference was observed for sas, and a shift to a more hydrophilic profile was observed .

model validation
stereochemical validation of all of the models was performed with the procheck program and indicated that, after the modeller procedure minimization, they did not present aberrations. the ramachandran plot of the template structure revealed that the k <dig>  amino acid was in a disallowed position. this error was propagated to the models that used the 3d structure of the e <dig> protein as a monomer, now corresponding to the k <dig>  residue in the models. all of the structures evidenced more than 99% of the residues in the allowed region of the ramachandran plot. the modeled structures presented better values than the template structure, which presented 97% of the residues in the allowed regions . this observation likely results from the minimization energy treatment of the modeled dimers.

the bad scores are in bold, and the template scores are in bolditalic column. for the ramachandran plot, the percentages were related to the amount of residues in each area of the plot. twi – twist <dig> monomer; wt – wild-type.

according to the dfire and qmean <dig> analyses, which evaluated the model analyzing non-bonded atomic interactions and global model quality, respectively, all of the models presented score values that were higher than the template , as shown in table  <dig>  the qmean <dig> z-score values also confirmed that modeled proteins improved their three-dimensional structure, presenting values that were higher than the template . the only structure that presented a similar score to the template was the structure that corresponded to the wild-type  heterodimer , which was likely influenced by the template structure .

molecular dynamic simulations of wild-type and mutant proteins
due to protein stability, out of the 50 ns of simulation time, only the last 30 ns were subjected to complete analysis. the interaction potential energy between monomers remained constant along the simulation time for wt structures. out of all mutated dimers, the e47/twi s144r and twi_a/twi_b k145e dimers presented the lowest interaction energy level .

all of the time evolution analysis was performed using the gromacs package taking into account all of the atoms, the backbone and the cα atoms of the structures to ascertain whether there was a significant movement of the residues. once the difference between the structures with and without side-chains was within the expected range, we decided to investigate the backbone.

the root mean square deviation  and the radii of gyration  analysis of the protein, taking the equilibrated configuration  as reference, indicated that the wt dimers presented similar deviations over time. the rg analysis did not present variations that were higher than 2 Å, which indicated that there were no major deformations on the protein as a whole or on any of the domains . interestingly, the rmsd analysis indicated an average deviation of up to 6 Å for homodimers and 3 Å for heterodimers, and the mutated homodimers presented values that were higher than the wt, demanding further meticulous investigations. the solvent accessible surface area variation  was calculated by subtracting the sum of the sas of the individual monomers from the sas of their respective dimer. negative Δsasa values indicate that the association of both monomers resulted in a good mesh. the evolution of Δsasa indicated unsigned variations greater than 1700 Å <dig>  and presented a constant area during the simulation time . all of the heterodimers presented a similar Δsasa. the wt homodimer presented a lower value when compared with mutated models and exhibited a more compact conformation between monomers. the Δsasa time evolution was compatible with the energy variation, where the lowest energy corresponded to the most compacted form of the analyzed dimer , along with the formation of additional hydrogen bonds .

standard deviations are shown in parentheses. Å – angstrom ; wt – wild-type; rg – radius of gyration; rmsd – root-mean-square-deviation, taking as reference their respective starting structures. mon <dig> is monomer twi_a in the homodimer and monomer e <dig> in the heterodimer; mon <dig> is monomer twi_b in the homodimer and monomer twi in the heterodimer.

the analysis of the secondary structure of the protein bhlh dimer throughout the analysis using the dssp program did not present significant variations . therefore, all of the dimers did not exhibit large variations with respect to exposed residues and kept their structures folded.

the initial profile and behavior during the simulation of the wt and the mutated residues regarding hydrophobic/hydrophilic sasa, volume and average area were assessed . the ratio between the mean and the equilibrated structure was calculated , and the values less than  <dig>  indicated that the parameter decreased when compared with the reference. the hydrophilic sasa of c <dig> of the r118c mutant form decreased for the homo- and heterodimers and increased for r <dig> of the s144r mutant, indicating that c <dig> became less hydrophilic  and r <dig> turned into a more hydrophilic residue. the k145e mutation also changed the residue to a more hydrophilic one.

the decrease of the total sasa and average area on the c <dig> residue of 90 Å <dig> and the increase of 100 Å <dig> on the r <dig> residue were conserved throughout the simulation for both the homodimers and heterodimers. for the e <dig> mutation, the area remained constant and did not differ between the wt and the mutated residue for both dimers .

the root-mean-square-fluctuation  for each residue was calculated and plotted in figure  <dig>  the residue numbers were labeled according to their alignment . fluctuations of up to 10 Å were found at both ends of all of the monomers and in the loop region, which were completely exposed to the solvent, thus presenting higher mobility. the basic domain of the homo- and heterodimers displayed the highest fluctuation, and the mutated proteins exhibited more variations than the wt . the higher fluctuation values at the ends  were likely observed because of the absence of the remainder of the protein, which is necessary to stabilize the 3d structure. calculated b-factor parameters  also exposed this fact, and the high fluctuation of the twist <dig> monomer basic domain of the r118c heterodimer is represented with a thicker, red tube.

the basic domain presents distinct behavior compared with other domains
to perform a better analysis, the monomers were divided into four regions—basic, helix i, loop and helix ii—and the rmsd was plotted as a function of time for each region. the backbone rmsd of the basic domain for both of the dimers indicated a fluctuation of up to 4 Å, in contrast to the first helix , the loop  and the second helix  , confirming that this region presented the highest deviation from the reference equilibrated structure. despite having taken the reference structure, all of the systems that were simulated required a substantial amount of time to become organized and to become structurally stable . on the other hand, the rg for all of the atoms for the same region did not present a considerable redistribution of the atomic positions .

the minimum distance between the centers of mass for the regions presented higher values for the basic domain , confirming the previous analysis. the mutated proteins presented rmsd values that were higher than for the wt, except for the s144r homodimer, which presented values that were similar to the wt homodimer.

tracking the cavity gap motion by essential dynamic analysis
to identify the overall patterns of the motions and to visualize the high mobility of the basic domain of the twist <dig> dimers, we used principal component analysis , which relies on the hypothesis that major collective modes of fluctuation dominate the functional dynamics of a biomolecular system. pca was performed on the trajectory data using the mass-weighted covariance matrix of the atomic coordinates, where the eigenvectors give the direction of the motion and the eigenvalues account for the associated extent of the motions   <cit> . the results of the pca are presented in figure  <dig>  where the percentages of cumulative eigenvalues are plotted in a function of eigenvector index  and where the movements projected along the first eigenvector for the wt and each mutant are represented with porcupine plots . the cones point in the direction that the atoms move while the length of the cone represents the amplitude . the images  display the computation of the relative contribution to protein fluctuation for each eigenvector , and the first three eigenvectors were responsible for more than 50% of the collective motion for all dimers. the first eigenvector of the wt dimers was charged with approximately 50% of motion, while for the mutant dimers, it was accountable for 40% at most. the r118c homodimer was an exception because the first eigenvector corresponded with up to 53% of motion . this most likely occurred because the mutated residue promoted instability of the basic domain, which led to the flexibility of the protein . the four most representative collective motions  for the mutated dimers reinforce the observation that the basic domain demonstrated an aberrant motion, opening the cleft in different directions and with different amplitudes . the fluctuations of the residues belonging to the basic domain of twist <dig> monomers were highlighted by rmsd and rmsf analyses. yet, the orientation of the collective motion of the basic domain and its amplitude were better evaluated by the study of the porcupine plots.

discussion
currently, no 3d structure of twist <dig> is available. therefore, the aim of this study was to predict this structure along with important mutations in  <dig> regions by using the homology modeling technique and to study the behavior of the structures in aqueous solution. no entire 3d structure of a eukaryotic transcription factor is present in the protein data bank, which is most likely because most transcription factors with modular structures commonly possess one or more intrinsically disordered  regions/domains, usually in terminal tails and linker regions between domains  <cit> . for human twist <dig>  there is a large disordered region in the n-terminus  that is known to interact with p <dig> and hat, among other proteins  <cit> . however, this interaction has not been demonstrated in vivo yet. the disordered region contains  <dig> nuclear localization signals  <cit> . the c-terminal region of twist <dig>  which is highly conserved among vertebrates and contains a “twist-box”   <cit> , also presented a large id region that is intercalated with α-helix domains.

the bhlh domain of the twist <dig> protein is of special interest because some of the most frequent mutations described for scs occur in this domain. in addition, the domain is closely related to transcription factor function. the high sequence similarity of the bhlh domain among the various proteins of the same family and a large amount of experimental structural data allowed us to model the bhlh domain of twist <dig> and the r118c, s144r and k145e mutations in twist <dig> monomers by comparative modeling. there is a high level of conservation for human r <dig> and k <dig> across species, and the modification to a non-conserved residue could explain the loss of dna-binding capacity, which is critical to tf function. the s <dig> is less conserved among species, although it is present in more than 30% of the identified bhlh tf family members  <cit> . the choice of e <dig> as a dimerization partner was based on evidence that this partnership occurs in patients suffering the genetic disorder scs  <cit> . recent works have shown that twist <dig> transcription complexes co-precipitate with e <dig> and e <dig>  <cit> . in addition, other bhlh proteins may be twist <dig> partners, depending on the tissue and environment conditions, and will affect the expression of different targets.

all of the mutations that were described and assessed in this study modify the charge and volume of the residue side chains. the dimers also presented an accessible surface that is smaller for the wild-type proteins, demonstrating that, in mutant proteins, a higher area is exposed. the heterodimers presented better behavior in all analyzed simulation conditions. this performance is accordance with the literature, which describes heterodimers formed by e <dig> and other bhlh monomer as more stable than their respective homodimers  <cit> . the stability observed in the presence of the e <dig> monomer may be because helix  <dig> of e <dig> is one turn longer than twist <dig> , which results in an increase in the buried surface at the dimer interface. in addition, the loop region may form a network of hydrogen bonds that bridges helices  <dig> and  <dig>  stabilizing its fold, which most likely contributes to the stability of the e <dig> dimer. the e <dig> protein is stably folded and dimeric in the absence of dna binding, whereas myod, despite of its sequence similarity to e <dig>  presents a more unstable dimer  <cit> . the basic domain motion for all dimers detected in our study supports the idea that transcription factors should present an adaptable dna-binding region in a way that fits different target genes. the wider range of motion observed mainly for the r118c homodimer may be due to instability caused by this mutated residue. the other mutated dimers also presented a wider motion than the wt dimer but on a smaller scale than twi_a/twi_b r118c. our results support el ghouzzi´s suggestion of why these mutations impair twist <dig> binding to dna  <cit> . the author used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay to demonstrate the loss of binding capacity for wt and mutated dimers. the previous conclusion was made based upon the crystallographic structure of the bhlh family member myod, as the basic region of both myod and twist <dig> present high sequence identity. the modifications described by el ghouzzi were applied to myod by rotating the side-chain of the mutated residue to infer the consequences to dna-binding. it is noteworthy that this modification was performed on a static structure, without energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulation, which we have accomplished here.

CONCLUSIONS
both the twist <dig> homodimer and the e47/twist <dig> heterodimer bhlh models presented no major deformations in their structures or high amplitude movements except for the basic region. the basic region movements were accentuated in the homodimers. this behavior could be explained by the fact that this region is where the protein binds to the dna molecule; therefore, a high degree of flexibility is adequate and suitable for fitting. the dimers harboring the mutations r118c, s144r and k145e presented rmsd values that were higher than the corresponding ones for the wild-type dimers, thus verifying the observed flexibility of this domain. it was also observed that the aberrant movement may be the reason why these dimers fail to bind to target dna in a stable way. this hypothesis will be addressed by simulating these mutated dimers in complex with target dna for a longer period.
