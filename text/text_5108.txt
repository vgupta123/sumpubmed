BACKGROUND
the apetala2/ethylene response  transcription factors play a significant role in plant responses to several abiotic stresses   <cit> . accordingly, there have been many recent studies on genome-wide analysis of the ap2/erf in several plant species, including black cottonwood   <cit> , brassica oleracea  <cit> , carrot   <cit> , chinese cabbage   <cit> , eucalyptus grandis  <cit> , lotus corniculatus  <cit> , medicago truncatula  <cit> , moso bamboo   <cit> , musa species  <cit> , peach   <cit> , physic nut   <cit> , salix arbutifolia  <cit> , sweet orange   <cit> , and tea   <cit> . the cbf/dreb <dig>  genes belong to a large family of ap2/erf transcription factors and have a conserved dna binding domain that recognizes the dehydration-responsive element/c-repeat  cis-acting element in the promoters of their target genes  <cit> . studies suggest that all plant species undergo cold acclimation through a similar process that belongs, at least partially, to the cbf/dreb1-mediated cold-response pathway . this cbf/dreb <dig> pathway has been documented in arabidopsis thaliana . additionally, dreb <dig> transcription factors function in both drought- and heat-stress responses . as global warming poses abiotic stresses  to numerous plant species and threatens the world’s sustainable food production for a growing population, numerous studies have been done to evaluate the potential use of ap2/erf transcription factors to enhance plant tolerance to abiotic stresses  <cit> .

the usefulness of the cbf/dreb <dig> pathway genes to enhance freezing tolerance has been demonstrated in both herbaceous and woody plant species . however, modulating expression of the cbf/dreb <dig> pathway genes for enhancing tolerance to abiotic stress is often associated with undesirable changes in plant growth and development . for example, the constitutive expression of a peach  cbf <dig> gene  in apple rootstock resulted in both improved freezing tolerance and altered plant growth and dormancy  <cit> . in another study, transgenic grape vines over-expressing a grape  cbf  showed a slight increase in freezing tolerance in non-cold-acclimated vines and dwarf phenotypes  <cit> . similar response for cbf overexpression has been reported in a. thaliana and other species . ectopic expression of a cbf <dig> orthologue from european bilberry  enhanced freezing tolerance of a. thaliana plants and reduced rosette diameter  <cit> . collectively, beyond freezing tolerance, the over-expression of cbfs is often associated with reduced plant growth  and altered developmental processes such as flowering time, leaf senescence, and plant longevity  . the occurrence of these additional phenotypic changes is due to the complexity of the cbfs-mediated low-temperature regulatory networks and these changes are sometimes considered desirable for crop/fruit production  <cit> . of the major cbf/dreb <dig> transcription factors, the dre1e_arath  and dre1f_arath  have not been studied in crops . arabidopsis thaliana plants overexpressing the ddf <dig> showed dark-green leaves, dwarfism, and late flowering; concurrently, the plants displayed enhanced tolerance to cold, drought, heat and high salinity  <cit> .

overexpression of cbf <dig> in a. thaliana is mainly associated with delayed leaf senescence and extended plant longevity; additionally, overexpression of muscadinia rotundifolia cbf <dig> gene in muscadinia rotundifolia resulted in growth retardation, dwarfism, late flowering, and abiotic stress tolerance  <cit> . in this study, we showed a blueberry-derived cbf , which was initially considered to be an orthologue of cbf <dig> that promoted freezing tolerance in a. thaliana  <cit> , was more similar to a. thaliana ddf <dig>  overexpression of the bb-cbf  enhanced cold tolerance in leaves and dormant buds but not in flower tissues of a southern highbush blueberry cultivar  <cit> . regardless of whether bb-cbf is a ddf <dig> or cbf <dig> orthologue, further studies are needed to facilitate a better understanding of the cbf/dreb1-mediate gene networks in blueberry. unlike a. thaliana, few studies have been conducted to investigate the overall impact of the overexpression of a cbf/dreb <dig> pathway gene on transcriptomic changes in woody plant species.

comparative transcriptome analysis is a powerful tool used to identify differential gene expression caused by overexpression of a transgene  <cit> . for example, overexpression of blueberry flowering locus t  in blueberry plants resulted in plant dwarfing and early flowering  <cit> . transcriptome analysis of these transgenic plants revealed differentially expressed  genes in flowering and phytohormone pathway genes that are involved in the phenotypic changes driven by vcft-overexpression  <cit> . the aim of this study is to elucidate transcriptomic responses to the overexpression of vcddf <dig>  and predict overall performance of vcddf1-ox transgenic blueberry plants. the analysis of de genes focused on the pathways related to plant growth, flowering or freezing tolerance in blueberry such as plant flowering, cbf-mediated cold/freezing tolerance, phytohormones and della proteins  <cit> .

RESULTS
vcddf <dig> and vcddf1-ox in blueberry
the vcddf <dig> was initially designated as bb-cbf  due to its similarity to a. thaliana cbf <dig>  and this reasoning is valid when ddf <dig> is not included in phylogenetic analysis  <cit> . however, in our recent transcriptome analysis of highbush blueberry using trinity and trinotate  <cit> , the bb-cbf was annotated as dre1e_arath . our designation of bb-cbf as vcddf <dig> is the result of the phylogenetic analysis of a. thaliana cbf/dreb <dig>  and the blueberry-derived dre1e_arath, dre1a_arath, dre1b_arath, and dre1f_orysj, which showed that bb-cbf is  <dig> % similar to ddf <dig> compared  <dig> % to cbf <dig> . the cbf <dig> orthologues in blueberry were then assigned to the other two gene contigs . it is interesting to note that vcddf <dig> orthologues in many other woody plants are often annotated as dreb <dig> due to the conserved erf/ap <dig> dna-binding domains .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of cbf/dreb <dig> proteins of blueberry and multiple protein sequence alignment of ddf <dig> and vcddf <dig> orthologues. a phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences of cbf/dreb <dig> proteins of blueberry and a. thaliana using neighbor joining in mega  <dig> . the bootstrap values were obtained from  <dig> replicates. the tree was drawn to scale, with branch length equal to substitutions per nucleotide. the black square shows the transgene vcddf <dig> and c62996-g1-i <dig> is another endogenous vcddf <dig>

to investigate the effect of vcddf1-ox at transcript levels in non-acclimated floral buds, comparative transcriptome analysis was conducted in non-transgenic ‘legacy’ plants and plants of a representative transgenic event ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ with a single copy of transgenes . the ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ showed a 145-fold increase in the expression of the vcddf <dig> in comparison to the non-transgenic ‘legacy’ plants. the high vcddf <dig> expression supported our previous observation that the ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ transgenic event showed high freezing tolerance in electrolyte leakage assays  <cit> .

effect of the vcddf1-ox on plant freezing tolerance
constitutive expression of vcddf <dig> resulted in increased freezing tolerance in detached tissues of a. thaliana and blueberry plants  <cit> . in this study, the vcddf1-ox enhanced freezing tolerance in intact plants. the freezing tolerance in  four-year plants, one of non-transgenic ‘legacy’, two of ‘legacy- pcambia’ events, and  <dig> of ‘legacy-vcddf1’ transgenic events, was investigated. the ‘legacy-vcddf1’ transgenic plants showed a significantly higher survival rate  than those of the non-transgenic ‘legacy’ and transgenic ‘legacy-pcambia’ controls .fig.  <dig> freezing tolerance in transgenic blueberry plants overexpressing a vcddf <dig>  a the survival rates of 3-year old blueberry plants of non-transgenic ‘legacy’ , transgenic ‘legacy-pcambia’ containing a control plasmid pcambia <dig> , and  <dig> transgenic ‘legacy-vcddf1’ events  after the exposure to unprotected environmental conditions in the winters of  <dig> and  <dig>  the representative transgenic event ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ is included in the  <dig> events. b under unprotected environmental conditions, one 4-year old ‘legacy’ plant died and one ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ plant survived




in the winter of  <dig>  we also investigated the freezing tolerance of  <dig> three-year plants for both the non-transgenic ‘legacy’ and the ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ transgenic event. the ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ transgenic plants exhibited a higher plant survival rate  than the non-transgenic plants  . applying a freezing shock of −12 °c for 15 min resulted in visual differences between transgenic ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ and non-transgenic ‘legacy’ plants during the plant recovery process. for non-transgenic plant, all leaves and over 90% of the buds showed dying symptoms and died in three weeks. in contrast, for transgenic plants, about 70% of the leaves had no survival leaf tissues, in three weeks; additionally, about 25% buds died. overall, vcddf1-ox enhanced freezing tolerance of the intact ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ plants .

effect of the vcddf1-ox on plant growth and flowering
the vcddf1-ox did not alter the growth of transgenic blueberry plants. when four-year transgenic plants of  <dig> independent ‘legacy-vcddf1’ events, including the representative transgenic event ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’, were compared with those of non-transgenic ‘legacy’ and transgenic control ‘legacy-pcambia’ plants, all plants looked similar in plant stature and appearance  and did not show any difference  in plant height, the number of canes, or the number of flower buds . these results suggest that vcddf1-ox has little phenotypic effect on blueberry plant growth and floral bud formation. therefore, vcddf <dig> do not share the designated role of ddf <dig> in inducing growth retardation and dwarfism.fig.  <dig> effect of overexpression of vcddf <dig> on blueberry plant growth and development. a growth of 4-year old plants of ‘legacy’ and ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ . b average plant height and number of canes of 4-year old plants. legacy: non-transgenic southern highbush cultivar ‘legacy’, three plants. vcddf1: transgenic ‘legacy’ containing the vcddf <dig>  three plants for each of the  <dig> independent transgenic events. vcddf1-ox: one representative transgenic legacy-vcddf <dig> event, three plants. c average number of floral bud for 1- to 3-year old plants including  <dig> plants for each of ‘legacy’ and ‘vcddf1-ox’. d flowering of four-year old plants  after receiving different amount of chilling. cu: chilling unit




in relation to both non-transgenic ‘legacy’ plants and transgenic control ‘legacy-pcambia’, delayed flowering was not found in any ‘legacy-vcddf1’ plants. for example, ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ and non-transgenic ‘legacy’ plants did not show significant differences in the number of floral buds, the age of plant flowering, and the yearly flowering time. moreover, vcddf1-ox did not affect the chilling requirement of ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ plants . taken together, vcddf1-ox is not associated with significant changes in plant growth and flowering of tetraploid blueberry plants unlike overexpression of ddf <dig> in a. thaliana  <cit> .

profile of differentially expressed  genes induced by the vcddf1-ox
to reveal the potential roles of the vcddf <dig> at gene transcription levels, comparative transcriptome analysis was conducted between the ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ and non-transgenic ‘legacy’ plants. the vcddf1-ox in non-acclimated floral buds of the ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ plants resulted in  <dig> de genes and  <dig> de transcripts, of which  <dig> de genes were annotated. these de genes were classified in  <dig> over-represented gene ontology  terms  in the analysis using the goslim_plant as the selected go file and a. thaliana annotation as a reference . of the  <dig> over-represented go terms in biological_process, two highly over-represented go terms  revealed the potential function of the vcddf1-ox in affecting plant freezing tolerance as well as other abiotic stresses. additionally, two other highly over-represented go terms  suggested that vcddf1-ox could affect plant growth and flower development . the vcddf1-ox functions at cellular levels  and intracellular  levels through its catalytic activity , dna binding , transcription factor activity , and transcription regulator activity  . overall, the results suggest that vcddf <dig> is a functional dreb <dig> transcription factor and the vcddf1-ox has an impact on gene expression of multiple pathways in blueberry.fig.  <dig> gene networks of differentially expressed genes in dormant bud tissues of ‘legacy-ddf1-ox’ plants. the ontology file of goslim_plants in bingo was used to identify overrepresented go terms . bubble size and color indicates the frequency of go term and p-value, respectively. red arrows show examples of go terms related to abiotic resistance, plant growth, and flowering , the major effect of vcddf1-ox in molecular function , and cellular component 




the responses of blueberry cor genes to the vcddf1-ox
we used  <dig> a. thaliana cor genes to search for blueberry cor  genes in our blueberry transcriptome reference reftrinity , which is developed using the rna sequencing data of leaf, flower, and dormant bud tissues  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  transcripts of  <dig>  vccor genes showed similarities  to  <dig> a. thaliana cor genes. and  <dig> transcript contigs of  <dig> vccor genes are the ortholouges of a. thaliana cbf1/dreb1b, cbf2/dreb1c, cbf3/dreb1a, cbf4/dreb1d, or ddf <dig> .

in the dormant buds of ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ plants,  <dig>  de transcripts of  <dig> vccor genes showed high similarities  to  <dig> cor genes of a. thaliana . of these de vccor genes, the up-regulated vcddf <dig> and down-regulated vccbf <dig> are the de cbf/dreb <dig> genes of blueberry. these results suggest vcddf1-ox regulated some vccor genes, which contributed to increase freezing tolerance in intact plants of the ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ .

the responses of blueberry floral genes to the vcddf1-ox
whereas overexpression of ddf <dig> resulted in delaying a. thaliana plant flowering  <cit> , vcddf1-ox did not result in visible changes in flowering of tetraploid blueberry plants . to investigate the potential impact of vcddf1-ox on blueberry flowering, we searched for de floral genes in the dormant buds of ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ using the floral gene list of blueberry  <cit> . twenty-one floral genes derived from  <dig> transcripts of  <dig> gene contigs showed differential expression, of which seven floral genes were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated . this suggests vcddf1-ox affects flowering pathway genes. however, none of the  <dig> de floral genes showed changes above four folds. the expression of blueberry suppressor of overexpression of constans  <dig>  was reduced to  <dig> % and the expression of blueberry constans-like  <dig> -like gene was repressed to  <dig> % as much as non-transgenic ‘legacy’ plants. this down-regulated expression of vcsoc <dig> and vccol <dig> is theoretically associated with delayed flowering  <cit> . however, the blueberry short vegetative phase  showed a decreased expression, which in contrast theoretically promotes plant flowering. in spite of these de floral genes, the vcddf1-ox was insufficient to promote significant changes in floral bud formation, chilling requirement and flowering time of the ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ plants .table  <dig> de floral genes in dormant bud tissues of ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ plants

the responses of major phytohormone genes to the vcddf1-ox
the vcddf1-ox did not lead to dwarf ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ plants , which is inconsistent with the designated function of ddf <dig> overexpression in causing dwarf a. thaliana plants  <cit> . to evaluate the potential effect of the vcddf1-ox on plant growth, we identified the de pathway genes of five major phytohormones  in dormant buds of ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ plants. except for the aba pathway, de transcript contigs were found for all other pathways, including  <dig> for iaa,  <dig> for ga, five for cytokinin, and  <dig> for ethylene . the ga pathway has six and eight transcript contigs shared with those in the iaa and ethylene pathways, respectively, indicating the interaction of these pathway genes . in the ethylene pathway,  <dig> out of  <dig> de transcripts showed a less than 4-fold change; and only one de transcript contig of an orthologue of ethylene-insensitive <dig>  was up-regulated to approximately ten fold. these de phytohormone genes did not alter plant growth of the ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ plants .fig.  <dig> differentially expressed genes  in dormant bud tissues of ‘legacy-ddf1-ox’ plants. a major phytohormone gene contigs, i.e., gibberellin , abscisic acid , arr related genes of cytokinin, and indole acetic acid . b qrt-pcr analysis of representative transcripts. eukaryotic translation initiation factor  <dig> subunit h is the internal control. relative expression  in legacy-vcddf1-ox was calculated by 2-∆∆ct, ∆∆ct = legacy-vcddf1-ox – legacy. average fold-changes ± standard error of three biological replicates for each of ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ and ‘legacy’ plants were plotted. significant average fold-change determined using a student’s t-test is denoted. an asterisk  indicates p <  <dig> ; double asterisks  indicate p <  <dig> ; and triple asterisks  indicate p <  <dig> 




the responses of della proteins to the vcddf1-ox
we found  <dig> transcript contigs of  <dig> gene contigs in the blueberry transcriptome reference reftrinity that show high similarities  to the five della protein genes of a. thaliana. of the  <dig> transcript contigs, two de transcript contigs of two genes are the rgl <dig> orthologues in the bud tissues of the ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ plants. one of them was repressed to  <dig> % and another one was up-regulated to  <dig> % . vcddf1-ox poses little effect on the expression of della protein genes in blueberry plants. this provides additional evidence to show the insignificant effect of vcddf1-ox on blueberry plant growth and flowering .

confirmation of the expression of the selected de transcripts
we designed six pairs of qrt-pcr primers, consisting of two pairs for ga and iaa pathways and one pair for each of cytokinin and ethylene pathways, to validate the de transcripts of four phytohormone pathways. these selected de transcripts  often play important roles in their pathways. of the six de transcripts tested, qrt-pcr results and rna-seq data of five transcripts correlated very well ; only one de transcript revealed by rna-seq did not show significant difference  in qrt-pcr analysis  but it showed an increase in a regular rt-pcr analysis . these results suggest that our rna-seq data analysis appears reliable for identification of de genes.

discussion
plant freezing tolerance depends on many factors, such as natural environment, plant species/genotypes, plant developmental stages, acclimation state, organs, and tissues  <cit> . for woody fruit crops, global warming poses concerns for its impact on the phenology of plant dormancy and freezing tolerance. to address these concerns, a thorough understanding of the genetics and mechanisms of plant freezing tolerance and dormancy is needed. with highbush blueberries, freezing injuries in winter and early spring are major concerns.

the cbf/dreb <dig> orthologues in blueberry
in woody fruit crops, constitutive expression of cbf <dig> and cbf <dig> or their orthologues has resulted in similar phenotypic changes to those observed in a. thaliana, suggesting that cbf/dreb <dig> mediated-freezing tolerance is conserved in plants  <cit> . in this study, our phylogenetic analysis of blueberry cbf/dreb <dig> proteins suggest the previous bb-cbf  is more likely to be a ddf <dig> orthologue  . the orthologues of this vcddf <dig> are in many deciduous woody plants but none of them was annotated as a cbf <dig> orthologue in genbank . it is also interesting that we do not see cbf <dig> orthologues in our transcriptome reference. the low coverage of our transcriptome reference may have contributed to the lack of cbf <dig> orthologues but the lack of orthologues is probably due to the genome specificity of blueberry plants.

regardless of distinction between cbf <dig> orthologue  or ddf <dig> orthologue , constitutive expression of this gene is anticipated for dwarfism and late flowering of transgenic plants if its designated function is conserved  <cit> . however, this is not the phenotypic change observed in transgenic arabidopsis and blueberry plants, where the vcddf1-ox enhanced plant freezing tolerance   <cit> . these results suggest the function of dreb <dig> orthologues in different plant species may vary from their functions designated in arabidopsis .fig.  <dig> schematic diagram illustrating the effect of overexpressing a blueberry ddf <dig> orthologue on plant freezing tolerance. the diagram illustrating the effect of overexpression of cbf/dreb <dig> on freezing tolerance, plant growth and development in a. thaliana was derived from previous reports  <cit> . the overexpression of vcddf <dig> showed little effect on della protein genes but could affect plant tolerance to drought and high salinity through altered gene expression in auxin and cytokinin pathways




effect of the vcddf1-ox on plant flowering
in a. thaliana, the delayed flowering caused by overexpression of cbf <dig> , <dig> was due to the increased expression of flowering locus c  and repressed expression of soc <dig>  <cit> . in this study, vcddf1-ox repressed the expression of vcsoc <dig>  which is similar to the previous report  <cit> . however, none of the orthologues of flc in blueberry, including the mads-affecting flowering 2-like gene , mads-affecting flowering 5-like gene , and vernalization1-like gene , showed differential expression. in addition, the expression of vcsvp, an orthologue of a. thaliana svp that acts as a negative regulator of a. thaliana plant flowering  <cit> , was repressed. these differences between the response of the flowering pathway genes to the vcddf1-ox in blueberry and those of the overexpression of cbf <dig> , <dig> in a. thaliana are responsible for the unchanged flowering phenotype caused by vcddf1-ox.

effect of the vcddf1-ox on della protein genes
in a. thaliana the delayed flowering and growth retardation caused by the overexpression of cbf <dig> , <dig> are due to the changes of della proteins  <cit> . the dwarf a. thaliana plants caused by overexpression of ddf <dig> was because of reducing bioactive gibberellin  <cit> . in this study, vcddf1-ox induced little change to the expression of della protein genes, providing further molecular evidence to support that normal growth and flowering of ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ plants,

effect of the vcddf1-ox on phytohormone genes
in a. thaliana, the cold-response of cbf <dig>  cbf <dig>  and cbf <dig> is aba independent while the response of cbf <dig> is aba dependent  <cit> . additionally, ethylene signaling can affect expression of cbfs  <cit> , and della proteins responding to the overexpression of cbf/dreb <dig> genes are ga-related  <cit> . it seems that cbf/dreb <dig> genes interact with phytohormone genes to affect plant growth and development. in this study, vcddf1-ox in tetraploid blueberry plants affected gene expression of the synthesis pathways of iaa, cytokinin, ga, and ethylene but not aba . the  <dig> de transcript contigs of  <dig> gene contigs in the ethylene pathway could contribute to the increased freezing tolerance  <cit> . the  <dig> de transcript contigs of  <dig> gene in the ga pathway did not show any changes over 4-folds and may have affected the minor changes in the two de genes of della proteins. eleven de transcript contigs of nine genes are orthologues of two iaa pathway genes of a. thaliana, including cyp83b <dig> and auxin transporter protein  <dig> ; both genes are key regulators of root growth and development  <cit> . the orthologues of two cytokinin pathway genes a. thaliana b-type response regulator <dig>  and a. thaliana pseudo-response regulator  <dig>  include five de transcript contigs, the up-regulated arr <dig> orthologue could promote root elongation  <cit> . the de transcripts involved in auxin and cytokinin pathways have likely altered plant tolerance to drought or high salinity pending on further investigations  <cit> . the analysis of de transcripts of phytohormone genes in addition to della protein genes provide molecular evidence to support that vcddf1-ox was not associated with dwarf and delayed flowering in tetraploid blueberry plants.

effect of the vcddf1-ox on freezing tolerance
in terms of its role in freezing tolerance, vcddf <dig> has the same function as ddf <dig> and other cbf/dreb <dig> genes in a. thaliana  <cit> . based on both our previous electrolyte leakage assay of in vitro tissues  <cit>  and freezing tolerance assay of intact plants in this study, we have demonstrated that vcddf1-ox is able to enhance freezing tolerance in blueberry plants. in addition, the comparison of vccor genes in ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ plants with non-transgenic ‘legacy’ has provided molecular evidence to support the role of overexpressed vcddf <dig> in enhanced freezing tolerance . of the de orthologues of cbf/dreb <dig> genes, vcddf1-ox down-regulated vccbf <dig>  which did not alter plant growth and flowering.

CONCLUSIONS
in tetraploid blueberry plants, vcddf1-ox resulted in enhanced freezing tolerance and normal plant growth and flowering compared to non-transgenic plants. the increased freezing tolerance is attributed to de vccor genes, which are similar to the ddf <dig> and the other cbf/dreb <dig> genes . in contrast to dwarf plant and delayed flowering associated with overexpression of ddf <dig> or other cbf/dreb <dig>  <cit> , normal phenotypes with regards to plant growth and flowering was due to minimal effect of overexpressed vcddf <dig> on the expression of della proteins, flowering pathway genes, and other phytohormone genes related to plant growth . the de genes in phytohormone pathways of auxin and cytokinin imply that vcddf1-ox might enhance plant tolerance to drought and high salinity.

this is the first known investigation of a ddf <dig> orthologue in any crop. more importantly, this is the first time the overexpression of a cbf/dreb <dig> orthologue was found to enhance plant freezing tolerance without altering plant growth and flowering time. this finding opens a new approach to increase freezing tolerance of deciduous woody plants by using overexpression of vcddf <dig> or its orthologues.
