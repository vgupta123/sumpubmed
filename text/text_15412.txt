BACKGROUND
copepods represent the largest biomass of all animals on earth . they are aquatic animals, primarily marine, and make up the dominant zooplankton assemblages in nearshore environments  <cit> . in spite of their critical ecological roles, the taxonomic classification has received poor attention. copepods exhibit extreme morphological diversity and occupy an enormous range of habitats in the aquatic realm, from freshwater to hypersaline, shallow pool, and cave to deep sea environments . humes  <cit>  described that there are  <dig>  species  and estimated that a hypothetical total of  <dig>  species may exist on the planet  <cit> . copepods are also particularly notorious for cryptic speciation .

traditionally, there are ten orders of the subclass copepoda milne-edwards,  <dig> containing a large different number of families, genera, and species  <cit> . the morphological phylogenetic analyses of copepoda have been extensively investigated and there are general agreements such as the monophyletic status of copepoda . furthermore, copepods can be divided into two infraclasses, progymnoplea and neocopepoda  <cit> . progymnoplea contains only one order  and neocopepoda can be further classified into two superorders, gymnoplea and podoplea  <cit> . for several decades, however, the phylogenetic relationships among the copepod orders have been a matter of controversy . due to an extreme diversity of body forms, the phylogenetic relationships based on traditional morphological data have led to much controversy . for example, ho  <cit>  and huys and boxshall  <cit>  analyzed  <dig> and  <dig> morphological characters across ten copepod orders  <cit> . they agreed that platycopioida and calanoida were the most basal groups . however, the cladogram from ho  <cit>  depicted harpacticoida and gelyelloida were closely related, but this group was a distinct cluster to the group of siphonostomatoida, while that of huys and boxshall  <cit>  appeared that harpacticoida had a close affinity to a sister-group of siphonostomatoida but a discrete to gelyelloida. later, some modifications for the morphological phylogenetic models have been proposed  <cit> . however, as ho et al.  <cit>  pointed out, the inconsistent position of harpacticoida that represents an important ecological group in aquatic environments has been still problematical  <cit> .fig.  <dig> major phylogenetic hypotheses based on morphological characters of copepod orders, redrawn from a) ho  <cit> , b) huys and boxshall  <cit> , c) ho  <cit> , and d) ho et al.  <cit> . cyan and yellow boxes indicate the superorders, podoplea and gymnoplea  <cit> . after huys and boxshall  <cit> , platycopioida is classified as a newly proposed infraclass, progymnoplea. a new order, thaumatopsylloida  is proposed by ho et al.  <cit> . poecilostomatoida and monstrilloida  are considered as the subgroup of cyclopoida and siphonostomatoida, respectively  <cit> . grey dotted lines depict the ambiguous phylogenetic relationships from ho et al.  <cit> . four copepod orders  are examined in this study




furthermore, some molecular-based studies were not congruent with morphological evidence . braga et al.  <cit>  focused on the phylogenetic relationships within the copepod family euchaetidae and also showed the three copepod orders  using the large subunit ribosomal rna  gene   <cit> . the tree appeared to be markedly inconsistent with morphological phylogenies; harpacticoida was closer to calanoida than to poecilostomatoida, which was in conflict to the superorder podoplea . later, other molecular studies recovered and supported the monophyletic podoplean group using the 18s small subunit ribosomal rna gene , but still unresolved the phylogenetic position of harpacticoida  . recent study using concatenated twelve mitochondrial genes showed that harpacticoida  was more closely related to siphonostomatoida  than calanoida    <cit> . this mitochondrial phylogenetic hypothesis was generally congruent with the majority of the morphological phylogenies  <cit>  except for the phylogenetic position of poecilostomatoida . moreover, in the 18s rrna gene trees of poecilostomatoida, the clausidiiform complex and the remaining poecilostomatoid taxa appeared to be paraphyletic   <cit> . harpacticoida also may be a paraphyletic taxon with polyarthra  and oligoarthra   <cit> . from the 28s rrna gene tree , two polyarthra taxa  were more closely related to other copepods than to oligoarthra   <cit> . all these molecular phylogenetic studies used a relatively short length of the sequences  or fast evolving genes that were not acceptable for interordinal relationships .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic hypotheses based on molecular sequence data of copepod orders, redrawn from a) braga et al.  <cit> , b) huys et al.  <cit> , c) huys et al.  <cit> , d) minxiao et al.  <cit> , e) tung et al.  <cit> , and f) schizas et al.  <cit> . phylogenetic trees using a) the large subunit ribosomal rna  gene   <cit> , b) the small subunit ribosomal rna  gene   <cit> , c) 18s rrna   <cit> , d) the concatenated twelve mitochondrial genes  <cit> , e) 18s rrna  <cit> , and f) 28s rrna   <cit> . poecilostomatoida and monstrilloida  are considered as the subgroup of cyclopoida and siphonostomatoida, respectively  <cit> . in this study, four copepod orders  are examined. cyan and yellow boxes indicate podoplea and gymnoplea, respectively. grey dotted lines indicate the low bootstrap values 




the purpose of the present study was therefore to clarify the phylogenetic relationships among four major orders of copepods using phylogenomics, the inference of phylogenetic relationships using genome-scale data which has increasingly become a powerful tool to resolve difficult phylogenetic questions . in particular, the aim was to include the following: 1) an extensive analysis of the phylogenetic position of harpacticoida and to evaluate all possible phylogenetic hypotheses; 2) the phylogenetic relationships of copepods among other crustacean groups; and 3) the divergence times of the major copepod orders. accordingly, the orthologous sequences of  <dig> nuclear protein-coding genes were retrieved from  <dig> arthropod species representing four copepod orders , five other crustaceans , two insects, and two closely related outgroups . this study was the first report that provides a rich taxon sampling with genomics-based evidence focusing on the evolution of copepods and their divergence time. thus, for an ecological perspective, understanding the phylogenetic relationships of copepods would have provided a first step toward elucidating an ecological interaction, habitat colonization, and speciation in copepoda.

methods
taxonomic sampling and identification of orthologous genes
the genome and transcriptome assemblies for  <dig> arthropod species were obtained from multiple sources . for eight copepod species, five transcriptome  and three genome sequences  were downloaded from the national center for biotechnology information  sequence read archive  database   <cit> . three additional crustacean species were also included: the giant tiger prawn penaeus monodon , the purple barnacle amphibalanus amphitrite , and the brine shrimp artemia franciscana  from ncbi sra. three other crustacean genome sequences  were downloaded from baylor college of medicine human genome sequencing center , as a part of the pilot project for the i5k arthropod genomes project  <cit> . among these crustacean species examined, none of the orthologous sequences for the  <dig> nuclear protein-coding sequences  was identified in calanus finmarchicus which was excluded from further analysis. also, the orthologous sequences were further retrieved from the non-redundant  protein database at ncbi . all orthologous sequences from the copepod acanthocyclops vernalis were obtained from ncbi nr database. all orthologous sequences identified in this study and the genbank accession numbers were summarized in additional file 1: table s <dig>  in addition to the crustacean species mentioned above, five publicly released genomes were added in this study. these sequences of the water flea daphnia pulex , the fruit fly , the red flour beetle , the centipede strigamia maritima , and blacklegged tick ixodes scapularis  were downloaded from the wfleabase , flybase , beetlebase , bcm-hgsc , and vectorbase , respectively .

the previously reported nuclear protein-coding genes that were used for the phylogenetic analysis were retrieved as search queries. these sequences were obtained from regier et al.  <cit>  and wiegmann et al.  <cit> . the orthologous genes were defined by the basic local alignment search tool  programs  <cit> . the e-value threshold of 1 × 10− <dig> with the database size  <dig>  ×  <dig> was used to identify orthologous candidates against the genome and transcriptome assemblies. the putative orthologous genes were verified by searches using tblastn against ncbi nr database. after partial sequences or no apparent orthologs were excluded from the analysis,  <dig> nuclear protein-coding genes were then determined in more than half of the copepod species . all identified copepod protein and nucleotide sequences are provided in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> 

multiple sequence alignments
multiple alignments of each of the protein gene families were generated using mafft   <cit>  with the l-ins-i algorithm  which uses a consistency-based objective function and local pairwise alignment with affine gap costs. alignments were adjusted manually when necessary. poorly aligned regions with more than 70% of gaps were removed using trimal   <cit> . the corresponding coding nucleotide alignments were generated using pal2nal  <cit> . the single gene sequence alignments are available in: http://bioinformatics.unl.edu/eyun/copepoda_phylogenomics. all sequences were concatenated using a custom perl script . this perl script is available upon request from the author. the concatenated dataset used in this study is available in additional file  <dig> 

phylogenetic analysis and alternative topology tests
phylogenetic relationship using the concatenated sequences was reconstructed by the maximum-likelihood  method with the le and gascuel  matrix, gamma distributed rates, invariant sites, and the observed amino acid frequencies using phyml  . the best-fit model for the concatenated dataset was selected using the akaike information criterion  as a statistical tool in prottest   <cit> . non-parametric bootstrapping with  <dig> pseudo-replicates was used to estimate the confidence of branching patterns for the ml phylogeny  <cit> . bayesian inferences  of phylogeny were performed using mrbayes   <cit>  with the lg substitution model, gamma-distributed rate variation, and invariant sites. the markov chain monte carlo search was run for 5 ×  <dig> generations, with a sampling frequency of  <dig>  using three heated and one cold chain and with a burn-in of  <dig> trees.

the phylogenetic trees were also reconstructed using the “degen-1” coding sequences, in which nucleotides at any codon position that have the potential of synonymous substitutions were degenerated  <cit> . to produce the degenerated synonymous matrices   <cit> , the perl script  written by andreas zwick and april hussey was used . for the morphological reanalysis, the data matrix of  <dig> morphological characters was obtained from ho et al.  <cit> . this morphological data matrix in nexus format is available in additional file  <dig>  phylogenetic inference of the morphological data was conducted with mrbayes   <cit> , using the mk  model  <cit> , a variable rate among characters , and 5 ×  <dig> generations. the mk model assumes equal state frequencies. in this analysis, trees were sampled every  <dig> generations with the first 25% discarded as burn-in and summarized using a 50% majority rule consensus tree. presentation of the phylogenies was done with figtree  .

the kishino-hasegawa   <cit> , the shimodaira-hasegawa   <cit> , and the approximately unbiased   <cit>  tests were used to statistically assess the phylogenetic hypotheses. the site log-likelihood of each tree was calculated in tree-puzzle   <cit> , and kh, sh, and au tests were performed in consel  with default options  <cit> .

divergence time estimation
the divergence times of lineages were estimated using beast <dig>   <cit>  with bayesian inference using the calibrated yule model for the tree prior and the uncorrelated relaxed clock model proposed by drummond et al.  <cit> . beast <dig> was using a random tree with 5 ×  <dig> generations and a sample frequency of 5 ×  <dig> generations. four fossil-based minimum ages were applied for the major splits;  <dig> mya for the diptera-cladocera divergence,  <dig> mya for the cladocera-anostraca divergence,  <dig>  mya for the diptera-coleoptera divergence, and  <dig>  mya for the amphipoda-decapoda divergence  <cit> . the fossil record of wujicaris muelleri zhang et al.  <cit>  was also used as the minimum constraint on the crown group of pancrustacea .

RESULTS
monophyly of copepods and their interordinal relationships
 <dig> nuclear protein-coding genes were obtained from  <dig> arthropod species including nine copepod species  . the common names of species examined with the current taxonomic classification were listed in table  <dig>  among  <dig> arthropods, two non-pancrustacean taxa, the centipede strigamia maritima and blacklegged tick ixodes scapularis, were used as the outgroups  <cit> . all  <dig> nuclear protein-coding sequences were concatenated for further phylogenetic analyses . the data set of the concatenated sequences consisted of  <dig>  amino acid sequences . the phylogenetic relationships obtained from the concatenated sequences were reconstructed by the maximum-likelihood  and bayesian inferences . the two algorithms confirmed the monophyly of copepods with 100% bootstrap values . the nine copepod species examined can be classified into two superorders, gymnoplea  and podoplea  . the phylogenomic analyses with ml and bi generated the same topologies supporting the monophyly of the podoplean group. the superorder podoplea was strongly supported with the high maximum likelihood bootstrap value  and bayesian posterior probability  .table  <dig> taxonomic classification used in this study

most notably, within podoplea, the interordinal relationships inferred from the phylogenomic analysis differed from that of the widely accepted hypothesis presented in the majority of the morphological and molecular phylogenetic studies that harpacticoida was generally affiliated with siphonostomatoida rather than with cyclopoida  <cit>  . in addition to order level relationships in this study, all family and genus level relationships were also clearly resolved by high bootstrap values  . this study included three families for calanoida: , calanidae) and three genera in cyclopoida: , lernaea).

phylogenetic position of harpacticoida
to confirm the phylogenetic position of harpacticoida , four different phylogenetic analyses were attempted; 1) bayesian reestimation of morphological characters, 2) the “degen-1” coding sequences of regier et al.  <cit> , 3) small-scale phylogeny dealing with only nine copepod species with two closely related outgroups, and 4) statistical analyses were performed for all possible trees . first, the morphological phylogeny was reconstructed by bayesian inferences . bayesian analysis using  <dig> morphological characters showed the same topology with that of ho et al.  <cit>  which was reconstructed by maximum parsimony. this tree yielded mostly congruent results with the majority of the copepod phylogeny above. however, all posterior probabilities with the morphology-only data set showed a general lack  of support except for three nodes . this suggested that these morphological data might not have sufficient phylogenetic signal. for the second and third attempts, the phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the “degen-1” coding sequences and from only nine copepod species with amphibalanus amphitrite  and penaeus monodon  as the outgroups. both the phylogenetic approaches returned the same topology as that obtained from fig.  <dig> . the phylogenetic relationships were less resolved  using the “degen-1” nucleotide dataset than that of fig.  <dig>  but better resolved in the small-scale phylogeny by high bootstrap values  . lastly, to evaluate those previously proposed hypotheses shown in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  statistical analyses were performed using tree-puzzle  and consel   <cit>  . in table  <dig>  the first hypothesis, as mentioned earlier, was obtained from the majority of the copepod phylogeny. the second hypothesis was the best maximum likelihood tree obtained from the concatenated phyml tree in this study. the third hypothesis was a theoretical tree, in which harpacticoida was closely related to cyclopoida. all statistical tests rejected the third hypothesis. although the kh test  and the sh test  were unable to reject the first hypothesis, the au topology test was marginally rejected  at the  <dig>  level of significance. this was most likely due to the conservative nature of the kh test and the sh test. the kh test was invalid in this case because the second hypothetical tree was the best ml tree  <cit> . the sh test is the most conservative estimate and is sensitive to the unlikely tree   <cit> . among the three tests, the au test is known as the best approach to overcome these problems  <cit> . thus, the results of the statistical test supported that the most likely phylogenetic scenario is the second hypothesis. taken together, these results strongly suggested that siphonostomatoida was closer to cyclopoida than harpacticoida.table  <dig> statistical comparisons between the best ml tree and alternative phylogenetic hypotheses within podopean copepods

copepoda is a sister group to communostraca
according to the present phylogenomic analysis, the resulting trees revealed that copepoda was a sister lineage to a group of thecostraca and malacostraca but distinct to branchiopoda , consistent with results from regier et al.  <cit>  and oakley et al.  <cit> . both ml and bi inferred the following interclass relationships: , )). the purple barnacle a. amphitrite  was considered to be a sister group to copepods, namely maxillopoda. in this study, however, this species appeared to be a sister group to the group  of h. azteca  and p. monodon , but distinctly related to copepods . the mlb and bpp values for the clade of sessilia, amphipoda, and decapoda were highly supported  . therefore, this study supported the newly proposed clade, communostraca  that includes malacostraca  and thecostraca  and the newly proposed clade, multicrustacea  with high support values   <cit>  .

this study also supported a proposed clade of insecta and branchiopoda, consistent with results from oakley et al.  <cit>  representing the allotriocarida  clade  <cit> . a very recent study also supported the monophyly of allotriocarida  <cit> . branchiopoda  was considered to belong to the subphylum crustacea. however, this group was more closely related to insecta but distinct to all other crustaceans examined in this study. although the mlb value for the clade of allotriocarida  was not very strong , this hypothesis is often congruent with those obtained from recent studies  <cit> . therefore, the phylogenetic trees in this study supported the hypotheses of the three newly proposed clades, communostraca, multicrustacea, and allotriocarida, but challenged the validity of hexanauplia and vericrustacea .

estimation of divergence time in copepoda
divergence times were estimated using beast <dig>   <cit>  with bayesian inference. the tree topology was the same as the phyml tree shown in fig.  <dig>  divergence between the groups of podopleans and gymnopleans was estimated to have occurred during the period from the late cambrian to the devonian . the origin of t. californicus appeared to have occurred in the devonian  . the divergence time between the two orders siphonostomatoida and cyclopoida occurred in the carboniferous  which predated approximately the origin of harpacticoida . seven extant families in this analysis arose before the cenozoic era and possibly prior to the early stage of breakup of gondwana  <cit> .fig.  <dig> estimated divergence times among copepods. beast <dig>   <cit>  is used with five calibration points . orange bars across nodes indicate 95% highest posterior density  of the bayesian posterior distribution of molecular time estimates. the open and closed red circles  above the branches show the oldest fossil records, most likely corresponding to the copepod orders . the geologic time scale is according to the international chronostratigraphic chart 




discussion
the present study provides the first phylogenomic evidence to support the monophyletic origin of four major orders of copepods and the group of podopleans. the monophyletic status of copepoda has been broadly accepted by both morphological  <cit>  and large-scale phylogenomic analyses . although this study does not include all copepod orders, there can be no doubt of the monophyly of copepods. the subclass copepoda consists of two infraclasses, progymnoplea and neocopepoda, suggested by huys and boxshall  <cit> . the infraclass neocopepoda can be further divided into two superorder groups, gymnoplea and podoplea . the concept of this classification was proposed by giesbrecht  <cit>  and became generally accepted  <cit> . however, the naupliar musculature and the molecular phylogeny using partial nuclear 28s rrna gene   showed conflicting results and suggested a possible paraphyletic origin of podopleans  <cit> . later, morphological  <cit>  and molecular  <cit>  phylogenetic analyses recovered the monophyly of podopleans. in this study, the phylogenomic analysis shows that three podoplean copepod orders are clearly clustered as a monophyletic clade  .

unexpectedly, the current phylogenomic evidence is in conflict to the majority of the copepod phylogenies . the present schematic phylogeny resemble those found in the earlier phylogenies and postembryonic data  <cit>  which show that calanoida represents the most basal split among the four copepod orders and that harpacticoida is the basally-branching group of podoplea. on the basis on postembryonic apomorphies, naupliar characters can be represented by plesiomorphic states because postembryonic stages  provide a valuable resource for evolutionary history  <cit> . his study implied that harpacticoida is the more basally-branching group than misophrioida within podopleans, which is hardly reported in previous studies . interestingly, our preliminary survey based on weighted morphological characters after removing the convergent characters appears that harpacticoida is the most basally-branching podoplean group . for example, some morphological characters support the current phylogenomic phylogeny; following the characters from huys and boxshall  <cit> , character  <dig> , character  <dig> , and character  <dig> . these morphological characters can be the candidates to investigate the order-level relationships of copepods and morphological transitions . based on character  <dig> which is absent of in harpacticoida but is present in misophrioida and many other podopleans, harpacticoida seems to be the most basally-branching group within podoplea. furthermore, as keenly pointed out by ho  <cit> , some characters such as character  <dig> , character  <dig> , and character  <dig>  are confirmed as convergent characters in this study. these implies that differential weighting criteria for the morphological phylogeny  <cit>  and the removal of convergent characters can reduce the phylogenetic noise. in fact, from the preliminary survey removing the convergent characters, the posterior probabilities in bayesian phylogenetic inference are increased .

recent studies have given rise to a new taxonomic classification of copepoda. although many progresses have been made toward unraveling the phylogeny and taxonomy of copepoda, there is so far no consensus of their order-level classification. this should be due to their extreme morphological diversity and a lack of genetic information. huys and boxshall  <cit>  summarized ten copepod orders  <cit> . ho et al.  <cit>  proposed a new order, thaumatopsylloida because the family thaumatopsyllidae was a distinct group from the order cyclopoida and differed from monstrilloida and siphonostomatoida  <cit> . boxshall and halsey  <cit>  suggested that poecilostomatoida was merged into cyclopoida  <cit> . huys et al.  <cit> , minxiao et al.  <cit> , and huys et al.  <cit>  supported this view  using 18s rrna and the concatenated twelve mitochondrial genes  <cit> . another molecular sequence study using 18s rrna  suggested that the order monstrilloida  was nested within a fish-parasitic clade of the order siphonostomatoida and thus was considered as the subgroup of siphonostomatoida  <cit> . the 18s rrna gene and 28s rrna gene trees showed that poecilostomatoida and harpacticoida were paraphyletic, respectively   <cit> .

some studies have argued that adding more sequences is more important than adding taxa for improved phylogenetic accuracy  <cit>  . indeed, in copepods, insufficient and only partial sequences have been used and showed a limitation for certain order-level  <cit> . blanco-bercial et al.  <cit>  discussed that the use of a single gene at the family or superfamily level of copepods contributed to the disparate results, and the relationships in the superfamily centropagoidea  were still unresolved using the four concatenated genes   <cit> . therefore, the phylogenomic approach will make notable contributions to a better resolution of copepod evolution and then can be anchored to certain taxonomic clades. furthermore, the resulting phylogenomic tree can provide an independent test of morphological character homology and can help to determine the assumptions of plesiomorphic or apomorphic characters and the convergent or homoplastic characters, which are considered as the most difficult issue for copepod taxonomy  <cit> .

the class maxillopoda  is one of the most diverse groups of crustaceans including copepods, barnacles, and a number of related animals   <cit> . however, the monophyly of maxillopoda seemed increasingly doubtful and the maxillopodan concept became obsolete due to the phylogenetic studies of the arthropoda . these studies appear in the polyphyly of maxillopoda. in addition, the phylogenetic position of copepods in relationship to other crustacean groups has been controversial, resulting a particularly ambiguous resolution of copepoda, thecostraca, malacostraca, and branchiopoda. therefore, the phylogenetic relationships among crustaceans are still far from being resolved  <cit> . recent phylogenomic studies advocate a new taxonomic nomenclature for the crustacean groups. regier et al.  <cit>  and oakley et al.  <cit>  proposed several crustacean classifications; communostraca , multicrustacea , and vericrustacea   <cit>  and allotriocarida  and hexanauplia   <cit> . from the currently inferred phylogenies including six crustacean groups , the tree supports well the hypothesis of the three newly proposed clades, communostraca, multicrustacea, and allotriocarida. however, this study challenges the validity of hexanauplia and vericrustacea, corroborating those obtained from other phylogenomic analyses   <cit> .

this study confirms that the rapidly evolving genes tend to generate the phylogenetic noise  <cit>  and that the slower evolving genes contain more informative positions  <cit> . for instance, the phylogenies using a single gene tree from 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, carbamoylphosphate synthetase, and alanyl-trna synthetase show the non-monophyly of copepoda . this may be due to incomplete sequences of genes which are not identified to cover the intact region in this study but also to a relatively high level of sequence variation. regier et al.  <cit>  also categorizes these genes as the fast evolving genes   <cit> . therefore, the phylogenetic signals from the fast evolving genes could generate misleading effects in evolutionary studies  <cit> . note that, however, the copepod topology after excluding these genes is same as the one shown above .

divergence between the groups of podopleans and gymnopleans is estimated to have occurred in the very late ordovician. this implies that the origin of copepods may be earlier  than this period  <cit> . it is because all copepod taxa in this study belong to the infraclass neocopepoda, and platycopioida  is known to be the most primitive group of copepods and possibly closer to the ancestral form  <cit> . only few fossil records of copepods are available because of their fragile nature and thus having a very low level of potential fossilization. divergence time estimations in this study are in good agreement with these known fossil records . recently, a new fossil of freshwater harpacticoids  has been found in carboniferous bitumen, dating back to at least  <dig> mya  <cit> . interestingly, the origin of t. californicus assumed in this study is almost congruent with this fossil record . the family canthocamptidae is the largest group  of harpacticoids and predominately inhabit fresh water  <cit> . boxshall and jaume  <cit>  speculated that harpacticoids invaded fresh waters on pangaea based on the pattern of colonization of continental waters. this study supports this hypothesis by molecular sequence analysis. to study the adaptation on the different types of environments  and the timing of colonization events, a strong phylogenetic hypothesis must be established. for the future, comparative genomics of copepod species will help us understanding their evolutionary history and shed light on a wide range of ecological adaptations.

CONCLUSIONS
a series of molecular phylogenetic analyses of nine copepod species with five other crustacean groups, two hexapods, and two outgroups  is presented using the  <dig> orthologous nuclear protein-coding genes. given the phylogeny, this hypothesis provides an overview of the useful directions for future studies and thus will shed a light into new taxonomic investigations. as more sequences become available in the near future, further studies with more comprehensive taxa are essential to evaluate the various hypotheses as well as fully resolve the evolutionary history and taxonomy of copepoda. also, some copepod orders  need to be refined by further phylogenomic studies. the large scale of molecular data such as genomes and transcriptomes of copepods provides us a valuable resource for understanding copepod evolution and a wide range of ecological adaptations.
