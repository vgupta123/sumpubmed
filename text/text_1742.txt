BACKGROUND
mouse submandibular gland  development is initiated with a thickening of the oral epithelium of the mandibular arch around embryonic day  <dig>   and is best conceptualized in stages <cit> . in the prebud stage, smg development begins as thickening of the oral epithelium adjacent to the tongue. during the initial bud stage, this thickening grows down into mandibular arch mesenchyme to form the initial smg bud. with continued epithelial proliferation and downgrowth, the smg primordium becomes a solid, elongated epithelial stalk terminating in a bulb. repeated end-bud branching results in the formation of a network of epithelial branches and terminal buds . these epithelial branches and terminal buds hollow out by cell apoptosis during the canalicular and terminal bud stages, respectively, to form the ductal system and presumptive acini, with mucin protein being produced by the presumptive acini.

morphogenesis of complex organs such as the smg is regulated by the functional integration of parallel and broadly related signaling pathways which regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis and histodifferentiation  <cit> . to understand the complex interactions within this dynamic signaling network, one must first determine the contribution of individual pathways and identify those which play essential, nonredundant roles during embryonic smg initial bud formation, branching morphogenesis and histodifferentiation.

the fgf family, with at least  <dig> members, mediates diverse biological functions such as cell proliferation, branching morphogenesis and histodifferentiation by binding and activating four tyrosine kinase receptors  . tissue-specific alternate splicing of the fgfr <dig>  fgfr <dig> and fgfr <dig> genes generates isoforms which differentially bind specific fgf ligands  <cit> . ligand-receptor binding potentially activates multiple intracellular cascades, including the erk/ras/mapk, p13k, and plc-γ/pkc pathways .

functional studies have demonstrated that embryonic smg epithelial cell proliferation, branching morphogenesis, and histodifferentation are regulated through growth factor, cytokine, and transcription factor-mediated signaling pathways, including egf, tgf-β, shh, fgfs, and eda  <cit> . although fgfs have been implicated in embryonic smg development  <cit> , a more complete understanding of their precise roles will provide insight into the complex network of parallel and broadly-related signaling pathways which regulate smg organogenesis.

gene targeting studies have clearly shown the importance of the fgfr2b  signaling pathway for embryonic morphogenesis  <cit> . fgfr2b-/- null mice die at birth due to lung insufficiency and exhibit severe dysmorphic organs, including agenesis or dysplasia of the lungs, mammary glands, pancreas, thyroid, teeth, and limbs  <cit> . although fgf <dig>  fgf <dig>  fgf <dig>  and fgf <dig> bind with high affinity to fgfr2b  <cit> , the phenotypic similarities between fgf <dig> and fgfr2b null mice  <cit>  indicate that fgf <dig> is the major ligand for fgfr2b in vivo. of particular interest is the absence of smgs in e <dig>  and older fgfr2b null mice and newborn fgf <dig> null mice  <cit> . however, whether this glandular absence is due to the lack of development of a smg initial bud  or subsequent aplasia of the initial bud was heretofore unknown.

recently, entesarian et al.  <cit>  have shown the importance of fgf <dig> gene dosage for salivary gland development in humans. individuals with autosomal dominant alsg  exhibit hypoplastic or absent parotid and submandibular glands. alsg was mapped to 5p <dig> -5q <dig>  to include the fgf <dig> gene; heterozygous fgf <dig> mutations were identified in all family members with alsg. complementary study of adult fgf10+/- mutant mice revealed that fgf <dig> heterozygotes have absent parotid glands and smaller smgs although other organs such as lungs, liver, spleen, pancreas, thyroid, limbs appeared normal.

taken together, the literature suggests that fgf10/fgfr2b signaling plays an essential, nonredundant, dose-dependent role during embryonic smg development. to address this postulate, we evaluated smg development in fgfr2b and fgf <dig> heterozygous mutant and null mice and demonstrate dose-dependent differences in smg phenotypes. in a complementary set of in vitro experiments, we confirm the importance of fgf10/fgfr2b signaling and demonstrate that enhanced fgf10/fgfr2b signaling significantly induces, and abrogated fgf10/fgfrb signaling significantly diminishes, smg branching morphogenesis and cell proliferation.

our previous analyses of mutant mice and functional in vitro studies indicate that the fgf8/fgfr2c signaling pathway is essential for embryonic smg epithelial branching morphogenesis and histodifferentiation  <cit> . little is known about the functional relationship between the fgf10/fgfr2b and fgf8/fgfr2c pathways during smg development. thus, we evaluated the smg phenotype in fgfr2c+/Δ/fgf10+/- double heterozygous mice, compared them to fgf10+/-  and fgfr2c+/Δ  single heterozygous mutant, as well as wildtype , littermates and demonstrate genotype-specific smg phenotypes. though we were able to rescue the abnormal phenotype associated with reduced in vitro fgf10/fgfr2b signaling with exogenous fgf <dig> peptide supplementation, our results indicate that the fgf10/fgfr2b and fgf8/fgfr2c are nonredundant signaling pathways essential for in vivo embryonic smg development.

RESULTS
to delineate the role of fgf10/fgfr2b signaling during embryonic smg development, we evaluated the smg phenotype in fgf <dig> and fgfr2b null and heterozygous mutant mice. the e <dig>  normal smg appears as an elongated solid cord of epithelium terminating in an end-bulb  . by contrast, the e <dig>  fgfr2b null smg is severely hypoplastic , displaying an extremely small initial bud similar to the earliest initial bud stage  <cit> . a similar phenotype is seen in fgf <dig> null mice . normally by e <dig> , epithelial proliferation results in smg primordia with end-bulbs characterized by several branches; smgs from both fgfr2b and fgf <dig> null mice are entirely absent . on the other hand, fgfr2b+/- and fgf10+/- heterozygosity results in smg branching hypoplasia compared to wt glands, with fewer ducts and terminal buds being seen in heterozygous mutant smgs than in wt smg . taken together, our data indicate that fgf10/fgfr2b signaling plays an essential, dose-dependent role during in vivo embryonic smg branching morphogenesis and histodifferentation, but not earliest initial bud formation. thus, the pathology in null mice is aplasia, not agenesis.

enhanced fgf10/fgfr2b signaling in vitro induces embryonic smg branching morphogenesis and epithelial cell proliferation
to further delineate the role of fgf10/fgfr2b signaling during embryonic smg development, we used our well-defined organ culture system to analyze the effect of enhanced fgf10/fgfr2b signaling on embryonic smg branching morphogenesis. paired e <dig>  or e <dig>  smg primordia were cultured for up to  <dig> days in the presence or absence of fgf <dig> peptide . since a notable difference in smg branch number is usually seen among littermates, we compared the number of terminal buds in right and left glands  from each embryo. spooner ratios  were determined for each explant, the data were then arcsin transformed, and the mean ratios compared by paired t-test. fgf <dig> supplementation induced a significant increase in branching morphogenesis : 81% for e <dig> +  <dig>  and 46% for e <dig> +  <dig> .

since cell proliferation is not required for early embryonic smg epithelial branching  <cit> , we determined if this fgf10-induced increase in branching is due to increased epithelial cell proliferation. we cultured e13+ <dig> smg primordia in the presence or absence of  <dig> ng/ml fgf <dig> peptide and calculated the epithelial cell proliferation index . exogenous fgf <dig> induced a significant 78%  increase in epithelial cell proliferation compared to control . our results are similar to enhanced pancreatic epithelial cell proliferation and pancreatic hyperplasia in transgenic mice with persistent fgf <dig> expression in developing pancreatic epithelia  <cit> .

abrogated fgf10/fgfr2b signaling in vitro decreases embryonic smg branching morphogenesis and cell proliferation
we interrupted fgf10/fgfr2b signaling in vitro by adding exogenous soluble fgfr2b-fc chimera to the culture medium to competitively bind endogenous fgfr2b ligands. this exogenous receptor/ligand binding methodology has been successfully used to interrupt fgfr2b, fgfr2c, fgfr1b and fgfr1c signaling in vitro  <cit> . this experiment was designed to provide an in vitro model of the in vivo fgf10+/- heterozygous mutant smg phenotype . we conducted dose-response studies and determined the concentration of fgfr2b-fc chimera which induces a clear biologic effect of reduced branching morphogenesis, thereby creating an in vitro model of the in vivo fgf <dig> mutant heterozygote. paired e13+ <dig> or e14+ <dig> smg primordia were cultured in igg-fc  or fgfr2b-fc chimera  and spooner ratios were determined as described above. e <dig> +  <dig> fgfr2b-fc-treated explants exhibit a significant 22%  decrease in branching morphogenesis compared to controls ; a similar 22% reduction  was also seen in e14+2-treated explants . these results mimic the in vivo heterozygous mutants reported above.

since exogenous fgf <dig> supplementation in vitro induced a significant increase in cell proliferation, we then evaluated the epithelial cell proliferation index in e <dig> + <dig> smg primordia with or without abrogated fgf10/fgfr2b signaling. a significant 32%  decrease in cell proliferation was seen in the presence of  <dig> ng/ml fgfr2b-fc chimera compared to control . reduction in cell proliferation with fgfr2b-fc treatment in vitro was also reported by steinberg et al.,  <cit> . these results indicate that fgf10/fgfr2b signaling modulates embryonic smg epithelial cell proliferation and branching morphogenesis.

relationship between fgfr2b and fgfr2c signaling pathways during smg development
our previous observation of hypoplastic smgs in fgfr2c+/Δ deficient mice suggested that fgfr2c signaling is necessary for embryonic smg branching morphogenesis and histodifferentation  <cit> . the functional importance of this signaling pathway was confirmed in vitro; reduction of fgfr2c signaling in vitro resulted in a significant dose-dependent decrease in branching morphogenesis  <cit> . in addition, fgf <dig>  a major fgfr2c ligand, has been shown to play an essential, nonredundant role during embryonic smg development  <cit> . like the hypoplastic smg phenotype of fgfr2c deficient mice, hypoplastic glands are seen in fgf <dig> hypomorphic mice  <cit> . importantly, smg aplasia is seen in fgf <dig> tissue-specific conditional mutant mice. to investigate the relationship between the fgfr2b and fgfr2c signal transduction pathways during in vivo smg development, we evaluated the smg phenotype in mice which are heterozygous for both the fgf <dig> and fgfr2c genes . mutant mice heterozygous for either fgfr2c  or fgf <dig>  exhibit hypoplastic smgs compared to wt  littermates . in contrast, fgfr2c+/Δ/fgf10+/- double heterozygous mutant smgs are smaller and exhibit fewer ducts and terminal buds than seen in single heterozygous fgfr2c+/Δ/fgf10+/+ or fgfr2c+/+/fgf10+/- mutant glands . these results suggest that, during embryonic smg development, the fgfr2b and fgfr2c signal transduction pathways each induce at least some downstream targets that are idiosyncratic and not coincident.

fgf <dig> rescues smgs with interrupted fgf10/fgfr2b in vitro
given that fgf8-mediated signaling plays an essential and unique role during smg development  <cit> , as well as our observation in fgfr2c+/Δ/fgf10+/- double heterozygous mutant mice discussed above, we postulated that exogenous fgf <dig> peptide would rescue the abnormal smg phenotype associated with abrogated fgfr2b signaling in vitro. to determine if exogenous fgf <dig> peptide supplementation could restore branching morphogenesis to normal, we interrupted smg morphogenesis in vitro with fgfr2b-fc chimera and attempted to "rescue" these explants and restore branching to the level seen in controls. we cultured paired e <dig> +  <dig> smgs in  <dig> ng/ml fgfr2b-fc chimera for an initial period of  <dig> hours and then in fgfr2b-fc +  <dig> ng/ml fgf <dig> peptide or fgfr2b-fc alone for a total of  <dig> days . a second experiment to confirm that exogenous fgfr2b-fc chimera decreased smg branching morphogenesis consisted of paired e <dig> +  <dig> cultured in the presence of  <dig> ng/ml fgfr2b-fc or igg-fc. in this set of experiments, fgfr2b-fc-treated explants exhibit a significant 20%  decrease in branching compared to igg-fc controls . addition of exogenous fgf <dig> peptide induced a significant 24%  increase in branching compared to fgfr2b-fc treatment alone, thus completely restoring branching morphogenesis to the level seen in controls .

discussion
the fgf family of growth factors is critical to normal embryogenesis, regulating cell proliferation, survival and apoptosis  <cit> . analyses of fgfr2b and fgf <dig> mutant and null mice clearly demonstrate that the fgf10/fgfr2b signal transduction pathway is essential for the development of branching organs, including the lung, mammary gland, lacrimal gland, pancreas, thyroid gland and salivary gland  <cit> . although smgs were absent from e <dig>  or older fgfr2b null mice and newborn fgf <dig> null mice  <cit> , the presence of an initial smg bud in e <dig>  fgf <dig> and fgfr2b null embryos  indicates that this is a true aplasia, and not agenesis. moreover, the absence of smgs in e <dig>  and older fgfr2b-/- and fgf10-/- mutants confirms that fgf10/fgfr2b signaling is essential for earliest initial epithelial branching and subsequent pseudoglandular stage and older smg morphogenesis, but not earliest initial bud formation.

the observed initial smg bud formation and subsequent aplasia is consistent with the pathogenesis seen in other organs, including the fgfr2b null mammary gland  <cit> , but differs from that seen in lung and pancreas  <cit> . interestingly, bellusci and colleagues  <cit>  also detected genotype-specific phenotypic differences in mammary bud formation. a transient single initial mammary gland bud  seen in e <dig>  fgfr2b-/- mice is absent in e <dig>  mice whereas bud  <dig> is maintained  in fgf10-/- mice. this result suggests that fgfr2b signaling is essential to maintain bud  <dig> and to induce the other mammary placodes whereas another fgfr2b ligand  acts redundantly with fgf <dig> to maintain the mammary gland placode. similarly, differences in pancreatic development were observed between fgf <dig> and fgfr2b null mice  <cit> . taken together, these results clearly indicate that fgfr2b and fgf <dig> null mice demonstrate tissue-specific differences in affected organs.

although fgf10+/- heterozygous mice were described as being normal  <cit> , lacrimal, parotid and submandibular gland aplasia or hypoplasia were recently reported in adult fgf10+/- mice and in alsg patients with fgf <dig> heterozygous mutations  <cit> . to determine if fgfr2b and fgf <dig> gene dosage plays an important role during embryonic smg development, we evaluated newborn fgfr2b+/- and fgf10+/- and found smg hypoplasia in both . this is the first report of organ abnormality in fgfr2b heterozygous mice. our data indicate that smg development is fgf <dig> and fgfr2b dose-dependent. homozygous null mutants exhibit smg aplasia while heterozygotes exhibit smg hypoplasia. moreover, the observations of normal lungs, livers, and limbs  <cit> , but abnormal smg phenotypes  <cit> , in fgfr2b+/- and fgf10+/- mutant mice provides additional evidence of fgf10/fgfr2b tissue-specificity.

relationship between fgf10/fgfr2b and fgf8/fgfr2c signaling pathways
it is critical to remember that fgf <dig> binding to fgfr2b is part of a much larger genetic network. organogenesis is the programmed expression of regulatory genes coupled to downstream structural genes and epigenetic events. specific signaling pathways are parallel and largely functionally redundant; that is, several pathways differentially and combinatorially compensate for the dysfunction of a given individual pathway. there are some pathways, however, that have unique and nonredundant functions. one has always to ask two key questions: is our pathway of interest functionally redundant or nonredundant? will a broadly related, not independent, pathway compensate for the dysfunction of our pathway of interest?

the observation of smg aplasia in fgf <dig> and fgfr2b null mice indicates that the functional presence of other endogenous fgf/fgfr pathways  or other signaling pathways  could not prevent complete death of embryonic smg cells in fgf10-/- and fgfr2b-/- mice. interestingly, although smg aplasia was also seen in fgf <dig>  conditional mutant mice in which fgf <dig> expression was ablated from first branchial arch epithelium, a small initial smg bud is still seen in e <dig>  embryos  <cit> . by contrast, the fgf10and fgfr2b null smg bud is much more transient, being seen in e <dig>  and absent in e <dig>  mice . this suggests that the fgf10/fgfr2b and fgf8/fgfr2c signaling pathways are both essential for branching and that the fgf10/fgfr2b signal is necessary for epithelial bud maintenance at earlier stages than the fgf8/fgfr2c signal.

the absence of smgs in both fgf8c/n; ap2αirescre/+ conditional mutant  <cit>  and fgf10-/- null mice  suggests that fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> probably induce some of the same downstream targets, although through different receptors . however, the mere fact of ontogenic arrest and smg aplasia, as well as temporal differences, in fgf <dig> conditional mutants and fgf <dig> and fgfr2b null mice indicate that fgf10/fgfr2b and fgf8/fgfr2c signaling pathways induce broadly-related, but unique and nonredundant downstream cascades in smgs that cannot be compensated by normal function of the other under physiologic conditions. our observation of smaller and more severely hypoplastic smgs in fgfr2c+/Δ/fgf10+/- double heterozygous mice compared to either the fgfr2c+/Δ or fgf10+/- single heterozygous mutants further supports this conclusion.

it is well established that fgf/fgfr signaling can simultaneously activate multiple signaling cascades , as well as fgf <dig> heterozygous mutant individuals with alsg syndrome  <cit> .

fgf <dig>  or fgfr2b  loss of function is ultimately epistatic to each other and to the epigenome under normal physiologic conditions , the very reason they are critical to smg morphogenesis. however, since the epistasis associated with declining fgf <dig> or fgfr2b function is a nonlinear emergent property of the complete functional epigenotype, it can be manipulated in vitro in the manner reported here. exogenous fgf <dig> peptide can completely rescue and restore to normal the abnormal phenotype seen with abrogated fgf10/fgfr <dig> signaling in vitro . this is not surprising since fgf <dig> has the ability to simultaneously activate similar, as well as unique and ligand-specific, intracellular cascades which control proliferation, survival, and differentiation. rescue experiments have always to be only a proof of this principle, not a mimic of the in vivo condition. after all, fgf10-/- and fgfr2b-/- mutant smgs are not rescued in vivo, the very essence of epistatic mutations. what remains to be determined is the in vivo functional relationship between the fgf10/fgfr2b signal transduction pathway and other key downstream signaling pathways, and how these pathways are integrated during embryonic smg development to compose the functional epigenome.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that fgf10/fgfr2b signaling is essential for the smg epithelial branching and histodifferentiation, but not earliest initial bud formation. the functional presence of other endogenous fgf pathways or other signaling pathways could not prevent complete death of embryonic smg cells in fgf <dig> and fgfr2b null mice. moreover, our analysis of fgfr2c+/Δ/fgf10+/- double heterozygous mice indicates that fgf10/fgfr2b and fgf8/fgfr2c signaling pathways induce broadly-related, but unique and nonredundant downstream cascades in smgs. what remains to be determined is the in vivo functional relationship between the fgf10/fgfr2b signal transduction pathway and other key downstream signaling pathways, and how these pathways are integrated during embryonic smg development to compose the functional epigenome.
