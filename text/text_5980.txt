BACKGROUND
sugarcane  is a large, perennial, tropical or subtropical crop. it is one of the world’s most produced crops  contributing about 80% of the world sugar production . sugarcane also plays an increasingly important role in the biofuel field accounting for 40% of ethanol production worldwide  <cit> . sugarcane mature stalks contain about  <dig> to 18% sucrose  <cit> . the genus saccharum includes two wild species, s. spontaneum and s. robustum, and one cultivar species s. officinarum; these three species are thought to be the founding species. majority of both s. robustum and s. officinarum are octoploid, with a basic chromosome number x =  <dig>  whereas s. spontaneum’s chromosome number ranges from 2n =  <dig> to  <dig> with the majority of basic chromosome number x =  <dig> . s. officinarum is a high-glucose species with, and is thought to be derived from s. robustum as these two species have the same center of diversity in new guinea  <cit> . modern sugarcane cultivars are hybrids derived from the cross between s. officinarum and s. spontaneum, resulting in extreme allopolyploidy levels that can range from octoploidy  to dodecaploidy . most of the basic molecular and genetic analyses remain inconclusive in sugarcane due to the lack of genomic information of this complex genome. typically, expressed sequence tags  resources are used for sugarcane gene and gene family discovery, and these were the sole resource prior to the release of sorghum genome  <cit> . sorghum is the closest diploid species of saccharum, and has a genome size about 760 mb which has been sequenced  <cit> . comparative genomic studies demonstrated that sorghum has a small, diploid genome that contains fewer chromosomal rearrangements and shares a strong collinearity with sugarcane, thus providing the best reference model system to study sugarcane genomics . it is possible to identify sugarcane genes by combining the bac sequences and the available sorghum genome data.

the study of sugar metabolism in sugarcane is one of the most active areas of research. in plants, sucrose is cleaved into udg-glucose and fructose by sucrose synthase , or can be cleaved into glucose and fructose by invertases for further sugar metabolism  <cit> . fructokinases  can phosphorylate free fructose with high substrate specificity and affinity  <cit> . hence, the phosphorylation of fructose by frks is believed to be necessary for sucrose cleavage and sugar metabolism, both of which are essential for proper development of vascular tissue  <cit> . to date, plant frks have been purified from several plants, such as arabidopsis  <cit> , sugar beet  <cit> , potato  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , rice  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , maize  <cit> , pea seeds  <cit> . two isoforms of sugarcane fructokinases, frk <dig> and frk <dig> were purified from the culm of sugarcane  <cit> . nevertheless, due to the complex sugarcane genetic background, identification of sugarcane frk genes is still unavailable.

understanding the molecular structure and evolution of a gene family is a key step towards the understanding of the physiological roles, metabolic mechanism and potential function of its members, the necessary groundwork for possible future transgenic studies. in this study, to characterize the gene evolution and possible functions of the frk gene family in sugarcane, we performed gene family identification based on the combination of comparative genomics strategies and high genome coverage of bacterial artificial chromosomes  library resources, and investigated gene expression levels by rna-seq and rt-qpcr. the analysis of this study mainly focuses on 1) the evolutionary relationship and gene structure of the frk gene families, and 2) characterization of the gene expression patterns of the frk gene family to predict function.

RESULTS
identification of seven frk genes in s. spontaneum
based on comparative genomics, seven well annotated sorghum frk genes, referred to as sbfrks, were identified . these seven sbfrks were located in chr <dig>  chr <dig>  chr <dig>  chr <dig> and chr <dig> of sorghum genome. none of these seven was observed to have undergone tandem duplication. using these well-annotated sbfrk genes as references to design probes ,  <dig> bac sequences for frks were screened and sequenced from s. spontaneum. further analysis revealed that the 12 s. spontaneum sequences encoded seven frks referred to as ssfrk1-ssfrk <dig>  in these  <dig> sequences, ssfrk <dig> had three allelic haplotypes, ssfrk <dig>  ssfrk <dig>  and ssfrk <dig> had two allelic haplotypes, ssfrk <dig>  ssfrk <dig> and ssfrk <dig> only had one allele. the allelic haplotypes of each frk are indicated by an additional “-h1” to “-h3” at the end of gene name. using the gene model sequences of the annotated frk genes as queries, an in-house est and genbank database were extensively searched. the results showed that six of the ssfrks had the corresponding ests in the genbank database except ssfrk <dig> .table  <dig> information of putative frk genes in sorghum

the coding sequences of frks were translated into protein sequences. the alignment of ssfrks revealed that ssfrks harbors two conserved domains, pfkb <dig> -g-x--x-n-{agls}--x-{a}-x-{g}-{gnka}--x-g;and pfkb2:--x---d-x---- , demonstrating that these sequences belong to frk family members. the molecular weights of the ssfrks ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda, and three frks  had a larger size than the others . comparative analysis between sorghum and s. spontanenum were performed to investigate the divergence of ssfrks/sbfrks. the results showed that the ssfrks have molecular weights that are similar to their orthologous frk in sorghum, except for frk <dig> and frk <dig>  consistently, ssfrks shared high identities  with their orthologous sbfrks, well above those of frk <dig>  and frk <dig> . these results indicated that frk <dig> and frk <dig> had undergone stronger evolutionary dynamics after the split of saccharum and sorghum.fig.  <dig> conserved domains of the ssfrks gene family. two conserved domains, pfkb <dig> and pfkb <dig>  of frks were identified using blastp  and interpro  with protein sequences

to analyze the divergence among the paralogous frks in s. spontaneum, an intercomparison of protein sequences among ssfrks was performed . results showed that ssfrks shared protein sequence similarities ranging between  <dig> and 64%. among the ssfrks, ssfrk <dig> and ssfrk <dig> displayed the highest similarity, 64%, whereas the other pairwise similarities were under 40%, and most of the  <dig> of the analyzed gene pairs were excluded from the comparison results due to the high sequence divergence among the gene families, suggesting that the ssfrk is an ancient gene family with potentially high functional divergence.

comparative analysis of ssfrk allelic haplotypes
of the four ssfrks with allelic haplotype sequences, three ssfrks  shared very high similarity with identity higher than 99%, and ssfrk <dig> was less constraint within its alleles of  <dig> % for genomic sequences and  <dig> % for protein sequences. similarly, gene structure comparisons within the allelic haplotype of the four genes also demonstrated that the allelic haplotype of three ssfrks  were highly conserved, while ssfrk <dig> alleles had a deletion/insertion for their first intron . protein sequence alignment of the allelic haplotypes showed that ssfrk <dig>  ssfrk <dig>  ssfrk <dig> and ssfrk <dig> had  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> variant amino acids, respectively . ssfrk <dig> presented great variation at the n terminal . however, none of these variable amino acids located to the two pfrk domains, indicating functional conservation among these allelic haplotypes.fig.  <dig> comparison of the allelic gene structure of ssfrks. the allelic haplotypes of each frk was indicated additional “-h1” to “-h3” at the end of gene name. boxes represent exons

the evolutionary function constraint in ssfrk families
the evolutionary function constraint was evaluated for allelic haplotypes based on nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution ratio  . the results revealed that ssfrk <dig>  ssfrk <dig> and ssfrk <dig> were under strong purifying selection as the ka/ks ratio was lower than  <dig> , while frk <dig> was approximately under neutral selection  with a ka/ks ratio of  <dig> . in addition, the ka/ks ratio of pairwise of s.spontaneum - sorghum showed that ssfrk <dig>  ssfrk <dig>  and ssfrk <dig> have a larger value above  <dig> . these results showed that different ssfrks had undergone different evolutionary forces.fig.  <dig> the ka/ks of ssfrk haplotypes and ssfrk-sbfrk. the lower value of ka/ks is indicated by stars. the blue color indicates the ka/ks of gene pair allele comparisons, orange color indicates the ka/ks of orthologs genes between sorghum and s. spontaneum





phylogenetic analysis of ssfrks and other plant frks
to analyze the phylogenetics of the frk gene family,  <dig> frks were selected from eight representative plant species including four monocotyledons , and four dicotyledons  and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the clustalx with neighbor-joining method . the frks were phylogenetically distributed into six groups, referred to as group i - group vi. each of the groups contained frk genes from both monocotyledons and dicotyledons, suggesting that the six gene groups originated before the monocot-dicot split. in group v, the dicot and monocot genes were separated into two subgroups, indicating that the genes in this group diverged from an evolutionary event after the common ancestor of dicots and monocots. group i is the largest group, counting  <dig> frks including ssfrk <dig> and ssfrk <dig>  in this group, genes were distributed into two subgroups, each of which could be further divides into two subgroups with one consisting of monocot specific genes, and the other containing both dicot and monocot genes, suggesting that gene expansion occurred in dicot species before the divergence of dicots and monocots. group ii contained  <dig> frks including ssfrk <dig> and ssfrk <dig> from seven plant species except grape. group iii consists of  <dig> frks from  <dig> of the  <dig> plant species , and it is likely that gene loss is a recent event  that occurred in both of dicot and monocot plants. both group iv and vi contain  <dig> frks with one from each the eight plant species, revealing that the genes in two groups shared an ancient ancestor before the divergence of dicots and monocots. group v contained  <dig> frks from  <dig> of the  <dig> plant species , suggesting that a recent frk gene loss event occurred after the split of potato and tomato in solanum.fig.  <dig> comparison of gene structure and phylogenetic analysis of the eight members of ssfrk gene family. unrooted phylogenetic tree of plant frk proteins constructed using the neighbour-joining method with mega  <dig> . <dig> program. grmzm2g: zea mays, sb: sorghum bicolor, loc_os: oryza sativa, ssfek: saccharum spp, at: arabidopsis thaliana, gsvivt: vitis vinifera, solyc: solanum lycopersicum, pgsc: solanum tuberosum. frk gene families are also shown for comparison. boxes represent exons, triangles represent transposons. the star signs indicates potential gene duplication events for the ssfrk families




the frks of chlamydomonas and yeast were used as the out group for the phylogenetic analysis of the origin of plant frks . group i and group ii were phylogenetically clustered together with an out group containing the frks of chlamydomonas and yeast, whereas, group iii, v and vi were clustered with different frks of chlamydomonas and yeast. these results suggested that plant frks originated before the divergence of lower eukaryotes  and land plants. moreover, group vi were independently grouped together with a yeast frk, indicating that a remote gene duplication event occurred  before the split of yeast and land plants. in addition, group iv frks were separated from the other  <dig> groups and have not grouped with the lower eukaryotes gene, indicating that frks in this group are specific to land plants.

exon/intron organization of the ssfrks family and other plant frks
in the examined plant species, the gene structures of frk were variable in both exon number and size. in group i, the exon number ranged from three to seven, while, the genes of each subgroup in this group contained similar exon numbers. in group ii, the frks had exon numbers ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  similarly genes in each of the subgroups had a similar exon number except for ssfrk <dig>  which had  <dig> more exons. these results demonstrated that the exon/intron reorganization of frks is a recent evolutionary event that occurred after the split of dicots and moncots. group iii had two exons beside the corresponding genes of the grape in which the first exon was split in two yielding a total of four exons and not three. in group iv, frks had five exons except ssfrk <dig> which harbors one additional exon originating from exonization in its corresponding first intron. in groups v and vi, frks harbored more and smaller exons than the genes in the other groups. also, the gene sizes of the frks varied among the genes in these two groups due to intron expansion. moreover, the frks in grape were found to have longer introns than other examined species, which is consistent with the results of whole genome analysis for grape genes  <cit> .

the ssfrks genes display great variation in exon numbers which range from  <dig> to  <dig>  with the introns aligning in accordance to the gt-ag rule for splicing sites . both ssfrk <dig> alleles contained one additional exon compared to its ortholog in sorghum, causing an exonization event in its third intron, indicating the gene restructured after the divergence of saccharum and sorghum and before whole genome duplication in s. spontaneum. similarly, ssfrk <dig> harbored one additional exon compared to its ortholog in sorghum. these findings present evidence that the recent whole genome duplication of s. spontaneum provided the evolutionary forces for the restructuring of the ssfrk genes.

gene expression of ssfrks among saccharum species and saccharum hybrid
the gene identification makes it possible to investigate gene expression to evaluate the potential function of the gene families. we performed comparative transcriptome profiling among three saccharum species and the saccharum hybrid at different developmental stages of seedlings with different plant hormones and five different tissues from the mature leaf  and stalks  by rna-seq method. the reads per kilobases per million reads  value of the examined genes were verified by q-rt-pcr in three tissue types from two saccharum species, s. officinarum and s. spontaneum. the results were positively correlated with rpkm values .

in all examined tissues, ssfrk <dig> was the most abundantly expressed gene among the ssfrk family, ssfrk <dig> presented the lowest expression levels , and the remaining genes showed similar expression levels. these results suggested that ssfrk <dig> was the dominant member of the gene family.fig.  <dig>

at the seedling stage, expression levels of frk1s were higher in both s.officinarum and the saccharum hybrid than in the other two species, which may be caused by that these two saccharum plants had similar genetic background. similar expression levels of ssfrks were observed in the leaves and the stems, except the frk3’s expression that was higher in the stem than in leaves. at the premature stage , the expression of frk <dig> was observed to decrease in comparison to seedling stages. in general, frks had higher expression levels in the mature period than in the premature period, suggesting that frks are involved in sugarcane sugar accumulation as mature plants contained higher sugar contents than the premature plants. the most abundantly expressed gene, frk <dig>  was observed to increase its expression levels in all analyzed leaf tissue including the leaf roll but decreased after the mature stage in some stem tissue , indicating that frk <dig> is more active in the sugar metabolism of source tissues than in that of sink tissues. similarly, frk <dig> had higher expression levels in the source tissues than the sink tissues.

polyethylene glycol  can be used to modify the osmotic potential of the nutrient solution culture and thus induce plant water deficit  <cit> . the accumulation of soluble sugars in response to drought stress has a positive correlation with the increase of leaf water contents . in the leaves of seedling with peg stress, the expression of frk <dig> was suppressed in three of the examined saccharum species  except s. spontaneum), where frk1’s expression was induced, frk2’s expression was not altered, and expression of the remaining five genes  increased. it was unexpected to observe that expression of frk <dig> and frk <dig> dramatically increased under peg treatment, and had similar or higher mrna levels than frk <dig>  these results strongly suggested that phosphorylation of fructose contributes to the sugar accumulation under peg-induced drought stress, and both frk <dig> and fkr <dig> were the main players in response to peg stress.

plant growth and development depend on the phytohormone-mediated regulation of gene expression. in this study, we analyzed the gene expression in the leaves of seedlings of saccharum plants treated with abscisic acid , auxin , ethephon , or gibberellins . gene expression levels were altered in response to aba treatment, especially for ssfrk <dig>  ssfrk <dig> and ssfrk <dig>  moreover, the gene expression of different frks varied in response to different aba treatment times. for example, ssfrk <dig> showed a tendency to increase expression levels, whereas ssfrk <dig> decreased its expression level as the aba treatment time was increased. no common shared gene expression change patterns could be identified for the frk genes, suggesting that the frks are not genes directly regulated by aba. in contrast to the aba treatment, the gene expression of frks was not noticeably affected by the iaa treatment in saccharum, except for frk <dig>  which had a more than five-fold increase in expression in the stems of s. officinarum after 24 h iaa treatment. in the leaves, ssfrk <dig> displayed a gradual decreasing trend at 24 h, 48 h and 96 h, but the trend was reversed in the stems. under et treatment, the expressions of frk <dig> was suppressed in the majority of the examined tissues. interestingly, frk <dig> was suppressed in the leaves of the saccharum hybrid and s. spontaneum for all three time points of et treatment. as for the remaining  <dig> frk genes, et treatment did not generally cause a great variation in their expression levels. similarly to the treatment of ga of saccharum plants, frk <dig> expression was inhibited in the majority of examined tissues, and the transcript of frk <dig> was inhibited in the leaf tissue in response to ga treatment at 48 h and 96 h, but was induced in the stem tissues. these results demonstrated that frks were co-expressed under ga and et treatments.

cluster analysis of gene expression showed that the frk family has a similar expression pattern in all experimental groups except for the ga treatment group, where frk7’s expression pattern resembled that of frk <dig> instead of frk <dig> .

discussion
in sugarcane, sugar metabolism is assumed to be one of the most important pathways in crop science due to its role of sugar accumulation. frk is one of the main enzymes phosphorylating fructose to fructose 6-phosphate . despite its essential role in fructose metabolism, frks are still poorly understood due to the complex sugarcane genome. genomics and expressional studies are the key step for further gene function and molecular breeding studies. the available of sorghum genome  <cit> , and the bac of s. spontaneum make it possible to identify the frk gene family members in saccharum.

gene evolution in the frk family
in this study, seven frks were identified in the sorghum genome. using sorghum frks as a reference, the same number of orthologous frks were identified in s. spontaneum. in comparison with previous studies on gene families in saccharum, such as those on the phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase gene, sucrose synthase  <cit> , atp-dependent phosphofructokinase  <cit> , and sucrose transporters  <cit> , ssfrks presented higher divergence in their protein sequences , indicating the frks are an ancient gene family. phylogenetic analysis revealed that the frk gene had undergone three rounds of gene duplication before the split of dicots and monocots , further supporting the idea that frks are an ancient gene group.

based on the phylogenetic analysis , we can estimate the origin order of gene families. in the ssfrk family, the last common ancestor  of ssfrk was suggested to have undergone gene duplication four times. ssfrk <dig> was assumed to have originated from the first gene duplication, ssfrk6/ssfrk <dig> from the second, ssfrk3/ ssfrk <dig> from third, and the remaining two genes, ssfrk <dig> and ssfrk <dig>  from the fourth. therefore, the evolutionary history of ssfrks could be sorted by age in duplicated descending order: ssfrk <dig>  ssfrk6/ssfrk <dig>  ssfrk3/ ssfrk <dig>  and ssfrk1/ssfrk <dig>  of the four gene duplication events, the related ssfrk of the first two gene duplications were clustered together with different out groups of frks, suggesting these two times duplications occurred before the split of land plants and chlamydomonas more than  <dig> billion years ago. thus, frks are belong to an ancestral gene family that existed before the origin of land plants.

sorghum is the closest diploid plant species of saccharum, and comparison of protein sequences between orthologues of sorghum and s. spontaneum may provide clues to understand the gene evolution of recent whole genome duplications in saccharum after the split of sorghum and saccharum. based on the phylogenetic analysis, ssfrk1/ssfrk <dig> is suggested to be derived from the most recent duplication in this gene family, in addition to gene pairs of both ssfrk <dig> and ssfrk <dig> alleles were under strong selection constraints , suggesting that these two genes were under functional constraint in s. spontaneum. moreover, ssfrk1/sbfrk <dig> were more conserved in their protein sequence  than ssfrk2/sbfrk <dig>  , similarly, the gene structure and protein sequences were more conserved within the allelic haplotype of ssfrk <dig> than that of ssfrk <dig> . phylogenetic analysis may explain the differences of identities between these two recent duplication gene pairs in saccharum. in the branch containing ssfrk <dig>  trib. andropogoneae dumort  only has a single gene, while the other analyzed dicot plant species had at least two genes. but in the branch containing ssfrk <dig>  all monocot plants only have one frk. one of the frks in branch containing ssfrk <dig> was lost after the divergence of trib. andropogoneae dumort in gramineae, and thus ssfrk <dig> in trib. andropogoneae dumort may replace the functional loss. therefore, the frk <dig> was under a stronger functional constraint than frk <dig> in trib. andropogoneae dumort.


frk <dig> was present in trib. andropogoneae dumort but was absent from both rice and maize, indicating that the function of frk <dig> was replaceable in the gramineae. ka/ks analysis suggesting that frk <dig> had a lower selective constraint than frk <dig>  frk <dig> and frk <dig> . it is possible that frk <dig> is functionally redundant in s. spontaneum. alternatively, frk <dig> may have been under positive selection, or demographic changes could have led to fixation of the most divergent allele in the s. spontaneum population.


ssfrk <dig> was the only ssfrk clustered with its orthologs in chlamydomonas in a branch  , moreover, the ssfrk7/sbfrk <dig> had the lowest protein sequences similarity  among the seven orthologous gene pairs. land plants and and chlamydomonas diverged over  <dig> billion years ago  <cit> . this phylogenetic results thus suggested that ssfrk <dig> had undergone a different evolution compared to other ssfrks . ka/ks analysis revealed that ssfrk <dig> had lower selective constraint than other ssfrks. furthermore, ssfrk <dig> was distinct from the other ssfrks for the protein sequence, and had the lowest gene expression levels among the ssfrks. therefore, the evolutionary mechanisms of ssfrk <dig> could be caused by its functional redundancy in s. spontaneum since the long term divergence after the lca of ssfrk <dig> and the other ssfrks.

gene expression and function in saccharum plants
gene expression analysis could provide the first direct evidence to investigate gene function due to the challenges of engineering transgenic saccharum. in this study, ssfrks were found to be in the analyzed samples at widely different expression levels. ssfrk <dig> presented the highest gene expression levels among the ssfrks, suggesting ssfrk <dig> is the key isoform involved in the phosphorylation of fru to f6p, which may further explain the rationale that this gene was the most conserved among the ssfrk. however, under peg-induced stress, the expression of frk <dig> was suppressed except in s. spontaneum, which had expression levels similar to the control. both frk <dig> and frk <dig> were induced dramatically by peg treatment, especially frk <dig>  which had higher gene expression levels than frk <dig>  therefore, frk <dig> was found to be the key isoform under normal conditions but not the key player for in the responses to peg stress. moreover, with the treatment of plant hormones at standard concentrations, our results showed that frk <dig> had the predominant expression in the frks family , suggesting that frk <dig> is the key isoform for plant growth and development. phylogenetic analysis showed that solyc06g <dig>  was the closest orthologous gene of ssfrk <dig> in tomato; this gene is the main frk in tomato plants  <cit>  and was further found to be important for vascular development  <cit> . vascular development is the foundation for sugar accumulation, pointing to the importance of frk <dig> in sugar accumulation in sacchaurm in addition to sugar metabolism.fig.  <dig> 
a expression levels of ssfrk gene family members under peg treatment. sr: s. robustum molokai6081; ss: s. spontaneum ses208; so: s. officinarum la purple; sh: hybrid cultivar roc-22; the gene expression level was based on rpkm value. b expression levels of the ssfrk gene family members under hormone treatment . sr: s. robustum molokai6081; ss: s. spontaneum ses208; so: s. officinarum la purple; sh: hybrid cultivar roc-22; in: internode; lr: leaf roll; lf: leaf. internnodes  <dig> , <dig>  internnodes  <dig> , <dig>  internodes  <dig> , <dig> and internodes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> were from saccharum officinarum , roc- <dig>  saccharum robustum  and saccharum spontaneum , respectively. the gene expression level was based on rpkm value




both frk <dig> and frk <dig> had low expression levels in the examined tissues of the saccharum, with frk <dig> having the lowest expression levels. these two genes did not present clear expression variations under peg stress and hormone treatments , suggesting that these two genes do not play a main role in fructose metabolism. however, frk <dig> was under strong selective constraint within the alleles and in comparison to sorghum, while frk <dig> was under neutral selection. therefore, we suspected that frk <dig> had undergone a key functional division for the plant development, whereas frk <dig> was functionally redundant in s. spontaneum. the close ortholog of the ssfrk <dig> gene in tomato  is specifically expressed in the anthers during the late stages of pollen development and during pollen germination and has very low expression levels in the other tissues  <cit> . it is possible that frk <dig> is involved in the reproductive system of saccharum as this frk has low expression in the leaf and stem tissues. further analysis of frks gene expression in the development of pollen and anthers would be necessary to investigate the potential function of frk <dig> in saccharum plants.


frk <dig> and frk <dig> were both dramatically induced by peg treatment, therefore, the three frks including frk <dig>  frk <dig> and frk <dig> were predominant expression under drought stress . these results revealed that frk <dig> and frk <dig> played a main role in response to drought stress in saccharum, and indicated that the phosphorylation of glc to g6p and fru to f6p were involved in response to drought stress in saccharum. in another main sugar crop, sugar beet  roots, frk activity was observed to increase in response to wound stress  <cit> . in sunflower , under drought stress, a plastid frk is co-upregulated with other genes related to carbon metabolism  <cit> . in maize, frk <dig> is upregulated in response to short-term salt stress  <cit> . in plants, frks are thought to be commonly involved in responses to abiotic stress. in contrast to frk <dig>  the expression levels of frk <dig> were generally suppressed by et and ga in young premature saccharum plants plants, but increased in more mature tissues. gas generally promote plant growth and greatly influence plant stature and organ size, while et regulates stress-related responses and/or growth retardation. therefore, frk <dig> was suggested to play a role for plant growth in addition to stress tolerance response in saccharum.



frk <dig> and frk <dig> had the closest expression profiles in most of the experiments from this study. similarly to frk <dig>  the transcripts of frk <dig> increased in the mature tissues of saccharum  and under peg stress , supporting the idea that frks contribute to sugar accumulation and stress tolerance. moreover, unlike frk <dig>  the gene expression of these two frks was not sensitive to the hormone treatments in the saccharum plants. it was deduced that frk <dig> and frk <dig> were supposed to have different functional divisions to frk <dig> for plant growth and development. in addition, frk <dig> only presented a slight increase in its expression levels under peg-induced drought stress, indicating that frk <dig> is not the major player in the response to drought stress in the frk family in saccharum.

nevertheless, frks are considered to be the key enzymes for sugar metabolism in plants  <cit> . in this study, we observed that frks generally have higher expression levels in mature tissues than in premature tissues , supporting the idea that frk genes contribute to sugar accumulation as the mature tissues contained higher sugar content. however, in this study, there was no correlation between gene expression levels of frks and sugar content among the saccharum species. similarly, in our previous study for suts, no correlation was observed between gene expression levels of suts and sugar content in the saccharum species  <cit> . these results suggest that the variation of sugar contents among the saccharum species may not depend on the difference of gene expression of a small scales of sugar metabolism genes.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, by combining comparative genomics approaches with bacs, we identified the fructokinase gene family consisting of seven members in s. spontaneum. we performed a comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary genesis, gene alleles, phylogenetic relationships, and gene expression patterns for the identified frks in saccharum plants. the results suggest that the frk gene family is an ancient gene family with ancestral lca, and their evolution history could be sorted by age in duplicated descending order: ssfrk <dig>  ssfrk6/ssfrk <dig>  ssfrk3/ ssfrk <dig>  and ssfrk1/ssfrk <dig>  moreover, individual frks were analyzed. frk <dig> was under strong functional selection constraint and was conserved among the gene allelic haplotypes, in addition frk <dig> displaying the highest expression levels among the other frks under normal condition, suggesting that frk <dig> plays the leading role in phosphorylating fru to f6p for plant development. frk <dig> and frk <dig> were identified as the key genes in response to drought stress. frk <dig> was likely play a prominent role in plant growth in addition to stress tolerance response in saccharum. frk <dig> and frk <dig> had lower expression than the other gene members, whereas frk <dig> was under strong genomic selection constraint; frk <dig> was under neutral selection. frk <dig> may have undergone a functional division in saccharum in agreement with the study of the ssfrk <dig> ortholog in tomato. frk <dig> might be functionally redundant in saccharum as a result of the process of pseudogenization. frk <dig> and frk <dig> had the closest expression pattern. frk <dig> was revealed to have higher expression levels in mature tissues than in premature tissues of saccharum, supporting the hypothesis that this gene contributes to the sugar accumulation in saccharum plants. frk <dig> presented slightly increase under drought stress. to investigate the function of these genes under stress, further experiments such as characterizing the spatio-temporal expression, enzyme activity assay, and targeted gene knock out technology like crispr-cas <dig> system, would be necessary. this study may offer foundation work for the future study of the ssfrk gene family to characterize the physiological role and molecular mechanisms leading to sugar accumulation in sugarcane.
