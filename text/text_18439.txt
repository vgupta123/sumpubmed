BACKGROUND
the asian corn borer , ostrinia furnacalis   is the most destructive lepidopteran pest of corn in asia, particularly in china and the philippines. acb larvae damage corn by attacking the new leaves, ears and cobs; these pests also bore into the stalks and cobs of corn  <cit> . the damage manifested by acb infestation constitutes a major constraint on agriculture in corn-producing countries worldwide. yield losses caused by the acb are estimated at  <dig> to 20% in an ordinary year but may be more than 30% or may even result in no harvest in an outbreak year  <cit> . moreover, the corn borer is considered an aggravating factor for the epidemiology of fusarium ear rot in maize, and insect damage to ears can increase the fumonisin contamination of kernels  <cit> . novel insecticides with high selective activity are preferred to control this insect pest. recently, two classes of diamide chemicals have emerged as novel insecticides targeting insect ryrs: the phthalic diamides, including flubendiamide  <cit> , and the anthranilic diamides, including chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole  <cit> . these diamides have potent species-specific insecticidal activity against a range of lepidopteran pest species and can elicit intracellular ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum or endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . yang et al. reported that chlorantraniliprole provided excellent control efficacy against second-generation acb and was relatively safe to the spider xysticus ephippiatus. in addition, we previously demonstrated that flubendiamide also showed high efficacy against the acb. consequently, these diamide insecticides are suitable for integrated pest management programs for the regulation of the acb  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms of the acb in response to diamide insecticides are not clearly understood.

despite the insect’s importance in agricultural production, the sequence information available for the acb lies in contrast to the economic importance of this pest. the current understanding of this pest has largely been hindered by the lack of thorough genetic information. until recently, no complete picture has been achieved, even of specific gene families. for example, cytochrome p450s  have been highly recognized as a supergene family, with  <dig> to  <dig> genes in insect genomes  <cit> , while only one cyp gene with a full-length coding region was accessed for the acb in genbank. this scarcity of genetic information for the acb has also resulted in a paucity of genetic studies and integrated theories for understanding the basic biology of this pest.

the aim of the present study was to use pgm sequencing to produce a de novo transcriptome of the acb as a resource for current and future studies of this pest species. this resource was subsequently used as a reference to provide insights into insecticide-related changes in gene expression in flubendiamide-treated acb and to identify a broad range of genes encoding the target proteins and detoxification enzymes of insecticides currently in use for acb control.

RESULTS
rna-seq and sequence assembly
when two acb libraries  were sequenced using the pgm platform, the output was  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb. after trimming the adaptor sequences and removing the low-quality reads,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads were generated from the control and flubendiamide-treated libraries, with average sequence lengths of  <dig> and 265 bp, respectively. the clean reads of the two libraries  were assembled into  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigene sequences, with average unigene lengths of  <dig> and 756 bp, respectively. a summary of the pgm sequencing and assembly is presented in table  <dig>  and the length distributions for the clean reads and unigenes are presented in fig.  <dig> table  <dig> an overview of the sequencing and assembly process of the acb

analysis of the transcripts from the asian corn borer
blastx and blastn were used to compare each acb transcript with a cut-off e-value of  <dig> e− <dig> against genbank entries. a total of  <dig>  transcripts  had blastx hits in non-redundant protein  databases, and  <dig>  transcripts  had blastn hits in non-redundant nucleotide sequence  databases. some of the acb transcripts were homologous to those from more than one species, but in general, most acb transcripts were homologous to lepidoptera species, accounting for  <dig> hits among the  <dig>  blastn hits, including  <dig> hits  to bombyx mori entries,  <dig> hits  to ostrinia nubilalis, and  <dig> hits  to ostrinia nubilalis. the second highest hits were to dipteran species, with  <dig> hits to culex quinquefasciatus and  <dig> and  <dig> hits to the anopheles gambiae and drosophila ananassae, respectively. the top  <dig> insect species with significant blastn hits are shown in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> top  <dig> insect species with significant blastn hits. all acb unigenes were used in blastn searches against the genbank entries. the significant hits with e-values ≤  <dig> e− <dig> for each query were grouped according to species, and the numbers of unigenes with significant homology are indicated after the species name




unigene function annotation
to analyze the putative protein functions, the clusters of orthologous groups  database was used to predict and classify the potential functions of the identified unigenes. using sequence homology,  <dig>  unigenes  were annotated and divided into  <dig> specific categories . among the cog classifications, the cluster of general function  was the largest, followed by signal transduction mechanisms  and posttranslational modification, protein turnover, and chaperones . the categories nuclear structure , defense mechanisms  and cell motility  represented the smallest groups.fig.  <dig> clusters of orthologous groups  classification




we used the gene ontology  database to obtain functional annotations of the acb unigenes  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  transcripts  were assigned to at least one go term in three categories: biological processes, cellular component and molecular function . the three categories were further classified into  <dig> functional subcategories , among which cell and cell part in the cellular component, catalytic activity and binding in the molecular function, and cellular processes and metabolic processes in the biological processes represented the major subcategories, while fewer than  <dig> unigenes were observed in translation regulator activity , synapse , synapse part , virion , cell killing , and channel regulator activity . some unigenes were assigned to multiple go term categories, while others could not be assigned to a given go term. the biological process terms were primarily associated with cellular processes, such as proteolysis, carbohydrate metabolic processes and oxidation-reduction utilization. similar compositions and distributions of unigenes assigned to go terms have been reported in transcriptomics descriptions from other insects  <cit> .fig.  <dig> gene ontology classification of assembled unigenes. the right y-axis indicates the number of genes in a category, whereas the left y-axis indicates the percentage of a specific category of genes in that main category




unigene metabolic pathway analysis
the unigene metabolic pathway analysis was conducted using the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  annotation system. a total of  <dig> unigenes  were mapped to  <dig> kegg pathways . the most enriched pathways included metabolic pathways, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, purine metabolism, focal adhesion, phagosome, spliceosome, and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum and the ribosome. these annotations provide a valuable resource for the investigation of specific processes, functions and pathways in the acb.

transcripts encoding detoxification enzymes and insecticide targets
the known mechanisms underlying insecticide resistance in the acb include decreased penetration, increased detoxification and target insensitivity. to screen genes that may evolve insecticide resistance, we mined the current transcriptomics data to identify unigenes encoding insecticide targets or detoxification enzymes. a number of sequences homologous to detoxification enzymes  and insecticide targets were identified.

a total of  <dig> p450-related unigenes were identified from the nr annotation of the acb transcriptome. after manually removing allelic variants of the same p <dig> gene and unigenes with short open reading frames  <600 bp, the remaining  <dig> p <dig> unigene sequences  were used to construct a phylogenetic tree. based on the closest blast hits in the ncbi nr database and the phylogenetic analysis with p <dig> genes from b. mori, the p450s were assigned to one of four cyp clans: cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> and the mitochondrial clan. cyp <dig> ranked as the largest clan, consisting of  <dig> members belonging to the cyp <dig> family and seven genes belonging to the cyp <dig> family. the cyp <dig> clan included five p450s from the cyp <dig> family, and the remaining p <dig> genes belonged to the mitochondrial  and cyp <dig>  clans, which might be involved in the ecdysteroid metabolism pathway  and essential physiological functions , respectively .fig.  <dig> neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis of the cytochrome p450s from ostrinia furnacalis  and bombyx mori . the tree was constructed from the multiple alignments using mega <dig>  software and generated with  <dig> bootstrap trials using the neighbor-joining method. the numbers indicate the bootstrap confidence values obtained for each node after  <dig> repetitions. positions containing alignment gaps and missing data were eliminated with pairwise deletion




we also identified  <dig> gst unigenes from the nr annotation,  <dig> of which were unique and manually curated . based on the closest blast hits in the ncbi nr database and the phylogenetic analysis, these unigenes were assigned to epsilon, delta, theta, zeta, omega, sigma, and microsomal classes .fig.  <dig> neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis of the glutathione s-transferases from ostrinia furnacalis , bombyx mori  and heliothis virescens . the tree was constructed from the multiple alignments using mega <dig>  software and generated with  <dig> bootstrap trials using the neighbor-joining method. the numbers indicate the bootstrap confidence values obtained for each node after  <dig> repetitions. positions containing alignment gaps and missing data were eliminated with pairwise deletion




a total of  <dig> unigenes with cce protein motifs were identified. among these,  <dig> unigenes were manually curated , as some of the original sequences were either allelic variants of the same cce gene or contained short orfs. based on phylogenetic analyses with other known cce genes from other insect species, these  <dig> sequences were assigned to the known classes of cces .fig.  <dig> neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis of carboxyl/cholinesterases from ostrinia furnacalis , bombyx mori  and schistosoma haematobium . the tree was constructed from the multiple alignments using mega <dig>  software and generated with  <dig> bootstrap trials using the neighbor-joining method. the numbers indicate the bootstrap confidence values obtained for each node after  <dig> repetitions. positions containing alignment gaps and missing data were eliminated with pairwise deletion




in addition, a number of unigenes encoding insecticide target proteins, including acetylcholinesterase , the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits , the gamma-aminobutyric acid  receptor, the glutamate-gated chloride channel , the voltage-gated sodium channel  and the ryanodine receptor , were also identified in the acb transcriptome .table  <dig> unigenes related to insecticide target sites in the acb




gene expression profile analysis of responses to flubendiamide
the acb mrna samples used for constructing the cdna library were non-normalized and non-amplified by pcr; thus, the reads in the sequencing dataset most likely represent the relative abundance level of each assembled transcript. to determine whether flubendiamide treatment resulted in statistically significant changes in gene expression, the level of gene expression was determined after normalizing the number of genes in each library to reads per kb per million reads . compared with the control, a total of  <dig> genes were affected in the flubendiamide-treated strain, including  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes . more genes were expressed in flubendiamide-treated acb group  than in the control .table  <dig> summary of the differentially expressed unigenes




experimental validation
to confirm the quality of the transcriptome data and the differential expression results from sequencing and computational analyses,  <dig> up-regulated genes  and  <dig> down-regulated genes  were randomly selected for further analysis. these genes were amplified using qrt-pcr, and the qrt-pcr assessments confirmed the direction of change in gene expression based on differential gene expression  analysis . cuticular protein, protease and oxidoreductase had much lower expression levels in response to flubendiamide treatment, while detoxification enzyme , muscle contraction-related , immunoglobulin , heat shock protein  <dig> and chemosensory protein genes were significantly overexpressed.fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr validation of the differently expressed genes. fifteen up-regulated genes and thirteen down-regulated genes were identified using qrt-pcr. the  <dig> up-regulated genes included three esterase genes , two cytochrome p <dig> genes , three hemolin genes , two twitchin genes , two heat shock protein genes , two tropomyosin genes  and one chemosensory protein gene . the  <dig> down-regulated genes included three cuticular protein genes , three protease genes , four oxidoreductase genes , one neuronal pentraxin gene , one glutathione s-transferase gene  and one cytochrome p <dig> gene . the left y-axis indicates the relative expression levels based on qrt-pcr, and the right y-axis indicates the log <dig> ratio of f-treated/control based on dge analysis. error bars indicate the average deviations of the three replicates




discussion
the acb is the most destructive corn-stalk-boring pest in the countries of east and southeast asia, the pacific and australasia. in some cases, entire harvests are lost in an outbreak year  <cit> . however, a lack of genetic information is still a barrier to our knowledge of this insect pest. ngs, developed for rapid sequencing and transcriptomics research, has enabled the use of rna-seq and dge methods to analyze the acb transcriptome and insecticide mechanisms  <cit> .

for the acb, as a non-model insect without a reference genome sequence, the clean reads were assembled de novo using the short reads assembling programs mira and cap <dig>  a total of  <dig>  unigenes with a mean length of 716 bp were obtained from the transcriptome analysis. the average length of the unigenes for acb in the present study was longer than those observed in plutella xylostella   <cit>  and liposcelis bostrychophila   <cit>  but shorter than those in blattella germanica   <cit>  and agrotis ipsilon   <cit> . the length of the unigenes may be related to the sequencing technique and assembly tools used. blast searches against public databases, such as nt, nr, swiss-prot, go, cog and kegg, provided annotation data for the acb. as expected, the acb transcripts were homologous to those from more than one species, but most were homologous to lepidoptera species. the silkworm, b. mori, returned the most blast hits against the acb transcripts. this result could reflect the fact that b. mori is a lepidoptera species with a completely sequenced genome  <cit> .

insecticide detoxification occurs in all insects, and a number of enzymes with insecticide detoxification mechanisms, encoded by members of the p <dig>  gst and cce multi-gene families, have been identified  <cit> . cytochrome p450s are an important enzyme class involved in the metabolism of endogenous substances, such as hormones, fatty acids and steroids, and xenobiotics, such as drugs, pesticides and plant secondary metabolites  <cit> . the p <dig> genes represent a large and highly diverse gene family in different species. cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> p <dig> families in insect species have been implicated in the metabolism of plant secondary metabolites and synthetic insecticides  <cit> . in acb, the identified cytochrome p450s were assigned to four cyp clans: cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> and the mitochondrial clan; cyp <dig> was the largest clan. together, the members of the cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> families account for  <dig> % of the total p450s, indicating that the acb, similar to other insects, arms itself with a potent capacity for metabolizing various xenobiotics. it has been reported that some p <dig> genes belonging to the cyp  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> families are involved in insecticide resistance  <cit> . for example, the cytochrome p <dig> gene cyp6bq <dig> was recently shown to be the main factor causing pyrethroid resistance in m. aeneus across europe through its hydroxylation of the alcohol moiety of pyrethroids to a less toxic hydroxy metabolite  <cit> . in b. tabaci and m. persicae, the cytochrome p <dig>  over expression contributes to neonicotinoid insecticide resistance because these enzymes can catalyze a more rapid conversion of imidacloprid to its less active form, 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid  <cit> . moreover, rna interference-mediated gene silencing  tests revealed that cyp6bg <dig> overexpression results in permethrin resistance  <cit> . in the present study, flubendiamide treatment led to up-regulated expression levels of the unigenes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  annotated to cyp337b <dig>  cyp9g <dig>  cyp4c <dig> and cyp9f <dig>  respectively. cyp337b <dig> is a chimeric enzyme, capable of metabolizing fenvalerate into non-toxic 4′-hydroxyfenvalerate  <cit> . li et al. reported that cyp9g <dig> plays important roles in the responses to phoxim and cypermethrin metabolism in bombyx mandarina  <cit> . methanol exposure significantly up-regulated cyp9f <dig> mrna expression; thus, the resulting protein was suggested as a candidate enzyme for methanol metabolism in drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . in the present study, these overexpressed p <dig> genes might improve the metabolism and detoxification capacity of the acb to flubendiamide, and unigenes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> could be involved in the flubendiamide resistance of the acb.

known cces can be divided into  <dig> clades; clades a to c are involved in insecticide detoxification  <cit> . unigene  <dig>  localized with mitochondrial, cytosolic and secreted esterases, showed  <dig> -fold up-regulation after flubendiamide treatment. this esterase gene might be related to flubendiamide detoxification in the acb. unigenes  <dig> and  <dig>  annotated to antennal carboxylesterases, were also dramatically up-regulated. in insects, antennal carboxylesterase plays an important role in the rapid degradation of odorants.

a total of eight classes of gsts are known; among these, delta and epsilon gsts are unique to insects and appear to play important roles in xenobiotic detoxification and insecticide resistance  <cit> . in the acb transcriptome, five gsts belonging to the delta and epsilon classes were identified; hence, it is likely that these five gsts may have similar roles in flubendiamide detoxification in acb. among the other classes of gsts, such as the omega class, the number of genes identified in the acb  was larger than those in b. mori, l. bostrychophila, a. gambiae and a. mellifera  <cit> . for the sigma and theta classes of gsts, the numbers of genes  in the acb were consistent with those from b. mori, and three genes were shown to encode microsomal gsts, members of which are known in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism  <cit> .

five types of genes encoding insecticide target proteins, including the ache, nachrs, gaba receptor, glucl, vgsc and ryr, were identified in the acb transcriptome. although many of these genes were not full-length sequences, this information will nevertheless facilitate further characterization of these targets using pcr and/or random amplification of cdna ends . insect aches have received much interest, reflecting their role in neurotransmission and because these genes are the principal targets of organophosphate and carbamate insecticides. three unigenes were identified as containing the ace gene in the present study. the nachrs represent a diverse family of cys-loop ligand-gated ion channels. ten to twelve nachr-type receptor gene families have been reported in insects  <cit> . in the present study, five alpha and two beta subunits were also identified as acb nachrs. in contrast,  <dig> nachr gene families were identified in b. mori  <cit> , while  <dig> nachr gene families were identified in a. gambiae  <cit> . the gaba receptors also belong to a superfamily of cys-loop neurotransmitter receptors. mutation of the gaba-regulated chloride channel can lead to resistance to organochlorine and phenylpyrazole insecticides  <cit> . some insect pest populations have evolved modifications of the vgsc protein, which prevent the binding of insecticides , resulting in the insect developing resistance.

ryrs are members of a superfamily of intracellular ca2+ channels. these channels regulate the release of calcium from the lumen of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol of muscle and non-muscle cells. insect ryrs are the targets of two classes of diamide chemicals  <cit> . the homomeric tetramer ryr is the largest known ion channel, with each monomer consisting of approximately  <dig> amino acids. a total of six unigenes were identified as part of the o. furnacalis ryr  gene, with the longest unigene being 4420 bp. in the present study, the ofryr gene was up-regulated after flubendiamide exposure compared with the control, but this difference was not statistically significant. actually, the gene expression of ryr changed depending on insect’s life cycle. the expression level of ryr differed among different developmental stages. for example, the ofryr showed the lowest expression level in egg and the highest in adult  <cit> . meanwhile, the pxryr was highly expressed in the second-instar larvae and adults, and their relative expression levels were  <dig>  and  <dig>  times than that in the prepupae, which showed the lowest expression level of pxryr  <cit> . furthermore, the genes involved in calcium signaling and muscle control pathways, such as the twitchin genes , were also significantly overexpressed after flubendiamide treatment. these results suggested that pathways involving multiple genes, such as calcium signaling, muscle control and metabolic pathways, play dominant roles in flubendiamide exposure.

studying the temporal transcriptome responses of insects to xenobiotics could lead to the discovery of novel molecular mechanisms contributing to insecticide detoxification and tolerance. gene expression analysis after flubendiamide exposure will significantly complement and enrich the acb gene expression data and facilitate the discovery of novel genes, gene functions and insecticidal targets of the acb. in insects, the response to environmental stress triggers the expression of various proteins, including heat shock proteins, metallothioneins or p-glycoprotein  <cit> . the data obtained in the present study revealed that the transcription levels of heat shock protein  <dig> genes were significantly up-regulated in response to flubendiamide exposure. however, some genes encoding enzymes involved in the production of cellular catabolism, such as trypsin and serine protease, were down-regulated in the acb in response to flubendiamide, and the cuticular protein genes also showed much lower expression levels in flubendiamide treatment. the down-regulation of cuticular-related proteins indicated that flubendiamide might play a role in thinning the cuticles in the acb. indeed, thickened cuticles affect the rates of insecticide penetration  <cit> . thus, thinned cuticles will accelerate the transportation of flubendiamide to the target and improve its insecticidal efficacy.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the present study represents a functional transcriptome analysis of the acb. the differential gene expression data elucidated the molecular mechanisms of the acb in response to the novel diamide insecticide flubendiamide. in addition, this investigation will facilitate identification of the genes involved in insecticide resistance and may assist in designing new compounds or other strategies for the control of the acb.
