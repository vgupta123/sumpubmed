BACKGROUND
sessile higher plants evolved various strategies to adapt to chilling conditions. among other transcriptional and metabolic responses to cold temperatures plants accumulate a range of solutes including amino acids, glucosides or sugars. although the precise function of sugars remains to be elucidated, their accumulation suggests roles as osmoregulators, cryoprotectants or signaling molecules. in mature potato tubers, the accumulation of soluble sugars during cold adaptation is referred to as cold induced sweetening   <cit> . the sugars sucrose, glucose and fructose accumulating in photosynthetic inactive tissues like potato tubers are recruited from starch degradation  <cit> . enzymes involved in starch and sugar metabolism have been identified and studied intensively in potato and other plants at the biochemical and molecular level  <cit> . however, the regulation of this process is not entirely understood. various enzymes, such as amylase, udp glucose pyrophosphorylase or invertase, have been suggested to control the level of cis in tubers either by increased or suppressed expression or activity  <cit> . the activity of invertase, which converts sucrose into glucose and fructose, is apparently subject to post-translational regulation by proteinaceous inhibitors  <cit> .

beside functions in plant adaption to cold temperatures cis is an important issue for the potato processing industry. long term storage of potato tubers at low temperatures is advantageous to reduce sprouting, thereby extending marketability. however, high concentrations of the reducing sugars glucose and fructose, either inherently or caused by cis, negatively affect the quality of processed food products such as potato chips and french fries  <cit> .

potato cultivars show extensive natural variation in cis capacity  <cit> . diversity in tuber sugar content might be explained by the variation of abundance and/or activity of carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes in source  and sink tissues , and by variable flux of sucrose from source to sink. knowledge of the molecular basis of the diversity will contribute to the deciphering of plant cold adaptation and the development of diagnostic markers that can be used to select cultivars with low capacity of sugar accumulation and therefore improved processing quality.

tuber starch and sugar content are quantitative traits controlled by multiple genetic and environmental factors. molecular linkage mapping of quantitative trait loci  and candidate genes revealed co-localization of some qtl for tuber starch and sugar content with genes functional in carbohydrate metabolism or transport  <cit> . more recently, association genetics demonstrated that dna polymorphisms in genes encoding invertases and starch phosphorylases were associated with potato chip color, starch content and starch yield  <cit> . the genetic analyses support the working model that natural variation in tuber starch and sugar content is controlled by allelic variants of enzymes that function in starch and sugar metabolism. however, this model explains only part of the observed genetic variation.

to identify novel factors influencing sugar accumulation in tubers, unbiased and comprehensive approaches such as transcriptome and proteome profiling are required. microarray hybridization experiments using a tomato gene chip hybridized with potato rna allowed the identification of known as well as novel genes that were differentially expressed during tuber cold storage in a single potato genotype. transcript levels of known candidate genes, such as invertase, were correlated with sugar accumulation  <cit> . analyzing the proteome captures both the variation of transcript abundance and the variation of post-transcriptional processes in biological samples, and differential expression of proteins reflects the translated genome in any environment or stress  <cit> . comparative proteome analysis has previously proven successful in identifying new candidate genes for controlling tuber quality traits  <cit> .

the objective of this study was to decipher the molecular basis of natural variation in tuber reducing sugar content  and cold induced sweetening  ability in elite breeding materials of solanum tuberosum. using 2d-page  we compared the tuber proteome of forty potato cultivars showing high diversity in tuber reducing sugar content and detected correlations between the expression level of distinct proteins and rsc. in addition a cold storage experiment was performed to tackle proteins differentially expressed in response to cold treatment as well as between cis-tolerant  and cis-sensitive  cultivars. comparative 2d-page protein profiling of pools of cis-tolerant and cis-sensitive genotypes at certain time points during cold storage identified at least fifty differentially expressed proteins. snps at two selected candidate loci encoding proteins either correlated with rsc or differentially expressed between cis-tolerant and cis-sensitive cultivars throughout cold storage were tested for association with tuber starch and chip quality in order to validate their potential role in controlling natural variation of these traits. our approach led to the discovery of novel, potential regulatory genes that have not been connected so far to plant carbohydrate metabolism.

RESULTS
tuber reducing sugar content  before and after cold treatment
tuber rsc was determined before and after cold treatment in  <dig> cultivars pre-selected for high  and low  chip quality. before cold storage, rsc varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  percent dry weight . the ranking of cultivars corresponded to their prior allocation based on chip quality with two exceptions . during twelve weeks of storage at 4°c, rsc increased in all cultivars . cultivars exhibiting low rsc values before cold storage showed a higher increase in rsc during cold storage compared to cultivars with high initial rsc values. however, the ranking of cultivars according to rsc before and after 4 weeks cold storage was in high agreement with their assignment to high and low chip quality. in conclusion, rsc was highly indicative for chip quality and vice versa.

correlation between rsc and protein spot intensity without cold treatment
total soluble protein of tubers of the  <dig> cultivars before cold treatment was separated by 2d-page. an average of  <dig> protein spots was detected per gel . twenty six protein spots were selected based on being present in more than 70% of all gels of the  <dig> cultivars including biological replicates, and quantified by measuring spot intensity. the data for mean rsc and spot intensities are provided in additional file 2: table s <dig>  the spot intensity of five proteins correlated significantly  with rsc . the most significant correlation was found for a protein identified as ‘putative kunitz-type tuber invertase inhibitor’ . decreasing protein spot intensity correlated with increasing rsc. negative correlation coefficients were also obtained for two proteins identified as ‘miraculin’ and ‘potato proteinase inhibitor class ii’ . two further proteins spots, both identified as ‘granule bound starch synthase’ were positively correlated with rsc .

comparative protein profiling during cold treatment
based on the accumulation of reducing sugars during cold treatment   <dig> cultivars were selected, five each with the lowest  and highest  rsc values . total soluble protein was extracted from tubers of the cis-t and cis-s cultivars prior to  and after  <dig>   <dig> and 12 weeks of cold treatment . at each time point two protein pools were created. the first pool was made of equimolar amounts of proteins from cis-t cultivars and the second from cis-s cultivars. the protein pools were separated by 2d-page under two different conditions to resolve proteins of different size classes . by comparing protein profiles of the genotype pools cis-t and cis-s, protein spots were identified that showed quantitative as well as qualitative differences at one or more time points. fifty protein spots  showed a minimum of a two-fold difference in spot intensity between genotype pools cis-t and cis-s at least at one time point . the kinetics of the spot intensities during cold treatment and genomic positions of the corresponding genes are shown in additional file 4: table s <dig>

2w, 4w and 12w corresponds to weeks of storage at 4°c.

thirty six of fifty differential protein spots were assigned to various protease inhibitors , isoforms of the storage protein patatin, a lipoxygenase , a phospholipase a <dig> , phosphoglycerate kinase , several heat shock proteins , a leucine aminopeptidase , pathogenesis related protein  <dig>  and an actin . the largest group corresponded to protease inhibitors.

twenty eight protein spots were differentially expressed before the onset of cold treatment, seventeen at higher level in genotype pool cis-t and eleven in pool cis-s. for example, three series of spots identified as lox , pla <dig>  and lap  showed higher expression in pool cis-t compared to pool cis-s. in contrast, kunitz-type protease inhibitors  and hsp’s  were more abundant in pool cis-s versus cis-t.

significant differential expression of eighteen proteins was maintained at all time-points during cold treatment. of major interest are spots  <dig> and  <dig>  which migrated at different pi and molecular weight but were assigned to the same miraculin accession when searching the ncbi protein database. the tryptic peptides matched to different loci on chromosomes iii and xii in the potato genome sequence  <cit> . the miraculin gene on chromosome iii was consistently higher expressed in pool cis-t and the miraculin gene on chromosome xii in pool cis-s .

additional expression patterns observed were: induction by cold treatment either in genotype pool cis-t  or cis-s  or in both pools , either transiently  or continuously , or repression by cold treatment, either in pool cis-t  or cis-s  or in both pools .

genomic organization of candidate genes and association with tuber quality traits
single nucleotide polymorphisms  at two loci encoding the differentially expressed proteins ‘putative kunitz-type tuber invertase inhibitor’  and ‘chloroplastic leucine aminopeptidase’  were tested for association with tuber quality traits in the chips-all association mapping population  <cit> .

a) putative kunitz-type tuber invertase inhibitor 
blast analysis of the corresponding nucleotide sequence  against the potato genome sequence  <cit>  and the genebank nucleotide core collection revealed  <dig> % sequence identity with the locus pgsc0003dmg <dig> on superscaffold pgsc0003dmb <dig>  and 99% sequence identity with potato bac clones ba259d <dig> and bc135n <dig>  <cit> . this positioned kt-invinh within a mixed cluster of protease inhibitor gene families at the stki locus on potato chromosome iii  <cit> . locus specific primers were designed based on unique sequences flanking gene pgsc0003dmg <dig>  which were used to generate and sequence an amplicon from the individuals of the chips-all population. fourteen snps and one insertion/deletion  polymorphism  were evaluated for association with tuber starch content , tuber yield , tuber starch yield , chip quality after harvest in autumn  and after cold storage  . nine snps and the indel were associated with tsc and tsy. the snps fell into three haplotype groups with highly similar distribution in the chips-all population and therefore similar associations. all minor frequency snp alleles increased average tsc and tsy . few small associations  were found with ty .

1alleles with highly similar distribution in the chips-all population and similar associations are shown in parentheses. snp alleles forming the minor frequency haplotype are italics.

2ns: not significant. the level of significance is indicated by * for  <dig>  > p > <dig> , ** for  <dig>  > p > <dig>  and *** for p < <dig> . arrows indicate the direction of effect of the minor frequency allele, which increased average tuber starch content, starch yield and chip quality in all cases.

b) chloroplastic leucine aminopeptidase 
blast searches with the cdna sequence x <dig> corresponding to the differential lap protein against the potato genome sequence  <cit>  identified superscaffold pgsc0003dmb <dig> , which contained a single gene model annotated as ‘neutral lap’ . the same superscaffold contained the marker loci agpaseb-b  and gp <dig> <cit> , which anchored the superscaffold to the distal part of the long arm of potato chromosome xii. the sequence x <dig> clearly matched to two regions , indicating a tandem repeat of two lap genes with ten exons each, located within a  <dig> kbp region of superscaffold pgsc0003dmb <dig> . the genomic organization was confirmed by aligning tomato lap sequences u <dig>  and af <dig>  with the superscaffold. the cdna sequence of accession x <dig> was more similar to sllapa  than to sllapn  and stlapn , indicating that the differential protein annotated as ‘chloroplastic leucine aminopeptidase’ corresponded to stlapa. a specific amplicon suitable for sequencing and snp detection could only be obtained from the physically closely linked stlapn gene. seventeen snps and one indel  were tested for association with the tuber traits in the chips-all population. four snps were associated with one or more tuber trait, two of which showed only very small effects . snp <dig> showed highly significant associations with tuber starch content , tuber starch yield , chip quality after harvest  and chip quality after cold storage . cultivars containing the minor frequency allele a <dig> showed significant increased average trait values . furthermore, when scored in the  <dig> cultivars evaluated for rsc during cold storage, the snp allele a <dig> was detected in  <dig> cultivars, preferentially in cultivars with low rsc and particularly after four weeks cold storage . this observation was confirmed when the  <dig> cultivars were grouped based on presence and absence of the snp allele a <dig> and tested for difference between the rsc group means. at all time-points, the genotypic group having at least one dosage of the a <dig> allele accumulated significantly lower amounts of reducing sugars than the group homozygous for the allele g <dig> . the positive effect of snp <dig> increased during cold storage, consistent with the result obtained in the chips-all population.

discussion
comparative proteomics in combination with association genetics was used to decipher the molecular basis of natural variation in reducing sugar accumulation and cis-tolerance in potato tubers. we identified proteins, the abundance of which correlated with tuber sugar content. moreover, we identified proteins showing differential expression between groups of cultivars with high and low cis-tolerance before and during cold storage.

differential protein levels may be the cause or the consequence of the process leading to a phenotype such as tuber sugar content. the genes controlling phenotypic variation are a subset of all genes that have a metabolic, structural or regulatory function in phenotypic expression. accordingly, dna polymorphisms should be present in coding or regulatory regions of causal genes that are associated with the phenotypic variation. comparative protein profiling and association genetics are therefore complementary approaches for zooming in on genes controlling complex traits. dna polymorphisms at two loci encoding the differential proteins kt-invinh and stlapa were associated with tuber quality traits like tuber starch content, tuber starch yield or chip quality. consequently, they represent good candidate genes for contributing to the natural variation in tuber rsc and cis tolerance. to be useful for breeding applications, the genetic material used for association analysis should originate from state of the art breeding programs. our association panel, which consisted of varieties and advanced clones of commercial breeding programs in central europe fulfilled this criterion  <cit> . the newly discovered snps associated with chip quality, tuber starch content and starch yield in this genetic material can be used for marker assisted selection of superior processing cultivars.

for the identification of proteins up or down regulated in response to cold treatment and influencing natural variation in cis tolerance we compared tuber protein profiles of cis-s and cis-t genotype pools during cold storage. the majority of the differential protein spots  showed significant differences between genotype pools cis-t and cis-s before the onset of cold treatment . these differences were generally maintained throughout cold storage. consequently, our results suggest that these constitutive differences in protein expression are involved in that part of rsc, which is independent from cold treatment.

among the differential spots were novel proteins such as leucine aminopeptidase that has not been considered so far to play a role in starch-sugar interconversion. others like differential heat shock proteins corroborated previous findings  <cit> . in contrast, several genes known to be associated with tuber sugar and starch content  <cit>  were not detected as differentially expressed proteins, most likely due to limited resolution and sensitivity of 2d-page. nevertheless, this study demonstrates that comparative proteomics is suitable to identify novel candidate genes and yields results complementary to association mapping based on functional and positional candidate genes.

proteins correlated with tuber sugar content
the most significant correlation was found for a putative kunitz-type invertase inhibitor . this protein was previously purified from the soluble tuber protein fraction and was shown to inhibit soluble tuber invertase in vitro <cit> . the role of invertase in cold sweetening of potato tubers has been characterized previously  <cit> . invertase enzymatic activity increased during cold storage, whereas an invertase inhibitory activity decreased, suggesting that invertase activity and thereby reducing sugar accumulation are regulated by a specific invertase inhibitor  <cit> . the negative correlation of kt-invinh protein abundance with tuber sugar content is consistent with this model. kt-invinh has no sequence similarity with other cloned invertase inhibitors of tobacco and potato  <cit> .

association analysis of kt-invinh identified highly significant associations of nine snps and one indel with tuber starch content and starch yield but not with chip quality . interestingly, snp <dig>  was not associated with any trait. snp <dig> causes the change from valine  to methionine , which was characteristic for the kt-invinh protein  <cit> . the allele a <dig> had a frequency of 93% in the chips-all population and was therefore nearly fixed. this might explain the lack of association with chip quality. the associations observed at the kt-invinh locus might also result from linkage disequilibrium with other differentially expressed kunitz-type inhibitors that are physically linked to kt-invinh . alternatively, kt-invinh may target in vivo a protein, which regulates starch degradation. in this case kt-invinh allelic variants could have a causal effect on tuber starch content and starch yield.

the two additional inhibitors negatively correlated with rsc were a miraculin and a potato inhibitor  <dig> . similarly to miraculins, pin2s have not been considered as candidate genes in the context of starch-sugar interconversion. as correlations between two variables do not provide conclusive evidence for a causal relationship between them, the effect of protease inhibitors on sugar accumulation may be direct or indirect.

proteins differentially expressed between genotype pools cis-t and cis-s
fifty protein spots differed qualitatively or quantitatively between ten genotypes accumulating either low  or high reducing sugar levels  before and during cold treatment. due to high sequence similarity between the members of some gene families, an unambiguous locus could not be assigned to all protein spots. different spots matching to the same protein accession can be allelic variants of the same gene. alternatively, spots derived from different genes can match to the same protein accession due to limited resolution of the protein databases. among the annotated spots were isoforms of the most abundant tuber proteins patatin and protease inhibitors   <cit> . thirteen differentially expressed proteins were kunitz-type protease inhibitors  or potato inhibitors  <dig> . kpis and pin2s are encoded by multi-gene families organized in mixed clusters at the stki locus on potato chromosome iii  <cit> . several studies have demonstrated high sequence variability and genotype specific variants among potato protease inhibitors  <cit> . the structural variation may indicate functional variation. apart from proteases, enzymes like invertase and amylase were inhibited by pis  <cit> . the genotype dependent, and in some cases cold induced or repressed expression suggests a regulatory role of several pis in starch-sugar interconversion.

remarkable differences between cis-t and cis-s genotypes were detected for patatin and phospholipase a <dig>  isoforms. the role of patatin in potato tubers has been described as storage proteins that serve as nitrogen source for sprouting and early plant growth. the in vitro lipid acyl hydrolase  and phospholipase activity of patatin and related proteins of other plants suggest additional functions  <cit> . phospholipases are involved in phospholipid and galactolipid degradation leading to changes in membrane composition and properties during cold acclimation  <cit> . increased membrane fluidity will lower the threshold temperature for membrane damage and will maintain activity of membrane associated proteins. such a role of patatins and phospholipase a <dig> in altering membrane lipid composition could explain differences between genotypes with strong  and weak  cold acclimation responses.

lipoxygenase  is a dioxygenase which catalyses the hydroperoxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. the lox that was differentially expressed between genotype pools cis-t and cis-s corresponded to a 9-lox. 9-lox oxidizes preferentially linoleic acid to 9-hydroperoxy linoleic acid, which is the predominant hydroperoxide isoform in potato tubers  <cit> . metabolites generated by 9-lox were involved in tuber development. suppression of 9-lox activity in tubers correlated with reduced tuber yield, decreased tuber size and a disruption of tuber formation  <cit> . the role of 9-lox in dormant potato tubers is unclear. several studies investigated lox activity in potato tubers during cold sweetening  <cit> . lox was supposed to contribute to peroxidative damage occurring during cold storage. however, there was no clear correlation between cold sweetening and membrane permeability or lipid saturation level  <cit> . furthermore, cold sweetening is a reversible process since sugar levels decrease when tubers are transferred back to higher temperatures, which is not in agreement with the irreversible peroxidation of membranes  <cit> . although speculative at this point, we propose that patatin, pla <dig> and lox isoforms modulate in a cultivar specific manner the properties of membranes, which leads to genotypic differences in cold acclimation and sweetening by yet unknown mechanisms.

the adaptation of tubers to low temperature might include other pathways besides starch-sugar interconversion and membrane composition. interesting candidates in this respect are the isoforms of a chloroplastic  leucine aminopeptidase  which were more abundant in cis-t than in cis-s genotypes. the corresponding locus on chromosome xii consists of duplicated, physically closely linked lap genes and is linked to qtl for tuber starch and sugar content. plant leucine aminopeptidases are involved in a wide range of physiological processes  <cit> . lapa was first identified in potato in response to wounding and is assumed to be unique for solanaceous plants  <cit> . lapa was induced by water deficit, salinity, pathogen attack and in response to jasmonic and abscisic acid  <cit> . the neutral lap  was constitutively expressed in various plant species and is assumed to play a role in general cell maintenance, whereas expression of acidic lap  was more specific  <cit> . our findings suggest a novel regulatory function of lapa in starch-sugar interconversion. stlapa, presumably located in amyloplasts, may inhibit starch degradation by proteolysis of active enzymes, thereby indirectly repressing sugar accumulation.

association analysis identified snp <dig> in the stlapn gene that was strongly associated with chip quality with and without cold storage, tuber starch content and starch yield. attempts to score snps directly in the differentially expressed stlapa gene failed due to the presence of insertion-deletion polymorphisms in the amplicons derived from highly heterozygous tetraploid individuals. since stlapn is separated from stlapa only by few kilobase pairs and since linkage disequilibrium  in potato can extend over several hundred kilobase pairs  <cit> , the association of snp <dig> with the tuber traits may be due to ld with stlapa. the average rsc of cultivars possessing the snp allele a <dig> was clearly lower than the average of cultivars lacking this allele throughout cold storage , which makes this snp an attractive marker for breeding applications.

differential spots were also assigned to proteins involved in metabolic processes like glycolysis or stress response. heat shock proteins involved in stress responses were more abundant exclusively in the cis-s genotypes. hsps are ubiquitous molecular chaperones which protect other proteins from missfolding after temperature stresses. accumulation of hsps in response to cold stress has been reported  <cit> . genotypic variation of hsps can therefore have consequences for several metabolic processes in potato tubers including cold sweetening.

reducing sugar levels and tuber bruising
intriguing overlaps were observed between the types of proteins that were differentially expressed in genotypes with high and low reducing sugar levels  and genotypes with high and low susceptibility to tuber bruising  <cit> . bruising describes the enzymatic discoloration of internal tuber tissue upon mechanical damage and seems biochemically unrelated with starch-sugar interconversion. in both studies however, protease inhibitors, patatins, lipoxygenase and phospholipase a <dig>  were independently identified as genotype dependent differential proteins. in the case of kunitz-type enzyme inhibitor s9c <dig>  lox and pla <dig>  the tryptic peptides matched unambiguously to the same loci , indicating that the differential proteins were products of the same genes, though the alleles associated with rsc and bruising susceptibility might not be the same. susceptibility to bruising is strongly correlated with higher tuber starch content, and membrane stability may also play a role  <cit> . this suggests tuber starch content and/or membrane structure as common denominators of sugar levels and bruising, which influence both rsc and bruising susceptibility. pis together with components of lipid metabolism and/or signaling might regulate both traits either directly or indirectly via regulation of tuber starch content or membrane composition.

CONCLUSIONS
the combination of proteomics and association genetics described in this paper provides an innovative route to better understand complex plant traits at the molecular level, particularly in non model plants such as the potato. comparative proteomics across a diversity panel enabled the identification of unapparent candidate genes not noticed in classical functional approaches, where protein abundance or activity in response to environmental changes is studied in a single genotype. association of dna polymorphisms in loci encoding differentially expressed proteins validated a role of leucine aminopeptidase in tuber starch content, starch yield and chip quality. lap has not been considered so far as acting in carbohydrate metabolism or cold induced sweetening. the snp’s associated with tuber quality can be used for marker-assisted selection of cis resistant cultivars.
