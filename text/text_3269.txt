BACKGROUND
camp-dependent protein kinase a  is a broad-specificity serine/threonine protein kinase that is ubiquitously distributed among tissue types, and identified in organisms from fungi to humans. inside cells, pka exists as a tetrameric protein composed of two catalytic subunits and a regulatory subunit dimer. the pka regulatory subunit  functions to maintain kinase inactivity in the absence of camp and form protein-protein interactions that compartmentalize the kinase. the selective sequestration or compartmentalization of intracellular pka has been supported by several studies showing that pka is concentrated in discrete intracellular locales by a-kinase anchoring proteins, or akaps
 <cit> . akaps bind to the regulatory  subunit dimer of the tetrameric pka holoenzyme at an antiparallel four-helix domain termed the dimerization and docking  domain
 <cit> . the akap-pka-r interaction functions to sequester pka in the vicinity of its phosphorylation substrates
 <cit>  and this selective concentration of pka activity in part, explains how multiple diverse extracellular stimuli can result in highly specific and discrete pka-mediated phosphorylation events
 <cit> .

originally named according to their apparent molecular weight, akaps are now designated by gene number . currently there are  <dig> annotated akaps . the pka-regulatory subunit binding domain of akaps is the most recognizable element among the otherwise structurally diverse protein family. akaps are classified according to binding specificity for the pka regulatory subunits; ri-, rii- or both ri and rii pka regulatory domains 
 <cit> . the primary structure  of the pkari/rii-binding domain is highly variable among akaps, though the secondary structure, which forms an amphipathic helix, contains several conserved hydrophobic residues that determine pka-r-subunit specificity and binding affinity
 <cit> . akaps also contain unique localization signal which are responsible for akap targeting to sub-cellular compartments, and in many cases, akaps also contain enzyme-binding sites that enable the formation of multi-protein signaling complexes
 <cit> . various akap targeting domains have been shown to interact with g-protein coupled receptors , adenylyl cyclases
 <cit> , exchange protein activated by camp , and phosphodiesterases 
 <cit> . hence, akaps function as signal processing hubs specifically linking upstream activation signals to downstream effector proteins.

akaps have been shown to regulate neuronal ion channels
 <cit> , memory and cognition
 <cit> , reproduction function
 <cit> , as well as renal
 <cit>  and cardiac function
 <cit> . one akap that has been identified in many tissues and a variety of cell signaling pathways is akap <dig> . splice variants of the akap <dig> gene  are dual-specificity akaps that have been extensively studied in central nervous system , striated muscle ion channel regulation
 <cit> , cardiac calcium cycling
 <cit> , and renal aquaporin transport
 <cit> .

akap7α, the first akap <dig> splice variant identified, is a membrane bound protein containing a lipid modification domain in the amino terminus
 <cit> . akap7α binds to l-type ca2+ channels where it regulates the pka-dependent phosphorylation of the ion channel
 <cit> . akap7α has also been shown to interact with sodium channels in the brain
 <cit> , and is required for feedback inhibition of the epithelial na+ channel 
 <cit> . akap7α-mediated pka anchoring to ion channels  provides a regulatory mechanism for channel function, whereby anchoring of pka regulates the phosphorylation state of the ion channel and has a profound effect on channel “open probability” and ion movement
 <cit> . another extensively studied akap <dig> splice variant is akap7δ, which was originally identified in rat kidney
 <cit> . in rat renal principle cells, the apak7δ splice variant functions to anchor pka to intracellular vesicles containing the aquaporin water channel and is required for aquaporin fusion to the plasma membrane
 <cit> . also in rats, akap7δ has been identified in the cardiac sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum atpase  where it regulates pka phosphorylation of a serca negative regulatory protein, phospholamban  and controls ca2+ re-uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum 
 <cit> . akap7δ has become a prime example for the pharmacological potential of pka-akap disruptor molecules, particularly in the treatment of human heart failure
 <cit> . much less is known about the akap7β and γ splice variants. akap7β differs from akap7α by the inclusion of a third exon which imparts a unique membrane localization that differs from that found for akap7α
 <cit> . akap7γ has been cloned from human pancreas
 <cit>  and mouse oocytes
 <cit> , though the functional significance of this splice variant remains relatively unknown.

though appreciation for the importance of akaps in cell signaling has grown exponentially in recent years, an analysis of the evolution and development of an akap remains absent. this study addresses several key questions in the molecular evolution of akap <dig> proteins including; 1) evolution/genesis of the akap <dig> ri/rii binding domain in relation to the pka-r d/d domains 2) evolution of the akap <dig> gene structure 3) species analyses of akap <dig> splice variants, 4) sequence determination of previously un-reported mouse and human akap7δ and 5) evolutionary conservation of key protein regions in short akap <dig> splice variants and rapid change in akap <dig> long form splice variants.

RESULTS
evolution of akap <dig> and pka-r interaction motifs
the akap <dig> protein domain required for pka-r binding  is detected in transcripts of species from zebrafish to humans . the 3’ terminal exon encoding the akap <dig> ri/rii binding domain first appears in the akap <dig> gene of lamprey and is conserved throughout vertebrates, placing akap <dig> binding domain genesis at the base of the vertebrate lineage . transcripts containing  the akap7ri/rii binding domain were not identified in drosophila and ciona, though transcripts containing high sequence identity to the akap- <dig> nls were identified . akap7-like genes were also identified in strongylocentrotus purpuratus , chlorella variabilis, and daphnia pulex . the resultant putative protein products of these akap7-like genes lack the akap7ri/ rii binding domain and likely the pka binding functionality of derived akaps.
 <cit>  are indicated by . the spacer region between helices in pka-riiα is indicated by a dotted line.

the pka-r subunit protein domain necessary for akap interaction  is conserved in the pka-r subunits of insects, urochordates, chordates, and vertebrates . specifically, the residues necessary for pka-r/akap <dig> interaction
 <cit>  are conserved in all species examined . appearance of the akap <dig> ri/rii binding domain corresponds with the vertebrate specific pka-r gene duplication .

akap <dig> splice variant evolution
akap <dig> gene structure, exon numbers and orientation were determined for multiple species . akap7α coding sequence in the akap <dig> gene and est transcript evidence first appears in basal teleosts , and is conserved from teleosts to humans . akap7β ests are only identified in mammals , though the akap7β-specific gene coding region is detectable from marsupials to mammals . akap7δ is the most recent akap <dig> splice variant, with est evidence supporting transcript presence in rats through humans. however exon data suggests this splice variant is absent from akap <dig> genes in species below laurasiatherian mammals . akap7δ is formed by the incorporation of a 19-nucleotide exon located between 7- and 10kb upstream of the putative akap7γ 5’ exon from cow to human . the appearance  of the akap7δ splice variant coincides with the loss of expression for akap7γ in both rat and marmoset  est databases, as well as the integration of a smaller akap7γ 5’ exon in the mouse transcript which results in a truncated akap7γ amino terminus unique to mouse .

the sequencing of human and mouse akap7δ and alignment with rat akap7δ validates the presence of the multiple nucleotide mutations resulting in the truncation of akap7γ in mice and loss of akap7γ in rats . mouse akap7δ has a 79% nucleotide sequence identity compared to human akap7δ , and rat akap7δ has 78% nucleotide sequence identity to human akap7δ. both rat and mouse akap7δ splice variants contain an “rgd” amino acid sequence that is absent in human akap7δ .

replacement of akap7γ with akap7δ indicates similar function
multiple sequence nucleotide alignments identified mutations in the akap <dig> genes of rat, mouse, and marmoset which result in the loss of  or truncation of  the akap7γ splice variant and incorporation of the akap7δ splice variant . in the rat akap <dig> gene, the putative akap7γ initiation codon contains two nucleotide mutations where “atg” in the kozak sequence is mutated to “ggg”, the result of a transition at position  <dig> of the codon , and a transversion at position  <dig> of the codon  yielding the missense mutation met → gly. in the mouse akap <dig> gene, a cognate mutation was also identified in the putative akap7γ initiation codon as a single transition at nucleotide position  <dig>  replaces the akap7γ start codon with “gtg”, resulting in the missense mutation met → val. also identified in the mouse akap <dig> gene, a second mutation downstream of the akap7γ initiation codon results in the formation of an internal start site where an “atg” is formed as the result of a nucleotide transversion , yielding the amino acid leu → met mutation which yields a truncated akap7γ splice variant in mouse . the akap7γ mutations in the rodent lineage seem to be specific to rats and mice, as another rodent  lacks these mutations, and also altogether lacks the akap7δ 5’ exon . the loss of akap7γ is also evident in marmoset, as “atg” is replaced by “ata”, the result of a transition at position  <dig> of the initiation codon  replacing met with ile.

two-dimensional western analysis of recombinant rat and mouse akap <dig> long-form splice variants confirms the loss of akap7γ in rats, and shows that both akap7δ and akap7γ are produced from akap7δ cdna from mice . it is also apparent that mouse akap7γ is the major product from akap7δ cdna , which is likely the result of an akap7γ internal translational start site that is present in mice, but absent in rats . akap <dig> immunoprecipitations  identified akap7δ and a variant of akap7δ  in rat heart, while akap7δ, akap7γ, and unknown variants were seen from mouse heart ips . comparison of rat and mouse akap <dig> cardiac localization by immunofluorescence  shows identical localization compared between rat  and mouse . the pattern of akap <dig> cardiac immunstaining in rat and mouse is consistent with localization to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, as previously reported for akap7δ in rat
 <cit> .

insertion-deletions in human and rat akap7δ yield novel splice variants
sequencing of human akap7δ identified splice variants containing nucleotide sequence insertions and deletions . human akap7δ variant- <dig>  contains a seventy five nucleotide insertion between the first and second exons of akap7δ , and an exon deletion . akap7δ variant- <dig> contains two insertions; a sixty nine-nucleotide insertion between akap7δ exons  <dig> and  <dig>  and a sixty nine nucleotide insertion between akap7δ exons  <dig> and  <dig> . the upstream insertion sequence in akap7δ variant- <dig> has 100 % sequence identity to a region in the human akap <dig> gene  between the akap7δ 5’ exon and akap7δ exon  <dig>  the upstream insertion sequence in variant- <dig> has 96% sequence identity to the human akap <dig> gene. the downstream insertion sequence in akap7δ variant- <dig> has 100% sequence identity to the akap7β-specific sequence. pcr amplification of the human akap7δ indel regions show the 5’ insertion is predominant relative to the native form, while the deletion-variant is less prominent than the native transcript form . the akap7δ splice variant containing the akap7β exon is a minor product but is identified in most tissues .

open reading frame  analysis of human akap7δ transcript variants- <dig> and  <dig>  show that the akap7δ 5’ insertions shifts the reading frame downstream to begin initiation at the akap7γ coding region , while the downstream exon deletion seen in akap7δ variant- <dig> results in a truncated protein that contains the akap <dig> nuclear localization signal , but lacks the akap <dig> ri/rii binding domain . the open reading frame for akap7δ variant- <dig> begins at the akap7γ initiation codon and produces a protein containing the akap <dig> nls, akap <dig> ri/rii binding domain and the akap7β protein region .

two exon-deletion transcript variants were also identified in rat akap7δ . akap7δ variant- <dig> contains deletions at exons 3– <dig>  while variant- <dig> contains a deletion of exon  <dig>  of these variants, only rat akap7δ variant- <dig> contains the akap <dig> ri/rii binding domain. no indels were detected from sequencing mouse akap7δ, however a short  akap7γ splice variant was detected in mouse ests , and is marginally expressed in mouse spleen .

conservation in akap <dig> short splice variants
akap <dig> short splice variants  have pronounced sequence conservation across the vertebrate phyla. nucleotide sequence alignments of the akap <dig> α/β 5’ exon show that this exon is highly conserved from zebrafish to humans , as the nucleotide sequence homology for this exon ranges from  <dig> to 98 % identity. amino acid alignment of the akap7α/β amino terminus  shows this protein region has a sequence homology of  <dig> to 100% from zebrafish to humans.

akap7β is distinguished from akap7α by the inclusion of a 69-nucleotide exon between the akap <dig> α/β 5’ exon and the akap <dig> 3’ terminal exon. this akap7β-specific exon is found in the genomes of several mammals , and is highly conserved . amino acid alignment of the akap7β-specific protein region shows sequence homology of  <dig> to 95% from pigs to human .

tissue expression of akap <dig> splice variants in rodents and humans
akap7δ is ubiquitously expressed in human, mouse and rat tissues . akap7α expression is expressed in several rodent and human tissues, with conserved expression seen between rat, mouse and human heart, kidney, brain, liver and lung . akap7β mrna expression is also detected in multiple tissues in rodent and human, though conserved expression between rodents and humans is only seen in the kidney, with the predominant akap7β expression site is the pancreas in humans .

discussion
in this study we have provided the first evolutionary analysis of an akap. the significance of pka signaling has been shown throughout eukaryotic organisms. here, we show the akap <dig> ri/rii binding domain appears in basal vertebrates, corresponding to a pka-r subunit gene duplication event. in the molecular evolution of the akap <dig> gene, akap <dig> short splice variants appeared early in the vertebrate lineage and have remained highly conserved. in the akap <dig> long form splice variants, multiple nucleotide mutations and insertions-deletions have resulted in the concurrent loss of akap7γ and formation of akap7δ in rats. specifically in rats, the replacement of akap7γ with akap7δ, as shown in this study, has likely lead to an over-statement of the significance of akap7δ in species other than rat
 <cit> . evolutionary pressures in the form of nucleotide insertions and mutations in the human akap7δ coding sequence have likely driven preference for akap7γ production in humans. hence, it is likely that akap7δ is of minimal significance in human akap7-mediated pka signaling.

integration of the akap7-ri/rii binding domain and pka-r dimerization/docking domain in vertebrate evolution
while akap7-like proteins were identified in invertebrate and chordate species, the appearance of the ri/rii binding domain  occurs in basal vertebrates . the formation of akap <dig> proteins from akap7-like proteins corresponds with pka-r gene duplication events where the pka-ri gene duplicates to form pka-riα and pka-riβ, and pka-rii forms pka-riiα and pka-riiβ. evolution of the pka-r subunits has been previously described
 <cit> . here we provide greater resolution of the timing of pka-r gene duplications, and show that the amino acid sequences of pka-r d/d domains are highly conserved, even prior to the gene duplication events. the relative fixation of pka-r d/d sequences prior to and following the appearance of the akap <dig> ri/rii binding domain suggests that akap <dig> evolved subsequent to the increased presence of pka . this is supported by the relatively rapid development of the akap <dig> ri/rii binding domain which is absent in chordates , but present in vertebrates .

origin of akap7δ, the need for an akap <dig> long-form splice variant
as seen in our akap <dig> gene and splice variant phylogenetic analyses, akap7γ is the ancestral akap <dig> long form splice variant in mammals. several nucleotide mutations identified in the murine lineage  resulted in the loss of akap7γ through mis-sense mutations in the translational start codon. the most dramatic of these mutations occurs in rats, where the akap7γ initiation codon contains a successive transition and rare transversion that results in glycine replacing methionine. the results of these mutations have been confirmed in ncbi database searches, as rat akap7γ has been removed from the database , mouse akap7γ is truncated  and marmoset est search results show akap7γ is not present whereas akap7δ is expressed . the combination of the akap7γ initiation codon loss combined with the concurrent absence of a downstream initiation codon utilized in mice , likely yielded the evolutionary pressure for the incorporation of the akap7δ 5’ exon in rats.

in vitro analyses of mouse akap7γ, akap7δ and rat akap7δ show that both γ and δ splice variants are produced from the mouse akap7δ transcript, suggesting that akapγ is an internal translational start site product of akap7δ production. this is consistent with our akap <dig> gene analysis and provides a different model for akap <dig> long form splice variants than have been previously reported
 <cit> . our results also suggest that akap7γ is the major product of akap7δ transcription and translation. in rats, only a single protein product was identified from recombinant akap7δ expression which is consistent with gene and est alignments showing the loss of akap7γ in rats. findings from previous studies that have addressed akap7γ synthesis and function in rats
 <cit>  should be solely attributed to akap7δ as the akap7γ splice variant is absent in rats. the significant role of akap7δ in the renal aquaporin shuttle
 <cit> , and regulation of cardiac ca2+ cycling
 <cit>  has led to a concerted effort to develop akap7δ peptidomimetics for use in treating human heart failure
 <cit> . results from this study show that akap7δ is the sole akap <dig> long form splice variant found in rats, and the significance of this splice variant is very likely over-stated. combined with the identification of nucleotide insertions in the 5’ end of human akap7δ that would exclusively promote the production of akap7γ in all tissues, the evidence presented here indicates that the functional significance of akap7δ is minimal in species other than rats. in mice, where akap7γ appears to be the dominant product of akap7δ transcription and translation, cardiac akap <dig> immunlocalization is consistent with the sr indicating akap7γ largely replaces akap7δ at the sr in species other than rat and supports the possibility that akap7δ and akap7γ are functionally redundant in mice. further studies are required to determine the functional consequences and distinction between akap7δ and akap7γ in mice and human skeletal muscle.

evolutionary pressure for replacing akap7δ with akap7γ
akap7δ has been identified as a vital component in cardiac ca2+ handling at the sarcoplasmic reticulum in rats
 <cit>  and has been proposed as a pharmacological target in treating heart failure
 <cit> . our evolutionary analysis of the akap <dig> gene has shown that the origin of akap7δ was brought about through a series of nucleotide mutations in the akap7γ coding sequence in rats, hence likely leading to exaggeration of the functional significance of akap7δ. this is supported by in vitro analysis of mouse akap7δ, where akap7γ  is the major product. akap <dig> immunoprecipitations from rat and mouse heart tissue also show akap7δ and an akap7δ variant in rat while in mouse heart akap7δ is a minor product and akap7γ is prominent. furthermore, sequencing of human akap7δ  showed the dominant presence  of a nucleotide sequence insertion immediately downstream of the akap7δ 5’ codon, resulting in a reading-frame shift that promotes the production of akap7γ. therefore akapγ is the predominant, functional akap <dig> long form splice variant in humans and pharmacological efforts in designing akap7δ disruptor peptides should instead be directed at akapγ.

akap <dig> short form splice variant evolution
found only in the vertebrate lineage, akap7α is the ancestral akap <dig> splice variant and has conserved tissue expression in rodents and human heart, kidney, brain, liver and lung. akap7α has been extensively studied in the heart and brain, where this protein regulates pka localization to  ion channels such as the l-type ca2+ channel
 <cit>  and epithelial na+ channels
 <cit> . deletion of a specific region in the cardiac voltage-sensitive ca2+ channel abolishes akap <dig> binding leading to cardiac hypertrophy and premature death in mice, and demonstrates the importance of akap7α mediated pka signaling in adrenergic stimulation
 <cit> . as seen in the expression results in this study, it is also likely that akap7α has a conserved role in ion channel regulation in kidney, liver and lung. akap7α amino-terminal amino acids that have been previously identified
 <cit>  in membrane targeting through myristolation  or palmitoylation  are absolutely conserved from zebrafish to humans. furthermore, hydrophobic residues  in the akap7α amino terminus which are likely to be critical for membrane localization are also conserved between zebrafish and humans. given the high degree of sequence conservation in the akap7α amino terminus, it is likely this protein functions in membrane ion channel regulation throughout vertebrate species following the divergence of lamprey.

development of the akap7β exon occurred in mammals , and while akap7β and α splice variants share the same amino terminus, the akap7β-specific exon confers a cellular localization distinct from the akap7α splice variant
 <cit> . the functional significance of the akap7β splice variant in mammals remains unknown, though the sequence conservation in this protein is certainly suggestive of its importance. akap7β is primarily conserved in the kidney of rodents and human, and it seems likely that this splice variant has a conserved function in renal ion channel regulation. importantly, in this study we have identified a novel akap <dig> long-form splice variant containing the β-exon. further studies are required to address the unique membrane-localizing function of this akap <dig> protein region.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that the formation of akap <dig> proteins occurred in basal vertebrate species, likely in response to the increased presence and distribution of intracellular pka following pka-r gene duplication events. short form splice variants from akap <dig> genes have remained highly conserved across species, while long forms have undergone rapid evolutionary change. independent mutations in the akap <dig> genes of rats, mice and marmoset have resulted in loss or truncation of akap7γ and a likely compensatory incorporation of akap7δ. these results suggest that studies of akap7δ are not necessarily comparable among rats, mice and humans. the specific targeting of human akap7δ in pharmaco-therapeutics should be undertaken with caution, as this splice variant is largely absent in humans.
