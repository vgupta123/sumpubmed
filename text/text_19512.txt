BACKGROUND
meiosis is essential for eukaryotic sexual reproduction and reduces the number of chromosomes in half to generate haploid cells  <cit> . to ensure the proper meiotic homolog segregation, the homologs must recognize and pair with each other in early prophase i  <cit> . it is thought that a key pairing mechanism is via dna heteroduplex formation, which is intimately coupled with the initiation of meiotic recombination  <cit> . one major type of outcome of meiotic recombination is crossover , which involves the exchange of flanking markers, as well as possible gene conversion   <cit> . another result of recombination is gc without exchange of flanking markers   <cit> . meiosis is also the process that re-distributes the genetic variations in a eukaryotic population. the extent of meiotic recombination directly impacts the frequency of specific combinations of alleles. because of the effect of meiotic recombination on the distribution of genetic diversity, meiosis is thought to have contributed to the extraordinary diversity and evolutionary success of eukaryotes  <cit> .

meiotic recombination has been studied extensively using model systems, including the budding and fission yeasts, drosophila melanogaster, caenorhabditis elegans, mammals, arabidopsis thaliana, and maize  <cit> . in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, molecular and biochemical studies have identified key intermediates of meiotic recombination, starting with dna double strand breaks  and d-loops  <cit> . a portion of the d-loops proceeds to form double holliday junctions , which are then resolved largely to cos. some d-loops undertake another pathway to form cos, possibly via single holliday junctions , as seen in the fission yeast  <cit> . a third option for the d-loops is the repair of dsbs without cos, resulting nco/gc events if the two recombining dnas are not identical.

because recombination occurs at many sites in the genome, it is important to investigate recombination at the whole-genome level. genome-wide genetic detection of crossovers has been done in many genetic systems, resulting in the construction of genetic maps, as well as producing other information. however, previous molecular studies usually relied on the use of naturally occurring  and artificially generated  recombination hotspots as substrates; therefore, the molecular details of crossovers are not available on a genome-wide level. in addition, nco/gc has been investigated using a small number of markers or by inference at a population level. recently, meiosis between two strains of the budding yeast has been analyzed using microarrays, providing valuable information on the frequency of co and nco events on a genome-wide scale  <cit> .

as an alternative way to analyze meiotic recombination at the dna level on a whole-genome scale, we have used the recently developed roche gs20/flx  <cit>  and illumina  <cit>  sequencing technologies. to obtain a large number of dna polymorphisms as markers for recombination, we used two strains of s. cerevisiae that have sequenced genomes: s288c and rm11-1a  <cit> , which were estimated to have  <dig> -1% sequence divergence distributed throughout the genome. here we report our results from high-throughput sequencing of both the s288c and rm11-1a  strains and four meiotic products. over  <dig> thousand single nucleotide polymorphisms  were revealed by comparison and further parsing of the two genomic sequences. armed with these markers, we were able to detect cos, ncos and other recombination events in meiotic products  from a diploid generated by crossing s288c with rm <dig> 

RESULTS
resequencing of the s288c and rm <dig> strains identified errors in reported sequences
we compared the s288c and rm <dig> genomic sequences and recognized  <dig>  putative snps; however, our preliminary analysis by sequencing pcr products using the conventional dideoxynucleotide method indicated that  <dig> putative snps were actually sequencing errors in the s288c or rm <dig> sequences . therefore, we re-sequenced the s288c  and rm <dig>  genomic dnas using the illumina technology and obtained >  <dig>  and  <dig>  million reads, respectively . these reads covered 94% and 93% percent of the respectively public genomic sequences and provided independent verification of  <dig>  snps  that were previously detected by the public sequences. in addition, we found  <dig> and  <dig> errors  in the public s288c and rm <dig> sequences, respectively , corresponding to previously identified snps between these sequences. because the s288c strain is slightly different to rm <dig> , the vast majority of the public sequences are identical. the sequences that agree between the two strains should be more reliable because they are supported by both sequencing projects. however, there is a very low probability that a small number of bases might be wrong. therefore, we also compared the sequences that are in agreement between s288c and rm <dig> with our new data. using our data with consistent results from at least  <dig> reads, we found indeed there were only a very small number of errors,  <dig> and  <dig> in the previously reported s288c and rm <dig> sequences, respectively, resulting in the identification of  <dig> new snps . our data provide strong support for over  <dig> thousand snps, which will facilitate further molecular genetic and genomic studies using these two yeast strains.

sequencing of meiotic products by  <dig> provided a test for de novo assembly of new sequencing reads
to obtain a diploid with a large number of sequence polymorphisms, we crossed s288c with rm11; then we induced meiosis in the diploid using a standard protocol, and obtained a number of tetrads  with meiotic spores . we cultured one set of four spores in a rich medium and isolated dnas from these four cultures. these dnas were sequenced using the  <dig> technology, resulting in approximately  <dig>  to  <dig>  reads, or  <dig> × to  <dig> × coverage, of each of the four meiotic products .

because the  <dig> sequences are relatively long, ranging from ~ <dig> to >  <dig> bps, we thought it would be informative to assess the feasibility of performing assembly of the new sequence data as a strategy for de novo sequencing of genomes. we assembled the  <dig> reads from our four meiotic samples separately to test the effect of read length on assembly since the sequences from spore  <dig> had only shorter reads of ~ <dig> bases, whereas the sequences of the other meiotic products had longer reads. we found that the assembly of data from any of the first three spores with longer reads gave much longer contigs  and a higher coverage than the short reads from spore  <dig>  using the s288c genome as a reference . next, we pooled the data from two, three or four spores, and performed assembly again; we found that the data from any two of the first three spores allowed the assembly of much larger contigs and greater coverage of the genome than data from single spores . with the combination of data of the first three spores, the assembly yielded longer contigs, but little increase in the coverage of the genome. the addition of the short reads from spore  <dig> primarily resulted in many more short contigs. these results indicated that ~10× coverage from the longer  <dig> reads provided > 94% coverage of the yeast genome.

software newbler  was used for assembly of different datasets. contigs homologous to mitochondrial sequence of s288c were removed before further analysis.

analysis of snps in the meiotic sequence data revealed  <dig> cos with and without gcs
using the >  <dig> thousand snp markers that we have verified, we determined chromosomal regions that are primarily of the s288c or rm <dig> strain backgrounds, respectively , resulting in the identification of  <dig> cos  . as shown in figure 1a, each of the  <dig> yeast chromosomes had  <dig> to  <dig> cos, with larger chromosomes having more cos than smaller chromosomes. this observation is well supported by a recent study  <cit>  based on  <dig> cos resulted from  <dig> meiosis , in which co number is substantially linear proportional to chromosome size . in addition, the genotypes of the four meiotic products indicated that the four meiotic chromatids had participated in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> cos, respectively. among the  <dig> co events,  <dig> did not show a detectable gc ,  <dig> were associated with a single detected gc ,  <dig> associated with two gcs , the remaining  <dig> had a complex gc pattern . three cos even had sequence changes in  <dig> of the four meiotic products. a subset of cos was verified by pcr and the results  agreed with the high-throughput sequencing results.

comparison of meiotic sequences uncovered  <dig> ncos/gcs
in addition, by comparing sequences from all four meiotic products, we detected  <dig> putative gc events not associated with co . to verify its reliability, we analyzed the dna sequences at all  <dig> putative gc sites using pcr and conventional sanger dna sequencing. the pcr and sequencing results were in complete agreement with the roche gs20/flx and illumina results. the results indicated that the four meiotic chromatids had  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> detected gcs. because the two yeast genomes are ~99% identical, the observed gc events were likely fewer than the actual recombination/pairing events. we estimated the possible number of undetected ncos in a way similar to that in a recent study  <cit> . among  <dig> cos discovered in this analysis,  <dig> were detected using flanking snp information, but did not show a detectable gc due to the lack of a snp. if a similar fraction  of ncos was not detected due to the lack of snps, the estimated total amount of ncos would be  <dig> . therefore, our genome sequencing results indicated that there were a significant number of nco  events, resulting in a change of allelic frequency.

the dna of spore  <dig> was analyzed earlier than others and the  <dig> reads had shorter lengths, resulting in a reduced coverage of the snps. one effect of the reduced coverage was that a crossover involving spore  <dig> probably had more inaccurate border; nevertheless, all cos involving spore  <dig> were still detectable because flanking markers were still observed. because ncos were detected using the snp information for each spore in the chromosomal context, reduced snp coverage in spore  <dig> likely caused a decrease in nco detection, providing another possible explanation for under-estimation of the nco number.

size range and map position of cos and ncos
from the sequence information, we estimated the minimum and maximum sizes of the cos, as illustrated in the example shown in figure 1b. the maximum possible lengths of crossover regions  ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig>  bp. as this could be an over-estimation due to the limited snp information, we also estimated the minimum size, as defined by the detected snps within the co regions; as often there was only one snp in the co region, the minimum sizes for these were as small as one base pair. therefore, median sizes of cos, estimated by the average value of their minimum and maximum sizes, were used for statistical analysis . a histogram for over  <dig> cos detected from  <dig> meiosis from a recent study  <cit>  is shown in figure 2b as a comparison . distribution of distance between adjacent cos are displayed in figure 2c and 2d for both  <dig> cos in this analysis and that from the recent study  <cit> .

nevertheless, at least  <dig> cos had minimal sizes of greater than  <dig>  kb, with the largest minimum size being over  <dig> kb . among the ncos, the maximum sizes ranged from  <dig>  bp to  <dig>  bp, and the largest minimum size was over  <dig>  kb . these results indicate that both co and nco can involve several kbs, suggesting that dna repair and/or heteroduplex formation can be rather extensive. in budding yeast, most cos are thought to result from the double holliday junctions , and a small fraction of cos from single holliday junctions   <cit> . if all dhj are initiated with the same size and then each holliday junction "randomly" expands to a larger size, the length distribution of cos should follow a normal distribution. however, we found that the observed sizes of cos  were not consistent with a normal distribution, supporting a mixture of cos resulted from both dhjs and shjs, since cos from shjs might have different ranges of lengths resulted from a different pathway  <cit> . this distribution is also supported by the same analysis on the data of the recent study using microarrays   <cit> .

a recent study mapped  <dig>  dsb hot-spots along the chromosomes of a dmc <dig> mutant  <cit> . to test whether the co and nco events were enriched for dsbs, we obtained the dsb density data  <cit>  in a region from 10-kb upstream to 10-kb downstream of each co, and calculated the average dsb density in 1-kb intervals centered at every kb in this 20-kb region for the co and nco sets in our study, and found that the peak of highest average dsb density was very close to the site of co or nco . we also performed a similar analysis for the co and nco loci reported by mancera et al.  <cit> , and found very similar patterns . these findings indicated that the loci of cos and ncos were enriched for dsb hot-spots, consistent with the idea that dsbs are initiation sites of meiotic recombination.

in yeast, genetic studies indicated that cos might be distributed according to two models: poisson and counting models for interference insensitive and sensitive cos, respectively  <cit> . we found that the observed cos  did not agree with a poisson model. further analysis indicates that the distribution of cos is consistent with a mixture of interference insensitive and sensitive events . in the budding yeast, plants, and human, interference-sensitive cos are the majority, accounting for about 80% of the total co events, with the remaining cos being interference insensitive  <cit> . molecular genetic studies indicate that interference-sensitive cos are generated from the dhj intermediates, and involve branch migration, resulting in potentially longer tracks of conversion  <cit> . in the fission yeast, the interference insensitive pathway has been reported to go through a shj intermediate, having a distinct mechanism  <cit> , although the mechanisms for interference insensitive cos in other organisms are not clear.

the maximum possible lengths of co regions in this study covered a wide range. if interference insensitive cos in the budding yeast also involve a shj, it is possible that shorter cos might be generated by the interference insensitive pathway. to test this idea, we analyzed the genomic distribution of the cos that were shorter than  <dig>  kb, and found them to be consistent with a poisson distribution ; on the other hand, the cos that were longer than  <dig>  kb did not have a poisson distribution, consistent with the possibility that they were generated by the interference-sensitive pathway . analyses with different cutoffs other than  <dig>  kb were also preformed , but the statistical fit of the distribution of shorter cos to a poisson model was not as good as that of the  <dig>  kb cutoff; in addition, the proportion of shorter cos from the  <dig>  kb cutoff was consistent with previous observations  <cit> .

grieg et al.  <cit>  reported that sequence divergence between homologs could affect the frequency and distribution of cos. to test whether the sequence differences between s288c and rm <dig> had an effect on co and nco frequency, we divided the yeast genome into 10-kb intervals, and determined the distribution of numbers of snps in 10-kb intervals throughout the genome. we then obtained the positions of the cos and ncos from mancera et al.  <cit> , and plotted the average number of cos  as a function of the number of snps/10-kb . our analysis showed that the regions with more snps did not have a reduced frequency of cos or ncos. therefore, the extent of divergence between the s288c and rm <dig> strains did not seem to adversely affect co frequencies.

sequence data revealed complex co and post-meiotic segregation events
as mentioned above, several cos have complex gc patterns , consistent with the repair of heteroduplex dna after holliday junction formation and resolution. in addition, we also found that three co events had sequence alterations in three of the four meiotic products   <cit> . further analysis of these three events using pcr and sequencing showed that they indeed involved three chromatids , suggesting that dsbs were generated in two chromatids, and that the recombinogenic broken ends from the dsbs interacted with the other two chromatids during the recombination process, in four-chromatid events. in addition, we observed one region that had two adjacent gc regions without exchange of flanking sequences ; this could most easily be explained by the resolution of a dhj in a nco fashion  <cit> . although, this was proposed in the original dsb repair model of recombination as a major pathway for ncos, more recent models favor a non-holliday junction pathway for ncos. our results suggested that dhjs might still be revolved to form ncos, although at a frequency much lower than that of co formation. we have also detected some evidence of post-meiotic segregation , which was an indication of unrepaired heteroduplexes that subsequently segregated during mitotic growth of the haploid meiotic products . from the high-throughput reads, we found one putative pms events and another  <dig> pms candidates with low quality from initial mapping. sequence analysis of pcr products confirmed the pms event and the other candidates were denied due to mis-alignment of repeat sequences.

a major difference between this study and the microarray studies published recently  <cit>  is that we determined the actual sequences of the meiotic products, rather than inferring about the snp genotypes on the basis of differential hybridization signals. our approach can detect both snps and any other sequence information. it was reported that spontaneous mutation rates at specific loci could be 6- <dig> fold higher in meiosis than mitosis  <cit> . however, there has been no study of mutations during meiosis at a genome-wide scale. to search for spontaneous mutations, we examined the sequences throughout the genome for base substitution mutations and did not identify any sequences that differed from both parental sequences. therefore, the mutation rate was below our detection limit of ~ <dig> × 10- <dig> per base per cell division. a recent genome-wide analysis of mitotic yeast cells provided an estimated rate of mitotic substitution of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per base per cell division  <cit> , suggesting that a 6- <dig> fold increase would not be detected by our analysis. tandem repetitive sequences are known to have high mutation rates to form different copy numbers in cell division. repeats with a higher copy number usually have higher mutation rates and lower appearance frequency   <cit> . however, the possibility of appearance of such kind of mutation is still too low to be observed in one generation of meiosis, as confirmed by our analysis of all  <dig> chromosomes in the  <dig> spores.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our studies have reliably verified over  <dig> thousand snps that were identified by comparison between the public s288c and rm <dig> genomic sequences and have uncovered errors in the s288c and rm <dig> sequences, respectively, thereby removing  <dig> previously reported snps and defining  <dig> new snps. these new sequence results are useful resources for further genomic and genetic studies using the budding yeast. we have uncovered detailed molecular information about meiotic recombination on a whole genome level using high-throughput sequencing. the numbers of co and nco events we detected were in very good agreement with previous studies; furthermore, we described complex patterns of cos that involved three chromatids, shedding new light on the process of meiotic recombination. our studies provide a window into the nature of meiotic recombination at the dna level throughout the genome and established a whole-genome foundation for further molecular genetic studies of this fundamental process.
