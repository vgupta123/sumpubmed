BACKGROUND
higher plants have complex sensory mechanisms to detect changes in the light environment  <cit> . there is evidence from physiological experiments that low levels of uv-b radiation  induce photomorphogenic responses in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit>  and other species  <cit> . results from studies of uv-b-induced photomorphogenesis  <cit>  and gene expression  <cit>  point to the existence of a complex web of interactions involving phytochromes and cryptochromes as a part of the underlying perception, regulation and/or signaling system  <cit> . however, several responses induced by low-dose uv-b appear to be to some extent independent of the photoreceptors that mediate responses to visible radiation  <cit> . cotyledon-opening under defined uv-b conditions is a key phenotype, as this morphological response is consistent with signalling through a photoreceptor  <cit> . fluence-response curves and the independence of the cotyledon-opening response from dna repair make this defined cotyledon-opening phenotype especially useful for genetic screens  <cit> .

screens for isolating mutants with altered sensitivity to uv-b in hypocotyls have been performed and led to the identification of uli <dig>  a uv-b hyposensitive mutant  <cit> , and uvr <dig>  a mutant hypersensitive to uv-b  <cit> . both mutants appear to be altered in uv-b-specific signaling pathways. photomorphogenic mutant analyses implicate the b-zip transcriptional factor hy <dig> as a component in the uv-b regulation of the expression of selected genes  <cit> , and the cop <dig> gene as a regulator of hy <dig> and additional gene expression under uv-b  <cit> . extensive analysis of uvr <dig> indicates that nuclear localization of the protein is important in uv-b signal transduction  <cit>  and that uvr <dig> and hy <dig> are part of the same signal transduction pathway for gene expression responses  <cit> .

genome scanning is another useful approach for the isolation of loci that encode components of uv-b perception and signalling mechanisms. genetic variability in wild ecotypes of a. thaliana provides an opportunity to discover genetic regions controlling phenotypic differences  <cit> . genetically complex or polygenic inheritance, quantitative measurement and the availability of dna markers allow access to quantitative trait loci   <cit> . qtl mapping studies delimit the chromosomal regions controlling quantitative traits, and in some cases allow the identification of new alleles or causal mutations  <cit> . in the arabidopsis model system qtl analysis has been performed with potentially adaptive traits like salt tolerance  <cit> , aluminium tolerance  <cit> , and powdery mildew disease resistance  <cit> , as well as with developmental or physiological traits such as seed size  <cit> , leaf architecture  <cit> , inflorescence development  <cit>  and growth rate  <cit> . it is possible to compare genetic architecture in different environments, including controlled treatment environments, although the power to detect loci will be less than the detection power for overall genetic effects  <cit> .

metabolic and signalling pathways can be identified from epistatic interactions  <cit> , and gene interactions are widespread and important in theory and in most data sets. epistatic interactions can explain substantial amount of variance  <cit> , although power to detect epistasis is low in most recombinant inbred  experiments with 100- <dig> lines. better understanding of the genetic architecture of uv-b responses will thus be achieved by incorporation of epistatic locus interactions into the analysis.

differences in phenotype measurements between individuals of the same ri genotype are due to random fluctuation and alleles genetically controlling stability  or variance   <cit> . arabidopsis loci for canalization of flowering and plant growth have been found previously, by qtl mapping of ri lines  <cit> . full understanding of phenotype and environmental constraints on phenotype expression require consideration of the stability of the phenotype as well as the extent of the effect of important alleles.

no qtl studies have been reported with uv-b-induced responses in arabidopsis. in rice sato et al.  <cit>  have reported three qtls controlling uv-b resistance, with a more precise mapping of the location of one of the reported qtls  <cit> . recombinant inbred lines, or in some species clones of f <dig> families, are the most useful for exploration of genotype and environment interactions, as the same genotype can be exposed to multiple environments  <cit> .

in the experiments described in this paper we used four sets of ri lines to perform a qtl analysis of uv-b-induced photomorphogenesis in arabidopsis. we measured cotyledon opening in de-etiolating seedlings as a model photomorphogenic response; under certain experimental conditions this response is induced by uv-b  and the induction mechanism for cotyledon opening does not appear to involve signals derived from uv-b-induced dna damage  <cit> . we used composite interval mapping to locate additive, uv-b-specific and epistatic qtl, by incorporating all the data including replicates and multiple 'environments', which in this case are uv-b treatment and control  growth conditions. we also analyzed these data with a straightforward single-marker method to select the most robust loci for candidate gene hypothesis testing. loci for cotyledon-opening stability were identified; these include loci at the same position as the cotyledon opening qtl and new loci that regulate stability but not extent of cotyledon opening. we combined our qtl with information from the literature to produce a list of candidate genes for further testing. mutations in our top candidate gene, hy <dig>  were defective in uv-b-induced cotyledon opening.

RESULTS
cotyledon opening in arabidopsis was induced specifically by low levels of uv-b, and not by control irradiations without uv-b, as illustrated in fig.  <dig>  cotyledon-opening angle is a uv-b-photoreceptor-induced response  <cit> , and was thus the phenotype used for our mapping experiments. the uv-b treatment was given to young dark-grown seedlings from the ri populations as a  <dig>  hr low-fluence pulse, as previously described for this uv-b-cotyledon-opening response  <cit> . statistical analysis of these +uv-b and -uv-b measurements allowed identification of a total of  <dig> loci, with  <dig> loci controlling cotyledon opening , four loci controlling uv-b-specific cotyledon opening, and three loci controlling the stability of cotyledon-opening.

chromosomal regions affecting cotyledon opening
a total of  <dig> separate loci that control cotyledon opening are significant at our stringent experiment-wise p <  <dig>  threshold . loci are identified by chromosome and map distance codes. details of the analysis, including estimated effect sizes for contrasting alleles, are given in additional file  <dig>  additional file  <dig>  additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  arranged by locus identification code. fifteen of these loci were also significant in the single-marker analysis. the amount of variance explained by difference in genotype differs in the four mapping populations, with lerxcol and lerxcvi having the highest heritabilities. marker spacing is most dense in lerxcol and lerxcvi, and most sparse in bayxsha. the combination of heritability of the trait, partition of the genome into larger numbers of ri lines, and the marker parameter space determines the power to detect loci  <cit> ; as expected, we detected the most loci in lerxcvi and bayxsha populations. new genotyping methods can locate all the recombination junctions in ri populations  <cit> , although the specific lines in our study have not yet been genotyped to this density.

comparison of epistatic interactions
gene interactions  are likely to be important in explaining genetic control of phenotypic traits; however, these interactions are difficult to detect  <cit> . we scanned for interactions between two loci, whether or not those loci had an effect on cotyledon opening considered singly. significant two-locus epistatic interactions were detected in the bayxsha , colxkas  and lerxcvi  populations. larger mapping populations are needed for detection of multiple loci by interval mapping methods  <cit> , and these are the larger mapping populations in our study. in bayxsha and lerxcvi the epistatic interactions had lower heritability than any individual locus, suggesting only small contributions to genetic control of cotyledon opening. in contrast, for the colxkas population epistatic interactions are important, with heritabilities as high as those seen in individual main-effect loci .

the bayxsha loci with significant epistasis also had significant main effects , although the main effects were opposite in their allele contributions . thus, the epistatic interaction is not a simple additive effect. the estimated epistatic high allele is bay, which suggests that the bay allele at bs5_ <dig> interacts equally well with either allele from the bs2_ <dig> region, but the sha allele at bs5_ <dig> is more specific.

as in bayxsha, the lerxcvi epistatic loci also have single-locus main effects. in this case, both single-locus ler alleles contribute to cotyledon opening while the epistatic alleles are from cvi. this suggests that the cvi alleles contribute to a pathway or complex, while the products of the ler alleles work independently.

in the colxkas population with the ck2_75/5_ <dig> pair the allele effect was of the same direction as the individual locus alleles and of intermediate effect size. in this population there was also an epistatic interaction between two new loci on chromosomes  <dig> and 5; these new loci had no significant effect considered separately . this is an example of epistasis with no main effect, which may indicate the epistatic alleles have a negative effect on their interaction partner.

detection of interactions between loci may be useful for predicting which genes under the qtl regions are causal, as metabolic networks and gene families can cause epistasis  <cit> . the four mapping populations vary in extent of epistasis effects, indicating that particular allele interactions underlay the statistical epistasis we detected.

chromosome regions with a uv-b-specific effect
four loci with significant effects in the +uv-b-exposed treatment environment  were identified, bs2_ <dig> from the bayxsha population, ck3_ <dig> from the colxkas population, and lc2_ <dig> plus lc5_ <dig> from the lerxcol population . significant loci detected explained only about one-fourth of the genotype by environment variance. the remaining variance could be explained by presence of a number of additional small-effect loci or by epistatic interactions among more than two markers in these populations.

architecture of canalization loci
the striking differences in the range of cotyledon opening in the ri lines  suggested that genes for the stability of the trait might be segregating in these mapping populations. stability  is known to have a genetic component in flowering and general growth in the lerxcol and lerxcvi populations  <cit> . we found qtl for cotyledon-opening variance in three populations . as expected from previous work, some qtl alleles confer both an effect on the amount of cotyledon opening and an effect on the variance. the cotyledon-opening stability qtl in lerxcol  overlaps with the erecta region qtl found by hall et al.  <cit> . cotyledon-opening stability was also controlled by previously unidentified loci on chromosome  <dig> in lerxcol and chromosome  <dig> in baysha . the chromosome  <dig> s.lco4_ <dig> locus spans  <dig>  mb; candidate genes in this interval include a protein disulfide isomerase   <cit>  and an ascorbic acid biosynthesis gene, vtc <dig>  <cit> . the vtc <dig> mutant appeared to have higher variance in vegetative growth in previous studies  <cit> . the s.lco2_ <dig> erecta-region stability qtl also has an allele-specific uv-b effect; the ler allele variance is higher in the +uv-b environment.

2lerxcol qtl variance components: vg/vp =  <dig>  ve/vp =  <dig>  vge/vp =  <dig>  vr/vp =  <dig> *

*vg is variance of genetic main effects, vp is phenotypic variance, ve is environmental  effects, vge is variance of genotype-by-environment interaction effects, vr is residual variance.

comparisons of chromosomal regions detected in the different populations
we do expect to have the same alleles in geographically distinct accessions if there is strong selection. there is some overlap in the accession represented in the mapping populations, in that ler is in two populations and col in two populations. the col common parent does not condition any common loci but in mapping populations with a ler parent, a region in the top of chromosome  <dig> is present. the additional support for these loci derived from detection in multiple populations illustrates the value of including common parents in mapping populations or using a diallel design to derive ri lines  <cit> .

candidate genes
we examined chromosomal regions spanned by the four uv-b-specific qtl for genes known to be important in uv-b signalling  and for genes with uv-affected expression profiles or annotations suggesting uv function .

we selected criteria for searching for candidate genes under qtl by considering 1) loci found in multiple populations with common alleles 2) loci with uv-b-specific effects 3) loci confirmed with both qtl network and single-marker methods 4) size of region, and 5) the availability of additional information such as expression data on genes located near significant markers and/or annotation of genes with suggestive biochemical functions  <cit> . based on these criteria, a region on the top of chromosome  <dig> was selected.

candidate gene mutant hy <dig> has a defect in uv-b-induced cotyledon opening
in the lerxcol and lerxcvi populations there is a region at the top of chromosome  <dig> identified by qtlnetwork and single-marker analysis as controlling cotyledon opening. examination of this region of the agi arabidopsis map http://www.arabidopsis.org suggested one obvious candidate gene, hy5/at5g <dig>  in this interval. global gene expression experiments have implicated the hy <dig> gene in signal transduction from a uv-b receptor  <cit>  and additional expression measurements have placed the uvr <dig> and hy <dig> genes in that same signal transduction pathway  <cit> .

we examined the cotyledon-opening angles by calculating the medians split on significant parent markers for ler x cvi and ler x col lines. for those ler x cvi lines that have the bh.144l ler marker the uv-b opening angle is greater  than when cvi allele is present ; thus the ler allele of this marker is responsive and cvi allele is less responsive. for the ler x col population, marker c5_ <dig> has a higher median for the ler allele group than the col allele subset, although the uv-b treatment difference is not significant in the qtl network analysis. this suggests that the actual locus conditioned by the ler responsive allele is between anchor markers nga <dig> and nga <dig> on the physical map; this region includes the hy <dig> gene. we examined the available ler genomic sequence  <cit>  in this chromosomal region. there were several polymorphisms in both the coding region and in the 5' utr region of the hy <dig> gene.

as vreugdenhil et al.  <cit>  note, the presence of multiple polymorphisms makes testing of mutants the most efficient strategy for qtl cloning in arabidopsis. thus, we examined uv-b-induced cotyledon opening in a hy <dig> mutant, hy5- <dig>  the mutant was defective in uv-b-induced cotyledon opening . this is the first identification of the role of hy <dig> in the low-fluence cotyledon-opening responses to uv-b, which suggests that the gene expression responses controlled by uvr <dig> and hy <dig>  <cit>  are also involved in uv-induced morphological responses in de-etiolating seedlings. in the future candidate gene insertion mutations near the other uv-specific loci that we have identified could be tested to connect cotyledon opening phenotype differences to additional specific genes.

CONCLUSIONS
extensive characterization of morphological responses such as cotyledon-opening, when combined with genotyped structured mapping populations, allow identification of chromosomal loci and specific locus interactions important for control of the growth response. in addition to the region near hy <dig>  we have identified several other loci associated with uv-b-induced cotyledon opening as well as loci specifying general light-induced opening.
