BACKGROUND
salmon rickettsial syndrome  caused by an intracellular bacterium piscirickettsia salmonis is considered one of the major diseases of the salmonid aquaculture industry in chile  <cit> . srs outbreaks can lead to severe economic losses to farmers because of the high mortality associated with the disease during salt water production  <cit> . it has been estimated that in the chilean atlantic salmon  industry, p. salmonis is responsible for up to 74% of infection-related mortality and economic losses of up to us$ <dig> million. antibiotic treatments may inhibit the growth of the pathogen, but have been unsuccessful in stopping disease outbreaks and pose serious health issues for fish and humans  <cit> . although there are more than  <dig> commercial vaccines available against p. salmonis they have not proven to be consistently effective under field conditions  <cit> .

selective breeding for resistance against infectious diseases represents a realistic and sustainable approach to control disease outbreaks in livestock and aquaculture species  <cit> . traditional aquaculture selection programs for disease traits involves sib-testing where survival phenotype information comes from experimental infection of full-sib family groups of the selection candidates with a specific pathogen  <cit> . however, this method has limited reliability under classical selection schemes because breeding candidates are selected based on mid-parent  estimated breeding values  where only a maximum of 50% of the total genetic variation is exploited  <cit> . in addition, the use of only between-family variation to make selection decisions leads to increased co-selection among close relatives and imposes restrictions on inbreeding  <cit> . nevertheless, previous studies in the same commercial atlantic salmon population used in the present study estimated moderate to medium heritability  for resistance to p. salmonis, indicating the potential for selective breeding for p. salmonis resistance  <cit> .

genetic markers associated with quantitative trait loci  alleles for disease resistance can be used in marker assisted selection  of breeding candidates with genotypes, even in the absence of phenotypes, to accelerate genetic progress  <cit> . the carriers of favorable qtl alleles and its effects are usually identified through dense panels of single nucleotide polymorphisms  using linkage and association mapping . in atlantic salmon, major qtls explaining a considerable proportion of the genetic variation for resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis  <cit>  have been successfully used for mas in breeding companies  <cit> . recently, a genome-wide association study  by correa et al.  <cit>  revealed that resistance to p.salmonis in atlantic salmon is under moderate polygenic control. the same study identified five snp significantly associated with p.salmonis resistance traits in chromosomes ssa <dig> and ssa <dig>  however, due to the small amount of phenotypic variance explained by each marker, it was suggested that resistance to p.salmonis can be more efficiently improved with genetic evaluations incorporating dense snp genotype information compared to mas alone  <cit> . genomic selection  is an alternative method to mas where information from genome-wide marker genotypes  are used in genetic evaluations so that all qtl are in linkage disequilibrium  with at least one marker and selection is based on predicted genomic ebv  . in gs, sibs of the selection candidates with both phenotype and genotype are used to estimate each marker effect and are later used to predict gebv for the selection candidates using only genotypic information  <cit> . in aquaculture, studies using simulated  and real data  <cit>  have shown the superior performance of gs methods in terms of increased genetic gain, accuracy of selection and lower rate of inbreeding.

several gs methodologies varying with respect to assumptions about marker effects have been proposed for the genome-enabled prediction of ebv  <cit> . the most widely used gs methods are the genomic best-linear unbiased prediction  approach using realized genomic relationship matrix calculated from the dense genome-wide snp markers and bayesian methods  . the performance of each of these gs methods varies according to the true underlying genetic architecture among traits and model assumptions  <cit> . therefore, it is valuable to compare the performance of different gs methodologies using real data to identify the best methods, i.e., those which provide accurate gebv predictions over normal pedigree based ebv predictions.

the objectives of this study were i) to compare the reliability of commonly used genomic prediction methods for genomic selection under various underlying genetic models and pedigree based blup for p. salmonis resistance traits in atlantic salmon and ii) to evaluate the effect of different marker densities on the reliability of genomic predictions for different genomic prediction models and pedigree based blup for p. salmonis resistance traits in atlantic salmon.

methods
fish material and challenge test
the breeding program for atlantic salmon was started by the company aquachile  in the year  <dig> with the aim of improving economically important traits. the base population of the breeding nucleus originated from the irish strain fanad-mowi   <cit>  and was introduced during the 1990s to chile through commercial agreements. at present, the breeding program is managed by the breeding company aquainnovo sa at salmones chaicas . all fish material used in this study was from the same breeding program and corresponds to the year-class  <dig>  which has undergone four generations of selection mainly for harvest weight in chilean farming conditions. the fish were hatched during may  <dig> with an approximate mating ratio of one sire to two dams in most cases. a total of  <dig> families were produced as progeny of  <dig> sires and  <dig> dams and reared in separate tanks until tagging. the required number of fish from all families were tagged individually at an average weight of  <dig>  g  using passive integrated transponder-tag , in order to keep pedigree information. tagged fish were reared in a single communal tank for about 14 months before transfer to the aquainnovo’s research station located in lenca river, xth region, chile. after a 29 day acclimation period in salt water  a total of  <dig> fish, an average of  <dig>  fish per family, weighing on average  <dig>  g  were experimentally challenged with p.salmonis as described previously  <cit> . in brief, prior to the challenge test, the fish tested negative for the presence of infectious salmon anaemia virus, infectious pancreatic necrosis virus, renibacterium salmoninarum by rt-pcr and negative for flavobacterium spp. culture. to induce infection, fish were injected with  <dig>  ml of a ld <dig> inoculum of p.salmonis through intra-peritoneal  injection. post ip injection, infected fish were distributed equally by family into three different tanks with salt water  such that each of the  <dig> full-sib families were represented in all three tanks. the challenge test continued for 40 days and mortalities were recorded daily. the kaplan-meier curves of the survival function was plotted for the test period to show the cumulative mortality across the challenge . all surviving fish at day  <dig> were anesthetized and euthanized. tissue samples  for genomic dna isolation were taken from all fish and preserved in 95% ethanol at −80 °c. the procedures for challenge and sampling were approved by the comite de bioetica animal, facultad de ciencias veterinarias y pecuarias, universidad de chile .

genotype data
genomic dna was isolated from the stored fin clip samples of all  <dig> challenge tested fish using a commercial kit , following manufacturer’s protocol. genotyping was performed using a 50 k affymetrix® axiom® mydesign™ snp genotyping array designed by the joint collaboration of aquainnovo sa and the university of chile. the 50 k snp array used in this study was derived from a previously developed and validated custom made 200 k snp array  <cit>  based on several quality control criteria as described previously  <cit> . importantly, the 50 k snp array had markers distributed equally across the genome with a distance of more than 10kb from its neighboring snp  <cit> . genotypes of all fish samples were obtained following best practices analysis workflow from affymetrix  <cit>  and selection of poly-high-resolution and the no-minor-homozygote snps using snpolisher  <cit> . to filter snps quality control of the snp genotype data was performed based on the hardy weinberg equilibrium , minor allele frequency  and the call rate for snps and samples . the quality control step resulted in a total of  <dig> individuals and  <dig>  snps distributed across the genome for further analysis.

phenotypic records and trait definitions
resistance to p. salmonis was considered to be challenge survival, defined as the time to death measured in days  with values ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> depending on the day the fish died; and as binary survival status , scored as  <dig> if the fish died during the 40-day challenge and  <dig> if the fish survived until the end of the challenge. thus, the fish with higher days and a status of  <dig>  were assumed to be more resistant animals. test tank designation and final body weight on the day of death or at the end of the challenge for survivors were recorded.

breeding value estimation
the two resistance traits days and status were analyzed separately as a linear trait and threshold trait, respectively in univariate models. the ebv were estimated using polygenic pedigree based blup   <cit> . the snp effects and gebv were estimated using polygenic pedigree and/or snp genotype information on the basis of genomic blup   <cit> , snpblup  <cit> , bayes c  <cit>  and bayesian lasso  <cit> .

pedigree based blup
the conventional pedigree-based variance components and ebv were estimated using pblup: m <dig> y=xβ+tµ+e 


where β is a vector of fixed overall mean and age of fish at challenge  as co-variate, μ is a vector of random additive genetic polygenic effects with a distribution ~n <dig> aσu <dig>  e is the vector of random error effects with a distribution ~n <dig> iσe <dig>  x and t are the incidence matrices, a is the pedigree-based additive genetic relationship matrix  <cit>  and i is the identity matrix. the trait days was analyzed as a linear trait using airemlf <dig> and gibbs1f <dig>  whereas, the trait status was analyzed as a threshold-linear trait in thrgibbs1f <dig> in blupf <dig> family programs  <cit> . briefly, airemlf <dig> uses average-information reml for estimating variance components for linear traits, gibbs1f <dig> is for the bayesian analysis of linear traits and thrgibbs1f <dig> is for the bayesian analysis of threshold categorical traits  <cit> . for bayesian analysis, the gibbs sampler was run for  <dig>  <dig> iterations with a burn in of  <dig>  <dig> iterations, and samples from every 100th sample were saved.

genomic blup
the snp based variance components and gebv were estimated using gblup, similar to the pblup model  described above. however, in gblup, μ is a vector of random additive genetic polygenic effects with a distribution ~n <dig> gσu <dig>  here, g is the genomic relationship matrix, created as described by vanraden  <cit> . all other parameters and details of the analysis for trait days and status are the same as pblup .

snp based blup method
the snp based blup method used to estimate marker effects and to predict gebv was similar to gblup, where a priori distribution of additive marker locus effects was considered to be normal  <cit> . the model used, psnpblup, combined both marker effects as well as polygenic effect  for all genotyped fish: m <dig> y=xβ+za+tµ+e where a is the additive marker locus effect, z is the incidence matrix relating to marker genotype and all other parameters are the same as pblup . it was assumed that a follows a priori a normal distribution ~n <dig> iσa <dig>  where i is an identity matrix. this model is often called ridge-regression best linear unbiased prediction with a normal distribution of marker effects  <cit> . the trait days was analyzed as a linear-mixed model in the context of henderson’s blup  <cit>  with known variances for all random effects using the keyword blup in the gs <dig> software  <cit> . the trait status was analyzed as a threshold  model assuming known variances. random effects were estimated via gibbs sampler using the keyword mcmcblup in gs <dig> software  <cit> . for both traits, the initial genetic variance σu <dig> and residual variance σe <dig> estimated from the model pblup were used to estimate additive marker variance σa <dig> = σu2/2∑piqi. breeding values for both traits were estimated using marker effects only  using the model snpblup: m <dig> y=xβ+za+e 


all model parameters are as described above. the blup was run for  <dig>  <dig> iterations with convergence criteria of 10− <dig>  and correction every  <dig> iterations. for mcmcblup, a single chain with a length of  <dig>  <dig> iterations was run. the burn-in period and the thinning interval used was  <dig>  <dig> and  <dig> iterations, respectively.

bayesian estimation method: bayes c
the bayes c method is a mixture model for snp effects with an assumption that there is a large group of snps with zero or near zero effects and a second smaller group of snps with larger effect  <cit> . the bayes c method was fitted using the same model equations as in psnpblup  and snpblup , hereafter referred to as pbayesc and bayesc, respectively. all model parameters are defined as above, except the elements of vector a which was calculated for each fish as: ∑i=1nziaiδi where zi is the genotype of i
th marker, ai is the effect marker i, and δi is an indicator variable that explains if the i
th marker has an effect or not. in turn, variables δ have a binomial  distribution with a probability of π being  <dig>  and with a probability of 1-π being  <dig> . an informative beta distribution  was assumed for π  and inverted chi-squared distributions for the different variances σa <dig>  σu <dig> and σe <dig> 

bayesian estimation method: bayesian lasso
the bayesian lasso method was implemented in the context of a linear mixed model assuming an exponential prior distribution for variances of snp marker effects  <cit> . an alternative bayesian implementation of the lasso procedure  <cit> , similar to the model equations psnpblup  and snpblup  as proposed by legarra et al.  <cit> , pblasso and blasso, respectively, were used. all model parameters are defined as above, except the a priori distributions of individual snp effects  which was calculated as: prai|τ2=n1τi2andprτi2=λ22exp−λ2τi <dig>  


individual variances for each snp  are estimated conditionally on a regularization parameter λ, which was estimated by using an a priori gamma distribution bounded between  <dig> and  <dig>  initial value for parameter λ as λ2=2/σa <dig> was used and flat priors were assumed for σa <dig>  σu <dig> and σe <dig> 

all model parameters and snp effects estimated in a bayesian framework  were estimated using the gibbs sampling algorithm implemented in gs <dig> software  <cit> . a single chain with a length of  <dig>  <dig> iterations was run. the burn-in period and the thinning interval used was  <dig>  <dig> and  <dig> iterations, respectively.

genetic parameters and gebv
the total additive genetic variance  estimated in pblup and gblup models was calculated using relationship matrix a and g, respectively. for both trait , the heritabilities were computed as: h2=σu2σu2+σe <dig>  


in contrast, for bayesian models, the total additive genetic variance  was estimated as the sum of additive marker  and polygenic-pedigree  based additive genetic variance; i.e., va′=2σa2π∑piqi+σu <dig> . here, the heritabilities were computed as: h2=va′va′+σe <dig>  


additionally, in snp based blup and bayesian gs methods, the predicted gebv were either generalized genomic breeding values  or just snp effects, depending on whether pedigree and snp information or only snp information was used.

cross validation scheme for model comparison
predictive abilities of the different models described above  were assessed through a five-fold cross validation  scheme. all the fish with both phenotypes and genotypes were randomly sampled into five validation sets. the gebv of the validation data sets were predicted one at a time where the phenotype of the validation fish  was masked  and all remaining fish with phenotype and genotype  were used as training data. to reduce the stochastic effects, the cv analysis was replicated  <dig> times. predictive ability was presented as reliability, which was estimated as: rebv,bv2=rebv,y2h <dig>  where rebv,bv <dig> is the squared correlation between predicted ebv for fish in the validation data in a given model , the recorded phenotype , and a “common” heritability  of the trait which was calculated using pblup with full-data set and without marker information.

the pearson’s correlation coefficients between the ebv obtained by the different models was used to measure the degree of similarity between the rankings of fish. also, for all models, the slope of regression of actual phenotype  on ebv were calculated and used as a measure to indicate the bias of the ebv  <cit> . a slope of regression coefficient close to  <dig> indicates no bias in the model and breeding values are equal in magnitude  <cit> . whereas, a slope of less than  <dig> or greater than  <dig> indicates a biased underestimation or overestimation in the ebv prediction, respectively  <cit> . the reliability, spearman’s rank correlation and slope of regression for each model, were reported as the average of the cv schemes used.

in addition, the effect of marker densities on the estimated reliabilities in different gs models was tested. for this, a random sample of  <dig>  1 k, 3 k and 20 k snps was used separately to predict gebv for all gs models under the cv scheme described above. using the lowest possible snp density with higher or similar reliability of the 50 k snp could help reduce genotyping costs.

the bias of predicted ebv for pblup for days  was lower than for status  , meaning days deviated less from unity than status. across gs models, the bias of predicted gebv for days ranged from  <dig> ± <dig>  to  <dig> ± <dig>  and was similar to the pblup bias . however, for status, the bias of predicted gebv across different gs models varied considerably from  <dig> ± <dig>   to  <dig> ± <dig>  . the bias of ebv for pblup was  <dig> ± <dig>  .

discussion
in this study, a high density 50 k snp array was utilized to estimate genetic parameters and to estimate predictive ability of gs models, which was then compared to traditional pblup for two srs resistance traits; days and status in atlantic salmon.

genetic parameter estimates: pedigree based and genomic heritability
the genetic variance and heritabilities estimated for this population with the pblup linear model for days  and threshold model for status   were consistent with the previously reported heritability estimates for srs phenotypes,  <dig> ± <dig>  and  <dig> ± <dig>  for days and status, respectively  <cit> . a recent study in coho salmon  also reported a similar heritability estimate  for srs resistance trait days  <cit> . several studies in other fish species also reported a similar range of heritability estimates for resistance to different bacterial diseases . in all these studies, genetic parameters were estimated using pedigree based relationship matrices .

heritability is the central breeding program parameter used to estimate response to selection and explain the proportion of phenotypic variance due to genetics  <cit> . the use of genomic information is expected to improve estimates of additive genetic relationships of individuals, reduce the potential confounding of additive genetic variance with residual variance, and lead to better estimates of additive genetic variance and heritability  <cit> . we report an increase in heritability estimates of as much as  <dig> and 86% for days and status, respectively, using genomic-relationship matrix gblup . it is interesting to note that these heritability estimates are higher than estimated by correa et al.  <cit>  for days  and status  with linear and binary threshold models using genomic information from the same data set used in this study. these differences may be explained by the use of different methods to estimate heritability values from genotype data. in the present study, we used the genomic relationship matrix as described by vanraden  <cit> . correa et al.  <cit>  used the rapid method for genome-wide pedigree-based association analysis  <cit> . the increase in heritability estimates in our study can be attributed to better estimates of additive genetic relationship and genetic variance through the use of snp information. the heritability estimated  using bayesian gs models were also higher compared to pblup, but lower than gblup . these differences are mostly due to the fact that for bayesian models, the total additive genetic variance was estimated as the sum of pedigree-based genetic variance  and additive marker genetic variance. for instance, the bayesc method assumes there is a large group of snps with zero or near zero effects and a second smaller group of snps with larger effect  <cit> , the blasso method assumes an exponential prior distribution for variances of snp marker effects  <cit>  and the gblup method assumes all the genotyped markers have an effect and their variance is assumed to be normal  <cit> .

for trait days, the bayesian gs models with both pedigree and snp information  lead to slightly higher heritability estimates possibly because the pedigree information was useful in capturing unmarked loci that are also involved in the genetic control of this trait. in contrast, the heritability estimates were slightly lower from pbayesc and pblasso for status which was probably due to the scaling parameters in the model as well as the binary nature of the trait.

there is always debate about the minimum number of snp markers required and whether causative snps are needed to obtain robust estimates of heritability. the low proportion of phenotypic variance in the population used in this study was previously explained to be the result of primarily polygenic control of srs resistance with few qtls  <cit> . in human studies, ~290 k common frequency snps explained as much as ~45% of the phenotypic variance for height  <cit> . simulation studies have shown that a few thousand markers are enough to accurately estimate heritability  <cit> , and inclusion of causative snps has little effect on prediction accuracy  <cit> . moreover, it is not necessary to know causative snps or snps that are closely linked to the causative snps to obtain reliable estimates of heritability  <cit> . therefore, the heritabilities estimated using  <dig>  snps in the current study can safely be considered reliable.

ranking of ebv and gebv
the gebv predicted from the genomic relationship based gblup and marker-effect based gs models  for both srs resistance traits were moderately correlated  with the predicted ebv . these results suggest that predicted ebv  and gebv  are somewhat different predictors of genetic merit of fish, for these two srs traits, in this population. however, the predicted gebv for both traits with the combined pedigree and marker-effect gs models  showed high correlation  with the predicted ebv. in contrast, for resistance to bacterial cold water disease  a low correlation  between predicted ebv from pblup and gebv from marker-effect based bayesian models was reported  <cit> . the predicted gebv between all gs models were highly correlated  which is in agreement with results from vallejo et al.  <cit> . these high correlations indicate similar ranking of full-families between pblup and gs methods, and within different gs methods.

reliability of pblup and gs models
the accuracy of breeding values estimated in terms of reliability for days  was similar to the previously reported reliabilities for fillet color  and lice resistance  in atlantic salmon using the pblup model  <cit> . however, the trait status was bit lower  . the reliabilities of ebv and gbev were relatively higher for days compared to status, possibly due to the better fit of linear trait days with the linear models than the binary trait status with the threshold models . this is in agreement with the predictive abilities  reported for bcwd which were comparatively higher for days  than status   <cit> .

all gs models outperformed the pblup model with respect to estimated reliabilities for both the traits . in other simulation studies, different gs methods also showed significantly higher accuracy compared to pblup in the typical half/full-sibling family structure of a salmon breeding program  <cit> . a study by Ødegård et al.  <cit>  showed an improvement in accuracies  of  <dig> to 51% for sea lice resistance and, up to 22% for fillet color. for traits such as weight and length in juvenile salmon as much as a 20% improvement of accuracies can be obtained by applying gblup compared to pblup  <cit> .

it was interesting to note that reliability of gebv estimated from combined pedigree and marker effect based gs models  were lower than the models with only marker-effects for the trait days  . the gebv from combined pedigree and marker-effect gs models were expressed as “generalized” gebv, i.e., the sum of “polygenic” and the snp effects  <cit> . whereas, the gebv from marker-effect gs models were just the sum of snp effects which showed high correlation with gebv from gblup . therefore, the presence of the polygenic ebv component in the gebv  showed high correlation with ebv from pblup  and reliabilities were closer to that of ebv. interestingly, gs models with pedigree and marker-effects for days showed reliabilities closer to that of pblup, possibly because the gebv predicted in these models had over-representation of polygenic ebv .

the reliabilities of predicted gebv from different gs models were very close and the differences between gs models were negligible for both traits . on the contrary, vallejo et.al.  <cit>  reported a relatively higher predictive ability of gblup compared to bayesian gs methods using a different gs design and a much smaller number of genotyped samples. recently, we have shown that, resistance to srs is primarily controlled by polygenic inheritance   <cit> . the gebv predicted with gblup utilizes a more accurate genetic relationship calculated from shared snp genotype data and pedigree information rather than just the expected average relationship used in pblup . therefore, gblup may perform better when we have close family relationships in the data as in an aquaculture breeding program. the snp based blup  gs models do not use a genomic relationship matrix and fits snp information as random effects. the bayesian variable selection gs models usually fit markers with only moderate to large effect  <cit> , and are time consuming for routine genetic evaluations. similar to our findings, it has been shown that gblup and bayesian methods  achieve very similar accuracies in dairy cattle data gs analysis for most traits  <cit> . therefore, considering the high correlation of gebv between gblup and bayesian gs methods and negligible differences between reliabilities, the gblup method may be an attractive approach for the routine application of gs to select for srs resistance in atlantic salmon.

effect of marker density on reliability
there is always a debate around the effect of marker density on gs prediction accuracy. the use of a low marker density panel may represent a cost-effective approach for gs prediction especially for aquaculture where thousands of potential breeders need to be genotyped. however, high density marker panels are expected to be more accurate and whole genome sequencing data or targeted causative variants genotyping are expected to give higher accuracies  <cit> . the choice of number of markers for accurate gebv prediction also depends on the ld between the markers and the qtls  <cit> . the use of a low density snp panel with low ld between the markers may result in inaccurate prediction of genetic values for human height as suggested by yang et.al.  <cit> . the atlantic salmon reference assembly genome is up to  <dig>  gigabases  <cit>  with roughly  <dig> centimorgans . the total snp data set with  <dig>  snps analyzed in the present study represented an average genome coverage of ~ <dig>  snps per cm. a simulation study by vela-avitúa et al.  <cit>  showed that an identical-by-descent relationship based gs applied to a typical aquaculture breeding program across traits with different heritabilities  even using sparse markers  showed higher prediction accuracies than pblup.

in our study, a marker density less than 3 k gave considerably lower reliability of gebv, which was likely due to insufficient ld between the markers caused by the large distance between the randomly selected markers . in addition, there was considerable gain in reliability observed from a marker density of 3 k to 20 k. as discussed by Ødegård et.al.  <cit> , the salmon breeding population used in this study historically originated from admixture of several distinct wild strains with expected long-range ld. this might explain the increased reliability of gs models with sparse marker densities as low as 3 k and up to 20 k.

the choice of exact marker density for genotyping a large number of potential breeders would largely depend on the added cost of genotyping and the economic benefit obtained by the extra gain in accuracy of the trait under selection. the cost-benefit is also likely to be most favorable for traits that cannot be measured on potential breeders  and traits with high economic value . also, the marker density of 20 k gave a reliability close to that of highest marker density  showing that the ld between markers at 20 k and 50 k are similar and no additional gain would be obtained using a marker density beyond 20 k . this is in agreement with the findings of Ødegård et.al.  <cit>  that little increase in accuracy was observed with a marker density above 22 k for fillet color or lice resistance in a commercial salmon population.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that different genomic selection models applying a 50 k snp array showed higher accuracy of breeding value prediction in terms of reliability than the model using only pedigree based relationship, pblup, for both days and status with an improvement of approximately  <dig> and 29%, respectively. in the current population, ~ <dig>  high quality informative snps was enough to achieve a similar increase in prediction accuracy. a marker density as low as 3 k and  <dig> snp performed better than pblup for days and status, respectively. therefore, using a lower snp density  or the combination of low snp density  and an imputation strategy may help reduce genotyping cost without compromising the gain in reliability. we are currently working on an imputation strategy to explore the possibility of reducing the genotyping cost. the blup model which uses genomic relationship calculated from pedigree as well as snp information  performed similar to the snp based blup gs models and bayesian variable selection gs models . the relative advantage of using snp data to improve disease resistance depends on the cost of the disease challenge test to collect srs phenotypes, genotyping thousands of training candidates  and validation  which are expensive. the added economic impact of the extra improvement in srs resistance needs to be evaluated carefully.
