BACKGROUND
the development of the endocrine pancreas is governed by a cascade of transcription factors  <cit> . the first regulators are pdx <dig> and ptf1a, which initiate pancreatic bud formation from the foregut and ngn <dig>  which separates the endocrine progenitor cells from the exocrine part of the organ. subsequently, differentiation of the specialized mature endocrine islet cells is dependent upon specific sets of transcription factors for each cell type .

pax <dig> is one of the central regulators of specification and maintenance of the differentiated lineages within the pancreatic islet. it is expressed in the pancreas from embryonic day  <dig>  exclusively in cells already committed to the endocrine tissue and it remains active postnataly in all islet cell types  <cit> . pax <dig> also has major roles in the differentiation of the eye and the central nervous system  <cit> . it contains two dna binding domains, the paired domain and the homeodomain, in addition to a c-terminal transactivation domain.

the pancreatic phenotype of pax6-/- knockout mice suggests that important and non-redundant functions are exerted by the transcription factor in glucagon-expressing α-cells as this cell type is absent in the mutants. additional pancreatic changes are a reduced β-cell mass and disorganized islets  <cit> . the phenotype of inactivating pax <dig> mutations , in which c-terminal deletions eliminate the homeodomain plus the transactivation domain or only the transactivation domain, respectively, is different from that of the knockout mice. in these mutant lines α-cells are present although reduced in numbers  <cit> , which has also been interpreted as α-cell development being relatively normal with the exception of proglucagon gene expression itself  <cit> . the differing observations with knockout mice and pax6sey/sey-neu mutants suggest that the different domains of pax <dig> have diverse and independent functions in the specification of the endocrine cell lineages in the pancreas. support for this hypothesis comes from the analysis of brain and eye development in different pax <dig> mutant mouse lines. here paired domain and homeodomain inactivation cause distinct phenotypes  <cit> .

we ask the question of how the development of pancreatic endocrine cells, in particular that of glucagon-producing α-cells, is affected by selective inactivation of either one of the major domains of the transcription factor pax <dig> 

by analyzing different mutant mouse lines we found that inactivation of the paired domain results in a near complete loss of pancreatic α-cells while homeodomain and transactivation domain mutations led to normal or reduced α-cell numbers. our results suggest a hierarchy in the roles of the three domains of pax <dig> in pancreatic α-cell development. these findings could also help to reconcile the discordant observations previously reported for pax <dig> domain-specific or knockout mutants.

RESULTS
loss of pax <dig> paired domain but not of transactivation domain function leads to a near complete absence of fully differentiated α-cells
to assess the functional role of the pax <dig> paired domain in pancreatic endocrine development we studied the mutant mouse line pax6aey <dig> in which a splice acceptor site in front of exon  <dig> is missing and consequently exons 5a and  <dig> are not included in the mature rna. this deletion renders the pai dna-binding unit of the paired domain inactive. the homeodomain and the transactivation domain remain intact in this mutant   <cit> .

like pax6-/- null homozygotes of pax6aey <dig> die within hours after birth. we therefore analyzed the pancreas of e <dig>  homozygotes in comparison to wild type  littermates. gross morphology of the pancreas was similar in both groups. however, we found that glucagon-producing α-cells were severely reduced in paired domain mutant embryos. only 0- <dig> weakly glucagon-positive single cells per section were detected by immunostaining with the most sensitive of  <dig> different antibodies . the area of insulin-producing β-cells was reduced to 74% of wt in the mutant animals  while size of individual cells was unchanged . islet structure was disorganized . thus, the pancreatic phenotype of the pax6aey <dig> paired domain mutants is similar to that of the pax6-/- knockout mice  <cit> . the proportion of somatostatin-positive δ-cells appeared unchanged but the number of pp cells also seemed reduced . an exact quantification of these cells was not performed.

for comparison we also examined e <dig>  pancreas of pax6sey-neu homozygous mutants. in these animals α-cells were present at 25% of wt animals  as was previously reported by others   <cit> . also similar to previous findings, β-cells were reduced to 40%  and islet structure was disorganized although less severe than in pax6aey <dig>   <cit> . the proportion of δ- and pp cells appeared unchanged .

paired domain inactivation not only affects proglucagon gene transcription but also results in an increase of ghrelin positive ε-cells and a reduced expression of prohormone convertase 2
the question has been raised whether pax <dig> truly affects α-cell lineage commitment in the endocrine pancreas or whether it only directly targets proglucagon transcription  <cit> . to address this issue we first analyzed the distribution of the other endocrine cell types in the pax6aey <dig> mutant pancreas.

we found an ~5fold expansion of ghrelin+ cells  compared to wt littermates. all ghrelin+ cells were quantified in figure 3b regardless of their glucagon expression. glucagon/ghrelin double-positive cells were present in wt animals as previously described by others  <cit>   but absent in pax6aey <dig> homozygotes. thus we classified the ghrelin+ cells in the mutants as ε-cells. the quantity of additional ε-cells in the mutants was approximately equal to the reduction of α-cells, which indicates ghrelin expression in cells that are ghrelin- in wt and could suggest a lineage switch from α- to ε-cells. a similar phenomenon has been described in pax6sey mice  <cit> . pax <dig> was expressed in ε-cells cells to various degrees, from undetectable to comparable to other islet cell types, both in mutant and wt pancreas .

we also analyzed the expression of other relatively alpha cell specific genes in e <dig>  pax6aey <dig> pancreas compared to wt by rtpcr. we tested prohormone convertase  <dig> , which is a known pax <dig> target  <cit>  but in addition to alpha cells is also expressed in beta and cells  <cit>  as well as arx, brn <dig>  irx <dig> and gata <dig> for which evidence exists in the literature that they are quite alpha cell specific  <cit> ., and smad <dig>  which favors alpha cell generation when overexpressed  <cit> . a significant reduction in expression in the mutants was only detected for pc <dig> in addition to the expected change in proglucagon transcription. arx expression was increased in pax6aey <dig> .

taken together the findings of ε-cell expansion and partially altered α-cell gene expression in paired domain mutant animals indicate a role of pax <dig> in α-cell development that goes beyond proglucagon gene transcription. however, pax <dig> probably functions late in lineage commitment, as the expression of major transcriptional regulators of α-cell development is not affected.

the pax6aey <dig> paired domain mutation  leads to reduced nuclear localisation of pax <dig> in vitro and in vivo
immunostaining of pax <dig> in pax6aey <dig> mutants revealed an altered intracellular distribution of the protein compared to wt. while pax <dig> has an almost exclusive nuclear localization in wt increased cytoplasmatic immunoreactivity was observed in many mutant cells . in some, staining was predominantly cytoplasmatic  while others showed equal cytoplasmatic and nuclear staining or largely exclusive nuclear pax <dig> similar to wt. a comparable staining pattern was seen in the forebrain of mutant embryos . in the pax6aey <dig> mouse line the exons 5a and  <dig> are deleted. since exon 5a is only included in one of the pax <dig> isoforms we hypothesized that a nuclear localization signal  is located within exon  <dig> and that its absence results in enhanced cytoplasmatic sequestering of pax <dig> in the pax6aey <dig> mutants. we first performed a computational analysis of the pax <dig> sequence with the psort ii algorithm but found no classical nls in any part of the protein, including exon  <dig>  we therefore conducted an in vitro study to confirm a role of exon  <dig> in nuclear localization. wild type pax <dig> and the transcription factor with a deletion of exon  <dig> were transiently transfected into ins-1e insulinoma cells  <cit>  serving as a model system for pancreatic endocrine cells. using an antibody against the transactivation domain we determined the subcellular localization of the protein. we found a significant shift towards cytoplasmatic localization in cells transfected with pax6Δexon <dig> but no complete block of transfer into the nucleus , similar to what is seen in vivo. only cells that clearly over-expressed the transcription factor over its endogenous level where counted.

exon <dig> therefore contributes to the nuclear localization of pax <dig>  however, since nuclear pax <dig> is still detected in many cells this does not fully explain the phenotype of the pax6aey <dig> mutant mice.

two neighboring point mutations in the homeodomain have differential effects on pancreatic endocrine development
we next analyzed the role of the second dna binding domain of pax <dig>  the homeodomain, in the development of the endocrine pancreas. we examined two mutant mouse lines, pax64neu and pax6132-14neu , in which point mutations in the third helix of the homeodomain abolish the binding of that domain to the p <dig> homeodomain consensus dna sequence  <cit> . although neighboring amino acids are affected in the two mutants  pax64neu homozygotes die shortly after birth while pax614neu mutants live to adulthood and are fully fertile.

we studied e <dig>  embryos homozygous for the pax64neu mutation and found that gross pancreatic morphology was unchanged in the mutant animals compared to wt. quantification of both α- and β-cells revealed that they were reduced to  <dig> and 61%, respectively. the ratio of α- to β-cells remained unchanged . we next examined  <dig> week old pax614neu homozygotes and compared them to wt controls. fasting blood glucose was not significantly different . morphologically, islet architecture was unchanged  in the mutants. islet- and α-cell area also were comparable to wt controls .

discussion
we address the question of whether the three major domains of the transcription factor pax <dig>  the paired domain, the homeodomain and the transactivation domain, have distinct roles in pancreatic endocrine development. we were particularly interested in glucagon-secreting α-cells, as that is the cell type that is absent in pax6-/- knockout mice  <cit> .

we found that the pancreatic phenotype of the pax6aey <dig> mutant mouse line, in which the paired domain is inactivated by a partial deletion, closely resembles that of the knockout mice. these mutants exhibit a near complete loss of glucagon-positive α-cells , a disorganized islet structure and a reduced β-cell area. a lack of pax <dig> protein expression or protein degradation caused by the partial deletion of the gene can be excluded as a reason for this phenotype as pax <dig> is clearly detected by immunostaining with an antibody against the transactivation domain. a general change in protein conformation, caused by the paired domain mutation, that contributes to the severe phenotype remains possible. it is however most likely that it is the inactivated paired domain directly that is responsible for the developmental alteration since loss of either of the other two major protein domains of pax <dig> does not result in such a severe phenotype.

endocrine development in pax6sey-neu mutants, that were often viewed as equivalent to pax6-/- knockouts, was strikingly different. in homozygotes, glucagon-positive α-cells were present at 25% of wt. this is in accordance with previous studies of pax6sey and pax6sey-neu mutants  <cit> . both strains share the loss of the transactivation domain but have an intact paired domain. the pax <dig> knockouts on the other hand were generated by replacing the start codon and the entire paired domain with a beta-galactosidase neomycin cassette. no pax <dig> protein was detected in these embryos  <cit> . taken together we show that a functional pax <dig> paired domain is more important for full α-cell development than the transactivation domain. gene activation by pax <dig> occurs in cooperation with other transcription factors, particularly large mafs  <cit> . both the paired domain and the homeodomain have been shown to independently facilitate at least a weak protein interaction  <cit> . it is therefore conceivable that in the pax6sey-neu mutants transcriptional activation, e.g. of the proglucagon gene, is achieved through the recruitment of other transcription factors to pax <dig> binding sites. no compensation however seems possible for the loss of paired domain function suggesting that in the pancreas this domain acts as a major dna anchor for transcriptional activator complexes involving pax <dig>  the finding by sander et al.  <cit>  that no immunreactive pax <dig> can be detected in the pancreas of pax6sey-neu homozygous embryos with an antiserum raised against the paired domain is difficult to reconcile with the presence of a substantial number of α-cells in these mutants. in light of our findings and the knockout phenotype some residual pax <dig> seems necessary for glucagon-positive cells to develop to the extent seen in these mutants. possible explanations could be an expression level below the sensitivity of immunostaining or conformational changes in the pax6sey-neu protein that diminish the binding of the antiserum.

the proglucagon gene is a direct target of pax <dig>  which binds to the g <dig> and g <dig> elements of the gene promoter, mainly via the paired domain  <cit> . thus the question arises whether pax <dig> is truly involved in the lineage commitment of α-cells or whether the phenotype upon pax <dig> inactivation is only the result of impaired glucagon expression in otherwise fully differentiated α-cells  <cit> . we addressed this issue by first looking at changes in other endocrine lineages and also by analyzing the expression of other genes related to α-cell differentiation. we found an ~5fold increase in the number of ghrelin-positive ε-cells in the paired domain mutants. a similar observation has been reported previously for pax6sey  <cit>  and also for nkx <dig>  null mice  <cit> . the expansion of ε-cells in our study is approximately equal to the reduction in the number of α-cells. this suggests a lineage switch from α- to ε-cells although we do not provide direct evidence for that. one possible alternative explanation could be a β-cell to ε-cell switch as β-cells are also significantly reduced in the mutant mice. we also analyzed a number of relatively α-cell specific genes in the paired domain mutants but only found a reduction in the expression of proglucagon and prohormone convertase  <dig>  both genes are known targets of pax <dig>  <cit>  but pc <dig> is also expressed in beta and cells, in addition to alpha cells  <cit> . expression of the relatively α-cell specific transcription factors brn <dig> and irx <dig> was unchanged, while the expression of arx was increased. overall our results indicate that the developmental phenotype after pax <dig> inactivation is more extensive than only an absent proglucagon transcription but that the disruption of α-cell development occurs at a late stage downstream of brn <dig>  irx <dig> and arx. this in accordance with previous findings  <cit> . the observed increase in arx expression could be the result of a feedback loop but experimental evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. similarly, it is currently unknown how the likely de-repression of ghrelin occurs in the different pax <dig> mutants.

we also found that a deletion of exon  <dig>  as in pax6aey <dig>  leads to increased cytoplasmatic localization of the transcription factor although no classical nls is present in this sequence. our observation however is in line with a previous analysis of naturally occurring splice variants of the avian homologue of pax <dig>  pax-qnr  <cit> . the reduced nuclear localization of pax <dig> might add to the phenotype of the pax6aey18mutants. however, it does not by itself explain the near complete absence of α-cells since nuclear pax <dig> at the level of wt controls is still detectable in a proportion of endocrine cells in the mutant embryos.

the homeodomain of pax <dig> seems to have a modulating effect on pancreatic endocrine development. for classical homeodomain function, dimers of homeodomain transcription factors bind to a palindromic target sequence, e.g. p <dig> in the case of pax <dig>  <cit> . we analyzed two homeodomain mutants, pax64neu and pax614neu. neighboring amino acids are mutated in the two lines and both point mutations abolish binding to the p <dig> homeodomain target sequence  <cit> . however, activation of a proglucagon promoter fragment containing the g <dig> element is differentially affected by the two mutations. pax64neu shows a decreased function compared to wt while the activity of pax614neu is slightly increased  <cit> . we found that pax64neu mutants, which die shortly after birth , show a reduced endocrine cell mass with both α and β-cells affected to a similar extent. pax614neu homozygotes that develop to adulthood on the other hand had normal islet morphology, unchanged islet- and α-cell areas and normal fasting blood glucose. these observations suggest that independent homeodomain binding of pax <dig> to p <dig> elements is of little importance in the development of the endocrine pancreas although a detailed analysis of glucose metabolism in adult pax614neu mice has yet to be done. our findings rather indicate that the homeodomain co-activates paired domain target genes and that this is impaired by the pax64neu but not by the pax614neu mutation. this is in line with the activity of both mutated proteins on the proglucagon promoter  <cit> . a possible explanation could be that the homeodomain facilitates a ph0-like binding confirmation  <cit>  of pax <dig> on target genes relevant for pancreatic endocrine development. this binding confirmation has already been demonstrated for the rat proglucagon promoter g <dig> and g <dig> sites  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate in this study that the paired domain of pax <dig> is more important for the full differentiation of glucagon-producing pancreatic α-cells than its transactivation domain. independent dna binding of the pax <dig> homeodomain seems least relevant in the pancreas. the homeodomain rather appears to have a modulating role in the function of the transcription factor, possibly by facilitating a ph0-like binding confirmation on paired domain target genes.
