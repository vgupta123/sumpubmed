BACKGROUND
infection with shiga toxin -producing escherichia coli  is the most significant cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome , the leading cause of acute renal failure in children  <cit> . of the two antigenically distinct toxins, stx <dig> and stx <dig>  stx <dig> is more firmly linked with the development of hus. stx <dig> and stx <dig> are similar in basic structure  <cit> , binding specificity  <cit>  and mode of action. epidemiologic studies show that stx2-producing strains are more frequently associated with hus than strains that produce both stx <dig> and stx2; while stx <dig> alone has rarely been associated with hus  <cit> .

stx <dig> and stx <dig> consist of an a-subunit monomer and a b-subunit pentamer  <cit> . the pentameric b subunit binds to its cell surface receptor globotriaosyl ceramide   <cit> . internalized stx follows retrograde transport to the trans-golgi network and subsequently to the endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol  <cit> . during this trafficking, the a subunit is nicked by the membrane-bound furin protease, generating a catalytically active n-terminal a <dig> fragment and a c-terminal a <dig> fragment; both fragments remain linked by a disulfide bond  <cit> . the disulfide bond is subsequently reduced, and the active a <dig> component is released. the released a <dig> fragment has n-glycosidase catalytic activity and it removes a specific adenine base from the 28s rrna of the 60s ribosomal subunit  <cit> . because this adenine base is on a loop of rrna that is important for elongation factor binding, stx is able to shut down the protein synthesis and cause cell death.

we have produced human monoclonal antibodies  against stx <dig> and stx <dig>  and evaluated them in animal models for their efficacy against systemic challenge with the toxins  <cit> . we selected 5c <dig>  a stx <dig> a subunit-specific humab, based on its superior efficacy in protecting mice against lethal challenge with stx <dig> and stx <dig> variants  <cit>  for preclinical evaluation in the piglet diarrhea model challenged orally with stec. this antibody protected piglets against stx2-induced fatal neurological symptoms, even when administered well after the onset of diarrhea following oral stec challenge   <cit> . in this model, diarrheal symptoms precede systemic complications associated with stx <dig> uptake from the gut, as is observed in children. similarly, stx <dig> b subunit-specific humab 5 h <dig> also protects piglets  <cit>  and mice against stx <dig> intoxication  <cit> .

while these humabs completely protect healthy piglets and mice from stx2-mediated death, there remains a concern among nephrologists for the potential formation of immune stx2/antibody complexes in a severely damaged kidney of patients with hus. in the mouse model, the kidneys are the major target organ of stx2-intoxication. in this model, stx <dig> causes apoptosis of medullary and cortical tubular cells in the kidneys, and leads to renal failure due to the loss of functioning collecting ducts  <cit> . in the present experiments we investigated the likely site of stx2/antibody localization and clearance using the mouse model of systemic intoxication treated with these potentially therapeutic antibodies.

methods
stx2
stx <dig>  purified from e. coli c600w as described previously  <cit> , was obtained from phoenix laboratory . the toxin was dissolved at  <dig> μg/ml in phosphate buffered saline , aliquoted and stored at −20°c.

stx2-specific humabs
production of stx2a-specific 5c <dig> and stx2b-specific 5h <dig> humabs have been described elsewhere  <cit> . these antibodies were purified by protein a affinity chromatography, dialyzed against pbs, quantified by uv spectrophotometry , aliquoted, and stored at −20°c.

iodination of stx2
purified stx <dig> was iodinated by a modification of the chloramine t method  <cit> . briefly, one millicurie of carrier-free na125i  was added to  <dig> to 30 μg of stx <dig> in 100 μl of pbs. then, 20 μl of chloramine t  was added, and incubated for  <dig> seconds. the iodination was terminated by adding 20 μl of sodium metabisulfite . ten μl of potassium iodide  was subsequently added to scavenge the free iodine. the iodinated stx <dig>  was separated from free 125i by filtration through a polyacrylamide column .

biodistribution of 125i-stx <dig>  and 125i-stx2/humab complexes
the mouse toxicity model  <cit>  was used to study biodistribution of 125i-stx <dig>  and 125i-stx2/humab complexes. four-week-old female c57bl/ <dig> mice weighing 18–22 g  were injected intraperitoneally  with pbs or  <dig> μg/mouse of a stx2-specific humab . after 4 hr, mice were administered intravenously  with 100 ng/mouse  of 125i-stx <dig> as a single bolus dose. the 125i-stx <dig> dose of 100 ng/mouse is  <dig> times the ld <dig> dose  <cit> . an isotype control was not included in the current experiments as we have consistently found no difference between isotype control and pbs groups  <cit> . the isotype control antibody does not interact with the toxin and mice die within 3 days of either pbs or isotype control antibody administration  <cit> . similarly, piglets also succumb to stx2-mediated systemic complication following either pbs or isotype control antibody administration  <cit> . a group of  <dig> mice from each treatment group  was euthanized at 3 h,  <dig> and 2 days post-125i-stx <dig> injection. blood was collected from these mice before euthanasia, and tissues and urine were collected after euthanasia. the fluids and tissues were analyzed for radioactivity by a gamma counter . a group of  <dig> mice injected iv with 100 ng of 125i-bsa was used as a control to the radiolabeled toxin injected group.

stx <dig> was labeled again with 125i and the experiment repeated once to obtain  <dig> mice per treatment group. the data were presented as a percentage of injected dose of radioactive toxin  per gram  of an organ tissue, or per ml  of a fluid. the% id/g or% id/ml was calculated by the formula:  x  <dig> 

biological activity of the radiolabeled stx2
the mouse toxicity model was also used to ensure that radiolabeled stx <dig> was biologically active and that stx2-specific humabs neutralized the toxin activity. briefly,  <dig> μg/mouse of a stx2-specific humab, or pbs, was injected ip 4 hr prior to iv administration of 100 ng 125i-stx2/mouse. mice were observed  <dig> or more times daily for clinical signs and survival until 11 day post-toxin administration.

all animal studies described in the above  <dig> sections were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the institutional animal care and use committee, tufts university.

statistical analysis
for statistical analysis of total radioactivity remaining in the body following 3 h,  <dig> and 2 days of 125i-stx <dig> injection in different treatment groups, the pair wise comparison was done using student t-test and wilcoxon rank test. for statistical analysis of radioactivity in each organ at a particular time point , nonparametric kruskal-wallis and wilcoxon rank tests were performed to evaluate significant differences among the four treatment groups. the analyses were performed using statistical software . resulting p-values of less than  <dig>  were considered significant.

RESULTS
biological activity of radiolabeled  and neutralization of 125i-stx <dig> by stx2-specific humabs
purified stx <dig> consisted of only a and b subunits . 125i-stx <dig> was biologically active as none of the mice survived 125i-stx <dig> challenge in the pbs group . they either died or became severely ill and were euthanized 57–64 h or  <dig> - <dig>  days following toxin administration . all stx2-specific humabs neutralized the lethal biological activity of 125i-stx <dig> as all mice in humab groups survived the 125i-stx <dig> challenge until the end of the experiment  .

distribution of 125i-stx <dig>  and 125i-stx2/humab complexes in blood
in the control 125i-bsa group, 98% of 125i-bsa was eliminated from the body, and most of the remaining 2% 125i-bsa was localized in urine and blood 1 day post-125i-bsa administration .

at 3 h post-125i-stx <dig> administration, the toxin localized significantly more in blood of groups receiving humabs 5c <dig> or 5h <dig> than the pbs group . however, the concentration of the toxin between the humab groups did not differ significantly at this time point.

on days  <dig> and  <dig>  the toxin localized significantly more in blood of groups receiving humabs 5c <dig> than the pbs and 5h <dig> groups . the toxin concentration did not differ significantly between 5h <dig> and pbs. on these days, the relative mean toxin concentration in blood in each group was: 5c12 > 5h8 > pbs .

distribution of 125i-stx <dig>  and 125i-stx2/humab complexes in urine
excretion of radioactivity in urine did not differ significantly between treatment groups at 3 h and 1 day after 125i-stx <dig> administration . on day  <dig>  the radioactivity localized significantly more in the urine of humab groups than the pbs group .

distribution of 125i-stx <dig>  and 125i-stx2/humab complexes in tissues
at 3 h, the toxin concentration in the pbs group was significantly different from both 5c <dig> and 5h <dig> antibody treatment groups in only two organs, the kidneys and the liver . in the cerebrum, the toxin concentration in the 5h <dig> group was significantly different from the pbs and 5c <dig> groups, and in the stomach, the toxin concentration in the 5h <dig> group was significantly different from the 5c <dig> group but not from the pbs group . in the mesenteric lymph nodes , the toxin concentration in the 5h <dig> group differed significantly from the pbs group but not from the 5c <dig> group . the toxin concentration in any of the remaining organs did not differ significantly between any treatment groups . based on the numerical mean radioactivity concentration, highest concentrations were found in the kidneys , liver  and liver  of pbs, 5c <dig> and 5h <dig> groups, respectively . while the toxin concentration in the kidneys was significantly greater in the pbs group than the humab groups, it did not differ significantly among kidneys of the 5c <dig> and 5h <dig> groups. the toxin concentration in the liver was significantly higher in the 5c <dig> and 5h <dig> groups than in the pbs group but did not differ significantly between the 5c <dig> and 5h <dig> groups.

1distribution of 125i-stx <dig> in the kidney and the liver following 3 h, 1 day and 2 days of 125i-stx <dig> injection. mice were given intraperitoneally pbs or  <dig> μg of humabs 5c <dig> or 5h <dig> followed  <dig> hours later with intravenous administration of 100 ng of 125i-stx <dig>  distribution of 125i-stx <dig> in the kidney and the liver was determined following 3 h, 1 day and 2 days of 125i-stx <dig> injection, and expressed as “% injected dose /g tissue”.

a-c values with different letters  within a tissue indicate differences are statistically significant  among those treatment groups. values with same letter superscript within a tissue indicate differences are not statistically significant among those treatment groups.

on day  <dig>  the toxin concentration in the pbs group again differed significantly from both 5c <dig> and 5h <dig> antibody treatment groups in only two organs, the kidneys and the liver . in the mln, the toxin concentration in the 5h <dig> group differed significantly from the pbs and 5c <dig> groups , and in the heart, the toxin concentration in the pbs group differed significantly from the 5c <dig> group but not from the 5h <dig> group . the toxin concentration in any of the remaining organs did not differ significantly between any treatment groups . maximal levels of stx <dig> localized in the kidneys of pbs  group, in the kidneys  and liver  of 5h <dig> group, and in the liver, spleen and kidneys  of 5c <dig> group . liver was a major organ of toxin accumulation in 5h <dig> and 5c <dig> groups but not in pbs  group. the toxin concentration in the kidneys of the pbs group was significantly greater than in the kidneys of the 5c <dig> and 5h <dig> groups. the toxin concentration in the liver of the pbs was significantly lower than that of the 5c <dig> and 5h <dig> groups. the toxin concentration in the liver and kidneys did not differ significantly between the 5c <dig> and 5h <dig> groups.

on day  <dig>  based on the numerical means, the kidneys were the organ where maximum toxin accumulated in the pbs  group, whereas maximal levels of the toxin in the 5h <dig> group localized in the liver and spleen , and in the 5c <dig> group in the liver, kidneys and spleen  . significantly more toxin localized in the livers of the 5c <dig> and 5h <dig> groups than the liver of pbs group. the toxin was barely detectable in cerebrum and cerebellum , and other organs .

discussion
the purpose of this investigation was to establish the site of stx <dig> accumulation in the intoxicated host, and whether administration of highly protective antibodies impacts this outcome. in addition, the site of accumulation of stx2/antibody complexes in patients with hus is of particular concern to nephrologists, should the site be the kidneys leading to further renal dysfunction. the results of the present study suggest that humabs 5c <dig> and 5h <dig> facilitated hepatic clearance of stx <dig> as maximal levels of radioactivity in these groups were present in the liver at 3 h after 125i-stx <dig> administration. the liver was also a major organ of radioactivity accumulation in these  <dig> groups at day  <dig> and day  <dig> sampling times, largely sparing the kidney. in contrast, kidneys were the major target organ of 125i-stx <dig> accumulation in the pbs group at all  <dig> sampling times, indicating that rapid hepatic elimination of stx <dig> did not occur in this group. other studies have previously shown that soluble immune complexes are cleared primarily by the liver through uptake into kupffer cells  <cit> .

the results of the present study show that accumulation of stx <dig> in the kidneys is significantly blocked by the humabs 5c <dig> and 5h <dig> as radioactivity accumulated in the kidneys of these two groups at much lower levels than the kidneys of the pbs group. as all mice in the 5c <dig> and 5h <dig> groups did not show any clinical signs of stx2-intoxication and survived, the renal presence of stx <dig> in these mice appear to have had minimal clinical impact. in contrast, all mice in the pbs group succumbed to stx2intoxication, and toxin presence in the kidneys of this group may have contributed to their deaths. stx <dig> in the kidneys of mice is toxic and causes apoptosis of medullary and cortical tubular cells, and renal failure due to the loss of functioning collecting ducts  <cit> . these results suggest that stx2/5c <dig> or stx2/5h <dig> complexes are less likely to accumulate in the kidneys in patients with hus, and less likely to exacerbate the condition further.

gb <dig> expression on neuronal cells in mouse central nervous system and its binding with stx <dig> has recently been shown  <cit> , which also explains earlier observations of stx <dig> localization in the spinal cord  <cit> . in the present study, significantly more toxin was measured in the cerebrum but not cerebellum of the pbs and 5c <dig> groups than in the 5h <dig> group at the 3 h sampling time. this suggests that toxin can bind to the cerebrum but not the cerebellum, and that 5h <dig> but not 5c <dig> can block this binding. significant differences in toxin accumulation in cerebrum or cerebellum did not occur on day  <dig> or day  <dig> in any of the groups. note however, that in the present study, cerebral toxin accumulation in pbs and 5c <dig> groups was much less than the accumulation of toxin in the kidney, a well known target of stx <dig>  the spinal cord was not included in the present study.

the stomach was one of the major organs of radioactivity accumulation  in all treatment groups. the stomach has previously been shown to accumulate radioactivity in mice injected with radiolabeled stx <dig>  <cit> . presumably, sequestration of the released radioiodide in the stomach may have occurred due to the dehalogenation effect  <cit> .

rutjes et al.  <cit>  reported that the highest concentrations of stx <dig> localized in the nasal turbinates followed by the lungs and kidneys. stx2-specific antibodies were not used in that study  <cit> . the lungs, but not the nasal turbinates were included in the present study, and with regards to toxin concentration, they were the fourth highest in the pbs and 5h <dig> groups, and the sixth highest in 5c <dig> group at 3 h sampling time . as the previous  <cit>  and the present studies used radioiodinated stx <dig> and the iv route of toxin administration, the discrepancy between the two investigations may be related to sampling time after toxin administration , and/or the strain of mouse used . nevertheless, the kidney was a major target organ for stx <dig> in both studies  <cit> . stx <dig> is known to have a propensity for lymphoid cells  <cit>  as is shown by binding of the toxin within mln in the present study.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of the present study suggest that the interaction of stx <dig> with humabs 5c <dig> and 5h <dig> inhibited accumulation of the toxin in the kidney, the major target organ of stx2-intoxication, and lead instead to rapid accumulation of stx <dig> in the liver, an organ known to clear soluble immune complexes in vivo  <cit> .
