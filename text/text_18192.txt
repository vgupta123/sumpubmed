BACKGROUND
filoviruses  are single-stranded negative sense rna viruses that infect humans and primates. fv quickly obtunds the immune system and dysregulates coagulation  <cit> . the mortality rate can be up to 90 % and is species-dependent. fv are category a bioterrorism agents, and there are currently no licensed vaccines or treatments. fv induce a myriad of cellular effects that quickly overwhelm the immune system, which results in compromised fv antigen processing and presentation capabilities  <cit> , depleted t-cells and poor cytotoxic t-cell  response  <cit>  and abrogated protective antibody production  <cit> .

the ebola gp <dig>  glycoprotein is responsible for viral binding and entry. it is a trimer with a chalice-like form  <cit> . the receptor binding region is inside the chalice and the exterior is highly glycosylated. the receptors binding domains and heptad repeats in the base are highly conserved sequences among the fv species. the ability to generate a cellular t-cell response contributes to surviving the disease. the role of t-cells in controlling ebola and marburg infections has been recognized  <cit> . in mice, cd8+ t-cell depletion and perforin knockouts studies using fv have shown the need for ctl to survive infection  <cit> . however, the ctl responses to fv in non-human primates have not been well characterized given the technical challenges of working in a bsl- <dig> environment.

several fv vaccine constructs have been demonstrated to be protective in mice, guinea-pigs and non-human primates . irradiated ebola virus encapsulated in liposomes containing lipid a elicited gp <dig>  specific ctl response  <cit>  and attenuated venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicons expressing gp <dig>   <cit>  showed protective responses in mice. an improved vaccination strategy using dna plasmids expressing mixtures of different gp <dig>  along with nucleoprotein  and further boosting with recombinant adenovirus expressing gp <dig>  proved effective in eliciting protection against live ebola virus challenge in cynomolgus macaques  <cit> . vesicular stomatitis virus based vaccines encoding gp <dig>  protected nhp from bundibugyo ebola virus  <cit> . respiratory tract immunization of nhp with a newcastle disease virus-vectored vaccine showed protective response against ebola virus challenge  <cit> . live attenuated rabies virus vaccine expressing gp <dig>  has been proposed for its safe use for vaccination in humans and wildlife  <cit> . also, the recombinant protein, ebola zaire gp <dig>  fc, protected mice from lethal mouse adapted ebola zaire challenge  <cit> .

identifying immunodominant epitopes provides critical insight into the mechanism of protection to fv. immunodominant peptides of ebov gp <dig>   and lassa gp <dig>  and ebola nucleoprotein have been determined  <cit> . importantly, mhc tetramer technology has simplified the study of antigen-specific ctls to determine the functional sensitivities of t-cell populations  <cit> . tetramers are fluorochrome-conjugated peptide–major histocompatibility complex  multimers that are used in the study of antigen-specific t-cells by enabling their visualization, enumeration, phenotypic characterization and have been extensively used to track t-cells ex-vivo following vaccination or during viral infection  <cit> . as a result, tetramers can be used as surrogate markers of cell mediated immunity. on the other hand, b-cell mediated responses, especially antibodies specific to gp <dig>  co-related with protection in nhps and mice  <cit> . the postexposure antibody treatments demonstrated to protect nhps from filovirus infection  <cit> . in sum, development of effective ebola vaccine would require both protective ctls as well as a robust antibody response to ensure survival to lethal ebola challenge.

in the present study we identified immunodominant peptides of the gp <dig>  from ebola zaire in balb/c mice for the kd mhc using in silico algorithms. the objective was to generate tetramers that can be used to follow ctl. peptide candidates were screened and three peptides stabilized the kd mhc: p <dig>  eylfevdnl, amino acids  231–240; p <dig>  lflrattel, aa 571–579; and p <dig>  lydrlastv, aa 161– <dig>  splenocytes from peptide immunized mice generated ifn-γ upon in vitro re-stimulation and induced apoptosis in peptide sensitized targets. tetramers for all three peptides were generated that detected antigen specific t-cells following immunization. significantly, two of the three epitopes are conserved within fv which suggests that tetramer reagents will be useful in following cell mediated responses to zaire vaccine candidates such as gp <dig>  recombinant proteins, gp <dig>  expressing virus like particles, recombinant vsv, adenoviruses and gp <dig>  dna vaccines.

RESULTS
in silico predictions of gp <dig>  immuno-dominant epitopes
the gp <dig>  sequence of ebola zaire was analyzed using both bimas and syfpeithi algorithms to identify peptides that may possess high binding affinity to kd mhc. three peptides scored better than  <dig> for bimas and  <dig> for syfpeithi, and these are presented in table  <dig>  these were p <dig>  eylfevdnl amino acids  231– <dig>  <cit> ; p <dig>  lflrattel aa 571–579; and p <dig>  lydrlastv aa 161– <dig>  <cit> . these peptides were synthesized for further characterization. this is the first report of evaluation of immunological response analysis for peptide p <dig>  the peptide p <dig> , was identified in  <dig> by kent et al.,  and was submitted to immune epitope database and analysis resource and can be found at the following link, http://www.iedb.org/epid/ <dig>  peptides p <dig> and p <dig> were previously reported by dowling et al.  <cit>  and warfield et al.  <cit>  respectively.table  <dig>

gp <dig>  from ebola zaire was analyzed both by bimas and syfpeithi. nonomer peptides that scored greater or equal to  <dig> on bimas and  <dig> on syfpeithi were subjected to further evaluation



mhc stability studies using rmas kd cells
the peptides identified above using the bimas and syfpeithi algorithms were screened using a mhc stability assay. peptides were incubated with tap deficient rmas cells that expressed the class i molecule, kd. following an overnight incubation, kd was assessed in a flow-based assay. the mfi for the three peptides is shown in fig.  <dig>  all three peptides induced a significant increase in the mfi, as compared to the isotype control . p <dig> was 45 ±  <dig>  p <dig> was 19 ±  <dig>  and p <dig> was  <dig>  ±  <dig> .fig.  <dig> stabilization of kd expression in kd rmas cells by ebola gp <dig>  peptides. gp <dig>  ebola zaire, ncbi accession number aab <dig> , was analyzed by both bimas and syfpeithi. the gp <dig>  protein sequence was divided into segments of nine amino acid that overlapped by eight amino acids. peptides that scored better than > <dig> in bimas and > <dig> in syfpeithi were selected for further study. bd facs scan was used to assess peptide stabilization of mhc expressed on kd rmas cells. the heavy line represents isotype control. the results are representative of three independent experiments



these results suggest that p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> can stabilize the kd mhc. p <dig> originates from the highly variable and glycosylated region of gp <dig> . p <dig> is located in the conserved region of the tail that is responsible for injecting the virus into the cytoplasm. p <dig> is found in the conserved region that mediates gp <dig>  receptor binding to cellular receptors. the sites of these peptides are shown in fig.  <dig> and are overlaid on the gp <dig>  sequences for bundibugyo, tai forest, zaire, reston, sudan and marburg viruses.fig.  <dig> sequence alignment of gp <dig>  from ebola zaire , sudan virus , bundibugyo , tai forest , reston , and marburg lake victoria . clustal w alignments were performed and highlights were added via boxshade. amino acids that are identical are shaded black while chemically similar amino acids are grey. the location of peptides p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> are indicated by the boxes. p <dig> is in a highly variable region while p <dig> and p <dig> are located in highly conserved regions for cytosolic entry and cellular recognition, respectively



elispot analysis of peptides
an elispot for ifn-γ was used to assess the immunodominant potential of the peptides identified in the kd stability studies. to assess immunogenic potential, mice were immunized with p <dig>  p <dig> or p <dig> and an ifn-γ elispot was performed. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the p <dig> elispot response was less robust when compared to p <dig> and p <dig>  for p <dig>  the elispot response was concentration-dependent and the maximum response for the peptide was 100 μm.fig.  <dig> ifn-γ elispot responses by splenocytes were evaluated following immunization with ebola zaire gp <dig>  peptides. mice were immunized and boosted 7 days after initial immunization. splenocytes were re-stimulated in vitro with peptide overnight. the mean ifn- γ elispots/ <dig> splenocytes +/− the s.e. is presented. the results are representative of three independent experiments. asterisks indicate statistically significant ifn- γ increase in peptide-exposed cells at 100 mm concentration compared with those cells treated with  <dig>  mm peptide 



intracellular staining for ifn-γ
to clarify the cellular identity of ifn-γ secretions, intracellular staining  was performed using splenocytes from peptide immunized mice. a robust signal for ifn-γ was seen for all three peptides that were predominately in the cd8+ t-cells as shown in fig.  <dig>  in sum, the three peptides induced ifn-γ expression in cd8+ t-cells, which was around 2 % as compared to the control of  <dig>  %.fig.  <dig> induction of intracellular ifn- γ production following immunization with p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  splenocytes from peptide immunized animals were cultured for 24 h in vitro with respective peptide. cells were collected, washed, stained with cd3ε percp and anti-cd  <dig> fitc and fixed. the cells were further stained with anti-ifn-γ antibody and were analyzed using bd facs canto. the results are represented as mean +/− s.e. of three independent experiments. asterisks indicate statistically significant ifn-γ increase in peptide-exposed cells compared with those untreated cells 



tetramer analysis
to follow the development of ctl cells, tetramer reagents for kd mhc were generated for p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  mice were immunized with peptides as described above and splenocytes were prepared. splenocytes were stained with tetramer and counterstained with cd <dig> percp and cd <dig> fitc. the results are shown in fig.  <dig>  in the cd8+ t-cell gated population,  <dig>  % of cells were positive for p <dig> tetramer,  <dig>  % of cells were positive for p <dig> tetramer, and  <dig>  % of cells were positive for p <dig> tetramer. clearly, antigen specific cells can be induced by p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> and tetramers bound to splenocytes can be detected and amplified by sorting. next, cells were sorted on the basis of tetramer binding. the post-sort results are also shown in fig.  <dig>  the frequency of tetramer positive cells after sorting was increased to 48 % , 35 %  and 59 %  for p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  respectively.fig.  <dig> tetramer staining of immunized splencocytes. splenocytes from peptide immunized animals were stained with kd tetramers prepared with p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> or adjuvant . the cells were counter stained with cd <dig> fitc and cd <dig> percp, then fixed. the stained cells were analyzed in a facs aria. tetramer positive cells were sorted and re-analyzed. pre-sort and post sorted tetramer positive cells are shown in figure. the results are representative of three independent experiments



ctl analysis
finally, the ability of p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> to generate functional ctl was examined. a flow based assay was used to follow caspase  <dig> generation in kd targets. splenocytes from peptide immunized mice were re-stimulated in vitro with the corresponding peptides. kd targets were incubated overnight with peptides. the effector cells and targets were mixed and the caspase  <dig> expression was followed by flow cytometry as shown in fig.  <dig>  for all three peptides, caspase generation was seen that was dependent upon the e: t ratio. with all three peptides, significant killing was seen at e: t ratios of 1: <dig>   <dig> : <dig>   <dig> : <dig> and  <dig> : <dig>  the robust lysis implies that p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> may function in vivo as immunodominant epitopes.fig.  <dig> ctl response induced by peptides p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig>  splenocytes from immunized animals were cultured for 5 days in vitro with peptide, collected and counted. in parallel, kd cells were incubated overnight with p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> or adjuvant , washed and then labeled with ddao cell tracker. effector and target cells were mixed and incubated for 4 h in the indicated ratios and fixed. the cells were stained with anti-cleaved caspase- <dig> pe and analyzed by flow cytometry using a facs canto. the mean percentage of caspase positive kd cells +/− the se is presented. the results are representative of three independent experiments. asterisks indicate statistically significant increase in caspase - <dig> positive cells compared with those caspase positive cells in mock 



discussion
in the current study, several hundred ebola gp <dig>  zaire sequences were examined using in silico techniques. nanomers that scored higher than  <dig> on syfpeithi or  <dig> on bimas are shown in table  <dig>  the syfpeithi algorithm provides a score based upon the pattern of amino acid sequences that preferentially bind to the mhc. the bimas score is based on binding affinities of single amino acids of the peptide, with each amino acid weighted the same, thereby providing an overall affinity to mhc. following their synthesis, mhc stability was examined using kd expressing rmas cells. the peptides were p <dig>  eylfevdnl aa 231–240; p <dig>  lflrattel, aa 571– <dig> and p <dig>  lydrlastv aa 161– <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> are from regions that are highly conserved across species zaire mayinga, zaire kikwit, cote-d-ivoire, sudan boniface, sudan gulu, reston virginia and marburg popp  <cit> . p <dig>  <cit>  and p <dig>  have been previously reported as ctl epitopes in zaire ebov gp <dig> ; however we have performed immunological analysis of a immune-dominant p <dig> peptide, which has been submitted by kent et al. to http://www.iedb.org/epid/ <dig>  as shown in fig.  <dig>  all three stabilized expression of kd mhc, which is crucial for immunodominant epitopes.

elispot identifies cells secreting cytokines and has a limit of detection as low as 1: <dig>  <cit> . the elispot also provides a convenient means of estimating the frequencies of ifn-γ producing cells  <cit> . using a rabies vaccine expressing ebola virus glycoprotein, a strong elispot response was seen in mice using peptide pools of gp <dig>   <cit> . in the study, the peptides p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> induced ifn-γ release. however as shown in fig.  <dig>  in contrast to the kd stability studies, p <dig> elicited the greatest response followed by p <dig> and p <dig> 

as shown in fig.  <dig>  all three peptides induced ifn-γ in cd8+ t-cells, implying that these peptides may provide significant protection against ebola. lassa gp <dig>  peptide also elicited a ifn-γ signal in hla-a <dig>  transgenic mice  <cit> . the ics results were highly consistent with the elispot data.

class i tetramers permit the rapid assessment of antigen specific cd8+ t-cells which is essential in monitoring immune responses to infections as well as vaccine development  <cit> . tetramers can often detect antigen specific t-cells that are of low abundance and undetectable by functional studies such as elispot and ics . tetramers were developed for nucleoprotein epitopes of ebola zaire  <cit> . in this study, peptides p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> were used to generate class i tetramers . when mice were immunized with the peptides, a specific staining for each tetramer was observed as shown in fig.  <dig>  furthermore, we sorted the cells based upon tetramer staining which greatly amplified the detection of epitope specific cd8+ t-cell population. this demonstrates the utility of the tetramer reagents that will greatly assist in the ongoing studies using gp <dig>  from ebola zaire.

we have used a non-radioactive flow-based assay to detect apoptosis in peptide sensitized, ddao labeled kd rmas cells  <cit> . most importantly, the flow-based caspase  <dig> generation assay is 10– <dig> times more sensitive than the chromium release assay  <cit> . as shown in fig.  <dig>  we noted caspase  <dig> in ddao labeled targets at the low effector to target ratio of 1: <dig>  the caspase generation is a function of effector cell number and was reduced linearly for all three peptides as the number of effectors decreased. the caspase- <dig> expression shown in fig.  <dig> and the ifn-γ expression observed in ics staining as seen in fig.  <dig> were comparable and support each other. these results suggest that the peptides may play a significant role during vaccination and protection of ebola infection. the results from the present study are consistent with earlier studies  <cit> . in rao et al., the peptides p <dig> and p <dig> were identified using classical ctl assays to ebola zaire. both p <dig> and p <dig> were assessed using liposomes containing ebola zaire, though the e:t ratio used by rao et al. was much higher than used in the present experiments. ctl generated by peptides have also been demonstrated for ebola zaire np  <cit>  and lassa gp <dig>  peptides  <cit>  using a chromium release assay.

it has been shown that gp <dig>  can confer protection against mouse adapted ebola  <cit> . it would be of significant interest to determine the immunogenicity of p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  the immunodominant epitopes in gp <dig> . taking a step further, we have immunized balb/c mice with gp <dig> , the protein responsible for both cell mediated and humoral immunity. as shown in fig.  <dig>  all the peptides in our study specifically induce caspase- <dig> expression  in ddao-labeled target cells. fig.  <dig> shows induction of ifn-γ in cd8+ t-cells, when stimulated with peptides. this indicates that immunizing with an ebola virus glycoprotein, in a whole protein form, can potentially promote vaccine induced protective immunity. this experiment further confirms the immune-dominant potential of these peptides. recently, a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus based vaccine, expressing zaire-gp <dig>  was found to be 100 % successful in phase i trail in africa. hence, identifying immune-dominant peptide specific protective ctls in these protected vaccinees, using tetramer technology for human cd8+ t-cells, would aid in development of peptide-based vaccines against the deadly disease. additionally, we would also like to extend our studies to explore the cell-mediated responses in transgenic mice expressing mamu-a- <dig> transgene, a rhesus hla to ebola gp <dig> . the challenge is in extending promising rodent studies to non-human primates  <cit> .fig.  <dig> ctl response induced by gp <dig>  immunization. splenocytes from immunized animals were cultured for 5 days in vitro with p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> peptides, for the expansion of peptide specific ctls, that were collected and counted. in parallel, kd cells were incubated overnight with p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> or adjuvant , washed and then labeled with ddao cell tracker. effector and target cells were mixed and incubated for 4 h in the indicated ratios and fixed. the cells were then stained with anti-cleaved caspase- <dig> pe and analyzed by flow cytometers, using a facs canto. the mean percentage of caspase positive kd cells +/− the se is presented. the results are representative of three independent experiments. asterisks indicate statistically significant increase in caspase - <dig> positive cells compared with those caspase- <dig> positive cells in mock

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we have identified three immune-dominant kd epitopes of gp <dig>  using in silico methods and evaluated their immunogenicity through in vitro and in vivo assays. furthermore, we developed tetramers, which detect ebola specific t-cells. these tetramer reagents will significantly contribute in evaluating cell-mediated responses to infection and also in determining the efficacy of prospective vaccine candidates in the field of ebola vaccine research.
