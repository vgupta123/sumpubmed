BACKGROUND
reverse genetics is potentially a powerful strategy used to identify novel, induced mutations in candidate genes. utilizing reverse genetics allows us to take advantage of genes characterized in other plant genomes and use this knowledge to create a pool of candidate genes in soybean which can then be screened for genotypic variants. the function of the gene is further characterized by identifying predicted mutant phenotypes. alternatively this technique can be applied to genes with known function to create an allelic series to avoid possible lethality issues in genes essential for plant growth or development. the recent release of the soybean genome sequence is an especially valuable asset for soybean reverse genetics.

targeting induced local lesions in genomes  is a reverse genetics technique that serves as a high throughput method to identify unique, chemically induced mutations within target genes which have potential to change gene expression and/or function  <cit> . we developed two soybean tilling populations utilizing the chemical mutagen ethyl-methanesulfonate  as part of an effort to provide a resource to identify novel alleles of genes with a role in soybean seed composition traits  <cit> . chemical mutagenesis, either ems or nmu  typically induces single nucleotide polymorphisms; these point mutations are extremely useful both for studying gene function as well as for their potential use in crop improvement  <cit> . the mutants are generally characterized by knocked-down or altered gene function rather than a knock-out; for the populations used in this study, the previously characterized mutation distributions were  <dig> or 33% missense,  <dig> or 58% silent, and  <dig> or 8% truncation  <cit> .

previously, a number of techniques which were first proven in other crops have been applied to soybean functional genomics studies, but each strategy has obstacles in terms of efficiency, directness, timing, and regulatory issues. transformation of soybean with either agrobacterium tumefaciens or a. rhizogenes has been effective in studying gene function, although it is not very efficient  <cit>  and can be limited by genotype specificity  <cit> . directed co-suppression, overexpression of genes, and rnai have all been utilized to gain insights into gene function and produce desired phenotypes in transgenic soybeans  <cit> . while the use of transgenic technology is suitable for traits that can be utilized broadly for commodity soybeans, the current regulatory environment is prohibitive to extensive use of transgenic technology for many individual soybean traits.

the more traditional forward genetics approach relies on the identification of a mutant phenotype followed by the investigation of the causative gene. forward genetics screening has historically been a very valuable strategy to identify different sources of soybean traits. however, screening divergent germplasm or induced mutant populations may fail to deliver the desired phenotype when multiple genes are involved. in soybean, the genome functions as diploid, but it has undergone rounds of genome duplication that often results in functional genetic redundancy  <cit> .

the objective of this work was to take advantage of the availability of soybean candidate genes that were known to control seed composition traits as targets for the tilling reverse genetics strategy; the goal was to identify novel mutant alleles that could be characterized for desirable seed phenotypes. our targets were a raffinose synthase  and an omega- <dig> fatty acid desaturase  controlling seed oligosaccharide levels and oleic acid levels in the seed oil, respectively.

raffinose synthase catalyzes the biochemical reaction to produce raffinose from sucrose and galactinol. stachyose is formed in a stepwise reaction utilizing raffinose and galactinol as substrates. both raffinose and stachyose are indigestible by monogastric animals and are therefore considered anti-nutritional components of soybean meal. previously, the pi  <dig> allele of rs <dig> was associated with the increased sucrose and low raffinose and stachyose seed phenotype  <cit> .

in addition to the targeted raffinose synthase candidate gene, we screened for novel mutant alleles of the soybean seed-expressed omega- <dig> fatty acid desaturase gene fad2-1a. this fatty acid desaturase catalyzes the conversion of oleic acid precursors into linoleic acid precursors that accumulate in the seed oil  <cit> . mutations in fad2-1a have been recovered previously using a forward genetics strategy, and result in an increase in oleic acid levels and a decrease in linoleic acid levels, a phenotype desirable for cooking and industrial oils. the elevated oleic acid soybean line m <dig> was induced by x-ray mutagenesis and has been shown to have a genomic deletion that includes the fad2-1a gene; a second elevated oleic acid soybean line contained a single base deletion in the fad2-1a gene  <cit> . cooking oil is in demand that contains elevated oleic acid and decreased linolenic acid. although the genetic combining ability for mutant alleles of the fad2-1a gene and microsomal omega- <dig> fatty acid desaturase  genes has been reported, the exact relationship between increased oleic acid levels and decreased linolenic acid levels has not been clearly defined . the oleic acid level in soybean seed oil has been demonstrated to be very sensitive to the environment  <cit> , which has complicated the identification and analysis of elevated oleic acid soybean lines.

RESULTS
identification of soybean raffinose synthase  mutant alleles
previously, mutations in the soybean raffinose synthase gene, rs <dig>  have been shown to result in an increase in seed sucrose and a decrease in raffinose and stachyose  <cit> . reverse genetics screening of the ems mutagenized populations created the potential to find additional mutations in rs <dig> and confirm the contribution of this gene to the seed oligosaccharide phenotype in soybean. a portion of the rs <dig> gene  was screened for mutations utilizing the tilling strategy  <cit> ; four lines were identified which contained single nucleotide polymorphisms . these lines were subsequently confirmed by sequence analysis to contain independent rs <dig> mutations. the four identified lines all contained a snp typical of ems mutagenesis, g/c to a/t transitions. two of the mutations did not result in amino acid changes and therefore were not considered candidates for phenotypic characterization. the other two lines, designated  <dig> and  <dig>  contained mutations which resulted in missense amino acid changes  <cit> .

dna from m <dig> tissue of line  <dig> contained a homozygous snp  resulting in s150f amino acid change. dna from m <dig> tissue of line  <dig> contained a heterozygous snp  resulting in a t107i amino acid change. the induced mutations in both line  <dig> and  <dig> lie in semi-conserved regions of plant raffinose synthase gene sequences . m <dig> seedlings from lines  <dig> and  <dig> were characterized for the rs <dig> alleles, and the homozygous and segregating nature of the identified mutant alleles was confirmed, respectively.

identification of omega- <dig> fatty acid desaturase fad2-1a mutant alleles
mutations in the soybean omega- <dig> fatty acid desaturase gene fad2-1a have been shown to elevate oleic acid content of the seed oil  <cit> . therefore, one of our main targets was to identify variant alleles of the fad2-1a gene present in the tilling populations. primers were designed to specifically amplify and interrogate the fad2-1a sequences present in the mutant populations, and three individual lines were identified; these lines were subsequently confirmed by sequence analysis to contain independent fad2-1a mutations.

the fad2-1a mutations identified in dna from m <dig> tissue were homozygous in all three cases, and the mutations were confirmed in the m <dig> seedlings corresponding to the original m <dig> plants. line 17d contained a snp  resulting in the amino acid change s117n. line  <dig> contained a snp  resulting in the amino acid change s238f. line  <dig> contained a snp  resulting in the amino acid change g374e. the missense mutation for line 17d was in a highly conserved region of the protein sequence, while the missense mutations in lines  <dig> and  <dig> were in less conserved regions  <cit> .

oligosaccharide content phenotype of rs <dig> induced mutants
seeds from the homozygous s150f line  <dig> did not have an obvious oligosaccharide phenotype as determined by quantitatively measuring sucrose, raffinose and stachyose of m <dig> seeds and comparing them to wild-type seeds . however, the line  <dig> harboring the t107i rs <dig> allele displayed a phenotype predicted for mutations in the soybean raffinose synthase gene rs <dig> 

taking advantage of the heterozygous state of the induced mutation in line  <dig>  we investigated the inheritance of this novel allele and its subsequent effect on seed oligosaccharide content by screening thirty-seven individual m <dig> seeds for both oligosaccharide phenotype and rs <dig> genotype . seeds were chipped into two approximately equal pieces, one was used for single seed oligosaccharide phenotype analysis and the remaining portion containing the embryo was germinated and genotyped by the developed allele specific molecular marker assay. the genotype/phenotype association results on m <dig> seeds reveal an increase in sucrose along with decreases in raffinose and stachyose content when seeds were homozygous for the mutant rs <dig> allele . furthermore, one wild-type allele of rs <dig> was sufficient to produce the wild-type oligosaccharide seed phenotype, which is consistent with previous results   <cit> .

a population consisting of plants with contrasting rs <dig> genotypes was then developed from line 397-derived plants that contained either homozygous wild-type  or homozygous mutant alleles at the rs <dig> locus in order to further characterize the phenotype resulting from the novel allele. seven independent wild-type rs <dig> and nine independent mutant rs <dig> plants were selected to negate the action of unidentified genes that may contribute to the oligosaccharide content; the mutation density was previously determined to average 1/ <dig> kilobases  <cit> . four seeds from each of the plants of the homozygous population were analyzed for oligosaccharide content. for the plants that contained the t107i rs <dig> mutation, the average seed sucrose was increased by 28%, raffinose was reduced to 37% and stachyose was reduced to approximately 24% of 397-derived seeds which carried the wild-type allele of rs <dig> . this oligosaccharide phenotype is similar to the phenotype controlled by the previously described rs <dig> mutant alleles in pi  <dig> which also resulted in a decrease in seed raffinose and stachyose content along with an increase in seed sucrose levels  <cit> .

in all cases where rs <dig> was homozygous mutant, a statistically significant difference in the ratio of sucrose to the sum of raffinose and stachyose was observed when compared to seeds with either rs <dig> homozygous wild-type or heterozygous alleles. the absolute ratios observed in the homozygous classes were significantly different between the segregating seed samples  and the homozygous plants analyzed ; a higher mean ratio was observed for the field grown seeds compared to the seeds produced in the growth chamber.

fatty acid phenotype of fad2-1a mutants
the expected phenotype for soybeans containing mutations in fad2-1a is an increase in the oleic acid content of the seed oil with a concomitant decrease in linoleic acid. since the mutant lines were homozygous for the mutations, all three lines were grown two years in a field environment along with lines that contained wild-type or mutant alleles of fad2-1a, fad3a and fad3c to produce seeds for fatty acid analysis. lines  <dig> and  <dig> did not produce significantly different oleic acid levels from the progenitor line 'williams 82'  <cit>  and were only grown in  <dig> . oleic acid levels for line 17d containing homozygous fad2-1a s117n mutant alleles were significantly higher than those for williams  <dig> . the mean oleic acid level for the seeds containing homozygous fad2-1a 17d mutant alleles was lower than the mean oleic acid level for two independent lines which possess a null fad2-1a allele . the results were similar for the experiments performed in  <dig> and  <dig>  although there was a trend for higher oleic acid levels in  <dig> for the lines containing fad2-1a mutations.

the inheritance of the s117n mutant fad2-1a allele from line 17d and the fatty acid phenotype was evaluated in selected homozygous progeny derived from a cross of williams  <dig> with line 17d. molecular marker assays specific for the s117n mutant fad2-1a allele from 17d were designed and validated. six independent f <dig> plants homozygous for the 17d mutant alleles and five independent homozygous wild-type plants were grown to produce seed in a field environment. fatty acid analysis on the resulting f <dig> seeds demonstrated significantly higher mean oleic acid levels for those seeds which were homozygous for the mutant s117n allele of fad2-1a . the mean linoleic acid level for the fad2-1a mutant seeds was significantly lower than the wild-type fad2-1a seeds. overall, the significant change in oleic acid content and the concomitant decrease in linoleic acid content is consistent with the s117n alleles of fad2-1a responsible for disrupting at least part of the seed expressed omega- <dig> fatty acid desaturase enzymatic capacity.

discussion
here we demonstrate the utility of the tilling reverse genetics strategy in identifying novel soybean lines containing desirable seed traits. the targeted raffinose synthase and omega- <dig> fatty acid desaturase genes were chosen based on previous research revealing their involvement in seed oligosaccharide content and oleic acid levels, respectively. for both genes, multiple variant alleles were identified, and one line containing mutant alleles of each of the genes produced the predicted phenotype. the phenotypes were confirmed to be dependent on the inheritance of the mutant alleles. because the roles of the candidate genes were confirmed, the developed molecular marker assays enable direct selection for the mutant allele in the heterozygous state, when the phenotype would not otherwise be apparent. seed mutagenesis and reverse genetics are not transgenic technologies, so soybean varieties that incorporate mutant alleles identified by tilling are conventional lines which are not subject to any regulatory restrictions. soybean traits identified by tilling can be rapidly incorporated into elite soybean cultivars and released to producers.

the identification of an induced mutation in rs <dig> serves as an additional confirmation of the contribution of this gene to the seed raffinose and stachyose content  <cit> . similar to the pi  <dig> mutant allele of rs <dig>  the mutagenized line  <dig> has reduced raffinose and stachyose as well as an increase in seed sucrose content. since similar phenotypes resulted from two independent mutations in rs <dig>  it may indicate that the mutations in the gene are deleterious to enzyme function and the detected raffinose in these lines is the result of one or more additional soybean raffinose synthase genes. it appears that inheritance of a single wild-type allele of rs <dig> is sufficient for a wild-type oligosaccharide seed phenotype, which is consistent with previously characterized rs <dig> alleles  <cit> .

soybean seed oligosaccharide content appears to be controlled mainly by the rs <dig> gene. however, both raffinose and stachyose are still present in lines containing rs <dig> mutants, suggesting that additional raffinose synthase enzyme activity remains during seed development. other candidate raffinose synthase genes have been identified, but variant alleles have not been confirmed to be associated with altered oligosaccharide content. it is possible that combining an rs <dig> mutation with variant alleles of other raffinose synthases may reveal epistatic interactions that would otherwise have been masked by a wild-type version of rs <dig> 

the novel s117n allele of fad2-1a appears to be deleterious to enzyme function since oleic acid accumulates to significantly higher levels in the seed oil in lines homozygous for the mutation when compared to related lines containing wild-type fad2-1a. since the environment has been shown to have an effect on oleic acid content, it was not surprising that the standard deviations were high for oleic acid content for the investigated fad2-1a mutant tilling line 17d and the fad2-1a deletion lines m <dig> and kb05- <dig>  <cit> . the observed differences in means with overlapping standard deviations for oleic acid phenotypes and the differences in relative maturity among the tilling mutant line with the novel fad2-1a alleles and the fad2-1a deletion lines m <dig> and kb05- <dig> indicates more research will be necessary to clarify the extent of the phenotypic consequences of the fad2-1a s117n substitution. nevertheless, this novel fad2-1a mutant allele provides an additional resource to investigate the agronomic impact of the elevated oleic acid trait in soybeans and an independent confirmation of the contribution of the fad2-1a gene to oleic acid accumulation in soybean seeds.

convincing evidence exists that points to genetic redundancy playing a role in oleic acid accumulation. although the identification of independent fad2-1a alleles has demonstrated a role for the gene in oleic acid accumulation, the residual omega- <dig> fatty acid desaturase activity that allows the production of linoleic and linolenic acids may be encoded by one other closely related gene  which has been shown to be expressed in soybean seeds or the fad2- <dig> gene family members members  <cit> . a reverse genetics strategy is particularly amenable to dissection of desirable phenotypes where genetic redundancy may complicate a forward genetics strategy.

CONCLUSIONS
the use of tilling to identify novel sources of important soybean seed composition traits confirms the utility of this reverse genetics technology as a route for both gene function analysis and direct applicability for soybean improvement. soybean now joins wheat, sorghum, pea, and rapeseed as crops that have demonstrated success in identifying traits using tilling for reverse genetics  <cit> .
