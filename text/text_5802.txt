BACKGROUND
the steroid receptor coactivator  <dig>   is a member of the src family of proteins which bind to nuclear hormone receptors, and other transcription factors, to promote coactivator complex assembly at target genes  <cit> . this is accomplished through direct protein interactions mediated by several structural domains conserved among all of the src family members. these domains include a basic helix-loop-helix per/arnt/sim  domain, a nuclear receptor interacting domain which consists of three leucine-rich motifs with the consensus amino acid sequence lxxll , and two transcriptional activation domains  within the carboxy terminus of src <dig>  the ad <dig> domain interacts directly with various protein acetyltransferases such as cbp/p <dig>  or p/caf/gcn <dig> and is absolutely essential for src3-mediated transcriptional activation  <cit> . a second transactivation domain  serves as an interaction surface for several members of the protein arginine methyltransferase  class of enzymes such as the coactivator associated arginine methyltransferase  <dig>  and prmt <dig>  <cit> . carm <dig> interacts directly with the ad <dig> domain of all the src proteins and co-transfection assays using transient or stably integrated reporter genes have shown that individual src proteins can synergize with p/300/cbp and carm <dig> suggesting that the coordinated recruitment of acetyltransferases and methyltransferases by src <dig> may be complimentary to one another and represent essential activating steps in nuclear receptor-dependent gene transcription  <cit> .

src <dig> function is also regulated by multiple cytoplasmic signalling events. recent studies have identified numerous post-translational modifications within src <dig> such as phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination and methylation  <cit> . consequently, the type and specific sites of covalent modifications in src <dig> determine the affinity for the liganded-nr, as well the association with different coactivating partners, resulting in the formation of diverse multimeric complexes which are believed to regulate distinct gene expression programs.

src <dig> is located within a region of chromosome  <dig> that is often amplified in breast and ovarian cancer  <cit> . several studies have confirmed that src <dig> is amplified in a significant fraction of breast tumours, with amplification frequencies of approximately 10%  <cit> . a positive correlation has also been found between amplification of src <dig> and increased expression of the her <dig> oncogene  <cit> . patients whose tumours expressed high levels of both p/cip and her- <dig> exhibited the poorest survival rates and the worst responses to tamoxifen therapy. in mcf- <dig> cells, downregulation of src <dig> using small interfering rna  decreased βestradiol-dependent cell proliferation and inhibited expression of several erα targets  <cit> . importantly, decreased expression of src <dig> in mcf- <dig> cells is associated with a significant reduction in estrogen-dependent colony formation and tumour growth in nude mice  <cit> . collectively, these results suggest that src <dig> is required for maximum er activation, and amplification and overexpression of src <dig> is a contributing factor that promotes er-dependent signalling in the mammary gland and in breast cancer. transgenic mice overexpressing src <dig> under the control of the mmtv promoter have provided further evidence for its oncogenic capacity  <cit> . the mammary glands of src <dig> transgenic mice were associated with increases in cell proliferation, reduced apoptosis and a high tumour incidence. furthermore, increases in igf-i mrna levels and activation of igf/akt/mtor signalling pathway were also found in the mammary gland tumours.

in the present study, we purified src <dig> from hela cell nuclear extracts and using mass spectrometry, we have identified the dna damage response protein 53bp <dig> as a novel src3-associated protein. the colocalization of src <dig> and 53bp <dig> also included cbp based on copurification, and was restricted to the nuclear compartment. colocalization of src <dig> and 53bp <dig> was not dependent on dna damage suggesting that src <dig> likely plays no direct role in the dna damage response. however, using both chromatin immunorecipitation  and sirna knockdown, we have determined that src <dig> and 53bp <dig> co-occupy the same region of the brca <dig> promoter and are both required for brca <dig> expression in hela cells. these results suggest that the 53bp1/src <dig> complex may play a role in modulating the dna damage response by regulating the expression of a subset of target genes important for dna repair.

RESULTS
to purify src3-associated proteins we combined conventional and immunoaffinity chromatography using an αsrc <dig> antibody  <cit>  . hela cell nuclear extracts were prepared and fractionated on a p <dig> phosphocellulose column using a buffer containing increasing salt concentrations. western blot analysis of the eluates derived from the p <dig> column indicated that src <dig> eluted in buffer containing  <dig>  m kcl . the src3-containing fraction was then subjected to further purification using gel filtration chromatography followed by affinity purification using an α src <dig> antibody crosslinked to protein a sepharose . sds-page analysis followed by silver staining detected several other proteins ranging in molecular weight from  <dig> to  <dig> kda . the identity of src3-associated proteins was found to vary between different purifications with the exception of the band migrating at approximately  <dig> kda which was consistently observed in all of the independent purifications performed and was identified by mass spectrometry as the dna damage response protein p <dig> binding protein  <dig> . to confirm our mass spectrometry findings, western blotting was performed using various antibodies which demonstrated that src <dig>  53bp <dig> and the src3-interacting protein creb binding protein  were specifically retained by the αsrc <dig> affinity column .

to further confirm the association between src <dig> and 53bp <dig>  the purification protocol shown in figure 1a was repeated using α53bp <dig> affinity column in place of the αsrc <dig> affinity column. fractionation of hela cell nuclear extracts by phosphocellulose chromatography demonstrated that 53bp <dig> was found in both the  <dig>  m and  <dig>  m salt fractions suggesting that 53bp <dig> may be found as a constituent of other protein complexes . the  <dig>  m kcl fraction, containing both src <dig> and 53bp <dig>  was then subjected to further purification using gel filtration chromatography. elution from the gel filtration column indicated that 53bp <dig> migrated with an estimated molecular mass of approximately to  <dig> to  <dig> mda and partially overlapped with the elution profile of src <dig>  the fractions containing both 53bp <dig> and src <dig> were pooled and purified by affinity chromatography using the α53bp <dig> antibody crosslinked to protein a sepharose. western blotting of the affinity purified fractions using specific antibodies demonstrated that this 53bp <dig> fraction also contained src <dig> and cbp confirming that they are most likely found in the same complex . to determine if 53bp <dig> was able to interact directly with src <dig>  deletion mutants of various region of 53bp <dig> were generated by in vitro transcription and translation with -methionine and tested for interaction with purified recombinant src <dig> . these experiments indicated that the carboxy terminus of 53bp <dig>  containing the brct domains, interacted with full length src <dig>  and a weaker interaction was detected with the region corresponding to . these results suggest that the carboxy terminus of 53bp <dig> makes direct contact with full length src <dig> 

numerous studies have established that the primary function of 53bp <dig> is in dna damage response. when cells are exposed to agents which induce dna double stranded breaks such as etoposide, 53bp <dig> rapidly relocalizes to discrete foci within the nucleus  <cit> . to define the potential role of the src <dig> in the dna-damage response pathway, we investigated the effects of dna damage on the localization of src <dig>  for these experiments, hela cells were treated with etoposide for  <dig> minutes, and the cells were allowed to recover, fixed and stained for either src <dig> or 53bp <dig>  as shown in figure 4a, in asynchronously proliferating hela cells both src <dig> and 53bp <dig> appear to be homogenously distributed throughout the nucleus. upon treatment with  <dig> nm etoposide for  <dig> minutes, 53bp <dig> becomes localized to discrete foci. in contrast, the distribution of src <dig> remained unchanged when comparing the etoposide treated cells to the control cells. distribution was also examined following gamma irradiation which again demonstrated that 53bp <dig> becomes localized to multiple foci whereas the distribution of src <dig> in the nucleus was homogenous . interestingly, some colocalization was evident at the 53bp1-containing foci when the images are merged. however, we believe that this is most likely not the result of an src <dig> response to the dna damage because we did not observe any redistribution of src following treatment with etoposide. furthermore, immunoaffinity purification of src <dig> indicated that 53bp <dig> copurifies with src <dig> regardless of whether the dna had been damaged . we also examined a potential regulatory role of src <dig> in the 53bp1-dependent response to etoposide following src <dig> knockdown. src <dig> levels were downregulated using sirna and cells were treated with etoposide for  <dig> minutes then allowed to recover for various periods of time and foci formation were again monitored. foci formation was clearly evident  <dig> minutes after etoposide treatment and the number of foci decreased in a time-dependent fashion . importantly, src <dig> knockdown using sirna had no significant effect on the rate of recovery following etoposide treatment . these results suggest that src <dig> is most likely not involved in the initial response to dna damage.

the lack of effect of src <dig> in the dna damage response following etoposide treatment prompted us to examine whether the association between src <dig> and 53bp <dig> may be important for gene regulation. recent studies have shown that a 53bp1-containing complex binds to an imperfect palindromic sequence found in the brca <dig> minimal promoter, and depletion of 53bp <dig> using sirna suppresses both the activity of a reporter containing the minimal promoter and brca <dig> expression  <cit> . to determine if 53bp <dig> and src <dig> bind to a similar region of the brca <dig> promoter, we performed chip analysis in hela cells . both src <dig> and 53bp <dig> are enriched within the proximal promoter that contains the 53bp <dig> binding site described previously  <cit> . finally, to assess if src <dig> or 53bp <dig> regulate brca <dig> protein expression, we used sirna to knockdown src <dig> or 53bp <dig> in hela cells. as shown in figure  <dig>  knockdown of 53bp <dig> or src <dig> resulted in significant decreases in brca <dig> protein levels suggesting that both proteins are required for expression of the brca <dig> gene. collectively, these results suggest that the association between src3/53bp <dig> may represent a functional complex involved in transcriptional regulation of specific genes involved in dna repair.

discussion
in the present study we have identified the tumour suppressor 53bp <dig> as a novel constituent of an src <dig> complex that also includes the protein acetyltransferase cbp. silver staining of the affinity purified src <dig> complex detected at least  <dig> additional proteins; although the reproducibility of many of the purified proteins was not always consistent, they did not coelute from control antibody affinity columns. therefore, we believe that they may play a complimentary role to src <dig> in response to specific stimuli. src <dig> belongs to the src family of proteins which function primarily as adaptor proteins involved in the recruitment and stabilization of protein complexes to upstream regulatory regions. immunoaffinity chromatography has previously been used to identify a number of src-interacting proteins that include protein kinases, chromatin modifying proteins such as cbp/p <dig> as well as additional adaptor proteins  <cit> . while 53bp <dig> has not been previously identified as a src3-associated protein, many of the previous studies have used immunoaffinity purification using antibodies raised against different epitopes of src <dig>  <cit> . consequently, it is conceivable that a specific protein-antibody interaction could result in masking specific interaction domains, or disrupt specific interactions, resulting in the purification of a different repertoire of interacting proteins.

targeting protein acetyltransferases to specific sites in the genome has been shown to play an important role in double strand breaks  repair. the trap and tip <dig> histone acetyltransferases are recruited to dsb and are required for h <dig> acetylation as well as the recruitment of additional dsb mediators including 53bp <dig>  <cit> . more recently, both cbp and p <dig> have been shown to play an important role in acetylation of histone h <dig> and h <dig> at dsb sites during non homologous end joining  which in turn facilitates recruitment of the swi/snf complex and consequently causing the chromatin to assume a more relaxed conformation  <cit> . interestingly, both cbp and p <dig> have been found to associate with proteins involved in dna repair and dna damage response pathways, including 53bp <dig>  suggesting that chromatin modification is a necessary prerequisite for the maintenance of genome integrity  <cit> . finally, recent studies have implicated 53bp <dig> in nhej and v9j recombination through a mechanism involving changes in chromatin mobility  <cit> .

based on our fractionation studies using 53bp <dig> antibody, 53bp <dig> consistently cofractionated into  <dig> distinct protein complexes following p <dig> chromatography. one complex eluted at a lower salt concentration contained both src <dig> and cbp, and a second complex which eluted at a higher salt concentration and does not contain src <dig> . 53bp <dig> was first identified in a screen for p53-interacting proteins and was initially characterized as a coactivator of p53-dependent transcription  <cit> . 53bp <dig> contains tandem c-terminal brct motifs. although the exact function of 53bp <dig> remains somewhat ambiguous it is believed to act as a scaffold or adaptor protein that coordinates dna repair by facilitating recruitment of additional proteins required in the dna repair process  <cit> . mice deficient in 53bp <dig> exhibit a number of pleiotropic abnormalities including growth and immune deficiencies, extreme sensitivity to radiation and are cancer prone  <cit> . importantly, cells from 53bp1-deficient mice exhibit intrinsic defects in genomic stability indicating that 53bp <dig> is a tumour suppressor protein  <cit> . when cells are exposed to genotoxic insults that cause dna double stranded breaks, 53bp <dig> becomes localized to discrete nuclear foci which appear with varying degrees of rapidity and colocalize, in part, with other known components of the dna damage response pathway  <cit> . the region of 53bp <dig> required for focal recruitment has been mapped to amino acids 1220- <dig> and encompasses tandem tudor domains. the tudor domain has been shown to interact with methylated lysines and arginines and suggests that recruitment of 53bp <dig> to chromatin during dsb may proceed through multiple histone modifications  <cit> . for example the tudor domain of 53bp <dig> has been shown to interact with dimethylated h3k <dig> and h4k <dig> and studies have demonstrated a prerequisite for h3k <dig> dimethylation in the dna damage response  <cit> . interestingly, src <dig> is methylated by carm <dig> in vivo and in vitro <cit> . however, the region of 53bp <dig> that interacts with src <dig> contains the brct domains, not the tudor domains so it is unlikely that the association between 53bp <dig> and src <dig> is methylation dependent.

we did not find any evidence for a direct role for src <dig> in the dna damage response, based on immunoflourescence analysis. while 53bp <dig> clearly relocalized to discrete foci in response to etoposide treatment, the distribution of src <dig> remained ubiquitous although some colocalization was observed within the foci following treatment with γ irradiation. furthermore, knockdown of src <dig> using sirna had no significant effect on the recovery rate following short term treatment with etoposide. while we cannot fully exclude a role for src <dig>  based on this assay we believe that src <dig> is unlikely to play a direct role in the initial response to dna damage. however, we have not examined other dsb mechanisms such as nhej  <cit> . in addition, there may be a level of redundancy with other src proteins which may compensate for any effect src <dig> may have in dna damage response.

our data suggests that 53bp <dig> plays a role in gene regulation and that the association between src <dig> and 53bp <dig> may be important for modulating the transcriptional response of the brca <dig> gene. a recent study has provided supporting evidence for this mechanism as 53bp <dig> may directly regulate gene transcription by targeting the brca <dig> promoter  <cit> . in vitro gel shift analysis has demonstrated that a 53bp1-containing complex binds to a consensus binding site found within the proximal promoter region of brca <dig> and chip analysis has shown that 53bp <dig> is targeted to the brca <dig> promoter  <cit> . furthermore, depletion of endogenous 53bp <dig> in u2os cells is associated with decreased brca <dig> mrna and protein expression  <cit> . we have shown in hela cells that both 53bp <dig> and src <dig> are found within the same approximate region of the brca <dig> promoter based on chip analysis. importantly, downregulation of src <dig> or 53bp <dig> resulted in a similar loss of brca <dig> expression in hela cells.

the brca <dig> gene is a tumour suppressor that plays an essential role in multiple functions including dna repair and transcriptional regulation and is regulated by a complex network of dna binding proteins and coactivators  <cit> . germline mutations in brca <dig> are relatively rare in sporadic forms of breast cancer although deregulation in brca <dig> expression is common  <cit> . in the majority of these cases the brca <dig> promoter is not hypermethylated suggesting that altered transcriptional regulation of the brca <dig> gene may play a causal role in this type of cancer. upregulation of brca <dig> expression has also been shown to occur in response to 17β-estradiol in various breast cancer cell lines and in overectimized mice  <cit> , and brca <dig> levels increase during puberty and pregnancy when estradiol levels peak  <cit> . furthermore, treatment of mcf <dig> breast cancer cells with 17β-estradiol results in recruitment of erα and p <dig> to the brca <dig> promoter that is, in part, mediated by ap <dig>  <cit> . it is well established that src <dig> interacts with both the ligand-bound er and p <dig> with high affinity  <cit> . thus, while we have not mapped the brca <dig> binding sites in detail, it is conceivable that in some cell types src <dig> and 53bp <dig> are recruited to the brca <dig> promoter as part of a larger complex involving the er and as well as other transcription factors.

although the biological significance of our findings remains to be elucidated, brca <dig> expression is regulated in a cell cycle dependent manner with the induction of brca <dig> peaking before the onset of dna replication  <cit> . consequently increases in brca <dig> expression resulting from src <dig> overexpression in some breast cancers may lead to aberrant activation of s-phase checkpoint proteins such as p <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
src <dig> and 53bp <dig> are part of a complex which targets the brca <dig> gene promoter. furthermore, both src <dig> and 53bp <dig> are required for brca <dig> expression suggesting that the src3/53bp <dig> complex plays a role in dna damage by regulating the activity of a subset of target genes involved in dna repair.
