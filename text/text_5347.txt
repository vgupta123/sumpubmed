BACKGROUND
the preservation of living cells has both theoretical and practical importance for human medicine, as well as for veterinary practice, cattle breeding, and plant cultivation  <cit> . the maintenance of intact living cells is necessary to preserve the cells' biological, biochemical, and functional properties as well as structural integrity, especially in rare and pedigree species. of special interest is the preservation of definite sets of cells carrying specific antigens as well as stem cells. such preservation opens wide possibilities for personalized therapy and for the development of innovative strategies for treating severe diseases, such as diabetes, nervous and cardio-vascular diseases, as well as various types of tumors  <cit> .

the effects of freezing and thawing on the biophysical and biochemical features of living cells can result in alteration of their functional competency and survival  <cit> . recently, numerous research groups have endeavored to optimize the procedure of freezing and thawing and to develop new cryopreservative media and instruments in order to minimize the damage caused by the freezing - thawing cycle  and to improve cell survival  <cit> . however, the ability to evaluate cell vitality potential, proliferation, and functional activity before and after cryopreservation is still limited.

we have recently introduced a novel device: the individual-cell-based cryo-chip  for the cryopreservation, manipulation and observation of spatially identifiable cells  <cit> . the aim of the present study is to evaluate the fate of cryopreserved cells in the device and to develop an approach for the efficient detection of viable, specific, highly biologically active cells for future applications. the results showed that u <dig> cells, after being thawed, have the same functional activities as non-frozen cells, confirming their biological integrity. moreover, quantitative image analysis at the resolution of individual cells facilitated the detection of unique, bioactive single cells or cell groups, within heterogeneous cell populations.

methods
the individual-cell-based cryo-chip 
the i3c is a configured micro-fluidics slide device, based on our previous work  <cit> . a detailed description of its mechanical and methodological aspects has been recently reported  <cit> . briefly, the i3c is designed for holding individual cells or individual cell groups throughout cryopreservation, manipulation, and observation. the active area is a  <dig>  μl chamber with a bottom which is made of densely packed transparent hexagonal matrix arrays of micron-sized wells . the high optical quality of the picowells enables high content image analysis of the cells maintained in the picowells, during their bio-manipulation, at an individual cell resolution.

biomaterials and probes
propidium iodide  and dimethyl sulphoxide  were obtained from sigma-aldrich . annexin v - fitc apoptosis detection kit was obtained from biovision inc. . fluorescein diacetate  was purchased from sigma-riedel-de-haen . tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester perchlorate  was obtained from molecular probes . rpmi- <dig> medium, heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine, sodium pyruvate and hepes  were obtained from biological industries .

cells and culture media
human pro-monocytic u <dig> cells  were maintained in rpmi- <dig> medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum ,  <dig> u/ml penicillin,  <dig> μg/ml streptomycin, 2% glutamine, 2% sodium pyruvate and 2% hepes. cells were maintained in completely humidified air with 5% co <dig> at 37°c. before use, exponentially growing cells were obtained, washed, and resuspended in pbs at a concentration of  <dig> - <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/ml. for post-thawing cell maintenance, the complete medium was supplemented by 20% fcs. the freezing - thawing cycle was performed in a cryo-protective medium supplemented by 20% fcs and 10% me2so.

experimental scheme
u <dig> cells at a concentration of  <dig> - <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/ml underwent the freezing - thawing cycle in the i3c , in standard cryo-vials , or in mini-vials . the mini-vials were used as an additional control to test the effect of the cell suspension volume on the cryopreservation process. in order to avoid a potential diversity of results due to different cell concentrations, additional control samples were exposed to the freezing - thawing cycle in standard cryo-vials, using a regular cell concentration of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml.

in order to equalize the post-thawing experimental conditions, control samples , were loaded into the i3c after the freezing - thawing cycle. from that point onward, the cells that were cryopreserved in the i3c and in the cryo-vial experienced the same experimental and measurement conditions.

for cell division experiments, control samples  were transferred immediately after thawing to  <dig> ml fresh enriched medium in culture flasks. untreated u <dig> cells were cultured in standard conditions as described above.

two types of i3c were used in this study:  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm pitched. the former were used for single cell maintenance, while the latter were used for maintaining groups of cells in a single picowell.

cell loading
cell loading into the i3c, whether for experimental samples or control samples, was carried out as follows:  <dig> μl of cell suspension  either in pbs or cryo-medium, was poured into the cell chamber and left for 7- <dig> min for cell sedimentation onto the picowell-padded bottom of the chamber. next,  <dig>  μl of supernatant medium was removed from the top of the suspension drop and the glass cover was closed, allowing for the introduction of a new medium portion  between the cover slip and the cell array conduit. the cell suspension in pbs was used for loading experimental samples into the i3c. after cell sedimentation, pbs was exchanged with the cryo-medium and the freezing - thawing cycle was started. for post-thawing loading of u <dig> cells from control cryo-devices, the cell suspension in the cryo-medium was loaded into the i3c as described above. accordingly, the cryopreserved medium was exchanged with fresh complete medium.

the freezing - thawing cycle 
experimental samples  and control cryo mini-vials underwent the freezing - thawing cycle either in a cryo-microscope or in a nalgene cryo 1°c freezing container . an epifluorescence microscope  which was modified to include a cryostage  cooled with liquid nitrogen and heated with an electric heating wire was used. the cooling and heating rates were fully controlled by a tp <dig> controller. after  <dig> min of pre-cooling at 4°c, the freezing procedure was initiated and the samples underwent slow freezing at a rate of 1°c per minute. the freezing end point was -80°c. the control samples in standard cryo-vials were frozen in a nalgene cryo 1°c freezing container at the rate of about 1°c per minute until reaching -80°c in the revco refrigerator . samples were stored at-80°c for at least  <dig> min  and up to  <dig> days in the freezing container.

for long term storage under extremely low temperature conditions, the samples were transferred into liquid nitrogen after -80°c was reached. samples were kept in liquid nitrogen  for at least  <dig> days.

thawing was performed as quickly as possible. within the cryostage, the thawing of samples stored either in the i3c or in cryo mini-vials was always performed controllably: the heating rates were set between 40°c and 30°c per minute. the thawing of samples that were frozen in a standard nalgene cryo 1°c freezing container was conducted by placing the frozen sample in an incubator at 37°c for  <dig> minutes. on the average, the latter procedure quite reliably imitates the thawing conditions within the cryostage, as the temperature of the frozen sample is elevated from-80° to +37° in  <dig> minutes.

post-thawing culturing and staining
following the freezing - thawing cycle, the cryo-medium was immediately exchanged with pre-warmed complete medium supplemented with 20% fcs. u <dig> cells were incubated in completely humidified air at 37°c with 5% co <dig> for  <dig>  hours,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours. cell staining was performed according to the protocols described below.

apoptosis screening after the freezing - thawing cycle
the early apoptotic events and cell viability were determined by double staining with an annexin v and pi kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. u <dig> cells were washed with binding buffer and then fitc-annexin v and pi were added as described in the instructions. following  <dig> min incubation in the dark at rt, cells were evaluated by fluorescent microscope at two wavelengths.

cell proliferation after the freezing - thawing cycle
for cell proliferation experiments, the i3c with  <dig> μm picowells was chosen and u <dig> cells were loaded into the i3c before the freezing - thawing cycle. the cell proliferation was monitored for up to  <dig> hours, by tracing the number of cells within each individual group by transparent light imaging. the numbers of post-thawed u <dig> cells of the corresponding cell groups were counted immediately after thawing and after  <dig> hours.

the post-thawing cell proliferation in the i3c was compared both with the division of u <dig> cells underwent ftc in standard cryo-vials and then transferred to standard culture flasks as well as with the untreated u <dig> cells cultured under standard conditions as described above.

cytoplasm membrane integrity and metabolic activity of u <dig> cells after the freezing - thawing cycle
the rate of fluorescein-diacetate hydrolysis  by non-specific esterases was measured in u <dig> cells after thawing and was calculated from repeated periodical measurements  for the same cells  <cit> . a mixture of fda  and pi  was added to u <dig> cells loaded in the i3c at rt.

mitochondrial membrane potential screening in u <dig> cells after the freezing - thawing cycle
the mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed by tmrm staining  <cit> . following the freezing - thawing cycle, u <dig> cells in the i3c were incubated in the presence of tmrm  for  <dig> min at 37°c, 5% co <dig>  and then washed with pbs.

multi-parametric analysis of cell physiological status after the freezing - thawing cycle
the simultaneous analysis of cells at different physiological statuses was performed using multi-parametric staining by tmrm, fda, pi and annexin v. following the freezing - thawing cycle, u <dig> cells in the i3cs were first stained by tmrm and by fitc-labeled annexin v , and the fluorescent and transmitted light images were acquired. then, a mixture of fda and pi  was introduced into the i3c and the same cells were imaged again. the kinetics of fda hydrolysis was evaluated as described in the section cytoplasm membrane integrity and metabolic activity of u <dig> cells after the freezing - thawing cycle. the coordinates for each acquired area  were saved throughout the experiment. thus, parallel analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular esterase activity, and apoptosis levels were obtained for each individual cell.

measurements and image analysis
an olympus cell^r system mounted on an inverted ix <dig> microscope  was equipped with a sub-micron marzhauser-wetzlar motorized stage , 14-bit orca ii c4742- <dig> camera , and a filter wheel including fluorescence cubes  470- <dig> nm,  <dig> nm long pass, and 510- <dig> nm; for tmrm 510- <dig> nm,  <dig> nm, 577- <dig> nm; and for pi 540- <dig> nm,  <dig> nm, 600- <dig> nm. all filters were obtained from chroma technology corporation .

olympus cell^p software was used for image analysis. an in-house developed software package was used to monitor the picowells' structure for automatic cell recognition. this module automatically recognizes the picowells' structure, creates a region of interest  for each picowell and identifies the regions that are occupied by cells.

statistical analysis
for each experiment, 2- <dig> i3cs were used. for each device,  <dig> images from  <dig> different areas were acquired . for proliferation tests, at least  <dig> individual picowells/cell groups were analyzed. the mean and sd for each measured parameter were calculated for the different cell populations under investigation . all the values are presented as average ± sd. the comparisons between experimental and control groups of cryo-devices were carried out using the anova test for small sample groups.

RESULTS
cell viability after the freezing - thawing cycle
the most commonly used functional assay for cell viability is the assessment of plasma membrane integrity by pi exclusion test. our preliminary results indicated that immediately after slow freezing and thawing, the viability of u <dig> cells  in the i3c was the same as in control samples, i.e., cells frozen in standard devices . since plasma membrane permeability is a late event in the process of cell death, and due to the fact that cell viability decreases during the time after thawing  <cit> , cell death was examined after prolonged post-thawing incubation periods .

u <dig> cells underwent a freezing - thawing cycle as described in materials and methods. the percentage of dead  cells was tested at appropriate time points after thawing. the corresponding temperature end points are presented. values are average ± sd of 2- <dig> experiments .

there was no increase observed in the number of dead cells during the first  <dig> hours after the freezing - thawing cycle, and it remained the same in experimental  and in cells frozen under standard conditions. prolonged culturing of post-thawed u <dig> cells in fresh enriched medium overnight demonstrated an increase in the proportion of dead cells both in the experimental  and standard devices samples . the percentage of dead cells  post thawing in the i3c varied from 5% to 54% in different samples. the corresponding parameters in the standard device samples varied from 7% to 32% in the cryo-vial and from 7% to 13% in the mini-vial. the statistical differences were not significant . the results of cell viability overnight after thawing were supported by the evaluation of the vitality of u <dig> cells which were frozen first at -80°c and then transferred to liquid nitrogen . the cells frozen in the i3c demonstrated a better cell survival overnight after thawing in comparison to cells frozen in standard cryo-vials . it should be noted that the level of cell death measured in untreated u <dig> cells which were cultured for  <dig> hours in i3cs did not differ from that of untreated cells that were cultured under the same conditions in standard flasks .

the post-thawing cell death in the current experimental procedures  was compared to the death of cells frozen at a standard concentration in cryo-vials . no statistical difference was found overnight after thawing in the percentage of cell death between the two cryo-protocols, for the low and high cell concentrations, respectively .

cell apoptosis after the freezing - thawing cycle
it has been shown that the low survival of human embryonic stem cells in conventional slow-cooling cryopreservation protocols is predominantly due to apoptosis rather than cellular necrosis  <cit> . other cell types, such as bone marrow cells, also display a high level of apoptosis upon freezing and thawing  <cit> .

the level of apoptosis in u <dig> cell populations which underwent freezing and thawing in the i3c or in control cryo-vials was determined by annexin v binding to externalized phosphatidylserine. under the current experimental conditions, variable percentages of early apoptotic cells  within different cultures of the u <dig> pro-monocyte cell line were found both in untreated and in cryopreserved cells . the average percentage of early apoptotic cells  <dig> hours after the freezing - thawing cycle was the same for cells in the experimental i3c and for control device samples . wide-ranging results are shown following overnight incubation of either untreated or post-thawing u <dig> cells. however, the average proportion of early apoptotic cells did not differ significantly in untreated cells, cells that underwent ftc in the i3c, or in standard cryo-vials .

u <dig> cells underwent a freezing - thawing cycle as described in materials and methods. the percentage of early apoptotic  cells was tested at appropriate time points after thawing. values are average ± sd of 2- <dig> experiments . the range of results obtained for the different experiments  is presented in brackets. *untreated u <dig> cells, which did not undergo ftc, were evaluated at the corresponding time points.

cell proliferation after the freezing - thawing cycle
cell maintenance and growth depend on the ability of cells to divide and proliferate. hence, apart from the cell intactness, the ability of cryopreserved cells to grow and proliferate is a major, essential factor for a successful cryopreservation process.

cell division was evaluated using i3c devices with  <dig> μm picowells. the  <dig> μm diameter picowells in the i3c array are large enough to hold several individual cells  in each picowell. the direct counting of the number of individual cells within each group/picowell immediately and several times after cell thawing facilitates the estimation of the division capability of the post-thawed cells. figure  <dig> shows transmitted light images of the same u <dig> cell groups, immediately after thawing and  <dig> hours after culturing. as can be seen, dramatic morphological changes are manifest upon cell growth and there is an increase in cell numbers.

analyzing the same picowells immediately after thawing and  <dig> hours after thawing showed an increase in cell number from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cells per picowell  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cells per picowell , yielding an average ratio of cell numbers  <dig> hours post-thawing to time  <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  as compared to a ratio of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for u <dig> cells which underwent the freezing - thawing cycle at the same cell concentration within standard cryo-vials and were then transferred to culture flasks . it should be noted that the proportion of dead cells  <dig> hours after thawing was the same for cells frozen in standard cryo-vials and cultured for  <dig> hours in a flask and for experimental cells in the i3c . under standard culturing conditions, untreated u <dig> cells  double their number within  <dig> hours.

analyzing cell division at the resolution of single picowells enabled us to select the specific cell groups that showed the highest proliferation rates. indeed, in half of the picowells an increase in cell number was evident upon  <dig> hours of post thawing culturing , while the other cell subsets exhibited no change or a decrease in cell number. such variation in cell division may be attributed to the different responses of non-synchronized cells to ftc, as previously described  <cit> .

mitochondrial membrane potential  after the freezing - thawing cycle
mitochondria are essential cell organelles involved in a variety of cellular activities, including atp synthesis, intracellular calcium homeostasis, and both integration and execution of apoptotic signals. the mitochondrial membrane potential  is a major indicator of mitochondrial function. higher mmp normally implies a better mitochondrial function  <cit> . moreover, differences in mmp detected within and between cultured cells reflect the corresponding differences in mitochondrial function or levels of their activity  <cit> .

in the present study, the mitochondrial membrane potential was evaluated by staining the cells with tmrm, a potentiometric membrane dye which accumulates in the mitochondria. in normally functioning tmrm stained cells, the intensity of the fluorescent signal is high and it is localized mainly within the mitochondria and not in the cytoplasm . hence, the mean fluorescence intensity of the tmrm signal over the cell area  reflects the mitochondrial trans-membrane potential, while the dispersion of the tmrm signal within the cell region  indicates the spatial distribution of tmrm staining. high fi sd designates heterogeneous staining, e.g., considerable differences between mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fluorescence intensity. untreated, normal tmrm stained u <dig> cells are characterized by high values of both mean fi and fi sd reflecting their normal mitochondrial activity .

the mmp after the freezing - thawing cycle was measured immediately after thawing , after  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> hours.

all post-thawed u <dig> cells were tmrm positive within  <dig> min after thawing. however, the average fi of tmrm-stained cells immediately after thawing was low compared to unfrozen samples , indicating a relatively low mitochondrial trans-membrane potential, both in the experimental i3c samples  and in control cells frozen in standard cryo-vials . no statistically significant differences with regard to both parameters of tmrm staining were demonstrated between the i3c and samples that underwent ftc in a standard cryo-vial .

after  <dig>  hours post-thawing, the u <dig> cells exhibited mmp values similar to those of control unfrozen cells. figure 4a depicts a scatter diagram of mean fi vs. fi sd of individual u <dig> cells without freezing and  <dig>  hours post-thawing incubation. it can be seen that both parameters are similar in unfrozen controls and in the experimental i3c cell populations. a small  subset of tmrm negative cells  appeared among u <dig> cells after the  <dig>  hour post-thawing period. the proportion of this tmrm negative cell group was  <dig> % ±  <dig>  and  <dig> % ±  <dig>  at  <dig> and  <dig> hours post-thawing, respectively. no statistically significant difference was demonstrated in the percentage of these tmrm-negative cells between the cryo-devices . these results are in agreement with the above results that showed a decrease in cell viability during post-thawing incubation, as expressed by the pi exclusion test.

distribution histograms of individual tmrm mean fi values within u <dig> cell populations exposed or unexposed to the freezing - thawing cycle are shown in figure 4b. a wide distribution of individual cells' mitochondrial potential values is shown within the unexposed u <dig> cell population. similar distributions of individual cells' fi values are evident after  <dig>  hour incubation in the post-thawed cell groups  indicating normal mitochondrial activity. within the three cell populations, the cell subgroup which exhibited a low mmp  is evident. the percentage of these cells with a low mitochondrial activity increased following the freezing - thawing cycle in both cryopreservation protocols , in respect to the untreated cell population .

at this time , the mean fi and fi sd in the cell populations exposed to the freezing - thawing cycle either in the i3c or in the control cryo-vials  exhibited no statistically significant differences .  <dig> hours after thawing, u <dig> cells in the i3c demonstrated full mitochondrial recovery and showed mitochondrial activity equal to that of the untreated cells, with an average mean fi of  <dig>  au ±  <dig>  and fi sd of  <dig>  au ±  <dig>  for the cells frozen in the i3c, and a mean fi of  <dig>  au ±  <dig>  and fi sd of  <dig>  au ±  <dig>  for the unfrozen control cells .

u <dig> cells underwent a freezing - thawing cycle in appropriate cryo-devices and  <dig>  hours after thawing cells were stained by tmrm as described in materials and methods. mean fi and fi sd values were measured by image analysis in each individual cell. the average mean and sd for each measured parameter were calculated for the different cell populations under investigation  as described in statistical analysis.values are average ± sd of each group of cryo-devices.

cytoplasm membrane integrity and metabolic activity of u <dig> cells after the freezing - thawing cycle
the intensity and rate of accumulation of the fluorescent product of fda hydrolysis within the cells reflect both the enzymatic activity required for the hydrolysis and the integrity of the cell membrane necessary for the retention of the product. as a rule, the fda staining is used for post-thawing estimation of cell vitality, since in the cells with damaged membranes, the accumulation of hydrolyzed fluorescein does not take place and the intracellular fluorescent signal is not observed  <cit> . figure  <dig> presents a representative fda staining image of u <dig> cells exposed to the freezing - thawing cycle in the i3c, at  <dig> hours after thawing. the figure demonstrates good intracellular accumulation of fluorescein in the majority of cells and the presence of only one non-stained cell. moreover, it is clear that this membrane-compromised cell can be easily distinguished from the remaining, normal stained cells, based on its morphological appearance in the transmitted light image.

unlike pi and annexin v staining, fda staining of post-thawed u <dig> cells, as reflected only by the percentage of fda positive cells, did not change significantly during the post-thawing incubation. the percentage of stained cells was  <dig> % ±  <dig>  and  <dig> % ±  <dig>  after  <dig> and  <dig> hours post-thawing in the i3c, and  <dig> % ±  <dig>  and  <dig> % ±  <dig>  for the corresponding time periods for cells frozen in control cryo-vials. this indicates that this parameter is not a sensitive marker for post-thawing cell status. the quantitative analysis of the individual cell rate of fda hydrolysis was done by kinetic measurements of fluorescein accumulation and the calculation of the linear slope of fi increase over time  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the fda staining of u <dig> cells at  <dig> hours after thawing, and the calculated staining rates . as seen, there is a large difference in the linear slopes for individual cells within the entire cell population, which signifies a large variation in the individual metabolic activity. the percentage of post-thawed cells that exhibited a positive fda hydrolysis slope was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  as compared to  <dig> ±  <dig>  in the unfrozen cell population. the mean linear slope for the fda staining was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the i3c-frozen cells, very close to that of the unfrozen u <dig> cells . figure  <dig> shows the mean fda hydrolysis rates in the i3c-frozen u <dig> cells and in cells exposed to the freezing - thawing cycle in the control cryo-devices, as measured  <dig> hours after thawing. the statistical differences of the fda hydrolysis rates in the cells that underwent the freezing - thawing cycle in the different cryo-devices were estimated at p = <dig> .

multi-parametric analysis following the freezing - thawing cycle in the i3c
the unique optical and mechanical features of the i3c enabled the observation and treatment of the same individual cells, and finding direct associations between several parameters at a single cell resolution.

u <dig> cells underwent the freezing - thawing cycle within  <dig> μm diameter i3c devices and then parallel analyses of mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular esterase activity, and apoptosis levels at the resolution of individual cells, were accomplished using multi-parametric staining by tmrm, fda hydrolysis rates, and annexin v - pi test, respectively, as described in materials and methods,  <dig> hours after thawing .

according to the established single parameter apoptosis assessment using double annexin v and pi staining, three cell subgroups were identified:

a. the intact cell population  - negative for both annexin v and pi staining.

b. the late apoptosis cell group as evidenced by the parallel staining with both pi and annexin v.

c. early apoptosis cells characterized by annexin v binding but which were pi negative.

utilizing the i3c methodology, additional analyses of mmp and esterase enzymatic activity in the same individual post-thawing u <dig> cells from the above cell groups were made. the percentages of the different cell groups and their corresponding average fluorescence signals are summarized in table  <dig>  while single cell results are illustrated in figure 8d, in a scatter diagram of the individual cells' values of tmrm fluorescence intensity vs. esterase enzymatic activity.

u <dig> cells underwent a freezing - thawing cycle as described in materials and methods. overnight after thawing the multi-parametric analysis was performed and four parameters were elicited for each single cell. the cell subgroups were defined as described in multi-parametric analysis following the freezing - thawing cycle in the i3c section. values are average ± sd in individual cells' subgroups. the percentage of each subgroup from the total population in a representative experiment is shown in brackets.

as table  <dig> shows, the late apoptosis cell group  showed no tmrm staining and no esterase activity. the intact cell group, which comprises the majority  of the cell population, is characterized by high functional activity as reflected by the maximal tmrm fi and the highest fda slopes. as shown in fig 8d, within this cell cluster, the most vigorous cells are exemplified by the uppermost mitochondrial and enzymatic activity and can be easily selected.

post-thawing cells that underwent early apoptosis , display low mitochondrial and enzymatic activity. however, in this cell group, two cell subsets were detected based on the quantitative measurements of individual mmp values. the majority of this cell group  showed no mitochondrial activity  and low fda hydrolysis rates and termed mmp - subgroup. an additional subset  exhibited detectable but low mitochondrial membrane potential  along with low fda hydrolysis rates . this subgroup termed early apoptosis mmp + subgroup, and could be distinguished from the other apoptotic cells by their tmrm fi values .

in untreated u <dig> cells growing in culture, the percentage of cells undergoing spontaneous early and late apoptosis was 12% ± 4% and 5% ± 3% respectively. among the early apoptotic subgroup, most of the cells  were mmp+ and showed considerable mitochondrial activity.

discussion
in recent years, great effort has been dedicated to improving procedures for freezing and resuscitation of various cell types and to overcoming or minimizing the cell damage induced by freezing and thawing  <cit> . each new approach calls not only for the optimal technical conditions, but also for noninvasive, simple, and reliable means to test the outcome of the process. the current work presents the means and methodologies for using an optical cryo-apparatus for monitoring several fundamental functional activities of cryopreserved cells, utilizing the recently developed i3c cryo-device.

our results confirmed that spatially identifiable cells that undergo a freezing - thawing cycle in i3c devices exhibit the same functional activity as control cells. the proportions of intact cells and apoptosis rates, as well as the division of cells frozen and thawed in the i3c, were similar to those for cells that were frozen under the same experimental conditions in standard cryo-vessels. moreover, the cells displayed a normal functional activity, as reflected by the multi-parametric quantitative analysis of the mitochondria status and intracellular enzymatic activity.

the use of cryopreserved cells is becoming widespread in drug screening, since cryopreservation per se has been shown to have minimal effects on pharmacological testing and can be applied to many cell types and cell assays, including arrested cell division  <cit> . however, in the fields of reproductive medicine and cell-based therapy, the ability of the post-thawing cells to divide and proliferate is crucial. the large picowells  of the i3c enable us to culture and visualize multiple small cell groups, as well as monitor their behavior and propagation at a single cell resolution. with only a few cells in each picowell, real-time, kinetic measurements of cell division can be performed, thus specific non-dividing or highly proliferative cell clusters can be detected. this attribute is essential for stem cell clone analyses, where, after cell divisions, the newly formed compact colony remains confined to its picowell, enabling time-lapse imaging of the evolving clone. moreover, the unique optical features of the i3c facilitate the morphological observations of cryopreserved cells in bright field microscopy. such a non-intrusive, label-free technique is imperative for the future utilization of the post-thawed cells in clinical applications.

it has been shown that low mitochondrial activity is associated with cryo-damage  <cit> . mitochondrial dysfunction in porcine oocytes was found to be directly responsible for the early arrest of pre-implantation embryos in vitro  <cit> . an irreversible loss of high mitochondrial membrane potential was detected in cryopreserved mouse embryos  <cit> . the decrease in mmp was found to be involved in the activation of caspase- <dig> and apoptosis induction  <cit> .

in our cell system, the post-thawing appearance of tmrm-negative cells probably reflects the total collapse of mmp, which was seen upon opening the mitochondrial permeability transition pore during apoptotic signaling  <cit> . however, time dependent recovery of the mitochondrial trans-membrane potential as manifested by the increase in tmrm staining of post-thawed cells  <dig> hours after ftc, was shown in the rest of the cell population. these results are in agreement with previous data  <cit> .

furthermore, within tmrm-positive cells, the assessment of individual cells' mmp by temporal and spatial quantitative analysis of the fluorescence signal was found to be a very sensitive parameter for cell status following the freezing - thawing cycle. maximal tmrm signals accompanied fully functioning cells that were annexin v and pi negative and showed the highest fda hydrolysis rates. multi-parametric analysis at the individual cell resolution is the most significant achievement of the methodology presented here. simultaneous quantitative measurement of single cells' mmp, esterase activity, and phosphatidylserine externalization, was used to detect the most viable and active cells within the cryopreserved cell population. all of the above parameters are well-established apoptosis markers.

the role of apoptosis in the low recovery rates after cryopreservation of human embryonic stem cells  <cit>  and of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells  <cit>  has recently been emphasized. as a consequence, new strategies to enhance the post-thawing survival of such precious cells, by utilizing either protease or apoptosis inhibitors have emerged  <cit> . since different cell types, at different cell development stages, have varying sensitivities to cryopreservation-induced apoptosis, the ability to assess the rate of apoptosis in individual post-thawed cells is crucial.

moreover, the variability of the kinetics of the death course within cell populations calls for monitoring several apoptotic parameters occurring in single or subgroups of cells within a complex population.

the presented i3c device and methodologies address the above requirements for multi-parametric evaluation of the program cell-death process at the level of individual cells. the system enables not only the detection of fully active and apoptotic cells by the traditional annexin v - pi staining, but the depiction of individual cells and subgroups by the additional simultaneous analysis of mmp and esterase activity. thus, the quantitative measurements of individual cells' tmrm fi and fda hydrolysis rates revealed apoptotic subpopulations which would have been undetected by other methods. moreover, among the heterogeneous population of viable cells, which exhibited variable metabolic and mitochondrial activities, the selection of the most promising active cells becomes feasible.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we introduce advanced technological and analytical capabilities for fluorescence and bright-field investigation of individual post-thawed cells. such an examination reveals the functional and morphological features of each cell within the population and facilitates the detection and subsequent retrieval of the most viable, highly active cells for further utilization.
