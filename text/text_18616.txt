BACKGROUND
with the growing availability of a large number of new genome sequences, there is an ongoing interest in the structures of the proteins represented by the open reading frames in those genomes. although there has been a growth in the number of crystal structures of proteins as the result of structural protemics programmes worldwide, their production has not kept pace with the sequencing effort. furthermore, such programmes often produce small amounts of any given protein which are not enough for crystal structure analysis. however, these quantities are often sufficient for other biophysical studies.

modern sequence-based prediction methods can provide information on the secondary structure content of these proteins without the need for producing any protein. recent years have seen large improvements in the per-residue secondary structure prediction from sequence  <cit> , although they are still limited in their accuracies, especially when applied to certain classes of protein, most notably those with high β-sheet content.

circular dichroism  and fourier transform infrared  spectroscopies are commonly used techniques for secondary structure content determination, and these methods have also shown great advances in their accuracies  <cit> , with the development of new reference data bases  <cit>  and empirical methods  <cit> . the spectral data collected by these methods requires a relatively small amount of pure protein and can be obtained rapidly  <cit> .

the pioneering work of chou in predicting secondary structure from sequence was through an elaborate and elegant covariance matrix approach  <cit> . in this study we have examined the performance of sequence based prediction methods using a neural network methodology, versus the experimentally-determined methods of cd and ftir for assessing secondary structure content. in order to do this, we have used existing reference data sets available in the literature along with established analytical methods and demonstrated the synergies between the different strategies thereby proposing a new combined approach which will greatly improve the results obtained over any single technique that may find use in structural proteomics and other structural biology studies.

RESULTS
secondary structure predictions from sequences
reported correlation coefficients for secondary structure content prediction by cd are typically in the range of r =  <dig> – <dig>  for α-helix , r =  <dig> – <dig>  for β-sheet   <cit> . the reported values vary because of differences in the reference dataset, secondary structure assignment and prediction algorithms used. the secondary structure content prediction for sequence prediction methods is generally not reported after publication of the crystal structure. the current highest reported secondary structure content prediction by sequence in the literature is r =  <dig>  for α-helix and r =  <dig>  for β-sheet  <cit> . more recent methods have their performances available on the eva website  <cit> . however, currently r for secondary structure content prediction is not reported on this web-site.

the per-residue q <dig> score of the neural network method is  <dig> %. this is in the range of that currently found for the best methods available  <cit> . the various performance parameters show that the best prediction is for α-helix with slightly lower per-residue prediction accuracy for β-sheet . the overall secondary structure content prediction parameters  are nearly  comparable with those obtained from cd and ftir methods  <cit> . an important feature of the sequence prediction methods is that for each residue prediction a corresponding reliability index is obtained. in order to establish if this was useful for assessing the overall reliability of the secondary structure prediction of a protein, a net reliability index was obtained by taking the average reliability index for each of the residues in a protein. we find that there is a weak correlation  between the abs error of the secondary structure content prediction and the net reliability index of a protein. the correlation coefficient between the abs of secondary structure prediction and the per protein q <dig> score is - <dig>  and - <dig>  for α-helix and β-sheet, respectively. hence a method with very high secondary structure content prediction accuracy would provide a measure of reliability to a sequence-based prediction.

secondary structure content prediction
cross-validation of the rasp <dig> data set shows that the cd data gives slightly better prediction accuracy than the ftir data . combining cd and ftir spectra into composite cd/ftir spectra gives similar large improvements to that shown previously  <cit> , relative to either of the cd or ftir methods used separately. the sequence-based prediction for this data set produced better results than the combined spectroscopic methods for helical components but poorer results for sheet components. combining sequence-based with either type of spectroscopic data improved the sheet content , but had little effect on the already good helix predictions. a combination of both cd and ftir data with sequence prediction produced the best overall prediction.

cross-validation of the sp <dig> data  showed that as previously demonstrated  <cit>  srcd spectra, which have a higher information content due to additional transitions being measured, produce better results than ccd spectra. in the case of helix content, the experimental- and sequence-based results are very similar, but the combined methods improved all three categories of secondary structure significantly, resulting in a very high correlation with the crystal structures. the rasp <dig> and sp <dig> datasets had q3seq scores of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, which are similar to that found from the 3-fold cross-validation of the gseq dataset.

spectroscopic identification of poor sequence-based predictions
another question that can be addressed is whether secondary structure content measurements can be used to aid with the overall accuracy of a sequence-based prediction method. we see a negative correlation between the q <dig> scores and the abs difference between the content prediction from sequence and spectroscopy with r = - <dig>  for α-helix and r = - <dig>  for β-sheet from the rasp <dig> dataset and r = - <dig>  for α-helix and r = - <dig>  for β-sheet from the sp <dig> dataset.

examining the individual per protein q <dig> scores from sequence prediction of the rasp <dig> datasets and the sp <dig> datasets we see that monellin has the poorest score for both datasets, with a q <dig> score of  <dig> %. the sequence prediction of secondary structure content for monellin produces 27% α-helix and 20% β-sheet, as compared to the 17% α-helix and 51% β-sheet found in the crystal structure. the cd and ftir spectra  clearly show monellin to have characteristics of a predominantly β-sheet-containing protein in greater quantity than that predicted from sequence. a composite cd and ftir spectrum of glucose oxidase, a protein whose crystal structure  contains 27% α-helix and 20% β-sheet  is plotted for comparison. the nn prediction using the cd and ftir data in rasp <dig> dataset  plus the sequence information gives a prediction of 12% α-helix and 43% β-sheet content, a result much closer to the actual values.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the results above show that for the proteins in the rasp <dig> and sp <dig> reference datasets, a similar secondary structure content accuracy is obtained from the sequence prediction methods as from the experimentally-based methods. combining the sequence and the ccd and ftir approaches results in a significantly improved accuracy, especially for β-sheet-rich proteins. for srcd data, combining this with the sequence prediction method, similarly there is a significant improvement over both these approaches when evaluated in isolation. notably there is more information content available from the srcd extended wavelength data which leads to improved accuracy in determining individual secondary structure components  <cit> . restricting the defined secondary structures to the three components, as is common practice for ftir and secondary structure predictions, imposes identical limitation requirements on the srcd data although many more components than these can be distinguished. the considerable improvement in α-helix over β-sheet and 'other' reflects that this secondary structure component still provides the dominant spectral characteristics to srcd spectra. were ftir data to be collected for the proteins of the sp <dig> dataset then this would most likely lead to further significant improvements when combined with the srcd data and sequence prediction methods. in future, other methods such as raman optical activity  <cit>  could be incorporated into these combinations which would likely result in a further overall improvement.

there are many structural proteomics programmes producing proteins for crystal structure investigations. of note, a number of these proteins prove difficult to obtain in the amounts necessary for such investigations. however, in these cases spectroscopic methods such as srcd, notable because of the small amounts of material needed to obtain spectra,  <cit>  in combination with secondary structure sequence prediction methods could well provide significant insight into the protein structure. a further benefit arises from such a combined approach. sequence-based methods can sometimes generate poor predictions for protein secondary structure content, which can go unrecognised and therefore lead to further inaccuracies as a result. the reliability of the prediction results can be tested when in combination with the experimental-based spectroscopic methods, thus providing an improved measure of reliability.

there is evidence that from srcd data the higher information content enables fold information to be obtained from the data . such fold information combined with a method for tertiary structure prediction such as threader prediction techniques  <cit>  could offer a novel approach to modeling protein structures, potentially with an improved accuracy. the combination of sequence prediction methods with experimental spectroscopically-determined methods for secondary structure content offer a valuable addition for gaining information about protein structure, and maybe potentially an insight into function as a result.
