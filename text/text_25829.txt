BACKGROUND
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  are a family of persistent, hydrophobic environmental toxins that originate from the incomplete combustion of carbon-based fuels as well as from the release of petroleum into the environment  <cit> . as pahs are potent carcinogens in humans  <cit> , remediation of pah contamination is an ongoing endeavor. traditionally, removal of pollutants from soil is a disruptive and costly physical process; consequently, there is strong interest in applying phytoremediation, the use of plants to sequester, volatilize, or degrade pollutants  <cit> .

an idealized plant used for pah removal would uptake large amounts of the pollutant into the root system, transport the molecules to cellular compartments, metabolize the pollutant, and utilize or volatilize the nontoxic byproducts. in practice, these processes are rate- or capacity-limited, thereby limiting the net removal of pah from soil. over time, stress from pollutants and their byproducts can cause cumulative plant damage, further reducing pollutant flux through the system. with the goals of identifying and relaxing these constraints, theoretical and applied research is ongoing. as an example of enhanced arsenic phytoremediation, a series of experiments identified limiting processes and introduced transgenic constructs into arabidopsis, resulting in greatly increased uptake and tolerance of the pollutant  <cit> . unlike in arsenic phytoremediation, where plant hyperaccumulation followed by harvesting is the goal, phytoremediation of pahs could ultimately lead to complete degradation of the organic compounds.

following pah treatment, plants exhibit a variety of stresses. previous studies have shown that pahs cause trichome and leaf deformations, accumulation of h2o <dig>  oxidative stress, cell death, upregulation of antioxidant systems, and reduced plant growth  <cit> . in many regards, these symptoms broadly resemble the pathogenic hypersensitive response   <cit> . while there is substantial evidence of oxidative stress, the signaling and biochemical changes leading to the complex pah symptoms are unknown.

the phytohormone ethylene has long been known to play central roles in oxidative stress responses and cell death  <cit> , in plant growth inhibition  <cit> , and in abiotic as well as pathogen responses  <cit> . these broad parallels, as well as the observation that the ethylene-responsive gene gstf <dig> is upregulated in pah-treated arabidopsis  <cit> , suggest that ethylene signaling may play a role in the pah stress response. to better understand these areas, this study performed dna microarray experiments to measure global transcriptional changes in arabidopsis when treated with the three-ringed pah phenanthrene. in addition, possible roles of ethylene signaling were investigated using ethylene-responsive reporter plants, ethylene production mutants, ethylene signaling mutants, and exogenous application of an ethylene precursor.

RESULTS
transcriptional responses to phenanthrene
to assess differential transcript levels of pah-treated arabidopsis, microarray experiments were performed on wild type  whole plants grown for  <dig> days on sterile medium containing  <dig> mm or  <dig>  mm phenanthrene. the pah treatment level is comparable to levels found in polluted land and water sites  <cit> . a statistically significant set of transcripts was selected using a benjamini and hochberg false discovery rate  of  <dig> . of these, high-stringency biological relevance was defined as the genes with greater than two-fold change in either direction, resulting in  <dig> phenanthrene-responsive transcripts that were analyzed further. the full microarray dataset is available in additional file  <dig>  and the differentially-expressed subset is available in additional file  <dig> 

to elucidate classes of transcripts affected by phenanthrene, gene ontology  analyses were performed on the  <dig> differentially-expressed genes. a summary of this analysis is available in additional file  <dig>  complementing the go analysis, mapman figures  were produced to visualize phenanthrene-induced changes in cellular processes. additional file  <dig> highlights relevant transcriptional changes related to stress, hormone signaling, and other selected processes.

a striking feature is the downregulation of photosynthesis-related mrna levels . in concert with the reduced photosynthesis, chlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis as well as protein targeting to the chloroplasts were reduced . downregulated processes further included protein biosynthesis and gluconeogenesis .

of the differentially-expressed transcripts, there is a strong overrepresentation of genes involved in biotic and abiotic stresses, oxidative stress, wounding, immunity, and defense responses . for instance, the genes coding for the ethylene-inducible defense response proteins pdf <dig> a and pdf <dig> b  <cit>  were strongly upregulated on the microarray . the pathogenesis related  gene pr- <dig>  which is the marker gene for systemic acquired resistance  was upregulated over 200-fold. pr- <dig> is induced by salicylic acid  but does not require ethylene or jasmonate  <cit> . transcript levels of pr- <dig>  - <dig> , - <dig>  and - <dig> were also increased by phenanthrene .

a variety of antioxidant and detoxification systems were affected . the transcript level of the arginine decarboxylase adc <dig>  a key enzyme in polyamine synthesis, was increased on the pah microarray . twelve microarray probes representing glutathione transferases , enzymes that tag xenobiotics with glutathione for transport into the vacuole  <cit> , reported significant increases . for instance, the gst atgstu <dig> was upregulated on phenanthrene. additionally, the microarray probe that recognized atgstf <dig>  and atgstf <dig>  indicated a  <dig> -fold increase of the transcripts on phenanthrene. similarly, the probe that binds the gsts at1g <dig> and at1g <dig> indicated 12-fold upregulation of these genes. among the phenanthrene responsive gsts, atgstu <dig> has previously been shown to be sharply and rapidly induced by the herbicides acetochlor and metolachlor, as well as the explosives  <dig> ,6-trinitrotoluene and hexahydro- <dig> ,5-trinitro- <dig> ,5-triazine  <cit> . along similar lines, udp-glucoronosyl and udp-glucosyl transferase ugt74f <dig>  was strongly upregulated by phenanthrene. this gene was constitutively upregulated in antioxidant loss-of-function mutants  <cit> , which is consistent with upregulation in response to reactive oxygen species . activation of the secretory system is further indicated by upregulation of protein targeting through the er and the golgi apparatus . inversely, mrna levels of several antioxidant genes were diminished . downregulated mrnas include the catalases  cat <dig>  cat <dig>  as well as cat <dig> which is consistent with previous rt-pcr data  <cit> . the ascorbate peroxidases apx <dig>  and tapx  as well as the superoxide-dismutase fsd <dig>  were also downregulated on phenanthrene.

expression levels of many hormone-responsive genes were changed: generally, jasmonic acid , sa, or abscisic acid responsive genes were induced, whereas gibberellic acid, brassinolide or auxin responsive genes were repressed . expression of many typical ethylene-inducible genes was induced, including defensins, hel, gsts and basic chitinase . however, other typical ethylene-responsive genes, such as hls <dig>  were unaffected. two genes of the ethylene biosynthesis pathway were downregulated: acs <dig>  an aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid  synthase, and aco <dig>  an 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid  oxidase. of the  <dig> putative ethylene-regulated ap2/erebp transcription factor genes  <cit> ,  <dig> are represented on the microarray , and mrna levels of ten of these were more than two-fold affected by phenanthrene. interestingly, the ethylene response factor erf1- <dig>  which integrates ethylene and ja signals  <cit> , was significantly upregulated in the pah dataset . an overview of the transcriptional changes in hormonal and other regulatory processes is given in additional file  <dig> and additional file 4f.

comparison between phenanthrene and other stress and hormone treatments
the gene ontology and mapman analyses  of the transcriptional profile indicate that the pah response shares commonality with biotic stress responses. illustrating this relationship, figure  <dig> compares the phenanthrene dataset to the treatment with the pathogenic fungus botrytis cinerea, and indicates a strong correlation  between the two treatments. in figure  <dig>  quadrants i and iii contain the transcripts that were jointly up- or downregulated on both treatments. the vast majority of the phenanthrene responsive transcripts fall into these categories. for instance, the cell wall expansins atexp <dig>  atexp <dig>  <cit> , and atexp <dig> were downregulated on both treatments . quadrant ii contains transcripts that were downregulated by phenanthrene but upregulated by the b. cinerea fungal attack, and includes the ethylene biosynthesis gene acs <dig>  inversely, quadrant iv contains transcripts that are highly expressed on phenanthrene and diminished by the pathogen, including the cell wall expansin atexp <dig>  atnap <dig> , which encodes a nap-type abc transporter, and at1g <dig> of unknown function.

to further compare the pah response with other experimental conditions, the phenanthrene dataset was clustered with a variety of published microarray datasets measuring responses to biotic, abiotic, chemical, and physical stresses as well as hormone and hormone inhibitor treatments. table  <dig> shows correlations between the phenanthrene microarray and other experimental conditions. the heatmap in figure  <dig> shows the results from clustering genes and experimental conditions. the complete dataset of the heatmap is available in additional file  <dig>  the manifest clusters in the heatmap show strong similarity with various strains of pseudomonas syringae, as well as the fungi b. cinerea and erysiphe orontii. ozone, osmotic, and oxidative stresses, as well as senescence, also correlated with the phenanthrene response.

in contrast with the phenanthrene-induced downregulation of acs <dig>  the transcript was upregulated by b. cinerea attack and in other biotic stresses, oxidative stress, o <dig>  sa, genotoxicity, indoleacetic acid , tiba  and agno <dig>  treatments. wrky <dig>  a member of a transcription factor family that frequently plays critical roles in stress responses  <cit> , followed a similar pattern. bhlh <dig>  a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, was sharply upregulated on the phenanthrene, o <dig>  and genotoxicity microarrays, but little affected by the bacterial infections. atopt <dig>  an oligopeptide transporter was similarly regulated.

among the hormone treatment microarrays, the sa dataset had the strongest correlation with the phenanthrene data . in addition to pr- <dig> and other pathogen resistance  genes, the phenanthrene microarray identified additional transcripts that indicate sa involvement. first, ics <dig>  an isochorismate synthase involved in sa biosynthesis, is normally induced by pathogen infection  <cit>  and was upregulated on phenanthrene . second, the transcript of eds <dig> , a mate transporter necessary for sa signaling, was also upregulated by the pah , and is also induced in the o <dig>  ultraviolet, and some biotic stress datasets. finally, several sa early-response transcripts were induced on the phenanthrene and sa microarrays, including the udp-glycosyl transferase ugt <dig> and gst <dig> 

low correlations with the phenanthrene treatment were found for treatments with abscisic acid, the auxin transport inhibitor triiodobenzoic acid , brassinolide, cytokinin, the auxin indoleacetic acid, the gibberellic acid biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol , the ethylene precursor acc, and the inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis, aminoethoxyvinylglycine  . however, treatment with agno <dig>  which inhibits ethylene signaling  <cit> , correlated noticeably with phenanthrene . the inconsistency of the two ethylene inhibitors could be due to non-ethylene side-effects of agno <dig> or avg. analyzing the full set of ~ <dig> ×  <dig> probes on the microarray, these two treatments produced a paradoxically low spearman correlation coefficient of ρ =  <dig> , thereby supporting a side-effect hypothesis. furthermore, the correlation between the agno <dig> and o <dig> microarray datasets was ρ =  <dig> , hinting that silver nitrate induced oxidative stress. taken together, these data indicate that the similarities between phenanthrene and agno <dig> induced stress responses are not related to perturbed ethylene signaling.

analyses of transgenic ethylene-responsive gus-reporter plants
ethylene is commonly known as a stress hormone. the microarray results clearly indicated involvement of ethylene-regulated genes in the phenanthrene response, but the downregulated ethylene biosynthesis transcripts aco <dig> and acs <dig> suggested that the pah reduced ethylene production. at the same time, comparisons of the phenanthrene data with ethylene inhibition and precursor spike-in datasets  suggested that ethylene involvement was more nuanced than a global up- or down-regulation of ethylene signaling. to better understand this relationship, we analysed the role of ethylene under phenanthrene treatment more closely.

first, to observe localized effects of phenanthrene on ethylene signaling targets, we used the transgenic reporter plants ch5b::gus and atgstf2::gus, which indicate gus expression driven by ethylene-inducible promoters from the bean basic chitinase  <cit>  and atgstf <dig> genes  <cit> , respectively. activation of transcription from the ch5b promoter in arabidopsis leaves requires ethylene signaling through the ethylene receptor etr <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, while being responsive to ethylene, the atgstf promoter can also be activated through an etr1-independent mechanism after treatment with glutathione, paraquat, copper, and naphthalene acetic acid   <cit> . figure  <dig> shows reporter gene expression in both lines when grown in long days in the presence of phenanthrene. in both lines, the reporter expression occurred in scattered patches on the leaf blades. these spatial patterns are similar to the patterns of necrotic lesions induced by phenanthrene  <cit> . to dissect the contributions of phenanthrene and ethylene in activating these promoters, the two reporter lines were grown in the dark for  <dig> d while treated with combinations of phenanthrene and acc. figure  <dig> shows that in both lines, compared to the untreated controls , pah treatment upregulated gus expression . the treatments with acc alone  or in combination with phenanthrene  produced similar gus expression patterns.

although the histological gus-assay is not quantitative, the relative intensity of staining can provide meaningful information. when treated with phenanthrene, gus expression was generally stronger in atgstf2::gus plants than in the ch5b::gus plants . the strongest gus activity in ch5b::gus was due to acc treatment . in contrast, in atgstf2::gus gus activity was strongest in plants exposed to both acc and phenanthrene .

responses of ethylene mutants to phenanthrene treatment
to further determine whether pah stress involves ethylene signaling, we compared the phenotypes of several ethylene mutants to wt arabidopsis grown on phenanthrene-containing media. the classic triple response of dark-grown seedlings grown in the presence of ethylene produces an exaggerated apical hook, a thickened, short hypocotyl, and a short root. utilizing this behavior, ethylene signaling mutants and wt were grown in the dark to examine how the mutations affected phenanthrene-induced growth responses in seedlings. the mutants included the ethylene overproducer eto <dig>  <cit> ; the ethylene-insensitive gain-of-function receptor mutant etr1- <dig>  <cit> ; the mutant etr1- <dig>  <cit>  which exhibits slightly enhanced ethylene sensitivity, and the etr1-6;etr2-3;ein4- <dig>  <cit>  triple ethylene receptor mutant which exhibits constitutive ethylene signaling. because the wt and ethylene signaling mutants differ in root and shoot lengths even under control conditions, absolute length comparisons under phenanthrene treatment are not meaningful between genotypes. to facilitate comparison, the relative length change within each genotype was defined as the ratio  of phenanthrene-treated length to non-treated length. these response ratios were then compared between the genotypes.

root growth of phenanthrene-treated mutants differed markedly from the hypocotyl responses . contrasting with the hypocotyl, root elongation of dark-grown wt was only marginally affected by phenanthrene, and the etr1- <dig> mutant was unaffected. surprisingly, eto <dig>  and the triple mutant etr1-6;etr2-3;ein4- <dig>  grew even longer roots on phenanthrene than on control medium. in contrast, etr1- <dig> roots were significantly shorter on phenanthrene than on control medium .

discussion
broadly, the response of arabidopsis to phenanthrene is a complex perturbation of multiple systems, with a dominant theme of oxidative stress and similarities to pathogenic responses.

phenanthrene induces oxidative stress and a metabolic shift from anabolism to catabolism
consistent with physiological studies that associated pah treatment with oxidative stress  <cit> , transcripts related to oxidative stress were overrepresented among the phenanthrene responsive genes . in addition, polyamine levels and adc enzyme activity were reported to increase in the aquatic plant riccia fluitans when treated with phenanthrene  <cit> , which is consistent with the present data that indicate an upregulation of adc <dig> mrna.

at the systemic level, the microarray results bear strong resemblance to the transcriptional responses induced by fungal, bacterial pathogen, ozone or osmotic shock treatments . as the phenanthrene-treated plants were grown in sterile conditions, it is unlikely that the similarities to pathogen treatments were caused by confounding microbial effects. more likely, the unifying theme of these treatments is the production of ros  <cit> . following the initial oxidative burst, pah-treated plants activate mechanisms similar to a pathogen defense including hr-like cell death  <cit>  and induction of a battery of defense genes.

similar responses have been described in ozone-treated plants, which also generate ros and erroneously activate pathogen defense programs  <cit> . however, while oxidative stress was occurring under phenanthrene treatment, several antioxidant genes were downregulated. this scenario can occur when plants invoke a positive feedback loop that amplifies ros to serve as signaling molecules  <cit> . an early perturbation of the redox network is clear as downregulation of catalase mrna  <cit> , as well as increased h2o <dig> levels and cell death  <cit> , were detected within  <dig> h of pah treatment. along similar lines, prior work in arabidopsis found cat <dig> downregulated within three hours of o <dig> treatment  <cit> . supporting the notion of ros positive feedback activation, the respiratory burst oxidase atrbohd was upregulated in phenanthrene-treated plants , and was similarly upregulated by o <dig> and pathogenic attack conditions. similarly, the tobacco ortholog ntrbohd was induced during an oxidative burst under o <dig> treatment  <cit> . the widespread destruction of chloroplast and mitochondrial membranes  <cit>  may have injected additional ros into the system.

pah treatment caused downregulation of genes involved in photosynthesis and protein biosynthesis , which agrees with previous studies reporting overall diminished plant size and reduced chlorophyll levels  <cit> . up-regulation of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle , as well as the similarity to the senescence microarray data , further reveal a major metabolic shift from anabolism to catabolism. in addition, growth inhibition and the breakdown of the photosynthetic machinery are commonly observed ethylene effects  <cit> .

phenanthrene interferes with hormone signaling networks
results presented here suggest that the complex physiological pah stress symptoms likely involve multiple hormone pathways, including sa, ethylene, ja, and abscisic acid . furthermore, the gus expression patterns in phenanthrene-treated ch5b::gus and atgstf2::gus lines suggest that ethylene and sa levels are locally elevated in pah-stressed plant tissues . the spatial patterns in leaves resemble previous observations of phenanthrene-induced, localized cell death and h2o2accumulation  <cit> , supporting the hypothesis that, in addition to sa, ethylene is involved in the development of the pah symptoms. interestingly, reporter activity was consistently more pronounced in pah-treated atgstf2::gus than in the ch5b::gus transgenic plants . this difference in gus expression may be caused by a differential ethylene sensitivity of the two promoters. this explanation is plausible as the ch5b promoter in transgenic arabidopsis leaves is approximately an order of magnitude less sensitive to ethylene than the endogenous basic chitinase promoter  <cit> . a further explanation for the differential reporter levels is that the two transcriptional programs involve other signals in addition to ethylene  <cit> . indeed, sa signaling is necessary for strong atgstf <dig> induction by ethylene  <cit> .

analyses of quantitative growth responses of dark-grown ethylene mutants exposed to phenanthrene revealed further interesting interactions between phenanthrene and ethylene signaling. without pah, the ethylene overproducer eto <dig> and the constitutively-signaling triple mutant grew short hypocotyls and roots, consistent with the standard model of ethylene-induced growth reduction. however, when treated with phenanthrene, these two lines grew longer roots than on control medium, suggesting that the treatment inhibits ethylene signal transduction. this hypothesis is supported by the observations that the exaggerated apical hook, which is typical in acc-treated dark-grown plants , was absent in pah-treated plants . this phenotype was frequently observed in wt plants treated with both acc and phenanthrene . the observation that typical triple-response symptoms were attenuated under phenanthrene treatment suggests that the pah negatively interferes with the ethylene signal transduction pathway or with ethylene biosynthesis in conditions of elevated ethylene levels or signaling. it has been proposed that ethylene can exhibit inhibiting or stimulating effect on growth, depending on the ethylene concentration  <cit> . furthermore, the ethylene-insensitive etr1- <dig> mutant responded to the pah with significantly stronger growth inhibition than the wt. this result clearly shows that the phenanthrene-induced growth reduction does not require ethylene signaling through the etr <dig> receptor. taken together, the mutant experiments suggest that ethylene is not required for the development of some of the pah stress symptoms, and, phenanthrene inhibits some ethylene responses under conditions of elevated ethylene levels.

integrated model of pah response in arabidopsis
with these and previous results taken in total, we propose a model of the pah response in plants. shortly following uptake, the pah molecules may be oxidized by mono- or dioxygenases into reactive compounds. an analogous biochemical process occurs in animals, catalyzed by cytochrome p450s  <cit> , producing toxic and mutagenic electrophiles. ros deriving from pah oxidation would increase the overall ros level, and thereby contribute towards activation of ros-dependent signaling pathways. alternatively, the pah molecule may be directly recognized by a receptor such as a pas-domain protein, a large and widely-distributed class of environmental sensors that includes the vertebrate aryl hydrocarbon receptor  <cit> . the strong similarities to biotic stress also suggest that the pah could be cross-reacting with a pathogen recognition system. regardless of the initial mechanism of action, the hormones sa, ethylene, and ja appear to be involved in the response, and other unidentified signals also are likely relevant. finally, the oxidized intermediates can be conjugated with a sugar or glutathione, and sequestered into the vacuole or cell wall. the initial pah or its downstream products have been shown to accumulate in trichomes and other epidermal cells  <cit> , although the recognition and transport mechanisms remain unknown.

additional studies will help elucidate causality in the complex pah stress response. it would be instructive to perform high-resolution time-series experiments to measure transcripts implicated in the earliest modes of action, as well as direct measurement of hormone levels. in addition, it would be valuable to perform tissue-specific molecular and enzyme assays, particularly of the zones implicated by the positive gus results and necrotic areas. furthermore, in addition to the ethylene mutants, the pah response in other signaling mutants should be analysed.

even though many remaining questions surround pah stress, the microarray data provide a number of leads for improving pah phytoremediation. relaxing the rate- and capacity-limiting bottlenecks in the pah detoxification pathway would reduce the cytoplasmic concentration of pahs, thereby decreasing the effective toxicity to the plant and allowing increased uptake of the pollutant. for example, further increasing gst and ugt protein levels, or artificially up-regulating vacuolar transporters of conjugated xenobiotics, may produce plants with improved phytoremediation capabilities. the present results, as well as the suggested follow-on research, will be of great value in breeding and engineering plants for phytoremediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

CONCLUSIONS
the microarray experiments and comparative analyses show that phenanthrene treatment of arabidopsis induces oxidative stress networks, closely resembling pathogen defense programs. a battery of altered transcripts revealed perturbations of the ros, hr, and sar systems. the present data support the hypothesis that the hormones sa, ethylene, and ja are involved in pah response. in total, the results provide a large number of new pathway targets for researching and engineering plants for pah phytoremediation.
