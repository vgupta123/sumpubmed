BACKGROUND
glutathione transferases , formerly known as glutathione s-transferases, are the enzymes involved in cellular detoxification by conjugating the tripeptide  glutathione  to a wide variety of substrates such as endobiotic and xenobiotic compounds  <cit> . gsts have been identified in all the organisms, including plants, animals, fungi and bacteria analyzed to date  <cit> . although most of gsts exist as soluble enzymes, distantly related mitochondrial kappa gsts and microsomal gsts have also been identified in animals  <cit> . gst proteins are represented by a multi-gene family in plants similar to other organisms  <cit> . several gsts have been identified and characterized in various plant species with differential and overlapping substrate specificities  <cit> . based on the predicted amino acid sequences, the soluble gsts in plants have been grouped into several classes, including phi, tau, lambda, dehydroascorbate reductase , theta, zeta, elongation factor  <dig> gamma  and tetrachlorohydroquinone dehalogenase . among these classes, phi, tau, lambda and dhar classes are plant specific  <cit> .

plant gsts have been a focus of attention because of their role in herbicide detoxification. some evidences showed that gsts are present at every stage of plant development from early embryogenesis to senescence and in every tissue type examined  <cit> . gsts have been found to be differentially regulated by a variety of stimuli, including abiotic and biotic stresses, plant hormones such as auxins, cytokinins and aba, heavy metals, gsh and hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . despite their suspected crucial role in stress responses and significant efforts made, the specific role of gst enzymes have not been elucidated. the role of plant gsts has also been proposed in the transport and metabolism of secondary compounds  <cit> . plant gsts can also act as glutathione peroxidases  <cit> , protect cells from oxygen toxicity  <cit>  and suppress apoptosis  <cit> . some of plant gsts were originally identified as auxin- and cytokinin-binding proteins  <cit> , pointing their role in hormone signal transduction pathways as well.

among gsts, the members of tau and phi classes are most studied in plants. the reason may be attributed to their larger number. they are dimeric and catalyze the conjugation of a diverse range of xenobiotics and detoxify selective herbicides  <cit> . theta gsts have limited transferase activity towards xenobiotics but are highly active gsh-dependent peroxidases  <cit> . zeta class gsts have been shown to differ from other gsts in showing no gsh conjugating or gsh peroxidase activity, rather these are involved in gsh-dependent tyrosine catabolism  <cit> . the recently discovered dhar class gsts are monomeric and act as gsh-dependent oxidoreductases  <cit> . ef1g class of gst proteins encodes γ subunit of eukaryotic translation elongation factor. it has been proposed that the n-terminal gst domain present in this class of proteins may be involved in mediating the assembly of ef <dig> and regulation of formation of multisubunit complexes containing ef <dig>  <cit> . another recently identified gst from arabidopsis closely resembles the tchqd enzymes from prokaryotes  <cit> . the functional characterization of this protein has not been reported.

although quite a few gst proteins have been characterized in rice, the functions of majority of members in this family remain unknown. in the first identification and classification of gst family in rice based on analysis of est database and unfinished genomic sequence, a total of  <dig> members were identified and their expression patterns analyzed by querying est databases  <cit> . in this study, the members of gst family in rice have been reanalyzed based on complete genome sequence and annotation, and a total of  <dig> putative gst genes were identified. in addition, a comprehensive expression analysis during various stages of development, hormone treatments, abiotic and biotic stress conditions, have been performed. the results reported in this study will provide a very useful reference for further functional analysis of members of this family in rice.

RESULTS
identification of genes encoding gst proteins in rice
gsts are represented by multigene family in plants. several members of gst family have been identified and divided into different classes in arabidopsis, maize and soybean  <cit> . soranzo et al  <cit>  reported the presence of  <dig> members of gst family in rice based on analysis of est database and unfinished genomic sequence and divided them into four classes. in this study, we performed domain search for the proteins containing gst n-terminal domain  in the rice genome annotation project  database  or hmm profile search against the downloaded proteome of rice. subsequently, the proteins which did not show the presence of gst_n domain  in smart analysis were eliminated. taken together, a total of  <dig> non-redundant gene loci were predicted to contain gst_n domain and encode putative gst proteins in rice. the number of gst proteins predicted in this study is  <dig> % greater than the previously reported number in rice   <cit> . a comparative analysis showed that  <dig> among the  <dig> ests/cdna clones encoding gst proteins in rice reported by soranzo et al  <cit>  correspond to the gene loci predicted in this study. the sequences for five genes  could not be retrieved as they have become obsolete entries in ncbi, osgstu <dig>  represents a viral sequence, osgstt <dig>  has been annotated as a ty1-copia subclass retrotransposon, osgst <dig>  did not show the presence of gst_n domain and osgstu <dig>  was redundant with another gst gene osgstu <dig> . in total, this study reports  <dig> new gene loci encoding gst proteins in rice as compared to soranzo et al  <cit> . the locus id, open reading frame length, protein length and chromosomal location of all the  <dig> gst genes are given in additional file  <dig> 

to reveal the evolutionary relationship among the rice gst proteins, a phylogenetic tree was generated using their full-length protein sequences . the results suggested that the rice gst family can be classified into seven classes . based on the protein sequence alignments and evolutionary relationship, largest number of gst genes  were included in tau class followed by  <dig> genes in phi, four in zeta, two in dhar, two in ef1g and one each in theta and tchqd classes. the members included in tau, phi, zeta, dhar, ef1g, theta and tchqd classes were designated as osgstu, osgstf, osgstz, osdhar, osef1g, osgstt and ostchqd, respectively, followed by a number . to keep the nomenclature of gst family consistent, the name of reported genes has been retained and the systematic names of the genes reported previously but not identified in this study were assigned to newly identified members . all the newly identified members within a class were named according to their sequential position on rice chromosomes from top to bottom.

the pairwise comparison of gst protein sequences showed considerable sequence diversity with overall identity ranging from 8% to 92%. however, relatively high identities were found among the members of same class, for example, the sequence identity among the members of tau class varied from 27% to 92% and for phi class members from 24% to 84%. the multiple sequence alignments of full-length gst protein sequences showed that n-terminal is highly conserved, which contains active site serine residue fundamental to gst activity and gsh-binding site. the active site serine residue  was conserved in all but  <dig> of the gst proteins. osgstu <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  t <dig>  dhar <dig>  dhar <dig>  ef1g <dig> and ef1g <dig> lack essential active site serine residue. an arginine residue  was also conserved in most of gst proteins. in addition, serine residue  in the gsh-binding domain was essentially conserved in all the gst proteins except osgstf <dig> and ostchqd <dig>  the additional putative conserved motifs in gst proteins were investigated using multiple em  for motif elicitation  program. we identified ten highly significant  putative conserved motifs of more than  <dig> amino acids in length present in at least ten of the gst proteins . the motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> formed a part of gst n-terminal domain. among the ten predicted putative motifs, some were specific to the members of a particular class and others were conserved in two to many classes. motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were specific to tau class only; motif  <dig> was present in members of tau and dhar class and motif  <dig> in tau and zeta class members. motif  <dig>  which harbors the active site serine residue, was present in most of members of tau, phi, zeta and tchqd classes. the members of phi, zeta, theta, ef1g and tchqd harbors motif  <dig>  motif  <dig> was present in phi, ef1g and tchqd classes, whereas motif  <dig> was present in members of phi, ef1g and dhar classes. these putative conserved motifs may provide diversity in functions of the gst proteins.

tandem duplications are responsible for the family expansion
the rice genome has undergone several rounds of genome-wide duplication events, including polyploidy, which has great impact on the expansion of a gene family in the genome. to investigate the contribution of gene duplication in the expansion of gst gene family, the chromosomal location of each gst gene was determined based on the information provided by rgap . the chromosomal localization of all members of this family indicated a non-random distribution . chromosome  <dig> was devoid of gst genes whereas chromosome  <dig> encoded highest number  of the gst family members followed by chromosome  <dig> . a total of six clusters of tandemly arranged gst genes were observed on different chromosomes. chromosome  <dig> harbors three clusters of gst genes, first cluster of seven members of phi class, second cluster of two members of tau class and third cluster of six members of tau class. the fourth cluster of  <dig> members of phi class was present on chromosome  <dig>  the fifth and largest cluster localized on chromosome  <dig> contains  <dig> tau class gst genes present in tandem at a single locus. the two zeta class gst genes formed the sixth cluster on chromosome  <dig>  this data suggested the major contribution of tandem duplications  to the gst family expansion. on the other hand, we found eight members of gst family located on the segmentally duplicated regions. since the number of gst genes located on segmentally duplicated regions is much smaller than those present in tandem, the localized gene duplications appear to have contributed a major role in expansion of this gene family.

rice genome encodes significantly higher  number of gst genes as compared to arabidopsis . to explore the expansion of gst gene family members in rice vis-à-vis arabidopsis, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the multiple sequence alignment of their full-length protein sequences . the phylogenetic tree showed that gst proteins from rice and arabidopsis belonging to the same class were clustered together. in addition, gst proteins of rice and arabidopsis within a class were usually clustered in species-specific manner. this indicates that gst proteins of each class existed before the divergence of monocots and dicots and later on expanded independently in species-specific manner. this type of species-specific expansion of other gene families has been observed as well  <cit> . furthermore, the degree of expansion of tau class varied significantly in rice and arabidopsis. only  <dig> members of tau class have been predicted in arabidopsis, whereas this class is comprised of  <dig> members in rice. it seems tandem duplication events have contributed significantly towards evolution of tau class gst genes in rice. the analysis of phylogenetic tree revealed that a major group of gst proteins comprised of  <dig> proteins within tau class present in rice was absent in arabidopsis . it may be speculated that these gst proteins were lost in arabidopsis or evolved in rice after divergence of monocots and dicots and may perform monocot specific functions. likewise, the expansion of phi, zeta and dhar classes is more in rice as compared to arabidopsis. although the zeta and theta class gsts have been suggested to represent ancestral genes, they are poorly represented in plants  <cit> . surprisingly, on the other hand, the presence of plant-specific phi and tau class gsts is more numerous. this could be explained due to the rapid evolution of phi and tau class gsts in plants, which may perform diverse plant-specific functions.

differential expression of gst gene family members in various tissues/organs
although the roles of gsts have been explored in various stress responses, the evidences for their role in plant growth and development are very limited. the overlapping and tissue-specific expression patterns of gst genes have been observed in some plant species, including rice, by querying est databases  <cit> . the study of gene expression patterns of all the members of a gene family provides insight into their functional diversification. the expression evidence for  <dig> of the rice gst genes was found in terms of the availability of their corresponding full-length cdna and/or est evidence. we surveyed the transcript accumulation of gst genes across a wide range of tissues/organs and developmental stages of rice employing two approaches. in the first approach, we used the data from rice massively parallel signature sequencing  database to quantify the expression of individual gst gene. mpss technology provides a quantitative measure of transcript accumulation of virtually all the genes in a tissue sample in terms of number of small signature sequences corresponding to each gene  <cit> . the survey of  <dig> rice mpss libraries  <cit>  representing  <dig> tissue samples showed that at least  <dig> gst genes have corresponding  <dig> base signatures, suggesting that most of the gst genes are expressed in rice. however, significant signatures  were found for  <dig> gst genes . the number of tags  for rice gst genes varied significantly, indicating marginal  to strong  expression. in addition, the number of tags revealed differential expression patterns of individual gst genes in various rice tissues/organs.

microarray represents a high throughput means to analyze the gene expression of all the members of a gene family and to identify genes involved in a particular biological process. in the second approach, we used the microarray data for various tissues/organs and developmental stages available at geo database under the accession numbers gse <dig> and gse <dig>  the series gse <dig> includes microarray data from  <dig> hybridizations representing three biological replicates each of  <dig> different tissues/organs and developmental stages  <cit> , whereas series gse <dig> includes the microarray data from  <dig> hybridizations representing  <dig> different tissue samples  <cit> . because three biological replicates were available only for stigma and ovary in the series gse <dig> dataset, only these data were used in this analysis. all the tissues/organs and developmental stages for which microarray data was analyzed in this study are summarized in additional file  <dig>  the probe sets representing gst genes on the affymetrix array were identified using rice multiplatform microarray search tool. a total of  <dig> gst genes were represented on the affymetrix arrays. there was no probe set on the arrays corresponding to the remaining gst genes. the average log signal values of  <dig> gst genes were extracted after whole-chip data processing for all the tissue samples using genespring gx software . we used tigr multi experiment viewer to perform hierarchical clustering analysis of the expression of  <dig> gst genes based on their average log signal values . distinct transcript abundance patterns of gst genes were readily identified in the microarray data analyzed. many of the gst genes showed preferential accumulation of transcripts in a given tissue/organ or developmental stage. we grouped gst genes roughly in  <dig> clusters  with similar expression patterns . the number of genes varied from one  to  <dig>  in these clusters. cluster i include  <dig> gst genes which are highly expressed and cluster viii include six very lowly expressed gst genes in all the tissues/organs or developmental stage analyzed. ten genes included in cluster x also exhibited very low expression in all/most of the tissues analyzed. the gst genes which showed very low expression in various tissues and/or developmental stages analyzed might express in specific cell-type or tissue/condition other than those included in this study. other reason for detection of very low expression of these gst genes may be attributed to the improper/hampered hybridization of their fragmented rna molecules to the oligos represented on the chip because of the presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms in the rice varieties used for microarray experiments. however, other gst genes exhibited transcript abundance in one or more distinct tissue/organ or developmental stage analyzed. the expression of few gst genes was restricted to a particular tissue/organ/developmental stage, whereas other gst genes exhibited preferential expression in narrow to wide window of developmental stages. four genes in cluster ii are expressed preferentially in root and stages of panicle development. seven gst genes  are expressed exclusively in root. the expression of osgstf <dig> is restricted to seed development stages . two genes from cluster vii, osgstf <dig> and u <dig>  were preferentially expressed during p <dig> stage of panicle development and the expression of osgstu <dig> was restricted to stigma and ovary. four genes  are expressed preferentially in vegetative tissues, late stages of panicle development and seed development stages. these genes may perform specific roles in these tissues/organs or developmental stage. the validation of differential gene expression of selected gst genes in various tissues/organs and developmental stages by real-time pcr analysis showed very good agreement with the microarray results . these results suggest the involvement of gsts in various developmental events in rice.

the expression of eight tau class gst genes  for which microarray data was not available, was explored in terms of availability of their corresponding fl-cdna, est and/or mpss tags. we found all these evidences of expression  for three gst genes  and one gst gene  had corresponding fl-cdna/est available. although mpss tags were available for other four gst genes, significant  tags were available for two  of them. among these gst genes, osgst <dig> was expressed in a wide range of tissues, whereas osgstu <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were preferentially expressed in stressed and/or non-stressed young roots . taken together, our results indicate that all the  <dig> gst genes identified in this study are expressed in one or the other rice tissue and exhibit overlapping and/or specific expression patterns with quantitative differences.

duplicated gst genes exhibit redundant and divergent expression patterns
as discussed above, we found quite a large number of duplicated gst genes in rice. gene duplication raises the question about their functional redundancy and also serves as a mechanism to increase functional diversity. after duplication, genes may undergo diversification of gene function such as neo-functionalization, sub-functionalization, non-functionalization or hypo-functionalization  <cit> . the expression patterns of duplicated genes indicate their evolutionary fates. the functional diversification has been proposed to be important for the retention of duplicated genes. to reveal the functional redundancy/diversification of duplicated gst genes, their expression patterns were analyzed. among the four gst gene pairs localized on duplicated chromosomal segments, two pairs osgstf6/f <dig> and osef1g1/ef1g <dig> exhibit similar expression patterns, whereas other two pairs osgstf12/f <dig> and osgstu51/u <dig> showed divergent expression patterns . in fact, one of the members in these gene pairs is expressed at very low level in all the tissues/organs examined suggesting their non/hypo-functionalization. among the six clusters of tandemly duplicated gst genes, the two genes included in each of cluster  <dig>  and  <dig> , exhibited highly similar expression patterns with some quantitative differences . the gst genes included in other four clusters exhibited similar to highly diverged expression patterns indicating the events of neo-, sub-, and non/hypo-functionalization . the results suggest the evolution of gst gene family has occurred by gene duplication followed by retention due to sub- or neo-functionalization of the duplicated genes.

to investigate the probable explanation for divergence in expression patterns of duplicated gst genes, we analyzed their promoter sequences  <dig> kb upstream of translational start site. the putative cis-regulatory elements were identified using place  search. this analysis revealed that the regulatory elements are more conserved in duplicated gst genes with similar expression patterns  as compared to the gst genes with divergent expression patterns . the considerable difference in the regulatory elements of duplicated genes might explain their divergent expression patterns. however, experimental validation is required to reach this conclusion. further, the existence of some other regulatory mechanism, which is responsible for divergent expression patterns and/or non-functionalization of one of the duplicates, can not be ruled out.

differential expression of gst genes during hormone treatment
some of the plant gsts are induced by plant hormones auxins and cytokinins. the transcript level of gst genes is induced very rapidly in the presence of auxin  <cit> . in this study, we used two microarray datasets to assess the effect of auxin and cytokinin on the expression profiles of gst genes. first dataset includes microarray analysis of 7-day-old rice seedlings treated with indole-3-acetic acid  and benzyl aminopurine  up to  <dig> h each  <cit> . second dataset includes microarray analysis of root and leaf tissues of two-week-old seedlings treated with trans-zeatin  for  <dig> min and  <dig> min  <cit> . the data analysis showed that a total of  <dig> gst genes exhibit significant differential expression under at least one of the conditions analyzed . interestingly, majority  of them belonged to tau class. quite a large number  of gst genes showed differential expression in the presence of auxin. all but one  of these  <dig> genes were up-regulated significantly. a total of  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in the presence of cytokinin. three genes which showed up-regulation in the presence of bap in first dataset did not show any differential expression in the presence of tz in second dataset. among the  <dig> genes which showed differential expression in the second dataset,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in roots as compared to  <dig> in leaf. five genes showed differential expression both in roots and leaf, whereas six and ten genes were unique to root and leaf, respectively. these results suggest the differential response of rice gst genes with respect to age of seedlings, tissue-type and/or cytokinin type. the differential expression of some representative genes in the presence of iaa and/or bap has also been validated by real-time pcr analysis .

differential expression of gst genes during abiotic stress
many gsts have been implicated in various abiotic stress responses in plants. the differential expression of several arabidopsis gsts in response to ethylene, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, hydrogen peroxide and  <dig>  4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid have been reported  <cit> . to study the effect of various abiotic stresses  on the expression profiles of gst genes, microarray data available under series accession number gse <dig>  <cit>  was analyzed. differential expression analysis for rice seedlings treated with different abiotic stresses  as compared to mock-treated control seedlings was performed. this analysis showed that at least  <dig> gst genes  were differentially expressed significantly under at least one of the abiotic stress conditions analyzed. among these, three gst genes were differentially expressed in all the stress conditions . other  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in any two stress conditions. however, six genes showed differential expression under only specific stress condition. one gene  which was down-regulated by desiccation stress was up-regulated by cold stress. similarly, we analyzed the microarray data for arsenate stress from an earlier study  <cit> . the data included expression analysis from rice varieties azucena  and bala  grown in the presence or absence of  <dig>  μm sodium arsenate for  <dig> days. the data analysis showed that a large number  of gst genes  showed significant differential expression in response to arsenate stress as compared to other abiotic stress  . a total of  <dig> gst genes were significantly up-regulated, whereas four genes were down-regulated in azucena. in bala,  <dig> genes were up-regulated and four genes were down-regulated. twenty two gst genes were significantly up-regulated and four were down-regulated both in azucena and bala. furthermore,  <dig> gst genes were commonly differentially expressed under various abiotic and arsenate stress conditions analyzed in this study. the real-time pcr analysis confirmed the differential expression of representative gst genes during various abiotic stress conditions and arsenate stress .

differential expression of gst genes during biotic stress
gsts have been shown to be differentially regulated upon pathogen attack in several plant species  <cit> . one of the most serious and widespread diseases of rice is blast caused by the ascomycete fungus magnaporthe grisea. recently, a transcriptome analysis of a fully susceptible infection of rice  by a compatible m. grisea isolate  was performed to understand the molecular mechanism involved in their interaction  <cit> . we analyzed this data to have inkling about the role of rice gst genes in this host-pathogen interaction. the data includes microarray analysis of two-week-old rice seedlings  treated with m. grisea  spore suspension on gelatine or gelatine alone after  <dig> days  and  <dig> days  post inoculation. the data analysis revealed that quite a large number  of gst genes are differentially expressed more than 2-fold . among these, only  <dig> genes showed differential expression at  <dig> dpi, whereas  <dig> genes at  <dig> dpi .

striga hermonthica is an obligate root hemiparasite of rice and other cereals that causes severe loss of yield. to understand the possible interaction between rice roots and parasitic plant s. hermonthica at molecular level, global gene expression profiling was performed by swarbrick and colleagues  <cit> . we took advantage of the availability of this data to study the expression profiles of rice gst genes in roots of susceptible  and highly resistant  cultivars in response to infection with s. hermonthica after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi. the data analysis revealed that at least  <dig> genes were significantly up- and down-regulated by more than 2-fold in nipponbare as compared with  <dig> genes in susceptible iac <dig> cultivar . in iac <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively, whereas nine and eight gst genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively, in nipponbare. twelve gst genes showed differential expression in both cultivars. among the total  <dig> gst genes differentially expressed in two datasets,  <dig> genes belonged to tau class,  <dig> to phi, two to zeta, two to ef1g and one each to dhar and tchqd classes.

overlap of gst responses to various stimuli and developmental processes
the overlap of response of gst genes to various stimuli, including hormone, abiotic stress  and biotic stress, and developmental processes was analyzed. a global figure including the expression profiles of all the  <dig> gst genes for which microarray data was available, during various stages of development and under various environmental stimuli analyzed in this study, was generated . it is noteworthy that among a total of  <dig> gst genes, which were differentially expressed in the presence of any of these three environmental stimuli ,  <dig> genes showed response to all of these stimuli . other  <dig> gst genes responded to any of the two stimuli. however,  <dig> gst genes showed response to specific stimuli . some of the gst family members were induced by multiple stresses, while others showed response to few to unique stress condition. for example, osgstf <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig> and u <dig> were induced by abiotic, arsenate and biotic stresses analyzed in this study. however, osgstu <dig>  u <dig>  tchqd <dig> exhibited response to abiotic and biotic stresses, but were non-responsive to arsenate stress. likewise, osgstu <dig> responded specifically to abiotic stress, osgstu <dig> and u <dig> to arsenate stress and osgstf <dig>  f <dig> and u <dig> to biotic stress. in general, the members of tau class appeared to show response to various stimuli more frequently. however, 71%  of phi class gst genes responded to biotic stress as compared to 58%  of tau class. the expression of two gst genes of tau class, osgstu <dig> and u <dig>  was found to be induced by heavy metals, hypoxic stress and salt stress  <cit> . we also found that the transcript levels of these genes are induced by desiccation, salt and cold stress. in addition, our analysis revealed that the transcript levels of these genes are induced in the presence of arsenate and biotic stress as well, indicating their role in broad spectrum stress responses.

given that plant gsts are induced by a plethora of environmental factors, it was proposed that gst expression is universally induced by the production of stress-associated active oxygen species  signaling molecules, which in turn counteracts the adverse effects of aos by their gsh-dependent peroxidase activity  <cit> . however, our study showed that, although several gsts are commonly regulated, many of them exhibit differential and specific response to various stresses as well. similar observations have been reported in other studies too  <cit> . these results indicate that the induction of gst family members occurs via multiple and independent pathways and a subset of which may involve aos as signaling molecules. it has been reported that gsts are induced very rapidly by pathogens and typically precede the induction of well-known defense genes such as pathogenesis-related proteins  <cit> . based on analysis of mutants, this rapid induction of gsts has been found to be dependent on combined sa- and ethylene signaling  <cit> . this was further supported by the increased production of sa and ethylene by the plants inoculated with pathogen  <cit> . this clearly indicates a cross-talk between various signaling pathways.

many evidences show crosstalk between various developmental processes and environmental stimuli  <cit> . we also found relation between tissue-/developmental stage-specific expression pattern and stress responses of few gst genes. for example, osgstu <dig> is preferentially expressed in the root and stages of seed development and was also found to be highly up-regulated by plant hormones, abiotic stress, arsenate stress and biotic stress conditions. likewise, osgstu <dig> and osgstu <dig> are preferentially expressed in root and are also up-regulated by auxin and various stress conditions. the osgstf <dig> was specifically expressed in root and was down-regulated by most of the environmental stimuli analyzed in this study. other gst genes, osgstu <dig>  u <dig> and u <dig>  which were preferentially expressed in root, were also down-regulated by one or more of the stimuli. these commonly regulated gst genes might mediate plant growth responses to various environmental stimuli in specific tissues/organs and/or developmental stage.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides not only an updated annotation and nomenclature of the gst family in rice, but also the identification of several tissue- and/or developmental stage-specific, hormone-responsive and abiotic and biotic stress-responsive gst genes included in various classes. considering the fact that a very limited number of gst genes have been characterized till date, our results provide a very useful framework and starting point for revealing the function of gst family members in rice, especially those involved in specific developmental processes, hormone response and stress tolerance.
