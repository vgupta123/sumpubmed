BACKGROUND
a growing body of evidence supports the critical role of amyloid beta peptide  <dig> in alzheimer's disease  pathogenesis. early onset ad is associated with overproduction of the 42-amino acid form of aβ  and aβ1– <dig> is toxic to neurons in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . to develop therapeutic strategies for reducing neuronal loss in ad, much effort has been extended to determine the molecular interactions underlying aβ-induced neurotoxicity. several lines of evidence suggest that calcium plays a key role in age-related changes in the brain that lead to ad and dementia  <cit> . free intracellular calcium is a key activator of many signal transduction pathways of neurons, and alterations in intracellular calcium homeostasis are pivotal regulators of brain aging, memory and cell death  <cit> . according to a "calcium hypothesis" of ad, disturbances in calcium homeostasis are the proximal cause of neurodegeneration in ad, in which calcium dysfunction augments tau hyperphosphorylation, aβ formation and neurotoxicity  <cit> .

calcium  transients in neurons are largely determined by mitochondria due to their large ca2+ capacity  <cit> . mitochondrial ca2+ uptake is driven by the mitochondrial membrane potential  and occurs at the threshold of cytosolic ca2+, followed by slow release, leading to a net accumulation of mitochondrial calcium  and an alteration of physiological i transients  <cit> . mitochondrial dysfunction often leads to dysregulation of ca2+ homeostasis and consequent adverse downstream effects, including further damage to mitochondria setting up the mitochondrial spiral that is associated with multiple central nervous system disorders  <cit> . during aging, especially during the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including ad, damaged mitochondria are unable to maintain the energy demands of the cell  <cit> . this can lead to an increased production of free radicals, which induces the interruption of oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in decreased levels of atp that are necessary for normal energy homeostasis  <cit> . apoptosis of degenerating neurons occurs in association with an accumulation of abnormal mitochondria in perikaryal regions and oxidative damage to the nucleus  <cit> . the same pattern of mitochondria lesions is observed in human ad brain biopsy samples  <cit> . thus, therapeutic interventions that promote mitochondrial function could be a strategy to prevent neuronal dysfunction and death.

a prevention mode of estrogen exposure can prevent neurotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . many of the proximate effects of estrogen treatment that have been associated with estrogen-induced neuroprotection converge upon the mitochondria  <cit> . we have previously shown that estrogen-induced neuroprotection is mediated through regulation of calcium homeostasis  <cit> . further, we have shown that 17β-estradiol restores calcium homeostasis in neurons from middle-aged and old rats  <cit> . that the estrogen-induced regulation of calcium homeostasis is dependent upon maintenance of mitochondrial respiration and ΔΨm  <cit>  indicates a direct role of mitochondria in the neuroprotective effects of estrogen.

in the present study, we investigated the mechanisms whereby 17β-estradiol  exposure can prevent aβ-induced neuronal apoptosis and mitochondrial function. results of these analyses indicate that e <dig> protects rat hippocampal neurons against aβ toxicity and that such protection is associated with maintenance of calcium homeostasis, a decrease of cytochrome c release, a decrease of bax translocation to the mitochondria and enhanced mitochondrial respiratory function. these data together with previously published findings indicate that e <dig> exposure prior to aβ insult leads to a complex array of responses that coalesce in an organized cellular strategy to prevent loss of mitochondrial calcium homeostasis while simultaneously promoting bcl- <dig> family protein strategies that prevent opening of the membrane permeability transition pore.

RESULTS
17β-estradiol prevents amyloid beta-induced neuronal death
to determine the impact of 17β-estradiol  on aβ neurotoxicity,  <dig> day old rat primary hippocampal neurons with elaborate neurite networks were treated with e <dig>  for  <dig> hr prior to exposure to fibrillar aβ1– <dig>  for  <dig> hr in the continued presence of e <dig>  the concentration of  <dig> ng/ml of e <dig> was used based on multiple prior analyses indicating that this concentration induces maximal neuroprotection and the least degree of variability between experiments  <cit> . calceinam and ethidium homodimer staining, which reflect neuronal survival and death, respectively, indicated neuronal death following  <dig> hr exposure to aβ1– <dig>  compared to vehicle control-treated cultures . aβ1– <dig> exposure significantly decreased neuronal survival  as indicated by a decrease in the calcein signal  and an increase in the amount of ethidium homodimer signal . e <dig>  had no effect on neuronal survival in the absence of aβ1– <dig> . pretreatment of hippocampal neurons with e <dig>  significantly reduced the amount of aβ1–42-induced neurotoxicity , as indicated by the significant attenuation of the aβ1–42-induced neuronal death as indicated by increased calcein fluorescence  and decreased ethidium homodimer fluorescence . following  <dig> hr of aβ exposure, neurites were thickened and beaded and there was an increase in the number of phase bright cells, indicative of neuronal death compared to vehicle control and e2-treated neurons .

to determine if e2-induced alterations in neuronal survival were mediated via regulation of apoptosis, tunel staining was performed to identify apoptotic nuclei in response to aβ1– <dig> in the presence and absence of e <dig> . primary hippocampal neurons were pretreated with e <dig>  or vehicle control for  <dig> hr prior to aβ1– <dig>  exposure for  <dig> days in the continued presence of e <dig> or vehicle control. aβ1– <dig> exposure resulted in a significant increase in the number of tunel-positive neurons . e <dig> treatment prior to aβ1– <dig> exposure resulted in a significantly lower percentage of tunel-positive neurons than observed in response to aβ1– <dig> exposure in vehicle control treated neurons, indicating that e2-treatment significantly reduced the amount of aβ1–42-induced apoptosis . e <dig> alone had no significant effect on the percentage tunel-positive neurons .

17β-estradiol prevents amyloid beta1–42-induced dysregulation of calcium homeostasis
one potential mechanism of aβ1–42-induced neurotoxicity is dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, which leads to an increased cytosolic calcium load and can result in neuronal dysfunction and death  <cit> . we have previously shown that estrogen-induced neuroprotection against glutamate excitotoxicity is mediated via regulation of neuronal calcium homeostasis  <cit>  and that 17β-estradiol can both promote and restore calcium homeostasis in neurons derived from middle aged and aged rat hippocampi  <cit> . to determine if e2-induced neuroprotection against aβ1– <dig> is likewise due to regulation of calcium homeostasis, we conducted fura <dig> calcium imaging to assess the effect of aβ1– <dig> on basal neuronal calcium loads in the presence and absence of e <dig> . hippocampal neurons were pretreated with e <dig>  or vehicle control for  <dig> hr prior to aβ1– <dig> exposure for  <dig> hr. aβ1– <dig> exposure resulted in a significant increase in the resting cytosolic calcium concentration . e <dig> pretreatment significantly attenuated the aβ1–42-induced rise in resting calcium concentration fig. 3; p <  <dig>  as compared to aβ1– <dig> alone; n = 4). e <dig> by itself had no significant effect on resting calcium concentration .

17β-estradiol prevents amyloid beta1–42-induced depletion of mitochondrial bcl-2
bcl- <dig> is well established as an anti-apoptotic protein in neurons that can avert neuronal death and protect mitochondria against toxin-induced dysfunction  <cit> . it has been shown that aβ down regulates bcl- <dig> in human primary neurons  <cit> . further, bcl- <dig> is an estrogen-responsive protein  <cit> . it has also been suggested that bcl- <dig> is involved in maintenance of cellular calcium homeostasis  <cit> . to determine if mitochondrial expression of this key regulator of apoptosis was involved in e2-induced neuroprotection, we determined the effect of e <dig> and aβ1– <dig> on bcl- <dig> expression in the mitochondrial fraction of rat primary hippocampal neurons. neurons were pretreated with e <dig>  or vehicle control for  <dig> hr prior to exposure to aβ1– <dig>  for  <dig> hr. crude mitochondrial fractions were assessed for bcl- <dig> expression by western blot analysis. exposure to aβ1– <dig> resulted in a significant decrease  in bcl- <dig> expression in the mitochondrial fraction . as expected, e <dig> by itself significantly increased  mitochondrial bcl- <dig> expression . pretreatment of neurons with e <dig> completely prevented aβ1–42-induced decrease in mitochondrial bcl- <dig> .

17β-estradiol prevents amyloid beta1–42-induced translocation of bax
neurotoxicity resulting from apoptosis often results from the induction of bax translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondria where it can mediate the release of apoptotic factors such as cytochrome c  <cit> . to determine if the neuroprotective effect of e <dig> is associated with regulation of bax translocation or cytochrome c release, primary hippocampal neurons were pretreated with e <dig>  or vehicle control for  <dig> hr prior to aβ1– <dig>  exposure for  <dig> hr and assessed for bax localization by western blot and immunocytochemical analyses.

aβ1– <dig> exposure resulted in a significant increase in bax immunoreactivity in the mitochondrial fraction . e <dig> pretreatment significantly attenuated the aβ1–42-induced increase in bax immunoreactivity in the mitochondrial fraction . in contrast to the mitochondrial fraction there was no change in bax immunoreactivity in the cytosolic fraction . to confirm the shift in subcellular localization of bax, we performed immunoflourescent staining for bax. in control neurons, the bax immunofluorescence signal was diffuse throughout the cell body and neurites . in aβ1–42-treated cells the bax immunofluorescence signal was punctate, consistent with a shift to mitochondrial localization . pretreatment of hippocampal neurons with e <dig> prevented aβ1–42-induced translocation of bax, resulting in a diffuse cytosolic staining pattern with slight areas of clustering consistent with partial mitochondrial translocation .

17β-estradiol prevents amyloid beta1–42-induced release of cytochrome c
to determine the consequences of regulation of bcl- <dig> and translocation of bax, we determined the impact of e <dig> pretreatment and aβ1– <dig> exposure on cytochrome c release from mitochondria. aβ1– <dig> exposure resulted in a significant increase in cytochrome c immunoreactivity in the cytosolic fraction . e <dig> pretreatment significantly attenuated the aβ1–42-induced increase in cytochrome c immunoreactivity in the cytosolic fraction while having no effect alone . there was a corresponding significant decrease in cytochrome c immunoreactivity in the mitochondrial fraction in response to aβ1– <dig>  that was prevented by e <dig> pretreatment . to confirm the subcellular localization of cytochrome c in our conditions, neurons were double stained for cytochrome c and mitochondria . in control neurons cytochrome c immunofluorescence  exhibited a punctate staining pattern that overlapped  with the mitochondrial localization signal  . aβ1– <dig> exposure resulted in a diminution of the punctuate labeling of cytochrome c immunofluorescence  particularly in the soma while the sparse neuritic labeling for cytochrome c labeling remained. however, the neuritic labeling for cytochrome c was not co-localized with the mitochondrial localization signal  indicating release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria . the cytochrome c immunofluorescence  in the e <dig> pretreated and aβ1– <dig> exposed neurons exhibited a punctate staining pattern that overlapped  with the mitochondrial localization signal , as in the control cultures .

to determine the relationship between cytochrome c release and bax translocation, hippocampal neurons were assessed for bax and cytochrome c expression by double immunofluorescence . in control neurons the bax immunofluorescence signal  was diffuse and, as above, the cytochrome c immunofluorescence signal  was punctate , consistent with cytosolic bax and mitochondrial cytochrome c. in aβ1–42-treated cells the bax immunofluorescence signal  was punctate, consistent with a shift to mitochondrial localization, and, as above, the cytochrome c immunofluorescence signal  was diminished with a diffuse localization . pretreatment of hippocampal neurons with e <dig> prevented aβ1–42-induced translocation of bax and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria .

17β-estradiol prevents neurotoxic-induced decline in mitochondria respiration
we sought to determine if the e <dig> treatment that prevented the aβ1–42-induced alterations in mitochondrial-associated proteins of primary hippocampal neurons affected brain mitochondria in vivo. an increased mitochondrial calcium capacity should coincide with an enhanced ability to withstand calcium load and in parallel a sustained mitochondrial respiratory function. whole brain mitochondria were isolated and assessed for respiratory function in the presence of glutamate and malate as respiratory substrates following a  <dig> min challenge with  <dig> μm ca2+. oxygen consumption during state  <dig>  respiration was not affected by the presence or absence of calcium  in control mitochondria . although mitochondrial calcium overload can result in an uncoupling effect that would be expected to increase state  <dig> respiration, this was relatively unchanged in these experiments, consistent with previously published results  <cit> . oxygen consumption during state  <dig>  respiration was significantly decreased following ca2+ challenge in control brain mitochondria relative to ca2+ naive mitochondria . there was a likewise decrease  in the respiratory control ratio  following ca2+ challenge of control mitochondria . rcr values determined using atractyloside to induce state  <dig> respiration following adp depletion were indistinguishable from those calculated using basal state  <dig> respiration readings .

to determine if e2-treatment serves a protective function against increased calcium loads, mitochondrial respiratory function was assessed following a  <dig> min calcium exposure in the presence of glutamate and malate. ovariectomized adult rats were administered e <dig>  or vehicle control   <dig> hr prior to mitochondrial isolation from whole brain tissue. brain mitochondria from e2-treated rats displayed significantly greater oxygen consumption following ca2+ challenge in state  <dig> respiration and a significantly higher rcr than mitochondria from control rats . further there was a smaller decrease in the rcr values following ca2+ challenge in the brain mitochondria from e2-treated rats than control .

discussion
neurodegenerative diseases, like alzheimer's disease, are associated with disruption of calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction leading to apoptotic events and neuronal cell death. previously we demonstrated that 17β-estradiol protects against age-related calcium dysregulation  <cit> . in this study we show that estrogen pretreatment prevents amyloid beta-induced calcium dysregulation, mitochondrial failure and resultant apoptosis in hippocampal neuronal cultures. these results are consistent with previous data that demonstrate that estrogen is neuroprotective against aβ-induced neurotoxicity  <cit> , but further the field by providing evidence for the underlying mechanism of e2-induced neuroprotection through regulation of mitochondrial signals that initiate and activate apoptotic processes.

during aging, especially during the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including alzheimer's disease , damaged mitochondria are unable to maintain the energy demands of the cell. interrupted energy metabolism is observed in many instances of neurodegeneration  <cit> , including cerebral ischemia and alzheimer's disease  <cit> , two neurological conditions that account for the majority of all neurodegenerative conditions. reductions in cerebral metabolic rate often occur before the development of clinical disabilities. impairment of oxidative energy metabolism leads to increased expression of amyloid precursor protein   <cit>  and to cytoskeletal disorganization, including the appearance of epitopes associated with paired helical filaments/tangles  <cit> . this can lead to an increased production of free radicals, which induces the interruption of oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in decreased levels of atp that are necessary for normal energy homeostasis. subsequently, cerebral metabolism may be unable to meet the energy demands required to restore dissipated membrane potentials, as atp in the injured brain is significantly reduced. furthermore, a limited energy supply is evident from the reductions in mitochondrial oxygen consumption, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial enzymatic activity. in this study we demonstrated that e <dig> prevented the neurotoxic-induced decline in mitochondrial respiratory function. this is consistent with the previous reports that e <dig> is protective against cell death induced by energy depletion  <cit>  and blocks the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential induced by aβ in pc <dig> cells  <cit> . thus e <dig> may be able to prevent interruption of neuronal energy metabolism associated with neurodegeneration and may reduce app expression and paired helical filament formation.

underlying the neurodegeneration-associated mitochondrial dysfunction appears to be dysregulation of calcium homeostasis. several lines of evidence suggest that calcium plays a key role in age-related changes in the brain that lead to ad and dementia. free intracellular calcium is one of the most important messengers for many signal transduction pathways of neurons, and alterations in intracellular calcium homeostasis are critically involved in brain aging, memory and cell death. landfield's group showed that altered intracellular calcium is directly correlated with impaired neuronal plasticity such that elevated intracellular calcium and frequency facilitation were negatively correlated in individual old neurons within hippocampal slices  <cit> . this finding led these investigators to postulate that intracellular calcium is likely elevated in old hippocampal neurons and frequency facilitation would thus be impaired in old hippocampal neurons during the theta frequencies associated with cognitive processing. consistent with this postulate are recent in vivo data from studies in old rats. foy and colleagues found that e <dig> suppressed the calcium-dependent induction of long-term depression in ca <dig> hippocampal neurons of old rats  <cit> . a later analysis by foster and co-workers showed that e <dig> decreased the ca2+-activated afterhyperpolarization which is larger in old rats compared to young rat ca <dig> neurons and is enhanced by a higher density of l-type calcium channels in the old rat neuron  <cit> . more recently we have shown that estrogen can reverse the age-associated calcium dysregulation in primary neuronal cultures obtained from the hippocampus of aged rats  <cit> .

according to a "calcium hypothesis" of ad, arising from numerous preclinical in vitro studies, disturbances in calcium homeostasis are the proximal cause of neurodegeneration in ad  <cit> . there is a large body of evidence from preclinical experimental models and from human subjects that alterations in calcium signalling occur during initial phases of ad, even before the development of overt symptoms or any obvious extracellular amyloid-beta pathology  <cit> . in the current studies, we showed that e <dig> pretreatment prevented the aβ-induced rise in resting calcium concentration in primary hippocampal neurons, an effect similar to the e2-mediated reduction in calcium rise induced by excitotoxic glutamate  <cit> . more recently we have shown that estrogen can reverse the age-associated calcium dysregulation in primary neuronal cultures obtained from the hippocampus of aged rats  <cit> . a mitochondrial site of action for estrogen-mediated neuroprotection is supported by the functional mitochondria dependence of the attenuation of the glutamate-induced ca2+ rise  <cit> .

one mechanism by which estrogen may regulate mitochondrial calcium homeostasis and maintain energy metabolism is via the antiapoptotic protein bcl- <dig>  the magnitude of ca2+ accumulation by mitochondria can be altered by bcl- <dig>  <cit> , which is localized to the mitochondrial membrane and its expression has been shown to significantly enhance mitochondrial ca2+ sequestration  <cit> . in the current studies we demonstrated that e <dig> increases, and prevents the aβ-induced decrease in, the mitochondrial expression of bcl- <dig>  consistent with previous reports of e2-induced increases in bcl- <dig> in reproductive tissues and brain  <cit> . in addition to increasing the magnitude of ca2+ sequestered by mitochondria, bcl- <dig> enhances the tolerability of mitochondria for increased levels of i that otherwise result in dissipation of ΔΨm and cell death  <cit> . consistent with the increase in mitochondrial ca2+ load tolerability demonstrated here, mattson et al. showed that a supraphysiological concentration of e <dig>  can preserve ΔΨm in pc <dig> cells expressing mutant presenilin that were exposed to aβ  <cit> . we propose that by increasing m uptake capacity, and the bcl-2-induced resistance to ca2+-induced respiratory inhibition, e <dig> prevents bax translocation and cytochrome c release, limiting the loss of viability initiated by neurotoxic insults.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have shown that e <dig> provides neuroprotection in rat hippocampal neurons subjected to aβ toxicity and that such protection is associated with maintenance of calcium homeostasis, a decrease of cytochrome c release, a decrease of bax translocation to the mitochondria and enhanced mitochondrial respiratory function. taken together these data indicate that mechanisms of estrogen-inducible neuroprotection against degenerative insults are a function of estrogen activation of cellular mechanisms whose ultimate outcome is promotion of mitochondrial viability. thus mitochondria are ideal therapeutic targets of estrogen and estrogen-like surrogates in brain. further elucidation of the mitochondrial sites of estrogen action will allow for development of selective therapeutic agents for use in estrogen therapy for prevention of neurodegenerative diseases.
