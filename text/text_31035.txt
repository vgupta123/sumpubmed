BACKGROUND
muscle fibres are terminally differentiated; therefore a population of quiescent satellite cells exists. these cells are thought to be responsible for postnatal muscle growth and injury-induced muscle regeneration  <cit> . satellite cells are undifferentiated mononuclear cells, located within the basal lamina of the muscle fibre and reside in a dormant state until they are activated by physical activity or injury  <cit> . upon activation they re-enter the cell cycle. proliferating myoblasts expand their cytoplasmic-nuclei ratio and begin to fuse to existing fibres or with themselves to initiate de novo myofibre synthesis  <cit> . muscle development is critically dependent on a family of myogenic regulatory factors  including myod, myf <dig>  myf <dig> and myogenin. they are temporally expressed to regulate the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts, and often display overlapping roles. myod and myf <dig> are expressed in actively proliferating cells prior to differentiation, while the expression of myogenin and myf <dig> indicates that myoblasts have irreversibly withdrawn from the cell cycle and have commenced differentiation  <cit> .

numerous intracellular signaling pathways and molecules have been found to play several roles in myogenic differentiation. these include mapk and erk, which elicit different signals to promote or inhibit differentiation and fusion  <cit> . in addition, pi3k/akt is utilized by igf to stimulate differentiation while other growth factors such as hgf and fgf- <dig> enhance proliferation  <cit> . the jak/stat signaling cascade also appears to be an integral factor for myoblast development, known to be activated by il- <dig> and lif  <cit> . jak family members, jak <dig> and jak <dig>  are the most commonly used non-receptor tyrosine kinases. seven stat members exist, stat1- <dig>  stat5a, 5b and  <dig>  yet stat <dig> was the first to be implicated in proliferation in vitro  <cit>  and in vivo  <cit> . recently in rodent models, specific roles have been defined for several jak and stat members. it was demonstrated that jak1/stat1/stat <dig> signaling is involved in myoblast proliferation preventing premature differentiation  <cit> . however, jak2/stat2/stat <dig> appears to positively regulate differentiation indicating that stat <dig> elicits specific responses at various times during myogenesis  <cit> .

the temporal responsiveness of jak/stat signaling in humans is largely unknown. therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the expression of jak/stat signaling molecules in vitro during human myoblast differentiation. near confluent proliferating myoblasts were induced to differentiate for  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> days. during these developmental stages, members of the jak/stat family were examined, along with factors known to regulate myogenesis. it was hypothesized that stat <dig> signaling would be elevated during myogenesis as it is essential for both proliferation and differentiation in murine cells, and we expected stat <dig> phosphorylation to be restricted to proliferation.

RESULTS
myoblasts undergoing differentiation display a typical genetic profile
phenotypically, the cells used in these experiments were successfully undergoing differentiation . proliferating cells demonstrated a high nuclei-cytoplasmic ratio . serum depletion initiated differentiation, where myoblasts became elongated  and fused with nearby cells to form multinucleated tubes . following  <dig> days of serum depletion, large myotubes were evident with a low number of single nuclei myoblasts remaining .

to confirm these observations, the mrna expression of genes known to be involved in myogenesis were investigated; cyclind <dig> , myod , myogenin , α-actin , emhc  and socs <dig>  . cyclind <dig> was significantly decreased following the initiation of differentiation . myod expression increased  <dig> -fold at the onset of differentiation  . by day  <dig> and  <dig>  myod was below the level observed in proliferating cells . myogenin expression was 870- and 585-fold higher  than that seen in proliferating cells . α-actin and emhc were measured as markers of myotube growth. α-actin and emhc were significantly higher in differentiating myoblasts compared to both proliferating and day  <dig> cells . finally, socs <dig> mrna expression displayed a significant decrease at the onset of differentiation , however this was again elevated by day  <dig> of differentiation , thereafter it returned to the level observed during proliferation.

elements of stat signaling are differentially expressed during myogenesis
to investigate stat signaling during human myoblast differentiation, we measured the phosphorylation of stat family members stat <dig> and stat <dig> as well as the negative regulator, socs <dig>  tyr <dig> phosphorylation increased during myoblast differentiation , which was accompanied by a concomitant increase in total stat <dig> . similarly there was an increase in total stat <dig> during differentiation ; however phosphorylation of tyr <dig> was only evident in proliferating myoblasts . interestingly, unlike socs <dig> mrna, socs <dig> protein levels remained unchanged during myoblast development . phosphorylation of upstream kinases, jak <dig> and jak <dig> was measured; jak <dig> phosphorylation at tyr1022/ <dig> was only evident in proliferating cells while tyr1007/ <dig> phosphorylation of jak <dig> appeared to increase during differentiation. to confirm the commitment of myoblasts to differentiation, myogenin protein expression was also measured; this was only evident in day  <dig> and day  <dig> cells. actin was used as a loading control .

discussion
due to the complexity of intracellular signaling, the molecular mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle development remain partially understood. it is widely accepted that myogenesis is critically dependent on mrfs, however numerous other signaling pathways have been found to be influential on myogenic differentiation. therefore, it is important to investigate the signaling pathways that may be involved in the structural remodeling of skeletal muscle. jak/stat is now recognized as a critical pathway needed for efficient muscle fibre adaptation. in murine cell models, it was identified that the jak1/stat1/stat <dig> axis is involved in myoblast proliferation preventing the premature differentiation into myotubes  <cit> . however, it is jak2/stat2/stat <dig> that appears to positively regulate differentiation, indicating that stat <dig> elicits specific responses at various times during myogenesis  <cit> , possibly via jak/stat co-operating with various ligands to initiate distinct cellular responses.

primary human muscle cells provide an appropriate experimental model that has human physiologic relevance. therefore, using primary human skeletal myoblasts, we sought to corroborate the results obtained in murine cells  <cit> . near confluent myoblasts were exposed to low serum media to induce differentiation for  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> days. the expression profile of jak/stat family members was investigated in conjunction with factors known to regulate myogenesis. as the myoblasts were undergoing differentiation, they displayed a typical genetic expression profile. mrfs are temporally expressed to regulate the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts. myod is expressed in actively proliferating cells prior to differentiation, followed by increased myogenin expression at the beginning of differentiation  <cit> . at the onset of differentiation there is also a withdrawal from the cell cycle, represented by changes in expression of cell cycle regulators. as myofibres mature, they begin to fuse to form multinucleated muscle cells which is accompanied by the expression of mhc and α-actin  <cit> . in primary human skeletal myoblasts, stat <dig> tyr <dig> phosphorylation increased during myoblast differentiation, which was accompanied by an apparent elevation in endogenous stat <dig>  indicating a role during both the proliferative and differentiation phases. stat <dig> elevations were associated with unchanged socs <dig> protein expression during the time course. however, socs <dig> mrna expression was significantly lower at day  <dig> of differentiation compared to proliferating and day  <dig> differentiated muscle cells, consistent with earlier studies  <cit> ; further highlighting the importance of stat <dig> signaling during the onset of differentiation.

unlike stat <dig>  stat <dig> tyr <dig> phosphorylation was only evident during proliferation despite endogenous stat <dig> protein increasing during differentiation. in murine cells, it has been demonstrated that stat <dig> is important for proliferation, therefore it was expected that we would observe stat <dig> activity only during this stage. however, it has been described that stat <dig> activation can often reduce proliferation  <cit> . accordingly, it may be reasonable to assume that stat <dig> phosphorylation during proliferation occurs when it complexes with stat <dig> to prevent myoblast differentiation  <cit> ; yet when cells undergo differentiation, stat <dig> may be acting alone to inhibit myoblast proliferation  <cit> .

upstream of stats are gp <dig>  and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, jak <dig> and jak <dig>  previously it has been demonstrated that jak <dig> and jak <dig> have differential roles during murine myoblast differentiation despite their high homology; jak <dig> is essential for proliferation, while jak <dig> is necessary for differentiation  <cit> . in this study, jak <dig> phosphorylation was only present in proliferating myoblasts; this is consistent with its role in proliferation as described in rodent models  <cit> . jak <dig> was phosphorylated during each time point, which was unexpected given its reported role in differentiation  <cit> . however, this may indicate that there was a population of myoblasts that were spontaneously differentiating, in the proliferating sample. this may also account for the higher than expected expression of myod observed in the proliferating cells.

CONCLUSIONS
the current study demonstrates that stat signaling during myogenesis is similar in humans as to what has been described in rodents. importantly, as stat <dig> plays an integral role in myoblast maturation and skeletal muscle adaptation, we observed an increase in stat <dig> tyr <dig> phosphorylation during differentiation which was accompanied by an apparent elevation in endogenous stat <dig>  although our results are similar to that demonstrated in rodents, our observations alone should not be used to definitively identify the role of jak/stat signaling in human skeletal myogenesis; further mechanistic investigation is warranted to clearly define the importance of this pathway in human skeletal muscle development, similar to that which has been performed in murine models  <cit> . additionally, as this pathway is critical for myogenesis, it may be an appropriate therapeutic target for diseases with impaired muscular adaptation and regeneration.
