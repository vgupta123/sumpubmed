BACKGROUND
the myb superfamily exemplifies how both conserved and divergent domains are present within a transcription factor family. myb genes are exclusive to eukaryotes  <cit>  and although in animals their function is restricted to the control of the cell division and differentiation  <cit> , they have diverse functions in plants  <cit> .

myb genes in plants are modulated by diverse hormones  <cit>  and participate in key processes related to epidermal cell destiny  <cit>  , seed development  <cit> , response to drought  <cit>  and cold  <cit> , pathogen-disease resistance  <cit>  stomatal movements  <cit> , phytochrome a-dependent light-sensing responses  <cit>  and sucrose related responses  <cit> , among many other functions.

different myb families have evolved after duplications of their dna binding domains  <cit> . myb dna binding domains are 100– <dig> residues in length, depending on the number of imperfect repeats  in the n-terminal region. from the different classes identified, the r2r <dig> subfamily is the most abundant in plants  <cit> . each repeat adopts a helix-helix-turn-helix structure which interacts with regulatory elements in the promoter, while the c-terminal region is responsible for establishing protein-protein interactions with other components of the eukaryotic transcriptional machinery. based on their well conserved dna-binding domains, r2r <dig> myb genes have been annotated in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous genomes. in arabidopsis thaliana, there are an estimated  <dig> r2r <dig> subfamily members  <cit> , although only some of them have been functionally characterised.

despite myb genes have also been identified in woody species such as poplar, grape and apple, no genome-wide characterization of this family has been conducted in such species. in grapes, the myb genes characterised to date are all involved in the control of flavonoid synthesis   <cit> , myb5b  <cit> , and mybpa <dig>  <cit> ). since quality parameters in grapes and wines such as colour, bitterness and astringency are determined by flavonoid compounds accumulating in fruit tissues, these studies have focussed on anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin synthesis and their regulation via myb factors. in species such as arabidopsis, petunia and maize, it has been determined that myb proteins can act together with bhlh and wdr proteins in a transcriptional complex capable of regulating flavonoid synthesis and other processes concerning epidermal cell identity  <cit> . the affinity of myb proteins for the dna binding sites in each promoter can be influenced by the interaction with these factors.

the annotated genome sequence of vitis vinifera has recently become available  <cit>  after an italian-french effort to obtain a highly homozygous pinot noir  genome  <cit> . in addition, an italian consortium sequenced a highly heterozygous pinot noir genotype   <cit> . these two initiatives provided a genomic platform for studying this fruit crop. to date, its sequence has been assigned to  <dig> chromosomes  <cit>  or linkage groups  <cit> , the same number as in poplar   <cit> . while the pn <dig> genotype is predicted to contain  <dig>  genes in  <dig> mb , the entav <dig> clone is predicted to have  <dig>  genes within  <dig> mb  <cit> . although some supercontigs are still being correctly assembled and oriented in each chromosome, the sequence shows that  <dig> % of the genome is composed of transposable elements mostly located in introns, explaining its high variability and heterozygocity  <cit> . paralogous regions in the grape genome arose by gene duplication and are present in clusters, forcing gene expansion and diversification. the best example of this event is the terpene synthase gene family, with 30– <dig> members in arabidopsis and almost  <dig> members in grape  <cit> . to date, information regarding expansion events of the myb gene superfamily in vitis is absent.

in this work, we describe the putative r2r <dig> myb gene subfamily by means of in silico analysis of the grape genome sequence, in order to predict protein domain architectures, and to assess the extent of conservation and divergence between grape and arabidopsis gene families. candidate genes were chosen for isolation and their expressions were tested in different grape organs to compare expression patterns of closely grouping co-orthologues. this extended analysis is the first to be performed on a dicotyledonous species other than arabidopsis. possible gene retention, loss and expansion processes of myb genes are discussed.

RESULTS
identification and chromosomal distribution of grape r2r <dig> myb genes
the genome sequence of the homozygous pn <dig> genotype of vitis vinifera cv. pinot noir  <cit>  was searched for myb gene models. these are predicted from combining ab initio models together with v. vinifera complementary dna sequences  and alignments of gene/protein models from other species  <cit> . a consensus r2r <dig> myb dna binding domain sequence  was used in a blatsearch, which maintains an index of the entire genome in memory and finds sequences of  <dig> amino acids or more with 80% or higher similarity in the genome. the myb superfamily has been defined as the most abundant transcription factor family in plants  <cit> , with at least  <dig> members in arabidopsis and  <dig> in rice  <cit> . in grapevine, a total of  <dig> myb genes were previously estimated  <cit> , including members of the r1r2r <dig>  r2r <dig>  atypical myb and myb-related gene subfamilies. the arabidopsis and rice r2r <dig> subfamilies are composed of  <dig> and  <dig> members, respectively  <cit> , while in grape  <dig> candidate genes were identified in this study. these were further analysed in terms of their putative protein sequences, exon lengths and their positions and orientations in each chromosome .

this analysis revealed that grape myb genes are distributed in almost all chromosomes, except for chromosome   <dig> . however, thirteen myb gene models have not yet been assigned to a particular chromosome and it is possible that some of them are positioned in chr <dig>  chromosomes with more abundant myb gene models are  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in arabidopsis and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the vitis genome. these were subsequently analysed for gene cluster expansion events.

exon/intron organisation of vitis and arabidopsis myb families
exon structures are highly conserved when the grape and arabidopsis r2r <dig> myb subfamilies are compared . exons  <dig> and  <dig> code for almost the entire r2r <dig> dna binding domain, although this pattern differs in complex multiexonic genes . as shown in figure 2a, exon  <dig> appears to be the most restricted in length, while exons  <dig> and  <dig> are more variable . presence of a fourth and fifth exon is exclusive to some particular genes. despite this variability, the modal lengths of the first two exons are very similar  and highly conserved . these occurrence values are very similar in arabidopsis, suggesting that myb dna binding domains could be partially conserved because exons coding for this domain have restricted lengths during the evolution of plant species. it is interesting to note that the exon lengths observed for the r2r <dig> myb subfamily coincide with the average exon length predicted from models of other grape gene families .

although exon  <dig> is the most diverse in size, myb subfamilies from both species are similarly distributed when the first three exon lengths are considered . exon  <dig> codes for the last region of the r <dig> repeat and for the c-region of the protein. changes both in length and sequence of this exon could have generated functional divergence between myb homologues within and between species, leading to different functional motifs and domains  <cit> .

in order to gain further insights into exon conservation, the split positions of the r2r <dig> repeats within the dna binding domain were classified in the grape and arabidopsis gene models . it is possible to distinguish four groups in arabidopsis, the first three of which are also present in grape . all groups differ in the organisation of exons determining the r2r <dig> domain. in general, the r2r <dig> domain consists of  <dig> amino acids. the n-terminal region before this domain may vary within each group. groups i and ii have their r <dig> repeat split between exons  <dig> and  <dig>  but in group i, the r <dig> repeat is divided between exons  <dig> and  <dig> . in group iii, the first exon codes the complete r <dig> repeat but r <dig> is split between in exons  <dig> and  <dig>  group iv consists only of  <dig> exon coding for the complete myb protein: members of this group have not been identified to date in grapes. atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> are not included in any group of the arabidopsis plot because of their more complex exon/intron organization .

seven arabidopsis myb genes and the grape gene model gsvivt <dig> could not be positioned in these groups. together with myb <dig> and  <dig>  all share a longer n-terminal region before the start of the r <dig> repeat . regarding their exon boundaries, the r <dig> and r <dig> repeats are organised differently and can not be classified by these means. the other arabidopsis mybs and their grape gene homologues are maintained in the same respective groups. despite the occurrence of different duplication and diversification events in these two species, myb exons are highly conserved. length and sequence restrictions in the first two exons could help maintain functionality and achieve sequence specificity of the r2r <dig> domain, while variations in the exons coding for the c-terminal regions could facilitate the gaining of new or cooperative functions when new domains are included.

updated functional clustering of the arabidopsis r2r <dig> myb subfamily
taking the complete arabidopsis r2r <dig> myb subfamily , a phylogenetic tree was constructed to update new functional clades which could also be present in the grape subfamily . most genes sharing similar functions were clustered in the same phylogenetic clades and subclades , suggesting that most closely-related mybs in the same species could recognise similar target genes and possess redundant, overlapping, and/or cooperative functions.

the resulting tree is validated as it shows the same subgroups  observed in phylogenetic trees constructed by kranz et al  <cit>  and yanhui et al  <cit> . new functions have been recently identified, including mybs involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis  <cit>  and hormone induced responses. these new functions are also clustered within this phylogenetic analysis , although a particularly polyphyletic feature within this subfamily is observed: flower development. flower organs were conceived as an adaptive process late in plant evolution. several mechanisms involving cell cycle regulation, secondary metabolite accumulation and hormonal control have been related to reproductive male organ development. myb genes regulating these events have been recently identified . although they cluster in different clades within the myb subfamily and their target genes seem to be different, all ultimately regulate anther development.

the r2r <dig> domain provides both the myb nuclear localisation signals  <cit>  and regulatory specificity  <cit> . c-terminal regions often possess protein-protein interaction or dna-repression motifs. such is the case of the c <dig> motif repressor clade. members of this group possess the c <dig> and c <dig> motifs, known to participate in bhlh interactions  <cit>  and promoter repression, respectively .

among flavonoids, flavonols are known to have functions such as filtering uv radiation and auxin retention and transport . they also have pharmaceutical properties when consumed by animals. recently, their synthesis has been shown to be regulated by three closely related mybs . these mybs are found together in the 'production of flavonol glycosides' clade  and act at different times and tissues throughout plant development  <cit> . this new clade appears to share an ancestral myb gene both with the 'c2-repressor motif' clade and the 'epidermal cell fate' clade . these clades regulate different processes but share up to some extent the control of phenolic compound synthesis.

phylogenetic analysis of the grape r2r <dig> myb subfamily
the same alignment protein weight matrices and phylogeny algorithms used for the construction of the arabidopsis tree were employed for the integrated analysis of the arabidopsis, rice and vitis myb subfamilies . grape protein models with a complete r2r <dig> domain , seven characterised grape proteins and  <dig> arabidopsis homologues were included in the first phylogeny. the remaining grape models generally possessed an incomplete r <dig> repeat, so were not included in this analysis.

sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree analysis using both the single r2r <dig> dna-binding domain and the full predicted protein sequences were produced . outside the dna binding domain, myb proteins had the greatest sequence divergence. although a full sequence alignment could be highly sensitive to the dissimilarities in the c-terminal regions outside the conserved motifs, both trees are extremely similar regarding topology and bootstrap values. possible orthologues between both species appear outside and inside the functional clades previously described for arabidopsis .

in some cases, it was easy to identify two putative orthologues in arabidopsis and vitis, since they were grouped in pairs within a clade. in other situations, grape and arabidopsis homologues were clustered by species within a clade . their functional characterisation will help prove which genes are orthologues within each clade.

none of the grape gene models were grouped within the arabidopsis 'glucosinolate' clade . several lines of evidence suggests that this clade resulted from a β-type duplication  <cit>  which evolved independently in the order brassicales as an adaptive response to herbivory  <cit> , explaining its absence in rice and grape.

for several transcription factor families, linear correlations of abundance have been identified in arabidopsis and vitis  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the myb superfamily consists of  <dig> r1r2r <dig>  r2r <dig>  myb related and atypical myb genes  <cit> , in contrast to the  <dig> estimated myb superfamily members in vitis. in addition, because of the anatomical and physiological differences between grapes and arabidopsis, it can be suggested that some clades could be differentially expanded when comparing arabidopsis and vitis r2r <dig> subfamilies. both inside and outside of some of these functional clades, grape gene expansions were observed as gene pairs or clusters . such is the case of the vitis-specific myb5a and myb5b, the myb <dig> gene pair within the c2-repressor motif clade, myb <dig>  and myb 38/rax <dig> . outside the functional clades, expanded mybs are represented by dichotomous pairs of grape myb <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> homologues, whose functions have yet to be determined. in the case of the 'production of flavonol glycosides' clade, one member  may be absent in grape. this could be a result of the loss of a clade member or a mis-annotation of the vitis genome. it is possible that new r2r <dig> myb genes could be identified in the future as annotations improve. for instance, atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> grape homologues, which belong to the 'guard cell division restriction' clade, have yet to be found, possibly because their complex exon/intron structure  makes them difficult to identify during an annotation procedure.

expansion of grape myb genes affecting wine quality parameters
after the sequencing of the grapevine genome, the expansion of large gene families involved in wine characteristics was observed  <cit> . such was the case of the stilbene synthase family, responsible for the synthesis of the phytoalexin resveratrol, and the terpene synthase family, involved in aroma production. other studies have also revealed that genes belonging to terpene and flavonoid metabolic pathways have suffered selective amplifications in the grape genome, in contrast to other plant genomes  <cit> . if this situation is evident for some biosynthetic genes of the grape phenylpropanoid pathway , it is reasonable to expect that myb genes controlling this pathway could also be expanded. nevertheless, it is also possible to suggest that these genes were maintained in the grapevine genome by means of human domestication, and lost in other plant genomes. for example, many genes were lost in arabidopsis after its two wide genome duplication  events  <cit> .

two different scenarios have been described regarding possible wgd episodes in grape: the first states there is no evidence for such event  <cit> , while in the second, a recent wgd event might have occurred in close proximity to the vitis speciation event  <cit> . in our analysis we observed that myb genes from the 'epidermal cell fate' clade involved in the synthesis of molecules which confer quality to grapes and wines are largely expanded in the vitis genome.

grape and wine colour is defined by glycosylated anthocyanins. any perturbation in their cytoplasmic synthesis, conjugation or vacuole transport thus directly affects berry colour. several myb genes have been characterised in arabidopsis, maize, petunia, antirrhinum, and apple, which regulate some of the processes concerning anthocyanin production. it was discovered that white grapes arose from multiallelic mutations of the vvmyba1/a <dig> genes  <cit> , which controls the last biosynthetic step of anthocyanin synthesis, a glycosylation reaction mediated by the udp-glucose flavonoid 3-o-glucosyltransferase  enzyme  <cit> .

the vitis-arabidopsis phylogenetic tree shows that there are nine anthocyanin-related myb gene models distributed on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> from grape, the most abundant myb-containing chromosomes . an additional gene model  has yet to be linked to a specific chromosome. recently, a grape colour locus was described  <cit> , which we now localised on chromosome  <dig>  in the previous study, four r2r <dig> myb genes were found at this locus, but only two  had a regulatory effect on fruit colour. these proteins differ in the lengths of their c-regions: myba <dig> has a duplicated c-terminal repeat when compared to myba <dig>  while myba <dig> almost completely lacks this region. these differences could cause novel or cooperative functions, and it has been suggested that vvmyba <dig> could control anthocyanin synthesis in grape tissues other than the fruits  <cit> . in addition to the vvmyba1- <dig> genes, three other r2r <dig> myb gene models were detected in the grape colour locus located on chromosome  <dig> .

chromosome  <dig> contains three anthocyanin related mybs, some of them being predicted as possible orthologues of the arabidopsis anthocyanin-related atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> proteins . further experiments are required to determine whether these genes are functional, in order to verify if this new locus influences the colouring of fruits or other plant organs.

in concordance with the arabidopsis chromosomal duplications classified by bowers et al  <cit> , myb gene evolution is though to involve segmental duplications  <cit> . the arabidopsis 'anthocyanin-related' subclade, which includes atmyb <dig>   <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  , was described as a cluster which may have arise by tandem duplications . the anthocyanin and trichome-related subclades within the arabidopsis 'epidermal cell fate' clade may have experienced a major rapid expansion after diverging from monocots but before separating from other dicots  <cit> . supporting this hypothesis is the finding that these two clusters are absent in the rice subfamily . considering the homology and orientation of the nine anthocyanin related mybs found in the two grape loci, it is possible that some of the original mybs could have undergone new multiple tandem duplication events somewhere before or after the separation of the arabidopsis-vitis lineages. however, if this event occurred before lineage separation, this second expansion has clearly been lost during the subsequent evolution of the arabidopsis genome.

seed pigmentation is defined by the accumulation and oxidation of flavan-3-ols, which are transported in the same way as anthocyanins, but are additionally polymerised into proanthocyanidins  and condensed tannins inside vacuoles . in wines, these molecules define astringency and bitterness. atmyb <dig>  controls the final steps of pa synthesis  <cit> . our analysis suggests that grapevine possesses several putative tt <dig> orthologues , many of which are more closely related to tt <dig> than the previously characterised myb5a, myb5b and mybpa <dig>  these genes control pa synthesis and also regulate other biosynthetic genes of the flavonoid pathway  <cit> . chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> possess four, one and two grape tt <dig> homologue genes, respectively. mybpa1/gsvivt <dig> and myb5a/b are shown as dichotomous pairs. taken together, mybs related to pa synthesis also appear expanded. the fact that in lotus japonicus the tt <dig> lineage compromises a three-member subclade  <cit> , addresses the question whether this expansion is exclusive to grape. when including the rice myb subfamily into this analysis, only two models appeared as putative tt <dig> orthologues , indicating that grape has substantially more tt <dig> loci than other species characterised to date.

the observed new expansion events are specific to the anthocyanin related subclade and the tt <dig> related lineage in grapevine, but not to the trichome subclade. both the grapevine adaptive responses  and human breeding and domestication practices could have helped in the selection of grape genotypes with expanded myb genes involved in colour and astringency.

selection of grape gene models for expression analysis and modelling of their dna binding domains
in order to test the annotation procedure and validate gene models, six annotated genes were randomly selected, isolated and their expression patterns were screened in different grapevine organs. vvmyb <dig> , a atmyb <dig> repressor orthologue recently characterised in our group was also included. complete coding regions of vvmyb12-like, 14-like, 24-like, 30-like, 60-like and a c2motif containing repressor-like gene were isolated from different organs of cv. cabernet-sauvignon by rt-pcr . the cdna sequences were 95–100% similar to their respective gene models .

although some arabidopsis mybs have yet to be functionally characterised, global gene expression data throughout plant development is available on the arabidopsis electronic fluorescent pictograph  browser  <cit> . all selected grape myb genes are highly expressed in reproductive organs and revealed organ-expression profiles remarkably similar to their putative arabidopsis orthologues . in addition, vvmyb <dig> and 14-like genes are expressed in a tissue-specific manner in ripped berries/inflorescences and seeds, respectively, in a similar way as in arabidopsis. subsequent experiments are needed to examine the precise function of these putative orthologies.

a comparative modelling approach  using crystallised mammalian c-myb  as the structural template was conducted in order to study dna binding domains from the previously selected mybs. the in silico 3d model of these r2r <dig> domains suggest significant structural homology with rat r1r2r <dig> c-myb . structural studies of the mammalian c-myb factor show that its dna binding domain requires several trypthophan residues which participate in the hydrophobic grouping within the dna-protein interaction interface  <cit> . these residues are maintained in the grape homologues .

some subtle differences between the animal and plant mybs are also present. animal myb domains have a single cysteine residue that needs to be reduced for dna binding and transcriptional activity  <cit> , contrary to most plant r2r <dig> myb domains  which contain two cysteines . under non-reducing conditions, these cysteines form a disulfide bond preventing dna binding  <cit> . the second cysteine residue, conserved in both animals and plants, is essential for regulatory activity in animals. comparatively, the first cysteine, present only in plants, is crucial for myb function, demonstrating structural and functional differences between plants and animals that could influence the dynamics of the protein-dna interaction. the residues surrounding these cysteines are highly similar in the grape myb domains analysed, further suggesting the importance of their conservation.

turns between the α <dig> and α <dig> helices in each repeat  are essential for conferring globular-like structures . grape r2r <dig> myb domains are mostly conserved in the dna-interacting r2α <dig>  r3α <dig> and r3α <dig> helices and turns, as well as in their charge. the most distinct domains in terms of general architecture and positive net charge  were those from vvmyb <dig> and vvmybc <dig> repressor-like proteins, possibly due to their mechanism of action; it has been postulated that myb repressors affect other mybs in their binding by either protein-protein interactions or as dominant negative factors  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the sequencing of the grape genome constituted a powerful tool for gene search and evolution studies. many protein families have been studied in terms of genome conservation across species, in order to establish a genome evolution scenario regarding duplication events and functional diversification. as an example, exon-intron boundaries, expression patterns and regulatory elements in plant d-type cyclin promoters were found to be strongly conserved between arabidopsis and poplar genomes  <cit> . the identification of grape myb genes and their comparative analysis with the arabidopsis genome suggests strong conservation but also expansions of particular functional clades. despite recent events of diversification, the exon/intron organisation of myb genes is highly conserved, suggesting restrictions in r2r <dig> domain variations while allowing c-terminal modifications for gaining new or cooperative functions.

the identification of myb genes in grapevine opens the possibility of modulating myb gene expression in order to control specific aspects of grape physiology and development. in particular, genes involved in flower and seed development or in flavonoid synthesis might be interesting targets for functional characterisation in light of expression similarities in arabidopsis and their possible duplication histories.
