BACKGROUND
the interferon  system is activated in response to viral infection and plays an important role in the host defence system. type i ifns induce proteins with antiviral activity such as double-stranded rna-activated protein kinase , 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetases , rnase l, and the mx protein gtpases  <cit> . our focus here is the oas family of enzymes, which catalyses the synthesis of oligoadenylates of the general structure pppna, commonly abbreviated 2-5a. rnase l, a latent endoribonuclease, becomes activated upon binding of 2-5as, and when activated it catalyses the degradation of both viral and cellular rnas, including ribosomal rna  <cit> . this antiviral response results in inhibition of protein synthesis and in some cases it causes apoptosis. three genes encoding enzymatic active oas enzymes have been identified in human cells by immunoblotting analyses and characterization of cdna and genomic clones, and they are designated oas <dig>  oas <dig>  and oas <dig>  <cit> . the human oas <dig> gene encodes at least six isoforms with different theoretical molecular weights, p <dig>  p44a, p44b, p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> . the oas <dig> isoforms are splice variants and contain the same five core exons but differ in their 3′ exons. the oas <dig> isoforms p <dig> and p <dig>  the oas <dig> isoforms p <dig> and p <dig> deriving from alternative splicing of the oas <dig> gene, and the oas <dig> isoform p <dig> have been detected at the protein level in human cells  <cit> , whereas the p <dig>  p <dig>  p44a and p44b oas <dig> isoforms have only been detected at the mrna level in cells treated with ifn  <cit> .

it has previously been demonstrated that the cellular localization of the oas proteins differs. it has been shown by electron microscopy that the human oas <dig> p <dig> isoform is localized to the membranes of the nuclear envelope and rough endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . the oas <dig> p <dig> isoform is localized to the cytoplasm  <cit> , whereas the oas <dig> p <dig> isoform was found mainly in the cytoplasmic fraction and the p <dig> isoform mainly in the microsomal fraction of cells  <cit> .

the expression of the oas <dig> isoforms are cell-type specific  <cit> , and the differential expression patterns of some of the oas <dig> isoforms can be related to a single-nucleotide polymorphism  rs <dig> situated in the splice acceptor site at the 5′ end of exon  <dig> in the oas <dig> gene   <cit> . the two alleles have been named a and g, since one has a splice acceptor site in exon  <dig> with an aag sequence, and the other has a splice acceptor site with an agg sequence. the agg splice acceptor site  results in mrnas encoding p <dig>  and the aag splice acceptor site results in an mrna encoding p <dig>  since the splice site between exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> has shifted one nucleotide downstream. the expression of p <dig> results from splicing  <dig> nucleotides downstream from the exon  <dig> start site, and the expression of p <dig> derives from mrna linking exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> without splicing.

the rs <dig> snp has been associated with two autoimmune diseases, type  <dig> diabetes and mutiple sclerosis. in type  <dig> diabetes, it was found that affected persons were predominantly homozygous for the g allele  <cit> , and this association was confirmed by others  <cit> . these authors further concluded that the rs <dig> snp was associated with rs <dig>  as a haplotype in type  <dig> diabetics. the rs <dig> snp  is an a or g positioned in exon  <dig> resulting in an oas <dig> protein with either ser <dig> or gly <dig> in the core domain. the association between these two snps and type  <dig> diabetes has not been confirmed in a larger study, though others have concluded that there may be a very weak association between the rs <dig>  and rs <dig> snps and type  <dig> diabetes in a population of european descents, however these authors stated that this association might also be linked to other snps in the oas <dig> locus  <cit> . in multiple sclerosis the same haplotype was studied in a spanish study group  <cit> . they found that the g allele of rs <dig> and the a allele of rs <dig>  seemed to increase the risk of having multiple sclerosis, which is the same risk haplotype seen for type  <dig> diabetes. in an irish study, only considering the rs <dig> snp, the opposite was found, in that the g allele showed to be protective of multiple sclerosis whereas the a allele conferred susceptibility  <cit> . the aa genotype was associated with disease activity despite ifnβ therapy and earlier breakthrough of multiple sclerosis upon ifnβ therapy, whereas the gg genotype was associated with delayed breakthrough relapses upon ifnβ therapy. finally, in an italian study no association was found between rs <dig> and multiple sclerosis  <cit> . thus the association with the two oas <dig> snps, rs <dig> and rs <dig> , and type  <dig> diabetes or multiple sclerosis remain elusive.

an association was found with the oas <dig> snp rs <dig> and the response to measles vaccination in an african-american population  <cit> . the a allele was associated with higher levels of measles neutralizing antibodies in a dose dependent manner with regard to the genotype aa > ag > gg. during rubella vaccinations, the a allele was associated with lower rubella virus specific il- <dig> secretion and the g allele with higher il- <dig> secretion  <cit> . it seems as if oas <dig> gene polymorphism might also be involved in the mechanism underlying the heterogeneous immune response to rubella and measles vaccinations.

during west nile virus  infections, the aa genotype of rs <dig> resulted in higher virus titers than ag or gg genotypes when tested in an ex vivo model of wnv replication in cultured human lymphoid tissue  <cit> . it was concluded that the rs <dig> is a host genetic risk factor for initial wnv infection in humans. however, this specific association could not be seen in a more recent case-control study, although an association was seen between the snp rs <dig> positioned in the intron between exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> in the oas <dig> gene and an increased risk for wnv encephalitis and paralysis  <cit> . in hepatitis c virus  patients it was found that patients with aa in rs <dig> were non-responders to interferon treatment and they had a progressive hcv disease  <cit> . when overexpressing the individual oas proteins in human hepatoma huh <dig> cells, oas <dig> p <dig> as well as oas <dig> p <dig> could inhibit hcv replication, whereas the oas <dig> isoforms p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> and the oas <dig> isoforms p <dig> and p <dig> could not  <cit> . this suggests that expression of p <dig> caused by the g allele of the rs <dig> snp is protective of hcv infection, or the a allele could be a risk factor. overexpression of individual oas proteins in a <dig> cells infected with dengue virus resulted in antiviral effects of the oas <dig> p <dig> and p <dig> and the oas <dig> p <dig>  <cit> . the other oas proteins, oas <dig> p44b, p <dig> and p <dig> as well as the oas <dig> p <dig> and p <dig> did not lead to antiviral effects. this suggests that the a allele of the rs <dig> snp could be a risk factor for dengue infection. in conclusion, infection of the flaviviruses wnv, dengue virus and hcv seem to be inhibited by expression of the p <dig> oas <dig> protein derived from the presence of the g allele of the rs <dig> snp in the oas <dig> gene.

total oas enzyme activity analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes from  <dig> individuals revealed that persons with the a allele in rs <dig> had a lower total oas enzymatic activity compared with persons with the g allele  <cit> . the oas activity decreased in a dose dependent manner, the genotype gg > ga > aa. this could be due to differences in activity of the oas <dig> isoforms p <dig> encoded by the a allele, p <dig> encoded by the g allele, or differential levels of p <dig> encoded by either allele. no evidence has yet been presented to support this, as the levels of p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> oas <dig> proteins in these cells were not analysed. the difference in total oas activity in the leukocytes observed could also be a result of other snps in the oas locus, which could be linked as haplotypes to the a and g alleles of the snp rs <dig> 

in order to clarify some of the consequences of two of the important snps ) in the oas <dig> gene, we have determined the mrna expression profiles of the oas <dig>  oas <dig> and oas <dig> genes in three different cell lines with different oas <dig> genotypes at the rs <dig> position. furthermore, we have analysed the oas protein expression patterns of these three cell lines and determined the total oas enzyme activity after interferon treatment. we have determined the functional effects of rs <dig> , which results in two isoforms of the oas <dig> proteins by analysing two mutants of an oas <dig> core protein, one containing a serine and the other a glycine at position  <dig> in the primary structure. finally, we present evidence of the specific cellular localization of the oas <dig> isoform p <dig> to the mitochondria, which differs from p <dig> 

RESULTS
in order to address potential influences of the rs <dig> polymorphism  on the oas <dig> gene expression and enzyme activities relating to the a and g alleles, we set out to identify the oas mrna expression profiles and the oas enzyme activities in three human cell lines, distinguished by their oas <dig> gg, ga and aa genotypes. through dna sequencing of genomic dna retrieved from the three cell lines we found that hela cells are homozygous for the a allele , ht <dig> cells are heterozygous  and daudi cells are homozygous for the g allele  with respect to the rs <dig> polymorphism.

mrna expression profiles of the oas splice variants
in order to create a full expression profile of the oas <dig> splice variants p <dig>  p44a, p44b, p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  we carried out qrt-pcr analyses to measure the mrna levels of the different isoforms. primers were created with a forward primer annealing within the exon 1- <dig> core region whereas a downstream reverse primer was designed to specifically amplify each splice variant . the p <dig> and p <dig> mrnas could not be distinguished in this qrt-pcr due to only a single nucleotide difference, and several attempts to produce a usable reverse primer failed. we therefore made the assumption that hela cells do not express p <dig> and daudi cells not p <dig>  as a consequence of the aa/gg genotypes of these cell lines with respect to the rs <dig> polymorphism. hela, ht <dig> and daudi cells were treated with ifn-β, or left un-treated as controls for 24 hours. total rna was isolated and qrt-pcr analyses were performed using gapdh for normalization, which did not change during the experimental set-up. the main oas <dig> mrna product found in hela cells treated with ifn was the unspliced p <dig> isoform, with a smaller amount of spliced p <dig> mrna and only trace amounts of p <dig> mrna detected . in the heterozygous cell line ht <dig> treated with ifn, there was predominantly the spliced p46/ <dig> mrnas and less of the p <dig> mrna. the main oas <dig> mrna in daudi cells was the spliced p <dig>  and this mrna was present in control cells at a considerable amount, and the level increased after interferon treatment. of the other oas <dig> isoforms only very lowinducible amounts of p44a and p <dig> mrnas could be detected in the three cell lines and we were unable to detect p44b mrna in any of the cell lines. all qrt-pcr dissociation curves indicated single pcr products. this was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis of all the qrt-pcr samples, revealing the amplification of the expected band size for each oas <dig> mrna .we then determined mrna expression profiles of the oas <dig>  and oas <dig> mrnas  in the three cell lines . the oas <dig> p <dig> and p <dig> mrnas were found to increase after interferon treatment in the three cell lines, whereas the oas <dig> p <dig> mrna was induced in hela and ht <dig> cells and was barely detectable in daudi cells. daudi and ht <dig> cells primarily expressed the oas <dig> p <dig> mrna, whereas hela cells expressed both the p <dig> and p <dig> mrnas. daudi cells also expressed p <dig> mrna in untreated cells.

protein expression profiles of the oas isoforms and total oas enzyme activity
we then carried out immunoblotting analysis of protein extracts from the three cell lines using different anti-oas antibodies in order to compare the protein levels . initially, the oas <dig> isoforms were analysed by an anti-oas <dig> antibody targeting all oas <dig> variants, and the ability of the anti-oas <dig> antibody to recognize all the oas <dig> isoforms was verified by expression of the individual oas <dig> isoforms in hela cells after transient transfection . in the cell lines hela, ht <dig> and daudi, only the oas <dig> isoforms p <dig> and p <dig> could be detected . an ifn-α and ifn-β inducible expression of p <dig> was seen in hela cells, whereas daudi cells had an ifn-α and ifn-β inducible expression of p <dig>  daudi cells expressed the p <dig> protein constitutively, whereas p <dig> could only be detected after ifn-α and ifn-β treatment of the hela cells. in the heterozygous ht <dig> cells, the relative levels of expressed protein, i.e. p <dig> or p <dig> following ifn-α and ifn-β treatment were in favour of the p <dig> isoform with the level of p <dig> being very low. no other oas <dig> isoforms were detected in the immunoblotting analysis, most likely due to low levels of protein expression, and the protein expression pattern was found to correlate with the qrt-pcr analyses. we would have expected an expression of p <dig> in ht <dig> and hela cells due to the presence of the a allele of the rs <dig> in these cell lines, however the p <dig> isoform mrna unspliced between exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> prevailed in hela cells, and the allele expressing the spliced p <dig> isoform prevailed in the ht <dig> cells.although a recombinantly expressed oas <dig> p <dig> isoform could be detected in transfected hela cells, none of the oas <dig> isoforms were detected in the cell lines, even though their mrnas were present in high amounts . we tried several commercially available oas <dig> antibodies, however none of these detected endogenous expression of the oas <dig> proteins. when using an oas specific peptide antibody recognizing all oas isoforms, we observed that the oas <dig> proteins were indeed expressed in these cell lines in accordance with the oas <dig> mrna levels . and finally, the oas <dig> isoform p <dig> was expressed in ifn-α and ifn-β treated hela and ht <dig> cells, but not in daudi cells, also in accordance with the mrna levels. none of the oas isoforms were induced by ifn-γ in any of the three cell lines.

total oas enzyme activity assays were carried out on crude cell extracts from the three cell lines, untreated and treated with ifnβ . we found that hela and ht <dig> cells had equal inducible oas enzyme activities. this oas activity originated from the oas <dig> isoforms p <dig> in hela and mainly p <dig> in ht <dig>  together with the oas <dig> isoforms p <dig> and p <dig>  and the oas <dig> isoform p <dig>  daudi cells had a high constitutive oas activity, which could be increased by ifnβ treatment. the oas enzyme activity in daudi cells originated from the oas <dig> p <dig> isoform and the oas <dig> p <dig> and p <dig> isoforms. the constitutive expression of oas <dig> and oas <dig> in the daudi cell line could be due to it originating from a b lymphoblast, since b-cell lymphocytes are known to constitutively express various cytokines  <cit> .

enzyme activities of oas <dig> mutants associated with the rs <dig>  polymorphism
we next wanted to analyse if the snp rs <dig>   influences the oas <dig> enzymatic activity considering its position in the oas <dig> core unit. thus we measured the specific oas enzyme activities of two truncated oas <dig> proteins i.e. p39g/p39s distinguished by only a single amino acid mutation  at position  <dig> giving rise to proteins of ~39 kda . the specific activities of the p39g and p39s variants were found not to differ . we therefore concluded that the specific activity of the oas <dig> isoforms with gly <dig> or ser <dig> deriving from the rs <dig>  snp have indistinguishable specific enzyme activities.

cellular localization of the oas <dig> p <dig> and p <dig> isoforms
previous analyses of the localization of the oas <dig> isoforms have been conducted using either highly expressed recombinant proteins or using antibodies recognizing all oas isoforms. using hela and daudi cells expressing mainly p <dig> or p <dig> combined with the very specific oas <dig> antibody, we were able to distinguish the cellular localization of these two oas <dig> isoforms.hela and daudi cells were stimulated with ifn-β for 24 hours and fixed cells were then subjected to immunofluorescence cytochemistry and electron microscopy using the anti-oas <dig> antibody . the fixed cell pellets were cryosectioned, and this allow for analyses of endogenous proteins without prior permeabilisation and a good resolution of the immunofluoresence cytochemistry. as a mitochondrial tracker in these immunofluoresence analyses, we used an antibody against the mitochondrial protein vdac <dig>  the results obtained from daudi cells showed that the oas <dig> p <dig> isoform, which is the main oas <dig> isoform present in these cells together with very low amounts of p <dig> detected on the mrna level , co-localized with the mitochondrial protein , and this was clearly seen in the merged picture . the localisation of p <dig> to the mitochondria was also supported by electron microscopy , showing concentrated staining of p <dig> in the mitochondria. the cellular localization of the oas <dig> isoforms in hela cells is different. the oas <dig> isoforms distributed throughout the cytoplasm , which does not perfectly co-localize with the vdac <dig> mitochondrial protein , seen in the merged picture as yellow stain. this finding is supported by the electron microscopy, showing that the hela oas <dig> isoforms associated with organelle structures resembling vacuoles/lysosomes in the cytoplasm as well as with the mitochondria . the main oas <dig> isoform present in hela cells was p <dig> together with low amounts of p <dig> detected on the mrna level.

in order to establish if the mitochondrial localization of p <dig> was cell type specific for daudi cells, we overexpressed oas <dig> p <dig> and p <dig> in hela cells after transient transfections . also in hela cells, p <dig> is localised to the mitochondria seen as a co-localization with the mitotracker. overexpressed p <dig> distributed evenly in the hela cells, as we have seen previously with overexpressed his-tagged oas <dig> p <dig> protein  <cit> . since the transfected hela cells were not treated with interferon, no endogenous oas <dig> proteins could be detected in the un-transfected cells.

we therefore concluded that the oas <dig> p <dig> isoform localized in the mitochondria, whereas the oas <dig> p <dig> isoform mainly localized in vacuoles/lysosomes within the cytoplasm as well as in the mitochondria.

discussion
several theories have been proposed regarding the association of snps in the oas <dig> gene with different diseases, but no direct correlation between the snps and the expression pattern and specific enzymatic activities has been shown up till now. the oas <dig> mrnas can be differentially spliced according to a polymorphism at the splice acceptor site of exon  <dig> , and it has been observed that lymphocytes from individuals with the g allele have a higher total oas enzymatic activity than individuals with the a allele  <cit> .

bonnevie-nielsen et al.  <cit>  showed in leukocytes that the a and g alleles of the rs <dig> snp could be associated with the presence of either the p <dig> and p <dig> or the p <dig> oas <dig> mrnas, respectively. however, the individual levels of oas <dig> proteins were not investigated, and the level of p <dig> mrna unspliced between exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> was not analysed either. we have now demonstrated that the a allele present in hela cells primarily leads to expression of the unspliced p <dig> mrna and only secondary to the spliced p <dig> mrna, whereas the g allele present in daudi cells leads to expression of the spliced p <dig> mrna and to a lower extent of p <dig> mrna. only the p <dig> and p <dig> isoforms could be detected by immunoblotting analyses, whereas p44a, p <dig> and p <dig> mrnas were only detected by qrt-pcr. the finding of p <dig> and p <dig> as the main oas <dig> proteins expressed is also supported by earlier immunoblotting analyses  <cit> .

very recently, the rs <dig> polymorphism was analysed in human bronchial epithelial cells  <cit> . in bronchial cells with the gg genotype only the p <dig> isoform was detected, whereas in the cells with the aa genotype the expression of the unspliced p <dig> isoform prevailed the expression of the spliced isoforms p44a, p <dig>  and p <dig>  as the latter three were only detected at the mrna level. also in ht <dig> cells, previous results showed that the endogenous level of the oas <dig> p <dig> isoform was very low  <cit> . accordingly, the a allele most likely prompts primarily to the production of the unspliced p <dig> isoform, and the g allele the production of the spliced p <dig> isoform. however, it can not be excluded that p <dig> and p <dig> might be expressed at higher levels in leukocytes harbouring the a allele together with p <dig>  since splicing is cell type-specific.

although debated, it has been suggested that the snps rs <dig> and rs <dig>  may be linked as a haplotype  <cit> . we have analysed the functional effect of the rs <dig>  snp, and found that the p39g truncated oas <dig> variant exhibited the same specific oas enzyme activity as the p39s variant. consequently, the increased oas enzyme activities in leukocytes with the g allele is unlikely to be caused by a higher specific enzyme activity of gly <dig> containing oas <dig> variants compared with the ser <dig> containing oas <dig> variants. the contribution of the the oas <dig> and oas <dig> proteins to the total oas activity in the three cell lines investigated here is not clear, and further experiments are required to address this issue.

importantly, however, we have shown that the oas <dig> isoforms in hela and daudi cells harbour a differential cellular localization. the main oas <dig> isoform p <dig> expressed in daudi cells was found to be localized in the mitochondria and no oas <dig> was found in the cytoplasm. in hela cells, the main oas <dig> isoform p <dig> was localized in cytosolic compartments resembling vacuoles/lysosomes as well as in the mitochondria. when the oas <dig> p <dig> isoform was overexpressed in hela cells, it also localized in the mitochondria ruling out the possibility of a cell type specific localization of p <dig> in daudi cells. this supports earlier findings that p <dig> and p <dig> are in the cytoplasmic as well as in microsomal fractions, p <dig> mostly in the cytoplasm and p <dig> mainly in association with the microsomal fraction  <cit> , which probably contained the mitochondria.

the expression of the oas <dig> isoform p <dig> encoded by the presence of the g allele leads to:  high oas enzyme activity in leukocytes from type  <dig> diabetics,  low response to measles vaccination and higher virus-specific il- <dig> secretion during rubella vaccination, and  inhibition of wnv, hcv and dengue virus replication. additionally it has been documented that the g allele hence p <dig> seems to predominate in skin fibroblasts derived from alzheimer disease patients  <cit> . the difference in cellular localization between the p <dig> and p <dig> isoforms identified here could potentially explain part of these associations. the presence of p <dig> in the mitochondria may lead to longer half-life of the protein, and thus sustained oas activity in the cells. the shift in oas enzyme activities towards mitochondria may improve conditions for apoptosis, since mitochondria is a key player in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway  <cit> . both of these hypotheses are speculative at the moment.

although our goal was to unravel the putative functionality of the rs <dig> and rs <dig>  oas <dig> snps, the identification of the p <dig> oas <dig> isoform in mitochondria adds to the understanding of the 2-5a system. we have previously found a conserved caax motif in a number of oas <dig> isoforms  <cit> , which are conserved in several species  <cit> . the caax motif is known to be important for geranylation or farnesylation of protein targets, and is believed to functionally direct these to cellular membranes. we therefore suggest that the localization of the different oas <dig> isoforms could differ depending on the presence of this caax motif in the c-terminus. in humans, only the p <dig> isoform holds this c-terminal caax motif, while the other oas <dig> isoforms including p <dig> do not. further experiments are required to investigate this hypothesis.

we have previously shown that the 2′-phosphodiesterase pde <dig>  a nuclease degrading 2-5as is also localized to the mitochondria or more specifically to the mitochondrial matrix  <cit> . this mitochondrial localization was found puzzling with regard to the 2-5a system, since no oas enzymes at that time had been found in mitochondria. accordingly, if most 2-5as were produced and active in the cytoplasmic compartment, the mitochondrial inner membrane would logically pose a hydrophobic barrier hindering the pde <dig> from accessing its 2-5a substrates. previously, an activated rnase l was also found in the mitochondria although a broad cellular distribution was observed for this enzyme  <cit> . it is therefore now possible to put forward a model with a complete 2-5a system in the mitochondria . since the pde <dig> share similarities with other rna deadenylases and was found to degrade 3′-5′ rna linkages also, it was suggested that it had a role in mitochondrial rna turnover. our results and results from others indicated that the pde <dig> was indeed regulating mitochondrial mrnas  <cit> . in addition, it has also been suggested that mitochondrial rnase l might influence mitochondrial mrna turnover and induce apoptosis, when cells are stimulated by ifnα  <cit> . if this is the case, the p <dig> isoform might contribute to the regulation of mitochondrial rna turnover as an activator of rnase l. hence, the p <dig> isoform might be involved in the pro-apoptotic stimulation of rnase l in mitochondria.

CONCLUSIONS
we have found that the snp rs <dig> in the oas <dig> gene mainly leads to expression of either the p <dig> isoform or the p <dig> isoform. in the snp associated with diabetes, the expression of the oas <dig> isoform p <dig> prevails, and we have seen that this isoform is localized to the mitochondria. our data support a model that in certain conditions the mitochondria can harbour a full 2-5a system, which might contribute to interferon stimulated apoptosis.
