BACKGROUND
spermatozoa are specialized cells that are highly compartmentalized, transcriptionally inactive and unable to synthesize new proteins. protein phosphorylation is a post-translational mechanism that plays a crucial role in sperm physiology, controlling motility, capacitation, hyperactivated motility and the acrosome reaction  <cit> . low sperm motility is one of the main causes of male infertility  <cit> . the biochemical mechanisms essential for the development of motility are still far from understood, however, serine/threonine protein phosphatase  <dig>  and glycogen synthase kinase  <dig> , have been recognized as components of the regulatory mechanism  <cit> . three separate genes  encode the catalytic subunit of ppp <dig> . ppp1cc undergoes alternative splicing, giving rise to a ubiquitous isoform ppp1cc <dig> and a testis-enriched and sperm specific-isoform, ppp1cc <dig>  <cit> . ppp1cc <dig> is the only ppp <dig> isoform highly enriched in bovine, rhesus monkey and human sperm  <cit> . the phosphatase is distributed along the entire flagellum, including the mid-piece, consistent with a role in sperm motility, and also in the posterior and equatorial regions of the head, suggesting a role in the acrosome reaction  <cit> . the observation that ppp1c had a two-fold higher activity in immotile bovine caput epididymal sperm compared to mature motile caudal sperm is consistent with it being directly involved in sperm motility  <cit> . moreover, inhibition of ppp1cc <dig> activity by the toxins okadaic acid or calyculin a induced and stimulated motility in caput and caudal sperm, respectively  <cit> . homozygous knockout mice for ppp1cc gene  lead to sterility of male but not female mice. the sterility resulted from a combination of gross structural defects in spermatids that cause apoptosis and lack of spermiation  <cit> . the evolutionary conservation and the importance of ser/thr phosphatases in regulating flagellar motility, is highlighted by the involvement of a ppp <dig> homolog in the regulation of rooster sperm motility  <cit>  and by the involvement of a ser/thr phosphatase in the regulation of microtubule sliding velocity in paramecium and chlamydomonas <cit> .

regulation of ppp <dig> catalytic activity is mediated via binding to specific regulatory subunits, the ppp <dig> interacting proteins  <cit> . the extensive diversity of such interacting proteins and their tissue specificity makes them potential pharmacological targets  <cit> . to date, studies have shown that sperm do not appear to contain ppp1r <dig> , whose activity is controlled by protein kinase a phosphorylation  <cit> . however, a ppp1r2-like activity seems to be present in sperm due to its sensitivity to gsk <dig> phosphorylation  <cit> . ppp <dig> and ppp1r <dig> are known to form a stable, catalytically inactive heterodimer, also known as mgatp-dependent phosphatase  <cit> . ppp1r <dig> can also bind and regulate ppp1c already complexed to other regulatory subunits  <cit> . phosphorylation of ppp1r <dig> at thr <dig> by gsk <dig> releases the inhibition and the phosphatase becomes active  <cit> . immotile caput sperm contained six-fold higher gsk <dig> activity than motile caudal sperm  <cit> . the presence and activity of gsk <dig> in sperm has been further characterized, emphasizing its role in sperm motility regulation  <cit> .

recent experiments have demonstrated that sperm also contains the homologue of the yeast ppp <dig> binding protein, ppp1r <dig>  and that the complex with ppp1cc <dig> is catalytically inactive  <cit> . finally, a potent heat-stable inhibitor was identified as the orthologue of the mouse t complex testis-expressed gene tctex <dig>  also known as ppp1r <dig>   <cit> . the heat stability of these inhibitors is important for facilitating the purification, although no other function was found so far for this property. it was also shown that both inhibitors, ppp1r <dig> and ppp1r <dig>  form a catalytically inactive multi-complex with ppp1cc <dig> in sperm  <cit> .

despite these findings whether sperm contain ppp1r <dig> remains undetermined. the purpose of this study was to determine if ppp1r <dig> was present in spermatozoa. we show here, for the first time, the presence and localization of ppp1r <dig> in human spermatozoa. furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of ppp1r2p <dig>  a new isoform of ppp1r <dig>  the gene corresponding to ppp1r2p <dig> was previously designated as an intron-less pseudogene  <cit> . our studies raise the intriguing possibility that the interplay between ppp1cc2/ppp1r <dig> and ppp1cc2/ppp1r2p <dig> could operate to regulate human sperm function.

RESULTS
identification of ppp1r2p <dig> - a novel ppp1r <dig> isoform in testis
the catalytic subunit isoforms ppp1cc <dig> and ppp1cc <dig> were used as baits to screen a human testis cdna library by yeast two-hybrid  <cit> . from the ppp1cc <dig> screening,  <dig> positive clones were recovered, one of which encoded the complete sequence of a novel isoform of the regulatory protein known as ppp1r <dig> or inhibitor  <dig> . this novel clone is located on chromosome  <dig>  aligns to the sequence id:nr <dig> and is classified as ppp1r <dig> pseudogene  <dig> . while ppp1r <dig> is present on chromosome  <dig> and is encoded by  <dig> exons, ppp1r2p <dig> is an intronless gene and therefore was designated as a probable pseudogene by both ncbi and ensembl databases. this clone has been deposited in the genbank database under the id:jf <dig>   <cit> . the ppp1r2p <dig> mrna is also present in human testis cdna library repository of the mammalian gene collection  program   <cit> . by searching unigene  for ppp1r2p <dig> specific expressed sequence tags   <dig> ests were obtained, of which  <dig> are from testis. these ests are specific for this pseudogene and cover close to 65% of the ppp1r2p <dig> nucleotide sequence including the cds. taken together, our results, the ests, and the mgc results  <cit> , support the proposal that ppp1r2p <dig> is not a pseudogene and is indeed expressed in testis. furthermore, by blast search we only found orthologs of this pseudogene in primateâ€™s assembly genomes.

ppp1r2p <dig> has only  <dig> nucleotide substitutions  relative to ppp1r <dig>  which correspond to  <dig> amino acid changes  in the translated sequence. comparing the ppp1r2p <dig> protein sequence with that of the ppp1r <dig> using clustalw <dig>  we found that all the ppp1c binding regions are maintained . however, there are important differences between ppp1r <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig>  in that the phosphorylation sites of the latter, for gsk <dig>  and ck <dig> kinase , appear as pro and arg, respectively .

ppp1r2p <dig> interacts and inhibits ppp1c
to validate the yeast two-hybrid result we re-confirmed the ppp1r2p <dig> interaction with different ppp1c isoforms. the sequential yeast co-transformation, showed the interaction of ppp1r2p <dig> with ppp1ca, ppp1cc <dig> and ppp1cc <dig> and with the unique c-terminal of ppp1cc <dig>  . the apparent relative lack of specificity toward the ppp1c isoforms may arise given that in yeast co-transformation the interaction is forced and happens inside the nucleus. in vivo, the ppp1c isoforms have different tissue/cellular and subcellular localizations that would influence the ppp1r2p <dig> interaction. in order to compare the binding of ppp1r <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig> to ppp1cc isoforms, and demonstrate the interaction as direct, a blot overlay was performed . a blot containing the same amount of commercial ppp1r <dig> or his-ppp1r2p <dig> was incubated with ppp1cc <dig> or ppp1cc <dig> and the interaction detected using the cbc3c and the cbc <dig> antibodies, respectively . the binding of ppp1r2p <dig> to both ppp1cc isoforms was confirmed and the binding was similar to that of ppp1r <dig> 

since ppp1r <dig> is a potent heat-stable inhibitor of ppp <dig> in the nanomolar range  <cit> , we decided to determine whether ppp1r2p <dig> is heat-stable, if it exhibited ppp <dig> inhibitory activity, and if so, what was the potency compared to that of ppp1r <dig>  we determined the ic <dig> values of recombinant his-ppp1r2p <dig> for the ppp1cc isoforms using the standard phosphorylase phosphatase assay  <cit> . results showed that ppp1r2p <dig> is a potent heat-stable inhibitor of ppp1c with a dose-response curve similar to the commercial ppp1r <dig>  and ic <dig> values in the subnanomolar range .

gsk <dig> does not phosphorylate ppp1r2p <dig> in vitro
phosphorylation of ppp1r <dig> at thr <dig>  by gsk <dig>  relieves the inhibition of ppp1c and the complex ppp1c/ppp1r <dig> becomes active  <cit> . also, phosphorylation by ck <dig> at the serines  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> enhances thr <dig> phosphorylation  <cit> . the absence of the gsk <dig> phosphorylation site, thr <dig>  and of the ck <dig> phosphorylation site, ser <dig>  in ppp1r2p <dig> led us to test the phosphorylation of ppp1r2p <dig> by these kinases. ppp1r <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig> were incubated in parallel reactions with gsk <dig>  or ck <dig>  or both, in the presence of 32p-atp. ppp1r <dig> is known to be a poor substrate for gsk <dig> alone in vitro, but synergistic phosphorylation can be observed if phosphorylated by ck <dig> plus gsk <dig>  <cit> . in our hands this occurred with recombinant ppp1r <dig> . however, under the same conditions, no ppp1r2p <dig> phosphorylation by gsk <dig> was detected and the phosphorylation in the presence of both kinases was the same as with ck <dig> alone . the results indicate that there is no site for gsk <dig> phosphorylation in ppp1r2p <dig> and that ck <dig> is still able to phosphorylate but in other residue rather than ser <dig> 

ppp1r <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig> are present in human ejaculated sperm
based on previous biochemical studies it was suggested that sperm ppp1cc <dig> is regulated by a ppp1r2-like activity  <cit> . however, there was no definitive evidence for the presence of ppp1r <dig> in spermatozoa. efforts to identify ppp1r <dig> at the protein level in testis and sperm have proven to be difficult because of the low amount of protein in soluble extracts and the quality of the available antibodies. ppp1r <dig> is an intrinsically unstructured protein  with a high proportion of charged and hydrophilic residues versus few hydrophobic residues  <cit> . proteins such as ppp1r <dig> , will migrate in sds-page at a position corresponding to a higher molecular mass than predicted by the primary sequence   <cit> . ppp1r2p <dig> has the same predicted molecular mass of ppp1r <dig> and in sds-page migrated at the same position of 32Â kda . to deal with the low abundance and taking advantage of the fact that ppp1r <dig> is heat-stable, protein precipitation was used to concentrate the samples from heat-treated extracts  <cit> . so far only one report showed successful identification of ppp1r <dig> in heat-stable extracts of bull testis and mouse testis and sperm using a ppp1r <dig> antibody  raised in rabbit against an affinity-purified peptide   <cit> .

we used a sheep polyclonal anti-ppp1r <dig> antibody, raised against purified rabbit ppp1r <dig> as immunogen to detect ppp1r2/ppp1r2p <dig> as a band around the expected size  in testis and sperm extracts   <cit> . to demonstrate the presence of ppp1cc in the same extracts, an antibody against the c-terminus of ppp1cc was used . we detected two bands in testis that correspond to ppp1cc <dig> and ppp1cc <dig>  while only one band, ppp1cc <dig>  was detected in sperm, as expected  <cit> . moreover, since ppp1r <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig> are heat-stable inhibitors, we heated ripa extracts by boiling. western blotting revealed a band corresponding to ppp1r2/ppp1r2p <dig> at the expected size of 32Â kda . to unequivocally demonstrate the existence of ppp1r <dig> and the new ppp1r2p <dig> isoform in human sperm we performed an immunoprecipitation of ppp1r2/ppp1r2p <dig> from five independent human ejaculated sperm samples  followed by mass spectrometry analysis. immunoprecipitation was performed using heat-stable extracts of human ejaculates. we immunoprecipitated sufficient amounts of ppp1r2/ppp1r2p <dig> for detection of their peptides by mass spectrometry . using the orbitrap velos mass spectrometer we identified  <dig> unique ms/ms spectra corresponding to  <dig> different peptides of ppp1r2/ppp1r2p <dig>  from these,  <dig> ms/ms spectra correspond to  <dig> peptides that match uniquely with ppp1r <dig>   <dig> ms/ms spectra correspond to a peptide that matches uniquely to ppp1r2p <dig> and the remaining correspond to common sequences . the overall sequence coverage was 64% for ppp1r <dig> and 57% for ppp1r2p <dig>  the mascot scores for each protein were near  <dig> . this is the first report of ppp1r <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig> recovery from multiple extracts of human sperm, using two different antibodies.

mass spectrometry data of the same immunoprecipitates showed that ppp1cc <dig> was also present. five peptides out of  <dig> ms/ms spectra were identified, that matched ppp1cc <dig> with 15% coverage and a protein mascot score higher than  <dig> . the results show that ppp1cc <dig> binds to ppp1r2/ppp1r2p <dig> in human spermatozoa .

in extracts from ejaculated sperm, three independent peptides show post-translational modifications, identified as phosphorylation at ser <dig>  ser <dig> and ser <dig>  however, they could not be assigned to either ppp1r <dig> or ppp1r2p <dig>  given that both proteins are identical in that region. to our knowledge, this is the first time that phosphorylation of ser <dig> has been reported for ppp1r2/ppp1r2p <dig>  tyrosine or threonine phosphorylations were not detected. the peptides obtained with phosphorylations correspond to only 7% of the total number of obtained peptides, strongly supporting the fact that ppp1r2/ppp1r2p <dig> are predominantly not phosphorylated.

ppp1r <dig> subcellular-localization in human spermatozoa
immunocytochemistry was used to study the subcellular localization of ppp1r <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig> and their co-localization with ppp1cc <dig> in mature human spermatozoa. experiments were performed using sheep anti-ppp1r <dig>  and cbc <dig> antibodies . results showed that ppp1r <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig> are present along the flagellum, in the mid-piece, principal piece, except the end-piece, and also in the head, more specifically in the equatorial and post-acrosomal regions . ppp1cc <dig> localization is similar, co-localizing to the same regions as seen with ppp1r <dig>  a negative control using only secondary antibodies showed that the staining was specific . the ppp1cc <dig> localization corroborated a previous report and the localization is consistent with a role for ppp <dig> in sperm forward and hyperactivated motility and possibly in the acrosome reaction  <cit> . to support the immunolocalization data, ripa soluble extracts and insoluble fractions were resolved by sds-page and immunoblotted . the results showed that ppp1r <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig> were mainly present in the soluble extracts. although ripa lysis buffer is a stringent buffer we still detected some ppp1r <dig> protein in the insoluble fraction. in contrast, ppp1cc <dig> is present in both fractions but more abundantly in the insoluble fraction. these results are consistent with ppp1cc <dig> being tightly attached to the axoneme.

furthermore, tail and head preparations were also obtained using a sucrose gradient. in this separation although heads are kept intact, tails are demembranated and only the axoneme structure is maintained, thus all soluble proteins present in the tail are removed. the results clearly demonstrate that ppp1r <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig>  as well as ppp1cc <dig>  are present in the spermatozoa tail and head and in similar amounts .

phosphorylation of ppp1r2/ppp1r2p <dig> in human sperm
western blotting of human sperm heat-treated extracts revealed, depending on the samples, two bands migrating slower than the purified ppp1r <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig> . to investigate the nature of those bands, human sperm heat-treated extracts were resolved by 2d-page, revealing three isolated spots of different molecular mass and pi, suggesting the existence of different phosphorylated forms of ppp1r <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig> . besides threonine and serine, ppp1r <dig> can also be tyrosine phosphorylated  <cit> . the human sperm heat-treated extract was dephosphorylated by treatment with protein tyrosine phosphatase 1b , calf intestinal phosphatase  and ppp1cc <dig>  under the conditions used, only cip, a nonspecific phosphatase, could dephosphorylate the ppp1r <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig>  with an increase in electrophoretic mobility. this band however did not run at the same molecular mass as recombinant ppp1r <dig> . when sperm ppp1r <dig> was incubated with gsk <dig> or ck <dig> or both, only gsk <dig> was able to induce a mobility shift .

CONCLUSIONS
the data here presented clearly shows that ppp1r <dig> is present in human sperm, based on immunoreactivity and mass spectrometry analysis. this supports the model that the ppp <dig> inhibitor activity identified several years ago can be accounted for by ppp1r <dig>  <cit> . in the past, ppp1r <dig> mrnas of  <dig> Â kb,  <dig> â€“ <dig> Â kb,  <dig> â€“ <dig> Â kb and 4Â kb have been found in rat and rabbit testis  <cit> . these mrnas strictly correspond to the polyadenylation  signals present in ppp1r <dig>  further, a new highly expressed testis-specific  <dig> â€“ <dig> Â kb message, presumably spliced from the ppp1r <dig> gene was also found in rabbit and rat. this message only was detected after 50Â days and not before 20Â days of age in rats  <cit> . another report identified ppp1r <dig> protein in heat-stable extracts of bull testis and mouse testis and sperm  <cit> . of particular relevance we identified, by mass spectrometry, a second ppp1r2-related protein in human sperm, termed ppp1r2p <dig>  this was previously considered to be a pseudogene because it lacks introns, has no parental promoter, and seems to be integrated in the genome at a random new location. pseudogenes originate from retrotransposition activity, so they have truncated 5â€™utr due to the low processivity of the reverse transcriptase, and direct repeats at both ends  <cit> . testis is an organ where many pseudogenes are expressed as mrna and proteins that have been shown to actively participate in spermatogenesis or other germ cell functions  <cit> . transcription in testis, when compared to other somatic tissues, tends to activate alternative promoters, which are otherwise imperfect or weak  <cit> . the apparent function of pseudogenes in testis germ cells could be a way to facilitate the appearance of new genes from the parental ones  <cit> .

previous work suggests that ppp1cc <dig> plays a key role in sperm motility. this enzyme is likely regulated by a mechanism involving reversible phosphorylation of a ppp1r <dig> mediated by gsk <dig> kinase  <cit> . peptides for ppp1cc <dig> were recovered in immunoprecipitates of ppp1r2/ppp1r2p <dig>  indicating the presence of complexes between the enzyme and the inhibitors in sperm. since immunoprecipitation was through antibodies against ppp1r <dig> the presence of other regulatory subunits were not determined. however, the results support the view that at least a proportion of ppp <dig> in sperm is likely to be regulated by ppp1r <dig> proteins. our results also show that ppp1r2p <dig> is phosphorylated by ck <dig> in vitro, probably at residues  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  as shown by the ms-ms spectra, even though the ser <dig> is absent. peptides previously assigned to ppp1r2p <dig> protein may have been derived also from ppp1r <dig>  <cit> . acetylation at ala <dig> and phosphorylation at ser <dig> and ser <dig> were observed by high throughput shotgun ms analysis in human jurkat t cell leukemia and embryonic kidney  cell lines  <cit> . these regions  are similar in both ppp1r <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig> 

ppp1r <dig> interaction with ppp1c involves two primary motifs, 145klhy <dig> and 43ksqkw <dig>  other points of contact in ppp1r <dig> are the n-terminal silk motif  that possibly initiates the binding, and the c-terminal acidic stretch, required for the ppp <dig> activation by gsk <dig>  <cit> . we show for the first time that ppp1r2p <dig> has all the ppp <dig> binding motifs, but lacks the key phosphorylation sites thr <dig> and ser <dig>  these results are consistent with a model whereby ppp1r2p <dig> forms a complex with ppp1c but the activity of this complex would not be regulated by gsk <dig>  the data show that ppp1r2p <dig> protein binds directly to ppp1cc and that this inhibitor cannot be phosphorylated by gsk <dig>  the presence of this protein variant, which may be an irreversible inhibitor of ppp1cc provides for a novel mode of regulating the catalytic activity of the phosphatase .

intrasperm localization analysis showed that both ppp1r2/ppp1r2p <dig> and ppp1cc <dig> co-localize in the same sperm subcellular structures. that is, ppp1cc <dig> is probably bound to the axoneme along with ppp1r2/ppp1r2p <dig> . a previous report showed that ppp <dig> in chlamydomonas is anchored to the central pair apparatus of the axoneme, associated with the c <dig> microtubule and to a lesser extent to the outer doublet microtubules. this axonemal localization suggests that ppp <dig> can control both dynein arms and thereby kinetic activity of the flagellum  <cit> . moreover, ppp1c has a two-fold higher activity in immotile bovine caput epididymal sperm compared to mature motile caudal sperm which is consistent with it being directly involved in sperm motility  <cit> . the regulation of sperm motility by this phosphatase should involve its inhibitors. we hypothesize that in the initial segments of the epididymis  sperm are immotile due to the reversible activity of the ppp1r2/ppp1cc <dig> complexes, while in the latter segments of the epididymis , ppp1r2p <dig> substitutes for ppp1r <dig> as an irreversible inhibitor of ppp1cc <dig> thereby resulting in sperm motility. these independent interactions may be occurring concurrently, since peptides specific for both proteins were identified in ejaculated sperm. since sperm are terminally differentiated cells, essentially devoid of transcriptional and translational activity, regulation occurs through pre-existing proteins and not through new synthesis of proteins. it is possible that ppp1r2p <dig> could be bound to another protein that may keep it from binding to ppp1cc <dig> in immotile caput sperm, in a similar manner to what is suggested to occur with sds <dig>  in caput sperm  <cit> . also, other ppp1cc <dig> complexes exist in sperm as dimers or trimers: such as ppp1r11/ppp1r7/ppp1cc <dig>  <cit> .

this mechanism of controlling sperm motility by ppp1cc <dig> and gsk <dig> may operate only in mammals, since other vertebrate classes do not have this alternatively spliced phosphatase  <cit> . furthermore, ppp1r2p <dig> protein, which is only present in primates, could lead to a novel regulatory mechanism for regulating ppp1cc <dig> activity that might have evolved only in this order. determination of the validity of these possibilities needs further studies. work is in progress in our laboratory to determine the mechanistic role of ppp1r <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig> in regulating ppp1cc <dig> activity and thereby motility and fertility of spermatozoa.
