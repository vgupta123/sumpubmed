BACKGROUND
the locational distribution of genes
it was once thought that the distribution of genes on the chromosomes of eukaryotes was essentially locationally independent, i.e. knowledge of the position of n genes on the chromosome does not help you to find the n + 1th gene . however, recent studies on the genomes of homo sapiens and caenorhabditis elegans have challenged this view  <cit> .

there has been considerable research into the location of genes in prokaryotes since the discovery of the operon in escherichia coli  <cit> . the genome of e. coli has a heterogeneous gene frequency distribution overall  <cit> , but is divided into areas of homogeneous gene frequency  <cit> . recent research has found scale invariant correlations  <cit> , convergence of coregulating regions  <cit> , periodicity  <cit>  and strong compositional asymmetries between leading and lagging strands  <cit> . however, protein synthesis and the structure of the genome in eukaryotes is altogether very different from prokaryotes and consequently the mechanisms affecting gene location in eukaryotes are likely to be very different.

among the many reasons why genes may not be located independently is the process of genetic mutation by tandem duplication. tandem duplications  are genetic mutations where a sequence of nucleotides becomes duplicated, with the duplicated sequence lying adjacent to the original sequence. where tandem duplication extends to duplicating an entire gene, the resulting redundant gene can freely acquire mutations and emerge with a refined or entirely new function  <cit> . tandem duplications that include complete genes may produce clusters of identical genes, which become mutated further through subsequent evolution to produce a cluster of similar genes. when considering gene function, it is likely that these genes will belong to the same functional class.

it is still not clear for eukaryotic genomes whether all gene clusters occur simply as a consequence of genetic mutations such as tandem duplication, or whether there is a functional benefit to gene clustering that conveys an evolutionary advantage. we may gain some insight by isolating the known causes of clustering and analysing the gene distributions that remain.

most research looking into the distribution of genes has focused attention on what are loosely described as clusters  <cit> , and has largely involved analysing histograms of gene loci. in organisms with large genomes, such as homo sapiens, dense clusters of genes are clearly visible in the histograms  <cit> . however, in organisms with more compact genomes, such as a. thaliana, the distribution of genes is more difficult to analyse visually. therefore a more directly statistical approach is required.

the arabidopsis thaliana genome
a. thaliana is one of the most important model systems for identifying genes and determining their functions and its genome was the first complete genome of a plant to be sequenced. sequencing of the genome began in  <dig> by the arabidopsis genome initiative  <cit>  and the results were published by  <dig>  <cit> . the length of the genome of a. thaliana is now thought to be 157mbp  <cit>  and there are roughly  <dig>  genes encoding proteins with a similar functional diversity to drosophila melanogaster, and caenorhabditis elegans.

roughly 17% of all genes are arranged in tandem arrays comprising  <dig> tandem duplicate genes, most of which are in pairs. altogether, there are  <dig> tandem arrays and the two longest arrays have more than  <dig> adjacent tandemly repeated genes  <cit> .

research continues on the genome of a. thaliana and of note is a major re-annotation of the entire genome in  <dig>  <cit> . the latest data from many contributors can be found on the tigr and tair websites.

methodology overview
in the first part of this study we analyse the locational distribution of all known genes after removing tandem duplicates and genes in the centromeric regions. we use a sliding window analysis where we take the standard deviation of the results as a measure of the degree of clustering and compare with randomly generated sequences of gene locations . if tandem duplication and the centromeres are the sole causes of clustering we would expect to obtain locationally independent distributions, which would be statistically related to distributions of genes placed at random on a simulated chromosome. however, the results reveal that, after the removal of the centromeres and tandem repeats, the distribution of all known genes is still locationally dependent.

further in this study we analyse the locational distribution of genes classified by molecular function. here we introduce greenwood's spacing statistic which uses the distances between points or the time between events to give a comparative measure of clustering of those points or events. low values are indicative of points being evenly spaced apart, whereas high values indicate that points are clustered. values roughly half way between indicate that the points are distributed at random. we compare the results with those of randomly selected gene locations on the original sequence . this gives us a relative measure of how clustered or how evenly spaced the distribution is compared to a locationally independent distribution. we establish the locationally independent distribution using monte carlo methods  <cit>  and by using this method we do not need to exclude genes in the centromere, but we do exclude tandem duplicates.

again, the results reveal that the distribution of molecular functional classes of genes is not locationally independent.

RESULTS
distributions of all genes
the results for the distribution of all genes without tandem duplicates are briefly summarized in table  <dig>  which shows that the genes on all five chromosomes of a. thaliana are significantly more clustered than would be expected from a locationally independent distribution.

 table detailing the ranking, the standard deviation in the distribution of the original genes , the mean of  <dig> standard deviations from the monte carlo simulations  and the standard error  on all five chromosomes . the standard deviation gives us a measure of clustering and the difference between original sd and mean mc sd divided by std err gives us the significance 

we can use the standard deviation as a measure of clustering, as explained later in the methods section, and we can use the standard error as a measure of the significance of the result. we establish the null hypothesis from the mean standard deviation of  <dig> monte carlo trials of randomly generated chromosomes. refering to table  <dig>  we can see that the standard deviation  for chromosome i is  <dig>  and the mean standard deviation for  <dig> monte carlo trials of randomly generated chromosomes  is  <dig> . the standard error for the size of this data set  is  <dig> . the difference between the standard deviations divided by the standard error is  <dig> ; i.e. the standard deviation for chromosome i is  <dig>  standard errors from the null hypothesis. any result greater than two standard errors should be considered significant  <cit>  so we can see that this result is very significant.

the standard deviation of the distribution of genes on chromosomes i, ii, iv and v ranked  <dig> out of  <dig> monte carlo simulations of a random chromosome. the standard deviations for these chromosomes exceeded  <dig> standard errors of the mean standard deviation for the monte carlo simulations. the standard deviation of chromosome iii ranked  <dig> out of  <dig> and had a value of  <dig>  standard errors from the mean, which indicates that this result is significant, but there is a slim chance that this distribution could occur by chance.

further to our analysis of the distribution of the locations of all known genes, the probability density plots of the gap lengths between genes for all five chromosomes are given in figure  <dig>  these plots reveal that the most frequently occurring gap lengths are between  <dig> and  <dig> base pairs  on all five chromosomes. note that the p values given in the abstract are obtained from the ranking thus:-

the locational distribution of functional classes of genes
the full results for the distribution of individual functional classes are listed in tables 1– <dig> in additional file  <dig>  the tables are arranged so that each table lists the results for each of the five chromosomes over four levels of the gene ontology hierarchy  making  <dig> tables in total.

the greenwood statistic of each functional class was compared to  <dig> monte carlo simulations of a random distribution of the same number of genes as found in each functional class. the average rankings of the greenwood statistic for all classes in all four levels of the gene ontology hierarchy across all five chromosomes are listed in table  <dig>  these show that, in general, the functional classes are more clustered than would be expected from a locationally independent distribution. furthermore, 12% of functional classes in level  <dig> were super-clustered having a ranking of  <dig> out of  <dig> 

average ranking of all the functional classes analysed with and without tandem duplicates  on all five chromosomes of a. thaliana from four levels of the gene ontology hierarchy showing that the degree of clustering of the distribution of broadly classified genes is similar to that of the more specific classifications

for each class there are ten results representing the relative ranking of the greenwood statistic compared to the null hypothesis, one for each strand on each of the five chromosomes. the individual results can be found in tables 1– <dig> in the additional file. to better visualize these results for the  <dig> most populated functional classes at level  <dig> we used the r statistics software package  <cit>  to create box and whisker plots   <cit>  and these are displayed in figure  <dig>  note that rankings range from  <dig> to  <dig> and a ranking of  <dig> represent the results we would expect from a locationally independent distribution. rankings below  <dig> are increasingly evenly spaced distributions and rankings above  <dig> are increasingly clustered distributions. the circles represent outliers as interpreted by the default boxplot parameters of the r statistics software.

clustered distributions
the functional classifications at level  <dig> are very broad. it is therefore surprising that there is a marked difference in the degree of clustering among the functional classes. the plots of the genes associated with structural molecule activity , anti oxidant activity , translation regulator activity  and nutrient reservoir classification  are examples of the distributions that might be expected from these broad classifications, as they show no significant clustering on all five chromosomes for these functional classes. however, most of the functional classes show a high degree of clustering that prevails across all five chromosomes. the plots for genes associated with catalytic activity , transporter activity , enzyme regulator activity , transcription regulator activity  and binding  indicate that these functional classes are consistently and very highly clustered throughout the genome.

a number of molecular function subclasses of the five main clustered classes mentioned above are also super-clustered having a ranking of  <dig> out of  <dig>  referring to the results in the tables in the additional file it can be seen that at level  <dig> we found five out of ten super-clustered instances of transcription factor activity , which is a subclass of transcription regulator activity. for the binding class we found  <dig> out of  <dig> super-clustered instances of nucleic acid binding , one of nucleotide binding , one of protein binding  and one of lipid binding  and at level  <dig> we have one instance of dna binding  and one of purine nucleotide binding . finally, there are  <dig> super-clustered subclasses of catalytic activity, which can be found on levels  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  with catalytic activity class members displaying such a consistency in clustering it was surprising to find that there was one class member at level  <dig>  calcium ion binding , that had one instance displaying a very evenly spaced distribution with a ranking of  <dig> out of  <dig>  looking at molecular function classes from all levels in the go hierarchy we found  <dig> instances of evenly spaced distributions with a ranking of  <dig> or less out of  <dig>  which were all members of three of the five main clustered classes, with just two exceptions that belonged to the signal transducer activity class .

we repeated these statistical analyses without removal of tandem duplicates. this resulted in slightly more evidence for clustering but did not affect any major conclusion. the results of this analysis are summarised in figure  <dig> 

evenly spaced distributions
we also took a closer look at three specific molecular function classes at level  <dig> in the go hierarchy which showed very evenly spaced distributions. these were calcium ion binding activity, g-protein receptor activity and metallopeptidase activity.

genes associated with calcium ion binding activity  have a very evenly spaced distribution on the w strand on chromosome iv, having a greenwood statistic ranking of  <dig> out of  <dig>  closer analysis of these  <dig> genes shows that 9% of these genes are tandem duplicated compared to the average of 17% for all genes. using the agi data for tandem duplicates,  <dig> tandem arrays were identified,  <dig> tandem pairs and one tandem triplet. there were no observed tandem duplications on the w strand of chromosome iv.

genes associated with g-protein coupled receptor activity  displayed more evenly spaced distributions on both w and c strands on chromosome iv with statistic rankings falling in the lowest 4%. there are  <dig> genes associated with g-protein receptor activity  in a. thaliana, but only eight tandem duplicates have been identified. furthermore, there were no tandem duplications on chromosomes ii and iv. this class was particularly interesting because we found evenly spaced distributions and no tandem duplications on both strands of chromosome iv. however, there are also no tandem duplications on chromosome ii, which has a highly clustered distribution. n.b. the location of g protein coupled receptor activity genes in the human genome are frequently distributed in tandem arrays. of the  <dig> genes associated with metallopeptidase activity  only  <dig> were tandem duplications with one pair on chromosome i and two pairs and an array of four tandem duplications on chromosome v. this functional class has an average ranking for chromosomes i, ii, iii and v that is similar to the average ranking for all functional classes, but this class on chromosome iv ranks in the bottom 10% indicating a very evenly spaced distribution. this would indicate that evenly spaced distributions are not necessarily dependent on gene molecular function class.

these three molecular function classes where we have found evenly spaced distributions all have a lower than average frequency of tandem duplications.

discussion
we have seen evidence of very high levels of clustering even after the removal of tandem duplicates for half of the number of molecular function classes at level  <dig>  the remaining half showed higher than average levels of clustering compared to the monte carlo simulation with just one exception. throughout the subclass levels  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> we find both extremes in that there are frequent occurrences of super-clustered distributions and a number of distributions that are more evenly spaced than we would expect. although it must be considered that the evenly spaced distributions could just possibly have occurred by chance, this seems unlikely and we consider these anomalous distributions to be worthy of more research.

tandem duplication is thought to be one of the principal mechanisms of gene proliferation and is also thought to be the main cause of clustering. our results confirm that tandem duplication is a cause of clustering, but is unlikely to be the sole cause. the results of the further analysis of genes associated with g protein coupled receptor activity in a. thaliana indicate clearly that tandem duplications are not the only process that generate gene clustering since the distribution of this class on chromosome ii is clustered, but contains no tandem duplications.

another observation regarding tandem duplications is that genes of many individual classes show roughly the same degree of clustering across both strands on all five chromosomes, and this indicates that clustering is in some way dependent on gene molecular function. this may further imply that tandem duplications are gene molecular function dependent.

there are many reasons to expect clustered gene functional distributions as we have already discussed. there is also strong evidence for clustering of structurally related genes in the human genome   <cit> . it was therefore surprising to find that some functional classes on some chromosomes were significantly more evenly spaced than would be expected by chance. the evenly spaced distribution of some functional classes would imply something about the nature of genes of that molecular function. we have found that the classes displaying even distributions have fewer than average tandem repeats. it would seem that some gene functional classes do not appear to be so prone to tandem duplication. but since tandem duplication is not the only cause of clustering there is likely to be other factors involved. for example, there maybe an evolutionary advantage in distributing essential genes evenly across the genome.

other factors affecting the locational distribution of gene functional classes may include the  <dig> dimensional structure of the chromosome itself. the degree of coiling of the chromatin varies during the life cycle of the cell. when the chromatin is tightly coiled or highly condensed the number of genes physically available for expression is low. more genes are available for expression during the phases required for cell division when the chromatin is decondensed. the chromatin exists in a partially condensed state when a cell has matured. evidently, in the matured state, less genes are physically available for expression and clearly the genes required for the specific functions of the matured cell must be available. these genes will need to be located in regions of the chromatin that are available for expression and this could lead to both clustering and even spacing. clustering because essential genes available for expression will occur in the physically accessible areas. even spacing because the coiling of the chromatin will lead to physically accessible regions having an inherent cyclic nature and essential genes located in these areas will have an evenly spaced distribution on the primary structure of the genome.

CONCLUSIONS
the distribution of all genes and the distribution of individual functional classes of genes in arabidopsis thaliana were found to be more clustered than we would expect from a locationally independent distribution; and although tandem duplications contribute considerably to clustering, they are clearly not the only factor affecting the observed clustered distributions. this result is consistent with the observations of mayor et al  <cit>  on the distribution of protein structural domains in the human genome. we found three molecular function classes in a. thaliana that are significantly more evenly distributed than would be expected from a locationally independent distribution. the mechanism for this evenness is unknown. both the evidence clustering and the evidence of evenness implies that there are unexplained elements of order in the locational distribution of genes in a thaliana.
