BACKGROUND
the wnt signaling pathway plays an essential role during embryonic and postnatal muscle development  <cit>  because it regulates the expression of myogenic regulatory factors, which are essential for myogenic lineage progression and the formation of functional multinucleated myotubes  <cit> . the wnt signaling pathway also simultaneously promotes myogenic and inhibits adipogenic differentiation within primary adult myoblasts  <cit> . during adult skeletal muscle regeneration, the wnt signaling pathway is involved in satellite cell proliferation and differentiation as well as in self-renewal  <cit> . secreted frizzled-related protein  <dig>  is a member of the sfrp family that inhibits wnt signaling  <cit> . the sfrps inhibit wnt receptor binding to down-regulate pathway signaling during development  <cit> . the sfrp gene family has five members  in the mouse and human genomes  <cit> , which play important roles in developmental and oncogenic processes  <cit> . the addition of recombinant sfrp <dig> and sfrp <dig> to c2c <dig> or primary satellite cells may inhibit myotube formation; therefore, sfrp <dig> and sfrp <dig> act to prevent myoblasts from entering the terminal differentiation process  <cit> . additionally, sfrp <dig> also controls vascular cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo  <cit> .

micrornas are a class of small, single-stranded, noncoding rna  that occur in the genomes of plants and animals. they function post-transcriptionally by interacting directly with 3′-utrs of mrnas to repress their expression by translational inhibition, mrna degradation, or both  <cit> . mirnas are involved in multiple biological processes, including development  <cit> , cancer  <cit> , cell differentiation  <cit> , apoptosis  <cit> , and metabolism  <cit> . moreover, mirnas play a modulatory role in the development and growth of skeletal muscles  <cit> . three mirnas, mirna- <dig>  − <dig> and − <dig>  are specifically expressed in muscle and are considered to be myomirs  <cit> . mirna- <dig> and mirna- <dig> are expressed in both cardiac and skeletal muscles  <cit>  and mirna- <dig> is only expressed in skeletal muscle  <cit> . mirna- <dig> and mirna- <dig> regulate skeletal muscle satellite cell proliferation and differentiation by repressing the paired box  <dig>  gene  <cit> . these two mirnas also promote myogenesis by targeting the histone deacetylase  <dig>  and the largest subunit of dna polymerase α , whereas mirna- <dig> may inhibit myoblast differentiation and increase proliferation by repressing the serum response factor   <cit> . our recent study documented that mirna- <dig> and mirna- <dig> were abundantly and specifically expressed in porcine skeletal muscle  <cit> .

in our previous study, we conducted mrna and mirna transcriptome profiling on prenatal skeletal muscle of tongcheng pigs at  <dig>   <dig> and 90 days post-coitus  using the microarray analysis. integrated analysis of mirna and mrna suggested that sfrp <dig> and mirna-1/ <dig> exhibited opposite expression patterns and potentially interacted during prenatal skeletal muscle development. to further explore the biological functions and regulatory mechanisms of sfrp <dig> gene and mirna-1/ <dig> in porcine muscle development, we analyzed the temporal and spatial expression patterns of mirna- <dig> and sfrp <dig> in prenatal and postnatal skeletal muscle at  <dig> developmental stages. subsequently, the interaction between sfrp <dig> and mirna-1/ <dig> was validated using dual luciferase and western-blot assays.

sequence analysis of the porcine sfrp <dig> gene
the sfrp <dig> protein sequences  were retrieved from the genbank database. first, the amino acid sequence of porcine sfrp <dig> was compared with those of the human, mouse and rat, and the alignment results showed that the protein sequence of the pig had a six amino acid depletion. the porcine sfrp <dig> polypeptide exhibited  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % similarity with the human, mouse and rat homologs, respectively . based on the phylogenetic tree analysis, the protein sequence of the pig was closely related to that of cow, while the rat and mouse formed another closely related group, and these four species formed a group with the humans . smart software was used to predict sfrp <dig> protein domains. the precursor protein of sfrp <dig> contained a frizzled domain and a netrin c-terminal domain. the sites of sfrp <dig> protein localization had a  <dig> % possibility of being extracellular, a  <dig> % possibility of being cytoplasmic and a  <dig> % possibility of being in the endoplasmic reticulum. additionally, the theoretical isoelectric point  and molecular weight  of sfrp <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda, respectively.figure  <dig>

distribution of porcine sfrp <dig> mrna and mirna- <dig> in tissues
the expression of sfrp <dig> and mirna- <dig> was measured in seven tissues from adult tongcheng pigs. the sfrp <dig> gene was highly expressed in the kidney, liver, lung, spleen and small intestine, moderately expressed in the heart, and weakly expressed in the longissimus dorsi muscle . however, mirna- <dig> was abundantly expressed in the longissimus dorsi muscle and heart, and was weakly expressed in the other tissues .figure  <dig>

developmental expression of porcine sfrp <dig> mrna and mirna-206
we collected the longissimus dorsi muscle from  <dig> prenatal and postnatal developmental stages of tongcheng pigs. quantitative real-time pcr indicated that sfrp <dig> was highly expressed at the e <dig> stage, and was then down-regulated from e <dig> to e <dig>  it was then up-regulated from e <dig> to e <dig> and down-regulated from e <dig> to e <dig>  subsequently, it was up-regulated from the e <dig> to e <dig>  and then down-regulated again from e <dig> to d <dig>  the expression of sfrp <dig> was maintained at a stable low level in postnatal skeletal muscle. in postnatal myogenesis, sfrp <dig> was consistently expressed from days  <dig> to  <dig>  subsequently, it decreased and reached a minimum at d <dig> . the expression of mirna- <dig> was weak in skeletal muscle in the early embryonic stages, but then remained stable with high levels of expression in the remaining prenatal stages, although some fluctuations occurred. the expression level of mirna- <dig> reached a peak at e <dig>  in postnatal muscle, mirna- <dig> was down-regulated from d <dig> to d <dig> and was up-regulated from d <dig> to d <dig> .

co-expression analysis of sfrp <dig> and microrna-1/206
tang et al. have explored the spatial and dynamic expression of mirna- <dig> in the tongcheng pig   <cit> . according to their study and this study, mirna- <dig> and mirna- <dig> were abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle and weakly expressed in other tissues. in contrast, sfrp <dig> was expressed at very low levels in adult skeletal muscle. the co-expression analysis revealed that the sfpr <dig> mrna was significantly negatively correlated with mirna- <dig>   and mirna- <dig>   at the mrna level in different tissues adult tissues.figure  <dig>

during skeletal muscle development, sfpr <dig> had a higher expression level in the prenatal stages than in the postnatal stages. however, in contrast to sfrp <dig>  mirna-1/ <dig> exhibited a relatively higher level of expression in postnatal muscle compared with prenatal muscle. sfrp <dig> mrna was significantly negatively correlated with mirna-1/ <dig> . these results indicated that sfrp <dig> expression might be regulated by mir-1/ <dig> in pigs.

sfrp <dig> is a putative target of microrna-1/206
the prediction from the mirna-mrna profiles and bioinformatics suggested that sfrp <dig> was potentially a mirna-1/ <dig> target in pigs. in the 3′-utr region of sfrp <dig> mrna, a putative binding site was identified  . the seed sequence of mirna-1/ <dig> and the target-binding site between sfrp <dig> and mirna-1/  <dig> were highly conserved across mammals .figure  <dig>

to validate whether sfrp <dig> was directly targeted by mirna-1/ <dig> in pigs, we constructed the psicheck2-sfrp1-3′-utr , a luciferase reporter vector. subsequently, mirna-1and mirna- <dig> mimics and a normal control  were co-transfected into piecs, and luciferase activity was detected. the mirna- <dig> mimic-transfected group exhibited  <dig> % less luciferase activity compared with the nc group  and the mirna- <dig> mimic-transfected group exhibited  <dig> % less luciferase activity compared with the control  . to further validate the specific target site, the binding region of the sfrp <dig> 3′-utr was mutated by bridge pcr . the luciferase activity of the psicheck-2-sfrp1–3′-utr  was not significantly decreased by both the mirna- <dig> and mirna- <dig> mimics   .figure  <dig>

then, we determined whether sfrp <dig> was affected by mirna-1/ <dig> at the protein level. the overexpression vector of sfrp <dig> was constructed and transfected into piecs, and the quantitative real-time pcr  results showed that the expression of sfrp <dig> was increased approximately 16-fold compared with the nc group. this result indicated that the sfrp <dig> overexpression vector was successful . the porcine sfrp1-cds-3′-utr-psicheck- <dig> vector was constructed, and it was co-transfected with mirna- <dig> and mirna- <dig> mimics in piecs. the western blot results showed that the protein level of sfrp <dig> in the groups containing mirna-1/ <dig> mimics was decreased compared with the nc group . these results suggested that the sfrp <dig> gene was a target of mirna-1/ <dig> figure  <dig>

discussion
we predicted the targets of mirna-1/ <dig> with the targetscan and pictar programs. among the putative targets, many genes had been validated by previous studies, such as hdac <dig>  <cit> , gja <dig>  kcnj <dig>  <cit> , pola <dig>  <cit> , and met  <cit> . however, all these results were based on myoblast c2c <dig> cells in vitro. few reports have considered mirna-1/ <dig> targets during skeletal muscle development in vivo, particularly in pigs. to discover potential targets of mirna-1/ <dig> during swine myogenesis, we conducted go and kegg pathway analyses of targets based on the prediction data. the results suggested that these targets were significantly enriched in the wnt signaling pathway . wnts signaling proteins are secreted proteins that function in differentiation, embryonic development and cell proliferation  <cit> . the wnt pathways play an important role in the formation of muscle fibers during prenatal  <cit>  and postnatal myogenesis with the activation of stem cells in the adult muscles  <cit> . sfrp <dig>  a secreted antagonist of the wnt-frizzled pathway, was predicted to be a target of mirna-1/ <dig> and to participate in the wnt signaling pathway. the expression of sfrp <dig> mrna was up-regulated in muscle regeneration  <cit>  and in skeletal muscle after denervation  <cit> . additionally, an impairment of the wnt-frizzled pathway via sfrp <dig> over-expression controlled proliferation and neovascularization after muscle ischemia  <cit> . a comparison of the amino acid sequence of pig sfrp <dig> with those of human, rat and mouse demonstrated remarkably high similarity across species, and the frizzled domain and netrin c-terminal domain were especially highly conserved.

previous studies reported sfrp <dig> expression at the mrna level in various tissues, such as the brain, kidney and heart, and that the transcript was present both in the adult and during embryogenesis  <cit> . moreover, sfrp <dig> was weakly expressed in matured skeletal muscles  <cit> . the qpcr results for sfrp <dig> in various adult porcine tissues were mostly consistent with these reports. these results indicated that sfrp <dig> had almost no antagonistic effect in adult skeletal muscle. postnatal muscle growth is largely determined by the total number of fibers, which is determined by two major waves of fiber generation before birth: primary muscle fiber formation at 35– <dig> dpc and assemblage of secondary muscle fibers at 54– <dig> dpc  <cit> . the sfrp <dig> gene was down-regulated in skeletal muscle from e <dig> to e <dig> in tongcheng pigs, indicating that sfrp <dig> was primarily involved in the formation of primary muscle fibers. we also found that the expression of sfrp <dig> was higher in embryonic skeletal muscle compared with postnatal skeletal muscle. mirna- <dig>  meanwhile, was abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart, and up-regulated from pre- to postnatal-stage skeletal muscle. these results demonstrated that mir- <dig> plays a key role in skeletal muscle development in pigs. sfrp <dig> primarily affected skeletal muscle development in embryonic stages. wnts signaling contributes to the overall process of myogenesis by activating myogenic regulatory factor genes such as myf <dig> and myod  <cit> . mirna-1/ <dig> promoted skeletal muscle satellite cell proliferation and differentiation  <cit>  and sfrp <dig> might inhibit myoblast differentiation  <cit> . the temporal expression patterns of mirna-1/ <dig> and sfrp <dig> in tongcheng pigs were consistent with these previous findings.

the mrna-mirna co-expression correlation analysis was reported to identify the putative targets of mirna  <cit> , and this method could improve the positive rate for identifying the mrna target genes of mirna. mirna- <dig> and mirna- <dig> were abundant in the postnatal stages and were at low levels in the prenatal stages of muscle development, while sfrp <dig> exhibited an opposite expression patterns. correlation analysis revealed that the sfpr <dig> was significantly negatively correlated with mirna-1/ <dig> , and these results indicate that sfrp <dig> is potentially regulated by mirna-1/ <dig> 

the interaction between sfrp <dig> and mirna-1/ <dig> in pigs has not been previously reported. this study demonstrated that sfrp <dig> expression was regulated by mirna-1/ <dig>  the sfrp <dig> 3′-utr sequence around the mirna-1/ <dig> target sites and the seed sequence of mature mirna-1/ <dig> are well conserved in mammals, which suggests that the target region is important in sfrp <dig> regulation and that the regulation of sfrp <dig> by mirna-1/ <dig> may also exist in other species. similar results were observed in other mirna studies  <cit> .

the luciferase activity of psicheck- <dig> containing the sfrp <dig> 3′-utr sequence was significantly decreased by co-transfection with mirna-1/ <dig> mimics . however, with the sfrp <dig> 3′-utr mutant sequence, activity was not significantly decreased . these results indicated that the target binding site was specific and unique in pigs, and that mirna-1/ <dig> might repress sfrp <dig> expression by degrading the mrna transcripts. we propose that sfrp <dig> is regulated by mirna-1/ <dig>  is >involved in the proliferation of muscle cells, and affects prenatal skeletal muscle development. moreover, we explored the interactions between sfrp <dig> and mirna-1/ <dig> at the protein level, and western-blot analysis confirmed that sfrp <dig> was significantly down-regulated by mirna-1/ <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we predicted the target genes of mirna-1/ <dig> and performed a functional annotation of the target genes. we performed a molecular characterization analysis of the porcine sfrp <dig> gene,, which was one of the predicted targets for mirna-1/ <dig>  we also explored the spatial-temporal profile of sfrp <dig> mrna and mirna- <dig> in adult tissues and in skeletal muscle tissues during development in tongcheng pigs. the results indicated that sfrp <dig> was primarily involved in prenatal skeletal muscle development. finally, we verified that porcine sfrp <dig> was a target of mirna-1/ <dig> using dual luciferase and western blot assay. these results increase our understanding of the biological functions of sfrp <dig> and mirna-1/ <dig> in skeletal muscle development.
