BACKGROUND
the mammalian  target of rapamycin complex 1/ribosomal protein s <dig> kinase  <dig>  signalling is a critical regulator of skeletal muscle mass and metabolism, and mechanisms that regulate it are studied as possible targets for the treatment/prevention of loss of muscle mass in diverse muscle atrophying conditions  <cit> . however, the exact mechanism by which s6k <dig> regulates muscle mass and metabolism remains to be identified. substrates of s6k <dig> proposed to mediate its actions are all factors that associate with or regulate mrna translation initiation. these include the ribosomal protein s <dig>  and the eukaryotic mrna translation initiation factor 4b , both of which upon activation induce mrna translation initiation. s6k <dig> also phosphorylates eukaryotic mrna translation elongation factor  <dig>  kinase, an inhibitor of mrna translation . in skeletal muscle, concurrent increase in phosphorylation of s6k <dig>  s <dig> and eif4b are observed in conditions that stimulate muscle protein synthesis, including resistance exercise, provision of amino acid, and stimulation with insulin/igf- <dig>  <cit> . however, the functions/regulation of these substrates do not account for the actions of s6k <dig> in controlling mrna translation initiation and muscle mass  <cit> , suggesting a role for other substrates of this kinase.

programmed cell death  <dig> ,   <cit> , h <dig>  <cit> , and interleukin- <dig> inducible human gene 197/15a  <cit>  ), is a more recently discovered substrate of s6k <dig>  <cit> . in the hypo phosphorylated state, it binds to both eif4a and eif4g, leading to both the inhibition of the helicase activity of eif4a and of the formation of eif4f complex. these changes will lead to the suppression of translation of mrna with secondary structures at their 5′-utr ends  <cit> . upon mitogen stimulation, activated s6k <dig> phosphorylates ser <dig> in pdcd <dig>  this targets it for ubiquitination by the ubiquitin protein ligase beta-transducin repeat containing protein  and subsequent degradation by the proteasome  <cit> .

much of what is known about pdcd <dig> is from cancer studies where pdcd <dig> is proposed to function as a cell cycle inhibitor/tumor suppressor. loss of this protein is associated with invasion, progression or increased aggression of numerous, but not all  <cit> , cancers, including ovarian  <cit> , lung  <cit> , breast  <cit> , liver  <cit>  and colon cancers  <cit> . as a substrate of mtorc1/s6k <dig>  pdcd <dig> may mediate the effect of this kinase pathway on protein synthesis in skeletal muscle. however, not much is known about the role or regulation of pdcd <dig> in muscle, the tissue that is quantitatively the most important in whole body protein metabolism. it was recently shown that the abundance of pdcd <dig> in rat skeletal muscle is sensitive to feeding and food deprivation cycle: its abundance increased in skeletal muscle of food-deprived rats, but in fed or refed rats, its abundance decreased along with increase in muscle fractional protein synthesis  <cit> . these data suggest that interventions that regulate pdcd <dig> abundance may be explored in the treatment of muscle wasting, a feature of diseases like cancer, aids, and trauma. however this study was mainly correlative and did not examine whether or not mtorc1/s6k <dig> is required for pdcd <dig> regulation in muscle.

in the present work, using l <dig> myotubes, our specific objectives were to: 1) examine the requirement for mtorc1/s6k <dig> and the ubiquitin proteolytic system in regulating pdcd4; 2) examine the contribution of amino acids vs. growth factors in mediating the effect of nutrition on pdcd4; and 3) determine whether nutritional status affects the interaction of pdcd <dig> with components of eif4f. because others have suggested that signalling pathways that regulate protein metabolism may be regulated differently in myotubes versus myoblasts  <cit>  and because the regulation of pdcd <dig> may depend on cell type  <cit> , we also assessed the effect of pdcd <dig> depletion by rna interference  on myotube total and myofibrillar protein synthesis.

RESULTS
abundance of pdcd <dig> in l <dig> myotubes is sensitive to medium composition and requires mtorc <dig> and the proteasome
given the identification of pdcd <dig> as a substrate of mtorc1/s6k <dig> signalling, and the fact this kinase pathway is regulated by nutrients, we examined the effect of nutrient deprivation on the regulation pdcd <dig> in l <dig> myotubes. neither 12 h of serum and amino acid deprivation nor refeeding in a complete medium had any significant effect on pdcd <dig> ser <dig>  phosphorylation . furthermore, serum and amino acid deprivation had no effect on phosphorylation on ser <dig>  although phosphorylation on this residue was increased by refeeding . however, pdcd <dig> abundance increased more than four-fold in starved cells and decreased progressively with time during refeeding such that by 3 h of refeeding, values in re-fed cells were not different from control . incubation with rapamycin, an mtorc <dig> inhibitor, abolished the effect of re-feeding on pdcd <dig> abundance .

because the ubiquitin system is implicated in the phosphorylation-dependent degradation of pdcd <dig>  we incubated the cells with mg <dig>  a proteasome inhibitor. like rapamycin, addition of mg <dig> prevented the disappearance of pdcd <dig> during re-feeding .

growth factors, but not amino acids, regulate pdcd <dig> abundance
the experiments above did not indicate whether the observed effects of refeeding were due to nutrients or growth factors. to address this question, we repeated the starvation experiment but re-fed the myotubes in either the differentiation medium, serum-free amem, or starvation medium supplemented with leucine, dialyzed fbs or horse serum. only media that contained serum promoted the degradation of pdcd <dig> .

association of pdcd <dig> with eif4a in l <dig> myotubes is sensitive to medium composition
pdcd <dig> inhibits mrna translation initiation at least in part by its binding to eif4a and eif4g. the amount of pdcd <dig> found in eif4a immunoprecipitate was increased by starvation but fell gradually during refeeding, especially at 3 h, at which time the values were not different from those observed in fed cells . in another experiment, we carried out the reciprocal immunoprecipitation. the amount of eif4a in pdcd <dig> immunoprecipitate was unchanged by treatments; however, because starvation increased pdcd <dig> abundance in the immunocomplex, the ratio of eif4a to pdcd <dig> was suppressed by starvation. this was reversed by refeeding . in addition, the pattern of eif4g association with pdcd <dig> was similar to that observed for eif4a; however, the effect of refeeding was not seen until the 3 h time point . finally we examined the effects of mtorc <dig> inhibition on the interactions. in all cases, the effect of refeeding on the interactions of pdcd <dig> with eif4a and 4g was sensitive to rapamycin .

pdcd <dig> depletion in myotubes had modest effect on protein synthesis
to examine the significance of pdcd <dig> in regulating myotube mixed protein synthesis, we used rnai to deplete this protein  and then measured incorporation of phenylalanine into myotube proteins. in fed cells , incorporation of phenylalanine into mixed proteins in cells deprived of pdcd <dig> was not different from the value in those treated with scrambled oligonucleotides . in cells deprived of serum but supplied with amino acids , phenylalanine incorporation into proteins in cells treated with pdcd <dig> sirna # <dig> was 86% of values in those treated with scrambled sirna ; the values in those treated with pdcd <dig> sirna # <dig> was 67% of those treated with scrambled sirna . in another experiment, pdcd <dig> deprived cells were incubated in medium lacking both serum and amino acids . incorporation of phenylalanine into myotube total mixed proteins in cells treated with the two pdcd <dig> sirna oligonucleotides was 72-80% of the values in cells treated with scrambled sirna oligonucleotides . finally we examined the effect of pdcd <dig> on the regulation of myofibrillar proteins. depletion of pdcd <dig> led to a 30% reduction in phenylalanine incorporation into myofibrillar proteins .

the finding of reduced protein synthesis in cells deprived of pdcd <dig> was surprising given the inhibitory role of this protein on mrna translation and our previous finding in myoblast. thus we carried out two additional control experiments. first, we repeated the myoblast experiments and showed that as before, in starved cells, pdcd <dig> depletion increased protein synthesis by 43% . finally, we used sirna oligonucleotides purchased from another company  to silence pdcd <dig> in myotubes. protein synthesis in myotubes deprived of pdcd <dig> was reduced by 21% .

to gain insight into the mechanisms of effect of pdcd <dig> knockdown on myotube protein synthesis, we examined the regulation of components of mtorc <dig> signalling and mrna translation initiation. although starvation predictably reduced the phosphorylation of 4e-bp <dig> and increased the binding of 4e-bp <dig> to eif4e, pdcd <dig> depletion had no effects on these parameters . likewise, in starved myotubes, pdcd <dig> depletion had no effect on s6k <dig> or s <dig> phosphorylation . however, there was a trend towards reduced eif4g in cells depleted of pdcd <dig> . furthermore, pdcd <dig> depletion significantly reduced eif4g interaction with eif4e .

discussion
in this study, we demonstrated that in myotubes, the regulation of pdcd <dig> abundance was reversibly modified by a starvation-refeeding cycle. collectively, the data presented here are the first evidence to demonstrate a requirement for mtorc <dig> and the proteasome in regulating the abundance of pdcd <dig> in muscle cells. we also presented evidence that, at least in myotubes, in the absence of growth factors, amino acids had little effect in regulating the abundance of this protein. finally, in starved myotubes, and contrary to observations in myoblasts  <cit>  and non muscle cells  <cit> , depletion of pdcd <dig> had minimal effect on the incorporation of phenylalanine into myotube proteins. rather, in starved myotubes, pdcd <dig> depletion further reduced eif4g binding to eif4e.

in spite of the fact that pdcd <dig> has been characterized as a substrate of s6k <dig> and an inhibitor of cap-dependent mrna translation initiation, there is a paucity of information on the significance of pdcd <dig> in skeletal muscle. also, it is unknown if the regulation of pdcd <dig>  like mtorc1/s6k <dig>  is sensitive to nutrients. in the present study, ser <dig> and ser <dig> phosphorylation of pdcd <dig> correlates poorly with its abundance. a requirement for mtorc1/s6k <dig> in regulating pdcd <dig> abundance suggests that pdcd <dig> may be phosphorylated on additional residues. however, pdcd <dig> degradation appears to depend specifically on ser <dig> phosphorylation  <cit> . it is also possible that phosphorylated pdcd <dig> does not accumulate because degradation by the proteasome is very rapid. however, in refed cells treated with mg <dig>  ser <dig> phosphorylated pdcd <dig> did not accumulate to a greater extent in comparison with cells not treated with the drug .

although amino acids can activate mtorc <dig>  <cit> , the effects of amino acids require some amount of insulin  <cit> . our finding that leucine or a medium that contained all the  <dig> amino acids but lacked growth factors had insignificant effects on pdcd <dig> abundance is consistent with this view. akt too may phosphorylate pdcd <dig> and target it for degradation  <cit> . in fact, a requirement for serum rather than amino acids might implicate akt rather than mtorc1/s6k <dig> in the phosphorylation and degradation of pdcd <dig> since akt does not require amino acid for its activation  <cit> . however, incubation with rapamycin would not only inhibit mtorc1/s6k <dig> but should lead to a greater activation of pi3k-akt pathway due to the loss of negative inhibition conveyed by activated s6k <dig> . in our study, the fact that inhibition with rapamycin during a 1-h refeeding completely prevented the disappearance of pdcd <dig> clearly suggests that mtorc1/s6k <dig> is the main pathway that targets pdcd <dig> for degradation in myotubes.

our data showing that pdcd <dig> knock down suppressed incorporation of phenylalanine into myotube mixed proteins are surprising, given the characterization of the protein as an mrna translation initiation inhibitor. furthermore, depletion of pdcd <dig> in myoblasts  and in non muscle cells  <cit>  increases protein synthesis. a possible explanation might be that the regulation of myofibrillar proteins, the predominant proteins in myotubes, is different from that of total protein. however, we showed that incorporation of phenylalanine into myofibrillar proteins in cells depleted of pdcd <dig> was 30% lower compared with cells with normal level of pdcd <dig> . we did not measure the rate of synthesis of sarcoplasmic proteins; nevertheless, our data showing a suppression of phenylalanine incorporation into total and myofibrillar proteins suggest that even if depletion of pdcd <dig> increased the synthesis of sarcoplasmic proteins, such an increase was likely too small to offset the decrease in myofibrillar protein synthesis. it is not clear how pdcd <dig> depletion would regulate eif4g abundance and interaction with eif4e, although there is evidence that pdcd <dig> can transcriptionally regulate the abundance of some proteins  <cit> . however, there is no evidence that eif4g is one of such proteins.

combined with data from myoblasts and non muscle cells, our data suggest that the effect of pdcd <dig> on protein synthesis may depend on cell type and/or stage of development, as previously suggested  <cit> . in this regard, although pdcd <dig> has been implicated in regulating the abundance of some proteins, including p <dig>   <cit>  and lysyl oxidase  <cit> , only c-myb  <cit> , procaspase- <dig>  <cit>  and p <dig>  <cit>  have been demonstrated as natural mrna translation substrates of pdcd <dig>  these are all factors involved in regulating cell proliferation and migration, and therefore of more relevance in proliferating cells. this is consistent with the notion that the effect of pdcd <dig> on mrna translation and protein synthesis might depend on the physiological state of the cell. however, pdcd <dig> and its targets may still be relevant in regulating muscle protein synthesis and mass during muscle development and regeneration. for example during muscle hypertrophy or repair following injury, satellite cells need to be activated, leading to the proliferation of myoblasts that will subsequently fuse to form myotubes  <cit> . these can then fuse with existing myofibers or be used to form new fibers  <cit> . pdcd <dig> might be involved in this regulation. consistent with this, abundance of pdcd <dig> increases during initiation of l <dig> differentiation into myotubes .

CONCLUSIONS
we showed that in l <dig> myotubes, the regulation of pdcd <dig> abundance by nutritional factors is sensitive to mtorc <dig> and ubiquitin dependent proteolytic system. in the absence of growth factors, amino acids, including leucine, appear to play a minor role in regulating pdcd <dig> abundance. unlike in proliferating myoblasts and non muscle cells, depletion of pdcd <dig> had, at best, only modest effect on myotube protein synthesis, indicating that the effect of pdcd <dig> in muscle cells is dependent on the physiological state of the cell. additional studies are needed to dissect the mechanisms behind these differential effects of pdcd <dig>
