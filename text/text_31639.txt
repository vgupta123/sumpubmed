BACKGROUND
the macromolecule peptidoglycan  is a component of the bacterial cell wall that participates in withstanding osmotic pressure, maintaining the cell shape and anchoring other cell envelope components  <cit>  pg is composed of linear glycan strands cross-linked by short peptides, with glycan strands of alternating n-acetylglucosamine  and n-acetylmuramic acid  residues linked by β-1→ <dig> bonds  <cit> . pg is at the basis of the first classification of bacteria using the staining procedure developed by hans christian joachim gram in  <dig>  <cit> . this method reveals the presence of pg, with blue-colored gram-positive bacteria having a thick pg layer, red-colored gram-negative bacteria having a thin pg layer and poorly stained bacteria lacking pg. however, gram staining lacks sensitivity and specificity for the detection of pg: for example, mycobacterium organisms show variable results with gram staining, despite the fact that they do have pg  <cit> . in addition, pg-less planctomycetes and chlamydia bacteria stain red like gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . further exploration of pg using electron microscopy observation of the cell wall refined previous optic microscopy observations, and biochemical analyses further allowed analyzing the cell wall pg composition, contributing to the description of additional gram-positive species  <cit> .

pg biosynthesis is a dynamic complex process involving  <dig> enzymatic reactions, including the formation of glcnac-murnac dimers by a glycosyltransferase  of family gt <dig>  and the polymerization of the dimers to form the linear glycan strands by family gt <dig> glycosyltransferase  <cit> . these two glycosyltransferase families were the only ones evolved in the pg synthesis. furthermore, pg lysis involves enzymes that may belong to six different glycoside hydrolase  families, gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig>  indeed, gh <dig> and gh <dig> families include enzymes called lysozyme known to lyse the pg. gh <dig> family enzymes showed a similar folding as gh <dig> and gh <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> families showed similar catalytic activities. so, we supposed that the six ghs could be isofunctional. therefore, to be able to synthesize and to degrade pg, an organism needs a minimal set of three genes, comprising one gt <dig> gene, one gt <dig> gene and at least one gene of the five gh families mentioned above.

to circumvent the limitations associated with the aforementioned morphological and biochemical approaches to assess the presence of pg in living organisms, we aimed to develop a post-genomic, neutral approach to depict its presence among sequenced representatives of the four domains of life  <cit>  by screening the carbohydrate-active enzymes database   <cit>  for the presence of the minimal set of three genes.

RESULTS
whereas none of the  <dig> tested viruses and none of the  <dig> tested archaea genomes exhibited the 3-gene set , some representatives encode one or two genes of this 3-gene set. indeed, the pseudomonas phage jg <dig> and burkholderia ambifaria phage bcep f <dig> genomes encode one gh <dig> gene each. for archaea, the methanosaetaconcilii gp- <dig> genome contained one gh <dig>  and the methanothermobacter marburgensis str. marburg, methanobacterium sp. al- <dig>  methanothermus fervidus dsm  <dig> and methanopyrus kandleri av <dig> genomes encode one gt <dig> gene. among  <dig> tested eukaryota, only the micromonas sp. genome encodes gt <dig>  gt <dig> and gh <dig> . a total of  <dig> other photosynthetic eukaryotic genomes do not contain the complete 3-gene set but do encode a portion of these genes: the ostreococcus lucimarinus cce <dig> and oryza sativa japonica group nuclear genomes encode one and four gt <dig> genes, respectively; and the arabidopsis thaliana nuclear and chloroplastic genomes encode a total of four gt <dig> genes. the paulinella chromatophora chromatophore genome encodes one gt <dig> and one gt <dig> gene. three non-photosynthetic eukaryota genomes encode one gh <dig> gene, i.e. cryptococcus bacillisporus wm <dig>  cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans and homo sapiens. by analyzing the presence of at least one gene of the 3-gene set in  <dig> eukaryota genomes, we found that these genes were significantly more present in the photosynthetic eukaryota genomes  than in the non-photosynthetic eukaryota genomes  . comparing the presence of each gene family between bacteria and the other domains of life yielded a significant association between bacteria and the presence of gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gt <dig>  and gh <dig> . the 3-gene set was found in  <dig> / <dig>   bacteria, whereas  <dig>  bacteria appeared to lack at least one of these three genes . a review of the literature indicated that all bacteria possessing the 3-gene set have been previously demonstrated to have pg, resulting in a 100% positive predictive value of the 3-gene set for the presence of pg in an organism. for 30/ <dig>  organisms lacking the 3-gene set, pg information was lacking in the literature, whereas a literature review confirmed the absence of pg in 84/ <dig>  and the presence of pg in 24/ <dig>  organisms . these data yielded a  <dig> % negative predictive value of the 3-gene set for the presence of pg . 

the corresponding percentage of the genome explored is indicated in parentheses.

the pearson correlation test indicated a significant correlation between the absence of any gene of the 3-gene set and the absence of pg, with the highest correlation value  for gt <dig> , as confirmed by the principal component analysis . 

the phylogenetic comparative analysis yielded  <dig> clusters . two of the clusters aggregated the loss of pg with some pg metabolism genes: one involved pg loss and gt <dig> loss, with a pagel’s score of  <dig>  a percentage of error close to zero and five positive dates  and another cluster involved pg loss, the loss of gt <dig> and gh <dig> genes, with a pagel’s score of  <dig>  a percentage of error close to zero and four positive dates . 

pagel’s score was based on a chi <dig> test, with four freedom degrees and was applied to two events. functional pg corresponds to the presence of pg in the cell wall. date correspond to a node for which events were observed. *detail of dates is given in the additional file  <dig> 

based on the gt <dig> criterion, 5/ <dig>  organisms  bacteria lacking gt <dig> were distributed into 13/ <dig>  bacteria phyla, including tenericutes , chlamydia , planctomycetes , verrucomicrobia , synergistetes , fibrobacteres/acidobacteria , thermotogae , chloroflexi , cyanobacteria , proteobacteria , spirochaetes , firmicutes , actinobacteria  and thermobaculum terrenum . among the three phyla incorporating only gt51-less bacteria, planctomycetes and chlamydia were closely related, and they belong to the same superphylum pvc as verrucomicrobia, together comprising 75% of gt51-less organisms. the apparent absence of gt <dig> gene was confirmed by exploring each genome using basic local alignment search tool  analysis  <cit> . the gt <dig> gene gain/loss events analysis indicated eight loss events and only one gain event. among proteobacteria, one loss event involved orientia tsutsugamusti stc. ikeda , and the wolbacteria, ehrlichia and anaplasma branches  . in other phyla, loss event was observed for thermobaculum terrenum atcc baa  <dig> , prochlorococcus marinus str. natl1a and prochlorococcus marinus str. natl2a , ruminococcus torques l2- <dig> , the node joining of dehalococcoides organisms , the node before ternericutes and the node joining the verrucomicrobia, chlamydia and planctomycetes phyla . the only one gt <dig> gene gain event was observed for akkermansia muciniphila atcc baa  <dig>  . 

the gain/loss phylogenetic trees are available on the ioda website  <cit> .

the multivariable analysis of life style, genome size, gc content and absence or presence of pg indicated that a gc content <50%, genome size < <dig>  mb and an obligate intracellular life style were significantly correlated with the absence of pg, with odds ratios of  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  and confidence intervals of 3– <dig> ,  <dig> - <dig>  and  <dig> - <dig> , respectively . examples of such gt51-negative, pg-less obligate intracellular bacteria include chlamydia <cit> , anaplasma, ehrlichia, neorickettsia and orientia <cit> .

discussion
in this study, mining the cazy database allowed the detection of a minimal set of three genes involved in pg synthesis among the four different domains of life. the fact that this complete 3-gene set was not detected in archaea and viruses organisms is in agreement with the previously known absence of pg in these organisms and validated our method  <cit> . in archae, family gt <dig> genes are only very distantly related to the bona fide bacterial gts involved in pg synthesis, and it is possible that the archaeal gt <dig> enzymes have a function unrelated to pg. in viruses, detecting a few genes potentially involved in the synthesis and in the degradation of pg was not surprising: such viruses were indeed bacterial phages in which gh genes could have recombined with the bacterial host genome  <cit>  and could be used to break through the peptidoglycan layer to penetrate their bacterial hosts.

more surprising was the observation that the eukaryote micromonas sp. encodes a complete 3-gene set. micromonas sp. is a photosynthetic picoplanktonic green alga containing chloroplasts   <cit> . a significant association was observed between photosynthetic eukaryotes and the presence of genes involved in pg metabolism. chloroplasts are thought to descend from photosynthetic cyanobacteria ancestors, and their presence in photosynthetic eukaryotes is thought to result from eukaryotes-cyanobacteria symbiosis  <cit> . moreover, pg has been detected in the cell wall of glaucophytes chloroplasts  <cit> . we, therefore, interpreted the presence of a complete 3-gene set in micromonas sp. as deriving from its chloroplast and the presence of some pg metabolism genes in other photosynthetic eukaryotes as remnants of an ancient complete set. additionally, the eukaryote gt <dig> gene could be a remote homolog involved in plant-specific glycolipid biosynthesis and not pg metabolism. in this scenario, eukaryotes ancestors did not encode genes for pg biosynthesis, some photosynthetic eukaryotes further acquired such a capacity after eukaryotes-cyanobacteria symbiosis  <dig> - <dig>  billion years ago , and lateral genetic transfer occurred between eukaryotes and chloroplasts  <cit> . gh <dig> is also encoded by free non-photosynthetic eukaryotes; in eukaryotes, gh <dig> could act as antimicrobial molecule  <cit> . accordingly, we found that the minimal 3-gene set was specific for bacteria, with a 100% positive predictive value for the presence of pg. its predictive negative value was low, but we further determined that a lack of gt <dig> in the genome had a predictive negative value of 100% for the lack of pg in an organism. moreover, our phylogenetic comparative analysis correlated the gt <dig> gene history and the pg history. indeed, we observed that among the clusters including pg losses, gt <dig> gene losses were involved with a good pagel’s score  . these results show that pg function is strongly linked to the presence of the gt <dig> gene. thus, the gt <dig> gene could be used to predict the capacity of an organism to produce pg in its cell wall. 

a lack of gt <dig> was found in <10% of bacterial organisms. under a parsimony hypothesis, this observation suggests that bacteria ancestral genomes encoded gt <dig> and that the lack of gt <dig> gene in some bacteria results from loss events. surprisingly, such loss events are observed in almost 2/ <dig> bacteria phyla, indicating that several independent loss events occurred during the evolutionary history of these different bacteria phyla. these scenarios were confirmed by the gain/loss analysis featuring a gt51-containing bacteria ancestor and eight gt <dig> losses. moreover, we noticed that gt <dig> loss occurred in only few strains of the same species, as observed for prochlorococcus marinus. our careful examination of genomes did not find gt <dig> gene fragment, validating gt <dig> loss events which are on-going. a loss event could be counterbalanced by gt <dig> acquisition, as observed in akkermansia muciniphila of the verrucomicrobia phylum. a. muciniphila is living within intestinal microbiome a large microbial community where several lateral gene transfers have been reported  <cit> . gt <dig> gain/loss is a dynamic process dependent on selection pressure due to a pg advantage/disadvantage balance.

pg supports some important functions of the bacterial cell, preserving cell integrity by withstanding turgor pressure and maintaining a defined yet flexible shape. pg also anchors other cell envelope components and intimately participates in cell growth and cell division processes  <cit> . nevertheless, pg is also an achilles’ heel for bacteria, as some environmental organisms produce molecules that inhibit pg synthesis. the mold penicillium notatum was shown by alexander fleming to produce penicillin, a pg synthesis inhibitor and the first antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections in humans  <cit> . vancomycin is another pg synthesis inhibitor produced by the soil bacterium streptomyces orientalis <cit> . however, pg is found in the vast majority of bacteria, including bacterial organisms living in the same niches as antibiotic-producing organisms. accordingly, we observed that the absence of pg correlates with the intracellular life style and genome reduction  <cit> . in addition, free-living pg-less bacteria and archaea organisms use various osmoadapation strategies, such as the intracellular accumulation of inorganic ions, salt-tolerant enzymes or the accumulation of selected negative or neutral organic molecules  <cit>  to maintain cell shape despite the absence of pg. archaea cell walls could also contain other polymers, such as pseudomurein, methanochondroitin, heterosaccharide and glutaminylglycan, participating in the mechanical strength of the cell wall  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the exploration of pg in bacteria shows great heterogeneity in pg content. genome analysis with ancestral reconstructions and phylogenetic comparative analyses offer a neutral tool to explore this heterogeneity and trace the evolutionary history of pg. these analyses also allowed the identification of genes that could be used to predict functional features.
