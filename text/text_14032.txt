BACKGROUND
damaged skeletal muscle tissue retains the capacity to self-repair through activation, expansion and fusion of resident satellite, progenitor cells  <cit> . however, the signaling mechanisms required to trigger satellite cell activation remain unclear in this context. emerging pathways involved in the injury-response profile of skeletal muscle include notch  <cit> , akt/foxo  <cit>  and nfκb  <cit> , which appear to play distinct roles in regeneration, hypertrophy and atrophy. although these signaling pathways are well established, there remains a dearth of molecular detail, including the transcriptional consequence of atrophic stimuli, and this aspect forms the focus of the current study.

we hypothesized that subtle variance in gene expression may underlie significant functional events within the cell. consistently, previous studies have addressed the transcriptional profile of recovering muscle tissue following acute injury  <cit> . however, such studies rely on the analysis of individual genes, which is limiting from both statistical and biological perspectives. here, we performed a study with the tenet that mechanistic data may be more readily revealed in the context of pathway-related gene clustering  <cit> . we employed gene set enrichment analysis , a bioinformatics approach conceived to exploit functional regulation at the pathway level. the study focused on the dynamic expression profile of acutely stressed skeletal muscle cells, and the resultant data revealed major transcriptional adjustments in a wide range of functional categories. these findings may underscore a coordinated pathway-centric response, and reveal rational strategies for target discovery in atrophic muscle diseases.

RESULTS
in the present study, we exposed c2c <dig> skeletal myotubes to heat shock-induced damage in order to identify coordinate patterns of transcriptional regulation. to initially authenticate this cell-based injury model, we identified several stress-related biomarkers and regulatory patterns to confirm bona fide damage response in the cells. following heat shock treatment, cells recovered in growth medium at 37°c, and gene expression profiles were generated at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours post-treatment. atf <dig> and c-jun are critically regulated in the neuronal response to damage and during degeneration. furthermore, these genes may play an anti-apoptotic role in the survival response of neuronal cells  <cit> . here, both atf <dig> and c-jun transcript levels were upregulated in response to heat-shock, consistent with their reported coordinate role in cell damage response . a transient peak in expression of both genes occurred at  <dig> hours and attenuated at  <dig> h post-damage induction, indicating a regulated damage-induced response. vimentin, an intermediate filament protein that plays a role in wound healing  <cit>  and response to thermal stress  <cit> , was augmented immediately following heat shock, and peaked at  <dig> hours. this rapid response to cell stress was consistent with the role of vimentin in protection against cytotoxic effects . also, the membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteases mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  which are functional partners during skeletal development  <cit>  and stress response in the context of vascular injury  <cit> , were robustly co-regulated at the transcriptional level in response to heat shock of c2c <dig> skeletal myotubes. their expression level rose within 2– <dig> hours of insult, followed by a repression of expression levels at  <dig> and  <dig> hours .

atrogin- <dig> is expressed specifically in skeletal and cardiac muscle, and has been shown to regulate muscle atrophy  <cit> . in response to heat shock, atrogin- <dig>  was upregulated after  <dig> hours, and this level of expression was maintained for at least  <dig> hours . this dynamic profile is consistent with previous reports of muscle injury response, whereby the expression of atrogin- <dig> was concomitant with atrophy and recovery  <cit> . atrogin- <dig> is regulated by foxo transcription factors, via nuclear localization of foxo in response to various stimuli that inhibit pi3k/akt signaling and subsequently drive atrophy  <cit> .

transient profiles of gene expression
of the approximately  <dig>  probes arrayed on the gene chips, the most variable and dynamically regulated were characterized by basic clustering methodology . the most actively regulated group of genes immediately following treatment  unsurprisingly comprised a number of heat-shock proteins. hsp1a, hsp1b and hsp <dig> were among the most significantly upregulated transcripts at this time point . gene sets that clustered at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours following heat shock are displayed in figure  <dig> and are partially represented in table  <dig>  the  <dig> hour gene set was the largest group that displayed a significant upregulation, and is likely comprised of genes that were regulated downstream of immediate early genes. therefore, this cluster may represent an important set of genes that functionally dictate the coordinated response of myogenic cells to stress or injury.

gene set enrichment analysis
we employed a the gene set enrichment analysis strategy  <cit>  to cluster functionally related genes in order to consider shifts in pathway activity. individual gene sets were mined from various publicly and privately available data sources, and methodologies for the curation of functional pathways varied between sources. in all, a total of  <dig> gene sets made up the collection that was employed in this study, and the approach was employed to facilitate potential mechanistic insight to the myogenic cell response to injury  <cit> . as a control, we looked at the gene set for stress response at the  <dig> hour time point . this probe set was significantly upregulated , relative to the basal expression distribution . furthermore, a subsidence in the stress response could be observed between  <dig> and  <dig> hours post-heat shock treatment as the gene set underwent a significant downregulation  that may reflect a normalization of the cell's condition . these data clearly demonstrate the statistical strength of pathway analysis in the context of the heat shock response.

to gain better insight into the dynamic nature of regulated functional pathways, we traced the expression pattern of specific gene sets within the time course, such as the extracellular matrix protein-mediated signaling  . the analysis revealed a pattern of regulation that reflected an initial increase in pathway activity at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours, followed by a time-dependent decrease in expression through  <dig> and  <dig> hours post treatment. therefore, the overall response in the emp-m pathway to heat shock reflected an augmentation immediately following treatment, followed by a subsidence and eventual decrease in functional pathway expression after  <dig> hours. the transient nature of the pathway response was clearly defined with this bioinformatics approach, and is presented in figure 4f.

a similar analysis was carried out on the bmp signaling pathway . when traced as a function of time over the  <dig> hour period, the bmp signaling pathway was initially decreased at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours at the transcriptional level, and recovered through  <dig> and  <dig> hours post treatment . this result was consistent with the established role of bmp signaling in antagonizing myogenic specification during development, and in regenerating adult muscle tissue  <cit> . furthermore, along with the stress response pathway and the emp-m pathway expression traces, it appears that much of the initial response to heat shock was reversed within  <dig> hours of recovery.

analysis of the most active gene sets through the entirety of the time-course revealed a notable phenomenon, typified by the dynamic profile of the protein biosynthesis pathway gene set. in response to heat shock treatment, the genes in this pathway underwent a significant and immediate upregulation, which gradually declined over the next  <dig> hours . the trend for this particular functional pathway suggested that protein turnover was highly regulated in the response to heat shock-induced stress, and this hypothesis was further supported by the apparent upregulation of several related pathways involved in the expression and degradation of proteins.

after  <dig> hours recovery from heat shock, a selection of gene sets related to core gene expression machinery and protein turnover, were significantly upregulated . this general increase in protein metabolism pathways as an immediate response to injury may reflect the clearance and replacement  of the protein complement of the cell.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
this study was conducted to explore changes in gene expression following acute injury of c2c <dig> myotubes, and to reveal regulation of pathways during initial recovery.  <dig> individual transcripts represented on the microarray varied more than  <dig> fold over the course of the study, and the data revealed significant transcriptional changes in a wide variety of functional classes following heat shock damage to the cells. we devised the current study with two distinct dimensions. firstly, to trace the time-course of recovery over a  <dig> hour period, and secondly, to analyze in a pathway-centric manner in order to extract hypotheses of coordinated molecular mechanisms that occur during cellular stress and recovery. two notable pathways significantly modulated during recovery were the bmp signaling pathway, and the extracellular matrix-protein mediated signaling pathway, both of which are known to function in myogenesis, either by directing lineage specification  or structural/regenerative signaling . additionally, the muscle-specific e <dig> ligase gene, atrogin- <dig> was upregulated significantly, consistent with its reported role in mediating muscle atrophy in response to catabolic signals  <cit> , and this in turn was coincident with our observation of nuclear translocation of foxo3a following heat shock  <cit> . this reconstruction of a well documented atrophic pathway served to validate the heat shock treatment paradigm as a useful model of acute muscle stress.

the experimental approach carried out in this study demonstrated the value of characterizing cellular responses in a temporal fashion, as transcriptional regulation was commonly found to be non-static between contiguous time points within the first  <dig> hours of treatment, and often presented transient regulation that required a time-course dimension to clarify.

a notable trend that emerged from the data was an apparent increase in protein turnover apparatus-related gene sets. the most significantly upregulated gene sets included those for both transcriptional activity, translational activity and protein modification, as well as the proteolysis and proteosome pathways. this suggests that a primary response of skeletal myotubes to heat shock treatment is to renew the protein complement of the cell, presumably as a defense mechanism against proteomic damage, and potential aberrant consequences in the function or integrity of the cell. the data also show that much of this response is transient, and appears to normalize within  <dig> hours of the acute insult at the transcriptional level.

in summary, the data presented in this report demonstrate a dynamic resolution of gene expression in response to acute stress that implicates waves of pathway activity in the cell's metabolic recovery. further validation of these data are required, however, in order to demonstrate clearly the practical nature of these pathways as part of the functional stress response profile.
