BACKGROUND
the cell envelope of bacterial pathogens is critical for survival both in a host during infection and in the environment outside of the host. as the interface between the bacterium and the outside milieu, the cell envelope acts as a barrier protecting the cell against extracellular hazards. cell envelope structures are also intimately involved in the formation of contacts with host tissues during infection. to safeguard this important compartment, gram-negative bacteria possess an array of stress responses that sense conditions in the cell envelope and alter gene expression to ensure its integrity
 <cit> . in many bacterial pathogens, cell envelope stress responses play a multifaceted role. they provide protection against damage caused by components of the immune system, such as complement and antimicrobial peptides that target the cell envelope
 <cit> . they regulate the expression of chaperones required for proper assembly of cell envelope-associated structures, including outer membrane porins, pili, and fimbrae
 <cit> . in addition, cell envelope stress responses can sense the environment around the bacterium and regulate the expression of virulence factors in response to specific cues, ensuring that these factors are expressed at the proper time and location in the host
 <cit> . despite their importance, no cell envelope stress responses have yet been identified or implicated in pathogenesis in bordetella species.

bordetella bronchiseptica is a respiratory pathogen that is closely related to bordetella pertussis and bordetella parapertussis, the causative agents of whooping cough in humans
 <cit> . b. bronchiseptica causes a range of diseases in various mammals that can be chronic, difficult to completely eradicate, and of variable virulence
 <cit> . it is the etiological agent of atrophic rhinitis in swine, kennel cough in dogs, and snuffles in rabbits
 <cit> . documented human infections, generally traced to an animal source, have been observed in immunocompromised individuals, and can be serious, systemic infections
 <cit> .

the b. bronchiseptica, b. pertussis and b. parapertussis genomes encode a large number of putative transcription factors relative to their overall genome size
 <cit> , suggesting that these pathogens have the capacity to extensively regulate gene expression in response to environmental and physiological changes. despite this finding, only a few bordetella transcription factors have been studied in any detail
 <cit> . among the predicted transcription factors is an ortholog of the cell envelope stress response sigma factor, σe, of e. coli. in bacteria, sigma factors are the subunits of bacterial rna polymerases required for specific promoter recognition and transcription initiation
 <cit> . alternative sigma factors, like σe, are activated in response to specific stresses and rapidly reprogram gene expression by replacing the housekeeping sigma factor and directing rna polymerase to the genes in their regulons
 <cit> .

σe belongs to the rpoe-like group of extracytoplasmic function  sigma factors that have been increasingly implicated as key factors contributing to both bacterial stress responses and virulence
 <cit> . these sigma factors are widely distributed across bacterial phyla. where studied, they direct a diverse set of stress responses primarily targeted to the cell envelope
 <cit> . in e. coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, σe controls many genes whose products are required for the proper expression of outer membrane porins and lps
 <cit> . during infection, σe of s. typhimurium is required for survival and proliferation in epithelial and macrophage cell lines, and in the presence of antimicrobial peptides
 <cit> . in pseudomonas aeruginosa, the σe homologue, algu, controls the expression of the exopolysaccharide alginate and conversion to mucoidy. algu is constitutively activated in many clinical isolates from cystic fibrosis patients
 <cit> . in addition, σe is required for the viability of some bacterial species, but not others. the gene encoding σe is essential in e. coli and yersinia enterocolitica, but is dispensable in the closely related species s. typhimurium
 <cit> . these observations suggest that the functions of σe orthologs have been adapted to combat the challenges each organism faces in its particular environmental niche. by exploring the role of σe in diverse bacterial species, we can learn which aspects of this widespread regulatory pathway are universally conserved and which have diverged over the course of evolution.

here we show that the b. bronchiseptica σe ortholog, encoded by the gene sige , is an active sigma factor that mediates a cell envelope stress response. this is the first demonstration of an envelope stress-sensing system in bordetella species. using a murine infection model, we demonstrate that sige plays an important role during lethal infection in mice lacking adaptive immunity, but not in respiratory tract colonization. this finding has important implications for human disease, given the observation that b. bronchiseptica can cause serious systemic infections in immunocompromised humans
 <cit> . this study suggests that sige is a critical factor in this process, in addition to the bvgas master virulence regulatory system.

RESULTS
sige encodes an active sigma factor
the sige gene of b. bronchiseptica shares a number of conserved residues with other members of the rpoe-like sigma factors, including those in the dna-binding regions 
 <cit> . to determine if sige encodes an active sigma factor, we asked whether it could direct transcription from the σe-dependent rpohp <dig> promoter in e. coli. this promoter shares a high degree of similarity with a consensus promoter proposed for the rpoe-like sigma factors that was determined from both experimental data and predicted promoter sequences 
 <cit> . the sige gene from b. bronchiseptica strain rb <dig> was cloned into the ptrc99a expression plasmid and transformed into a derivative of e. coli mg <dig> that carries an rpohp3::lacz reporter gene fusion integrated on the chromosome
 <cit> . when sige expression was induced, lacz activity increased, indicating that sige can initiate transcription from this promoter . furthermore, we found that the gene encoding σe, rpoe, which is essential for viability in e. coli, could be deleted when sige was overexpressed .
 <cit>  are indicated above the alignment. regions  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  are responsible for promoter recognition
 <cit> .  β-galactosidase activity from the e. coli rpohp3-lacz reporter increases when b. bronchiseptica sige expression is induced from plasmid pseb <dig> in strain sea <dig> by the addition of iptg. no increase is seen upon iptg addition to the control strain, sea <dig>  containing the empty vector. the observed difference in the amount of β-galactosidase activity between the two strains in the presence of iptg is statistically significant   in vitro transcription from a supercoiled plasmid template containing the e. coli σe-dependent rpohp <dig> promoter with e. coli core rna polymerase , sige alone, eσe, and esige . in vitro transcription from a linear template containing the promoter region of b. bronchiseptica fam, with e. coli core rnap alone , or esige . arrows indicate transcripts from the rpohp <dig> and fam promoters. below, an alignment of the e. coli rpohp <dig> and b. bronchiseptica fam promoter sequences and a sequence logo showing the consensus promoter for rpoe-like  sigma factors from staron et al.
 <cit> .

to provide additional evidence that sige is a functional sigma factor, n-terminally his-tagged sige was purified and tested for its ability to initiate transcription in vitro from the e. coli rpohp <dig> promoter. holoenzyme formed with sige and e. coli core rna polymerase  was able to direct transcription and produced a transcript of equivalent length to that generated by e. coli eσe . the region immediately upstream of the b. bronchiseptica rpoh homologue, encoded by the fam gene, contains a sequence that is similar to the proposed σe-dependent consensus promoter, suggesting that b. bronchiseptica rpoh is regulated by sige. indeed, sige was able to direct transcription from the putative fam promoter region in vitro . taken together, these results demonstrate that sige is a functional sigma factor and can initiate transcription from promoter sequences similar to those utilized by other members of the rpoe-like sigma factor family.

sige contributes to the b. bronchiseptica stress response
to investigate the role of sige in b. bronchiseptica, an in-frame deletion of the sige gene was constructed in rb <dig>  that removed  <dig> out of  <dig> codons of the gene, leaving  <dig> and  <dig> codons at the 5´ and 3´ ends of the gene, respectively. the deletion was confirmed by pcr and southern blotting methods . σe orthologs are essential in some bacteria, including e. coli and y. enterocolitica <cit> , yet are not required for viability in many other species, such as s. typhimurium, p. aeruginosa, and burkholderia pseudomallei <cit> . deletions of b. bronchiseptica sige were readily obtained, suggesting that it falls in the latter class, and is not essential for viability. furthermore, rb50Δsige grew at a rate similar to that of rb <dig> under standard growth conditions  .

to investigate whether sige mediates a cell envelope stress response in b. bronchiseptica, we used disk diffusion assays to compare the sensitivity of rb <dig> and rb50Δsige to several chemicals that compromise cell envelope integrity and a series of antibiotics that block different steps in peptidoglycan synthesis. the sige mutant was more sensitive than the wild-type strain to the detergent sds in combination with edta . the sige mutant was also more sensitive than wild-type rb <dig> to the antibiotics mecillinam and ampicillin , whereas sensitivity to meropenem, aztreonam, and imipenem was not affected . unlike σe orthologs in other bacteria, sige was not required for resistance to the cationic antimicrobial peptide polymyxin b, which targets bacterial membranes, or to osmotic stress 
 <cit> . rb50Δsige and rb <dig> were also equally sensitive to antibiotics that inhibit cytoplasmic processes such as translation , transcription , and cytoplasmic enzymes such as dna gyrase , and dihydrofolate reductase  . this lack of sensitivity to multiple antibiotics suggests that the sige mutation does not lead to an overall increase in the permeability of the outer membrane, which would allow more of the antibiotic to enter the cell. these results show that sige is important for survival in response to specific types of damage to the cell envelope, such as disruption of cellular membranes caused by sds/edta and interference with synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer caused by ampicillin and mecillinam.

we next asked if sige is important for survival following a shift to high temperature, which perturbs both the cell envelope and cytoplasm. rb <dig> and rb50Δsige were grown at 37°c to an od <dig> of  <dig> , then shifted to 50°c, a lethal temperature for b. bronchiseptica. cell viability, assessed by cfu/ml, was measured after the shift to 50°c. survival of the rb50Δsige strain was lower than that of rb <dig> . in attempting to complement this phenotype, we found that plasmid-encoded sige did not restore survival during heat shock , although it did complement other phenotypes, as described below. similar variability in complementation of a σe mutant by a plasmid-encoded rpoe gene has been seen in other bacteria
 <cit> . work from burkholderia cenocepacia showed that expressing σe from a plasmid actually increased sensitivity to heat stress
 <cit> . in s. typhimurium, an rpoe mutant was sensitive to paraquat and did not survive in stationary phase under anaerobic conditions. expression of rpoe from a plasmid partially complemented the former phenotype, but not the latter
 <cit> . because the anti-sigma factor that regulates σe activity was not included in any of these instances, it is likely that proper regulation of sige activity is required for optimal response to particular stresses, not merely excess sige activity, complicating complementation experiments.

another aspect of the classical heat shock response is thermotolerance. when bacteria are exposed to an elevated but nonlethal temperature, heat shock responses are induced, resulting in increased production of chaperones and proteases that refold or degrade unfolded proteins
 <cit> . consequently, the cells are preloaded with protective factors and exhibit increased survival following a subsequent shift to a lethal temperature
 <cit> . to investigate the role of sige in this phenomenon, rb <dig> and rb50Δsige were grown to an od <dig> of  <dig>  at 37°c, shifted to 40°c for  <dig> min, then shifted to 50°c. rb <dig> cultures incubated at 40°c before 50°c survived better at all time points than those directly shifted from 37°c to 50°c. for example, 54% of the rb <dig> cells pre-adapted at 40°c survived two hours after the shift to 50°c  compared to  <dig> % survival for those shifted directly from 37°c to 50°c . rb50Δsige pre-adapted at 40°c also survived better at 50°c than when directly shifted from 37°c to 50°c. however, only 38% of the rb50Δsige cells survived after one hour , and 5% survived after two hours at 50°c . these results demonstrate that b. bronchiseptica exhibits a classical thermotolerance response and that sige contributes to this response.

both ethanol and heat shock lead to protein unfolding and membrane perturbation and often elicit similar stress responses
 <cit> . to test the role of sige in response to ethanol stress, rb <dig> and rb50Δsige were subcultured from mid-exponential-phase cultures into fresh stainer-scholte broth with or without 3% ethanol. both strains grew similarly in medium without ethanol, as noted above. rb <dig> grew significantly slower in medium containing 3% ethanol than in medium without ethanol , but eventually reached a cell density only slightly below that of cultures grown without ethanol. in contrast, the cell density of rb50Δsige grown in the presence of 3% ethanol never surpassed an od <dig> of around  <dig> , even after  <dig> hours. expression of plasmid-encoded sige in rb50Δsige complemented this phenotype, restoring growth in medium with 3% ethanol to nearly that of rb <dig> , indicating that sige is required for survival during ethanol stress.

σe homologues have also been found to play a role during oxidative stress in s. typhimurium and burkholderia pseudomallei <cit> . however, in disk diffusion assays, sige was not required for survival in the presence of hydrogen peroxide or paraquat, two inducers of oxidative stress . either sige is not involved in combating oxidative stress in b. bronchiseptica, or other oxidative-stress responsive pathways compensate for sige when it is absent.

growth in the murine respiratory tract is not affected by the lack of sige
b. bronchiseptica rb <dig> colonizes the respiratory tract of immunocompetent mice, causing an asymptomatic infection that is eventually cleared by the immune system. to determine whether b. bronchiseptica sige contributes to colonization and persistence in the respiratory tract, groups of c57bl/ <dig> mice were inoculated with rb <dig> or rb50Δsige. colonization was measured in the nasal cavity, trachea, and lung on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> post-inoculation. both wild-type and sige-deficient rb <dig> colonized the nasal cavity at comparable levels, peaking on day  <dig> post-inoculation, and stabilizing at about 104- <dig> cfu by  <dig> weeks post-inoculation . both strains also showed similar colonization kinetics in the lower respiratory tract of c57bl/ <dig> mice, peaking in numbers on days  <dig> and  <dig> post-inoculation in the trachea and lungs, respectively, and declining thereafter, with complete clearance in both organs by day  <dig> post-inoculation . these data indicate that b. bronchiseptica sige is not required for colonization or persistence in the murine respiratory tract.

sige contributes to lethal b. bronchiseptica infection in mice lacking b cells and t cells, but not in mice lacking tlr <dig> or tnf-α
b. bronchiseptica has been observed to cause a range of disease including bronchitis, lethal pneumonia, and even systemic infection
 <cit> . mice with defined immune deficiencies are particularly susceptible to different forms of disease
 <cit> , facilitating assessment of the roles of specific bacterial factors/functions in interactions with different aspects of the host immune response.

mice lacking key components of innate immunity, either tlr <dig> or tnf-α, were challenged with rb <dig> or rb50Δsige and signs of severe disease were monitored. consistent with published studies, tlr4def and tnf-α−/− mice inoculated with  <dig> cfu of rb <dig> quickly developed signs of lethal bordetellosis such as ruffled fur, hunched posture, decreased activity, and difficulty breathing, and succumbed  <dig> to  <dig> days post-inoculation
 <cit> . mice challenged with rb50Δsige also showed similar signs of disease and time to death . in a separate experiment, tlr4def mice and tnf-α−/− mice infected with rb <dig> or rb50Δsige that were still alive by day  <dig> post-inoculation were dissected for bacterial enumeration in the respiratory as well as systemic organs. both wild-type and sige-deficient rb <dig> colonized the lungs of tlr4def mice at 107- <dig> cfu, which was almost 1000-fold higher than in the lungs of tlr4suf mice. moreover, both strains colonized the systemic organs in tlr4def, but not tlr4suf mice . both strains also grew to higher numbers in the lungs of tnf-α−/− mice than in the lungs of c57bl/ <dig> mice and were recovered from systemic organs only in tnf-α−/− mice . these data indicate that sige is not required for b. bronchiseptica to cause lethal infection and colonize systemic organs in mice lacking tlr <dig> or tnf-α.

b and t cell-deficient rag1−/− mice succumb to b. bronchiseptica infection, and death is associated with systemic spread of the infection
 <cit> . to assess the role of sige during infection in hosts deficient in adaptive immunity, groups of rag1−/− mice were inoculated with 5 ×  <dig> cfu of rb <dig> or rb50Δsige. rag1−/− mice inoculated with rb <dig> showed symptoms of lethal bordetellosis on day  <dig> post-inoculation and succumbed between days 14– <dig> post-inoculation . however, rag1−/− mice inoculated with rb50Δsige survived without any overt signs of disease and were euthanized on day  <dig> post-inoculation. the nasal cavity, trachea, lungs, spleen, liver, and kidneys of these mice were excised to enumerate bacterial loads. although 105- <dig> cfu of rb50Δsige were recovered from the respiratory tract, this strain failed to colonize the spleen or kidney, and only  <dig> cfu were recovered from the liver . in a separate experiment, rb <dig> and rb50Δsige-inoculated rag1−/− mice were sacrificed on day  <dig> post-inoculation, when some of the rb50-challenged mice were still alive. the bacterial loads of rb <dig> and rb50Δsige in the respiratory tract on day  <dig> post-inoculation were similar, about 105- <dig> cfu. at this time, 104- <dig> cfu of rb <dig> were recovered from liver, spleen, and kidney . rb50Δsige, however, failed to colonize the spleen, kidney or liver . these results demonstrate that sige is required for lethal infection by b. bronchiseptica in rag1−/− mice.

the failure of rb50Δsige to colonize distal organs of rag1−/− mice suggests that this mutant may be defective in getting into or survival in the bloodstream and/or systemic organs. the bloodstream includes many important bactericidal factors of the host immune system, including complement and phagocytes. we first examined whether b. bronchiseptica lacking sige is more susceptible to complement-mediated killing.  <dig> cfu of rb <dig>  rb50Δsige, or rb50Δwbm, a strain lacking o-antigen, which is known to be susceptible to complement
 <cit> , were incubated at 37°c for one hour in pbs with 20% complement-active or complement-inactive serum from naïve mice. the survival of rb50Δsige and rb <dig> was not affected by the presence of either serum . in contrast, the rb50Δwbm strain was almost completely killed by complement-active, but not complement-inactive serum . the observation that rb50Δsige survived in the presence of serum without b. bronchiseptica-specific antibodies indicates that the defect in causing systemic infection in mice lacking b and t cells is not due to failure to survive the antimicrobial components in serum, including complement.

sige contributes to cytotoxicity to macrophages
we further tested whether rb50Δsige interacts differently than rb <dig> with another major bactericidal component in the bloodstream, phagocytes. b. bronchiseptica is cytotoxic to macrophages, and this toxicity has been attributed to the activities of the type three secretion system 
 <cit> . to test the role of sige in macrophage cytotoxicity, raw <dig>  murine macrophages were incubated for  <dig> hours at an moi of  <dig> with rb <dig>  rb <dig> lacking sige, or rb <dig> lacking a functional ttss . in this experiment, both the rb <dig> and rb50Δsige strains contained the empty cloning vector pev to allow direct comparisons with the complemented strain, rb50Δsige psige. cytotoxicity was determined by measuring ldh release from the treated macrophages. wd <dig> caused little cytotoxicity, similar to treatment with medium alone. rb50Δsige pev caused approximately 50% less cytotoxicity than wild-type rb <dig> pev . this defect in cytotoxicity was complemented by supplying the sige gene on the plasmid psige , indicating that loss of sige negatively impacts the ability of rb <dig> to kill macrophages.

rb50Δsige is more efficiently phagocytosed and killed by pmns
to test if rb50Δsige is more susceptible to another bactericidal mechanism, phagocytosis by peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes , rb <dig> and rb50Δsige were incubated with freshly isolated human pmns and attachment to, phagocytosis by, and killing by these cells were measured. pmns bound rb50Δsige more efficiently than rb <dig> , and significantly more rb50Δsige than rb <dig> were phagocytosed by pmns . however, the number of viable intracellular rb50Δsige was ~50% of the numbers of viable rb <dig> . when differences in attachment and phagocytosis were taken into consideration, significantly more internalized rb50Δsige were killed compared to rb <dig> . together, these data indicate that sige contributes to b. bronchiseptica resistance to phagocytosis and killing by pmns.

discussion
the bvgas system of the bordetellae plays a central role in regulating gene expression during pathogenesis
 <cit> . however, other regulators may be required during the infectious disease cycle, as bordetella genomes have a large number of putative sensory systems
 <cit> . in this study, we focused on cell envelope sensing systems and investigated the alternative sigma factor, sige. we found that sige of b. bronchiseptica does indeed mediate a protective cell envelope stress response and that strains lacking sige do not establish lethal infections in mice lacking adaptive immunity. these data suggest that the role of sige is to combat stresses to the envelope imposed by the immune system within a host and by harsh conditions in the environment outside a host. this work is the first demonstration of a cell envelope sensing system in the bordetellae. the σe system has been explored in the most depth in enteric pathogens belonging to the gammaproteobacteria
 <cit> . the bordetellae, members of the betaproteobacteria, encounter distinctly different environments in the respiratory tract and therefore provide an excellent model to study how the sige system has been adapted throughout evolution to serve the needs of diverse bacterial pathogens.

the entire sige locus  is identical at the amino acid sequence level among the classical bordetellae, suggesting a conserved role in the human pathogens b. pertussis and b. parapertussis. however, the lifestyles and, therefore, conditions encountered differ amongst these three species. b. bronchiseptica can live outside the host and primarily infects mammals, although it can infect immunocompromised humans
 <cit> . in contrast, b. pertussis and b. parapertussis primarily infect humans and are directly transmitted between hosts
 <cit> . as we learn more about the role of sige in the bordetellae, it will be of interest to determine whether stresses that induce the sige system and the sige regulon members are as highly conserved as the sige locus itself among the bordetellae.

our results define roles for sige in b. bronchiseptica that are only partially overlapping with those for σe in other pathogens. sige was important for survival of b. bronchiseptica in the face of both global stresses to the cell envelope caused by heat shock, exposure to ethanol and detergent, and specific stresses caused by several beta-lactam antibiotics . heat shock, ethanol, and detergent are classical stressors used in the laboratory to mimic conditions that lead to unfolded proteins and disrupted lipids during infection and in the environment. in contrast to the b. cenocepacia and s. typhimurium proteins, b. bronchiseptica sige was not required for survival during osmotic stress
 <cit> . sige was also not required for response to oxidative stress or the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin b, unlike the s. typhimurium σe ortholog
 <cit> . the variations among bacteria in their use of σe systems likely reflect both differences in stresses encountered in environmental reservoirs and in particular host tissues during infection, as well as differences in the arrays of additional cellular stress responses possessed by each species. these other responses can act along with or in place of σe. the presence of other stress responses may be particularly pertinent to b. bronchiseptica. its genome is predicted to encode six related ecf sigma factors of unknown function in addition to sige
 <cit>  that may have complimentary and redundant functions with sige. future studies defining conditions that activate other ecf sigma factors and their roles in b. bronchiseptica pathogenesis will provide a more comprehensive understanding of how b. bronchiseptica copes with extracytoplasmic stress.

stress response systems, like the σe system, rapidly induce the expression of specialized sets of genes. these systems are often tightly regulated and expressed only when needed, because inappropriate expression of their regulons can interfere with other important cellular functions
 <cit> . we found that sige was not required for colonization and persistence of rb <dig> within the respiratory tract of an immunocompetent host , the primary niche of b. bronchiseptica. this result suggests that the pathogen does not encounter stresses in the respiratory tract that require a response by the sige system. however, b. bronchiseptica encounters different challenges during infection in rag1−/− mice lacking b and t cells. in these mice, the infection spreads to the bloodstream, which is under greater immune surveillance and has a different arsenal of antimicrobial factors to attack invaders than the respiratory tract. the defect of rb50Δsige in lethal infection of rag1−/− mice, therefore, reveals a specific function for sige in response to an unknown stress, possibly related to the innate immune response, that the bacteria encounter during infections that proceed beyond colonization of the respiratory tract.

the inability of rb50Δsige to cause lethal infections in rag1−/− mice  could be due to failure to enter or survive in the bloodstream and/or systemic organs of these mice. since the mutation does not affect survival during incubation with serum in vitro, it is unlikely that the sige-deficient strain is more susceptible to complement or other antimicrobial components in serum. the defect in infection of rag1−/− mice may then be related to altered interactions of the mutant strain with phagocytic cells in the bloodstream. rb50Δsige is more susceptible to peripheral blood pmns than rb <dig> , and is also less cytotoxic to macrophages than rb <dig> . either or both of these defects could explain the failure to recover rb50Δsige from systemic organs of mice lacking adaptive immune responses and the decreased virulence in these mice.

why does the rb50Δsige mutant spread systemically and cause lethal infection in tlr4def and tnf-α−/− mice, but not rag1−/− mice? the lower cytotoxicity of the sige mutant and its increased sensitivity to phagocytic killing does not affect its virulence in mice lacking innate immune functions. this could be because bacterial numbers within the respiratory tract of tlr4def or tnf-α−/− mice are nearly an order of magnitude higher than in the lungs of rag1−/− mice. as such, the large number of bacteria in tlr4def or tnf-α−/− mice may overwhelm limiting host antimicrobial defense mechanisms that can contain the lower bacterial numbers in the lungs of rag1−/− mice. alternatively, although the cytotoxicity of the sige mutant is reduced, it may still be sufficient to establish lethal infections in the absence of tlr <dig> or tnf-α. thus tlr4- and tnf-α-dependent functions, such as efficient phagocytosis and killing, appear to be sufficient to prevent lethal infection by rb50Δsige in rag1−/− mice. although the exact role remains to be elucidated, our results clearly indicate that sige is required for lethal infection of mice lacking b and t cells.

although the b. bronchiseptica strain rb <dig> causes asymptomatic infections in immunocompetent mice, other strains of b. bronchiseptica can cause a wide range of disease severity in other hosts
 <cit> . in particular subsets of immunocompromised humans, such as those infected with hiv, severe systemic b. bronchiseptica infections have been observed
 <cit> . these facts, along with the high degree of sequence conservation for the sige locus in b. pertussis and b. parapertussis, highlights the importance of understanding the stressors that activate sige and how the sige system responds to them during infection.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we have demonstrated that the b. bronchiseptica extracytoplasmic function sigma factor, sige, is important for surviving global stresses that affect the whole cell, such as heat shock and ethanol stress, specific stresses that target the cell envelope, such as beta-lactam antibiotics and sds-edta, and in interactions with the host innate immune system, particularly phagocytes. during infection, sige is not required for colonization of the respiratory tract of immunocompetent mice. however, it is needed for a specific set of functions associated with virulence, particularly those involved in surviving the innate immune response when the infection progresses in immunocompromised mice. although sige systems are widely conserved, the details as to which aspects are shared and which have diverged are complex. as evidence accumulates from studies in different bacteria, it is becoming apparent that these sensory modules are important for stress survival, particularly with respect to the cell envelope. however, the nature of the stresses that sige systems combat varies. during infection, comparisons are even more difficult, since differences are seen not only amongst sige systems from one pathogen to another, but also within different niches in the host or during the progression of disease for a single pathogen.
