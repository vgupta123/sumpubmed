BACKGROUND
aspergillus species comprise strains of medical and industrial importance. only twenty out of the  <dig> species of the aspergillus genus were isolated from patients with fungal diseases. among them, a. fumigatus is the most important airborne fungal pathogen involved in various forms of aspergillosis in humans and animals  <cit> . infections caused by this opportunistic and ubiquitous fungus can lead to fatal invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised hosts with neutrophil deficiencies  <cit> . its potential virulence is still poorly understood but it is probably associated with multiple and specific fungal factors, , in combination with host factors  <cit> . recently, a. lentulus a species closely related to a. fumigatus within the fumigati section, has been described by balajee et al.  <cit> . this species has been associated with the same pathologies  <cit> . moreover, it is naturally resistant to several antifungal drugs  <cit> .

the availability of a sequenced and annoted genome of a. fumigatus provided a new starting point to understand the biology of this medically important fungus  <cit> . so far, few studies have been published about the proteomics and modification of protein expression under different environmental conditions. the techniques used are essentially based on two-dimensional electrophoresis  which allows the detection and then the purification of fungal compounds for further identification. however, even after optimization, this method is time-and sample-consuming  <cit> . more recently matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry  which associates sensitivity and efficacy, has been applied to analyze the protein composition of fungal proteome  <cit> . this methodology proved useful for unambiguous identification of aspergillus and penicillium species  <cit> . another mass spectrometry approach, the surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry  has not yet been applied to detect fungal markers. this method provides specific advantages over conventional maldi-tof approaches as it combines chromatography on plane surfaces and mass spectrometry. seldi-tof-ms is specifically useful for comparative studies of selected components. the selective protein retention on the different target surfaces of the proteinchips® arrays allows the rapid analysis of complex mixtures. since its first description  <cit> , the seldi-tof-ms method has been widely used to find specific markers in cancerous, cardiovascular, neurological and infectious diseases  <cit> . the seldi-tof technology also proved successful to allow the identification of a post translational modified form of vimentin that discriminates infiltrative and non infiltrative meningiomas  <cit> . in microbiology, seldi-tof-ms was applied on acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans  <cit>  in order to better understand the physiological responses and biological adaptation of this pathogen to environmental conditions. in parasitological research, it was also applied to study the biological disturbances and detection of diagnostic markers in african trypanosomiasis  <cit> .

the strategy of protein expression profiling allows the selection of proteins of interest or specific biomarkers and gives information on the best way to purify and further characterize them. indeed, the best suited chromatographic material and the proper elution conditions to use for purification of the proteins of interest can be predicted from the binding behavior of the protein detected on the proteinchip® arrays. this technique like maldi-tof requires a minimal amount of proteins and is really appropriate for high throughput screening, particularly to distinguish up and down regulated proteins.

the aim of the present study, after selection of the culture conditions, was to assess the reliability of seldi-tof-ms method to analyze and discriminate crude fungal extracts  of a. fumigatus and a. lentulus. it was also applied to discriminate natural abnormally pigmented mutant strains from a reference strain of a. fumigatus .

RESULTS
optimization of the seldi-tof parameters 
among the different proteinchips® tested: cm <dig>  np <dig>  h <dig>  q <dig>  imac30-zn <dig> and imac30-cu <dig>  only cm <dig>  np <dig> and h <dig> chips were suitable. binding of fungal components to the other proteinchips® was too weak to allow efficient profile analysis.

the total amount of proteins spotted on the different proteinchips® giving the best peaks resolution was  <dig> μg on cm <dig> and h <dig> surfaces and  <dig> μg on np <dig> chip. each preparation was analysed in duplicate on the proteinchips®. the spectra obtained from the culture media alone used as negative controls  did not interfere with the fungal protein spectra as the backgrounds were very low, few peaks of very low intensity were detected only under  <dig> kda .

sample storage at -20°c did not alter the protein profiles . however, as expected but never previously published to our knowledge for fungal extracts, the degradation was noticeable if the sample was stored at 4°c for seven days . as numerous fungal proteins are proteolytic enzymes, the sample preparation and the storage conditions were of great importance in comparative studies. a strictly well defined protocol for the preparation and the rapid freezing at -20°c of the extracts are essential to preserve native proteins  <cit> . due to the absence of protease inhibitors, proteolysis may occur during sample preparation. however, in the conditions used to preserve the fungal proteins, we argued that the possible degradation could be homogenous in all samples and altered slightly the comparative studies. the coefficient of variation of peak profiles on cm <dig> evaluated on three extracts from simultaneous cultures reached an average of  <dig> %, lower reproducibility was obtained on np <dig>  and on h <dig> .

selection of culture parameters: type of fractions, temperature, medium, oxygenation
in order to select the culture conditions giving an abundance of fungal components qualitatively detected on chromatographic proteinchips®, we analyzed the somatic and metabolic protein patterns on np <dig> and cm <dig> proteinchips® of the three wild-types strains of a. fumigatus  using eight culture conditions . static and shaken fungal cultures were incubated at 37°c for four days and at 25°c for seven days.

somatic and metabolic extracts
in the metabolic fractions, the total amount of proteins was at least three times as low as in the somatic fractions. thus in the secretome , specific proteins in low abundance should be undetected in the mixture of the two types of extracts  <cit> . all fungal extracts from somatic and metabolic fractions obtained from the three wild-types strains of a. fumigatus were classified into two distinct clusters, whatever the growth conditions used . as expected, this result highlights differences in protein profiles between these two types of extracts.

temperature, oxygenation and medium
we observed great variations of protein patterns under various environmental conditions with the samples from the three wild-types strains of a. fumigatus. the number of significant differences  in protein profiles according to growth conditions used were important depending on temperature. in our observations, these differences decreased with oxygenation and medium respectively.

temperature
the metabolic and somatic fractions from the three strains were separated into two distinct clusters according to growth temperature. temperature modified the protein expressions in the same way for the three strains examined. upregulated proteins were 60% higher at 37°c versus 25°c in both metabolic and somatic extracts . in our conditions, twenty proteins were shown to be overexpressed at 37°c versus 25°c from the three wild-types strains of a. fumigatus strains. protein overexpression at 37°c, also documented in our study, has already been pointed out. some overexpressed proteins have been supposed to be involved in a. fumigatus virulence  <cit> . essential genes for growth at 37°c have already been identified, and have been shown to play an important role in a. fumigatus survival and dissemination during invasive aspergillosis  <cit> .

oxygenation
on cm <dig> and np <dig> proteinchips®, two distinct clusters were obtained depending on oxygenation conditions for all the fungal samples analyzed whatever the temperature and media applied to growth conditions .

oxygen and a functional respiratory chain have been demonstrated to be essential for the germination process and mycelial development of a. fumigatus  <cit> . the protein patterns for both the metabolic and somatic fractions are notably influenced by oxygenation. from cultures with modified sabouraud medium at 37°c, we observed  <dig> significant peaks out of  <dig> between static and shaken cultures for the somatic a. fumigatus extracts and  <dig> out of  <dig> for the metabolic fractions  . aspergillus fumigatus is exposed to rapid changes in hypoxic conditions at sites of inflammation. the response to stressful conditions is likely to be an important virulence attribute of this pathogenic mold  <cit> .

medium
on modified sabouraud medium the number of upregulated proteins was higher than in the modified czapeck medium for the three wild-types strains of a. fumigatus. the medium composition obviously acts on fungal growth. the medium influence has already been shown using 2-d electrophoresis for a. fumigatus  <cit>  and maldi-tof analysis for a. oryzae  <cit> .

in conclusion, the results obtained clearly show that a. fumigatus proteome is dynamic and will adapt to its immediate environment as described for aspergillus nidulans  <cit>  and bacteria  <cit> . the three strains of a. fumigatus responded in the same way according to the variations of environmental factors such as temperature, medium and oxygenation. for comparative analysis applied to discriminate strains and species, the modified sabouraud medium and incubation temperature at 37°c were selected.

comparison of atypical pigmented a. fumigatus strains versus a wild reference strain
fewer fungal proteins were retained on h <dig> proteinchips®. as pigmented structures and fungal surface layer consist mainly of hydrophobic proteins  <cit> , h <dig> proteinchip® was chosen in association with cm <dig> to compare the profiles obtained from one reference wild-type strain of a. fumigatus  and four abnormally pigmented strains: three white strains  and one brown strain . fungal extracts were obtained from three sets of cultures started simultaneously and one set started another day. these cultures were performed on modified sabouraud medium at 37°c. since pigments are produced during conidia formation , we maintained the two oxygenation conditions allowing the analysis of proteins from hyphae and conidia  and from hyphae .

a previous study on these strains  <cit>  has shown that for two of the three white mutants investigated, the alb <dig> gene involved early in the melanin synthesis steps has mutated. for the brown mutant, a point mutation in the arp <dig> gene involved in a later step of the melanin synthesis has been observed. these three strains presented white or brown powdery colonies. for the strain ihem  <dig>  we observed poor conidiation and velvety colonies.

as previously observed with the three wild-type strains, the software classified 100% of the metabolic and somatic samples into two clusters in function of oxygenation conditions with the two types of proteinchips® used .

furthermore, the seldi-tof-ms analysis of metabolic extracts obtained from static cultures performed on cm <dig> and on h <dig> proteinchips® resulted in the classification of the five a. fumigatus strains  in five clusters. figure  <dig> illustrates the discrimination of the metabolic fractions obtained in static culture from the five strains on cm <dig> proteinchip®. using this proteinchip® with the five strains under study, eighteen proteins obtained from the metabolic fractions  and thirteen from the somatic extracts  expressed differently . some of them were specifically found in the extracts from the wild-type strain in the metabolic and in somatic fractions. on h <dig> surfaces, only twelve proteins expressed in significantly different ways in the  <dig> types of extracts.

an example of differentially expressed proteins found is illustrated in figures 4a and 4b with the cm <dig> proteinchips®. a protein with a molecular mass of around  <dig> da was detected in the somatic extracts from the wild-type strain with both proteinchips® used  but not in the extracts obtained from the four abnormally pigmented a. fumigatus strains . on the contrary, a protein with a molecular mass of around  <dig> da was found to be secreted by all four mutants in metabolic fractions from static cultures where pigment and conidia were developed  but was not detected in metabolic fractions obtained from the wild-type strain as shown in figure 4b. its relation to pigmentation or induction or repression of other genes remains to be established.

the seldi-tof comparison of these four natural mutants with the wild-type reference strain is powerful. this analysis indicated protein masses of interest which could open further investigations in the comparative study between mutants and wild-type strains. as observed, this method is highly suitable to separate low molecular weight compounds and could provide complementary data to other analytical techniques  <cit> . thus, as described for bacteria  <cit> , this method may be also suitable to discriminate isolates within the same species.

comparison of a. fumigatus and a. lentulus extracts
in addition to the separation of strains within the same species, we applied hierarchical clustering to differentiate a. fumigatus from a. lentulus, a closely related species from the fumigati section, using cm <dig> and np <dig> proteinchips® chosen for to their good reproducibility. metabolic extracts  from a. fumigatus and a. lentulus strains were classified into distinct clusters on cm <dig>  as well as on np <dig> proteinchips® . ten out of  <dig> proteins showed over expression only in the a. fumigatus extracts . somatic extracts from the two aspergillus species were also separated into two distinct clusters according to the species. however, the somatic extracts from the two a. lentulus strains were not completely separated . the best resolution was obtained with the metabolic samples on cm <dig> proteinchip®, perfect distinction was obtained between the two species and between the two isolates within the same species .

even if these two species are morphologically very similar, it has been shown that they display differences in their cell wall composition, i.e. a. lentulus contains less chitin than a. fumigatus  <cit> , is less thermotolerant and produced different secondary metabolites. the conidium surface is smooth and lack hydrophobic rodlet layer. these biochemical and structural differences could explain a distinguishable protein pattern.

CONCLUSIONS
the qualitative and quantitative results provided by seldi-tof-ms can be obtained in a rapid, sensitive and reproducible way if careful and standardized procedures are used for sample preparation and storage. the spectra obtained on cm <dig> chip essentially are protein signatures representative of the strains and of their physiological states. the proteomic analysis allows the distinction of not only the closely related species a. fumigatus and a. lentulus but also natural mutants within the a. fumigatus species. furthermore, it could be an analytical tool in the research of molecular mechanisms involved in the physiopathology of a. fumigatus. it could be also a powerful method for quality control of antigenic extracts for diagnosis purposes.
