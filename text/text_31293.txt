BACKGROUND
several genera of soil bacteria can enter into nitrogen-fixing symbioses with leguminous plants. these genera, commonly referred to as the 'rhizobia', include sinorhizobium, rhizobium, bradyrhizobium, and azorhizobium. formation of specialized, microaerophilic nodules on the roots of the host plant are elicited by the bacteria. following infection and colonization of the nodule tissue, the bacteria undergo differentiation into a mature state known as the bacteroid, which can reduce atmospheric dinitrogen to ammonia. bacteroid metabolism is dominated by the production of fixed nitrogen, which is transferred directly to the host plant. this energetically expensive reaction, catalyzed by the nitrogenase complex, is fuelled by the host plant by provision of fixed carbon, generally in the form of c4-dicarboxylates such as malate and succinate  <cit> . most of the carbon supplied by the plant is used to fuel nitrogen fixation, however, under certain circumstances, some of the carbon appears to be diverted by the bacteroid into the production of intracellular carbon storage polymers such as poly-3-hydroxybutyrate . this is a characteristic of bacteroids found in determinate nodules but not of indeterminate nodules . within the bacteroid, phb deposits can be visualized as defined, electron-transparent granules located within the cytoplasm  <cit> .

s. meliloti forms indeterminate nodules on the roots of its host plant alfalfa . these nodules are characterized by the existence of a persistent apical meristem and an elongated morphology. within the nodule, the bacteroids persist and progress through defined zones of bacteroid differentiation  <cit> . indeed, loss of phb granules from the cytoplasm of the bacteria invading indeterminate nodules is a well-documented phenomenon that occurs at a specific point within bacteroid development  <cit> .

bacteroids of indeterminate nodules undergo such large physiological and metabolic changes relative to those of determinate nodules  <cit>  that, until recently, it was unclear whether mature bacteroids within indeterminate nodules retained the capacity to synthesize and store phb. a recent study  <cit>  clearly demonstrated that bacteroids of r. leguminosarum bv. viciae, which forms indeterminate nodules on pea plants, retain the capacity to synthesize and store large quantities of phb but only when carbon supply is in excess and bacteroid metabolism is limited by the availability of a key nutrient . during saprophytic growth, phb accumulation occurs during periods of nutrient deprivation when carbon is in excess. this strategy is employed by many species of bacteria. the first step in phb degradation is catalyzed by a substrate-specific depolymerase. phb undergoes a transition from an amorphous granule in the intracellular state to a denatured semi-crystalline form upon release into the environment. as a result, different phb depolymerases are employed depending on the nature of the substrate. while extracellular depolymerases have been identified and characterized in a wide variety of bacteria, very little is yet known about their intracellular counterparts. to date, only a handful of intracellular phb depolymerases have been reported in the literature, most of which appear to lack the typical lipase box motif  associated with extracellular phb depolymerases  <cit> . while the enzymes responsible for the synthesis and storage of phb have been characterized in a wide variety of bacteria, including the rhizobia , only a few studies have investigated the role of intracellular phb depolymerases and, to date, no studies have reported the characterization of a rhizobial phb depolymerase.

here we report the cloning and characterization of phaz from s. meliloti after its identification as the putative intracellular phb depolymerase based on in silico analyses of the genome sequence and comparisons to other intracellular phb depolymerase sequences. this work is the first report of a phb depolymerase mutant in s. meliloti and, indeed, in the rhizobia. this work also represents the final step in genetic characterization of the complete phb cycle in these bacteria, as all other enzymes of both the synthetic and degradative pathways have been previously studied  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, this work also documents the first confirmed example of the presence of intracellular phb granules in n2-fixing bacteroids of s. meliloti.

RESULTS
identification of the s. meliloti phaz open reading frame and construction of an s. meliloti phaz mutant
the phaz gene was identified as a  <dig> bp open reading frame smc <dig> in the s. meliloti genome sequence  <cit>  by comparison to phaz of cupriavidus necator  <cit> . the amino acid sequences of these two proteins share 51% identity. interestingly, like phaz of c. necator, the phaz protein of s. meliloti does not possess a gly-x-ser-x-gly lipase box motif  <cit>  that is characteristic of many extracellular phb depolymerases. the absence of this motif implies that these intracellular phaz homologues may use a different active site structure to extracellular phb depolymerases. primers were designed to internal regions of phaz to amplify a fragment  by pcr, and the resultant  <dig> bp fragment was cloned into pgem®-t easy  to generate paz <dig>  an internal disruption of the cloned phaz fragment was generated by introducing a Ωsmsp cassette as a cfr <dig> fragment into the unique kpni site at  <dig> bp to yield paz <dig>  the phaz::Ωsmsp was subsequently excised as an ecori fragment and subcloned into pk19mobsacb to give paz <dig>  paz <dig> was introduced into s. meliloti rm <dig> by triparental mating using e. coli mt <dig> as a helper strain. single recombinants were identified by selecting for rfr, smr, spr transconjugants. putative double recombinants were identified by plating onto ty sm sp sucrose . subsequent screening for loss of vector-encoded nmr confirmed the loss of pk19mobsacb. the resultant rfr, smr, spr, nmsphaz mutant was designated rm <dig>  the mutagenesis was confirmed by southern blot using the phaz pcr product as a probe. the probe hybridized to a  <dig>  kb ecori fragment of genomic dna in the wild-type strain rm <dig>  and to a  <dig>  kb fragment in rm <dig>  confirming the presence of the  <dig> kb Ωsmsp cassette . this mutation was transduced into rm <dig> using the ϕm <dig> phage by standard techniques  <cit>  and the resultant mutant was designated rm <dig> 

cloning of phaz gene for complementation assays
primers smc02770f 5'-cctaagcttatgttctaccagctttacgagatgaac-3' and smc02770r 5'-cgaaagcttttagtgatggtgatggtgatgggccgacttgccgcccttg-3' were designed to the 5' and 3' regions of smc <dig>  incorporating hindiii sites into the 5' and 3' ends as well as a 3' terminal his tag. the pcr product was cloned as a hindiii fragment into prk <dig> and the resultant construct was named pma <dig>  this construct was introduced into rm <dig> by triparental conjugation using mt <dig> as the mobilizer strain.

growth phenotype of rm <dig> and ability to survive long-term carbon starvation
mutants of phac, phab, and bdha all demonstrate impaired growth on phb cycle intermediates  <cit> . to determine if a lesion in phaz resulted in a similar impairment in the capacity of s. meliloti to utilize phb cycle intermediates, the growth of rm <dig> was compared to that of rm <dig>  rm <dig>  <cit> , rm <dig>  <cit>  and rm <dig>  <cit>  on ty, yma, and minimal media containing either  <dig> mm acetate , acetoacetate  or d-3-hydroxybutyrate  as sole carbon sources. no difference in growth phenotype was observed between rm <dig> and rm <dig> .

the ability of the phaz mutant strain to withstand long-term carbon starvation was tested, relative to both rm <dig> and rm <dig>  by incubation for  <dig> weeks in m <dig> liquid medium with no added carbon source. cells were grown to late-log in ymb and washed twice in m <dig>  a 1: <dig> dilution was used to inoculate  <dig> ml of m <dig> salts. starting cfu/ml was determined immediately following inoculation by serial dilution of a  <dig> ml aliquot. starting cultures typically contained approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu/ml. these starting values were each given a relative value of  <dig>   <dig> ml samples were removed at  <dig> day intervals and serial dilutions were used to determine cfu/ml. values presented are the averages of  <dig> independent cultures. the data in figure.  <dig> show that the ability to synthesize and/or break down phb has a significant impact on long-term survival in the absence of an exogenous carbon source. the wild-type strain rm <dig> is capable of increasing cell density during the early stages of starvation, presumably by degrading readily mobilizable intracellular carbon stores, a pattern which is not seen in either the phaz or phac mutants.

phb accumulation
to assess the effect of the phaz lesion on phb content in rm <dig>  total phb accumulation of stationary-phase cells was measured and compared to the wild-type strain rm <dig>  cells were grown to stationary phase in either ymb and the accumulated phb was measured as a total cellular dry weight . these data are shown in table  <dig> and represent the average from three samples. rm <dig> demonstrates significantly increased phb accumulation relative to rm <dig> suggesting that, while synthesis of phb is not impaired, the lesion in phaz inhibits degradation of phb. the phb accumulation phenotype of rm <dig> is complemented by pma <dig>  demonstrating a clear relationship between the presence of phaz and phb accumulation.

effect on expression of succinoglycan synthesis genes
the product of the exof gene is involved in the transfer of the first sugar, galactose, to the lipid carrier, upon which the subunits of succinoglycan are assembled  <cit> . pd82exof::tnphoa was constructed by homologous recombination between exof carried on pd <dig>  <cit>  and the chromosomal exof::tnphoa fusion of strain rm <dig>  <cit> . the resultant plasmid was used to measure the transcriptional activity of exof in different s. meliloti phb mutant backgrounds when grown under different culture conditions. a student's t-test was used to analyze the data and determine statistical significance of the observed differences. the results presented in table  <dig> represent the mean of three independent samples. when analyzed using a two-tailed student's t-test, the  <dig> -fold increase in exof expression exhibited by ymb-grown rm <dig> is statistically significant. furthermore, the non-mucoid mutants rm <dig> and rm <dig> exhibit a reduction in exof expression. this is consistent with the observation that colonies formed by rm <dig> appear larger and more mucoid on yma than rm <dig> or rm <dig> .

a these differences are statistically significant from the value recorded for rm <dig>  when analysed using a two-tailed student's t-test

symbiotic phenotype of rm <dig> and bacteroid phb accumulation
unlike bacteroids of determinate nodules, bacteroids of s. meliloti do not accumulate phb during symbiosis . interestingly, a mutant of r. leguminosarum unable to cycle amino acids between the bacteroid and plants, showed apparent accumulation of phb in the bacteroid within pea indeterminate nodules  <cit> . this suggests that the pathway for phb metabolism can function within bacteroids of indeterminate nodules; however accumulation of phb only occurs under extreme circumstances for example, when carbon is in excess and bacteroid metabolism is limited by the availability of a key nutrient. to confirm that s. meliloti bacteroids are capable of phb synthesis and accumulation, alfalfa nodules induced by rm <dig> were prepared, sectioned and analyzed by tem. figure  <dig> clearly shows that bacteroids of rm <dig> accumulate phb during symbiosis, with numerous, electron-transparent, phb granules visible within the cytoplasm of the bacteroids when viewed by tem. this is in contrast to bacteroids of rm <dig>  shown in figure  <dig>  which demonstrate a notable absence of phb.

symbiotic assays with the host plant alfalfa revealed no significant difference between the phaz mutant rm <dig> and the wild-type strain rm <dig>  plants inoculated with rm <dig> had an average shoot dry mass  of  <dig>  mg compared to  <dig>  mg for plants inoculated with rm <dig>  both of which were significantly different to the uninoculated controls, which had an average sdm of  <dig>  mg. this is interesting since it suggests that phb accumulation, as confirmed in figure  <dig>  does not occur at the expense of symbiotic effectiveness.

competitiveness for nodule occupancy of rm11430
the ability of s. meliloti rm <dig> to compete for nodule occupancy was assayed by co-inoculating alfalfa plants with different strain combinations. table  <dig> shows that, when co-inoculated in approximately equal ratios with the wild-type strain, rm <dig> demonstrated no discernible difference in competitiveness relative to rm <dig>  the percentage of rm <dig> in the original inoculum was similar to the percentage of nodules that it occupied. in agreement with previous studies  <cit> , both rm <dig>  and rm <dig>  demonstrated significantly reduced competitiveness relative to wild-type. table  <dig> also shows that both rm <dig> and rm <dig> demonstrate reduced competitiveness relative to rm <dig>  with the phac phenotype being more pronounced than the bdha phenotype.

the role of eps in the establishment of nitrogen-fixing symbioses between s. meliloti and m. sativa has long been acknowledged  <cit> , but the precise mechanism of interaction remains elusive. mutants unable to synthesize eps are characteristically fix-. the observation that phac and phab mutants of s. meliloti are still able to establish successful symbioses  <cit>  suggests that synthesis of succinoglycan in these mutants, albeit at a reduced level, is still sufficient to facilitate nodulation. this is consistent with previous reports which suggest that the production of small amounts of low-molecular-weight  eps is sufficient to establish a successful symbiosis  <cit> . indeed, it is conceivable that the competition defect observed in phac mutants of s. meliloti may be due to extremely low levels of succinoglycan production. the phac mutant may produce sufficient succinoglycan to establish an effective symbiosis but, assuming that the succinoglycan itself is playing a role in signalling during early nodulation, not enough to allow it to compete with strains producing higher levels of the eps. interestingly, the phaz mutant demonstrates wild-type competitiveness and is able to out-compete both the phac and bdha mutants for nodulation. it is conceivable that another metabolic pathway that is dependent on d-3-hb metabolism may play a role in nodulation competitiveness. it is noteworthy that, although it has higher succinoglycan production than rm <dig>  the phaz mutant was not more competitive than the wild-type strain. while it is tempting to speculate that there may be a critical level of succinoglycan, above which, further gains in competitiveness are not seen, further information regarding the synthesis of succinoglycan during the infection process is still needed. studies are currently underway in our lab to investigate this possibility further.

it is conceivable that, when phb synthesis is inhibited, intermediates required for succinoglycan are not synthesized efficiently. it is also possible that, in the absence of a functional phb synthesis pathway, enzymes required for succinoglycan may be inhibited or down-regulated. furthermore, it has been suggested that acetyl phosphate may provide a regulatory link between phb and succinoglycan synthesis  <cit> . studies in the thermophilic cyanobacterium synechococcus sp. strain ma <dig>  have shown that acetyl phosphate is involved in the post-translational regulation of phb synthase in vitro, and that this regulation is concentration-dependent  <cit> . as well, that study revealed that the enzyme phosphotransacetylase, which converts acetyl-coa to acetyl phosphate, is only active under phb-accumulating conditions  <cit> . in e. coli, acetyl phosphate is known to act as a global signal which acts through two-component regulatory signals  <cit> , perhaps by direct phosphorylation of the response regulator  <cit>  itself. furthermore, the chvi protein, of the s. meliloti exos-chvi two-component regulatory system, is able to autophosphorylate in the presence of acetyl phosphate in vitro  <cit> . since phb synthesis mutants may excrete excess acetyl-coa, levels of acetyl phosphate will likely be low under these conditions. therefore, intracellular levels of acetyl phosphate may be an important factor in the exos-chvi-dependent regulation of succinoglycan synthesis.

CONCLUSIONS
previous studies have demonstrated that the ability of certain bacteria to synthesize, accumulate and metabolize intracellular phb stores is important in enhancing their capacity to survive unfavourable growth conditions  <cit> . rhizobia in the soil environment must contend with varying nutrient conditions, from the carbon-deficient bulk soil, to the carbon-rich rhizosphere  <cit> . the ability to accumulate and utilize carbon stores would be highly advantageous, allowing rhizobia to cope with fluctuating carbon conditions, and thus, make them more competitive against other bacterial populations  <cit> . previous studies have shown that mutant strains of s. meliloti unable to synthesize  or degrade  phb show a significant reduction in competitiveness for nodule occupancy  <cit> , with mutants that are unable to synthesize phb exhibiting a much greater loss in competitiveness than those unable to degrade phb  <cit> , as we have confirmed here.

this is the first study in which the competitiveness of an s. meliloti phaz mutant has been investigated. it was expected, based upon the phenotype of the bdha mutant  <cit> , that the phaz mutant would exhibit reduced nodulation competitiveness. interestingly, the phaz mutant was as competitive as wild-type in co-inoculation experiments, and consistently out-competed both phac and bdha mutants . studies in azotobacter vinelandii have demonstrated a role for phb in protection of the cell against environmental stresses including ph, oxidative stress and uv damage  <cit> . it is conceivable that the enhanced competitiveness of the phaz mutant, relative to the phac and bdha mutants, is due to an enhanced ability to tolerate the conditions encountered in the soil and rhizosphere as a result of the increased cytoplasmic phb concentration.

interestingly, the phaz mutant shows a similar reduction in long-term survival during starvation to the phac mutant . this suggests that the inability to degrade phb is just as detrimental to the cells as the inability to accumulate it. this also confirms that phb degradation does play a significant role in fuelling cellular metabolism under adverse conditions, and that glycogen synthesis and degradation is not able to replace the function of phb metabolism under these conditions.

previous studies have shown that s. meliloti mutants defective in phb synthesis also exhibit a significant reduction in succinoglycan production under conditions favouring both succinoglycan and phb production  <cit> , suggesting that these pathways share a common regulatory factor. s. meliloti phab and phac mutants exhibit non-mucoid colony morphology on carbon-rich media, while bdha mutants show a mucoid colony morphology. this study further augments these observations by showing that a phaz mutant is not only mucoid, but has up-regulated exopolysaccharide production relative to the wild-type strain.

bacteroids of determinate nodules, in contrast to those found in indeterminate nodules, can accumulate up to 50% of their cellular dry mass as phb . the synthesis of phb during symbiosis however, presumably occurs at the expense of symbiotic nitrogen fixation; a theory that is corroborated by the observation that a phac mutant of r. etli demonstrates higher levels of nitrogenase activity relative to wild-type  <cit> . bacteroids of indeterminate nodules do not accumulate phb during symbiosis. it has been suggested  <cit>  that this may be one of the reasons why the s. meliloti-alfalfa symbiosis is more effective than that of b. japonicum-soybean or r. etli-bean  <cit> . interestingly the data presented in this paper suggest that forced accumulation of phb by s. meliloti during symbiosis does not appear to have a negative effect on plant yield, suggesting that phb synthesis during symbiosis is not the only determinant of symbiotic performance.
