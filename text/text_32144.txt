BACKGROUND
anopheles stephensi is a major malaria vector in the indian subcontinent  <cit> . rapid urbanization and development in the region has stimulated a corresponding increase in their population resulting in frequent malaria outbreaks  <cit> . although, recent malaria epidemics occurred at higher frequencies, mortality was considerably low. for example during  <dig>  of the reported  <dig>  million cases, only  <dig> deaths were recorded in india  <cit> .

absence of an efficient vaccine  <cit> , evolution of drug-resistance in the parasites  <cit> , and insecticide-resistance in the mosquitoes  <cit>  accentuate the need of an effective malaria control strategy. human immunization against parasite proteins through transmission blocking vaccines   <cit>  is one such strategy. bacterial and fungal-based mosquito control methods are other alternatives but these suffer from major difficulties in practical application  <cit> . transgenic mosquitoes could provide another control method  <cit> , but successful application in field will require designing of appropriate vector-parasite study model  <cit> . ito et al.  <cit> , showed transgenic expression of an antiparasitic peptide sm <dig> in mosquitoes leading to impairment in plasmodium berghei development. however, the peptide failed to show such activity against plasmodium falciparum  <cit> , the human malaria parasite. study of naturally occurring p. falciparum-resistant a. gambiae mosquitoes revealed a plasmodium-responsive gene, anopheles plasmodium-responsive leucine-rich repeat  <dig>   <cit> , which could form a potent target for the transgenic approach against p. falciparum. many other antiparasitic and/or immunologically active genes like srpn <dig>  <cit>  from a. gambiae and a. stephensi, tep <dig>  <cit>  and leucine-rich repeat protein   <cit>  from a. gambiae have also been identified recently. moreover, availability of a. gambiae genome sequence  <cit>  has improved the chances of discovery of more such potential genes in this insect.

in the pre-genomic era, est  based studies were adopted to understand a. gambiae  <cit>  and its role in malaria transmission  <cit> . however, despite its importance as a malaria vector, a. stephensi has not been intensively investigated. although est  <cit>  and microarray-based  <cit>  studies on a. stephensi and plasmodium exist, no major transcriptome based contributions have been reported so far. here, we report the first large-scale effort in construction and analysis of est libraries from midgut tissue of sugar-fed  and p. yoelii infected blood-fed   female a. stephensi. in light of limited genomic and transcriptomic information for a. stephensi, these data would significantly enrich the molecular aspects of this insect and its role in malaria transmission.

RESULTS
generation of ests and pre-processing
two cdna libraries, sf and bf were prepared from sugar-fed and p. yoelii infected blood-fed  adult female a. stephensi mosquito midgut tissues, respectively. single-pass sequencing yielded  <dig> ests from both, sf  and bf  libraries as analyzed by phred  <cit>   with minimum length greater than  <dig> bases. vector, adapter, and primer sequences were removed using cross_match  <cit> . mouse and plasmodium sequences were filtered using stand-alone blast. average length of ests from both the libraries was approximately  <dig> bases and approximately 61% of the sequences were above  <dig> nucleotides. table  <dig> shows the summary of est data obtained in this study. all the ests are deposited in genbank with continuous accession numbers .

†a high quality sequence is obtained by phred using quality value ≥  <dig> for a stretch  <dig> bases. ‡obtained on assembling ests from sf and bf libraries. § uts are calculated as sum of number of contigs and singlets. ¤obtained using all the ests together. $calculated using contigs obtained in common assembly of ests from both the libraries.

est assembly
cap <dig>  <cit>  based est assembly and clustering of the combined dataset  resulted in  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singlets, forming  <dig> unique transcripts . similarly, independent assemblies were also performed for sf and bf libraries. details are given in table  <dig> 

assignment of putative functions to ests and uts
to assign putative function to ests and uts, we performed blastx search against the uniprotkb database. summary of blastx results for sf, bf, and combined uts are shown in table  <dig>  blastx results for combined uts are given in additional file  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows blast hit distribution across various species of organisms for all uts from the combined dataset. putative functions were assigned only to  <dig> ests  and  <dig> uts  . non-coding est sequences usually fail to find a homolog in the protein databases during blastx search  <cit> . we therefore, screened unannotated  uts  for the presence of putative coding region using estscan program  <cit> .  <dig> uts were predicted to contain a coding region, thereby suggesting these as novel genes. the remaining sequences could be potential untranslated regions . table  <dig> shows estscan results of both the libraries and combined dataset.

₤uts with no significant hit in uniprotkb database .

a. stephensi uts were also compared with the est sequences of a. gambiae, aedes aegypti, and drosophila melanogaster using tblastx . as compared to ests from ae. aegypti and d. melanogaster, a higher number of uts  were homologous to a. gambiae ests. only 39% and 34% uts were identified homologous to ests from ae. aegypti and d. melanogaster, respectively .

assignment of go terms & statistical comparison
gene ontology  categories were assigned only to  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> uts from the sf, bf, and combined datasets, respectively using blast2go program  <cit> . additional file 2: figure s <dig> illustrates percent similarity and e-value distribution obtained for all the uts. table  <dig> shows percent distribution of uts among various assigned go terms  according to the go consortium  <cit>  for sf and bf libraries. details of assigned go terms to each ut from combined dataset are given in additional file  <dig>  statistical comparison of go terms between the two libraries revealed an overrepresentation of metabolic process-related genes in bf library, whereas cellular process-related house keeping genes were dominant in sf library . for details refer additional file  <dig> 

statistical comparison of gene expression
ideg <dig> analysis  <cit>  for blastx-annotated ests identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes  between the two libraries. in brief,  <dig> genes  in sf and  <dig> genes  in bf library were found to be differentially regulated. few unannotated genes  were also found to be significantly altered in expression. two unannotated genes  and pu_contig <dig> ) were exclusively expressed in sf library, while only one such exclusive gene ) was found significantly expressed in bf library. moreover, pu_contig <dig> and pi_contig <dig> , pu_contig <dig> and pi_contig <dig>  pairs of unannotated genes were observed in both the libraries with significant changes in gene expression. many genes were also exclusive to each library but showed no statistical significance. details are given in additional file  <dig> 

identification of insect-specific transcripts
to identify insect-specific genes in our uts, we used data from zhang et al.  <cit> . only  <dig> transcripts encoding insect-specific proteins were observed in our data and most of them were related to metabolic processes such as reductases and deaminases. a few receptor proteins, sensory and immunity-related proteins were also observed .

mapping of ests on the anopheles gambiae genome
genome mapping and alignment of a. stephensi uts on a. gambiae genome revealed many homologous genes between them .  <dig> uts were successfully mapped on the a. gambiae genome, which also included  <dig> novel uts. remaining uts  failed to show any alignment with the a. gambiae genome. table  <dig> illustrates the details of mapping study.

database development
estdb , a database housing the entire est dataset along with its annotations has also been developed. the database supports text- and sequence-based queries through a user-friendly interface. it also provides graphical display of contigs along with assembled ests.

discussion
a. stephensi is a predominant malaria vector in urban parts of the indian subcontinent. in spite of its importance as a malaria vector, no in-depth transcriptomic information is available on the midgut tissue of a. stephensi during sugar feeding and parasite infection. we herein report generation, annotation, and analysis of ests from sugar-fed and p. yoelii infected adult female a. stephensi midgut tissues.

 <dig> high quality ests were obtained from the sugar-fed cdna library and  <dig> ests from the  <dig> h post blood-fed infected cdna library. with  <dig> ests, our study represents the first intensive effort in complementing gene sequence information for this mosquito. although the genome of the closely related anopheline species, a. gambiae is available, discovery of novel transcripts  in a. stephensi suggests a significant interspecies variation. in addition, mapping of novel transcripts  to the a. gambiae genome testifies the usefulness of our data in gene discovery process.

like other insects, mosquitoes are also equipped with genes responsible for adaptation to environment changes. identification of insect-specific genes could prove useful in understanding the molecular basis of their success in various ecological niches. recently, zhang et al.  <cit>  identified stress and immune-response related proteins as a major fraction of insect-specific proteins. we have identified  <dig> such insect-specific genes like reductases, deaminases, receptor proteins, sensory- and immunity-related proteins in this study.

comparative analysis of go terms demonstrated striking differences between the two stages of the vector examined. based on molecular function, gene ontologies, peptidase activity , catalytic activity , and endopeptidase activity  were found significantly upregulated in blood-fed infected condition . in biological process ontologies such as digestion , proteolysis , cellular lipid metabolic process , electron transport , and acyl-coa metabolic process  were found overrepresented upon blood feeding . we also identified many dominant and differentially expressed transcripts in the two cdna libraries indicating their prominent role in the stage specific physiological and/or biochemical processes in the mosquito vector. based on ideg <dig> analysis of est data,  <dig> blastx-annotated genes were differentially regulated upon sugar feeding and parasite infection with blood ingestion. sugar-fed condition exhibited a significant upregulation in the expression of many ribosomal proteins, mitochondrial proteins and other housekeeping genes . dominance of proteases like various isoforms of trypsin, chymotrypsin precursors, carboxypeptidases, and other proteases  characterized the blood-fed infected female mosquitoes as reported earlier  <cit> . however, some isoforms of serine proteases were also significantly overexpressed in the sugar-fed tissue. we also identified  <dig> unannotated genes , pu_contig <dig> , pu_contig <dig> , pu_contig <dig> & pi_contig <dig> , and pu_contig <dig> & pi_contig <dig> ), which were significantly altered during the two conditions. these require further characterization .

encountering antimicrobial peptides like cecropin-a precursor  and cecropin-b precursor  with a prominent dominance in sugar-fed condition is a unique observation. it is noteworthy that cecropins are the first reported antimicrobial peptides from insects  <cit> , also known to have antiparasitic activity in mosquitoes  <cit> . however, the other well known antimicrobial peptide, defensins, with characteristic six cysteine/three disulfide bridge pattern  <cit> , showed no differential expression  between the two conditions. defensins are primarily active against gram-positive bacteria and are induced by plasmodium or other microbial infections in mosquitoes  <cit> . another transcript encoding an uncharacterized immune response-related protein   was overexpressed upon sugar feeding. lysozyme c- <dig> and salivary lysozyme  transcripts were also expressed in the sugar-fed tissue . these molecules participate in innate immunity  <cit>  by catalyzing hydrolysis of the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell wall.

blood feeding causes excess protein and iron overload in mosquitoes  <cit> . blood-induced expression of protease transcripts would therefore be expected  <cit> . these proteolytic enzymes not only help in protein digestion but also facilitate establishment of parasite infection through proteolytic activation of enzymes, e.g., conversion of pro-chitinase to chitinase in plasmodium gallinaceum, which digests the peritrophic matrix  <cit> . post-iron overdose caused by blood feeding also induces synthesis and secretion of iron storing molecules like ferritin, which defend mosquito cells from iron toxicity  <cit> . in our study, increased expression of putative ferritin transcripts in the blood-fed tissue, e.g., ferritin subunit  <dig> and secreted ferritin g subunit  substantiated this fact. transcripts encoding protein g <dig> precursor were exclusively  seen in the blood-fed tissue as reported earlier  <cit> . this protein shows homology with bla g <dig> and per a <dig>  allergens from cockroaches, which are shed in the insect feces and upon inhalation these cause asthma in human beings  <cit> . the other protein g <dig> counterparts, ang <dig> from a. gambiae  <cit>  and aeg <dig> from ae. aegypti  <cit>  are both induced upon blood feeding. interestingly, aeg <dig> is postulated to have a function in digestion and it maps to a genomic region affecting susceptibility to parasite infection  <cit> .

serpins are serine protease inhibitors, deriving their name from their activity  <cit> . many studies have identified different genes and isoforms of serpins in a. gambiae  <cit> . in a. gambiae, serpin  <dig>  is reported to negatively regulate ookinete killing and melanization thereby assisting midgut invasion by malaria parasites  <cit> . encountering this transcript   in blood-fed infected tissue corroborates this fact.

mosquito and plasmodium chitinases are shown to promote successful establishment of the parasite by digesting the midgut peritrophic matrix  <cit> . chitinase expression is reported to increase upon bacterial and pathogen infection  <cit> . a similar increase in chitinase expression  in the ookinete-infected tissue substantiates the fact.

as reported earlier, parasite invasion in mosquito midgut epithelia induces a cascade of changes leading to cell death by apoptosis  <cit> . in the blood-fed infected tissue, we also observed expression of apoptotic transcripts like caspase- <dig> and ancaspase- <dig>  <cit> . transcripts encoding anti-apoptotic proteins, which modulate caspase activity were found to be expressed in sugar-fed mosquito tissues, e.g., defender against programmed cell death. in blood-fed infected tissue, we also observed an increase in the number of several enzymes participating in redox metabolism and detoxification, such as superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, isoforms of metallothionein, cytochrome p <dig>  and glutathione-s-transferase . some of the oxidoreductases were found in both the libraries but an overall upregulation is evident upon blood feeding and parasite infection, as reported earlier  <cit> .

cytoskeletal remodeling in host cells is a hallmark of pathogen attachment and invasion during infection  <cit> . we also found many transcripts encoding cytoskeletal and its associated proteins during both the conditions. as the regulation of formation of the actin network in cell cytoskeleton is centered at arp2/ <dig> complex   <cit> , its overexpression is necessary during infection. a significant increase in arps, α and β tubulins are reported to be upregulated during parasite invasion in a. gambiae midgut  <cit> . however, we did not find such difference. pathogen establishment is a stress to the host cell  <cit>  accompanied with oxidative burst leading to misfolding of proteins  <cit> . a vast variety of stress induced proteins, especially, heat shock proteins and chaperonins are produced by the cell to carry out proper protein folding during stress. many such transcripts were also observed in our data .

tetraspanins are conserved membrane proteins traversing cell membrane four times  <cit> . these are found associated with many other proteins, especially integrins. they are involved in intracellular signaling, cellular motility, and metastasis. we found tetraspanin transcripts  in both conditions. in drosophila  <cit> , the tetraspanin family comprises more than  <dig> members suggesting a possibility of many such proteins in mosquitoes. interestingly, in manduca sexta, tetraspanin-integrin interactions have been reported necessary for transition of hemocytes during cell-mediated immune responses  <cit> .

proteins containing leucine-rich repeats  like apl <dig>  <cit> , lrim <dig>  and lrim <dig>  <cit>  demonstrate inhibitory activity against plasmodium infection in a. gambiae and anopheles quadriannulatus  <cit> . many other lrr domain containing proteins like toll receptors are reported in insects and other organisms, which primarily participate in protein-protein interactions  <cit> . they exhibit diverse functionality but a definitive role has not been established in insects. we also found a few transcripts encoding proteins with lrr domains in our study .

ichit protein contains mucin domains, which participate in the formation of extracellular matrix  <cit> , and in trapping microbial pathogens through their lectin-liking characteristics  <cit> . it possesses two putative chitin-binding domains flanking a mucin domain, and is observed to increase upon bacterial and malaria challenge in a. gambiae  <cit> . however, we observed an increase in ichit  transcripts in sugar-fed condition. this protein is also believed to be associated with the peritrophic matrix, which separates the blood meal from the midgut membrane. found across many other organisms, a possible role of ichit in immune response is predicted against pathogens  <cit> .

septins are gtpases thought to be associated with cell division especially nuclear division, membrane trafficking, and organizing the cytoskeleton  <cit> . as in other studies  <cit> , we also observed septins and smt <dig> transcripts in the sugar-fed tissue. these together play a role in toll signaling  <cit> . we found many other insignificantly expressed transcripts in both the conditions , which might bear an indispensable role in mosquito life cycle, e.g., vitellogenin, which is an abundant yolk precursor protein participating in egg maturation  <cit> .

in summary, our study identifies numerous transcripts from a. stephensi midgut tissue with known and unknown functions . however, despite of massive sequencing, loss of rare transcripts is possible. this could be due to the overexpression of certain stage specific genes, e.g., blood-induced genes like trypsin. in addition, our study differs with respect to the use of incubation temperature  for parasite development in mosquitoes from work reported earlier   <cit> . however, we observed reasonable number of oocyst formation . blood feeding by these parasite-carrying mosquitoes also induced a significant parasitemia in uninfected mice, confirming completion of parasite life cycle in the vector at 28°c. furthermore, in the view of low genomic and proteomic resemblance between p. yoelii and the human malaria parasites  <cit> , observations from rodent models like ours, need an essential analysis and assessment before extrapolation. nevertheless, the information generated in the form of transcriptome could certainly prove a boon in investigating other malaria parasites.

CONCLUSIONS
we have successfully obtained  <dig> transcripts from the adult female a. stephensi mosquito midgut, which would be of considerable use in future research on this malaria vector. mapping of transcripts onto the a. gambiae genome was beneficial in the gene discovery process.
