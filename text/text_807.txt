BACKGROUND
nematostella vectensis is a burrowing, estuarine sea anemone that has been an important model system for embryonic development in cnidaria, and was the first cnidarian to have a draft genome sequence available  <cit> . mature n. vectensis liberate gametes into the water. cleavage begins roughly two hours after fertilization, with gastrulation occurring roughly  <dig> hours post fertilization  at 18°c  <cit> . embryos develop into swimming planula larvae. after variable time in the water column ), the planulae metamorphose and settle to the benthos as young polyps.

there have been extensive studies of gene expression throughout development in n. vectensis, based largely on in situ mrna hybridization [e.g.  <cit> . these studies have provided detailed pictures of differential spatial expression, as well as qualitative assessments of changes in expression through time. in this paper, we complement these spatial expression studies with quantitative rna-seq analyses of whole embryos through time. this approach provides no spatial resolution, but allows for a temporal analysis of changes in expression across the whole embryo for previously annotated genes  <cit> . high-throughput quantitative expression studies have been conducted in a handful of other cnidarian species. previous quantitative sequencing work has focused on differential gene expression between different zootypes within a colony  <cit> , the response of developing coral larvae to temperature stress  <cit> , and the response to ocean acidification  <cit> . however, none of these studies focus on patterns in gene expression through multiple stages of development.

we sampled n. vectensis embryos at six time points through the course of development:  <dig> hpf,  <dig> hpf,  <dig> hpf,  <dig> hpf,  <dig> , and  <dig> dpf. the interval from 2– <dig> hpf captures early cleavage events through approximately  <dig> cells. 7– <dig> hpf encompases prawn chip stages i-v  <cit> . 12– <dig> hpf includes the onset of gastrulation. the  <dig> hpf -  <dig> dpf interval spans development from a gastrula to a planula. in the interval from 5– <dig> dpf the animals develop tentacle buds and settle.

each of these six time points was sampled from two replicated spawning events, giving a total of twelve samples. expression in each of the twelve samples was then quantified with rna-seq. this project design allows us to characterize broad patterns in expression through time, as well as address specific questions about transcriptional dynamics over the course of development. we focus in particular on the maternal to zygotic transition, with a brief overview of gastrulation.

RESULTS
sequencing, mapping, and consistency across replicates
on average,  <dig>  million sequence reads passed the illumina chastity filter for each sample. we deposited these reads at the ncbi sequence read archive . between 28-69% of these reads mapped to nuclear ribosomal sequences  or the mitochondrial genome, and were not considered in the statistical analysis. reads mapped to  <dig>  of the  <dig>  sequences in the reference . dispersion was low in the edger analyses , indicating low variation between the replicates even though they were from two different clutches that were spawned months apart.

the count matrix, along with results of statistical analyses and other annotations, is available as additional file  <dig>  the r code for several example analyses of this matrix are presented in additional file  <dig>  these vignettes can be used as starting points for analyses beyond those presented here, such as more detailed investigations of particular time points, genes, or genes with gene ontology  annotations of particular interest.

patterns in transcript abundance through time
to get a broad overview of changes in transcript abundance through time we performed short time-series expression miner  analysis, which categorizes each transcript according to temporal patterns of expression .  <dig>  transcripts received a stem profile.

among the top five expression profiles, are patterns of both monotonic increase and decrease, as well as peaks at  <dig> of the  <dig> intermediate time points . the most represented pattern is an increase in abundance through development , which includes transcripts involved in ribosomal function e.g. jgi transcript id:  <dig>  id:  <dig>  id: 236265), wnt-like transcripts  several possible wnt receptor frizzled-like transcripts , neurotransmitters and receptors  and transcripts with a possible relationship to muscle structure/function . a monotonic decrease in transcript abundance is also among the top five most abundant plots , and these transcripts are discussed in greater detail below . transcripts within a stem peak at or after gastrulation  include those related to laminins, which are possibly involved in gastrula epithelialization , as well as light sensing rhodopsins and opsins . the fifth most abundant profile includes transcripts that peak at  <dig> hours and decrease over time . this category includes cellular growth factors , a kruppel-like factor , and a possible ccr <dig> not transcription complex member , discussed in greater detail in the maternal to zygotic transition section.

transcripts with significant changes in abundance through time
 <dig>  of the  <dig>  reference gene sequences with mapped reads  were found to have differential gene expression  across at least one of the time intervals examined here . there are relatively fewer genes with dge between the first two time points , indicating that rates of zygotic transcription and selective mrna degradation are low in this interval. relative to this first interval, there are nearly four-fold more genes with dge between 7– <dig> hpf. most of these show an increase in transcript abundance, rather than a decrease. the number of genes with significant dge is greater still in the interval between 12– <dig> hpf, with an almost equal number of genes with increased dge  and decreased dge . the number of dge genes continues to grow between  <dig> hpf -  <dig> dpf, with slightly more genes increasing in abundance than decreasing. relative to the previous several intervals, a drop in the number of dge genes is seen in the interval between  <dig> and  <dig> dpf, and is comparable to the number and proportion of dge genes seen between 7– <dig> hpf.

gene ontology
in order to understand broad changes in functional categories of genes we performed a gene set enrichment analysis . this analysis identified those go categories that are overrepresented among genes with significant changes in expression over a given interval. the number of enriched go categories in a given interval also lends some insight into the magnitude of change occurring in that timeframe.

between 2– <dig> hpf  <dig> go categories are significantly enriched. this is the smallest number of enriched categories of any interval, reflecting the relatively small number of significant transcriptional changes that occur between these time points. many go categories in this interval involve cell cycling; this is not surprising, as early development in many organisms is often characterized by rapid, maternally-run cell divisions  <cit> . between 7– <dig> hpf  <dig> go categories are enriched. these include categories related to translation, dna binding , and axis specification. these categories reflect the onset of zygotic transcription in this interval . the largest number of enriched go categories is between 12– <dig> hpf, which comprises  <dig> categories. these include translation, intracellular processes , and processes related to membrane targeting and function. between  <dig> hpf and  <dig> dpf,  <dig> categories are enriched, including categories related to transcription factor activity. between 5– <dig> dpf a relative decrease in the number of enriched categories is observed, with only  <dig> categories. these include categories related to receptor activity, calcium binding, and muscle function, reflecting the development of neuronal and muscular features of the  <dig> day old polyps. ribosomal activity is enriched in three of the intervals: 7– <dig> hpf, 12– <dig> hpf, and 24– <dig> dpf; this reflects the increasing translational needs of the embryo after the onset of zygotic transcription, until the interval between the planula and polyp stages, where these data imply the cellular ribosomal concentration reaches steady state.

go enrichment of select transcripts that are changing in abundance during the major wave of zygotic gene expression. the go-seq rank is given for each go term, as well as the go id, and one of three possible go ontology terms, which describe either the location, function or process the transcripts may be associated with. a description of the category is listed, the go-seq p-adjusted value, the number of transcripts annotated within that category, and the relative number of transcripts whose abundance is decreasing or increasing through the interval.

maternal to zygotic transition
all sexually produced animals must pass control of the gene regulatory network from maternal factors deposited in the egg to newly synthesized gene products, synthesized after the embryo begins developing, of the zygotic genome. this transition is referred to as the maternal to zygotic transition  and has been studied in depth in mammals, insects, fish, amphibians, nematodes, and echinoderms  <cit> . research on the mzt in drosophila melanogaster and the sea urchin strongylocentrotus purpuratus has found that the transition is a combination of two phases:  the elimination of maternal rnas and  the beginning of transcription from the zygotic genome  <cit> . our data reveal key aspects of both processes in n. vectensis. first, we narrow the window of timing for embryonic transcription from the zygotic genome. second, we identify transcripts that are present at the earliest time point and then decrease in abundance, and are likely the first maternal transcripts to be degraded. other maternal transcripts may also be degraded, but the change hidden by concurrent embryonic transcription that masks the decline in maternal abundance. third, we identify transcripts that increase in abundance between early time points, which are the first genes to be transcribed from the zygotic genome. of these, we specifically focus on transcripts whose pattern of expression peaks early in development.

timing of the onset of zygotic transcription
only  <dig> transcripts show increasing abundance and dge between 2– <dig> hpf, compared to  <dig>  transcripts with increased dge over the 7– <dig> hpf interval . these results suggest that the major onset of zygotic transcription begins between 7– <dig> hpf at 18°c. go enrichment of the 7– <dig> hour time interval reflects this transition, and includes many categories related to early zygotic activity .

maternal transcript degradation
we took two approaches to identifying maternal transcripts that are degraded over time. first, we examined the transcripts with stem profile  <dig>  which have a monotonic decrease in abundance through time . next, we identified those transcripts that decrease significantly between 2– <dig> hpf, regardless of changes in abundance over later intervals.

with stem analysis we determined that  <dig> % of mapped transcripts decrease over time , representing 15% of transcripts detected in the zygote . of these  <dig>  transcripts, 82% decreased significantly between at least two time points in development . among them was a possible n. vectensis homologue of mos <dig> : 189257), which plays a role in oogenesis in the hydrozoan clytia hemisphaerica <cit> . many transcripts associated with cell totipotency also decrease throughout development  <cit> , including vasa domain containing transcripts , piwi , and tudor .

after gaining general insights into broad patterns of transcripts with decreasing expression over the course of development, we next identified transcripts that decrease significantly between 2– <dig> hpf, regardless of subsequent changes. a set of  <dig> transcripts met this criterion .

histone modification and rapid cell cycling are two proposed mechanisms by which expression of the zygotic genome is repressed in early development of bilaterians, and transcripts associated with these processes may be degraded preferentially in cnidarians as well  <cit> . several chromatin remodeling homologues decrease significantly from 2– <dig> hpf. these include a putative histone modifier brg <dig> associated factor  that has been shown to be essential for the mzt in mice,  <cit> . other putative histone modifiers include a histone methyltransferase  and a possible member of a male specific lethal-like complex   <cit> . cell cycle genes include a rootletin-like transcript , which is associated with mitosis  <cit> , and cyclin b-like transcript . maternally loaded rna of cyclin b is targeted for degradation in xenopus embryos, possibly through an mirna pathway  <cit> . the significant decrease in transcript abundance for these genes between 2– <dig> hpf suggests that maternal repression of zygotic expression in n. vectensis shares some conserved features with bilaterians, and that maternal repression is weakening in this interval.

initiation of zygotic transcription
we next examined the initiation of zygotic transcription, first by identifying transcripts whose proteins may play a functional role in the degradation of maternal rna, and second, by looking for transcripts that peak in abundance only at the  <dig> hour time point, and thus may be specific to the mzt or early embryonic development.

to isolate transcripts whose protein products may function in maternal rna degradation, we examined transcripts that increase significantly either between 2– <dig> or 7– <dig> hpf. a smaug homolog  is present at low abundance in the zygote, and increases significantly at  <dig> hpf. in d. melanogaster smg is a transcriptional regulator that binds to maternal transcripts, targeting them for degradation  <cit> . after d. melanogaster smg binds to specific rna sequences, it recruits the ccr4/pop2/not-deadenylase complex, which removes the poly tail, thus signaling the rna for degradation  <cit> . two possible members of the ccr4/not transcription complex are significantly upregulated between 2– <dig> hpf  and a third between 7– <dig> hpf . which ccr4/not transcription complex smg may be recruiting, if any, remains to be determined. however, these data suggest that the smg ccr4/not transcription complex pathway for degradation of maternal rnas may be present in cnidarians.

we next examined genes that appear to be expressed only at the  <dig> hour time point, and may be involved in the mzt, or early embryonic development. we isolated this subset by selecting for only those transcripts that exhibit significant changes in expression before and after  <dig> hpf, and that also have a stem profile of  <dig> .  <dig> genes met these criteria. this subset represents some of the earliest genes to be transcribed by the zygotic genome that are also specific to the blastula stage.

five genes whose homologues are known to interact in other organisms, which function in body plan formation and neuronal development, were among these  <dig> transcripts. these include an achaete-scute homologue , also known as nvashb, which functions in proneural patterning in other organisms  <cit> . in n. vectensis, the spatial and temporal expression of this transcript was studied. expression was first detected via in situ hybridization in the blastula at the oral pole, with less staining in the early gastrula, and loss of staining by mid-gastrula  <cit> , these results agree with our findings. in d. melanogaster and humans, achaete-scute is laterally inhibited by hairy and a hairy-related protein hes- <dig>  respectively  <cit> . a n. vectensis homologue of hairy  also shows increasing expression exclusively in the 7– <dig> hpf interval. a lim class homeodomain transcription factor  known in d. melanogaster as chip, which interacts with achaete-scute in proneural prepattern and thorax development  <cit> , is also upregulated only at  <dig> hpf. lastly, we identified two wnt genes in this subset , both similar to wnt <dig> in other organisms. wnt <dig> is among the earliest zygotically-expressed regulatory factor in the sea urchin, where it is responsible for patterning along the animal-vegetal axis  <cit> . wnt8b expression in humans and mice is restricted to early brain development  <cit> , and in the spider achaearanea tepidariorum, wnt <dig> knockdowns affect expression of hairy, among others transcripts, and decrease formation of posterior body regions  <cit> . while multiple n. vectensis wnts have been studied with in situ hybridization, including one wnt <dig> <cit>  , the transcripts we identify have not been examined. the wnt <dig> transcripts we observe at this time point are strongly expressed at  <dig> hpf, with one ) being expressed almost exclusively at this time , and another ) displaying low level expression before and after  <dig> hpf.

wnt <dig>  hairy, chip, and achaete-scute are known to interact in other organisms, and play a role in both body plan patterning and nervous system development. in n. vectensis it is possible that they play a role in one or both of these processes. examining the spatial expression of more of these genes, as well as conducting functional studies, would further shed light on this hypothesis.

the onset of gastrulation
we chose to sample gastrula at several hours past the initiation of gastrulation  <cit> , in an attempt to capture early gastrula gene expression. n. vectensis gastrulation occurs via invagination  <cit> , and the formation of a blastopore was clearly visible in some embryos.

of the  <dig>  transcripts that increase between 12– <dig> hpf,  <dig> have a significant expression peak only at  <dig> hpf . these genes include a homologue of homeobrain , a transcription factor that is expressed in brain formation in d. melanogaster <cit>  and the annelid capitella teleta <cit> . we also identified a possible frizzled family receptor- <dig> , which is also significantly up regulated from 7– <dig> hpf, and is involved in limb and nervous system development in chicks  <cit> . these transcripts may be involved in early nervous system and apical organ formation in n. vectensis.

CONCLUSIONS
the analyses presented here provide a global perspective on significant changes in gene expression through time during n. vectensis development. we identify likely maternal transcripts targeted for degradation, and a subset of transcripts whose proteins may play a role in targeting maternal factors, as well as genes among the first to be transcribed by the n. vectensis embryos, which may play a role in neuronal development and/or patterning. we also identified the major wave of zygotic transcription, which occurs after the  <dig> cell stage between 7– <dig> hpf. the matrix file , as well as some suggested approaches for its use  will allow other investigators to examine temporal changes in transcripts of particular interest, perform additional analyses, and examine time points relevant to processes not directly addressed here. future applications of rna-seq to characterize the transcriptional dynamics of n. vectensis development will likely benefit by higher temporal resolution. the results presented here will help guide the selection of additional time points so that changes in expression can be pinpointed in time more precisely. in addition, an updated set of transcript predictions will be essential for more detailed analyses. the gene predictions provided by the n. vectensis genome project have been an invaluable resource to the community, and enabled many projects . there are several properties of the gene predictions generated for this project that limit their utility for use in conjunction with new tools, such as rna-seq, that were not available at the time the genome annotations were produced. in particular, the presence of rrna in a large number of gene predictions and the absence of multiple known genes limit the analyses that can be done with these sequences. an updated set of gene annotations and transcript predictions, which will surely benefit from the much deeper transcriptome sequencing that is now possible, will be a critical goal for further work with high-throughput tools for the study of n. vectensis development and functional genomics.
