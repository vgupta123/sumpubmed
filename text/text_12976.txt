BACKGROUND
climate change may introduce several environmental challenges for farmed fish caged in seawater pens. in temperate areas, increased seawater temperature during the summer months may represent a problem for farmed fish unable to swim to colder water. ectothermic animals such as fish normally show temperature-dependent oxygen consumption  <cit> . increasing temperatures may induce low oxygen stress since oxygen solubility is reduced in warmer water. fish may also experience hypoxia at elevated temperatures even under conditions with unchanged oxygen tension, for example increased temperature could reduce the binding capacity of hemoglobin for oxygen transport  <cit> . environmental temperature affects almost all aspects of fish physiology, and effects of temperature fluctuation on teleosts have been studied extensively for decades  <cit> . sedentary fish species may be exposed to stressful short-term temperature spikes during the summer months when ambient seawater temperature changes rapidly. metabolism in ectothermic fish is highly dependent on environmental temperature  <cit> , with suboptimal conditions affecting both feed intake and growth  <cit> . for instance, sea-caged atlantic salmon , unable to escape sudden temperature bursts by vertical migration, may experience considerable challenges with temperature adaptation. in southern norwegian fjords such temperature periods lasting a few weeks have been recorded in recent years with observed temperatures above optimal levels for locally farmed atlantic salmon  <cit> , raising both fish welfare and productivity challenges.

numerous studies have profiled global gene expression changes in fishes exposed to elevated temperature and hypoxia. both acute and chronic heat stress can induce relative large transcriptional changes in salmonids  <cit>  and other fish species , including in cold-adapted antarctic fish  <cit> . also hypothermia can induce transcriptional changes in fishes  <cit> . depending on studied cell type, typical responses in fish exposed to heat stress include altered transcription in genes involved in protein processing, transcription and cell growth  <cit> , protein folding and heat shock proteins  <cit> , cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and proteolytic protein degradation  <cit> , β-oxidation of fatty acids and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor genes  <cit> , acute inflammatory response  <cit> , and ribosomal genes and catabolism, i.e. metabolism  <cit> . although oxidative stress response has been reported as one of the strongest affected mechanisms in fish exposed to acute temperature stress according to global genome screening  <cit> , surprisingly few of these studies have reported large transcriptional changes in genes associated with the antioxidative defense.

as for temperature, hypoxia may have profound effect on biochemical, molecular and physiological processes in fish  <cit> . consequences of low dissolved oxygen are often sublethal and affect growth, immune responses and reproduction  <cit> . for atlantic salmon, oxygen levels falling below the critical point of 6 mg/l are considering hypoxic  <cit> . in one of the first microarray screening studies with fish, gracey et al.  <cit>  showed profound effects of hypoxia on the longjawed mudsucker  after 5 days of treatment. they observed effects on transcripts encoding proteins involved in protein synthesis and locomotion, as well as on genes needed for anaerobic atp production. studying gene expression changes in zebrafish  embryos exposed to 24 hours of hypoxia during development, ton et al.  <cit>  identified transcriptional changes indicating metabolic depression with a switch from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism and energy preservation. more recent studies have shown changes in expression of genes related to physiological adaptation to low environmental oxygen in gills of zebrafish after 21 days of hypoxia exposure  <cit> , effects on general metabolism, catabolism, and ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in brain, gill and liver of japanese medaka  after 5-6 days of exposure to hypoxia  <cit> , responses in genes involved in metabolic energy changes in brain, gill and liver of xiphophorus maculatus after 6 days of exposure to hypoxia  <cit> , as well as activation of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in fin tissue of japanese medaka after 7 days of exposure to hypoxia  <cit> . in gonads of zebrafish acute hypoxia for  <dig> and 14 days affected responses such as metabolism of carbohydrate and proteins, and reactive oxygen species metabolism, while chronic hypoxia affected lipid metabolism, steroid hormones, and immune responses  <cit> .

in this work we wanted to evaluate how atlantic salmon cope with environmental challenges possibly imposed by climate change by comparing the molecular responses in fish held at sub-optimal temperature and oxygen levels. recent findings suggest that thermal responses of fish can be oxygen-limited  <cit> , indicating that oxygen-limited thermal tolerance is of major importance in the response of fish to climate change  <cit> . global transcriptional responses in liver of adult atlantic salmon exposed to high temperature  and low oxygen  was examined using next-generation sequencing technology. tissue samples were obtained from two independent experiments. in the first experiment, described in detail by hevrøy et al.  <cit> , atlantic salmon was held at 13°c , 15°c, 17°c or 19°c . effects of heat stress were evaluated by comparing the transcriptional patterns in the 13°c and 19°c groups of fish using suppression subtractive hybridization  cdna libraries followed by flx  <dig> sequencing. in the second experiment, control fish were held at optimal oxygen  and low oxygen stressed fish held at sub-optimal oxygen . effects of low oxygen were evaluated by comparing the transcriptional patterns in the two groups of fish using normalized cdna libraries followed by flx  <dig> sequencing. in total we sequenced about  <dig>  million reads from four cdna libraries, and used gene ontology and pathway analysis tools to evaluate the responses. real-time rt-qpcr analysis was used on an extended number of fish for follow-up examination of relevant genes, including growth regulation and oxidative stress relevant genes.

RESULTS
temperature and low oxygen trials, growth
somatic growth of atlantic salmon, measured as thermal growth coefficient , significantly decreased with increasing exposure temperature . in salmon exposed to low dissolved oxygen saturation there was a significant reduction in tgc compared to fish kept at normal oxygen saturation levels . pair fed fish raised on normal oxygen saturation had reduced tgc compared to normal fed fish at kept at similar oxygen level, but higher growth than fish kept at low dissolved oxygen saturation . by comparing fish growth from these two studies, comparable tgc values  were observed in fish held at sub-optimal temperatures above 15°c with optimal oxygen, in pair fed fish kept at with optimal oxygen levels, and in fish exposed to low dissolved oxygen saturation.figure  <dig>

annotation and gene ontology  enrichment analysis
to search for possible impurities in the cdna pool, megan software was used. metatranscriptomic analysis showed that reads from all four cdna libraries had very few hits against microbial and human sequences, and with a vast majority of hits against sequences from teleostean species, suggesting a very low level of contamination in the cdna pools.

of the  <dig> contigs consisting of more than  <dig> reads from the forward ssh cdna library ,  <dig> % were annotated with a blastx cut-off of 10- <dig> .  <dig> % of the contigs showed no blastx hits against the genbank database. from the reverse ssh cdna library ,  <dig> % of the  <dig> contigs consisting of more than  <dig> reads were annotated with a blastx cut-off of 10- <dig> .  <dig> % of the contigs from the reverse ssh cdna library showed no blastx hits. similarity distribution showed most hits against atlantic salmon sequences. of the  <dig> contigs consisting of more than  <dig> reads from the low oxygen stress normalized cdna library ,  <dig> % were annotated with a blastx cut-off of 10- <dig>   <dig> % of the contigs showed no blastx hits against the genbank database. from the normal oxygen normalized cdna library,  <dig> % of the  <dig> contigs consisting of more than  <dig> reads were annotated with a blastx cut-off of 10- <dig> .  <dig> % of the contigs from the normal oxygen normalized cdna library showed no blastx hits. similarity distribution of the ssh cdna contigs showed most hits against atlantic salmon sequences, while similarity distribution of the normalized cdna contigs showed most hits against zebrafish sequences, closely followed by atlantic salmon sequences.

go enrichment analysis was performed by using the fisher’s exact test, as implemented in the blast2go software, to study temperature- or low oxygen- specific responses in atlantic salmon using contigs containing more than  <dig> reads. figure  <dig> shows over- or under expressed gos as determined by the fisher’s exact test . figure 2a shows enriched gos in atlantic salmon exposed to 19°c. relative few gos were differentially expressed in heat stressed fish at 19°c compared to fish kept at optimal temperature at 13°c. heat stress resulted in overexpression of gos linked to oxygen binding and transporter activity, i.e. go: <dig> oxygen binding and go: <dig> oxygen transporter activity. figure 2b shows differentially expressed gos in atlantic salmon exposed to low oxygen saturation with significance levels of p <  <dig> . many gos linked to general metabolism were significantly affected by low oxygen saturation, suggesting a compensatory response induced by low oxygen stress. top listed overexpressed gos were go: <dig> nucleic acid metabolic process, go: <dig> rna metabolic process and go: <dig> regulation of cellular metabolic process, whereas gos linked to oxygen reduction reactions such as go: <dig> oxidation-reduction process and go: <dig> oxidoreductase activity were underexpressed. all significant over- or underexpressed gos, including ids and terms, p-values, and the number of transcripts associated with a specific go term from the cdna libraries, as determined by fisher’s exact test, are shown in additional file  <dig>  from the temperature stress experiment, enriched gos are shown in the additional file  <dig>  worksheet a. form the low oxygen experiment, we list go enrichment analyses data both for contigs only consisting of more than  <dig> reads   and by using all large contigs . according to the latter analysis, gos linked to lipid metabolism were underexpressed in salmon held at low oxygen saturation, with go: <dig> lipid metabolic process and go: <dig> fatty acid metabolic process being most significant. in total, by also including contigs with less than  <dig> reads, fewer significant gos were found . the larger dataset however appears to provide more specific gos than by using only contigs consisting of > <dig> reads.figure  <dig>

a gene list consisting of  <dig> identifiers recognized by ipa from the temperature stress experiment was used for pathway analysis. the list was generated by considering all the genes in the forward ssh cdna library as being up-regulated by temperature stress and given a fold-change score of  <dig>  and all the genes in the reverse ssh cdna library as being down-regulated by temperature stress and given a fold-change score of - <dig>  ipa analysis for temperature stress genes revealed seven top networks, “protein synthesis, gene expression, cancer”  , “rna post-transcriptional modification, gene expression, protein synthesis” , “dna replication, recombination, and repair, energy production, nucleic acid metabolism” , “hematological disease, metabolic disease, nutritional disease”  , “gene expression, protein synthesis, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction” , “drug metabolism, protein synthesis, glutathione depletion in liver”  , and “free radical scavenging, lipid metabolism, molecular transport”  . top canonical pathways were “eif <dig> signaling” ), “acute phase response signaling” ), “regulation of eif <dig> and p70s6k signaling” ), “mtor signaling” ), and “mitochondrial dysfunction” ). ipa upstream regulator analytic aim to identify the cascade of upstream transcriptional regulators that can explain the observed gene expression changes in the dataset, and help illuminate the biological activities occurring in the tissues or cells being studied. ipa analysis suggested that “ <dig> -dithiol-3-thione” , “sirolimus” , “pirinixic acid” , “cd 437” , and “5-fluorouracil”  to be the top upstream regulators. additional file  <dig> shows the predicted upstream regulators of temperature stress in atlantic salmon liver with an overlap p-value higher than 10e- <dig> . ipa-tox analysis generates a focused toxicity and safety assessment of chemical compounds using toxicogenomics approaches, but can also be used to assess molecular perturbation of all kinds of environmental stressors, i.e. temperature and low oxygen. from the temperature stress experiment ipa-tox analysis listed “mitochondrial dysfunction” ), “positive acute phase response proteins” ), “lxr/rxr activation” ), “negative acute phase response proteins” ) and “lps/il- <dig> mediated inhibition of rxr function” ) as the top five most significant effects.figure  <dig>

the ipa compare function was used to find transcripts solely expressed in the low oxygen group and not in the normal oxygen group, creating a list consisting of  <dig> genes with positive ipa identifiers. according to the ipa core analysis, the top three affected networks solely expressed in the low oxygen group were “lipid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, dermatological diseases and conditions” , “nucleic acid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, organ morphology”  and “hereditary disorder, metabolic disease, cardiovascular disease” . figure  <dig> shows the second highest scored ipa core analysis network by using gene identifiers unique for the low oxygen group. this network, “nucleic acid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, organ morphology”, includes the hif1a gene in a central position, suggesting a link to hypoxia. the top canonical pathway, “protein ubiquitination pathway”, had a p-value of  <dig> e- <dig> and a ratio of 11/ <dig> . according to the ipa core analysis “ <dig> -dithiol-3-thione” , “sirolimus” , “pirinixic acid” , “cd 437”  and “5-fluorouracil”  were the top upstream regulators. additional file  <dig> lists the predicted upstream regulators of low oxygen stress in atlantic salmon liver with an overlap p-value higher than 10e- <dig> . activation z-scores from the low oxygen experiment were not possible to calculate since we did not have any fold-change input. low oxygen exposure induced the following effects according to the ipa-tox analysis, “glutathione depletion - phase ii reactions” ), “hypoxia-inducible factor signaling” ), cholesterol biosynthesis ), cytochrome p <dig> panel - substrate is a xenobiotic  ) and mitochondrial dysfunction ).figure  <dig>

to compare the degree of overlap in response to temperature and low oxygen stress and how these stressors differentially affect atlantic salmon, the data were analyzed with the venny tool  <cit> . only  <dig> transcripts, listed in table  <dig>  were common for the two different stressors . in general, both treatments appear to have affected overall transcription and metabolism.table  <dig>

correlation analyses of the individual rt-qpcr transcript data from the temperature and low oxygen stress experiments are shown in additional file  <dig>  from the temperature stress experiment, many of the evaluated target gene transcripts were strongly correlated with each other . for example, the transcriptional level of hif1a in these individuals was positively correlated with cuzn sod, mn sod, gr, gpx <dig>  mtor, cyp1a, ndufs <dig> and psmc <dig> . many of the transcripts encoding oxidative stress markers were strongly correlated in fish exposed to heat stress.

to compare correlations of transcripts from the low oxygen exposure experiment, we combined the control normoxia fish from the high and low energy feeding groups , and the low oxygen-exposed fish from the two dietary groups , to search for altered correlations in fish kept at suboptimal oxygen saturation for 120 days . hif1a transcription was positively correlated to cuzn sod and psmc <dig> transcription in the low oxygen-exposed fish, but not in the control fish . for most of the evaluated oxidative stress marker genes, low oxygen exposure induced few changed transcript correlations, except for mn sod that showed stronger correlations with ndufs <dig> and psmc <dig> in fish kept at low oxygen. ndufs <dig>  one of the genes selected from the cdna libraries as a potential marker of both temperature and low oxygen stress, was positively correlated with igfbp1a and psmc <dig> in the low oxygen-exposed fish, but not in the control fish. both hsp <dig> and hsp90a were positively correlated with igfbp1b in the low oxygen-exposed fish, but not in the control fish. cyp1a, a much-studied biomarker that easily changes expression after environmental stress, showed several low oxygen-mediated correlations, including positive correlations with cuzn sod, mn sod, cat, mtor and hsp <dig>  additional file  <dig> shows sequences in fasta format of all assembled contigs from the four cdna libraries  discussed in this work.

discussion
in this work we wanted to compare the transcriptional responses to chronic high temperature and low oxygen stress in atlantic salmon to elucidate possible negative effects on farmed atlantic salmon as a consequence of climate change. to do so we obtained samples from two independent experiments, one temperature stress experiment conducted in  <dig> and described by hevrøy et al.  <cit> , and one low oxygen stress experiment conducted in  <dig>  global transcriptional profiling data were obtained from four cdna libraries sequenced with  <dig> flx technology. ipa upstream regulator analysis aims to identify which transcriptional regulators that may be responsible for the observed change in a dataset, and was used for comparison of the two datasets. based on the suggested upstream regulators the two stressors seem to affect many transcription factors regulating similar processes in liver cells. in line with established knowledge, at the molecular level these stressors appear to affect the rate of protein synthesis and lead to a metabolic rate suppression that ultimately results in reduced growth. this study thus suggests that both temperature stress and low oxygen induce metabolic depression in atlantic salmon.

in general, many genes were significantly down-regulated in fish exposed to 19°c compared to the control fish kept at optimal condition at 13°c. this pattern was verified with the rt-qpcr analyses. fish held at 15°c or above had reduced growth compared to the controls. in ectoderms, abiotic factors such as temperature determine the amount of energy spent on maintenance and growth, as most biological processes, i.e. protein synthesis and degradation, are temperature dependent. at temperatures above optimal reduced growth is inevitable  <cit> , as recently shown in longtime elevated temperature experiments with atlantic salmon  <cit> . the current study shows that long-term exposure to sub-optimal oxygen saturation also has a negative effect on growth in atlantic salmon. the growth effects of hypoxia are often explained in terms of loss of appetite and assimilation efficiency, and in terms of digestion  <cit> . a similar loss of appetite has been shown in large atlantic salmon continuously exposed to 19°c  <cit> . at the cellular level, protein synthesis and ion-pumping through na,k-atpase represent key targets of hypoxia causing energy reallocation  <cit> . by comparing the two datasets, temperature and low oxygen stress seem to induce effects involving many similar mechanisms. however, surprisingly few of the top-ranked genes in the cdna libraries were common between the two treatments. only  <dig> contigs with similar annotation were identified as being affected both by temperature and low oxygen. this suggests that although chronic high temperature and low oxygen stress affects many identical mechanism in fish, they do not necessary invoke these effects through differential regulation of the same individual genes. the low degree of overlap may in part rely on the two different methods applied for cdna library construction, as discussed below. in marine environments it is generally held that dissolved oxygen concentrations below 2-3 mg o2/l is considered hypoxic  <cit> . by this definition, the low oxygen stress used in the current experiment did not account as hypoxia, but for simplicity we use the “low oxygen stress” and “hypoxia” terms interchangeable throughout the discussion. in coldwater salmonids, behavioral responses to hypoxia have been detected already at 8 mg o2/l  <cit> , but dissolved oxygen conditions below 6 mg o2/l is generally regarded as hypoxic for atlantic salmon  <cit> . whether the observed responses reported here should be considered as stress or allostasis  <cit>  is arguable, but animals experiencing long-term disturbances will tend to adjust their physiology toward normal homeostasis. even so, over time these moderate stressors may have a negative impact on fitness, as suggested by the reduced growth seen in both experiments.

interestingly, temperature stress appears to down-regulate several important liver transcription regulators. mycn, hnf1a, hnf4a and nfe2l <dig> were among the transcription regulators that were inhibited by high temperature. this finding suggests that heat stress may have had an effect on the transcriptional rate in salmon liver. at the same time, most of the upstream regulators with a predicted activated state are typically associated with responses induced by chemical drugs. thus, the key liver transcriptional factors affected by temperature stress suggest an effect on overall transcription, while at the same time the environmental stimuli seems to induce transcription of genes most often linked to effects of toxicants. the results suggest a switch toward increased transcription of protective enzymes at the cost of synthesis of maintenance enzymes. based on the rt-qpcr results from the heat stress study, it appears clear that liver transcription in atlantic salmon is considerable affected at temperatures above 17°c. of the evaluated markers for oxidative stress, four out of five genes, cuzn sod, mn sod, gpx <dig> and gr, were lower expressed in liver of fish kept at 19°c than in fish kept at optimal temperature at 13°c, while three genes, cuzn sod, gpx <dig> and gr, also showed significant lower expression in fish kept at 17°c. this could be due to reduced mitochondrial ros production as a result of reduced overall metabolism at higher temperature, although, in general, elevated environmental temperature results in enhanced oxygen consumption and ros production and thereby increased oxidative stress in fish  <cit> . high temperature mediated lower expression of several of the other evaluated genes also, including hif1a. the only gene that showed a significant higher expression in heat-stressed fish was hsp90b. in heat stressed fish, hsp90b was positively correlated with hsp <dig>  but this transcript showed no significant correlation with any of the other evaluated genes, as opposed to for example hif1a, whose expression was significantly correlated with all evaluated transcripts except for the two heat shock protein transcripts hsp <dig> and hsp90b.

several overrepresented go terms in fish exposed to low oxygen were associated with tissue development and growth. the go enrichment analysis thus suggests a distinct response to low oxygen at the molecular level, with the sub-optimal oxygen concentration affecting transcripts encoding proteins important for continued growth. according to the ipa analysis, hypoxia induced effects on “organismal development” including lipid and nucleic acid metabolism at the molecular level, with protein ubiquitination as the most strongly affected pathway. the predicted top upstream regulators,  <dig> -dithiol-3-thione, sirolimus, pirintrix acid, cd <dig> and 5-fluorouracil, suggest an effect leading to increased apoptosis and negative weight gain. glutathione depletion and signaling effects possibly induced by nuclear factor -like  <dig>  in the liver seems a likely explanation for these findings. nfe2l <dig> is a transcription activator that binds to antioxidant response elements  in the promoter regions of target genes important for the coordinated regulation of genes in response to oxidative stress  <cit> . of the oxidative stress marker genes evaluated with rt-qpcr, only gr showed a significant effect of low oxygen treatment. gr is crucial in glutathione metabolism and maintains high levels of reduced glutathione in the cytosol. in a previous study in which atlantic cod  were exposed to 46% o <dig> saturation for six weeks, we observed down-regulation of transcripts encoding cuzn sod and gpx <dig>  <cit> . altered regulation of genes involved in glutathione metabolism strengthens the predicted effect of hypoxia on nfe2l <dig> regulated oxidative stress markers. three of the predicted five top significant upstream regulators induced by hypoxia were also among the top five most significant upstream regulators induced by temperature stress, i.e. 5-fluorouracil, cd <dig> and sirolimus, suggesting a partly overlapping response to the two stressors.

a compelling finding was that among the  <dig> common genes were two transcripts encoding proteins typically involved in detoxification of persistent organic pollutants , i.e. cyp1a and gsta <dig>  both transcripts were higher expressed in temperature-stressed fish liver. due to the high fat content in muscle, farmed atlantic salmon are prone to accumulate relatively high levels of lipophilic pops in fillet and liver  <cit> . one can therefore speculate that elevated temperature may have affected the storage and turnover of pops in salmon muscle and liver, as influx and efflux rates of toxicants across membranes increase with increasing temperature  <cit> . in temperature-stressed salmon, lipids stored in muscle tissue are increasingly being used for maintenance energy metabolism  <cit> . erod activity is temperature dependent in fish  <cit> , so if increased erod activity over time is followed by increased transcription, a temperature effect on cyp1a transcription might be expected. in gills of rainbow trout  held at  <dig> or 23°c for two weeks, heat stress up-regulated several drug-metabolizing protein transcripts including phase i and ii enzyme transcripts such as cyp1a, cyp1c <dig>  ugt2b <dig>  and xenobiotic transporter abcg <dig>  <cit> , clearly suggesting a temperature effect on drug-metabolizing enzyme transcription in salmonids. since both aryl hydrocarbon receptor  and hif- <dig> compete for aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator , hypoxia could be expected to decrease the expression of p <dig> genes  <cit> . indeed, in atlantic cod exposed to 46% hypoxia for six weeks we observed cyp1a transcript down-regulation  <cit> . rahman and thomas  <cit>  also observed a down-regulation of cyp1a mrna and protein levels in liver of atlantic croaker  exposed to hypoxia  compared to fish held in normoxic condition, and suggested that hypoxia-induced down-regulation of cyp1a is due to alterations of nitric oxide and oxidant status, and cellular il-1beta and hif-alpha levels. in threespine stickleback  acutely exposed to hypoxia for 4-48 hours, leveelahti et al.  <cit> , however, observed increased expression of cyp1a <dig> mrna, a finding also confirmed at the protein level by erod activity measurement. these findings suggest that hypoxia exposure may affect the expression of ahr-mediated p <dig> genes. the reason for the altered transcription of cyp1a in hypoxia-stressed fish, which we were not able to independently verify with rt-qpcr in the current work, should be studied further.

metabolic responses to ensure cell survival during hypoxia exposure involve metabolic reorganization to decrease atp demands to match the reduced capacity for atp production  <cit> . several signal transduction cascades, including amp-activated protein kinase  and hif- <dig>  are activated in response to hypoxia in fishes and other vertebrates  <cit> . ampk activation in mammals inhibits energetically costly anabolic processes such as protein synthesis, glycogen synthesis, and fatty acid synthesis rates  <cit> . one ampk gene, the 5-amp-activated protein kinase subunit beta- <dig> , was found included in our dataset from the low oxygen exposure gene list but was not present in the normoxia library gene list. the prkab <dig> subunit of ampk may be a positive regulator of ampk activity  <cit> . also present in the hypoxia gene list but not present in the normoxia gene list was the hypoxia-inducible factor 1a . hif1a is a transcription factor that functions as a master regulator of gene expression in response to hypoxia  <cit> . hif- <dig> protein is a heterodimer composed of an alpha and a beta subunit that is involved in cellular processes such as energy metabolism, apoptosis, proliferation, death and growth. both acute and chronic hypoxia can distinctly affect mrna levels of hif- <dig>  and this gene has been suggested as a reliable fish biomarker of hypoxia exposure  <cit> . heat treatment mediated a reduced expression of hif1a mrna in liver of atlantic salmon. according to the rt-qpcr data hif1a transcription appeared to be stimulated at moderate heat stress , but was significantly lower at more severe heat stress . a similar response pattern has been observed in the north sea eelpout , with elevated dna binding activity of hif- <dig> during mild heat exposure  but impaired activity at more severe heat stress  <cit> . a possible link between temperature and hif- <dig> activity has previously also been shown for crucian carp  <cit> .

insulin-like growth factors binding proteins  play important roles in down-regulating igf availability and cell growth and development in vertebrates exposed to hypoxic stress  <cit> . gracey et al.  <cit>  observed increased transcription of igfbp <dig> in liver of longjaw mudsucker and shortjaw mudsucker  after acute exposure to hypoxia, in line with our finding. in zebrafish embryos it has been shown that hypoxia strongly induces transcription of the igfbp <dig>  <cit> . overexpression of igfbp <dig> resulted in reduced growth in zebrafish embryos under normoxic condition, suggesting that the igfbp <dig> protein plays an important role on fish growth during hypoxia and may even be an activator of the hif- <dig> system. in line with our finding, rahman and thomas  <cit>  found that chronic hypoxia exposure  caused significant increase in liver igfbp <dig> mrna in atlantic croaker. igfbp <dig> transcription thus appears to be a good biomarker for chronic hypoxia also in atlantic salmon. two igfbp <dig> genes have been found in atlantic salmon possibility due to whole genome duplication  <cit> , and these seem to be differentially regulated at the transcriptional level in liver after chronic low oxygen stress but not after temperature stress. heat stress, induced by a temperature increase from 13°c to 17°c, appears to increase the transcription of both igfbp1a  and igfbp1b  <cit>  in atlantic salmon. chronic low oxygen stress mediated a significant change only for the igfbp1b ortholog.

both applied cdna library construction methods represent a semi-quantitative measure of transcript abundance. ssh cdna libraries are prone to false positives, whereas normalized cdna libraries, by removing high-abundant rrna transcripts, increase sequence coverage depth and transcript diversity across non-rrna populations  <cit> . for this reason we have not attempted to compare the libraries quantitatively. by using pooled samples, and two different library construction methods, the rna-seq data presented here should be considered indicative rather than exact quantitative measures of molecular effects of treatments that mitigate effects at the physiological level, i.e. reduced growth. as expected, fewer large contigs, contigs of at least 500 bp, were obtained by using ssh cdna libraries than by using normalized cdna libraries. with ssh technology, about  <dig> large contigs were obtained from the heat stress experiment, whereas about  <dig> large contigs were obtained from the normalized libraries. more equal numbers were obtained from the four cdna libraries by selecting contigs consisting of more than  <dig> reads for the functional analyses. the selected strategy may have created a bias toward higher expressed genes, but represents a trade-off between confounding the pathway analysis by using too many input genes and lost strength by not including enough low-expressed genes.

additionally, duplicated salmon co-orthologs may represent a problem in comparing the rna-seq and rt-qpcr data. co-orthologs with high sequence similarity may show differential expression but obtain similar best annotation. this phenomenon may explain the apparently contradictory finding for the cyp1a gene. according to the ssh library data, cyp1a was up-regulated by heat stress, while at the same time the rt-qpcr analysis suggested cyp1a to be down-regulated. differential expression of orthologous hif1a genes has recently been described in cyprinids, with one of the orthologs being more sensitive to oxygen tension  <cit> . at present, no information on orthologous hif1a genes and their potential differential regulation are available for atlantic salmon.

CONCLUSIONS
this study suggests that environmental stress such as high temperature and low oxygen saturation, possibly becoming more widespread by global warming, may negatively affect growth in farmed atlantic salmon. while heat stress in general appears to reduce the overall transcriptional rate, increased protein catabolism appears to be one of the main effects of low oxygen saturation stress. predicted upstream transcriptional regulators suggest that the two types of stress affect many identical mechanisms in liver cells resulting in a metabolic depression.
