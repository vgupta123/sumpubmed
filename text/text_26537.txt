BACKGROUND
erk <dig> and erk <dig>  are most likely the best studied members of the mitogen activated protein kinase  proteins. despite much effort and their biological and medical importance, still relatively few in vivo downstream targets of these kinases have been identified conclusively, especially when considering the numerous cellular events and signaling networks they are involved in  <cit> . most of the target proteins and downstream genes have been identified by in vitro studies using cell culture systems. specific roles for both erks are described for cellular proliferation, as mouse embryos fibroblasts  isolated from erk1-/- mice grew faster than wild type cells. the tumorgenicity of transplanted nih 3t <dig> cells stably expressing an oncogenic form of ras in nude mice was largely inhibited by co-transfection of erk <dig>  but not by erk <dig> or p <dig>  <cit> . in diseases, erk <dig> and erk <dig> can display distinct cellular functions, as has been shown for the formation of cancer  <cit> . the upstream activators mek <dig> and mek <dig> have also been shown to play a role in human diseases such as cardio-facio-cutaneous  syndrome  <cit> . in addition, divergent roles for erk <dig> and erk <dig> were already shown by the different effect of the knockout studies performed in mice since erk1-/- mice are viable and fertile  <cit> , while erk2-/- mice die in utero before embryonic day   <dig>   <cit> .

to study and compare the developmental roles of erk <dig> and erk <dig> we used specific morpholino antisense oligonucleotides , to block translation of erk <dig> and erk <dig>  we previously showed that saturated knockdown conditions of erk <dig> led to severe phenotype, as erk2mo morphants did not go into epiboly, whereas erk1mo morphants still developed further and entered gastrulation stages. in addition, immuno-histochemical studies showed that erk phosphorylation was completely abolished in the blastula margin of erk <dig> morphants, indicating that erk <dig> is the active erk mapk in the margin and essential for epiboly initiation and further progression of the developmental program . possibly erk <dig> also functions in mesendodermal differentiation processes in the blastula margin, as fgf is known to activate the canonical mapk pathway in a ras dependent manner . the severe phenotype of erk <dig> morphants indicate that erk <dig> has a more dominant role than erk <dig> during early developmental processes, as also suggested by the mice knockout phenotypes.

here we aim to further determine specific downstream gene targets of erk <dig> and erk <dig> during vertebrate development, by performing expression profiling analysis using a microarray approach. we compared the expression profiles of erk <dig> and erk <dig> knockdown embryos, using specific morpholino antisense oligonucleotides , which specifically block the translation of a gene of interest into a functional protein  <cit> . recently developed software programs and web-based analysis tools, e.g. rosetta resolver, genmapp and genetools egon were used for the processing and comparisons of large expression datasets and biological interpretation of the data and to facilitate the prediction of interconnections between developmental signaling pathways that were tested by biological assays .

analysis of the obtained data revealed that erk1mo and erk2mo knockdown affect signature sets of common target genes, as well as signature sets of specific genes. surprisingly, we also identified gene sets in which the expression patterns were anti-correlated. several signature marker genes identified in this study were confirmed by quantitative real time pcr and in situ hybridization. we performed signaling pathway analysis on the obtained erk <dig> and erk <dig> transcriptome signatures, using the genmapp software program  <cit>  for the analysis of important signaling cascades during early vertebrate development. these include bmp, fgf, nodal and wnt signaling pathways  <cit> . for erk <dig> knockdown we identified a connection with genes involved in dorsal-ventral patterning and subsequent embryonic cell migration. for erk <dig> knockdown we identified a connection with genes involved in mesoderm and endoderm initiation, differentiation and patterning. many of these genes also play a role in morphogenic cell migration processes during later stages of development. the outcomes of the predictions for erk <dig> knockdown on developmental signaling were confirmed by in situ hybridization experiments indicating that erk <dig> controls mesoderm and endoderm initiation, maintenance and patterning.

RESULTS
distinct gene expression signature sets of erk <dig> and erk <dig> knockdown embryos
a morpholino knockdown approach was used to block translation of either erk <dig> or erk <dig> by injection of  <dig>  mm  morpholinos  targeting erk <dig>  or erk <dig> . the knockdown embryos, also referred to as morphants, showed severe phenotypes after depletion of erk <dig>  these embryos did not enter epiboly at  <dig>  hpf and the blastula cells remained on top of the yolk, preventing further development of the embryo . in addition, erk <dig> knockdown induces disorganization of the margin. . wild type embryos reached 30% epiboly at this time   <cit> . in contrast, erk <dig> morphants did not show any obvious phenotypes at this point yet and had entered epiboly . however, erk <dig> morphants did show strong phenotypes at later stages in embryogenesis .

the specificity of erk <dig> and erk <dig> knockdown phenotypes was rescued by co-injection of synthetic mrna , western blot analysis  and immuno-localization in wildtype, erk1mo and erk2mo injected embryos at  <dig>  hpf  using a phospho-specific erk antibody . erk <dig> morphants  show similar levels of dperk staining at the dorsal margin compared to wild type embryos , but the dperk signal in erk <dig> morphants is reduced at the ventral half of the margin. erk2mo injected embryos hardly show any dperk staining and the active erk signal is depleted from the marginal ring in these embryos . quantification of a western blot analysis of zebrafish wild type, erk1mo and erk2mo injected embryos, probes with a global erk antibody , recognizes both zebrafish erk <dig>  and erk <dig>  protein clearly shows the specific knockdown of either erk <dig> or erk <dig> by the corresponding morpholino .

addition of different mek specific inhibitors , did not result in the same phenotypes as obtained by the erk2mo mediated knockdown. the inhibiting effects of these drugs were confirmed by western blot analysis, but apparently these effects were not efficient enough to block epiboly . because it is not possible to address the specific functions of either erk <dig> or erk <dig> using these chemical inhibitors, we did not proceed with these experiments.

these data prove the functionality of the morpholino-mediated knockdown of either erk <dig> or erk <dig>  in addition, the severe phenotype of erk <dig> morphants indicate defects in crucial early developmental processes and most likely affects the expression levels of a larger number of genes than knockdown of erk <dig> 

distinct erk-knockdown gene expression profiles in time
to identify specific gene pools affected by the knockdown of erk <dig> or erk <dig>  and to identify possible downstream targets, microarray based transcriptome analysis was performed using agilent zebrafish microarrays. as a control for aspecific morpholino effects, a standard control morpholino  was injected in the same concentration. this did not result in any phenotypes during zebrafish development. the rna from these standard control mo injected embryos was used as a reference to compare the transcriptomes of both erk1mo and erk2mo injected embryos. we annotated the agilent 22k-zebrafish microarray chip by blast searches with all oligonucleotide sequences in the zebrafish genome. from the complete number of  <dig> oligonucleotides from the agilent 22k zebrafish chip,  <dig> oligonucleotides were assigned a unigene id . the phenotypic effect of erk <dig> depletion was observed at 30% epiboly indicating an altered gene expression profile at earlier stages. therefore we analyzed the gene-expression profile of erk <dig> morphants at more time points than erk <dig> morphants . we obtained gene expression profiles for erk <dig> morphants at  <dig>  hpf and  <dig> hpf, and for erk <dig> morphants at  <dig>  hpf,  <dig>  hpf,  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf , as shown in figure 2c and 2d.

comparison of the gene expression profiles of erk <dig> and erk <dig> morphants at various stages showed a larger number of unigene identifiers with significant changes  in erk <dig> compare to erk <dig> morphants in time, as illustrated in a venn-diagram . these venn diagrams also show that  <dig> genes are affected in expression at both 30% and 80% epiboly in erk <dig> morphants, whereas in the erk <dig> morphants time-series, we find  <dig> genes to be significantly changed in expression in all time points. at 30% and 80% epiboly the numbers of genes with an altered expression was larger and with a higher fold of change for erk <dig> than for erk <dig> morphants . this is in agreement with the phenotype of erk <dig> knockdown embryos that indicates a more prominent role for erk <dig> in early development . the effect of erk <dig> knockdown becomes more pronounced at 80% epiboly . this indicates that erk <dig> may become relatively more important at later developmental stages.

comparing the effect of erk <dig> and erk <dig> knockdown, we found distinct gene expression signature sets during embryonic development. . in addition to commonly affected genes , we found distinct genes that were specifically regulated by either knockdown of erk <dig> ;  <dig> vs.  <dig> up-regulated,  <dig> vs.  <dig> down-regulated at  <dig> or 80% epiboly respectively) or knockdown of erk <dig> ;  <dig> vs.  <dig> up-regulated,  <dig> vs.  <dig> down-regulated), or genes which were regulated in an anti-correlated manner:  <dig> genes  or  <dig> genes  were up-regulated by knockdown of erk <dig> whereas they were down-regulated by knockdown of erk <dig>  and  <dig> genes  or  <dig> genes  were down-regulated by knockdown of erk <dig> whereas they were up-regulated by knockdown of erk <dig> . these results confirm that erk <dig> and erk <dig> mapk are key regulators of distinct gene signature sets during embryonic development. this is supported even when comparing multiple gene expression profiles from different developmental time-points .

because we observed a strong activated erk signal in the margin at the onset of epiboly, we compared the expression levels of a selection of genes that are described to be expressed in the margin at the onset of epiboly in time. to do so, a gene-expression trend-line of the selected margin genes for erk <dig> and erk <dig> morphants was constructed . most of the selected genes did not give a significant difference in time upon erk <dig> knockdown, suggesting different developmental functions for erk <dig>  whereas in erk <dig> morphants the expression levels of most of the selected 'margin'-genes was affected. a common trend in the expression-levels of the selected genes was observed upon erk <dig> depletion, as most genes showed stabilization in their expression levels between 30% epiboly and shield stage, and even recovery between  <dig> to  <dig> hpf. despite this, the presumptive blastula cells remained on top of erk <dig> morphants. this indicates that the obtained gene expression profiles of later stages of erk <dig> morphants  are the results of a prolonged epiboly arrest, most likely due to multiple secondary developmental defects . to analyze possible apoptotic effects in the erk <dig> morphants, we also made similar trend lines with a selection of genes that are associated with apoptotic responses . the apoptotic responses by the erk1mo treatment are minimal and also erk2mo injected embryos do not show obvious responses in the earlier stages . however, the apoptosis responsive genes casp <dig> and casp <dig> revealed an increased expression at 8hpf in erk <dig> morphants. these combined results were the rational for limiting the further comparisons of the effects of erk <dig> and erk <dig> knockdown at 30% epiboly.

the identified gene-sets of correlated and anti-correlated regulated genes by knockdown of either erk <dig> or erk <dig> at 30% epiboly are listed and annotated . to identify the erk1mo and erk2mo specific genes, we focused on the genes that were most significantly affected. therefore we used the following criteria: the absolute fold change must be at least  <dig>  in each independent replicate and the common p-value provided by the error-model taking into account all hybridizations must be smaller than 10- <dig>  the genes that were only found in either erk1mo or erk2mo gene-pools were manually annotated and assigned gene designations .

quantitative real time pcr analyses confirm the different erk1- and erk2- knockdown gene expression profiles
to confirm the results of the microarrays experiments, quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr analysis was performed on seven regulated genes at  <dig>  hpf  that were chosen as hallmarks of the differences between the erk <dig> and erk <dig> morphant expression profiles. the expression levels were tested on the same rna samples as used for the microarray analysis for cdh <dig> , mycn , erm , cfos , mos , snai1a  and vegf  . β-actin was taken as reference to determine the relative expression levels of the selected genes in erk1mo, erk2mo and standard control mo injected embryos. the obtained qpcr data show that the expression levels of cdh <dig>  mycn, erm and snai1a are down-regulated in both erk1mo and erk2mo conditions, compared to standard control mo , whereas the expression level of mos is up-regulated in both erk1mo and erk2mo. the analysis of cfos and vegf confirmed the anti-correlated regulation comparing erk <dig> and erk <dig> knockdown to standard control mo conditions. both genes are down-regulated by knockdown of erk <dig> and up-regulated by knockdown of erk <dig>  compared to the expression-level of fos and vegf in standard control mo treated embryos .

in summary, the qpcr data confirmed the change in expression levels of the selected genes as observed by microarray analysis for all genes tested, thereby confirming the unique gene expression profiles for erk1mo and erk2mo mediated knockdown in early zebrafish development at  <dig>  hpf .

gene ontology  analysis
the gene expression signatures of the erk <dig> and erk <dig> morphants were used to perform gene ontology  analysis. this provides an unbiased biological gene enrichment analysis based on biological properties  assigned per gene. gene ontologies describe gene products in terms of their associated biological processes , cellular components  and molecular functions  in a species-independent manner. the results of this analysis showed a significant relative over- or under-representation of the number of unigene ids in erk <dig> versus erk <dig> morphants within the go categories . for erk <dig> and erk <dig> knockdown signature sets we obtained remarkable differences in the significantly enriched categories in the highest analyzed go-level : for instance  <dig> vs.  <dig> enriched go-terms are associated with biological processes ,  <dig> vs.  <dig> enriched go terms are associated with cellular components  and  <dig> vs.  <dig> enriched go terms are associated with molecular functions , respectively.

comparing the erk <dig> and erk <dig> knockdown signature sets various particular differences in over- or under-represented go-terms were found. for example, both the go-terms cell cycle  and apoptosis  are significantly enriched upon erk <dig> knockdown. however, looking at the gene-lists in more detail inhibitory factors of apoptosis are mostly down-regulated, whereas positive regulators of cell cycle were up-regulated, indicating that apoptosis was not induced by the depletion of erk <dig> at 30% epiboly  confirming our earlier conclusion from the time series. cell adhesion  and the cellular component go terms 'tight junction' and 'cell junctions' are only significantly under-represented in the signature set of erk <dig> morphants. regulation of cell adhesion and the organization of tight- and cell-junctions are crucial for cell migration processes. specifically for erk <dig> knockdown a significantly enrichment of the 'translator regulator activity'  go-cluster was found. in contrast, the relative enrichment of this go term in erk <dig> morphants showed an under-representation. a significant overrepresentation of the go term biosynthesis in erk <dig> morphants correlates with these observations.

the go-enrichment analysis showed that the number of genes within the go-cluster 'development'  were significantly under-represented for both erk <dig>  and erk <dig>  morphants. from the  <dig> development-related genes whose expression was affected by erk <dig> knockdown,  <dig> genes  were not found in the erk <dig> knockdown signature set. this supports the notion that erk <dig> and erk <dig> may have distinct functions during embryogenesis by affecting the gene-expression of common and distinct genes sets during vertebrate development.

genmapp pathways for zebrafish
to further analyze putative down stream targets of erk <dig> and erk <dig> involved in early development, we focused on essential signaling pathways that are involved in early embryonic differentiation and patterning; nodal, fgf, wnt and bmp-signaling pathways   <cit> . for our study, we used the signaling pathway analyzing software program, genmapp   <cit> . this program is designed for viewing and analyzing gene expression data in the context of biological pathways and allows microarray-mediated gene expression signature sets to be displayed on biological  pathways  <cit> . in contrast for human and mouse gene expression data-sets, where most signaling pathways are available for this program, there are no genmapp pathways based on zebrafish literature available yet for analyzing our gene expression datasets. therefore, we first generated the in silico genmapp pathways for the zebrafish nodal, fgf,  wnt and bmp signaling pathways . this provides a valuable tool for the research community that makes use of zebrafish. the construction of these genmapp signaling pathways is based on what is specifically described in literature for zebrafish development, supported by the described knowledge for other vertebrate signaling processes and canonical signaling models, found on the science's stke connections map database  <cit> . although it is clear that the nodal, fgf, wnt and bmp pathways are all interconnected, resulting in a complex signaling network, we performed a pathway-based analysis focusing on separate signaling pathways since the ways these signaling pathways exactly interconnect on a molecular scale is hardly understood yet.

pathway analysis of erk1mo and erk2mo mediated knockdown expression profiles
the unigene id linked erk1mo and erk2mo signature sets that were used for genemapp analysis were not limited by fold change but instead we used all genes that had a combined p-value for changed expression, compared to the standard control morpholino treated embryos, smaller than 10- <dig>  as previously mentioned, the number of genes that showed a changed expression in erk2mo compared to erk1mo injected embryos was far larger. therefore, as expected, more genes with changed expression levels were found in the in silico genmapps signaling pathways for erk2mo, than for erk1mo.

knockdown of erk <dig> did show only one gene  with a significantly changed expression level within our bmp signaling genmapp . however, more genes were affected in fgf signaling: fgf17b  the mapkkk mos, , transcription factor cmyc  and srf  showed significant changes in expression. in the nodal pathway, the nodal antagonist lft1/antivin <dig>  and the egf-cfc co-receptor oep  were the only components found to be affected in erk <dig> morphants. furthermore, the ventrally expressed wnt8-mediated organizer inhibitory gene vent  <cit>  was down-regulated . other genes involved in wnt-signaling affected by erk <dig> knockdown were dab <dig> , ck2b  and ppp2r5e <dig> . these genes are also considered to be involved in early embryonic pattering pathways. two genes involved in regulating gastrulation cell migration, one-eyed pinhead  and quattro  <cit> , were altered in expression.

the effect of depletion of erk <dig> was far more severe in most of the analyzed signaling processes . key components of the fgf-pathway  and downstream target genes  were down-regulated, indicating a block of the fgf-erk pathway by erk <dig> knockdown . expression of some of these  target genes is initiated by nodal. the nodal-genes like boz/dharma, squint/ndr <dig> and smad <dig> are up-regulated, whereas inhibiting genes lefty <dig>  and the ventral genes vox  and ved  are down-regulated in erk <dig> morphants . other nodal signaling mediator genes that are down-regulated are oep , p <dig> , foxh1/sur  and the negative regulator of tgfβ signaling tgif . the nodal-mediated endoderm gene sox32/casanova, expressed in the margin, was down-regulated , and also the downstream target-gene axial/foxa <dig> . interestingly, squint/ndr <dig> also functions as a positive regulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling pathway  <cit> .

the wnt ligand wnt <dig> and receptors  and the central mediator β-catenin <dig> were down-regulated in erk <dig> morphants, suggesting a severe inhibitory effect or even complete block of these pathways at this level . this inhibition of the wnt pathway is also supported by the up-regulation of axin2/conductin, a scaffold protein from the β-catenin destruction complex, responsible for the degradation of beta-catenin  <cit> . down-regulation of the putative wnt-target genes vox, vent, but also otx <dig>  sp <dig>  and lim <dig> further support impaired wnt-signaling. however, erk <dig> knockdown also led to the down-regulation of the inhibitors dkk <dig> and sfrp <dig>  and up-regulation of the intracellular wnt-signaling components fxd8c, dab <dig>  β-catenin <dig> and tcf <dig> 

the effect of erk <dig> knockdown on bmp signaling is also complex, as bmp <dig> is up-regulated whereas bmp1a/tolloid and bmp <dig> are down-regulated . this opposing effect is also found in the bmp antagonists, as chordin  and the ventrally expressed membrane bound bmp-inhibitor bambi were down-regulated, whereas a different bmp antagonist gremlin is up-regulated. adding to this complexity is the fact that the agonist twisted gastrulation  is up-regulated. the results clearly show that that dorsal-ventral patterning and also mesoderm patterning is severely affected but it is difficult to speculate about the downstream effects of all these changes of expression in the bmp pathway.

biological confirmation of pathway analysis based prediction
to confirm predicted effects of the genmapp pathway analysis experimentally and to add information on the localization of expression, we performed whole mount in situ hybridization on erk <dig> and erk <dig> morphants at 30% epiboly with marker genes regulated by nodal, bmp, wnt and fgf . different components of the wnt-β-catenin pathway showed lower expression levels in erk <dig> morphants. we showed that goosecoid   <cit> , a downstream marker gene for the wnt pathway at early developmental stages  is not expressed in the erk <dig> morphants. knockdown of erk <dig> did lead to a significant effect on the expression of gsc, but after knockdown of erk <dig> no expression of gsc was detected by whole mount in situ hybridization. this confirms that canonical wnt signaling was severely affected in erk <dig> morphants, preventing subsequent expression of the wnt-target gene gsc.

the lefty  <dig>  gene is a member of the tgf-beta super-family that regulates left-right axis formation during embryogenesis via antagonistic activity against nodal, another tgf-beta super-family member. expression starts at blastula stage, immediately after initiation of zygotic transcription, and is localized in the whole blastula margin at late blastula – 30% epiboly stage  <cit> . whole mount in situ hybridization with lefty <dig> probe  at 30% epiboly shows a possible increase of lefty <dig> expression in erk <dig> morphants , but the decrease of expression in erk <dig> morphants  was clearly visible. as lefty <dig> is both an antagonists of nodal signaling as well as a nodal responsive gene, an increase of lft <dig> expression could mean that the signaling is sufficient and must be inhibited , like in a wild type situation. a decrease in expression would mean that nodal signaling not yet sufficient. expression of mesoderm-genes in the margin indicates that  mesoderm initiation took place in erk <dig> morphants, however at a much reduced level .

in zebrafish, vox and vent interact with bozozok , which is the earliest expressed dorsal-specific gene, and studies of boz embryos and the effects of ectopic boz expression indicate that it functions at the top of a hierarchy. vox and vent are proposed to be repressors of boz expression since ectopic vox and vent eliminated the appearance of boz to establish the dorsal organize  <cit> . the expression signatures from the erk <dig> and erk <dig> morphants revealed that vox expression was not significantly changed in erk <dig> morphants, but was down-regulated in erk <dig> morphants., whereas for vent -expression this seemed to be opposite, as its expression was down-regulated in erk <dig> morphants, but not significantly changed in erk <dig> morphants . the expression patterns of these genes revealed a possible reduction of vox expression in erk <dig> morphants, which was more obvious on the putative dorsal side of the embryo where a clear cap was observed. the expression of vent was also reduced in erk <dig> morphants and did not extend as far dorsally  compared to wild type embryos , indicating a mild dorsalization of erk <dig> morphants. in erk <dig> morphants, vox expression seemed to be reduced to a greater extend at the ventral side, but in the rest of the blastula the reduction of vox expression was not as significant and expression of vent was only detected at the ventral side of the blastula margin . in support of these finding, the expression of boz was found also to be up-regulated  in erk <dig> morphants. combined, these findings confirm that knockdown of erk <dig> leads to impaired wnt-mediated vox and vent expression which is reported to be involved in mesoderm patterning and maintenance.

the zebrafish ntl gene is, like the tbx <dig> gene, a member of the brachyury-related t-box family of genes. notail  is involved in mesoderm development, as described in the legend to figure  <dig>  at 30% epiboly ntl is expressed in the blastula margin  <cit> . this expression is synergistically regulated by fgf and nodal signaling pathways  <cit> . both of these pathways show a negative regulation in the erk <dig> morphants, as shown by the genmapp analysis . the negative effect on these pathways and the array-data itself suggested a down-regulation of the ntl-gene upon erk <dig> knockdown, and was confirmed by whole mount in situ experiments . the ntl gene expression in erk <dig> morphants was comparable to expression in wild type embryos, but ntl expression was decreased in erk <dig> morphants. strikingly, expression of ntl was not constant in the marginal ring, as stronger expression was detected in the putative dorsal side of the erk <dig> morphants.

tbx <dig> is exclusively expressed in the ventral mesendoderm and its expression is linked to ventral mesoderm specification  <cit> . in erk <dig> morphants the in situ hybridization experiment showed that tbx <dig> expression was not extended as far dorsally as in wild type embryos, as tbx <dig> expression at the putative dorsal side of these embryos was severely reduced . in erk <dig> morphants, tbx <dig> expression was greatly reduced and was only detected at the ventral margin . in erk <dig> morphants tbx6-expression an even more severe reduction of tbx <dig> expression was down-regulated .

the obtained results by whole mount in situ hybridization using gsc, lft, vox, vent, ntl and tbx <dig>  confirm or support the predictions made by the genmapp analysis, as the changes in their expression levels are in agreement with the predictions obtained by the signaling pathway analysis of the microarray data.

discussion
specific functions of most proteins in vertebrate development remain elusive because of potential redundancies. in this manuscript we present a case study that indicates that the combination of micro-array analysis and targeted knockdown of essential embryonic genes in zebrafish can provide new insights in the specific targets of key regulators of development. for this study we have chosen the mitogen activated protein kinase members erk <dig> and erk <dig> because they are involved in virtually all eukaryotic cellular processes and signaling networks but still little is known of their specific functions in development. the proteins show high amino acids identity and have redundancy potential; however this does not exclude specific target genes.

these archetypal signaling proteins are good examples for showing the power of this approach since the upstream activation pathways for erk <dig> and erk <dig> are highly similar, and many of their known downstream targets are common. in contrast to this, mice and zebrafish studies indicate distinct roles for both erks in cellular proliferation, oncogenic transformation and development. a major bottleneck for further studies is that relatively few in vivo downstream targets of these kinases and upstream activators such as mek <dig> and mek <dig> have been identified conclusively. our manuscript uses microarray technology and bioinformatics to document the functional differences between the erk <dig> and erk <dig> proteins at the transcriptome level at different time points during zebrafish development. the obtained data is projected on a model of our current knowledge of several developmental signaling pathways. this gives new mechanistic insights in how erk signaling is functioning and integrates with other known effectors of vertebrate embryogenesis.

erk <dig> and erk <dig> target distinct genes during early zebrafish development
comparison of the gene expression profiles of the erk <dig> and erk <dig> morphants during early embryogenesis, with standard control mo injected embryos as a shared reference, showed specific gene expression profiles. distinct gene expression signatures were obtained for erk <dig> and erk <dig> knockdown embryos, proving that both erk <dig> and erk <dig> target specific gene pools during zebrafish embryogenesis . the gene expression profiles of erk <dig> and erk <dig> knockdown embryos showed sets of genes that were commonly regulated, but also genes that was regulated in an anti-correlated manner, involved in cell cycle, proliferation, cell differentiation, metabolism, cytoskeleton dynamics, signal transduction, migration and transcription. this observation is in line with the notion that erk <dig> and erk <dig> may have specific downstream targets, as proposed in a model by alison lloyd  <cit> , mainly based on the work of vantaggiato et al.  <cit> , where they show that co-transfection of either erk <dig> or erk <dig> with an oncogenic form of ras, has different effects on proliferation and ras-induced transformation. in addition to this, erk1-/- mice are viable and fertile  <cit> , whereas disruption of erk <dig> is embryonic lethal due to defects in placenta formation, trophectoderm and mesoderm differentiation  <cit> . activation of the upstream signaling of erk have also shown a role for this pathway in diseases such as cardio-faciocutaneous syndrome and carcinogenesis. furthermore a developmental role of meks was shown: mek <dig> knockout mice are phenotypically normal, whereas mek <dig> knockout mice die at embryonic day   <dig>  due to abnormal development and insufficient vascularization of the placenta  <cit> . studies in mouse es cells showed that erk <dig> disruption does not interfere with proliferation of undifferentiated es cells  <cit> . although erk1-/- mice present normal mesoderm differentiation, they do show defective adipocyte formation  <cit> . the exact mechanisms for erk signaling in adipocyte development, likely via the adipocyte-specific transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, is still under debate  <cit> . the significant over-representation of the go-terms 'metabolism', 'biosynthesis' and 'macro-molecule biosynthesis'  may indicate that also in zebrafish adipocyte-development is erk <dig> dependent which would be in line with our suggestion, that role for erk <dig> becomes more dominant at later developmental stages . however, further studies at even later  stages of development need to be performed to confirm this hypothesis.

the higher number of genes affected by the knockdown of erk <dig> is in agreement with the severe phenotype of erk <dig> knockdown embryos . in order to understand the severe effects of erk1/ <dig> knockdown, we have to consider the results in the context of the known signaling pathways that govern developmental programs as proliferation, cell migration and differentiation processes. therefore we first generated in silico signaling pathway, for analysis of important signaling pathways involved in early vertebrate development and performed analysis on the erk <dig> and erk <dig> transcriptome signatures using the genmapp software program. these include the nodal, fgf, wnt and bmp signaling pathways.

erk <dig> and erk <dig> are involved in different developmental processes
for biological interpretation of the obtained expression profiles, analysis of gene ontology  was used to indicate processes that are likely to be affected. different gene ontology clusters showed a relative enrichment in erk <dig> versus erk <dig> knockdown gene expression signatures. since the annotation of the zebrafish genome is the limiting factor in assigning biological functions we have focused on gene ontologies that are relatively well known and have further supported the analyses by manual annotation of our signature sets. this led for instance to the observation that the biological go-clusters "development" was significant under-represented for both erk <dig> and erk <dig> knockdown. more detailed analysis was performed using the signaling-pathway based genmapp gene map annotator and pathway profiler program. by performing complete gene expression profiles  without a fold-change cut-off in pathway analyses, we address both primary and secondary effects related to erk knockdown from a morphogenetic perspective. our observations led us to propose a model for distinct effects of erk <dig> and erk <dig> knockdown in developmental signaling processes, by effecting common as well as distinct genes . early embryo developmental processes include mesoderm formation, endoderm formation dorsal-ventral pattering, anterior-posterior patterning and gastrulation movements. to establish a mesodermal zone, next to the dorsal-ventral patterning, also induction processes occur at the animal – vegetal axis. complex signaling processes are used by the embryo to induce mesoderm, as nicely reviewed by kimelman   <cit> . based on literature data it is possible to interpret the observed gene-expression profiles and analyze the knockdown effects in the context of known signaling pathways underlying these processes .

stringent knockdown conditions, as applied in this array-based study, showed that in erk <dig> morphants the ventrally expressed patterning gene vent was down-regulated, but also the bmp inhibitory gene smurf <dig> was up-regulated, possibly responsible for inhibition of bmp signaling on the ventral side . this may lead to a dorsalization of erk <dig> knockdown embryos. surviving erk <dig> morphants showed a tailless phenotype at  <dig> and  <dig> hpf . this supports a block of bmp-signaling, as tail formation is combinatory regulated by bmp and fgf signaling since mutant embryos for bmp2b fail to form tails  <cit>  and embryos with impaired fgf-signaling show tailless phenotypes. in addition, it is important to note that also genes involved in regulating gastrulation cell migration were altered in expression   <cit> .

erk <dig> signaling is essential for the maintenance of the mesendodermal cell fates
in erk <dig> morphants no active mapk was detected at the margin at  <dig> hpf  suggesting that ras-raf-mek-erk dependent fgf signaling and subsequent downstream signaling was blocked. fgf signaling acts as a competence factor for cells to respond to nodal mediated mesoderm induction. as our data show that erk <dig> morphants are severely impaired in both fgf and wnt signaling it is likely that mesoderm progenitor cells in the margin are affected in the maintenance of the mesodermal cell fates . however, it has been reported that nodal and fgf pathways interact through a positive regulatory loop and synergize to maintain mesodermal cell populations  <cit> , in addition fgf signaling negatively regulates nodal-dependent endoderm induction in zebrafish  <cit> . this would suggest that nodal-mediated initiation of mesoderm differentiation is still present, but the maintenance of the mesoderm, mediated by fgf and wnt, is affected.

drosophila, fgf-dependent erk activation was shown to be required for proper mesoderm dispersal  <cit> . in xenopus, erk <dig> was shown to be required for mesoderm differentiation  <cit> . mouse erk2-/- embryos also fail to form mesoderm at e <dig>  and e <dig>  based on histological criteria, but erk2-/- embryonic stem cells were still capable of forming mesoderm. however, treatment of these es cells with the mapk inhibitor pd <dig> decreased total erk activity in these cells and expression of the mesoderm marker brachyury/ntl   <cit> . our gene expression profiling shows that erk <dig> plays a role in mesoderm development based on additional mesoderm markers , but importantly also by addressing the upstream signaling mechanisms involved in mesoderm initiation and maintenance. it should be noted that erk-activation is not only mediated by fgf signaling, but also influenced by other growth factors , g-protein coupled receptor signaling and hormone- and ca2+ signaling pathways. a nice example that demonstrates the complexity of interconnections, redundancy and crosstalk between the different pathways is the work of poulain et al,  showing that combinatorial nodal, fgf and bmp signaling regulates endoderm formation in zebrafish. these authors also reported that activation of fgf-signaling or injection of constitutive active  erk <dig> lead to phosphorylation of sox <dig> and repression of the endoderm marker sox <dig>  however, in our study, erk <dig> morphants showed a reduced expression of the upstream nodal responsive genes gata <dig>  sox <dig> and sox <dig>  these genes are normally expressed in presumptive endoderm progenitor cells in the margin at  <dig>  hpf  <cit> . this suggests that depletion of erk <dig> also affects endoderm differentiation . follow-up experiments, using different times of development in combination with chromatin immuno-precipitation  methodology will be needed to further understand the crucial function of erk <dig> in mesendoderm development and determine specific target genes.

CONCLUSIONS
our analysis of the gene expression microarray data revealed that erk <dig> and erk <dig> knockdown affected a set of common, as well as specific downstream genes. interestingly, we also discovered a set of genes with anti-correlated expression. the gene ontology analyses show that erk <dig> and erk <dig> have specific roles in embryogenesis and target distinct gene sets involved in vertebrate development, confirming the embryonic knockdown phenotypes. these gene sets are large and considering the early embryonic time points of analyses, most likely include many direct transcriptional targets at least at the oblong stage. at later stages we expect to have identified also several secondary effects that are due to phenotypic changes. the signaling pathway analysis on the erk <dig> and erk <dig> transcriptome signatures using the genmapp software program for analysis of bmp, fgf, nodal and wnt signaling pathways indicated distinct roles for these map kinases. for erk <dig> knockdown we identified a connection with genes involved in dorsal-ventral patterning and subsequent embryonic cell migration. for erk <dig> knockdown we identified a connection with genes involved in mesoderm and endoderm initiation, differentiation and patterning. the outcome of the predictions for erk <dig> knockdown on developmental signaling were confirmed by the observed effects on mesoderm and endoderm patterning and subsequent whole mount in situ hybridization experiments. our results demonstrate the strength of gene expression profiling of morpholino knockdown embryos in combination with versatile bioinformatics tools in order to show common functions as well as distinct functions for highly related signaling proteins such as erk <dig> and erk <dig>
