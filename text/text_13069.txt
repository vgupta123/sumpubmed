BACKGROUND
sperm adhesion molecule  <dig>  is a member of a family of at least six mammalian hyaluronidases. the genes encoding these enzymes cluster in two groups of three – spam <dig>  hyal <dig> and hyalp <dig>  on human chromosome 7q <dig>  and hyal <dig>  hyal <dig> and hyal <dig> on human chromosome 3p <dig>  <cit> . the orthologous mouse genes form similar clusters at syntenic chromosomal locations  <cit> . this suggests that two single-gene duplications, followed by a small segmental duplication, occurred before the divergence of human and mouse approximately  <dig> million years ago.

hyal <dig> exclusively degrades chondroitin. in contrast, hyal <dig>  hyal <dig>  hyal <dig> and spam <dig> hydrolyze hyaluronic acid, with different substrate size preferences and tissue specificities  <cit> . expression of spam <dig> has been unanimously reported in the testis in various species . expression has also been detected in the human epididymis, vas deferens, prostate and placenta  <cit>  and the murine epididymis, kidney, uterus, vagina and oviduct  <cit> . expression of spam <dig> has not been detected in the human female reproductive tract  <cit> .

spam <dig> has various functions in fertilization. a catalytic domain has been shown to degrade hyaluronic acid  <cit> . this molecule is a major extracellular matrix component of the cumulus cell layer that surrounds the ovum, and spam <dig> has been shown to remove this cumulus layer in vitro  <cit> . spam <dig> has hyaluronic acid and zona pellucida binding regions that are distinct from its catalytic domain  <cit>  and is also involved in an intracellular signalling pathway in sperm cells upon binding to the zona pellucida  <cit> .

the role of murine spam <dig> in fertilization has been investigated using a knockout mouse line. sperm from spam <dig> -/- mice showed a delay in the removal of the cumulus cell layer and fertilization in vitro. surprisingly, however, spam <dig> -/- males showed normal in vivo fertility rates and sired normal-sized litters  <cit> . sperm from spam <dig> -/- mice maintained 40% of the wild-type level of hyaluronidase activity, while protein expression assays indicated the presence of a second hyaluronidase in these cells  <cit> . this was unexpected, as spam <dig> was thought to be the only testicular hyaluronidase. these results may be explained by recent evidence that the murine orthologue of the human hyalp <dig> pseudogene has an intact orf and is expressed in mouse testis  <cit> , and that a seventh hyaluronidase, hyal <dig>  may exist in mouse, but not in human  <cit> . there may therefore be some redundancy among murine testicular hyaluronidases that explains the fertility of spam <dig> -/- mice. in this case, it remains likely that spam <dig> is an essential protein in human fertilization.

little is known about the transcriptional regulation of spam <dig>  a non-consensus camp response element  in the murine spam <dig> promoter bound the testis-specific cre modulator  protein and was involved in activation of spam <dig> transcription in vitro  <cit> . in addition, spam <dig> expression was abolished in crem-deficient mice  <cit> . various other putative transcription factor binding sites have been identified in the human, mouse and rat spam <dig> promoters  <cit> ; however, the sites are generally non-consensus and have not yet been shown to be functional. the restricted developmental and spatial expression of spam <dig>  <cit> , as well as the unique transcriptional mechanisms employed during spermatogenesis , may render spam <dig> unamenable to traditional methods of transcription and promoter analysis.

in a previous study by our group, spam <dig> was identified as one of the many human transcripts that contain transposable element  sequence  <cit> . tes include long and short interspersed nuclear elements , dna transposons, and endogenous retroviruses . tes are extremely common in the human and mouse genomes, and together contribute 45% and 40% of the total sequence, respectively  <cit> . many human and mouse gene transcripts contain te sequences in their untranslated regions   <cit> . tes also contribute to the transcriptional regulation of many genes. the antisense line <dig> promoter and the long terminal repeat  promoters of ervs are known to participate in the tissue-specific expression of various host genes  <cit> . through bioinformatic analysis, human and mouse spam <dig> transcripts were predicted to initiate within an antisense erv  <cit> , indicating that this gene may represent another example of transcriptional regulation by a te.

in this study, we show that the first exons and proximal promoter regions of the human and rodent spam <dig> genes are derived from an erv <dig> pol coding region, and identify novel alternative promoters and splicing variants of the gene. we show that the human and mouse erv-derived promoters are largely testis-specific, and discuss the implications of erv insertion on the evolution of transcriptional regulation at this locus.

RESULTS
the human spam <dig> gene initiates within an erv <dig> pol region
a recent study by our group used bioinformatic methods to investigate the contribution of tes to human and mouse gene transcripts  <cit> . that study determined that  <dig> % of human refseq genes initiate within a te sequence, indicating that these genes are candidates for transcriptional regulation by tes. one example identified in this way was the spam <dig> gene, where the 5'-terminus was found to map within an antisense erv element. we have now investigated this locus in more detail.

we used the university of california at santa cruz  genome browser at  to more closely examine the genomic region surrounding the first exon of spam <dig>  the region bears the hallmarks of multiple te insertions into older, pre-existing repetitive elements, resulting in a "patchwork" effect of fragmented tes from different families . the previously described spam <dig> transcriptional start site  mapped within an antisense erv <dig> element of the mer <dig> family . surprisingly, the erv sequence was derived not from an ltr, but rather from an internal retroviral region. this is counter to all previously described examples of transcription initiation within an erv. to confirm this repeatmasker annotation, we performed a blast homology search of the translated retroviral sequence against a protein database. this analysis confirmed that spam <dig> transcripts initiate within a fragment of the erv <dig> pol gene.

the alternative promoters and splicing variants of spam1
we performed 5'-rapid amplification of cdna ends  to confirm the position of the spam <dig> transcriptional start site. since expression of spam <dig> is confined largely to the testis, we used human testis rna for this analysis. sequencing of 5'-race clones identified two alternative first exons of spam <dig> . we have designated the upstream, previously-identified first exon as exon 1a, and the novel downstream first exon as exon 1b. exon 1a is wholly derived from the antisense erv <dig> pol region. exon 1b initiates within a different fragment of the same pol gene, but terminates within a sense orientation ltr of the erv <dig> mer4c family . transcripts containing both alternative first exons spliced into the same downstream exons; the spam <dig> orf begins in exon  <dig>  and is therefore not affected by alternative promoter usage .

multiple transcription start sites were identified within exon 1a, at position + <dig>  + <dig>  + <dig> and + <dig> . we also identified a splicing variant of exon 1a, with variant 1a <dig> using a splice donor site at position + <dig>  use of this alternative splice site resulted in a truncated  <dig> bp first exon, as opposed to a full-length size of  <dig> bp for variant 1a <dig> . in contrast, a single transcription start site and no splicing variants were observed for exon 1b. however, some transcripts initiating within exon 1b contained a novel alternatively-spliced  <dig> bp exon . the sequences of all human and murine spam <dig> splicing variants have been deposited in genbank with accession numbers ay <dig> – ay <dig> 

both erv-derived promoters are male-specific
to verify the expression patterns of the spam <dig> alternative promoter and splicing variants, we performed non-quantitative rt-pcr on a panel of rnas derived from normal human tissues. as shown in figure  <dig>  expression of transcripts containing spam <dig> orf sequence was detected in the testis, as well as the heart, small intestine, prostate, muscle and placenta. primers designed to amplify both exon 1a splicing variants detected transcripts only in the testis and prostate, while exon 1b-specific transcripts were detected in the testis, prostate, and to a lesser degree in the placenta. the smaller of the two splicing variants was predominant for both promoters; this may be due to an amplification bias introduced by the pcr.

we next used real-time rt-pcr to quantify the level of spam <dig> transcripts and the contribution of each alternative promoter to total gene expression. primers annealing to exon  <dig> and exon  <dig>  common to all spam <dig> transcripts , were used to determine the level of total gene expression. this value was normalized to the level of gapdh transcripts and expressed relative to that obtained for the heart, which showed a low level of spam <dig> expression . as expected, spam <dig> was highly expressed in the testis, although low levels of expression were also detected in the prostate and some other tissues.

on the basis of the results obtained with the orf-specific primers, we decided to quantify the expression of exon 1a and 1b transcripts only in the testis. to avoid amplification of different-sized products from alternatively-spliced spam <dig> transcripts, we designed forward primers that spanned two exons. the forward primer for exon 1a transcripts contained  <dig> bases that anneal to the 3'-end of truncated exon 1a <dig>  and  <dig> bases that anneal to the 5'-end of exon  <dig>  similarly, the forward primer for exon 1b transcripts contained  <dig> bases that anneal to the 3'-end of exon 1b, and  <dig> bases that anneal to the 5'-end of exon  <dig>  each forward primer was used with a reverse primer specific to the 3'-end of exon  <dig>  in this way, only the smaller of the two splicing variants originating in each first exon was amplified . the levels of transcripts detected with these primer pairs were used to calculate the contribution of each erv-derived promoter to total gene expression. as shown in figure  <dig>  exon 1a transcripts were approximately 10-fold more abundant than those initiating in exon 1b, accounting for 78% of total spam <dig> expression in the testis compared to  <dig> % for exon 1b transcripts. the 14% of spam <dig> orf transcripts not accounted for by these primer pairs most likely correspond to splicing variants 1a <dig> and 1b <dig>  which were excluded from this analysis.

a) h, human; m, mouse; g, gapdh; s, spam1; f, forward; r, reverse.

the results obtained by non-quantitative rt-pcr  and quantitative, real-time rt-pcr  were generally similar. however, transcripts containing spam <dig> orf sequence were detected in the small intestine and muscle by the former method, but not the latter. the bands amplified from these tissues by non-quantitative rt-pcr were sequenced and were confirmed to correspond to the predicted spam <dig> orf transcript. 5'-race analysis performed on human muscle total rna identified a low level of transcripts initiating within promoter 1b, but no other spam1-specific transcripts . these results suggest that the  <dig> cycles used for non-quantitative rt-pcr analysis amplified transcripts present at levels too low to be detected by real-time rt-pcr.

erv1-derived promoter 1a is conserved in the mouse genome
initial analysis of spam <dig> revealed that transcripts of the mouse orthologue, spam <dig>  also initiate within an erv  <cit> . examination of the mouse genomic sequence revealed that, as in human, the published 5'-ends of the spam <dig> first exon  map within an antisense erv <dig> mer <dig> pol region . a similar overlap between spam <dig> transcripts and an antisense erv <dig> pol region was observed in the rat genome . this erv <dig> element therefore inserted into the ancestral genome before the divergence of humans and rodents, approximately  <dig> million years ago.

the repeatmasker track of the ucsc genome browser annotated only a  <dig> bp region of the murine spam <dig> locus as erv <dig> pol sequence; the analogous pol fragment containing human spam <dig> exon 1a is considerably larger . due to the higher neutral mutation rate in mouse  <cit> , murine tes that inserted prior to the primate-rodent split are roughly twice as diverged as the orthologous human element, making detection by repeat-finding programs difficult. older elements in rodents are therefore often excluded from annotation as tes in the repeatmasker database  <cit> . we used the dotter sequence comparison program to determine whether this was the case for the erv <dig> sequence associated with spam <dig>  we extracted the human genomic dna sequence containing the full-length exon 1a <dig> and  <dig> bp of upstream sequence  from the ucsc genome browser. we also extracted the mouse genomic sequence containing exon  <dig> and  <dig> bp of upstream sequence . a dot plot showing a comparison of these two sequences is shown in figure 6a.

the sequence annotated as the erv <dig> pol region in the human genome corresponds to nucleotides  <dig> –  <dig> in figure 6a . the positions of the erv <dig> pol region and the exon 1a transcriptional start site are shown below the lower horizontal axis. the mouse genomic sequence from approximately nucleotide  <dig> –  <dig> in figure 6a shows some sequence similarity to nucleotides  <dig> - <dig> of the human sequence. therefore the region of the mouse spam <dig> locus derived from the erv <dig> pol region is considerably larger than that annotated by repeatmasker, extending approximately  <dig> bp upstream of the transcriptional start site. the positions of the annotated and extended erv <dig> pol regions are represented by solid and dashed boxes, respectively, on the right hand side of figure 6a. a similar dotter result was observed upon comparison of the corresponding rat and human genomic sequences .

the level of sequence similarity between the human and mouse spam <dig> promoter regions is highest at position  <dig> –  <dig> in the human sequence and  <dig> –  <dig> in the mouse . a sequence comparison revealed that this conserved region contains the functional cre identified in the murine spam <dig> promoter . the relatively high level of primate – rodent conservation of this element and the surrounding sequence indicates that this region may be functionally important.

we performed 5'-race on mouse testis rna to identify the transcriptional start site and to search for alternative promoters of spam <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  a single first exon with multiple transcriptional start sites was identified for spam <dig>  this exon is orthologous to exon 1a of the human gene . no sequence equivalent to human exon 1b was detected in mouse spam <dig> transcripts. two splicing variants were identified for the mouse spam <dig> gene. variant  <dig> utilized an alternative transcription start site and splice donor site within exon  <dig> to generate a truncated first exon, and spliced into a short  novel downstream exon . as with human spam <dig>  the murine splicing variants affect only the 5'-utr, leaving the downstream orf intact .

expression of the mouse spam <dig> gene is largely testis-specific
we performed non-quantitative rt-pcr on a panel of normal c57bl/ <dig> mouse tissues to determine the expression pattern of spam <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  primers specific to the spam <dig> orf detected transcripts only in the testis. transcripts initiating within the erv <dig> pol region were detected primarily in the testis, and to a lesser degree in the kidney. as with the human gene, the erv <dig> pol-derived promoter of murine spam <dig> is therefore largely testis-specific.

discussion
in this study we have experimentally confirmed a previous in silico observation  <cit>  that transcription of the human and murine spam <dig> genes initiates within an antisense erv common to both species. spam <dig> is the only hyaluronidase gene to initiate within an erv ; this te insertion therefore took place after the small segmental duplication of three ancestral hyaluronidase genes, but before the divergence of primates and rodents. interestingly, human hyal <dig>  but not its mouse orthologue, appears to initiate within an antisense line <dig> element . this element therefore inserted after the primate-rodent split, indicating an ongoing contribution by tes to human hyaluronidase transcriptional regulation.

a previous study by our group determined that te insertions were more common in transcripts with a high ka/ks value  <cit> . the ka/ks ratio for the human-old world monkey spam <dig> orthologous pair is high at  <dig>   <cit> . this is in line with our hypothesis that te insertions are more likely to be tolerated by rapidly-evolving genes  <cit> . high ka/ks ratios are a common characteristic of primate genes that are involved in male reproduction. this may be due to positive selection, driven by competition between the sperm of individual males of the more promiscuous primate species  <cit> . in the case of spam <dig>  the requirement for species-specific sperm-zona pellucida recognition may also have contributed to the high inter-species divergence of the protein sequence.

we have identified two closely-spaced erv-derived promoters for human spam <dig>  both were active primarily in the testis, albeit with an approximately 10-fold difference in promoter activity. this close physical proximity and similar tissue specificity suggests that the two promoters may be regulated by a shared testis-specific enhancer element, rather than by individual tissue-specific proximal promoter regions. we have also identified alternative splicing variants for the human and mouse genes. alternatively-spliced transcripts of hyal <dig> and hyal <dig> have been described that cause an in-frame deletion of the putative catalytic site and abolish hyaluronidase function  <cit> . evidence from the ncbi database suggests that an alternative splicing event in spam <dig> exon  <dig> generates an extended 3'-transcript, which encodes a c-terminally truncated spam <dig> isoform. however, the presence of this splicing variant has yet to be confirmed. in contrast, the alternatively-spliced transcripts of spam <dig> and spam <dig> described in this study differ only in the sequence and length of the 5'-utr, and are not predicted to affect enzyme function. changes in the 5'-utr sequence may however alter the stability and / or translation efficiency of the transcripts , and hence impact indirectly on spam <dig> expression.

we have shown that all spam <dig> / spam <dig> alternative promoter and splicing variants are expressed primarily in the testis. lower levels of expression were also observed in the human prostate and murine kidney. this contradicts previous reports that human spam <dig> is expressed in the placenta  <cit>  and that murine spam <dig> is expressed in tissues of the female reproductive tract  <cit> . expression of spam <dig> is confined to a subset of specialized cells in some tissues  <cit> , which may explain these contradictory results.

in contrast to all known examples of host gene transcriptional regulation by ervs, spam <dig> and spam <dig> initiate not within an ltr, but rather within a fragment of the pol coding region. while the spam <dig> / spam <dig> promoters have not yet been fully analyzed, a non-consensus cre at position - <dig> has been shown to be important for activity of the murine spam <dig> promoter in an in vitro testis system  <cit> . this site, and a similar sequence in the human promoter, are clearly derived from the erv <dig> pol region and are well conserved between the two species . various lines of evidence suggest that spam <dig> expression is regulated by sex hormones: the expression of spam <dig> in the male and female reproductive organs; the increased expression of spam <dig> in male kidney compared to female  <cit> ; the seasonal variation in spam <dig> expression in red fox testis  <cit> ; and the variations in murine female spam <dig> expression at different stages of estrus  <cit> . indeed, various groups have identified putative androgen response elements  in the spam <dig> and spam <dig> promoters  <cit> , and estrogen response elements  in the spam <dig> promoter  <cit> . many of these predicted sites also map within the erv pol region. however, none of these sequences represents a consensus binding site, and none has yet been shown to bind its cognate transcription factor or to be required for spam <dig> expression.

alternatively, hormonal regulation may be mediated through the cre. androgen treatment of sertoli cells was recently shown to rapidly induce phosphorylation of a cre binding protein and activate transcription of target genes via the mapk pathway  <cit> . this mechanism was postulated to represent a common mechanism for activation of testis-specific promoters that do not contain a consensus are. much work remains to be done to elucidate the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of spam <dig> and spam <dig>  however, it is clear that at least one functional transcription factor binding site is derived from the erv <dig> pol region.

erv ltrs contain the regulatory signals necessary for transcription of the retroviral genes. insertion of an ltr sequence near a host gene could therefore provide a novel, pre-formed regulatory unit and be rapidly adopted by the gene for use as an alternative promoter. it is less clear how a retroviral protein coding region, which has no known function in transcriptional regulation, could be adopted for use as a promoter by a host gene. we suggest the following scenario.

prior to the primate-rodent divergence, an erv inserted upstream of the ancestral spam <dig> gene, in the antisense orientation. by chance, the antisense pol coding region contained sequences that were similar to a cre, and possibly to other transcription factor binding sites necessary for testis-specific transcription. the region of the human spam <dig> promoter that contains the cre is quite divergent from the mer <dig> consensus sequence . it is therefore unlikely that the cre was functional, and hence preserved by purifying selection, from the time of erv insertion. the cre present in the modern spam <dig> and spam <dig> promoters is more likely to have evolved by random nucleotide substitution from a similar sequence in the original antisense pol gene. the ~ <dig> bp of genomic sequence that contains the cre is relatively well conserved between human and rodents , indicating that purifying selection of this sequence probably occurred at some time after the creation of the functional cre. the evolutionary origins of other functional transcription factor binding sites in the modern spam <dig> / spam <dig> promoters remain to be determined.

the selective processes driving the evolution of a promoter from a protein coding sequence, and the fate of the original ancestral spam <dig> promoter, remain unknown. this gene therefore represents an extremely intriguing example of how the host genome can adopt "parasitic" erv sequences for its own purposes.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that transcription of the human and mouse spam <dig> genes initiates within an antisense erv pol gene. the first exons and proximal promoters of both genes are derived from this ancient erv pol sequence. expression of the human and mouse spam <dig> genes is largely testis-specific, and we have provided evidence that testis-specific transcription factor binding sites are derived from conserved erv sequence in both species. spam <dig> can therefore be added to the growing list of mammalian genes that are regulated by tes. this gene represents the first known example of the evolution of promoter function from an erv coding sequence, and of gender-specific transcription from an erv-derived promoter.
