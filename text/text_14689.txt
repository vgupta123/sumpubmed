BACKGROUND
spermatogenesis consists of three phases: mitotic division of spermatogonia, meiotic division of spermatocytes and cellular transformation of haploid gametes during spermiogenesis. the final phase requires quite striking cellular reorganization to produce functional sperm including biogenesis of spermatid specific organelles and structures such as the acrosome and microtubule manchette, removal of excess cytoplasm, and streamlining of the spermatid nucleus into its final shape  <cit> . these unique forms of intracellular motility are expected to require specific adaptations of the spermatid cytoskeleton and associated molecular motor proteins  <cit> . we have identified a kinesin-related molecular motor, kifc <dig>  a c-terminal motor and member of the kinesin- <dig> subfamily  <cit> , associated with the spermatid nucleus during the morphological changes of spermiogenesis  <cit> . this molecular motor is first seen adjacent to the round spermatid nucleus in early spermatids of approximately step 1– <dig> and then migrates to the nuclear surface and the growing acrosome of step 7– <dig> spermatids  <cit> . in more elongate spermatids, kifc <dig> locates near the spermatid manchette, a spermatid-specific microtubule structure thought to be important for spermatid nuclear shaping  <cit>  and redistribution of cytoplasm .

previous work identified a  <dig> amino acid sequence in the tail domain of kifc <dig> that is necessary and sufficient to target this motor to membranous structures in cultured cells  <cit> . furthermore, we have shown recently that this domain assembles a complex containing the nucleoporin nup <dig> in testis lysate  <cit> . the localization of this molecular motor near the nucleus of elongating spermatids and its association with proteins of the nuclear membrane makes kifc <dig> an excellent candidate for participation in the unique transformation of the nucleus that occurs during spermiogenesis. we have utilized the targeting sequence of kifc <dig> to identify interacting proteins in the testis that may be important for this process. we describe here the identification of a testis-specific leucine-rich repeat protein that contains a docking site for pp <dig> and is localized near the nucleus of developing spermatids.

RESULTS
a leucine-rich repeat protein interacts with the kifc <dig> targeting sequence
in an effort to identify proteins associated with the kifc <dig> targeting domain, we used the  <dig> amino acid targeting sequence as bait to screen a mouse testis cdna library using a yeast 2-hybrid approach  <cit> . approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> independent clones were screened for induction of transcription of three genes  by bait-prey interaction. of the  <dig> positive clones identified,  <dig> were identical and contained an open reading frame for an uncharacterized protein previously identified in a mouse adult testis cdna library . the approximately  <dig> kd predicted open reading frame contains  <dig> leucine rich repeats  in the n-terminal half of the molecule  and was therefore named testis leucine rich repeat, or tlrr. three of the lrrs match the consensus repeat domain previously described for the sds <dig> subfamily of lrr proteins while the other is a slight variation   <cit> . the tlrr protein demonstrates 15% sequence identity and 27% homology to ppp1r <dig> , the mouse homolog of yeast sds22p  <cit> , a regulator of pp1; however, the homology is greatest in the regions containing the llr domains. sequence analysis revealed a variant of the consensus binding site for pp <dig>  x1x <dig>  in the carboxyl half of the polypeptide  <cit>  .

tlrr is expressed in the testis
to determine whether tlrr is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, we tested for the presence of tlrr mrna in various mouse tissues. tlrr is highly and, of the tissues we tested, exclusively expressed in the testis , a pattern consistent with its assigned unigene cluster at the ncbi, mm. <dig>  even upon longer exposure, no signal is detected in the other tissues examined. two tlrr variants have been entered into available databases , perhaps explaining the diffuse nature of the band at around  <dig>  kb. interestingly, the shorter variant stops just after the last lrr and therefore does not contain the predicted pp <dig> binding site.

in order to detect the tlrr protein in tissue lysates and in sections, an anti-peptide polyclonal antibody was prepared specific for the tlrr protein . the tlrr specific antibody recognizes a  <dig> kd band only in testis lysate, a size that matches the predicted orf of the interacting clone . no protein of this size is detected with the tlrr antibody in the other tissues examined. a  <dig> kd band is evident in brain but is also recognized by preimmune serum  and therefore likely represents a nonspecific epitope enriched in this tissue. no signal was visible in epididymal sperm lysate, even at longer exposures, suggesting that tlrr may be discarded during spermatogenesis.

interaction of tlrr with kifc <dig> requires all lrrs
in order to determine whether any or all of the lrrs in this protein contribute to it's binding to kifc <dig>  we constructed deletion mutants of tllr followed by detection of protein interaction by yeast 2-hybrid. fragments expressing portions of the tlrr  <dig> kd open reading frame were transferred from one of the original clones  to padt <dig> for expression in yeast . each construct was cotransformed with the kifc <dig> bait plasmid into ah <dig> and protein interaction tested by growth on selective media containing x-α-gal. only the original clone , the complete open reading frame , and a construct containing sequences 5' to the putative atg in addition to the lrrs, were able to support transcriptional activation in yeast . constructs containing less than the full complement of lrrs  as well as those containing all four lrrs but truncated at either the amino  or carboxyl  where unable to transactivate. this suggests that all  <dig> lrr sequences are necessary but not sufficient for interaction with kifc <dig>  surprisingly, the construct containing the  <dig> lrrs  but containing coding sequence upstream of the putative atg was able to activate transcription, perhaps indicating that the conformation of this construct  is more favorable for interaction than tlrrd. β-gal assays of liquid cultures of each yeast cotransformant are consistent with the plate assays .

tlrr is specifically associated with the kifc <dig> targeting sequence
we have previously used an affinity approach to purify testis proteins associated with the kifc <dig> targeting domain and have shown that the rat tlrr protein is specifically bound to the kifc <dig> affinity column  <cit> . we next wanted to determine whether mouse tlrr is specifically associated with the kifc <dig> affinity column. in order to detect the tlrr protein in fractions bound to the affinity column we used our affinity purified tlrr antibody. this antibody reacts with a  <dig> kd band in testis lysate  and with recombinant tlrr expressed in bacteria . the tlrr specific antibody also recognizes a faster migrating band in testis lysate that could result from a shorter tlrr isoform, or could be due to proteolysis. no reactive band in testis was detected when the blot was probed with preimmune serum . testis lysate was incubated with the kifc <dig> targeting peptide linked to resin and proteins present in the flow-through and eluted fractions were resolved by page and visualized by staining and western blot with tlrr specific antibody . a subset of lysate proteins was found to associate with the kifc <dig> peptide and was eluted with low ph  or low ph plus nacl . a band reactive to the tlrr antibody is detected in the low ph plus salt elution .

tlrr is localized to germ cells in the testis
the tlrr specific antibody was used to localize this protein in mouse testis sections. the tlrr antibody stains developing spermatids on or near the manchette  at different developmental stages. in early spermatids, when the manchette first appears, tlrr is localized adjacent to the spermatid nucleus . in the more mature spermatids shown in figure 5c and 5c' , tlrr is found near the manchette . just prior to dissolution of the manchette, in approximately step  <dig> spermatids, tlrr still resides near the manchette but has narrowed along with this structure . the tlrr antibody does not appear to stain the entire manchette but instead is restricted to a subdomain near the perinuclear ring. in addition to spermatid staining, we noted nuclear rim staining in pachytene spermatocytes . only background signal was detectable in sections incubated without primary antibody .

in order to determine the relative localization of tlrr on the spermatid nucleus with respect to the acrosome, testis sections were triple stained with tlrr antibody, dapi and a fitc conjugated lectin, peanut agglutinin . tlrr was first observed on the nuclear surface, opposite the acrosome in elongating spermatids of step 8– <dig> , followed by limited spreading over the distal portion of the nucleus at the position occupied by the manchette, in later spermatids of about step  <dig> . no signal was detected when the primary antibody was replaced with normal rabbit igg .

discussion
testis leucine rich repeat, or tlrr, was identified as a protein interacting with the  <dig> amino acid targeting sequence of the kifc <dig> molecular motor in a testis cdna library. tlrr contains  <dig> leucine rich repeats  in its amino terminus. lrrs are 20– <dig> residue sequence motifs that are predicted to form a horseshoe shaped structure with internal paired β-sheets and external helices. lrr containing proteins are proposed to function in many different biological processes by providing a versatile structural framework for protein-protein interactions . the lrr sequences in tlrr most closely match those found in sds <dig>  a regulatory subunit of pp <dig> in yeast  <cit> . indeed, tlrr contains a consensus-binding site for pp <dig> in its carboxyl terminal domain . pp <dig> is a key serine/threonine phosphatase that controls an extremely wide variety of biological processes. in contrast to mammalian kinases which are represented by many genes, the catalytic subunit of pp <dig>  is encoded by just three genes in rodents: pp1α, pp1β/δ and ppγ  <cit> . the functional diversity of pp <dig> is achieved by interaction of the catalytic subunit with a variety of regulatory subunits that serve to modulate the activity of this enzyme and target it to the correct intracellular location and/or substrate . tlrr is a good candidate for a testis-specific regulator of pp <dig> and may participate in regulation of the cellular transformations of spermiogenesis.

most pp <dig> isoforms are expressed in a variety of tissues, except for pp1γ <dig>  which is expressed primarily in testis  <cit> . pp <dig> isoforms are differentially expressed in male germ cells and mature spermatozoa  <cit>  and one isoform, pp1γ <dig>  is essential for male fertility  <cit> . the mammalian homolog of sds <dig> associates with pp1γ <dig> in bull spermatozoa where it negatively regulates the activity of this enzyme thereby modulating protein phosphorylation and sperm motility  <cit> . in contrast to sds <dig>  we cannot detect tlrr in sperm lysate suggesting that tlrr does not play a role in regulating flagellar motility. besides its presence in the flagella of mature sperm, pp1γ <dig> is present in differentiating germ cells including secondary spermatocytes, and round and elongating spermatids where it has been suggested to play a role in the morphogenesis of these cells  <cit> . tlrr is also expressed in these cell types, however, tlrr is localized near the spermatid nucleus and manchette , whereas pp1γ <dig> is expressed throughout the cytoplasm  <cit> .

the manchette is a microtubule based structure that is unique to developing male germ cells. it forms around the nucleus of approximately step  <dig> spermatids and disappears by step  <dig>  although it has been studied for many years  <cit> , its precise function and particularly the regulation of its motility along the nucleus are not completely understood. disruption of the manchette by genetic or chemical means results in distortion of the underlying spermatid nucleus, suggestive of a role for the manchette in nuclear shaping  <cit> . the manchette has also been proposed to act as a track for the transport of cellular components from the apical to the distal end of the elongating spermatid and as a platform for the localization of signaling molecules  <cit> . the manchette is present at an optimal temporal and spatial position to provide a site for the assembly of signaling complexes necessary for regulation of the dramatic morphological transformation of the spermatid. several potential regulatory proteins have been localized to the manchette including rangtpase  <cit> , a testis specific serine/threonine kinase  <cit> , and ndp kinase  <cit> . we present evidence here that a candidate regulatory subunit of pp <dig> is also localized to this structure.

CONCLUSIONS
the work presented here supports the idea that tlrr is a testis specific regulatory subunit of pp <dig> that might serve to target pp <dig> and perhaps other regulatory molecules to the nucleus of developing spermatids. tlrr is expressed primarily in the testis where it is localized near the manchette of developing spermatids, perhaps via its association with the microtubule motor kifc1; both proteins are present at the same time and in a similar pattern on the spermatid nucleus  <cit> . tlrr is homologous to other pp <dig> regulatory subunits and contains a binding site for pp <dig>  it will be important to determine whether tlrr physically associates with pp <dig>  whether this association is isoform specific and whether tlrr is able to regulate the activity of this enzyme.
