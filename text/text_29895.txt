BACKGROUND
the secretion of extracellular proteins is very important to the natural saprophytic lifestyle of aspergillus niger. the inherent ability of efficient protein secretion, found among several aspergillus species such as a. niger  and a. oryzae, has led to their biotechnological exploitation as hosts for homologous and heterologous protein production  <cit> . as protein yields for heterologous proteins are often reported as low, efforts have been made in order to describe and understand the processes that limit their secretion  <cit> , as well as efforts to prevent proteolytic activity outside the cell  <cit> .

secretory proteins begin their journey by entering the endoplasmic reticulum  where they are assembled, folded and modified. then, they are packed into copii coated vesicles and transported into the golgi-like structures where further modifications take place. proteins destined for secretion are packed into secretory vesicles to be transported to the tip of the growing hyphae, where the proteins are released extracellularly  <cit> . among the factors that disturb efficient secretion of heterologous proteins is the mis-folding of these proteins in the er and the consequence that those proteins are recognized as mis-folded by the quality control system present in the er  <cit> . the presence or accumulation of aberrant proteins in the er may become fatal to the cell and to deal with the presence of mis-folded proteins in the er, eukaryotic cells react with the expression of several genes related to protein folding and degradation, a response termed the unfolded protein response   <cit> . the basic sensing pathway to detect er stress or an increase in folding load is highly conserved from yeast to man. in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the sensor protein is ire1p which is an er-resident trans-membrane protein that contains a luminal domain that functions as the sensor of the folded state of the proteins, and has a site-specific endoribonuclease  domain at the cytoplasmic c-terminus  <cit> . the accumulation of unfolded proteins is sensed through a dynamic interaction between ire1p and the chaperone kar2p   <cit>  or by direct sensing by ire1p  <cit> . as bip/kar2p is recruited to help with the folding of the er accumulating proteins, its release from ire1p leads to the oligomerization of ire1p proteins. in turn, the formed ire1p oligomer is activated by autophosphorylation and the rnase domain is responsible for the splicing of a  <dig> nt intron present in mrna of the bzip transcription factor hac1p , a process well characterized in fungi  <cit>  and higher eukaryotes  <cit> . alternatively, from the known structures of the yeast and human lumenal and cytoplasmic domains of ire1p, a model for direct binding of ire1p to unfolded proteins has been postulated that leads to structural changes in ire1p, oligomerization and activation of the kinase and endoribonuclease domains  <cit> . in a. niger , the haca mrna splicing event results in the excision of a  <dig> nt intron  <cit> , releasing it from a translational block  <cit> . although it has not yet been shown in the s. cerevisiae or mammalian homologues, in addition to the intron splicing, the haca mrna of a. niger aspergillus nidulans and trichoderma reesei is truncated at the 5’-end during upr induction  <cit> . however, mulder and nikolaev  <cit>  showed that in a. niger  truncation of haca is not a requirement for induction of the pathway. once translated, haca migrates into the nucleus where it binds to palindromic upr elements at the promoter regions of upr targets  <cit> . transcriptome analysis under upr inducing conditions in both fungi and mammalian cells has revealed the induced expression of subsets of genes involved in folding, secretion, phospholipid biosynthesis and protein degradation  <cit> . most of the upr studies performed have induced this pathway through the presence of harsh chemicals , which by itself may impose collateral responses that might provoke er stress, and by expressing heterologous proteins such as tpa and chymosin  <cit> . however, a recent study has illustrated that the induction of upr-target genes may not be a stress response only induced by the presence of mis-folded proteins, but may represent a more physiologically natural mechanism required and induced under conditions where there is a demand for an increased secretion capacity  <cit> .

manipulation of the upr pathway and its components, like bip <dig> and pdi  <cit> , has been a common approach to improve the secreted production of heterologous proteins. valkonen et al.  <cit>  have shown, in s. cerevisiae, that controlling hac1p expression has effects on native and foreign protein production; hac <dig> deletion led to a decrease of heterologous α-amylase and endoglucanase production whereas overexpression of this transcription factor resulted in an increase in the production of these proteins when compared to the respective parental strains. similar results have been demonstrated in a. niger  var awamori, where a constitutive induction of the upr pathway enhanced the production of heterologous laccase and of bovine preprochymosin  <cit> . the upr is activated to alleviate the stress caused by the accumulation of mis-folded protein in the er lumen by improving protein folding, degrading unwanted proteins  <cit>  and reducing the entry of secretory proteins into the er, a mechanism known as repression under secretion stress   <cit> . studies have shown that there is a selective down-regulation of genes coding extracellular enzymes in the presence of chemicals which inhibit protein folding  <cit> .

in this study, we present a genome-wide overview of the haca responsive genes by comparing the transcriptomic profiles of two genetically engineered a. niger  strains expressing either the wild-type haca gene or the active form of the haca transcription factor. the comparison suggests haca as a master regulator, coordinating several processes within the secretory pathway such as the induction of protein folding, protein glycosylation and intracellular transport. additionally, we discovered that constitutive activation of haca results in the down regulation of the amyr transcription factor and the amyr regulon, which includes the most abundantly produced extracellular glycoproteins, thereby reducing import of new proteins into the er. the down-regulation of the amyr regulon revealed by the genome wide expression analysis was phenotypically confirmed as the hacaca mutant displayed a strongly reduced growth phenotype on starch plates.

RESULTS
construction and analysis of a strain expressing a constitutively activated form of haca
to obtain an a. niger  strain with a constitutively activated haca  transcription factor, the wild-type haca gene was replaced by the spliced form of haca that lacks the  <dig> nucleotide intron. for the construction of a reference strain and a strain only expressing the haca induced form, plasmids phacwt and phacca were used . transformants with the correct integration pattern for each plasmid were selected after southern blot analysis  and the absence of the intron was confirmed in the hacaca strain . growth assays were performed with both strains at different temperatures . at each temperature tested, radial growth rate  of the hacaca strain was reduced compared to the hacawt strain, and this growth impairment was more pronounced at  <dig> and 42 °c . differences in phenotype between both strains were also apparent as hacaca showed a delay in growth and conidiation in comparison to hacawt . as no phenotypic differences were found between our reference strain hacawt and n <dig> , we conclude that the phenotypic effects observed in hacaca are due to the presence of only the upr-induced form of haca. the effects of having a constitutive activation of the upr are different from the absence of a functional upr. the deletion of the haca transcription factor in a. niger  has a profound effect on growth and morphology of the fungus, resulting in smaller and more compact colonies that hardly form conidia  <cit> .

physiological consequences of the constitutive haca activation in batch cultivations
growth of batch cultures of the a. niger  hacawt and hacaca strains was characterized as filamentous and highly reproducible. the growth kinetics of a representative culture of each strain is shown in figure  <dig> and results from all cultures are given in the supplemental material [additional file  <dig>  cultures of the hacawt strain exhibited exponential growth with a specific growth rate  of  <dig>  ± <dig>  h- <dig>  from exit of lag phase to depletion of glucose . initial growth of hacaca was similar to that of the hacawt; it was exponential with a μ of  <dig>  ± <dig>  h- <dig> . however, after 21–22 h of batch cultivation, when half of the glucose was consumed, the growth kinetics shifted from exponential to apparently linear . it was not clear from the relatively few determinations of biomass concentration whether growth was truly linear in the second phase but this was strongly supported by analysis of the growth-dependent alkali addition . we established a concordance between growth and alkali added to maintain constant ph in the cultures , and used this as an indirect measure of growth as described previously by iversen et al.  <cit> . linearity was then confirmed by log-transformation of alkali addition rates using the computer recorded titrant addition data and the los program  <cit> . during exponential growth, growth yield on substrate  was comparable in both strains:  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for hacawt and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for hacaca.

impact of the constitutive activation of haca on the transcriptome of a. niger 
three independent bioreactor cultures with the hacawt strain were performed. from each cultivation experiment, biomass was harvested from the mid-exponential growth phase ) and used for rna extraction and subsequent microarray analysis . likewise, for the hacaca strain three bioreactor cultivations were performed and biomass was harvested from each culture and rna was isolated from the mid-exponential time point  . global transcription profiles were determined in triplicate for mid-exponential growth phase of hacawt strain cultures and at the corresponding biomass concentration for the hacaca strain cultures, represented by the arrows in figure 2a and 2b. for the hacaca cultures, rna was extracted from two additional time points subsequent to the shift to linear growth and the rna was also analyzed  . thus, the data set in this study consists of four groups of triplicate biological replicates of hacawt and hacaca at three time points . the reproducibility of triplicate array analyses was high with a mean coefficient of variation  ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for transcripts rated as present or marginal.

the number of differentially-expressed genes  in a pair-wise comparison are given in table  <dig>  in response to constitutive activation of haca at time point  <dig> ,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed. the number of differentially expressed genes increased when comparing the later time points  to the wild-type strain to give a total number of  <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed genes. table  <dig> also shows that the transcriptomic differences between the different time points of the constitutive haca strain were relatively minor . comparison of hacaca- <dig> with hacaca- <dig> revealed very similar transcriptomes and with the stringent fdr of < <dig> , no differentially expressed genes were detected. as a start to analyse the expression data, venn diagrams were made to identify genes that were differentially expressed in hacaca at all three time points when compared to the wild-type strain. as shown in figure 3a,  <dig> genes were up-regulated in the constitutive haca strain at all three time points and  <dig> genes were down-regulated . a complete list of all expression data and the fdr-values for the pair-wise comparison of the different strains and time points is given in .

↑ up-regulated; ↓ down-regulated.

from the  <dig> up-regulated genes [additional file  <dig> we were able to retrieve  <dig> upstream regions. these upstream regions were analysed for the presence of upre sequences ntgt/gcct-3’,  <cit> ). from the up-regulated genes in the hacaca strain, we found  <dig> genes that contained at least one upre sequence within the 400 bp region up-stream their start codon [additional file  <dig>  compared to the frequency of upre in the 400 bp up-stream region of the remaining non up-regulated genes  a statistical significant enrichment  was assessed with the fisher's exact test . although this analysis indicates a statistical enrichment for genes containing a haca binding site in the promoter region of haca induced genes, it shows that only about 10% of the hacaca induced genes contain a putative haca binding site. it suggests that either the currently used haca binding consensus site is too stringent and that additional sequences allow haca to bind, or that additional transcription factors are involved in the induction in response to the constitutive activation of haca. the data set of haca induced genes with a putative upre site include genes related to protein folding , lipid metabolism, transport within the cell, glycosylation, er quality control as well as a large set of genes that code for hypothetical and unknown function proteins [additional file  <dig> 

identification of biological processes enriched in the transcriptomic profiles of the hacaca strain
to obtain an overview of the processes affected at the transcriptional level between the hacawt and the hacaca- <dig> mutant, overrepresented go-terms among differentially expressed genes were identified. for this analysis, we used the fisher's exact test gene ontology annotation tool   <cit> . network maps of related go-terms , over- or under-represented in the hacaca strain, are given in additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  in additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  the results of the go-enrichment analysis are given. to analyse the results, two complementary approaches were taken. firstly, we rationally defined go-terms of higher order that include several go-terms. secondly, we looked specifically at go-terms that are terminal in the network, as these annotations are the most detailed . these approaches enabled us to identify four major categories of genes to describe the most relevant up-regulated biological processes in the hacaca strain . the four main categories of genes included those related to i) er translocation and protein folding [additional file  <dig>  ii) intracellular vesicle trafficking [additional file  <dig>  iii) protein glycosylation [additional file  <dig> and iv) lipid metabolism [additional file  <dig>  these four main categories are further described in the following section.

in the hacaca strain we found enriched go-terms linked to er processes, such as those related to entry in the er: signal particle recognition, cleavage of signal sequence, and translocation . in addition to the processes that mediate the recognition, targeting and entering of proteins into the er, enriched go-terms also included a large number of genes involved in the subsequent events of protein folding and quality control. the genes related to protein folding included the well known haca targets such as bipa pdia tiga  and prpa  <cit> . after being synthesized and folded properly in the er, proteins are packed in vesicles and transported to the golgi and from there on, further transported to reach their final intra- or extra-cellular destination. our analysis identified a number of genes that encode proteins that take part in the vesicle/trafficking machinery such as those involved in er-to-golgi , golgi-to-er  and golgi to endosome transport. additionally, genes involved in exocytosis were also induced . go-terms related to processes involving protein glycosylation, were up-regulated in the hacaca strain. the processes include genes involved in sugar nucleotide synthesis, oligosaccharyl synthesis  and transfer  of the preassembled oligosaccharide to certain asparagine residues . in addition, genes related to the addition of o-glycans  were up-regulated. finally, several genes related to the synthesis and transfer of glycosylphosphatidylinositol  anchors to proteins were found to be up-regulated. additional file  <dig> lists the differentially expressed genes with a proposed function in relation to protein glycosylation or gpi-anchor attachment. in addition, the constitutive activation of haca has a pronounced effect on the transcription of genes involved in phospholipid metabolism and includes proteins that are homologous to proteins involved in ergosterol biosynthesis as well as proteins involved in the metabolism of fatty acids and inositol [additional file  <dig>  categories containing fewer go-terms included terms related to intracellular ph regulation and terms related to glutathione catabolic processes [additional file  <dig> 

concerning the biological processes over-represented in the down-regulated set of genes we found one major category linked to the central metabolic pathways . this category includes genes within glycolysis/gluconeogenesis; alcohol catabolic/metabolic process; carboxylic acid cycle and carbon metabolic/catabolic metabolism. categories containing fewer go-terms included terms related to transporters and response to oxidative stress. the down-regulation of genes in central metabolic pathways may reflect the growth limitation observed in the hacaca mutant .

common and different features of the constitutive activation of haca and the upr induction by chemicals or heterologous protein expression
to gain a broader overview of the impact of a constitutive activation of haca on a. niger  we compared our data set  with the data of guillemette and co-workers  in which the genome-wide transcriptional protein secretion-related stress responses was analyzed. in this study  <cit> , transcriptional targets of the upr pathway were identified by treatment of a. niger  with the er-disturbing chemical agents tunicamycin and dithiothreitol  and using a strain producing the recombinant tissue plasminogen activator  as a model for heterologous protein production. as shown in figure  <dig>  in the induced set of genes,  <dig> genes are commonly unregulated in both studies  and  <dig> genes are differentially expressed in hacaca-1/hacawt in at least two of the three conditions performed by guillemette et al.  <cit> . these  <dig> commonly induced genes include all the genes identified in the guillemette et al.’ study related to protein folding, translocation/signal peptidase complex and glycosylation and most of the genes that belong to the categories of vesicle trafficking and lipid metabolism [additional file  <dig>  however, more genes belonging to each of these categories have been identified in the hacaca-1/hacawt comparison . unique genes found in at least two of the conditions tested  and not in our data set relate mainly to the categories of cellular transport, stress related, amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and unclassified genes.

for the repressed set of genes we found  <dig> common genes to our study and guillemette et al.  <cit>  which are evenly distributed throughout the categories established by the authors . the fact that the number of commonly down-regulated genes is small between the two studies suggests important differences and heterogeneous responses to the induction of the upr indirectly  and the manipulation of the transcription factor that regulates this pathway in the overall cell metabolism.

the constitutive activation of haca triggers the induction of erad genes
secretory proteins that fail to fold properly usually accumulate in the er and are sooner or later targeted to destruction by the proteasome, a process termed er-associated degradation   <cit> . genes encoding proteins that are putatively involved in erad have been identified in the a. niger  genome  <cit>  and the expression of these genes was examined in the microarray data set. as highlighted in table  <dig>  the expression of several putative erad components was induced in the hacaca mutant. for instance, the der <dig> homologue , involved in transport of unfolded proteins out of the er  <cit> , is  <dig> -fold induced; hrd <dig> , involved in recognition and presentation of the substrate for degradation  <cit> , is  <dig> -fold induced. the mifa  gene, a homologue of mammalian herp1/mif <dig> protein and suggested as the link between the upr and erad pathways  <cit> , is  <dig> -fold induced. furthermore, mns <dig> , a mannosidase that by removal of  <dig>  α-mannose units targets the substrate to degradation  <cit> , is  <dig> -fold induced. in comparison to travers et al.  <cit> , our study allowed us to unravel the regulation of other erad related genes in relation to upr, such as mns1mif <dig>  a dsk <dig> homologue an08g <dig>  putatively encoding a ubiquitin-like protein)  and another putative α-mannosidase .

constitutive activation of haca leads to the down-regulation of the amyr regulon
although an increase in expression of secretion related processes  is observed in the hacaca strain, the expression of several genes encoding secreted proteins is down-regulated [additional file  <dig>  in addition, expression of the amyr transcription factor was repressed under these conditions . starch is a polymeric carbon source consisting of glucose units joined together by alpha <dig> - and alpha <dig> -glycosidic bonds and naturally synthesized by plants. a. niger  is able to degrade starch by secreting various amylases that convert starch into maltose and glucose  <cit> . the transcription of these amylolytic enzymes is mediated by amyr  <cit> . the amyr regulon has been defined and consists of several alpha-glucosidases as well as two sugar transporters  <cit> . our transcriptome profiles show that the enzymes and sugar transporters in the amyr regulon are commonly down-regulated .

*not significantly differentially expressed.

the down-regulation of genes involved in starch degradation and uptake suggested that the hacaca mutant’s growth may be severely affected on starch as sole carbon source. in order to test this, we performed growth tests of hacaca together with hacawt and a Δamyr strain in which the amyr-encoding gene has been deleted  <cit>  on solid media containing starch or its derivatives in a range of different complexity .

as predicted from the transcriptomic data and similar to the Δamyr strain, hacaca was unable to grow on the plate containing starch as sole carbon source. with the aim of testing if this reduced growth was specific for growth on starch or if it would apply to other complex carbohydrates, we performed a similar test on other polymers, inulin, xylan and pectin and respective monomeric substrates, fructose, xylose and galacturonic acid . in addition, growth of the hacaca strain was analysed on milk-plates . these results show that the hacaca strain is growth impaired when challenged to assimilate nutrients from complex substrates. although this was not so evident when grown on inulin, growth of the hacaca strain was clearly further reduced on xylan, pectin and milk-plates suggesting that the down-regulation of extracellular enzyme expression is not limited to the amylolytic genes, but also for xylanolytic, pectinolytic and proteolytic genes.

discussion
genome-wide gene expression variations upon constitutive activation of haca
using a defined a. niger  strain bearing a constitutively active form of haca , the key regulator of the upr pathway in eukaryotic cells, together with affymetrix genechips technology, we have defined a large set of haca-responsive genes. unlike other studies, in which the haca mrna splicing is stimulated by the presence of unfolded proteins in the er by chemicals or by expression of heterologous proteins  <cit> , we used a different approach by creating a strain lacking the  <dig> nt intron in the haca gene. to minimize additional effects of expressing the constitutive form of haca, the hacaca gene was targeted to its endogenous locus. this contrasts to previous studies in which the constitutive haca was expressed from a highly-expressed promoter  <cit>  or expressed from the pyrg locus  <cit> . the microarray data revealed, even under stringent criteria , a large number of differentially-expressed genes  upon haca activation . the transcriptomic data obtained in our study reflects the consequences of a constitutive activation of the haca transcription factor that results in the induction of many genes associated with the secretory pathway  and related to er translocation, glycosylation, folding, quality control, erad, gpi anchor biosynthesis, vesicle-mediated transport between organelles , lipid metabolism, endocytosis and vacuolar sorting. because of the highly defined conditions , this study revealed new categories of differentially-expressed genes as well as a much larger number of genes related to each category. our data are however consistent with previous upr-related studies in fungal and mammalian cells where many secretory functions are up-regulated by hac proteins, either directly or indirectly  <cit> .

our results from the transcriptomic study also revealed that constitutive activation had a negative effect on central metabolism as well as on the production of extracellular enzymes. although a clear growth reduction was observed for the hacaca strain on milk-plates , none of the main extracellular proteases )  <cit>  was shown to be transcriptionally down-regulated under the bioreactor growth conditions  . possibly, the effect of downregulation of these enzymes in the hacaca strain is only occurring during inducing conditions, which might explain the reduced growth on milk-plates. the expression level of prtt, which encodes the transcriptional activator of extracellular proteases  <cit>  was significantly down-regulated in the hacaca strain , but this has apparently no effect of the four target genes indicated above.

as the global mechanisms for energy generation and cell development are arrested or directed towards up-regulation of the protein secretion machinery, this might account for the unbalanced growth observed in hacaca in comparison to the hacawt . these results suggest an implication for heterologous protein production if the protein causes er stress. studies on increasing heterologous protein production by enhancing upr targets are contradictory and vary according to the protein expressed. although protein-specific effects are likely, most studies were not controlled for the levels of chaperones or foldases co-expressed and it has been shown that there is an optimum level of both bipa  <cit>  and pdia  <cit> .

go-enrichment analysis on the induced set of genes showed that all the well-known upr target genes related to folding are represented in the hacaca data set, and include genes encoding the chaperone bipa, and homologues of lhs1p , p58pk  and scj1p , as well as the protein disulfide isomerases pdia, prpa and tiga . glycosylation also appeared as one of the enriched categories. several aspects of protein glycosylation including the categories of oligosaccharide-lipid assembly, oligosaccharyl transferase complex, udp-glucose transport, o-linked glycosylation and gpi anchor biosynthesis , were up-regulated indicating that the cell responds to er stress by increasing the capacity to glycosylate proteins. the induction of genes associated with lipid metabolism [additional file  <dig> suggests a proliferation of the er to bear the increase of proteins that reside in this organelle, as also indicated in upr studies of s. cerevisiae  <cit> .

the elimination of unfolded proteins from the er involves the erad pathway  <cit> . travers et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that up-regulation of erad-related genes in s. cerevisiae is part of the upr. these erad genes include der <dig> and hrd <dig>  ubc <dig>  the ubiquitin-related doa <dig>  the proteasome-related pex <dig> and translocon-related sec <dig>  <cit> . from the erad components defined in a. niger  <cit> ,  <dig> out of  <dig> genes are induced in the hacaca strain . furthermore, analysis of the 400 bp of the up-stream regions of dera , sec <dig>  and an04g <dig>  revealed that these genes contain at least one upre sequence [additional file  <dig>  these results support the connection between the two pathways, as previously suggested  <cit> , although the mechanistic connection between the two pathways is unresolved. we compared our data sets with those in guillemette et al.  <cit>  and found broad agreement with a wide range of up-regulated genes under er stress conditions. however, guillemette et al.  <cit>  showed trigger-specific responses that do not complicate our analyses with hacaca. additionally, we find several putative translation initiation factors [additional file  <dig>  an18g <dig> , repressed in hacaca- <dig> and putative elongation factors an11g <dig>  an14g <dig>  an16g <dig>  an16g <dig>  an01g <dig>  an06g <dig>  an02g <dig>  an02g <dig> and an04g <dig> repressed in the other time points .

new leads on the ress mechanism
the accumulation of misfolded protein in the er leads to a selective down-regulation of genes encoding secreted proteins in fungi and plants  <cit> . this phenomenon is termed repression under secretion stress . in these studies, associated with the upr activation by chemical induction is the down-regulation of transcription encoding extracellular enzymes that include cellulases and xylanases in t. reesei  <cit>  and glucoamylase in a. niger  <cit>  amongst other genes encoding secreted proteins  <cit> . the mechanism by which the down-regulation is mediated is unknown, but glaa promoter studies in a. niger  indicated that a promoter region between  <dig> and 2 kb upstream of translational start is important and a direct mediation of ress through the upr was questioned  <cit> . ress has been recognized as an effort from the cells to prevent the entry and overload of newly synthesized proteins into the already “full” er  <cit> . in our study, the activation the upr by introducing the constitutive active form of the haca transcription factor lead to the down-regulation not only of glucoamylase , but also other genes coding for starch-degrading enzymes that include acid α-amylase , α-glucosidases a and b  and α-amylase c , and additional sugar transporters . in addition, the expression of the transcriptional activator of starch degrading enzymes is down-regulated  in the hacaca strain. it has been shown previously that the amyr transcription factor is induced  upon the shift from xylose to maltose medium, suggesting that this down-regulation is biologically relevant. the down-regulation of the amyr regulon and sugar transporters  had a clear phenotypic effect resulting in the inability of the hacaca strain to grow on starch . growth assays on other polymeric substrates  suggested that the down-regulation might not to be specific for starch but is relevant to other sugar polymers including xylan . several scenarios can be envisioned by which the constitutive activation of haca could result in down-regulation of secreted enzymes. we speculate that haca activation leads to inactivation of the transcriptional factor such as amyr , and possibly xlnr . the inactivation results in down-regulation of the entire regulon of the transcription factor. however, a direct effect of haca-mediated effects on individual promoters cannot be excluded. it will be of interest for future studies to determine the molecular mechanism that results in the down-regulation of amyr and amyr target genes in response to haca activation.

relation between yeast, filamentous fungi and mammalian upr counterparts
the mammalian er contains three types of transmembrane proteins – ire1p, perk and atf <dig> – which sense the accumulation of unfolded proteins and are responsible to activate three different branches of the upr pathway . most of the players in the ire1p pathway are conserved in fungi  <cit>  in which, by activation of the transcription factor hac1p/haca, there is an induction of expression of upr target genes related to the folding machinery  <cit> , but proteins homologous to perk and atf <dig> seem to be absent from fungal systems.

to prevent the influx of proteins into the er in mammalian cells, a mechanism of translation attenuation is activated that is mediated by perk. this transcription factor mediates the phosphorylation of eif <dig>  which in turn leads to the arrest of protein translation. the eif <dig> is also required for the translation of selective mrnas such as the activating transcription factor- <dig>   <cit> . atf <dig> is involved in the regulation of upr genes involved in erad, metabolism and apoptosis  <cit> . gcn4p/cpca are the atf <dig> homologues of s. cerevisiae and filamentous fungi, respectively. both s. cerevisiae and a. niger  lack an obvious perk homologue. gcn2p phosphorylates eif <dig> leading to a global reduction on protein synthesis and stimulation of gcn <dig> translation, that has been shown to control amino acid biosynthesis  <cit> . although this resembles the perk function, gcn2p–eif <dig> phosphorylation is only attributed to amino acid starvation and not to er stress  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae, the involvement of gcn2p and gcn4p in the upr has been shown  <cit> . in our transcriptomic profiles, a gcn <dig> homologue  is not differentially expressed, whereas cpca  shows ≈  <dig> fold higher expression in comparison with the wild-type strain. according to our results the activation of cpca is likely to occur in a gcn2p-independent way and it is tempting to speculate that in filamentous fungi a similar perk-eif2-atf <dig> pathway may exist. atf <dig> is involved in glutathione biosynthesis  <cit>  and glutathione-s-transferases have been shown to be up-regulated under er stress conditions  <cit> . according to our data, the homologue to human glutathione-s-transferase  <dig>  is 2-fold induced in hacaca- <dig> and  <dig>  fold induced at the later time points. what we also observe is that as in the case of atf4-regulated genes, not all the genes involved in glutathione metabolism are affected under secretion stress situation  <cit> , as for example asparagine synthase  or glutathione reductase  that are not differentially expressed. similar results have been observed in t. reesei <cit> .

another interesting observation is the 4-fold induction of the human homologue rna-activated protein kinase inhibitor p <dig> . in mammals, p <dig> is induced via atf <dig>  a transcription factor also involved in the regulation of upr chaperones and apoptosis , and it is an important component on the regulation of perk-eif2-atf <dig> pathway, attenuating the upr  <cit> . the up-regulation of p <dig> has been shown in studies characterizing the upr under different conditions  <cit> ; however, the role and  involvement of a fungi p <dig> homologue in this pathway remains to be elucidated. atf <dig>  that induces xbp <dig> , also possesses the ability to enhance lipid biosynthesis and expansion of the er  <cit> . the identification of these potential regulatory genes involved in mediating the haca response in this study has given multiple new leads for further research to better understand the mechanism of how a. niger  reacts to secretion stress.

CONCLUSIONS
the combination of a genetic defined constitutively activated haca transcription factor mutant and controlled bioreactor cultivation conditions have provided a solid basis for a genome-wide expression analysis to study the response of a. niger  towards er stress. comparison of the transcriptome obtained form the constitutive haca mutant to previous studies in which er stress was induced by chemical treatments or the expression of a heterologous protein revealed a consistent up-regulation of genes associated with the secretory pathway. because of the highly defined conditions and reduced heterogeneity in our cultures, this study revealed new categories of differentially expressed genes as well as a larger number of genes related to individual categories. we also show that constitutively activation of the haca transcription factor has a negative effect on the expression and consequently the production of extracellular enzymes. we conclude that activation of haca induces a dual response to cope with er stress: increasing the folding capacity of the cell by the up-regulation of genes related to secretion processes in the er on the one hand and reducing the import of new proteins into the er by reducing the expression of genes encoding secreted proteins on the other hand.
