BACKGROUND
the molecular family of heat shock proteins  has been intensively studied in model organisms such as xenopus and drosophila submitted to stress in the laboratory  <cit>  and, consequently, the physiological role of these proteins is becoming well understood at molecular and cellular levels in these models. the hsps, in particular the  <dig> kda  family, are constitutively expressed in cells under normal  conditions and function as molecular chaperones, to keep other proteins from forming inappropriate aggregations. aside from this function, hsps are also implicated in the general protection of stressed cells and organisms  <cit> . many studies have reported that exposure of organisms to such diverse stressors as temperature extremes, pollutants, anoxia, parasitism, predation, or competition; all elicit reversible increases in hsp <dig> expression that serve to protect the organism against cellular damage  <cit> . the involvement of hsp <dig> in the acclimation of fish to salinity changes has also been well documented experimentally  <cit> . in the silver sea bream, sparus sarba  <cit> , branchial expression of hsp <dig> is increased in response to hypo- or hyper-osmotic shock.

it has been shown that increases in basal hsp <dig> levels in stressful environments can be associated with reduced individual fitness  <cit> . this association of hsp induction with fitness has been demonstrated for traits of development, growth and reproduction  <cit> . in drosophila melanogaster, heat shock stress results in developmental defects and increased copy numbers of the gene encoding hsp <dig>  <cit> . higher muscle hsp <dig> levels have been associated with lower growth rates in the indo-pacific sergean, abudefduf vaigiensis, adapted to 32°c by comparison to those living at 28°c  <cit> . in the silver sea bream, s. sarba, the activity and mrna levels of hsp <dig> are lower around isoosmotic salinities, where the best growth performance is observed  <cit> . the hsp <dig> may, therefore, provide a biomarker to identify stressful effects of environmental factors and to demonstrate a link between such factors and observed negative changes in life history traits of natural populations.

another indicator of osmoregulatory challenges in fish is the sodium-potassium atpase , a membrane protein which maintains ion gradients required for cell homeostasis and whose activity in the gills is related to either active ion secretion in hyper-osmotic conditions or active uptake in hypo-osmotic conditions  <cit> . several in vitro studies have shown substantial correlations between environmental salinity and expression and/or activity of na+, k+-atpase  in teleost fish  <cit> . in the tilapia oreochromis mossambicus, the activity of naka has been used as a biochemical indicator of osmoregulatory stress  <cit> . therefore, the induction of naka can be used to assess the osmoregulatory status of fish in natural environments where salinity is the predominant abiotic stressor.

the black-chinned tilapia s. melanotheron has populations in the saloum estuary in west africa which experience salinities that range from brackish water to extremely hypersaline water , and where salinity can show considerable variations between wet and dry seasons  <cit> . previous studies have shown that individuals inhabiting the highest salinities exhibit reduced growth rates  <cit>  and precocious reproduction  <cit> . although these phenotypic differences have been interpreted as indicative of hypersaline stress, this remains to be demonstrated.

in a previous study  <cit> , multiple copies  of a gene encoding hsp <dig>  and naka  were isolated in a hypersaline ssh library created from gills of s. melanotheron acclimatised either to hypersaline water or to freshwater. accordingly, tine et al.  <cit>  proposed that these genes must be indicators of the stressful effects of salinity on this species. the aim of this study was, therefore, to evaluate gill hsp <dig> induction as a biomarker of constitutive organismal stress in natural populations of s. melanotheron sampled from environments with salinities ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> psu. gill naka expression levels were measured in parallel, as an indicator of the osmoregulatory status of the populations. the same sampling sites have previously been studied for the effects of salinity on life history traits and induction of osmoregulatory genes  in s. melanotheron  <cit> . the relative expression of hsp <dig> and naka mrna was quantified by real time pcr. the condition factor of the fish was also measured, as a proxy of physiological status  <cit> .

RESULTS
branchial abundance of hsp <dig> and naka mrna
the rt-pcr analysis showed that the two primer pairs amplified a simple specific product with an efficiency of  <dig>  for hsp <dig>   <dig>  for naka and  <dig>  for β-actin. we therefore calculated relative abundance to correct for the differences in efficiency. a significant impact of salinity on hsp <dig> relative expression was observed within the saloum estuary, fish sampled at the upstream location with highest salinity  had higher hsp <dig> mrna levels than fish sampled in less saline stations  . the amounts of hsp <dig> mrna were not different between foundiougne and missirah. the naka mrna levels exhibited a pattern similar to hsp <dig> between locations, being highest at the most saline station, kaolack, but lowest at the least saline location of missirah . where the salinity was intermediate, at foundiougne, there were intermediate naka mrna levels.

condition factor
the average condition factor  varied significantly between sites and salinities . fish caught in kaolack, the most saline location, had the lowest condition, significantly lower than at missirah, the least saline location, where the best condition was recorded. salinity at foundiougne was intermediate, with no significant difference from the other two sites.

correlations between salinity, mrna levels and condition factor
the results show significant relationships between environmental salinity and the relative expression of hsp <dig> and naka or condition factor. there was a significant positive correlation between salinity and relative expression of hsp <dig>  or naka , and a negative correlation of condition factor to salinity . there was a significant positive correlation between hsp <dig> and naka relative expression  , and a negative relationship between condition factor and relative expression of hsp <dig>  or naka  .

discussion
the sahelian area of west african is characterized by an extended dry season from november to june, and a short dry season from july to october. in the senegalese saloum estuary, salinity levels change between these two seasons  <cit> . the salinity in the estuary decreases during the rainy season due to the input of freshwater by precipitation. in the dry season, however, the salinity increases because of intense evaporation  <cit> . the fish analysed in this study were collected at the end of the dry season  when the salinity in the estuary will have been stable for some months. furthermore, it has been demonstrated that populations of s. melanotheron do not undertake large scale movements in the estuaries  <cit> . therefore, it is reasonable to consider that fish were acclimatized to the prevailing salinity conditions at the time of collection.

it is, of course, not just salinity that can elicit the induction of stress proteins, but also thermal stressors, oxygen depletion and environmental contaminants  <cit> . previous studies conducted in the saloum estuary have shown that the water temperature varies only slightly between locations, and that dissolved oxygen is not a limiting factor for the black-chinned tilapia in these areas  <cit> . water turbidity cannot explain overexpression at the hypersaline kaolack location because it is much more turbid at the estuary mouth than in the upper part of the estuary during the dry season  <cit> . a heavily polluted location   <cit>  did not have higher hsp <dig> expression levels than at an unpolluted site with similar salinity  , indicating that differences in pollutant load did not contribute to differential expression. variations in salinity are therefore the most dominant environmental factor in the saloum estuary, and salinity is the predominant abiotic stressor.

the present study demonstrates significant correlations between hsp <dig> and naka expression, environmental salinity and condition factor in natural populations of s. melanotheron. the overexpression of hsp <dig> and naka of the fish living in hypersaline conditions correlates significantly with their lower condition factor.

osmoregulatory role of hsp70
if the mrna levels indicate differences in functionally active proteins, the correlation between hsp <dig> expression and salinity might reflect a direct role of the stress protein in salinity tolerance by black-chinned tilapia. this is in agreement with the correlations between salinity and the relative expression of hsp <dig> and naka, and with several in vitro studies, where increased nacl resulted in high hsp <dig> induction  <cit> . studies recently conducted in the silver sea bream, sparus sarba  <cit>  and the brown trout, salmo trutta  <cit>  have shown concomitant increases in hsp <dig> and naka mrna levels in response to hyperosmotic stress. the increase in hsp <dig> was attributed to a role of this protein in avoiding protein disruption and damage  <cit> . this function of hsp <dig> would explain its overexpression in fish living at the extremely hypersaline site . however, our results did not show a significant difference between the fish living in salinity approaching seawater  versus relatively hypersaline water , suggesting the existence of a threshold for salinity stress and therefore hsp <dig> overexpression. it has been shown in the black sea bream s. sarba that three genes of the hsp <dig> family  were up-regulated in the gills at a salinity of  <dig> psu, and exhibited an even higher expression in hypersaline water at  <dig> psu  <cit> . this was interpreted as a threshold for salt tolerance by the gill in this species which, once exceeded, caused an activation of stress proteins to prevent cell damage. in the black-chinned tilapia, the threshold of salinity tolerance for a significant activation of stress protein appears to be located beyond  <dig> psu.

ecological and evolutionary importance of hsp <dig> in s. melanotheron
studies in various model organisms have indicated reduced fitness in stressful conditions, which could be directly attributed to the metabolism of stress proteins themselves. that is, the expenditure of more energy on protection by stress protein synthesis would deviate energy from development, growth and reproduction  <cit> . consistent with this hypothesis, modified drosophila cells continuallyexpressing hsp <dig> have reduced growth compared to control cells, but subsequently resume normal growth if the hsp <dig> is isolated from the cytoplasm  <cit> . this may, at least in part, explain why the lowest condition factor occurred in the fish from the most saline location  where the expression levels of hsp <dig> were highest. previous studies have shown that the same species from the kaolack location of the saloum estuary had reduced growth, poor condition factors, precocious reproduction and lower fecundities compared with the less saline sampling locations  <cit> . the decline in these life history traits in this area could reflect a high energy requirement to meet the increased energetic demands for osmoregulation, in particular the increased expression and activity of ion pumps including the naka. although it is not simple to establish direct relationships between the hsp <dig> induction and the fish condition without performing common garden experiments, these impaired growth and poor condition factors could also reflect a high energy requirement for synthesis of proteins needed for the survival at higher salinities  <cit> . it has also been suggested that, at high concentrations, stress proteins could be toxic and therefore alter or interfere with the normal cellular functions, notably cell growth and development  <cit> . therefore, in addition to the energy costs of hsp synthesis, toxic effects of high hsp concentrations could also contribute to differences in growth and condition factors observed between populations of s. melanotheron inhabiting the saloum estuary.

there is, of course, the possibility that differences in growth among populations reflect differences in resources at the sites. in others words, food resources could be more abundant in the environments with lowest salinities. it is also possible that individuals are more effective at foraging when they are not stressed by salinity, and/or that they are more efficient at assimilating nutrients from their prey. these individuals may be able to invest more in growth and reproduction than their counterparts living in hypersaline zones with less energy available for normal biological functions. in this study we do not have measures of food availability, but the opportunistic nature of this species, an omnivore that can exploit many food sources, may indicate that food is not limiting in hypersaline zones of the saloum estuary.

if the variation of a trait has a genetic basis and affects the fitness of individuals, the variation among populations in hsp <dig> expression in this study may reflect an action of natural selection. the large spatial and temporal differences of salinity in the environments inhabited by s. melanotheron, associated with the central role hsp <dig> may play in salinity tolerance, makes this gene a potential target for the local selection in this species. the salinity in the saloum estuary is not only significantly higher at kaolack location, but the seasonal variations are also larger, with amplitudes that can exceed  <dig> psu  <cit> . interestingly, another member of hsps family, the hsc <dig> locus has recently been demonstrated to be polymorphic in natural populations of the european flounder, platichthys flesus, inhabiting environments with different salinities  <cit> . although this polymorphism has been suggested to arise from the action of natural selection at this locus, the authors were unable to say which of three environmental factors  might be responsible and whether the polymorphism was associated with variation in hsc <dig> expression and/or activity. in our study, salinity is clearly a potential selective agent which could be responsible for differences in hsp <dig> expression in s. melanotheron, but further analyses of polymorphism in the regulatory regions are required to establish whether there are adaptive polymorphisms at this locus.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides the first demonstration, in wild fish populations, that hsp <dig> is involved in long-term acclimatisation to a salinity range between  <dig> and  <dig> psu. the data demonstrate that the most hypersaline conditions were stressful for s. melanotheron. this chronic stress may be responsible for the impaired growth, precocious reproduction and low fecundity observed at these sites  <cit> . these negative impacts on life history traits may reflect a high energy requirement for osmoregulation and synthesis of proteins needed for the survival at high salinities rather than limited food resources or lower feeding efficiency. the significant correlation of hsp <dig> mrna levels with fish condition suggests that this gene may be a potential biomarker of fish health in estuarine environments. investigating the activity of hsp <dig> and the mechanisms which regulate its expression in wild population of s. melanotheron are interesting topics for future research.
