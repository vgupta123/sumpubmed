BACKGROUND
eusocial insects, and ants in particular, are becoming increasingly popular models for the genetics and neurobiology of social behavior  <cit> . chemical communication is the predominant mode of coordination in insect societies and as such is essential for insect eusociality  <cit> . understanding the molecular and neural underpinnings of social insect chemosensation may therefore provide broad insight into social evolution and behavior  <cit> . in insects, odorants are detected by receptor proteins embedded in olfactory and gustatory receptor neurons, which are located in porous sensilla and surrounded by sensillar lymph. odorants enter the sensilla through the pores and diffuse through the sensillar lymph to the receptor proteins, binding and activating these proteins to produce action potentials in the receptor neurons. a variety of accessory proteins in the receptor lymph are also involved in this process, including two families of olfaction-related small soluble proteins  – the odorant binding proteins  and the chemosensory proteins . these proteins help solubilize hydrophobic chemicals and may aid in odor detection, discrimination and coding  <cit> .

although several studies have demonstrated the importance of orssps in insect chemosensation , their exact function has been hard to pinpoint. additionally, many proteins in both families are expressed in non-olfactory tissues and have been linked to such diverse functions as developmental patterning, internal pheromone transport and release, and leg regeneration . both obps and csps have evolved dynamically between insect orders, with high gene birth and death rates and highly variable copy numbers in different genomes  <cit> . on the other hand, genes in both protein families appear to be more conserved at lower taxonomic levels, with mostly single-copy orthology in the genus drosophila and family aphidae, and a mix of single-copy orthology and dynamic evolution in the family culicidae and in the wasp infraorder aculeata  . no study has yet examined the links between evolutionary history and tissue localization, nor systematically examined orssp expression patterns in a broadly comparative context.

we therefore decided to investigate the evolution of orssp expression patterns in ants using genomics, phylogenetics, and transcriptomics. methods include manual re-annotation of ant obp and csp gene families, manual annotation of obp and csp genes in the transcriptome of the paper wasp polistes canadensis, extensive phylogenetic analyses, and a 14-library tissue-specific rna-seq data set from the clonal raider ant cerapachys biroi, supplemented by a re-analysis of four libraries of previously published rna-seq data from the ants harpegnathos saltator and camponotus floridanus  <cit> . we find that a stable set of eight conserved genes  present in single copy orthology across aculeata are moderately to highly expressed in the antennae of the three divergent ant species, along with four to five genes from more dynamically evolving lineages previously hypothesized to act in chemical communication. interestingly, seven of the conserved genes are expressed specifically in the antennae of cerapachys biroi, while four of five dynamically evolving genes are more broadly expressed. these results indicate that antennal orssps fulfill important and conserved roles in olfaction, rather than evolving rapidly to recognize specific ligands.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis
within the odorant binding and chemosensory protein families, sequence divergence is high, with average amino acid identities of only 17% for insect obps and 34% for arthropod csps  <cit> . because of the analytical challenges associated with highly divergent sequences, we inferred phylogenies for obps and csps within the eusocial hymenoptera using bayesian co-estimation of sequence alignment and phylogeny, as well as traditional multiple sequence alignment with maximum likelihood tree inference. table  <dig> lists all eusocial hymenopteran species examined and the number of obp and csp gene models in each species. additionally, we constructed maximum likelihood phylogenies for obps and csps across arthropoda.table  <dig>

topologies were largely congruent across our analyses, although support values for individual nodes varied considerably and were generally low. our analyses of eusocial hymenopteran obps consistently recovered four major groups: one containing well-supported clades of strict single-copy orthologs  , one containing the apis mellifera ‘c-minus’ expansion with a few ant paralogs , one containing mostly ant species-specific expansions with a few a. mellifera and p. canadensis paralogs , and one containing a single clade of highly conserved obps, highly divergent from other obps and present in single-copy orthology in all species except a. mellifera  . the obp59a group is so divergent from other aculeate obps that it had been missed entirely in all previous ant obp annotations. the group is orthologous to drosophila melanogaster obp59a, and we therefore decided to name it accordingly. two p. canadensis obps  did not fit into any of these groups and likely represent ancestral groups lost in the ants and the honey bee.figure  <dig>

combined analysis of our eusocial hymenopteran dataset and other insect species revealed that the paralog groups are young, aculeata-specific expansions. on the other hand, all ortholog clades within the ortholog group and the obp59a group have nasonia orthologs, and many also have non-hymenoptera orthologs . this indicates that the single-copy ortholog groups date back at least as far as the split between hymenoptera and the rest of endopterygota, ca.  <dig> mya  <cit> , while the other two groups are most likely younger than the most recent common ancestor of nasonia and aculeata, ca.  <dig> mya  <cit> .

analyses of eusocial hymenopteran csps showed evolutionary patterns consistent with kulmuni et al.  <cit>  and similar to obps. two well-supported groups were recovered, one containing exclusively well-supported clades of single-copy orthologs with a. mellifera and/or p. canadensis orthologs, and one containing mostly ant species-specific expansions, but encompassing a single clade of single-copy orthologs including an a. mellifera ortholog . among the single-copy orthologs was a novel clade missed in previous ant csp annotations, possibly orthologous to amelcsp <dig>  a full-length potential ortholog of csp <dig> was present in the ants harpegnathos saltator, cerapachys biroi, and camponotus floridanus, but present only as a highly pseudogenized fragment in linepithema humile and missing in all myrmicine ants. comparison with other arthropod csps showed that the paralogous ant-specific expansions group is a hymenoptera-specific radiation, while the single-copy ortholog clades are much older and diverged before hexapods split from the rest of pancrustacea, ca.  <dig> mya  <cit>  .figure  <dig>

evolutionary dynamics
to quantify the dynamism of the ant expansion and paralog groups compared to the single-copy orthology and obp59a groups, we conducted statistical gene birth and death analyses for all four obp groups  and both csp groups  using the cafe and jprime-dlrs analyses  <cit> . cafe uses maximum likelihood modeling and ancestral state reconstruction of gene copy numbers and is thus likely conservative as it doesn’t take the gene tree  into account. jprime-dlrs estimates birth and death rates jointly with a gene tree given a species tree, using the dlrs  model within a bayesian mcmc framework.

as expected, cafe estimated lower birth and death rates than jprime-dlrs . both methods showed dynamic evolution in the paralog and ant expansion groups, with birth and death rates ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  as estimated by cafe and  <dig>  to  <dig>  as estimated by jprime-dlrs. estimates of birth and death rates were often more than an order of magnitude lower for the single-copy orthology and obp59a groups, with estimates of  <dig> x10-11- <dig>  and  <dig> - <dig>  for cafe and jprime-dlrs, respectively.table  <dig>

although several studies have examined selective pressures in both obps and csps  <cit> , these studies have used different methods and different taxonomic sampling, making direct comparisons impossible. we thus conducted a suite of selection tests on both our obp and csp datasets using the codeml software in the paml package  <cit>  . site models of positive selection showed no significant positive selection family-wide for either csps or obps  and m7-m <dig> lrt, p >  <dig>  for both tests). clade tests for divergent selection showed that there was significant variance in selective pressures between the groups . clade model c showed 79% and 62% of sites are under divergent selection in obps and csps, respectively. obp paralog groups  <dig> and  <dig> and the csp ant expansion group showed much higher dn/ds in the divergently selected site class than the obp single-copy orthology, obp59a, and csp single-copy orthology groups . no group showed positive selection  in the divergently selected site class, indicating that relaxed selection was the predominant selective force in all groups.table  <dig>

we used branch-site tests of positive selection as described by zhang et al.  <cit>  to test for positive selection affecting each group. zhang et al.’s branch-site test  <dig>  can be positive when positive selection or relaxed selection is occurring along specified branches, while branch-site test  <dig>  tests specifically for positive selection along specified branches. we ran branch-site tests for each group by setting all branches within each group in turn as foreground branches. consistent with our clade model results, branch-site test  <dig> was significant for all groups except obp59a , but all groups were non-significant for test  <dig>  indicating relaxed selection operating on all groups but the obp59a group. we also split our data and ran site tests for positive selection for each group analyzed separately. interestingly, although branch-site tests for positive selection  were negative for all groups, site tests for positive selection for each group analyzed separately were significant for the ant expansion csp group and obp paralog group  <dig> . this could indicate that divergent relaxed selection is swamping the signal of divergent positive selection in the branch-site tests for these two groups. bayes empirical bayes  analysis identified two sites with dn/ds significantly greater than one in the ant expansion csp group for the m <dig> model, one of which was also significant in the m2a model. no obp paralog group  <dig> sites had dn/ds significantly greater than one in either m <dig> or m2a models according to the beb analysis.

sex-specific antennal expression
initially, we sequenced one cdna library each for cerapachys biroi male and female antennae to generate  <dig> million and  <dig> million 100 bp paired-end reads, respectively. alignment and quantification of reads revealed high levels of transcription for subsets of both obps and csps . among the genes in the paralog clades, cbircsp <dig> was the only one expressed at high levels in antennae. conversely, many genes in the ortholog clades were expressed at high levels in antennae; cbircsp <dig> and cbirobp <dig> were non-significantly enriched in male vs. female antennae, while cbircsp <dig>  cbirobp <dig>  cbirobp <dig>  and cbirobp <dig> were expressed at higher levels in the female antennae, and this was significant for cbirobp <dig> . cbircsp <dig>  cbircsp <dig>  cbirobp <dig>  cbirobp <dig>  and cbirobp <dig> were found at moderate to low levels in both male and female antennae .figure  <dig>

a reanalysis of previously published sex-specific antennal rna-seq data from the ants harpegnathos saltator and camponotus floridanus
 <cit>  revealed expression profiles highly similar to those of c. biroi . this was especially true for h. saltator, which showed nearly identical expression patterns for single-copy orthologs, except for a reversal in sex-specific enrichment for obp <dig> and very low expression of csp <dig>  two members of single-copy orthology clades, obp <dig> and obp <dig>  are not annotated in the c. floridanus official gene set, as the assembly of the respective genomic regions is fragmentary. thus, their expression levels were not included in the dataset. however, all other orthologs of proteins expressed in c. biroi antennae are likewise expressed in c. floridanus antennae. several other genes are expressed at high levels in c. floridanus antennae, notably cflocsp <dig>  cfloobp <dig>  and several csps in the paralog clade. intriguingly, no annotated obp or csp was noticeably male-enriched in c. floridanus antennae in our analysis.

female tissue-specific expression
in order to test which c. biroi obps and csps are specifically expressed in antennae, we sequenced three biological replicates of cdna libraries from female antennae, heads , legs, and bodies . we obtained an average of  <dig> million 100 bp single-end reads per library. additional sequencing of male samples was not possible, because males are produced exceedingly rarely in c. biroi
 <cit> . cbirobp <dig>  cbirobp <dig>  cbirobp <dig> and cbirobp59a, as well as cbircsp <dig>  cbircsp <dig>  and cbircsp <dig> were significantly enriched in the antennae compared with other tissues . all female antenna-specific genes except cbircsp <dig> and cbirobp59a belong to conserved single-copy ortholog clades with a. mellifera and p. canadensis orthologs  and with moderate to high expression in h. saltator and/or c. floridanus antennae . cbirobp59a does belong to a conserved single-copy ortholog clade but has no a. mellifera ortholog  and is expressed only at low levels in the antennae of all three ant species . expression of cbircsp <dig>  also a single-copy ortholog, was not enriched in worker antennae , but given its male-biased expression  it might be antenna-enriched in males. cbirobp <dig>  cbirobp <dig>  cbirobp <dig>  cbircsp <dig>  and cbircsp <dig> were most significantly enriched in antennae and legs vs. heads and bodies . cbircsp <dig>  cbircsp <dig>  and cbirobp <dig> were most highly expressed in bodies . cbirobp <dig> was expressed nearly exclusively in heads . cbirobp <dig> was expressed at low levels in heads, bodies and legs, but expression was only significantly different between bodies and antennae . the rest of the genes had only a few reads that mapped to them , indicating that these genes are either expressed only at low levels, or show high levels of expression only in other developmental stages or non-antennal tissues in males. table  <dig> shows how many obps and csps are expressed at greater than  <dig> fpkm in each tissue.figure  <dig>

discussion
aculeate odorant binding and chemosensory proteins display similar phylogenetic patterns, with several highly conserved clades with single-copy orthologs in all or most species and one  and two  dynamically evolving clades with many species-specific expansions. in contrast to previous hypotheses  <cit> , it is primarily a conserved subset of single-copy orthologs which are expressed in ant antennae. in cerapachys biroi, only one dynamically evolving csp is expressed specifically in antennae, in contrast to five conserved obps and two conserved csps showing antenna-specific expression. this is also the first study to demonstrate antenna-specific expression of obps in ants, contradicting the hypothesis that csps alone are expressed antenna-specifically in ants  <cit> . our results suggest that obps and csps primarily fulfill important conserved roles in ant olfaction rather than dynamically evolving to recognize species-specific odorants.

ants use both obps and csps for olfaction
krieger and ross  <cit>  identified the first ant odorant binding protein in the fire ant solenopsis invicta, gp-9/sinvobp <dig>  however, this protein is not antenna specific, but rather broadly expressed in the hemolymph  <cit> . ishida et al.  <cit>  identified a single antenna-specific csp in the argentine ant linepithema humile, and later leal and ishida  <cit>  identified an antenna-specific csp in s. invicta. ozaki et al.  <cit>  found a csp in the antennae of camponotus japonicus, which was shown to function in chemical nestmate recognition. all of these studies were limited to identifying a single major antennal protein, although studies in other organisms indicate that many binding proteins likely contribute to olfaction  <cit> . despite the scant evidence, calvello et al.  <cit>  proposed that ants may preferentially use csps rather than obps for olfaction. more recently, gonzalez et al.  <cit>  found an additional obp  in s. invicta antennae using shotgun proteomics. however, it was not tested whether this protein was antenna specific or expressed throughout the body, as is the case for sinvobp <dig> 

our systematic investigation of orssp expression revealed that obps as well as csps can be specifically expressed in the antennae of ants. only a small subset of each protein family is antenna specific in workers, however, with only eight antenna-specific small soluble proteins in c. biroi. five additional proteins expressed in c. biroi antennae and legs may be involved in gustatory chemosensation . in contrast, there are between nine and sixteen obps, and between one and three csps thought to be involved in olfaction in the honey bee apis mellifera
 <cit> , and this has been considered a remarkably low number relative to dipterans, which possess  <dig> to  <dig> obps alone, most of which are expressed specifically in chemosensory organs  <cit> . the low number of antenna-specific obps and csps in ants is an enigma, as ants show remarkable olfactory abilities and advanced chemical communication. as has been proposed for a. mellifera, ants may compensate for a lack of olfactory small soluble proteins by the expansion of chemosensory receptor genes. indeed, ants possess more than twice as many odorant receptors  as a. mellifera, and well over four times as many as d. melanogaster . however, or and orssp repertoires are not necessarily inversely correlated. for example, the red flour beetle  has more ors than a. mellifera, and nearly three times the combined number of obps and csps  <cit> .

three obps and two csps are expressed at moderate to high levels in both antennae and legs of c. biroi and may also be involved in gustatory chemosensation, especially as legs are known to be involved in taste in other species including the honey bee . alternatively, these genes may be generally associated with the cuticle but not serve chemosensory functions. for example, several d. melanogaster obps are highly expressed in the cuticle, but not specifically in the chemosensory hairs  <cit> . forêt et al.  <cit>  hypothesized that some csps may function in cuticle synthesis. antennae and legs are the most cuticle-rich tissues sequenced in our study, thus expression of these genes is directly correlated with relative cuticle abundance.

conservation of antennal expression in obps and csps
both gotzek et al.  <cit>  and kulmuni et al.  <cit>  speculated that the more dynamically evolving obps and csps were more likely to be expressed in the antennae and involved in olfactory processes, especially pheromone perception. this is because pheromones themselves evolve rapidly and dynamically  <cit> , and if any orssps specifically recognized pheromones they should co-evolve with the respective pheromones. our results contradict this hypothesis, showing that primarily a stable set of conserved obps and csps are expressed specifically in the antennae of ants. this is corroborated by the fact that two of three previously identified antennal-specific orssps  are in single-copy ortholog clades with the antenna-specific cbircsp <dig>  although most relationships between obp single-copy ortholog clades are poorly supported, the antennally expressed obps obp <dig> and obp <dig> form a well-supported clade in all analyses. phylogenetic and expression data are thus consistent with transitions between antennal and non-antennal expression of obps occurring four times prior to the evolution of ants, with subsequent complete conservation of antennal expression among ants. csps csp <dig> and csp <dig> are not particularly closely related and likely represent independent transitions between antennal and non-antennal expression, and one to a few additional proteins in the rapidly evolving ant expansions csp clade appear to be recruited to antennal expression.

the conservation of expression may extend even further than ants. one antenna-specific c. biroi csp  and all but one antenna-specific c. biroi obp  have antenna-specific orthologs in a. mellifera  <cit> . cbircsp <dig> also has antenna-specific orthologs in polistes dominula and vespa crabro  <cit> . an interesting case is obp59a, which is present in all ants and is antenna specific in c. biroi, but missing in a. mellifera and thus previously missed in the ant obp annotations. this protein is exceptional in two ways: it is the lowest expressed antenna-specific protein in c. biroi, and it is present in single-copy orthology in every single insect species examined by us and vieira and rozas  <cit>  except a. mellifera. in d. melanogaster, obp59a is highly enriched in heads  compared to all other tissues, and the respective protein has been detected in the antennae by proteomic studies  <cit> . this protein may thus represent an extreme example of olfactory function conservation. although vieira and rozas  <cit>  highlight the parallels of this gene with orco, a universally conserved and highly expressed odorant co-receptor necessary for the function of all ors, the lack of obp59a in a. mellifera, combined with its low expression level in c. biroi antennae, does not support such a critical role.

it should also be noted that the ant orthologs of the a. mellifera c-minus clade , which are moderately expressed in the antennae of h. saltator and c. floridanus, may also be specifically expressed in the antennae of ant species with functional copies of these genes. only a small pseudogene fragment of the c. biroi ortholog remains , and, due to the lack of functional members of this clade in c. biroi, we could not determine antenna specificity.

functional implications
there is growing debate over whether obps and csps directly recognize odorants and contribute to odor coding or act as more or less specific odorant solubilizing agents  <cit> . selective binding of odorants by certain obps and csps initially indicated that they may indeed be essential for odorant recognition  <cit> . structural studies showing large conformational shifts upon odorant binding suggested a model wherein binding proteins specifically recognize odorants, alter conformation upon binding, and then directly activate ors  <cit> . this was seemingly confirmed by a study of the d. melanogaster obp lush, which showed that a recombinant lush protein stuck in bound conformation could directly activate a pheromone-sensitive odorant receptor  <cit> . however, other studies have called into question the proposed selectivity of obp and csp binding, as well as the implications of binding affinities for in vivo function  <cit> . additionally, a recent study has demonstrated that conformationally activated lush is not an in vivo ligand for pheromone-sensitive ors, and suggested a broader role for lush in solubilizing multiple fly pheromones  <cit> .

given the startling array of chemicals different ant species use for communication  <cit> , it seems unlikely that the few obps and csps expressed in chemosensory organs could selectively recognize a large proportion of pheromone components. furthermore, pheromones are known to evolve rapidly and dynamically  <cit> , and receptor proteins known to specifically recognize odorants also evolve rapidly and dynamically, with many gene births and deaths even within families and genera  <cit> . the highly conserved nature of most antenna-specific obps and csps indicates that they are not evolving to specifically recognize new pheromones and likely do not specifically recognize other odorants. although one to three dynamically evolving csps may be recruited for chemosensation in a given ant species, this number is clearly not sufficient to recognize all of the species-specific chemical signals. our data suggest that, rather than specifically recognizing pheromones, most ant orssps fulfill important, highly conserved, and more general roles in olfaction.  <cit> 

CONCLUSIONS
contrary to previous expectations, both odorant binding proteins and chemosensory proteins are expressed specifically in antennae of the clonal raider ant cerapachys biroi and therefore likely serve olfactory functions. our findings show that an evolutionarily stable core group of highly conserved small soluble proteins are antennally expressed in ants. additionally, we propose that a few proteins are also recruited from more dynamically evolving lineage-specific expansions, preferentially from the ant expansion csp group. in total, between eight and fourteen obps and csps are potentially involved in chemosensation in the species we examined. given the startlingly large array of pheromones used in ants, we suggest that there are too few small soluble proteins to specifically recognize individual pheromones. the striking evolutionary stability of antennal expression rather indicates that chemosensory orssps participate in important and highly conserved processes. future functional studies should address questions such as whether ligand binding and solubilization properties are conserved in the conserved antenna-specific small soluble proteins, and whether the few csps recruited from the more dynamically evolving ant expansion clade are involved in more dynamically evolving processes such as chemical communication.
