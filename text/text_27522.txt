BACKGROUND
the pituitary is well known as one of the most important glands in the endocrine system, and secretes hormones that orchestrate many physiological processes such as growth, sexual development, metabolism and the stress response. it contains three lobes and is of dual embryonic origin  <cit> . the posterior lobe is of neuroectodermal origin while the anterior and intermediate lobes are of ectodermal origin. the anterior pituitary gland consists of five cell types: somatotrophs , lactotrophs , gonadotrophs , thyrotrophs , and corticotrophs . melanotrophs , proteolytically cleaved from pomc are the sixth hormone-producing cell type, but these are situated within the intermediate lobe. during embryonic development, the six specific cell types arise from rathke's pouch , and form the anterior and intermediate lobes under the control of various mechanisms  <cit> .

in the past several years, most aspects of pituitary development have been extensively explored, because of the relatively simple structure of the gland and its critical role in the neuroendocrine system  <cit> . according to the structural changes and cell-type-specific occurrence, development and differentiation of the pituitary can be divided into three major stages  <cit> . the onset of pituitary organogenesis is marked by a striking restriction of shh, bmp <dig>  fgf <dig> and wnt5a, which are uniformly expressed in the oral ectoderm from the invaginating rp. in murine embryos, this is formed around e <dig> , which results in a molecular boundary in the oral ectoderm  <cit> . the second phase of pituitary development appears to involve bmp <dig>  wnt <dig>  and prop <dig> expression, which participate in the progression from organ commitment to cell-type determination that occurs between e <dig> and e <dig>  at this time, the rp extends dorsally and expands to form a flattened epithelium close to the infundibular recess of the diencephalon. hes <dig> and hes <dig> have been identified to play a role in controlling the progenitor pool, intermediate lobe specification, and posterior lobe formation during pituitary development  <cit> . terminal differentiation of the hormone-secreting cells occurs after e <dig> and is marked by the expression of lh and fsh in gonadotrophs, gh in somatotrophs, and prl in lactotrophs. transcription factors like prop <dig>  tbx <dig>  gata <dig> and pou1f <dig> are necessary for the terminal differentiation events and cell-type-specific gene expression  <cit> .

three recent studies using cdna microarray have been carried out to profile gene expression pattern during pituitary development  <cit> . many genes, such as carboxypeptidase e , stathmin , endothelin type a receptor , dual-specificity phosphatase  <dig> , fgf <dig>  fgf <dig>  zhx1b, dusp <dig> and sox <dig>  were newly identified as being involved in the determination and cell-type-specific gene expression of the six mature endocrine cell types. it has been suggested that a large number of signaling molecules and transcription factors essential for pituitary development remain unclear, especially at the end of differentiation. all these large-scale studies were carried out based on neuroendocrine-system-specific cdna microarrays. in addition, it is necessary to point out that the understanding of pituitary development and the regulatory programs that control hormone expression have been mostly derived from animal experiments, in particular mice and chickens. accumulating evidence has implied that there are vital differences in gene expression profiles between development in mice and humans  <cit> . until now, there has been a lack of information from expressed sequence tag  libraries of human fetal pituitary.

for a comprehensive insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in human pituitary development, we used a relatively large number of ests to investigate the differentially expressed genes/ests in fetal and adult pituitaries. in addition to data from microarrays, the est data reported herein will lead to an additional understanding of human pituitary development and hormone expression.

RESULTS
general characteristics of ests derived from human pituitaries
to profile the gene expression of fetal pituitary,  <dig>  clones from the cdna library were randomly selected and sequenced from the 5' end. after removing rrna, as well as repetitive, mitochondrial and ambiguous sequences,  <dig>   high-quality ests were obtained and further analyzed. assembling of all available ests generated  <dig> cluster sets including  <dig> singleton  and  <dig> non-singleton clusters. they were deposited genbank in ncbi with accession numbers: cd236662–cd <dig>  the average cluster contained  <dig>  sequences. of which,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were matched known genes and ests, respectively. the remaining  <dig>  were considered as novel ests, because they did not match with any known genes or ests . the previous  <dig>  ests that we generated from adult pituitary glands  <cit>  were analyzed again and grouped into  <dig>  clusters. of which,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were respectively identified as known genes, known ests and unique ests found only in the pituitary cdna libraries . although a total of  <dig>  est clusters were derived from human pituitaries, only  <dig>  genes or ests were shared in both cdna resources, which suggested that there might have been a significant switch of pituitary functions during development because of the differential gene expression profiles between fetal and adult pituitaries .

screening of developmentally relevant genes
using the data from est sequencing, we could distinguish the potential development-associated genes from the gene expression profiles, particularly, genes that were expressed highly in the human fetus. in the first  <dig> genes expressed highly in both fetal and adult pituitaries , tissue-specific functional markers, such as gh, prl, and glycoprotein hormones alpha , were frequently encountered in both tissues, which reflected the basic pituitary functions.

except for pou1f <dig>  the pituitary-specific transcription factor, some development-associated genes, such as sox <dig>  suppression of tumorigenicity  <dig>  and fucosyltransferase  <dig>  were highly expressed in fetal pituitary, which implies that these genes are involved in pituitary development. by comparing both cdna resources, a total of  <dig>  clusters were significantly differently expressed in fetal and adult pituitaries  , including olfactory receptor  <dig>  hsp70-interacting protein, rab <dig>  heparin binding growth factor  <dig>  ednra and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase x, which were highly expressed in the fetus. also, ga-bingding protein transcription factor , hypoxia-inducible factor  <dig> , and transcription factor dp <dig>  were presented in the fetal pituitary est library.

expression pattern of sox4
there were eight  transcripts for sox <dig> in the fetal pituitary ests, but none was found in the adult pituitary cdna library. the expression pattern of sox <dig> during pituitary development was confirmed by semi-quantitative rt-pcr of human samples. the transcript level of sox <dig> was much higher in fetal pituitary but was reduced to a very low level in adult pituitary . at the same time, the transcription levels of gh, prl, pomc, tsh, fsh, lh, cga and cart  were increased in adult samples. to further address the issue, we examined expression of sox <dig> in e <dig> , e <dig>  and e <dig>  mouse embryos and in adult pituitary using in situ hybridization. on e <dig> , sox <dig> was expressed in the pituitary at modest levels in the infundibulum and rp . by e <dig> , sox <dig> expression was most abundant in the undifferentiated cells of the anterior, intermediate and posterior lobes , but significantly decreased at e <dig>  . in adults, the pituitary is fully differentiated and contains all of the hormone-secreting cell lineages. at this time-point, sox <dig> was not detected in either the anterior, intermediate or posterior lobes . the expression pattern was similar to that of the gene in pancreas  <cit>  and tibia  <cit>  development, which indicates that the activity of this gene is restricted to the cell specification and terminal differentiation phase of pituitary development.

tissue expression patterns of novel ests
the present study generated  <dig> novel ests. they did not show homologous with any known genes/ests or proteins of any species but human genomic dna by searching against nucleotide collection  database on ncbi. also they are all presented as singleton clusters. to establish potential functions, the tissue expression patterns of  <dig> selected novel ests were evaluated by semi-quantitative rt-pcr . most of these ests were expressed in a limited manner in certain tissues, and not ubiquitously in all  <dig> tissues examined. interestingly, some transcripts, such as cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig>  were highly expressed in pituitary glands and testes. meanwhile, some ests, such as cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> were specifically expressed in the brain, in addition to the pituitary. the expression of cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> was further confirmed by in situ hybridization with human fetal pituitary tissues . there were positive signals  in all the sections hybridized with anti-sense probes.

discussion
previous studies on the pituitary have focused on individual genes and signaling pathways involved in its development  <cit> , as well as expression and release of pituitary hormones, such as prl, lh and fsh  <cit> . with the advance of the human genome project, a large amount of genomic information is now available for surveying the physiological and pathological processes of humans at a global level. hormonal genomics has been proposed to develop postgenomic approaches substituting gene-by-gene ones to reveal the subfamilies and pathways for genes involved in the hormones signaling  <cit> . the functional subgenomes of secreted extracellular signaling molecules, transmembrane receptors, intracellular signaling molecules, and transcriptional factors can now be analyzed in an integrated manner. of which, est sequencing, series analysis of gene expression  and cdna microarray or gene chip analysis are the most efficient strategies for profiling gene expression at the transcriptome level  <cit> .

in this study, a total of  <dig>  est clusters were derived from  <dig>  ests generated from cdna libraries of human fetal and adult pituitaries. it was not as high as expected because of the limited number of human samples. we did confirm the information by semi-quantitative rt-pcr, in situ hybridization or reviewing previous studies. aside from semi-quantitative rt-pcr in this study, microarray analysis and quantitative rt-pcr carried out in our previous study also showed that the expression level of hormones, such as tshβ, pomc and gh in fetus, were relative lower than that in adult  <cit> . on the other hand, some genes such as ednra, were highly expressed in fetal pituitary, also in agreement with previous study performed by dr. ellestad using microarray  <cit> . although these studies were all to highlight the gene expression profile of pituitary, there is only few genes overlapped between these screens. most of the variations could be caused by methods different.

the partial transcription maps derived from these ests indicated that hormones and hormone-associated genes were predominant in adult pituitary, while development-associated genes were predominant in fetal pituitary, including sox <dig> and st <dig>  sox <dig> has been shown to be functionally involved in development of a wide range of tissues and cells, such as heart, b cells, reproductive system and central nervous system  <cit> . st <dig> may facilitate the chaperone function of hsc/hsp <dig> in protein folding and repair, and in controlling the activity of regulatory proteins such as steroid receptors and regulators of proliferation or apoptosis  <cit> . pou1f <dig>  necessary for cell lineage of thyrotrophs, somatotrophs and lactotrophs, was hit once in the cdna library of fetal pituitary. no significant different of its expression level could be detected between fetal and adult pituitary. it is in agreement with that pou1f <dig> is necessary but not sufficient for hormones gene activation  <cit> .

it was revealed for the first time that sox <dig>  a member of the sry-like high-mobility group  box gene family, was one of the most abundant mrnas in the fetal pituitary. the hmg box defines a superfamily of eukaryotic dna-binding proteins of central importance in mammalian gene regulation  <cit> , and sry defines the mammalian testis-determining factor encoded by the y chromosome  <cit> . sox protein is a specific hmg-box factor that is similar to sry. it is ubiquitous in the animal kingdom and is involved in diverse developmental processes, including germ layer formation, cell type specification, and organogenesis  <cit> . sox <dig> null mice die during embryogenesis because of failure of endocardial ridge development, and blocking of b-cell lineage progression at the stage of pro-b-lymphocyte expansion  <cit> .

explanted fetal thymic organ cultures  of sox-4-deficient thymus yielded 10–50-fold fewer cd4/cd <dig> double-positive and single-positive cells than ftocs of littermates  <cit> . lioubinski et al have reported that sox <dig> is expressed in insulin-producing pancreas islets, and co-expressed with glucagon during tissue development  <cit> . also, it has been reported that sox <dig> is expressed in the mouse uterus under ovarian hormone control. this suggests a developmental role for this gene in the female reproductive system, because its expression always appears to be related to the maturational stage of the cell population  <cit> . furthermore, cheung et al  <cit>  showed that sox <dig> might indeed had another functional role in brain development. it has been demonstrated that sox <dig> expression counteracts differentiation of radial glia and has to be down-regulated before full maturation can occur in the brain  <cit> . radial glia with prolonged expression of sox <dig> fail to migrate to the position normally assumed by bergmann glia, and do not extend radial fibers toward the pial surface  <cit> . the expression pattern of sox <dig> in pituitary development suggests that it is involved in pituitary cell differentiation; similar to its role in facilitating thymocyte differentiation, but it normally prevents premature differentiation of human pituitary.

in addition, we investigated the expression of  <dig> members of the sox gene family in the fetal human pituitary using rt-pcr. eleven of these members  were detected . it has recently been reported that sox <dig> had a critical role in the development of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis  <cit> , and deletion of sox <dig> can lead to abnormal development of rp and defects in pituitary function  <cit> . sox <dig> might be necessary for gonadotropin-releasing hormone cell differentiation  <cit> . obviously, members of the sox gene family might have a predominant role in the regulation of hypothalamus-pituitary axis formation.

except for the genes known to be associated with pituitary development, our data suggest that some other genes are involved in the differentiation and maturation of human pituitary. they contained genes for cytokines and their receptors, transcription factors, and those involved in the cell cycle, dna replication and signal transduction. of which, ga-binding protein transcription factor is a critical and functionally relevant ets factor that regulates rprl promoter activity via the bte site  <cit> . hif- <dig> exerts an antiapoptotic role in hp <dig> in hypoxia  <cit> . tfdp <dig> was identified in pituitary for the first time, and only highly espressed in human testis, thymus and fetal pituitary according to our studies . it was reported as an inhibitor of e2f-induced apoptosis  <cit> .

 <dig> novel ests were produced in human fetal pituitary. they are all singletons which no est was matched in a blast against the nonredundant est database at ncbi. it is suggested that they are potential new genes, proteins and micrornas that need to be investigated in the future. for example, cd <dig> was located on human dna sequence from clone rp11-123k <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  jointed by 13118– <dig>  26649– <dig>  29319– <dig>  and 39381– <dig>  the others such as cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> were found to reside in the introns of various genes. and their tissue expression patterns show that some novel ests exist particularly in fetal pituitary cells. it is indicated that est sequencing is an efficient method for gene discovery and expression level analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the transcriptome approaches used in this study indicate some novel clues in human pituitary development. of these, sox <dig> and some novel ests are suggested to have important roles in pituitary development. thus, the est data was effective for identifying a comprehensive gene expression profile. it may lay the foundation for further investigation of the molecular mechanisms of human pituitary development and function.
