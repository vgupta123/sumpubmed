BACKGROUND
in recent years, the emergence of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative pathogens – including acinetobacter, klebsiella, and pseudomonas – has become a serious global concern  <cit> . as the treatment options for these bacteria become increasingly limited, scientists and clinicians alike have turned to bacteriophage  therapy as a possible alternative to antibiotic delivery. by preventing and/or treating infections with phages – viruses that specifically infect bacteria – one can target pathogens that are resistant to conventional drug treatment while avoiding possible antibiotic side effects, such as disruption of the patient’s normal flora  <cit> . phages infecting the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa have already been shown to be safe for human administration in multiple volunteer and phase i trials  <cit> . although relatively little data are currently available for controlled human efficacy studies, a recent phase i/ii trial showed that p. aeruginosa-specific phages were clinically active  <cit> .

the burkholderia cepacia complex  is a group of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative species that also appear to be a promising target for phage therapy. these bacteria cause transmissible and potentially fatal opportunistic infections in cystic fibrosis  and immunocompromised patients. similar to p. aeruginosa, bcc bacteria are innately antibiotic-resistant owing to a variety of mechanisms . antibiotics such as meropenem, minocycline, and ceftazidime show partial efficacy against some clinical isolates, but the vast majority of strains are not susceptible to even the administration of multiple drugs  <cit> . although phage therapy for burkholderia species has not yet reached clinical trials, preliminary studies have shown it to be safe and effective in the protection of crop seedlings and in both invertebrate and mammalian infection models  <cit> .

one of the most important aspects of phage therapy development is the selection of appropriate therapeutic phage candidates. to be clinically applicable, a phage should have a broad host range  and a sequenced and characterized genome that lacks genes encoding putative pathogenicity factors and lysogeny-related proteins . identifying bcc-specific phages that meet all of the above criteria has thus far proven challenging, particularly with respect to lysogeny genes. although several phages have been isolated and characterized that have a broad host range  and no virulence genes, almost all of these phages are temperate or encode proteins required for this lifestyle  <cit> . bcc-specific phages that are obligately lytic  are thus far suboptimal for phage therapy development because they either infect only environmental isolates   <cit>  or have genomes that are either not sequenced or not published   <cit> . although we have shown that bcc phages can be engineered to an obligately lytic form, such mutants can be difficult to construct and could potentially encounter additional hurdles with respect to regulatory approval  <cit> . as a result of these obstacles, a key objective of bcc phage isolation and characterization studies is to isolate naturally occurring obligately lytic phages that infect clinical strains and lack putative virulence or lysogeny genes. here, we describe and characterize the complete genome sequence of podovirus jg <dig>  a novel phage possessing each of these characteristics. furthermore, using a well-characterized invertebrate infection model  <cit> , we show that this phage is active against burkholderia cenocepacia in vivo, providing further evidence that jg <dig> and other related phages are appropriate candidates for clinical development.

RESULTS
isolation, host range, and morphology
jg <dig>  was isolated from a sewage processing plant using an uncharacterized strain of burkholderia dolosa. additional jg <dig> hosts were identified using spot tests and soft-agar overlays of bcc strains. a total of  <dig> strains were tested and seven were found to support lytic propagation of jg <dig> : burkholderia multivorans atcc  <dig> , burkholderia cenocepacia k56- <dig> , j <dig> , and pc <dig> , burkholderia stabilis lmg  <dig> , and burkholderia dolosa au <dig>  and cep <dig> . excluding the soil isolate atcc  <dig>  each of these strains was identified as a cf clinical isolate  <cit> . furthermore, the three susceptible b. cenocepacia strains and au <dig> have all been linked to epidemic spread among cf patients  <cit> . this host range is relatively broad, clinically relevant, and distinct compared to the tropism of bcc phages that we have previously characterized  <cit> . on k56- <dig>  jg <dig> forms large clear plaques, 1– <dig> mm in diameter.

several bcc phages – including ks <dig>  ks <dig>  ks <dig>  ks <dig>  and ks <dig> – have been previously shown to use lipopolysaccharide  as a receptor  <cit> , abdu and juárez lara, unpublished data]. to assess if jg <dig> uses a similar receptor, a panel of both k56- <dig>  <cit>  and pc <dig>  lps mutants were tested with the phage in spot tests. in k56- <dig> mutants, jg <dig>  less efficiently infected wbxe and waal mutants  and did not infect wabr, wabs, wabo, or waac mutants . in pc <dig> , this jg <dig> stock less efficiently infected a wabp mutant  and did not infect wabo or waac mutants . as jg <dig> does not infect mutants with significant deficits in the core lps structure, the tail of this phage likely interacts with the lps core of k56- <dig>  pc <dig>  and potentially other hosts. as noted in a previous bcc phage study, further experiments are required to validate this prediction as lps truncation may also result in secondary changes to the cell surface structure of the mutants  <cit> .

electron microscopy of jg <dig> virions  shows that this phage has a short tail and belongs to the c <dig> morphotype of the order caudovirales and family podoviridae <cit> . this morphology is relatively rare for a bcc phage as the only burkholderia podoviruses identified to date are the bpp-1-like bcepc6b and the bcep22-like dc <dig>  bcep <dig>  bcepil <dig>  and bcepmigl  <cit> . the jg <dig> capsid is icosahedral and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm in diameter .

genome sequencing and assembly
in order to determine if the genome sequence of jg <dig> was novel, several ecori genomic dna fragments were cloned into puc <dig> and sequenced. resulting reads were analyzed using blastn and found to be similar  to a variety of sequences, including those from previously characterized podoviruses. the genome sequence was completed using ion semiconductor technology on the ion torrent platform. a total of  <dig>  ×  <dig> sequence reads were aligned into a single contig with over 400-fold coverage. regions of ambiguity and genome ends were analyzed using sanger sequencing.

the jg <dig> genome is  <dig>  bp in length and has a  <dig> % gc content. based on the similarity of the sequence to characterized ϕkmv-like autographivirinae genomes , the chromosomal termini of jg <dig> are likely to be short direct terminal repeats  as canonically found in t <dig>  <cit> . to identify these termini, jg <dig> dna was directly sequenced using primers that bind the following four loci: within the left dtr, extending to the left terminus; immediately outside of the left dtr, extending to the left terminus; within the right dtr, extending to the right terminus; and immediately outside of the right dtr, extending to the right terminus. primers that bind within the left dtr will amplify both the left and right ends of the genome simultaneously . a reduction to one-half intensity in the sequence chromatogram represents the arrest of half of the reads  at the left chromosome terminus  <cit> . primers that bind immediately outside of the left dtr will amplify only the left end of the genome  and the sequence chromatogram will stop abruptly at the left chromosome terminus  <cit> . the same reasoning is true for primers binding within or near the right dtr. using these methods, it was determined that the chromosomal termini of jg <dig> are  <dig> bp dtrs with an identical sequence on each end. the length of these repeats is shorter than that of other ϕkmv-like autographivirinae such as lkd <dig> , ϕkmv , lka <dig> , and limelight   <cit> .

in ϕkmv, genome replication is bidirectional with the origin and terminus in the dna polymerase gene and an internal virion protein gene, respectively  <cit> . using genskew analysis, a global co-minimum gc skew was identified in the jg <dig> dna polymerase gene  <dig> and a global maximum skew was identified in the internal virion protein gene  <dig>  suggesting that the replication process of jg <dig> is similar to that of other ϕkmv-like autographivirinae. in addition to the chromosomal termini and the putative replication origin, a third commonality with respect to the dna of this genus of phages is that the jg <dig> genome lacks recognition sites for many common restriction enzymes, including bamhi, bglii, psti, saci, smai, and xhoi. as in other phages, including those that are ϕkmv-like, these sites tend to be lost as the phage evolves to avoid host restriction systems  <cit> .

relatedness
when the sequence of jg <dig> is analyzed using blastn, the most similar sequences  are those of ralstonia phage ϕrsb <dig>  a genetic locus of blood disease bacterium r <dig>  a genetic locus of burkholderia pseudomallei 1710b chromosome  <dig>  and caulobacter phage cd <dig>  in the blastn results, jg <dig> shows similarity to several members of the autographivirinae subfamily and ϕkmv-like phages genus, including ϕrsb <dig>  cd <dig>  and pseudomonas phage bf <dig>  members of this subfamily  belong to one of several genera, including the t7-like phages, sp6-like phages, ϕkmv-like phages, and novel genera that have not yet been named  <cit> . these podoviruses all encode a single subunit rna polymerase, as is found in jg <dig>  <cit> . to determine if jg <dig> belongs to this subfamily , we used coregenesuniquegenes  analysis to compare the genomes of jg <dig>  t <dig> , sp <dig> , and ϕkmv   <cit> . using t <dig>  sp <dig>  or ϕkmv as the reference genome, the proteins of jg <dig> were  <dig> %,  <dig> %, or  <dig> % similar, respectively. as ≥40% similarity indicates a genus-level relationship  <cit> , we can conclude that jg <dig> is a novel member of the autographivirinae subfamily and the ϕkmv-like phages genus. as noted above, the few bcc podoviruses that have been previously characterized are either bcep22-like or bpp-1-like  <cit> , thus jg <dig> is the first bcc autographivirinae phage to be identified.

genome annotation
the jg <dig> genome contains  <dig> putative open reading frames  . similar to t <dig> and other autographivirinae, all of the genes are transcribed in the forward direction  <cit> . based on blastp analysis ,  <dig> jg <dig> proteins show no similarity to other proteins in the database . the remaining  <dig> proteins have percent identities between 29%  and 64%  , thus showing low-to-moderate similarity to other sequences at the protein level.

blastp hits with an e-value < <dig>  were included in the table.

similar to other phages, the jg <dig> genome has a modular organization. in both t <dig> and ϕkmv, class i early genes are clustered on the left end of the genome, class ii genes for dna-binding proteins are found centrally, and class iii genes for virion morphogenesis and lysis are positioned on the right end  <cit> . the overall organization of jg <dig> is syntenic with both of these phages: left end genes encode hypothetical proteins, central genes encode dna-binding proteins, and right end genes encode capsid morphogenesis and dna packaging, tail morphogenesis, and lysis proteins . using btxpred analysis  combined with blastp and hhpred comparisons , no putative virulence modules were detected, indicating that jg <dig> is likely to be a safe candidate for clinical testing.

hhpred hits with a probability >90% were included in the table.

a module commonly identified in other bcc phages that is notably absent from the jg <dig> genome is that for lysogeny. similar to other obligately lytic phages, jg <dig> forms clear plaques and does not encode either an integrase or a repressor. most other characterized members of the autographivirinae are also virulent   <cit> . in order to verify experimentally that jg <dig> was not capable of lysogenizing bcc strains, we isolated jg068-insensitive k56- <dig> from a jg068/k56- <dig> lysate. to determine if these cells were insensitive due to either receptor mutation or superinfection immunity, we attempted to lyse these isolates using a second putatively virulent bcc-specific phage, ks <dig>  previous assays have shown that ks <dig> uses lps as a receptor . if jg068-insensitive k56- <dig> isolates are also insensitive to ks <dig> infection, they are likely lps mutants, whereas if they are sensitive to ks <dig> infection, they are likely jg <dig> lysogens. over  <dig> jg068-insensitive isolates were screened and all were found to be insensitive to both phages compared to wildtype k56- <dig>  twelve resistant colonies were pcr-screened using jg068-specific primers and each isolate was found to be amplification-negative. this evidence shows that resistance arises due to receptor mutation and not due to jg <dig> lysogeny.

in autographivirinae, transcription is first initiated from host promoters found at the far left-hand side of the genome, followed by initiation from phage rna polymerase-specific promoters found throughout the genome  <cit> . jg <dig> promoters putatively recognized by bcc rna polymerase were identified using neural network promoter prediction. using a cutoff of  <dig>  and limiting the results to sequences found intergenically, three promoters were identified in the first  <dig> bp downstream of the left dtr . phage promoters lack the conserved structure observed in bacterial promoters with - <dig> and - <dig> regions and are instead described as short consensus sequences that vary among different phages  <cit> . phire was used to identify a strongly conserved  <dig> bp consensus sequence  found six times at five intergenic loci in the jg <dig> chromosome: overlapping the first host promoter sequence, upstream of the dna polymerase gene  <dig> , upstream of the hypothetical protein gene  <dig> , upstream of the capsid gene  <dig>  and upstream of the tail fiber gene  <dig> . putative rho-independent terminators were identified using transtermhp. although multiple sequences were reported in the output, those shown in figure 3c were chosen because they were intergenic  and had a Δg value of - <dig> kcal/mol or less. similar to limezero, the putative terminators are found upstream of the dna-binding module and downstream of the capsid protein   <cit> .

module analysis
dna-binding proteins
one of the more notable aspects of the jg <dig> genome is its abundance of dna-binding proteins. as discussed above, similar to t <dig> and ϕkmv, these genes are found centrally in the jg <dig> genome . in jg <dig> and other ϕkmv-like phages  <cit> , the rna polymerase gene is at the far right end of this module , whereas in t <dig> it is found close to the left end of the genome  <cit> . jg <dig> dna-binding proteins include the primase gp <dig>  helicase gp <dig>  ligase gp <dig>  dna polymerase gp <dig>  hnh endonuclease gp <dig>  exonuclease gp <dig>  endonuclease gp <dig>  exonuclease gp <dig>  and rna polymerase gp <dig> . the annotation of each of these proteins was based on blastp analysis and subsequently confirmed using hhpred .

one of the unifying features of the autographivirinae is the presence of a single-subunit phage rna polymerase gene  <cit> . based on cgug analysis, the only jg <dig> dna-binding protein that shows similarity to those of t <dig> is this polymerase. these two proteins have 31% identity based on blastp analysis. in contrast, almost all of the jg <dig> dna-binding proteins are similar to proteins in ϕkmv with 29-48% identity. furthermore, these genes are found in the same order in these two phages.

the three components within this module that are dissimilar between ϕkmv and jg <dig> are the genes encoding the ligase, hnh endonuclease, and dna binding protein. in ϕkmv, a ligase gene is found between the helicase and dna polymerase , but the sequences of these genes are dissimilar between the two phages  <cit> . several hnh homing endonuclease genes have been identified in t <dig>  <cit> , but only one is found in jg <dig> and none have been identified in ϕkmv. although a dna binding protein gene was identified upstream of the helicase gene in ϕkmv  <cit> , such a gene was not identified in the jg <dig> annotation.

the position of the promoters driving the expression of genes in this module also differs between these phages. in ϕkmv, promoters upstream of these genes include four host promoters and two phage promoters   <cit> . in contrast, whereas the host promoters for jg <dig> are found at a similar locus as in ϕkmv, the phage promoters either overlap the host promoters or are found between the ligase  and dna polymerase  genes . based on this arrangement, all of the ϕkmv genes in this module could be expressed from internal phage promoters , whereas the primase , helicase , and ligase  genes of jg <dig> would be expressed from either a host promoter or the nested phage promoter on the far left end .

morphogenesis proteins
the structural proteins of ϕkmv, lka <dig>  and lkd <dig> have been identified using mass spectrometry of proteins from purified virions  <cit> . based on cgug analysis, jg <dig> encodes proteins similar to the majority of these structural proteins. the putative structural genes 32– <dig>  are contained in a single  <dig> kbp module . in a cgug comparison of ϕkmv and jg <dig>  the head-tail connector , capsid protein , tail tubular protein a  and b , internal virion proteins , and tail fiber protein  are all similar and each of these proteins was shown to be structural in ϕkmv virions  <cit> . in addition, when jg <dig> and lka <dig> are compared using cgug, a third internal virion protein  is identified as similar that is structural in lka <dig>  <cit> . ϕkmv, lka <dig>  and lkd <dig> virions also contain some proteins not encoded similarly by jg <dig>  the genes encoding these structural proteins are found either upstream of the head-tail connector gene or downstream of the tail fiber gene and have uncharacterized functions or are putatively involved in adsorption  <cit> . based on our genome annotation, jg <dig> does not encode any additional unique structural proteins.

additional head morphogenesis/dna packaging and tail morphogenesis proteins are encoded by jg <dig> that are not predicted to be associated with the mature virion. although the scaffolding protein gp <dig> is encoded within the structural module discussed above, it is likely to function in capsid assembly but not to be part of the mature virion based on ϕkmv, lka <dig>  and lkd <dig> structural protein analysis  <cit> . dissimilar to many other phages   <cit> , the dna packaging genes  <dig> and  <dig> are found far downstream of the head morphogenesis genes . gp <dig>  gp <dig>  and gp <dig> are all similar to proteins of ϕkmv based on cgug analysis. the only putative morphogenesis protein that is unique to jg <dig> and not shared by ϕkmv or lka <dig> is the putative tail fiber assembly protein gp <dig>  although hhpred analysis was uninformative , this protein shows similarity in blastp analysis to tail fiber assembly proteins of cupriavidus necator n- <dig>  dickeya dadantii  <dig>  and idiomarina xiamenensis 10-d- <dig> 

lysis proteins
the lysis proteins of jg <dig>  encoded on the far right end of the genome, include a putative pinholin, signal-arrest-release  endolysin, rz, and rz <dig>  although the lysis genes in most phages  tend to be arranged in a single block with the holin gene followed by the endolysin, rz, and rz <dig> genes  <cit> , this order is not maintained in jg <dig>  here, the putative pinholin gene  <dig> is found upstream of the sar endolysin , rz , and rz <dig>  genes, separated by genes encoding two dna packaging proteins and two hypothetical proteins . within the autographivirinae subfamily, this gene arrangement is also observed in sp <dig>  <cit> .

although only two of the four jg <dig> lysis proteins are similar to those of ϕkmv based on cgug analysis , these two phages are likely to use similar lysis mechanisms. the gp <dig> pinholin has analogous features to that of ϕkmv: ~ <dig> amino acids in length , two transmembrane domains , and positively-charged arginine and lysine residues at the c-terminus  <cit> . the gp <dig> rz inner membrane protein has a single n-terminal transmembrane domain based on tmhmm analysis. gene  <dig>  encoding the rz <dig> outer membrane lipoprotein, overlaps with gene  <dig> in the + <dig> reading frame and extends downstream of the  <dig> stop codon by  <dig> base pairs . lipop analysis predicts a signal peptidase ii cleavage site in gp <dig> between residues  <dig>  and  <dig> .

the sar endolysin of jg <dig> has a very similar organization to that of ϕkmv. signalp  <dig>  predicts an n-terminal signal sequence probability of  <dig>  for gp <dig> . the gp <dig> n-terminus contains two signal sequence regions followed by three putative catalytic residues of the lysozyme domain. residues 1– <dig>  including a positively-charged histidine, lysine, and arginine, make up the n-region. residues 8– <dig> make up the hydrophobic glycine- and alanine-rich h-region, also predicted to be a transmembrane domain by octopus analysis. using cd search and blastp alignment with the ϕkmv sar endolysin, the putative lysozyme catalytic residues were identified as 27e, 36d, and 45t, all found immediately downstream of the h-region. as in ϕkmv, because the c-region is absent, the protein will not be cleaved by a signal peptidase upon secretion and will instead remain associated with the inner membrane until release into the periplasm  <cit> .

using inducible expression of the ϕkmv sar endolysin in e. coli, it was shown that this protein could decrease culture absorbance in the absence of a pinholin, but only if the n-terminal signal sequence of the endolysin was present  <cit> . we performed a similar experiment using the jg <dig> sar endolysin to further characterize the export mechanism and biological activity of this protein. to allow for tightly controlled inducible expression, we cloned gene  <dig> into pet22b  and transformed these plasmids into e. coli bl21plyss. when these cells  are subcultured, their growth rates prior to iptg induction are similar based on optical density measurements at  <dig> nm . however, following induction, expression of gp <dig> is lethal to the cells as the od <dig> decreases from ~ <dig>  at  <dig> hours to ~ <dig>  at  <dig> hours . a very different trend is observed for the blank control, gp47Δss, and uninduced gp <dig> strains, where the od <dig> increases from ~ <dig>  at  <dig> hours to ~ <dig>  at  <dig> hours, double that of the induced gp <dig> od <dig> . as the lytic activity is dependent upon expression of not only the lysozyme domain but also the signal sequence, we can conclude that jg <dig> gp <dig> acts as a typical sar endolysin in gram-negative bacteria. while the classical endolysins of bcep781/bcep <dig> and bcepc6b have been functionally characterized  <cit> , this is the first experimental evidence for sar endolysin activity in a bcc phage. as these proteins have also been identified in the bcep22-like viruses  <cit> , similar experiments may be used to confirm the activity of sar endolysins in these phages as well.

in vivo activity
the galleria mellonella  larvae model is commonly used to assess both strain virulence and phage therapy efficacy for members of the bcc, particularly b. cenocepacia <cit> . although this model is less complex than a mammalian system, it shows positive correlation with both mouse and rat models of infection  <cit> . to determine if jg <dig> possesses lytic activity against b. cenocepacia in vivo, we infected g. mellonella larvae with  <dig>  ×  <dig> colony forming units  of k56- <dig> and treated with endotoxin-removed jg <dig> at a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig> . for infected, untreated controls, no larvae survived after  <dig> hours . those larvae that received only jg <dig> remained healthy over the course of the experiment , indicating that phage treatment produced no harmful effects. for infected, treated larvae, jg <dig> administration significantly increased survival to an average of 77%  . in a previous study, the putatively virulent phage ks <dig> was the most effective for immediate treatment of k56- <dig> infection in the g. mellonella model, resulting in 93 ± 12% survival  or 57 ± 6% survival   <cit> . based on the g. mellonella data presented in figure  <dig>  jg <dig> is almost as effective as a significantly larger dose of ks <dig>  indicating that jg <dig> is highly active in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
one of the greatest challenges in bcc phage therapy development is the identification of phages with a broad, clinically relevant host range that are free of virulence genes, obligately lytic, and active in vivo. our characterization of the podovirus jg <dig> indicates that it is a rare example of a bcc phage that satisfies each of these requirements. jg <dig> infects strains of b. multivorans, b. cenocepacia , b. stabilis, and b. dolosa. it is the first bcc virus to be identified as a member of the autographivirinae subfamily and ϕkmv-like phages genus. the  <dig>  bp genome sequence has a structure similar to that of other autographivirinae chromosomes, with dtrs and genes encoding dna-binding, morphogenesis, and lysis proteins expressed in the forward direction from phage and host promoters. jg <dig> lacks virulence genes, is obligately lytic, and encodes a functional sar endolysin, the first to be experimentally verified for the bcc. administration of jg <dig> to b. cenocepacia k56-2-infected g. mellonella larvae significantly decreases larval mortality, providing the first evidence that sequenced, obligately lytic bcc phages are active against b. cenocepacia in vivo. given these characteristics, further study is warranted regarding the development of jg <dig> into an active antimicrobial for use in cf patients.
