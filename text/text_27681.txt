BACKGROUND
the phytohormone auxin is crucial to control plant growth and development. at the cellular level, auxin regulates cell division, cell expansion, and cellular differentiation  <cit> . auxin largely exerts its action through a multistep signaling pathway: aux/iaa proteins are repressors of the auxin response factor  transcription factors. auxin directly binds to the nuclear co-receptors transport inhitor response/auxin f-box protein  and the aux/iaa. auxin binding causes the subsequent degradation of aux/iaa transcriptional repressors  <cit> . subsequently, auxin perception leads to the de-repression of the arf transcription factors, initiating transcriptional reprogramming.

the spatial and temporal distribution of auxins depends on auxin metabolism  and the activity of cellular auxin transporters  <cit> . to date, various auxin carriers have been identified  <cit> , among which the most prominent are auxin influx carriers of the auxin resistant1/like aux <dig>  class, abc transporters of the multidrug resistance  subfamily, and pin-formed  auxin carriers  <cit> . pharmacological and genetic interference with auxin carriers have illustrated the importance of auxin transport mechanisms for various aspects of plant development  <cit> . in particular, classical auxin transport inhibitors, such as 1-naphthylphthalamic acid   <cit> , are valuable tools to assess various auxin carrier-mediated developmental processes. typically, auxin carriers mediate the cellular auxin import or export at the plasma membrane and, thus, regulate the auxin availability for nuclear auxin signaling . however, recently, a subclass of pin proteins, such as pin <dig> and pin <dig>  has been shown to reside at the endoplasmic reticulum  and to control cellular auxin homeostasis presumably via the regulation of intracellular auxin compartmentalization into the er lumen  <cit> . yet another evolutionary distinct pin-likes  putative auxin carrier family functions at the er, indicating broad developmental and evolutionary importance of intracellular auxin transport  <cit> .

the transport capacity of a multitude of auxin carriers and their sensitivity to auxin transport inhibitors has been analyzed in plant cell systems, such as arabidopsis protoplasts or bright yellow- <dig>  cell cultures of tobacco , and in heterologous cell systems, such as yeast and mammalian cells  <cit> . these elaborate auxin transport assays are important tools to study transport activities and mechanisms. however, it would be desirable to develop easier methods to asses auxin carrier activity. an alternative approach has been proposed for the indirect visualization of the carrier-driven auxin homeostasis  <cit> . this bioassay utilizes the stimulating effect of free auxin levels on root hair elongation. the root hair-specific expression of an auxin carrier and its action on the root hair length is used to indirectly visualize carrier driven auxin homeostasis. however, auxin fluxes in neighboring tissues also contribute to the regulation of root hair growth  <cit> , preventing the combined use of ectopic carrier expression and its sensitivity to auxin transport inhibitors. moreover, the time-consuming generation of stable transgenic lines might limit the use of this bioassay for high-throughput applications.

another frequently used tool to monitor auxin signaling is the synthetic, highly auxin responsive promoter dr <dig>  created by tandem repeats of the auxin responsive element  from the soybean gh <dig> promoter  <cit> . previously, the dr <dig> promoter activity has been suggested to indicate the relative rate of nuclear auxin signaling in various tissues  <cit> . dr <dig> has been used to visualize auxin signaling maxima and minima which, however, do not correlate in all cells with the actual auxin levels possibly due to cell type-dependent cues  <cit> .

here, we present a novel single cell based system, using the dr <dig> promoter, to address cellular mechanisms that affect cellular auxin homeostasis and ultimately auxin signaling. we show the correlation between dr <dig> promoter activity and fluctuations in cellular auxin levels in tobacco by- <dig> cells. our data suggest that the transient expression of dr5rev:monomeric red fluorescent protein  reporter for nuclear auxin signaling can be used to illustrate the relative state of cellular auxin signaling in tobacco by- <dig> cells. by means of this single-cell-based system, the relative auxin carrier induced changes in cellular auxin signaling were monitored, indirectly indicating auxin carrier activity. as a proof of concept, we assessed the prominent pin auxin carrier activity and confirmed their effects on cellular auxin homeostasis/signaling  <cit> . moreover, a pharmacological approach revealed that the activity regulation of pin <dig> at the plasma membrane and pin <dig> at the er are distinct. furthermore, we show that this single-cell-based system could be analogously used to investigate other putative carriers, such as pils and wat <dig>  or potentially even other hormonal pathways, such as cytokinin.

RESULTS
indirect visualization of auxin carrier activity in tobacco by- <dig> cells
in previous studies, the synthetic auxin-responsive promoter element dr <dig> fused to the monomeric rfp or gfp reporter gene   <cit>  was used to visualize the auxin response maxima within tissues and it was proposed to indirectly estimate auxin distribution  <cit> . however, auxin distribution and dr5-based auxin signaling does not always correlate in plant tissues presumably due to cell type-dependent cues  <cit> .

to reduce cell type dependent effects, we tested whether the dr <dig> promoter could be used in tobacco by- <dig> cell cultures to indirectly estimate auxin carrier activity. in order to address the correlation between auxin carrier activity and dr <dig> promoter activity in tobacco by- <dig> cells, we stably transformed the dr5rev:mrfp construct into transgenic by- <dig> lines carrying the construct for inducible pin1gfp <cit>  or pin <dig> <cit>  expression. pin <dig> and pin <dig> are plasma membrane localized auxin efflux carriers important for plant growth and development  <cit> . induction of pin1gfp and pin <dig>  which causes cellular auxin depletion  <cit> , decreased dr5rev:mrfp signal intensity compared to non-induced cells, reflecting lower nuclear auxin signaling . the dr5rev:rfp signal intensity is represented by the average mean gray value  of the induced cell population  relative to the average mgv of the uninduced control population .

within the estradiol induced pin1-gfp expressing by- <dig> cell population, we observed a negative correlation between dr5rev:mrfp and pin1-gfp signal intensity , suggesting lower levels of nuclear auxin signaling in case of high pin1-gfp activity.

to unambiguously depict auxin carrier activity of pin1-gfp and pin <dig>  we performed auxin accumulation assays on the same cell lines and observed lower accumulation of the radiolabelled synthetic auxin 1-naphtylacetic acid  in estradiol induced pin1-gfp expressing cells compared to non-induced cells . our findings indicate that dr5rev:mrfp signal intensity  correlates with cellular auxin accumulation , presumably due to carrier induced changes in cellular auxin content and subsequent alterations in auxin signaling.

we conclude that under our experimental conditions the dr <dig> promoter activity can be used in by- <dig> cells to indirectly visualize auxin carrier-dependent regulation of cellular auxin homeostasis.

procedure for transient auxin carrier expression in a single-cell-based system
in by- <dig> cells, the visualization of auxin signaling could be used to indirectly monitor carrier driven cellular auxin homeostasis. to establish a medium-to-high throughput assay, we elaborated on procedures to transiently express auxin carriers. particle bombardment is an easy to use procedure that enables high transformation efficiencies at low plasmid concentrations and has, in case of partial automatization, the potential for high-throughput use  <cit> . we adjusted the previously described particle bombardment procedure  <cit>  for efficient, transient tobacco by- <dig> transformation . to obtain high protein expression levels, by- <dig> cell cultures in the exponential growth phase were used. dna concentrations ranging from  <dig>  μg/μl to  <dig> μg/μl were sufficient for transient expression and resulted in a correlation between dna concentration and expression levels, allowing fine-tuning of the gene expression . the co-transformation efficiency was tested by transformation of two plasmids at different concentration ratios and the co-transformation levels were calculated . although dependent on concentration, in general the co-transformation efficiency was very high , enabling the two plasmids to be efficiently co-transformed . thus, by- <dig> particle bombardment can be used as a suitable method to efficiently co-express genes of interest.

transient single-cell-based-system to monitor auxin signaling
to initially test whether the transient dr <dig> expression in by- <dig> cells could be used to visualize qualitative differences in levels of auxin signaling between two samples of interest, we transiently co-transformed tobacco by- <dig> cells with the auxin responsive dr5rev:mrfp construct and the stabilized auxin signaling repressor iaa17mimii fused to the activator domain of the herpes simplex virus vp <dig>  this construct leads to constitutive auxin signaling in plant cells  <cit> . as expected, the mean gray value  of dr5rev:mrfp  was higher in cells co-transformed with dr5rev:mrfp and 35s:vp16iaa17mimii than in control cells expressing dr5rev:mrfp and the inert endoplasmic reticulum  marker 35s:hdelgfp . to further elaborate on the relative changes in dr5/auxin signaling, we subdivided the transformed cell population in  <dig> classes according to the relative mgv. individual cells were scored as low  with a relative mgv below  <dig>  , medium  with a relative mgv above  <dig>   and below  <dig> , high  with a relative mgv between  <dig>  and  <dig>  and very high  with a relative mgv value higher than  <dig> . . this alternative visualization allows us to trace the shifts in relative cell numbers with low, medium, high and very high rfp signal intensity between two samples and to compare even more subtle differences in dr5rev:mrfp signal intensities. 35s:vp16-iaa17mimii enhanced auxin signaling in our system and accordingly reduced the relative cell numbers with low/medium and increased the cell numbers with strong, or very strong rfp signal intensity .

these findings indicate that the transient dr5rev:mrfp expression in by- <dig> cells can be used to monitor the qualitative differences in nuclear auxin signaling.

next, we examined whether our single-cell-based system can be used to address mechanisms of auxin transport. therefore we treated the dr5rev:mrfp-transformed cell population with the auxin transport inhibitor npa that reduces cellular auxin efflux and, hence, increases cellular auxin levels  <cit> . as expected, npa treatment significantly increased the relative rate of dr <dig> signaling in our transient assay , revealing that npa action on cellular auxin efflux and cellular auxin homeostasis can be monitored in our single-cell-based system.

our findings suggest that the dr5- and single-cell-based system can be used to qualitatively monitor changes in auxin signaling. however, in order to use this system in a meaningful way, the experimental design needs to be carefully chosen, because dr <dig> activity has been suggested not to solely reflect auxin signaling. the phytohormone brassinolide affects the expression of several auxin responsive genes as well as the activity of the dr <dig> promoter in arabidopsis thaliana <cit>  . nevertheless, in our experimental conditions, brassinolide treatment did not increase the average mgv of dr5rev:mrfp transformed tobacco by- <dig> cells . this finding indicates that either brassinosteroids do not increase auxin signaling in by- <dig> cells or that our approach is not sensitive enough to trace subtle differences, such as brassinosteroid-induced auxin signaling.

auxin carrier trafficking and localization in the single-cell-based system
to further assess the usability of the method, we studied the effect of the pin auxin carrier activity on the cellular auxin signaling. initially, a time-frame of presumably high pin protein activity was defined by investigating the pin trafficking/localization after transient by- <dig> transformation. transmembrane proteins, such as pin proteins, are co-translationally inserted into the er membrane. plasma membrane-localized pin proteins, such as pin <dig>  are exported subsequently from the er and sorted to the plasma membrane  <cit> . in contrast, pin <dig> proteins remain at the er membrane, where they function as regulators of cellular auxin homeostasis  <cit> .

ten hours after transformation, we observed colocalization of pin1-rfp with the inert er marker hdel:gfp in most of the transformed cells  , implying high levels of newly synthesized pin proteins, whereas  <dig> h after transformation, in most analyzed cells, pin1-rfp was absent from the er and solely visible  at the plasma membrane  where it is active  <cit> . afterwards, the percentage of cells with a strong pin1-rfp signal at the plasma membrane diminished over time . this decrease in pin <dig> localization at the plasma membrane correlated with an increase of the pin1-rfp occurrence in the vacuole , hinting at a pin <dig> turnover by lytic degradation  <cit> .

altogether, pin <dig> proteins displayed a pronounced localization and, presumably, high activity at the plasma membrane between 16 h-18 h after transformation. at that time point , also other pin proteins, such as pin2-gfp and pin5-gfp, strongly localized at the plasma membrane and er , respectively. we conclude  <dig> h to  <dig> h as a suitable time frame for the analysis of pin auxin carrier activity.

activity of the pin auxin transport proteins affects auxin signaling
next, we investigated the effect of the pin auxin carrier activity on the cellular auxin signaling using the dr5- and single-cell-based system. cells cotransformed with dr5rev:mrfp and 35s:pin2-gfp had a lower dr5rev:mrfp signal intensity than the control cells expressing dr5rev:mrfp and the inert er marker 35s:hdel-gfp . these observations are in agreement with the pin induced decrease in cellular auxin accumulation  and indicate a decreased auxin signaling due to the enhanced pin2-auxin efflux carrier activity at the plasma membrane.

pin <dig> is an er localized auxin carrier described to facilitate auxin transport from the cytosol into the er. this auxin sequestration into the er presumably reduces the availability of auxin for nuclear auxin signaling  <cit> . in agreement with these assumptions, the pin5gfp expression caused a significant decrease in the dr5rev:mrfp signal intensity .

we conclude that the dr5- and single-cell-based system can be used to indirectly monitor the activity of plasma membrane and er localized pin auxin transporters.

auxin transport inhibitor npa inhibits pin <dig>  but not pin <dig> action in the single cell system
as described above, the expression of pin2gfp facilitates the auxin efflux from cells and, hence, lowers the levels of intracellular auxin signaling . after treatment with the auxin transport inhibitor npa, pin <dig> expression did not decrease auxin signaling compared to npa treated hdelgfp expressing control cells . importantly, npa did not visibly affect the transient pin <dig> localization at the plasma membrane , indicating that our single-cell-based system monitors the inhibitory effect of npa on the auxin transport activity of pin <dig>  <cit> .

in contrast to pin <dig>  the pin5gfp expression  reduced the auxin signaling even in the presence of npa . this difference in npa sensitivity indicates that the mechanisms of npa action and/or auxin transport mechanisms of pin <dig> and pin <dig> are distinct. this finding is in agreement with a npa binding activity at the plasma membrane  <cit> . to further assess the npa insensitivity of putative auxin carriers at the er, we analyzed pils putative auxin carrier activity in our system. pils <dig> localizes to the er and was recently described to decrease nuclear auxin signaling presumably due to auxin sequestration into the er  <cit> . similar to pin <dig>  we observed a pils <dig> dependent decrease in dr <dig> signaling in the presence of npa . hence, we assume that npa inhibits intercellular, but not intracellular auxin transport at the er in by- <dig> cell cultures.

we conclude that the single-cell-based system is a sensitive approach not only to monitor the carrier-driven auxin homeostasis, but also to assess the auxin carrier sensitivity to auxin transport inhibitors. these data demonstrate that our transient approach can be used to investigate the genetic or pharmacological interferences with auxin carrier function.

wat <dig> protein activity affects cellular auxin homeostasis
to assess whether the approach is suitable to monitor also the activity of other putative transporters, we co-expressed dr5rev:mrfp with walls are thin <dig>  . wat <dig> is a tonoplast-localized transmembrane protein that belongs to the drug/metabolite transporter superfamily. wat <dig> activity has an impact on auxin homeostasis by affecting tryptophan and/or auxin metabolism via an unknown mechanism  <cit> . we used our single-cell-based system to investigate whether wat <dig> affects the cellular auxin signaling in by- <dig> cells. cells co-transformed with dr5rev:mrfp and 35s:wat1:gfp had a lower dr5rev:mrfp signal intensity than control cells expressing dr5rev:mrfp and 35s:gfp:gfp , implying a negative effect of wat <dig> protein activity on nuclear auxin signaling. these data show that our single-cell-based system visualizes the effect of wat <dig> on cellular auxin homeostasis and that it could be in principle used to indirectly asses the activity of a wide range of carrier proteins.

indirect visualization of the cellular cytokinin homeostasis
as the single-cell-based system enables the indirect monitoring of carrier driven cellular auxin homeostasis, we tested whether the method could be used analogously for other hormonal pathways. the synthetic cytokinin-responsive promoter two-component-output-sensor :gfp was expressed transiently in tobacco by- <dig> cells for indirect visualization of the cellular cytokinin signaling  <cit> . the distribution characteristics of the cells transiently transformed with tcs:gfp were similar to those previously observed for dr5rev:mrfp. analogously, we measured the average mgv of the transformed cell population and furthermore categorized the cells in subpopulations with very strong, strong, medium, and low tcs:gfp signal intensity . the tcs:gfp activity was higher in transformants treated with 6-benzylaminopurine , a native aromatic cytokinin  <cit> , than in those grown in standard cultivation medium , suggesting an enhanced cytokinin signaling in by- <dig> cells upon cytokinin application.

these results suggest that our single-cell-based system could eventually be extended to other applications, such as the indirect visualization of cellular cytokinin signaling.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the phytohormone auxin plays a key role in many aspects of plant growth and development. the cellular auxin content is tightly controlled by local auxin metabolism  and auxin transport facilitators  <cit> . whereas the complex interplay of these factors still needs to be unraveled, it is clear that various transporters have pronounced effects on the cellular auxin homeostasis  <cit> . furthermore, the steady release of new annotated genomes increases the number of putative auxin carriers and enables the study of their molecular evolution. the scientific progress in auxin carrier identification emphasizes the growing demand for suitable approaches to assess carrier-driven cellular auxin homeostasis.

here, we present a single-cell-based system that allows us to monitor qualitative differences in nuclear auxin signaling between two samples of interest. thanks to this easy approach, carrier-driven auxin homeostasis and its sensitivity to auxin transport inhibitors can be visualized. the transient approach enables  medium-to-high throughput work flows that can be used for chemical genomic or gain- and loss-of-function screens. the dr5rev:mrfp signal intensity can be easily estimated by measuring the mean grey values. ratiometric imaging of dr <dig> signaling and a constitutive  marker could furthermore increase the sensitivity of the approach. also the usage of the so-called novel auxin signaling sensor  termed dii-venus  <cit>  could be useful to improve the temporal resolution of the system, because dii is not based on gene regulation, but on auxin-dependent protein degradation. for high-throughput work flows, automation, such as qrt-pcr or luciferase-based detection, might be most beneficial.

various transient expression approaches, such as gold particle bombardment, micro-injection, polyethylene glycol -mediated dna uptake, and electroporation of protoplasts  <cit>  have been successfully used to transiently transform plant cells. whereas transient transformation of protoplasts has been proven to be highly efficient in high-throughput work flows, particle bombardment of plant cells might be preferable for investigating auxin carrier activity, because it does not affect the cell wall integrity that might be required for auxin carrier trafficking and function  <cit> . accordingly, here we utilized particle bombardment of by- <dig> cells as a transient transformation system to establish a single-cell-based system to monitor cellular auxin homeostasis.

as a proof of concept, we investigated prominent pin auxin efflux carriers and visualized their action on the cellular auxin signaling. in stably transformed by- <dig> cell lines, we illustrate that pin-dependent reduction in cellular accumulation of exogenous auxin correlates with decreased  nuclear auxin signaling. using the single-cell-based system, we reveal the differential sensitivities of pin <dig>  pin <dig> and pils <dig> to the auxin transport inhibitor npa. under our experimental condition, npa blocks pin <dig> action at the plasma membrane, but does not diminish pin <dig> and pils <dig> function at the er, indicating that auxin transport mechanisms at the plasma membrane and at the er could be partially distinct. these findings are in agreement with the assumption that npa action on auxin carrier activity might be restricted to the plasma membrane  <cit> . as such, npa could be applied to distinguish between intercellular and intracellular auxin transport. we assume that the differential sensitivity of pin <dig> and pin <dig> to npa indicate the suitability of the system for chemical genetic approaches.

besides the analysis on pin <dig>  pin <dig> and pils <dig>  we also confirmed that wat <dig> negatively affects cellular auxin signaling. wat <dig> localizes to the tonoplast and has been suggested to regulate cellular auxin homeostasis  <cit> , possibly by sequestering a yet to be identified auxinic compound into the vacuole. how wat <dig> affects auxin homeostasis is still unclear and the mechanism awaits in-depth characterization. nevertheless, wat <dig> activity could be visualized indirectly with our system that might be helpful to further characterize its functionality.

in summary, we established an easy and useful tool to visualize carrier activities that affect cellular auxin signaling. this complementary method bridges the gap between highly elaborated direct auxin transport assays and indirect approaches such as root hair-based visualization of carrier-driven cellular auxin homeostasis  <cit> . given the transient nature of our approach, it allows, for instance, the rapid and systematic pre-screening of several mutant versions of an auxin carrier of interest. subsequently, interesting candidates could be analyzed in depth in other, more elaborated systems.

this single-cell-based system could be also used to analyze other molecular components involved in auxin homeostasis, such as regulators of the auxin signaling or metabolism. moreover, it could be eventually extended to investigate other hormonal pathways by means of different reporter constructs, such as the cytokinin-responsive element tcs:gfp  <cit> . however, compared to the dr <dig> auxin reporter, further in depth characterization of tcs:gfp activity in by- <dig> cells is needed to use the system analogously.
