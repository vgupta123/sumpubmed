BACKGROUND
the production of functional antibody fragments in e. coli was first described by skerra and plückthun  <cit> . key to this success was production in the periplasm, where the oxidizing environment allows the formation of disulphide bonds. later, the linkage of the variable regions by a 15– <dig> amino acid linker of both fv chains improved the expression of antibody fragments in e. coli  <cit> . however, these so called single chain fragment variable  have the tendency to form aggregates and are relatively unstable over longer periods of time  <cit> . furthermore, some scfvs show a reduced affinity of up to one order of magnitude compared to the corresponding fab fragments  <cit> . only in rare cases have scfvs with a higher affinity than the associated fab been found  <cit> . because they are double the molecular size, and require the production and connection of two different polypeptides with a disulphide bond, folding and assembly of fab fragments in the periplasm of e. coli is less efficient than for scfvs  <cit> . a further disadvantage of fab fragments is the tendency of light chains to form homo-dimers, which are known as bence jones proteins  <cit> . advantages of fab fragments are their high stability in long term storage  <cit>  and their compatibility with common detection antisera without the need for a re-engineering step  <cit> . an antibody design combining stability and assay compatibility of fab fragments with high level bacterial expression of single chain fv fragments would be desirable. the desired antibody fragment should be both suitable for expression as soluble antibody in e. coli and antibody phage display.

currently, most recombinant antibody fragments are generated by antibody phage display. phage display technology is based on the groundbreaking work of smith  <cit> . antibody phage display was first described by huse et al.  <cit>  for the phage lambda and by mccafferty et al.  <cit>  for the m <dig> phage. however, practical use was only achieved by uncoupling antibody gene replication and expression from the phage life cycle by locating them on a separate plasmid  to improve genetic stability, handling, and screening of antibody libraries  <cit> . so far, naive scfv antibody libraries with a theoretical diversity of up to  <dig> independent clones  <cit>  and fab antibody libraries with a size of  <dig>  ×  <dig> clones  <cit>  have been generated as molecular repertoires for phage display selections . antibody phage display is a key technology for the generation of human recombinant antibody fragments for therapy and diagnostics  <cit> .

here, we demonstrate, that the introduction of a polypeptide linker between fd fragment and light chain, resulting in the formation of a single chain fab fragment , can lead to improved production of antibody fragments. we tested the impact of various linker lengths and the presence of the disulphide bond on both the display efficiency on phage and the yield of soluble antibody fragment production in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.

RESULTS
construction of the phal vectors with different antibody formats
the mouse anti hen egg white lysozyme antibody d <dig>   <cit>  was reformated into a scfab with a  <dig> amino acid linker, a scfab- <dig> with a  <dig> amino acid linker, a scfab+ <dig> with a  <dig> amino acid linker and a scfab variant with a  <dig> amino acid linker where the cysteins connecting both antibody chains were deleted . linker length was chosen to cover the space between the lc carboxyterminus and the aminoterminal end of the fd fragment, as determined from x ray crystallographic data of fab fragments. to reduce the risk of adverse effects of the linker sequence on the yield or folding, an intra-domain linker sequence from the phage protein piii was duplicated and inserted. the antibody fragments were cloned into the vector phal <dig>  <cit> . vectors and linkers are given in figure  <dig> 

production of antibody phage
for evaluation of the antibody formats in phage display, different phal1-d <dig>  phagemids were packaged using either hyperphage or m13k <dig>  as decribed, when using the helperphage m13k <dig>  observed phage yields were higher than when using hyperphage . when using m13k <dig>  the yield was between  <dig> ×  <dig> and  <dig> ×  <dig> phage per  <dig> ml culture, whereas  <dig> ×  <dig> to  <dig> ×  <dig> phage per  <dig> ml culture were produced with hyperphage. the phage productions showed only marginal differences between the antibody designs when using m13k <dig> or hyperphage.

sds-page analysis of antibody phage
d <dig>  antibody phage preparations generated with m13k <dig> or hyperphage were separated by sds-page under reducing conditions and blotted onto pvdf membranes. piii was visualised by immunostaining using a monoclonal mouse anti-piii antibody. piii has a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda, but it runs at an apparent molecular mass of  <dig> kda in sds-page  <cit> . as expected, with phage produced using m13k <dig>  the piii band at  <dig> kda dominated, especially for fab, reflecting a low amount of fusion protein obtained in monovalent display . the antibody-piii fusion was more prominent for the phage generated with hyperphage and is present in amounts almost equal to the unfused piii . the display efficiency of all scfabs variants was better than that of the fab fragments when using m13k <dig> 

antigen elisa of antibody phage
antigen binding of phage presenting the different antibody formats was determined by elisa on lysozyme.  <dig> ×  <dig> phage/well were applied when m13k <dig> was used for phage rescue, whereas  <dig> phage/well were used after packaging with hyperphage to compensate the known differences in antibody presentation efficiency of both systems  <cit> .

in the case of phage packaged using m13k <dig>  the scfv format showed best antigen binding. the fab and scfabΔc fragments bound the antigen approximately half as good as the scfv. the presentation of functional antibody fragments on the phage surface was weaker for the other scfab variants. the results for hyperphage packaged phage  were different. here, the fab and scfv fragments were presented best as functional proteins on phage, whereas the scfab variants were one third as good. however, the scfabΔc was the best variant of the scfab variants.

production of soluble antibody variants using the phage display vector phal1
in order to investigate the production of soluble d <dig>  scfab antibody fragments using phage display vectors,  <dig> μl aliquots of supernatant from an overnight expression of e. coli strain xl1-blue mrf', transformed with phal1-d <dig>  constructs in mtps, were analyzed by antigen elisas using mab anti-strep tag for detection . this assay rates the production and binding of the antibody fragments in combination. the highest signals corresponding to the best yield of functional antibody fragments were obtained with the scfv and the scfabΔc variants, indicating that these formats were produced with a high fraction of correctly folded antibody fragments. the deletion of the cysteins in the scfab led to an increased yield of functional antibody fragments. additionally, the three antibody fragments were produced in  <dig> ml scale in e. coli and purified using protein l. serial dilutions of equimolar fractions, estimated by sds-page, of scfv, fab and scfabΔc were used to compare the content of functional protein by lysozyme antigen elisa . while same amounts of scfv and scfabΔc bound the antigen almost equal, the fab fragments showed about 100× less antigen binding.

production of soluble antibody variants using the e. coli expression vector pope101-xp
production of different d <dig>  antibody fragments was also tested using the dedicated e. coli expression vector pope101-xp.  <dig> μl aliquots of the periplasmic fraction and the osmotic shock fraction were analysed by separation on a reducing 10% sds-page and immunoblot. the antibody fragments were detected using mab mouse anti-myc tag antibody. the estimated relative molecular mass of all antibody fragments corresponded with the relative molecular mass of the scfab and scfabΔc including all tags of about  <dig>  kda, respectively  <dig>  kda, the scfv with a relative molecular mass of about  <dig>  kda and the fd fragment of the fab with a relative molecular mass of about  <dig>  kda .

afterwards, the antibody fragments were purified by imac followed by protein l affinity chromatography. purified samples of scfv, fab, scfab and scfabΔc were analyzed by surface plasmon resonance  to determine the affinity of the different antibody variants. following affinities were measured: scfv:  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m; fab  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m; scfab:  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m; scfabΔc:  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m. all measured affinities were in a similiar range, indicating that the newly introduced linker does not inhibit or impair binding to the antigen.

monomers and multimers of the antibody fragments were separated by size exclusion chromatography. the gel filtration results are shown exemplarily for the scfv  and scfabΔc . the major peak corresponds to the size calculated for the scfabΔc monomers, almost the same amount represents dimers. the fab existed as monomer and the other scfabs also showed monomer, dimer and multimer fractions . the separated monomers, dimers and multimer fraction of all different antibody fragments were analysed by antigen binding elisa on lysozyme with  <dig> μm antibody fragments  and with a serial dilution of the antibody fragments . the scfv was present as a dimer, and this antibody fragment showed the best binding to lysozyme. multimers of scfab and scfabΔc also showed good antigen binding and the monomeric fab, scfab and scfabΔc fractions bound weaker to lysozyme. as expected, the multimers bound better than the dimers and the dimers bound better than the monomers to the antigen.

production of scfab in p. pastoris
the d <dig> scfabΔc was expressed in p. pastoris to investigate compatability of the scfab format with an eukaryotic expression system. antibody fragments were purified by protein l affinity chromatography and analysed by size exclusion chromatography . the scfabΔc showed a strong tendency to form dimers. the gel filtration fraction of monomeric, dimeric and presumably multimeric scfabΔc were analysed by elisa on lysozyme . as expected, due to the avidity effect, the multimers showed strongest binding followed by dimers and monomers.

discussion
so far, two antibody formats, fabs and scfvs, have dominated antibody phage display and the production of soluble antibody fragments in e. coli. in this study, to test whether it is possible to combine the advantages of both formats, various single chain fab  constructs were generated and evaluated. in scfab, the light chain and the fd fragment of a fab fragment are connected by a polypeptide linker derived from the piii of filamentous phage m <dig>  three scfab variants with different linker length from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids and one  <dig> amino acid variant with a deleted intermolecular disulphide bond  were compared to scfv and fab using the lysozyme binding antibody d <dig>   <cit>  as a model antibody. in mammalian cells, an antibody construct using a  <dig> aa gly-ser linker to combine the hc fragment and the lc has succesfully been produced to generate a single chain igg  <cit> . the scfab designs presented in this study, in contrast, were evaluated both for their compatibility with antibody phage display and production of soluble antibody fragments in microbial production systems. for the latter, in the prokaryotic expression system e. coli, both the phage display phagemid phal <dig>  <cit>  and the e. coli expression vector pope <dig>  <cit>  were tested. additionally, the production in the eukaryotic expression system using the yeast p. pastoris was demonstrated.

the applicability of the new antibody designs for antibody phage display is of major importance, as antibody phage display is currently a major technology for the generation of human antibodies for research, diagnostic and therapy  showed similiar results for all antibody variants and are in contrast to the results of the functional elisas. the scfab variants were found as monomers, dimers and multimers, the scfv was only found as dimer, and the fab occured only as monomer. the multimeric and dimeric antibody fragment fractions showed better antigen binding compared to the monomeric states, indicating the expected avidity benefit. the results obtained for e. coli could be reproduced by analysis of scfabΔc produced in pichia pastoris. this yeast expression system is of growing importance for antibody production because a glycosylation of full size antibodies identical to that in humans was achieved with glycoengineered p. pastoris lines  <cit> .

in summary, the results show that scfab variants which are fully compatible with antibody phage display and superior to fab fragments can be designed. second, the scfabs, in particular the delta cysteine variant , compensated for some of the disadvantages of soluble fab production in e. coli. however, in phage display, we see the major advantage of the scfab format in the context of an optimised procedure for the generation of large amounts of binders on a proteome wide scale  <cit> . here, a streamlined process has to be developed and optimised for significantly different parameters when compared to the current "industry standard" methods applied to the selection of therapeutic antibody candidates  <cit> . the improved display and stability of a robust fab-size fragment that is compatible to widely used detection antisera may be a significant advantage. further, the dimerisation offers an apparent affinity increase by avidity in most assays, without it being necessary to re-engineer or subclone the antibody's binding site. otherwise the occurance of different states in the scfab variants makes it difficult the calculate the affinity. furthermore, a mixture of states can not be used for clinical purposes. the association of two scfv polypeptide chains to form a noncovalent dimer  has been described frequently  <cit> . we observed a similar capability of the scfab polypeptides, resulting in a protein fraction with double the molecular mass and increased binding due to the avidity provided by two binding sites. this molecular species was shown to be formed independently from the production host and its chaperone equipment, in both the gram-negative bacterium e. coli and the yeast pichia pastoris. further, even trifabodies, tetrafabodies and larger assemblies of the same polypeptide chain seem to be formed in analogy to the triabodies and tetrabodies described for the scfv constructs   <cit> . tetrafabodies may be favoured among these multimers for topological reasons. the size exclusion chromotography data of both the e. coli and p. pastoris derived materials strongly encourage the further research and characterization of these molecular species. it should be noted that in analogy to the scfv polypeptides, the formation of bispecific difabodies containing two different sets of v regions seems easily achievable using designs homologous to those described for single chain fvs.

CONCLUSIONS
the novel antibody design scfabΔc can be used for the production of soluble antibody fragments in e. coli and pichia pastoris and is compatible with the phage display technology. in particular, it allows the use of common standard detection secondary sera, thus avoiding additional anti-tag antibody. further, reagents with high apparent affinity can be created due to the avidity effects of difabodies without any subcloning steps. this advantage is of particular value for high throughput proteome binder generation projects.
