BACKGROUND
neoplasia can be driven by a variety of mechanisms. in many cases, oncogenic mutations result in the dysregulation of transcription. this is the case in mutations resulting in β-catenin stabilization in tumors, as stabilized β-catenin activates transcription factors in the tcf/lef family. these transcription factors regulate gene expression in a tissue specific manner  <cit> . aggressive fibromatosis, also known as desmoid tumor, is a locally invasive soft tissue tumor composed of a clonal proliferation of mesenchymal, fibroblast-like, cells  <cit> . somatic mutations in either the adenomatous polypisis coli  or β-catenin genes, resulting in the stabilization of β-catenin protein, are present in the majority of lesions. this gives aggressive fibromatosis tumor cells a proliferative advantage through tcf/lef dependent transcriptional activation  <cit> . there are a variety of lines of evidences suggesting that differentially expressed genes in aggressive fibromatosis are involved in the development of this tumor. for instance, the differentially expressed genes, cox- <dig>  rhamm, mmp- <dig>  timp- <dig> and pai- <dig> modulate the size or number of aggressive fibromatosis tumor that form  <cit> .

to determine how differentially regulated genes contribute to the neoplastic phenotype in aggressive fibromatosis, suppression subtractive hybridization was used to compare gene expression differences between cell cultures derived from an aggressive fibromatosis tumor with an apc mutation and the same cells after transfection of wild-type apc. in this comparison, we found that samd <dig> was one of the most highly differentially regulated genes, and was upregulated with transfection of the wild-type apc. this study focuses on the gene structure and function of samd <dig> and its paralogous gene, samd9l.

RESULTS
samd <dig> is differentially regulated in aggressive fibromatosis
primary cell cultures from an aggressive fibromatosis tumor harbouring a truncating apc mutation were established. these were transfected with either a wild-type apc gene or a control vector, and successful transfection verified using immunohistochemistry. these cell cultures were established for a previous study to determine the role of the interaction between apc and β-catenin in the regulation of cell proliferation in aggressive fibromatosis. the transfection conditions, mutational analysis, and results of proliferation studies have been previously reported  <cit> . rna from the cells derived from an aggressive fibromatosis tumor with an apc mutation and the same cells after transfection of wild-type apc were compared using suppression subtractive hybridization. both forward  and reverse  subtractions were conducted. clones were identified, and verified using northern blot. the most differentially expressed clones were sequenced and their identity searched using genbank.

in this comparison, the most differentially regulated gene in the reverse subtraction was a novel gene that was initially identified on human chromosome  <dig> using genbank sequence data. both 5'- and 3'- rapid amplification of cdna ends  using the sequence of the  <dig> bp clone isolated from suppression subtractive hybridization, as well as analysis of est in the region were undertaken to identify the full length of this gene. subsequent to the start of this work, strausberg et al identified a gene in this region using high through put analysis of est's and designed the gene sterile alpha motif domain  <dig>   <cit> . during this analysis, we also found a nearby gene, which was also subsequently identified by strausberg et al as sterile alpha motif domain  <dig> like   <cit> . using a search of the dna sequence database in genbank, samd <dig> and samd9l were found to match human chromosome 7q <dig> . samd9l is located 5' upstream from the samd <dig> gene . both genes are coded by the reverse strand with a head to tail orientation.

structure of samd <dig> and its paralogue – samd9l
compiling all of the sequence data, we located the most 5'- end sequence for samd <dig> in a 5'- race clone, and the most 3'- end sequence for samd <dig> in one of the est clones  . using primers corresponding to the sequences of the most 5'- and 3'- ends of the samd <dig> gene, a predicted  <dig> kb transcript was amplified from an aggressive fibromatosis tumor cdna. the full-length of this transcript, the longest transcript that we found, was sequenced . the cdna sequence of samd <dig> gene has  <dig> bp with a poly-a signal  at  <dig> bp downstream from the transcriptional start point . mapping this cdna sequence to the genomic dna sequence in the genbank, the samd <dig> gene is  <dig> bp in length and contains three exons . there is a tata signal  at - <dig> bp and five predicted lef/tcf binding elements  at - <dig> bp, - <dig> bp, - <dig> bp, - <dig> bp and - <dig> bp. the clones isolated from 5'- and 3'- race of the samd <dig> gene were sequenced. comparing the 5'- and 3'- race sequences to the genomic dna sequence from genbank, different transcription initiation sites and polyadenylation sites of samd <dig> are noted, and there are at least two alternative splices.

during the analysis of est sequences near the initial clone, we identified a second gene,samd9l, which is located  <dig> bp distal to samd <dig>  using the sequences from the most 5'- and 3'- est in the region  , the full-length sequence of the samd9l was amplified from an aggressive fibromatosis tumor cdna, and sequenced . the cdna sequence of samd9l gene has  <dig> bp with a poly-a signal  at  <dig> bp downstream from the transcriptional start point . mapping this cdna sequence to the genomic dna sequence in genbank, the samd9l gene is  <dig> bp in length, including six exons . there is a tata signal  at - <dig> bp and two predicted lef/tcf binding elements  at - <dig> bp and - <dig> bp.

there are alternatively spliced transcripts in both samd <dig>  and samd9l  . these alternative splices lead to either inclusion or exclusion of an exon due to the usage of a different 5' donor splice site or a different 3' acceptor splice site. this alternative splicing also changes the internal coding region due to an in-frame insertion or deletion in both samd <dig> and samd9l. in the case of samd <dig>  non-canonical dinucleotides at and tc are used as donor and acceptor splice sites for intron  <dig>  and there is an in-frame canonical pair of the donor and acceptor  splice sites near by. this alternative splicing changes the internal coding region due to an in-frame deletion, leading to the exclusion of sequence coding for a putative protein structure domain – sterile alpha motif  domain near the n-terminus.

the putative protein structures of both genes were determined using the open reading frame finder program on the national center for biotechnology information  website  <cit> , and an open reading frame was identified in the last exon of both genes. the two genes share 78% homology at the dna sequence level in this exon. the putative protein sequences were analyzed using the conserved domain search program in ncbi website  <cit>  for samd <dig>  the motif scan program from swiss institute of bioinformatics  <cit>  and the predict protein server from european molecular biology laboratory  <cit>  websites for samd9l. both protein products contain a sterile alpha motif  domain near the n-terminal region. otherwise, there is no close homology to other well-characterized proteins or protein motifs. based on a comparison of the sam domain sequence of samd <dig> to the homology modeling of the rna-binding smg sam domain  <cit> , the sam domain of samd <dig> lacks the residues that are essential for binding rna, while it has 98% sequence homology with the ephrin-b2-receptor sam domain, which forms homo-oligomerization and provides a platform for the formation of larger protein complexes  <cit> .

samd <dig> and samd9l are ubiquitously expressed
the expected  <dig> kb transcript of samd <dig> was identified by northern analysis using rna from different age placentas and a  <dig> bp pcr amplified probe encompassing the 3'utr . the expression pattern of samd <dig> in multiple tissues was investigated using a human multiple tissue cdna panel  and rt-pcr. the primers were designed to recognize sequences at 3'utr of samd <dig>  expression was detected in all human adult, fetal and tumor tissues that were tested, except for fetal brain. only a very low signal was detected in skeletal muscle . using the sequences at 3'utr of samd9l as primers, samd9l was also found to be expressed in all tissues, except for the tumor types, colon cancer , breast cancer  and pancreatic cancer  .

samd <dig> and samd9l are expressed at lower levels in tumors
to determine the level of expression of samd <dig> in neoplasia, semi-quantitative rt-pcr and real-time quantitative pcr were performed using the sequence at 5'utr of samd <dig> as a sense primer and a sequence at the beginning of the open reading frame of samd <dig> as an anti-sense primer. expression was compared between tumor and normal control tissues in cases of aggressive fibromatosis, breast cancer and colon cancer. samd <dig> was expressed at a lower level  in aggressive fibromatosis . expression of samd <dig> was lower in 20% cases of breast cancer and 35% cases of colon cancer than in the normal control tissues . in three cases of colon cancer, there was no rt-pcr product detected. however, there was no significant difference in expression between colon cancers and normal control tissues or breast cancers and normal control tissues when analysed as a group using real-time pcr. expression studies of samd9l were also conducted using a sequence at 5'utr which is common for all of the splice variants except one, as a sense primer and sequence at the beginning of the open reading frame as an anti-sense primer. there was no statistically significant difference in samd9l expression between aggressive fibromatosis or colon cancer and normal control tissues. however, the expression of samd9l was lower in breast cancers than in healthy breast epithelial tissues from the same patients . there was no significant difference in expression of samd9l between aggressive fibromatosis samples and normal controls tissues . while two genes are expressed at a lower level in tumors, there is a discrepancy between the levels of expression of the two genes in different tumor types. for instance, samd <dig> is expressed at lower levels in aggressive fibromatosis, while samd9l is not.

samd <dig> is a cytoplasmic protein
in order to investigate the cellular localization of the putative samd <dig> protein, the open reading frame of the samd <dig> gene was cloned, an n-terminal egfp tag was added and subcloned into a cmv driven vector plp-egfp-c <dig> . this vector was transfected into cos- <dig> cells, and using an antibody to egfp, the fusion protein was detected as a  <dig> kda band . to determine its localization in a variety of cell types, it was transfected into a human fetal fibroblast cell line, mrc- <dig>  and a colon cancer cell line, sw <dig>  the egfp fusion protein was detected diffusely in the cell cytoplasm .

rnai for samd <dig> can be used to down regulate its expression
rna interference was utilized to study the cellular function of samd <dig>  rna interference was designed by searching the public available sequence database to find a  <dig> bp oligonucleotide sequence specific for samd <dig> and inserting into a psuper-rnai-egfp expression vector to generate the samd <dig> rna interference vector . one of the sequences is  <dig> bp after the start of translation, and other is  <dig> bp after the start of translation. the psuper-rnai-egfp expression vector was generated based on pegfp-c <dig>  and psuper  <cit> . a nucleotide substitution from g to a at the 9th position of this  <dig> bp oligonucleotide results in abolishing of its specificity to samd <dig> and was used as negative control after subcloned into a psuper-rnai-egfp expression vector to generate the negative control vector .

samd <dig> expression reduced by rna interference vector for samd <dig> was tested by co-transfection of an n-terminal egfp tagged samd <dig> expression vector with either one of the two samd <dig> rna interference vectors, rna interference vector with mutated samd <dig> sequence to null its function as negative control, or its control empty vector into cos- <dig> cells. the reduction of samd <dig> expression was confirmed using western blot with anti-gfp  for the fusion putative samd <dig> protein. a 90% reduction in expression of samd <dig> fusion protein by rna interference was detected as measured using densitometry . the rna interference vector that express egfp was also expressed in sw <dig> cells along with an n-terminal ha tagged samd <dig> expression vector or its control vector. a 90% reduction in expression of samd <dig> fusion protein by rna interference was detected . activity of the rna interference vector for samd <dig> was further verified by the reduction of samd <dig> rna expression in mrc- <dig> cells .

samd <dig> regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis
because β-catenin stabilization is known to regulate fibroblast proliferation, motility and invasiveness  <cit> , we studied the effect of down-regulating samd <dig> on these parameters. proliferation rate, as measured by brdu incorporation, was increased after rna interference of samd <dig> in mrc- <dig> cells . there was not a statistical difference in cell motility as measured by the number of cells passing through the membrane of the culture insert . cell invasion was increased, as measured by the number of cells passing through the membrane of the matrigel invasion chambers, after samd <dig> expression was decreased in mrc- <dig> cells by rna interference . these studies were also undertaken in cos- <dig> cells, and showed a similar reduction in proliferation rate after over-expression of the putative samd <dig> protein in cos- <dig> cells . taken together, this shows that samd <dig> plays a role regulating cell proliferation.

to explore the effect in neoplasia, cells from the sw <dig> colon cancer cell line were transfected with a samd <dig> expression vector to determine if increasing expression of this gene would suppress the neoplastic behavior in these cells. upon transfection of the construct, cell proliferation was reduced . cell invasion index calculated as the ratio of the total number of nuclei counted in the membrane for invasion assay to that in the membrane for motility assay was reduced , while cell apoptosis, as indirectly measured by relative caspase- <dig> activity was increased . the relative caspase- <dig> activity was also reduced in cos- <dig> cells after expression of the samd <dig> sirna construct . thus expressing samd <dig> at higher levels causes cell effects which would be expected to suppress the neoplastic phenotype.

samd <dig> regulates tumor growth
to investigate the role of samd <dig> in tumor growth, the colon cancer cell line, sw <dig>  was transfected with samd <dig> expression vector or its control empty vector. the stably transfected sw <dig> cells were injected into the immune deficient mice. the tumor volume of the xenograft from sw <dig> cells over-expressing samd <dig> was reduced in both nude mice  and nod-scid mice . to verify the role of samd <dig> on neoplasia, we performed experiments when the expression of samd <dig> was lowered using rna interference. the tumor volume of the xenograft from sw <dig> cells expressing the rna interference of samd <dig> was increased in nude mice .

orthologous genes of samd <dig> and samd9l
the orthologous genes were identified for samd <dig> and samd9l by searching the nr and swissprot databases for best reciprocal matches using human samd <dig> and samd9l protein sequences. genome sequences for all species available were searched by blat at the university of california at santa cruz genome browser  <cit> . the results were summarized in table  <dig> and the phylogram  was constructed using multiple sequence alignment of orthologous genes identified with clustalw program from european bioinformatics institute website  <cit> . the default parameters from website documentation were used  <cit> . based on their sequence similarity, samd <dig> and samd9l appear to have originated from a common ancestor by an ancient gene duplication. since there are orthologous genes of both samd <dig> and samd9l in chimpanzees, dogs and rats, but not in chicken, frog or fish species, this duplication event likely occurred after the mammalian radiation. the genomic structures of both samd <dig> and samd9l, including the order and orientation of genes within the genomic region and the relative size of the intergenic region, are conserved in all available mammalian genome sequences including opossum, indicating the gene duplication event occurred between  <dig> to  <dig> mya  <cit> . no evidence for either gene was found in lower eukaryotes such as drosophila, c. elegans or yeast.

samd <dig> is lost in the mouse lineage
there were several overlapping ests matching the open reading frame for samd9l, and no ests corresponding to the open reading frame for samd <dig> in the mouse genome. this was confirmed by bioinformatic searches of all genomic sequences and partial genome sequences . the  <dig> kb region in human chromosome  <dig>  in which samd <dig> is located, has no match in the mouse genome. a syntenic map of the region was constructed for human, mouse and rat. a break of synteny at the samd <dig> locus was determined in mouse, with distal genes mapping to mouse chromosome  <dig>  and the proximal genes mapping to mouse chromosome  <dig>  the mouse specific rearrangement resulted in new centromere formation at the site of breakage and the subsequent loss of the samd <dig> gene. the samd9l region contains numerous gaps in the mouse genome assembly, and an enrichment of mouse specific segmental duplications . the relatively poor draft quality of the rat genome does not allow for high resolution mapping of this locus, but there is evidence to support the existence of both samd <dig> and samd9l genes in rats with no large genomic rearrangements, segmental duplications or breaks in synteny although numerous gaps do exist . there are no gaps or segmental duplications at this locus in the human genome, determined by searching the human genome segmental duplication database.

discussion
here we identified a novel gene samd <dig> and its paralogue samd9l located in human chromosome 7q <dig> . these genes are expressed ubiquitously in human tissues. samd <dig> is expressed at a lower level in aggressive fibromatosis and some cases of breast and colon cancer, while samd9l is expressed at a lower level in breast cancer, compared to normal control tissues from the same patients. the putative protein of samd <dig> is localized in the cytoplasm. our in vitro data suggests samd <dig> regulates cell proliferation rate in both normal and tumor cell lines. over-expression of samd <dig> in sw <dig> cells reduced the volume of tumors that formed in nude mice and nod-scid mice, while the decreased expression in sw <dig> cells increased the tumor volume formed in nude mice suggesting a role suppressing the neoplastic phenotype.

very recently, it was found that samd <dig> is mutated in the inherited condition, normophosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis  <cit> . in the work of topaz et al, there is a likely inadvertent error, as when comparing the protein sequences in the publication with the swissprot/ncbi database, it was found that the mouse samd <dig> sequence reported is actually a predicted rat samd <dig> protein sequence  and the rat samd <dig> sequence reported is the rat predicted samd9l protein sequence . while conclusions in their manuscript on the species conservation of samd <dig> are incorrect, the occurrence of soft tissue lesions in this inherited condition supports our notion that samd <dig> plays an important role in cell processes that are important in neoplasia.

there are alternatively spliced transcripts in both samd <dig> and samd9l. the mechanism for alternative splice of samd <dig> is unusual in that it uses the non-canonical dinucleotides at and tc as donor and acceptor splice sites for intron  <dig>  and there is an in-frame canonical pair of the donor and acceptor  splice sites near by. although only the canonical gt-ag, and the non-canonical gc-ag and at-ac pairs can recruit the splicing machinery effectively, burset et al suggested that the other non-canonical pairs can function exclusively in association with a canonical pair, which shares its properties with the neighbour, as some kind of parasitic splice sites  <cit> . this alternative splice results in the in-frame deletion of the sequence coding for the sterile alpha motif  domain near the n-terminus of samd <dig>  although it is only detected in a quarter of the normal and tumor tissues tested, it has potential to play a dominate-negative role in the functioning of the main common samd <dig> transcript with the sam domain. the alternative splicing increases the functional complexity of this novel gene, but the function significance of these alternative splicing variants needs further investigation.

while we did not investigate the regulation of expression in samd <dig> and samd9l, there are lef/tcf binding elements predicted in the genomic sequence upstream of the transcriptional start point for both genes. we also found that the expression of these genes is disregulated in neoplasms driven by β-catenin mediated signaling. although this suggests samd <dig> may be regulated by β-catenin, formal promoter studies are needed to verify this possibility.

there is an n-terminal sterile alpha motif  domain in the predicted putative proteins of samd <dig> and samd9l. the sam domain sequence of samd <dig> was compared using the homology modeling of the rna-binding smg sam domain  <cit> . this showed that the sam domain lacks the residues that are essential for binding rna, while it has 98% sequence homology with the ephrin-b2-receptor sam domain, which is important in homo-oligomerization and acts as a platform for the formation of larger protein complexes  <cit> . this raises the possible that samd <dig> may have a similar function participating in protein complexes.

human chromosome 7q <dig>  is located at an evolutionary breakpoint between mouse chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  which was localized after human-mouse comparative mapping of the genomic region containing cdk <dig>  i.e., human genes' centromeric to cdk <dig> map to proximal mouse chromosome  <dig>  while those telomeric to the open reading frame for samd9l, map to proximal mouse chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . based on our bioinformatics analysis, there are chimpanzee, dog, and rat orthologous genes for both samd <dig> and samd9l. although there is a mouse ortholog of samd9l, samd <dig> is lost in the mouse genome. this is the first report as far as we know about a human gene that exists in rat, but is lost in mouse.

four human genes, collagen xxi , serine-threonine kinase family member , g-protein coupled receptor family member  and ras homologue gene family member i , located in regions corresponding to evolutionary breakpoints in rodents are absent in both mouse and rat genomes due to an unexpected consequence of evolutionary chromosome rearrangement at the evolutionary breakpoint and lost during evolution  <cit> . samd <dig> locates in a  <dig> kb region on human chromosome  <dig>  which has no match in the mouse genome, and at the break in synteny in the mouse genome. but there is no break in synteny at this locus in the rat genome. mouse-human breakpoint absent in the human-rat comparison suggests the rearrangement is specific to the mouse lineage, i.e. mouse-specific breakpoint. there are no segmental duplications at this locus in human and rat genomes after search of human and rat segmental duplication databases. fluorescent in situ hybridization  using a bac containing mouse est for samd9l  revealed a single strong signal at 6a1-a <dig> in mouse chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . since the sequence of estm <dig> maps to the open reading frame of mouse samd9l, and it has very high homology with the sequence at the open reading frame of human samd <dig>  the fish result indicates samd <dig> does not exist in mouse.

here we propose a model, which is mouse specific, for the genomic rearrangement, break in synteny, centromere formation and deletion of samd <dig> although it is very difficult to properly estimate all those events. we highlight a mouse specific rearrangement, resulting in the loss of the samd <dig> gene. segmental duplications have been shown to mediate chromosomal rearrangements via non-allelic homologous recombination  <cit> , and it has been shown that there is a significant correlation between low copy repeats and break of synteny between human and mouse  <cit> . taken together, the existence of the mouse specific rearrangement and mouse specific low copy repeats, it would suggest a causative role, but no direct conclusions can be made. it has also been shown that centromeric regions act as reservoirs for recently duplicated sequence and this may account for the enrichment of low copy repeats at this locus  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  in the mouse genome, two segmental duplications, one centromeric to cdk <dig> and the other centromeric to samd9l, may mediate chromosomal breakage with subsequent deletion of samd <dig>  and the centromeres of mouse chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> are formed at the sites of breakage. there is no evidence of the segmental duplications at this locus in the rat genome after searching the evan eichler's rat segmental duplication database  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
samd <dig> and samd9l are expressed ubiquitously in human tissues, but they are expression at lower levels in neoplasia. samd <dig> regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis, and decreases tumor growth of colon cancer cell line in immune deficient mice. this is the first report as far as we know about a human gene that exists in rat, but is lost in mouse, due to a mouse specific rearrangement, resulting in the loss of the samd <dig> gene. although these novel genes were identify in the study of a relatively rare disorder, aggressive fibromatosis, these genes seem to play a role regulating cell growth in a variety of tumor types.
