BACKGROUND
endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in the united states, with an estimated  <dig>  new cases and  <dig>  deaths annually  <cit> . most cases of endometrial cancer are endometrioid adenocarcinoma , are of low grade, and are diagnosed at an early stage, with a 5-year survival rate of greater than 85%  <cit> . uterine papillary serous carcinoma , an aggressive histologic subtype of endometrial cancer, represents less than 10% of all endometrial cancers. however, upsc accounts for more than 50% of recurrences and deaths attributed to endometrial carcinoma  <cit> . eac commonly displays near-diploid karyotypes, microsatellite instability, and mutations in the pten, kras, and ctnnb <dig>  genes. upsc is characterized by frequent tp <dig> mutation, her-2/neu overexpression, and an aneuploid karyotype  <cit> .

like many malignancies, endometrial cancer is a complex disease driven by both genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors. dna methylation has long been implicated in the development and progression of tumors in various tissue types . an overall reduction in total 5-methylcytosine level and focal hypermethylation in cpg islands near tumor-suppressor gene transcriptional start sites were found in many different types of cancers . among endometrial cancers, promoters of important tumor suppressor genes including mlh <dig>  rassf1a, pten, and apc, were found to be hypermethylated in eac. however, methylation status of these genes was largely unaltered in upsc . the divergent hypermethylation between these tumor types might be caused by the significantly increased expression of dna methyltransferases dnmt <dig> and dnmt3b observed in eac, whereas expressions of these enzymes were unchanged or even decreased in upsc  <cit> .

recently, the cancer genome atlas consortium  profiled dna methylation of more than  <dig> endometrial cancer samples using array-based dna methylation platforms , which interrogate  <dig>  cpg sites and  <dig>  cpg sites respectively  <cit> . here we took a complementary approach to identify dna methylation changes unique to the two endometrial cancer subtypes in an unbiased fashion. our strategy allowed us to systematically measure dna methylation levels of more than  <dig> million cpg sites in the cancer genome in an unbiased fashion with respect to intergenic and intronic regions, including repetitive regions derived from transposable elements. these regions are classically not measured by array-based methods, such as the ones employed by tcga  <cit> .

we generated complete dna methylome maps for endometrioid adenocarcinoma , uterine papillary serous carcinoma , and normal endometrium  by integrating data from methylated dna immunoprecipitation sequencing  and methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme sequencing  . comparative analysis of these seven dna methylomes identified cancer-associated differentially methylated regions  and distinct eac and upsc genomic dna methylation patterns. many methylation changes were found in cpg island shores and these changes were predicted to affect expression of nearby genes. we found demethylation across large domains on the x chromosome in upsc accompanied by decreased xist expression. we also identified methylation differences at numerous mirna gene promoters that correlated with expression changes of the associated mirnas. we discovered that cancer type-specific dmrs were enriched for not only promoters, but also for enhancer elements. moreover, specific transposable elements , a rich genomic resource for potential enhancers , were affected by both de novo methylation and demethylation in cancer samples. together, these results suggest that dna methylation broadly impacts cancer gene expression via regulation of promoters as well as enhancers and tes.

RESULTS
distinct global and focal dna methylation signatures in two types of endometrial cancer
dna methylation changes have been reported in many types of cancers and exhibit strong tissue-specific and tumor type-specific characteristics  <cit> . dna methylation changes in the two subtypes of endometrial cancers, endometrioid adenocarcinoma  and uterine papillary serous carcinoma , were recently reported by the cancer genome atlas consortium  <cit> . this seminal study provided the first insight into dna methylation changes at a genome-wide scale for this important cancer using array-based platforms. here we took a different strategy, which is complementary to that of tcga, to deeply profile complete dna methylomes of a small number of tumor specimens using newly developed sequencing-based epigenomics technology  <cit> . this strategy allowed us to systematically discover dna methylation changes in cancer genomes without the biases imposed by microarray methods. findings based on analyzing a small number of deeply profiled dna methylomes  can then be validated using array-based approaches, which can be applied to a much bigger number of samples . in this study, we generated complete dna methylomes from six tumor samples  and  <dig> pooled normal endometrium sample by applying methylated dna immunoprecipitation sequencing  and methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme sequencing   <cit> . we were able to comprehensively measure dna methylation levels of more than  <dig> million cpgs for each sample . sequencing data from the tumor samples were normalized by their genomic copy number variations identified using the affymetrix snp <dig>  array.

previous tumor dna methylome studies have shown global demethylation accompanied by focal hypermethylation in many cancers . to understand the global pattern of dna methylation alterations in endometrial cancer, we directly compared the overall distribution of signal density from medip-seq data at 5 kb resolution across the seven methylomes. as expected, cancer samples showed both hypomethylated and hypermethylated changes compared to normal endometrium . on average,  <dig> % of the genome became hypomethylated, and  <dig> % became hypermethylated in cancer . eac and upsc did not exhibit dramatic differences in this analysis.

our main goal was to identify local differentially methylated regions  between cancer and normal endometrium in a genome-wide fashion. to this end, we developed and applied m&m, a novel algorithm that detects dmrs by integrating medip-seq and mre-seq data  <cit> . in total, we identified  <dig>  eac-associated dmrs and  <dig>  upsc-associated dmrs, with  <dig>  dmrs in common between the two types of endometrial cancer  . a complete list of these dmrs and links to the washu epigenome browser were provided on the accompanying website . in eac, 68% of dmrs  were hypermethylated and 32%  were hypomethylated relative to normal endometrium. in contrast, 40%  of the upsc-associated dmrs were hypermethylated and 60%  were hypomethylated . eac and upsc shared  <dig>  hypermethylated and  <dig>  hypomethylated dmrs . previous studies have reported that two dna methyltransferases  were more highly expressed in eac but repressed in upsc  <cit> . upregulation of the dnmts was confirmed by qrt-pcr in the three eac samples we assayed. however, in the upsc samples, dnmt <dig>  dnmt3a and dnmt3b were not repressed, but had variable expression across samples . consistent with our result, mrna-seq data from tcga also did not support previous studies: the three dna methyltransfrases exhibited significantly higher expression in patients with upsc as compared with non-tumor tissue .figure  <dig>

the genomic distribution of cancer-associated dmrs was highly non-random . over 70% of hypermethylated dmrs and 35% of hypomethylated dmrs were located in open chromatin regions and transcription factor binding sites, as defined by encode  <cit>  . hypermethylated dmrs were strongly enriched for gene-related features, including cpg islands, promoters, and exons . this is consistent with the notion that transcription-related regions, in particular cpg islands, are frequent targets of dna methylation changes in cancer. however, these dmrs  only accounted for 40% of the total hypermethylated dmrs in eacs. 60% of hypermethylated dmrs and 88% of hypomethylated dmrs were located in introns and intergenic regions . strikingly, when we examined the relationship between these dmrs and annotated enhancers, we found that both hypermethylated and hypomethylated dmrs were strongly enriched for enhancer elements . this suggests that in addition to promoters and cpg islands, enhancer elements can be a preferential target of dna methylation alteration in cancers.

next, we validated that the endometrial cancer-associated dmrs were recurrent by using infinium 450k data produced by the cancer genome atlas . the infinium 450k platform contains probes that span  <dig>  cpg sites in 40% of  <dig>  ec-shared dmrs . on average, over 85% ec-shared dmrs exhibited significant dna methylation differences  between cancer patients and normal controls . patients of all pathologic groups displayed consistent dna methylation levels within these regions, robustly confirming our initial findings . importantly, these recurrent ec-shared dmrs exhibited hypo- or hypermethylation in low-grade eac patients to the same degree as that of high-grade patients , suggesting that abnormal dna methylation is shared across tumors of different grades, and can potentially be detected in early stage of endometrial carcinogenesis. thus, these ec-shared, recurrent dna methylation changes could represent a unique epigenetic signature for endometrial cancers.

in addition, we defined cancer type-preferred dmrs .  <dig>  eac tpdmrs were present in all three eac samples but not in any upsc sample, and another  <dig> upsc tpdmrs were present in all three upsc samples but not in any eac sample. of these, 57% of eac tpdmr regions and 21% of upsc tpdmr regions contained infinium 450k cpg probes , which allowed validation of our discovery using tcga data. among these regions, 86% of eac tpdmrs and 89% upsc tpdmrs showed significant dna methylation differences  between cancer patents and normal controls . additionally, eac and upsc tpdmrs were enriched in proximity to genes with different gene ontology terms . among tcga patient samples, tpdmrs were confirmed and found to exhibit cancer type-specific hypo- or hypermethylation status, suggesting that these cancer type-preferred dmrs are recurrent with respect to each cancer type .

distinct dna methylation patterns at cpg islands, shores, and gene promoters
there are about  <dig>  cpg islands  in the human genome. about 70% of gene promoters are associated with cgis, and ~50% of cgis contain annotated transcription start sites . the majority of promoter cgis are unmethylated in somatic cells, although a significant portion of gene body cgis exhibit a conserved, tissue-specific dna methylation pattern  <cit> . dna methylation of cpg islands is often correlated with the repression of the associated genes  <cit> . cpg islands frequently gain methylation in cancer  <cit> . hypermethylation of cgis, especially those associated with tumor suppressor genes, is considered a hallmark of many types of cancers  <cit> .

examination of cgi dna methylation changes in the two types of endometrial cancers revealed distinct signatures for eac and upsc. compared to normal endometrium, we defined  <dig>  and  <dig> hypermethylated cgis for eac and upsc respectively .  <dig> cgis were hypermethylated in both types of endometrial cancer.  <dig> cgis in eac and  <dig> cgis in upsc exhibited reduced dna methylation compared to normal endometrial cells. the two types of endometrial cancer can be clearly distinguished based on their cgi dna methylation pattern .figure  <dig>

compared to promoter cgis, non-promoter cgis were more likely to undergo dna methylation changes in endometrial cancers .  <dig> cgis  and  <dig> cgis  out of ~ <dig>  intergenic cgis, and  <dig> cgis  and  <dig> cgis  out of ~ <dig>  gene body cgis, were hypermethylated. in contrast, of the ~ <dig>  promoter cgis, only  <dig> and  <dig> were hypermethylated in eac and upsc respectively. hypomethylated cgis were also predominantly located in non-promoter regions, with  <dig>  and  <dig>  in intergenic regions, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  in gene bodies. only  <dig> and  <dig> promoter cgis were hypomethylated in eac and upsc respectively.table  <dig>

next, we examined dna methylation alterations in cpg island shores . abnormal dna methylation of cgi shores was first reported in colon cancer and found to affect expression of the nearby genes  <cit> . in endometrial cancer, cgi shores exhibited dynamic dna methylation changes that were independent of changes in the cpg islands . we further classified dna methylation changes with respect to their patterns in both cgis and corresponding shores. in eac,  <dig> of  <dig>  hypermethylated cgis also displayed hypermethylation in their shore regions, while  <dig> of  <dig> upsc hypermethylated cgis had accompanying hypermethylated shores. strikingly,  <dig>  eac cgis and  <dig> upsc cgis without significant dna methylation changes had flanking hypermethylated shores. additionally,  <dig> cgis in eac and  <dig> cgis in upsc were specifically hypomethylated in their shore regions but not in cgis themselves . in eac,  <dig> genes, including lncrna genes, were found around these  <dig>  cgi shore-only hypermethylated cgis, and  <dig> genes were close to  <dig> shore-only hypomethylated cgis.

we then examined the dna methylation status of 1 kb core promoters around the tss of annotated refseq genes .  <dig> and  <dig> genes were hypermethylated or hypomethylated, respectively, at their core promoters in eac. these numbers were  <dig> and  <dig> in upsc. this result highlights the difference between the two types of endometrial cancers.  <dig> gene promoters were hypermethylated in both tumor types, while  <dig> gene promoters were hypomethylated in both. gene function enrichment analysis of these promoters returned no significantly enriched terms related to endometrial tissue function .

we observed  <dig> tumor suppressor genes   <cit>  with hypermethylated promoters in eac, which is consistent with our expectation that the silencing of tumor suppressor genes is an important component of carcinogenesis. in contrast, in upsc we found only  <dig> tumor suppressor genes with hypermethylated promoters . as expected, the majority of these tumor suppressor genes were repressed in eac . surprisingly, some of these tumor suppressor genes were also repressed in upsc, even though the promoter regions were unmethylated as in normal endometrium. for example, a well-known marker, the promoter of the mlh <dig> gene, is usually highly methylated in microsatellite instability-high  eac, and was unmethylated in upsc . however, rna-seq data from tcga suggested that expression of mlh <dig> was also repressed in some upsc patients . as expected, hypermethylation of tumor suppressor gene promoters was strongly associated with gene repression. for example, klf <dig> had a hypermethylated cgi shore and gene body and was repressed in three groups of endometrial cancer patients . similarly, the promoter of aldh1a <dig> was hypermethylated and expression of this gene was repressed in both eac and upsc. in contrast, the promoter of pcdh <dig> was specifically methylated in eac, and this gene was respressed in eac only . unexpectedly, we found the core promoter regions of two tumor suppressor genes, cdh <dig> and sfn, were demethylated in three eac samples . interestingly, these two genes were significantly upregulated in all three groups of endometrial cancer patients from tcga . cdh <dig> and sfn are important tumor suppressor genes whose loss of function has been implicated in many types of cancers . thus, their demethylation and increased expression underscores the complexity of regulatory events in endometrial cancer.

loss of x chromosome dna methylation and xistexpression in upsc
one prominent signature distinguishing eac and upsc was dna methylation differences on the x chromosome. more than 95% of dmrs on chromosome x were hypomethylated in upsc . in contrast, only ~16% of chromosome x dmrs were hypomethylated in eac. plotting medip-seq signal and mre-seq signal at a large scale  revealed loss of dna methylation across the whole x chromosome in upsc, as evidenced by reduced medip-seq signal  and increased mre-seq signal  . eac also exhibited loss of dna methylation across the x chromosome, but to a much lesser degree than upsc. in contrast, similar analysis of any autosome  revealed no global change of dna methylation in either eac or upsc . we further examined expression of xist, the lncrna critical for establishing inactivation of the x chromosome, both in published data and by performing qrt-pcr on our samples. xist showed reduced expression in both eac and upsc. interestingly, in microsatellite stable  type eac samples, the expression level of xist was inversely correlated with the tumor grade  . qrt-pcr also confirmed that xist was down-regulated in four of six endometrial cancer samples in our study . finally, we examined the methylation level of  <dig>  cpgs  in tcga endometrial cancer samples profiled on the infinium 450k platform . as expected, compared to normal controls , the patients with grade  <dig> upsc cancer type showed significantly lower dna methylation level , and the patients with grade  <dig> msi-h eac cancer type did not show difference on these cpg sites . interestingly, the tcga samples with grade  <dig> mss eac cancer type also show lightly reduced dna methylation level on the x chromosome . these results suggest that global hypomethylation of x chromosome and repressed xist expression constitute a strong signature for upsc cancers.figure  <dig>

dna methylation changes of non-coding rna genes
our genome-wide dna methylome maps also allowed us to comprehensively assess dna methylation changes around non-coding rna genes, including mirna and lncrna. epigenetic changes in promoters of non-coding rna genes could result in changes of their expression levels, which subsequently could result in expression changes of downstream protein coding genes in endometrial cancer  <cit>  and in changes of the epigenetic landscape  <cit> .

we examined dna methylation patterns in promoter regions around the tss of mirna gene clusters  <cit> . in eac, promoters of  <dig> mirna gene clusters exhibited increased dna methylation, while  <dig> mirna gene clusters exhibited reduced dna methylation. these two numbers in upsc were  <dig> and  <dig> . some of these mirnas were reported to have significant expression changes in endometrial cancer . by examining tcga mirna-seq data, we found that expression levels of certain mirnas correlated with dna methylation changes in their promoters . the microrna cluster mir200b-mir200a-mir <dig> and cluster mir200c-mir <dig> showed significant demethylation in endometrial cancer, and the expression levels of these five micrornas were significantly increased in three groups of endometrial cancer patients . the mir <dig> family was considered a tumor suppressor because of their inhibitory role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition  in bladder cancer and breast cancer cell lines . moreover, high expression of this cluster was tightly correlated with survival rate in those tumor types, and overexpression of these mirnas inhibited ovarian cancer cell motility  <cit> . in addition, the mir <dig> family was reported to show significant upregulation in endometrial carcinomas  <cit> . the exact functions of mir <dig> family members in gynecologic cancers, especially in endometrial carcinogenesis, still need to be determined. interestingly, even with strongly hypermethylated promoters, some mirnas exhibited upregulated expression level, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir99b, mir <dig>  mir106b, and mir <dig> . the regulatory relationship between promoter hypermethylation and microrna expression is likely complex and needs further investigation.

hundreds of lncrna genes  <cit>  also underwent dna methylation changes in our endometrial samples . specifically,  <dig> and  <dig> lncrna genes had hypermethylated promoters in eac and upsc respectively, compared to normal endometrium. of these,  <dig> were in common between the two cancer types. the numbers of hypomethylated lncrna genes were  <dig> for eac and  <dig> for upsc, with  <dig> in common. with the exception of classic examples such as xist, h <dig>  and hotair, the widespread regulatory roles of lncrnas are only recently being revealed  <cit> . the roles of lncrnas and consequences of their abnormal dna methylation in endometrial carcinogenesis remain to be elucidated. however, interesting candidate genes emerged from our analysis. for example, maternally expressed gene  <dig> , a tumor suppressor non-coding rna  <cit> , was highly methylated at its promoter region in eac. this was associated with significantly downregulated meg <dig> mrna . re-expression of meg <dig> was found to induce tp <dig> activation, and inhibited tumor cell proliferation in culture and colony formation in soft agar .

dna methylation changes were enriched in functional promoter and enhancer elements
the majority of the differentially methylated regions were located in intergenic or intragenic regions, while a small fraction  overlapped directly with annotated gene promoters. previous work reported that normal tissue developmental processes could be used to model tumor developmental states  <cit> . here we examined endometrial cancer dmrs in the context of their epigenetic status in embryonic stem cell  h <dig> to map the dynamics of dna methylation changes  <cit> . we defined four dna methylation patterns across esc, normal endometrium, and endometrial cancer : mmu, methylated in es cells, methylated in normal endometrium, but unmethylated  in cancer; mum, methylated in es cells, unmethylated in normal endometrium, and methylated in cancer; umu, unmethylated in es cells, methylated in normal endometrium, and unmethylated in cancer; and uum, unmethylated in es cells, unmethylated in normal endometrium, and methylated in cancer. we reasoned that the genomic distribution and functions of genes associated with different patterns might help to reveal insights into endometrial carcinogenesis in the context of normal development. we annotated the potential regulatory function of these different categories of dmrs with the chromatin state maps defined by chromhmm using nine cell lines  <cit> . interestingly, the majority of the uum dmrs were annotated as promoters, whereas the majority of the mum dmrs were annotated as enhancers .figure  <dig>

we then examined the functional enrichment of genes near these four different categories of dmrs . significantly, genes near pattern mum enhancer dmrs in both types of cancer were strongly enriched for terms related to uterine development and disease. consistent with our previous annotation of tissue-specific enhancers  <cit> , this result suggested that these dmrs might encode uterine-specific regulatory elements that became unmethylated and activated during normal development and differentiation. their hypermethylation in endometrial cancer might contribute to the loss of endometrial tissue type identity and to the gain of stem cell-like characteristics often observed in cancers. in contrast, pattern mmu dmrs enriched for functions specific to tissues unrelated to endometrium. for example, in eac, genes related to hindbrain morphogenesis and mammary gland epithelium development were enriched near mmu dmrs. in upsc, we found enrichment of genes related to lung, muscle, and kidney development. in addition, we found genes related to estrogen response, consistent with the strong connection between eac and estrogen  <cit> . this data suggested a very different but complementary mechanism for cancer gene deregulation: these mmu dmrs might represent a broad array of tissue- or cell type-specific regulatory sites important for development and differentiation. their demethylation in endometrial cancer might simultaneously deregulate tissue-specific genes important for other tissues, thereby contributing to the loss of endometrium specificity. the uum pattern, on the other hand, was associated with functions related to carcinogenesis in general, including rna polymerase ii, nucleic acid-binding transcription factors, tumor suppressor genes, direct effectors of tp <dig>  cell-substrate adherent factors, and agents of cellular response to cytokine stimuli . finally, very few dmrs exhibited the umu pattern, which was predicted to be associated with embryonic development .

we highlighted a few examples with different methylation patterns . a dmr with pattern mmu overlapped a copy of transposable element mer52a. this dmr was predicted to be an enhancer by chromhmm  <cit>  and was located in the intron of tiam <dig> and  <dig>  kb upstream of a gene-body alternative promoter. the dmr was highly methylated in esc and normal endometrium, but was hypomethylated in endometrial cancer, particularly in upsc. this element was also hypomethylated in breast myoepithelial cells but methylated in blood cells and brain tissues, consistent with the hypothesis that mmu pattern was associated with tissue-specific enhancers . tiam <dig> regulates focal adhesion, and knockdown of this gene leads to a reduced rate of cell migration  <cit> . by examining tcga mrna-seq data, we found that the expression level of tiam <dig> was upregulated in both eac and upsc, compared to normal controls . importantly, we did not find dna methylation changes at the promoter region of tiam <dig>  based on a luciferase reporter assay, this mer52a element increased reporter gene expression about 9-fold in hek-293t cells . these results suggested that demethylation of this transposable element could activate its enhancer function and increase tiam <dig> expression, potentially contributing to cancer cell migration and endometrial carcinogenesis. in another example, a pattern uum dmr was identified in the promoter region of lncrna loc <dig>  the dna methylation status of this promoter was tissue-specific: methylated in breast myoepithelial cells and brain tissue, but unmethylated in h <dig> esc, normal endometrium cells, and peripheral blood monocytes . numerous promoter dmrs with pattern mum were predicted to play roles in normal endometrial functions. for example, the adcy <dig> promoter was specifically hypomethylated in normal endometrium, but its associated cpg island shore was highly methylated in eac and upsc. adcy <dig> encodes adenylyl cyclase  <dig>  which catalyzes the formation of the secondary messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate . camp stimulates vascular endothelial growth factor  secretion by human endometrial stromal cells  <cit>  and mediates progesterone-dependent decidualization of the human endometrium  <cit> . adcy <dig> expression was indeed repressed in both eac and upsc .

bidirectional dna methylation alteration on te-derived enhancers
we noted that the tiam <dig> intragenic enhancer was within a transposable element. tes make up nearly half of the human genome, but they have long been considered “junk dna” that does not systematically contribute to normal cellular function  <cit> . deregulation of tes has, however, been proposed to be an important contributor to carcinogenesis. tes, especially line- <dig> retrotransposons, are hypomethylated in many types of cancers . we systematically evaluated the dna methylation state of all tes in the human genome that could be uniquely mapped by our sequencing technology. surprisingly, more than 30% of hypermethylated dmrs and more than 40% of hypomethylated dmrs in both types of endometrial cancer were within tes . these changes in methylation status were enriched for specific te families and subfamilies. for example, the line- <dig> family was hypomethylated in both eac and upsc , consistent with observations made in other cancer types . we calculated enrichment of te subfamilies in endometrial cancer dmrs. four subfamilies were significantly more likely to be hypermethylated in eac or upsc , whereas  <dig> subfamilies were significantly more likely to be hypomethylated in eac or upsc  .figure  <dig>

we further investigated individual te copies that exhibited a change in dna methylation. for the purpose of illustration, we used ltr6a and mer52a. we computed methylation levels of individual copies of ltr6a and mer52a in eac and upsc . about 70% of ltr6a elements exhibited increased medip-seq and decreased mre-seq signal, reflecting hypermethylation . in contrast, around 70% of mer52a elements had decreased medip-seq and increased mre-seq . the most highly hypermethylated ltr6a copies were found to be differentially methylated across different tissues, and were annotated as enhancers by chromhmm . in contrast, the most highly hypomethylated mer52a copies exhibited strong methylation in all five normal tissues  .

our results indicate that tes may be important regulatory elements, particularly enhancers, in carcinogenesis. transposable elements have been shown to wire gene regulatory networks during evolution , and te subfamilies with tissue-specific hypomethylation also function as enhancers, which may associate with tissue identity  <cit> . how these transposable elements contribute to endometrial carcinogenesis remains to be elucidated. moreover, in contrast to the common belief that most tes are methylated and repressed in somatic cells  <cit> , the discovery that a significant fraction of tes were unmethylated in normal tissues but methylated in cancer suggests that some tes play important roles in maintaining normal cell states and sustaining regular cellular physiological processes. these te-mediated processes were likely disrupted in cancer cells. the widespread abnormal dna methylation of transposable elements in cancer could reflect rewiring of gene regulatory networks during carcinogenesis. in normal tissues, some tes were unmethylated and acted as tissue-specific enhancers. when these tes were hypermethylated in cancer cells, they were silenced and this could have contributed to the down-regulation or silencing of target genes. on the other hand, hypomethylation of normally methylated tes could function as cryptic enhancers or promoters  <cit> , contributing to the upregulation of target oncogenes.

changes in dna methylation have been shown to play roles in carcinogenesis and cancer progression in many malignancies  <cit>  including endometrial cancer  <cit> . previous studies have identified many genes exhibiting abnormal dna methylation changes in endometrial cancer ; however, these studies, including the most recent and comprehensive mapping of dna methylation in endometrial cancers by tcga  <cit> , were all focused on selected genomic regions  and cpg sites. our study systematically investigated the complete dna methylome in two clinically distinct types of endometrial cancer, eac and upsc, as well as normal endometrium, providing the first whole-genome dna methylation map for this important disease. we observed significant dna methylation changes in both types of endometrial cancer, which displayed both shared and cancer subtype-preferred dna methylation signatures. endometrial cancer-shared dmrs defined a specific signature of endometrial cancer that is confirmed by tcga endometrial cancer methylation data . in upsc, which previously was thought to have infrequent dna methylation changes and low dnmt expression, we identified numerous novel dna methylation alterations  in non-promoter regions . these results demonstrate the importance of applying sequencing-based, whole-genome approaches  to comprehensively map dna methylation changes in cancers. in contrast, the infinium humanmethylation <dig> beadchip, a popular genome-wide platform used by tcga and many others, only interrogates about  <dig> %  of the  <dig> million cpgs in the human genome. in our study, more than 40% of the hypermethylated dmrs and 75% of the hypomethylated dmrs we identified were not covered by any infinium probes; additionally only about 25% of the hypermethylated dmrs and 9% of the hypomethylated dmrs had more than two probes .

despite being much more comprehensive, sequencing-based dna methylome technologies are still cost inhibitory for directly profiling the large cohort of specimens that is often required to obtain power to detect most epigenetic events significantly associated with cancer. thus, we advocate a strategy that combines deep profiling of a small number of samples  followed by validation in a large cohort . the strong validation results  suggest that our strategy is able to capture recurrent abnormal dna methylation and provide a much more complete picture of the epigenetic landscape in endometrial cancer.figure  <dig> 
infinium 450k array probe representation for dmrs. for eac dmrs, 41% of hypermethylated and 76% of hypomethylated regions were not represented by infinium 450k probes . for the upsc dmrs, 49% of hypermethylated and 75% of hypomethylated regions did not contain infinium 450k probes .



cpg islands and gene promoters are classic targets of dna methylation changes in carcinogenesis. in endometrial cancer, we confirmed that hypermethylation was strongly enriched in transcription-related regions, including cgis and promoters. over 65% of cgis with altered methylation were located in intergenic and intragenic regions, suggesting that alternative promoters may be frequent targets of dna methylation change in cancers  <cit> . in addition, cgi shores were frequently affected by dna methylation alterations   <cit> . similar to cgis, epigenetic changes at these potential regulatory regions may also regulate expression of nearby genes . epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes  is an important mechanism of carcinogenesis. in our study, many tsgs had hypermethylation in their core promoter regions, but interestingly, two tumor suppressor genes  were found to have hypomethylated promoters and increased mrna expression. hypomethylation of the snf promoter was also reported in lung and prostate cancer  <cit> . however, the methylation pattern of cdh <dig> seems to be much more complex in endometrial cancer. hypermethylated cdh <dig> promoter and repressed cdh <dig> expression were reported in some endometrial cancer cases  <cit> . our approach revealed a hypomethylated dmr located in the 5’ shore region of the cdh <dig> promoter cpg island. this discovery was confirmed by tcga infinium 450k data: significant demethylation was detected by  <dig> cpg probes located in the dmr, but  <dig> nearby cpg probes within the cpg island did not detect any dna methylation change . these results suggest that a demethylated promoter and increased expression of cdh <dig> might be a common feature of endometrioid adenocarcinomas. the role of chd <dig> in endometrial cancer remains to be determined.

during human embryonic development, one copy of the x chromosome is randomly inactivated in female cells. the x-inactivation process is initiated by the expression of xist, a mono-allelically expressed long non-coding rna. high allelic expression of xist on the inactive x establishes the inactivation state . dna methylation and repressive histone modifications, such as h3k27me <dig> and h3k9me <dig>  play essential roles in maintaining the inactivated state . the link between x chromosome epigenetic changes and female reproductive cancers was evident in a subset of breast and ovarian cancers  <cit> . in upsc, we observed significant demethylation across the entire x chromosome, accompanied by down-regulated xist expression. interestingly, the expression level of xist was also decreased in eac and correlated with tumor grade . in contrast to upsc, we did not observe a significant global hypomethylation pattern in our three eac samples. tcga data revealed no global changes in the msi-h type eac, but a small but significant global hypomethylaton in the mss type of eac and in upsc . the infinium 450k array only interrogates ~ <dig> % cpg sites on the x chromosome and is biased towards cpg sites in promoters and cpg islands. thus, further validation is necessary to confirm the status of x chromosome dna methylation. however, our results suggest that this significant sex chromosome demethylation could be a distinguishing signature between eac and upsc and might be associated with microsatellite stability. in ovarian cancer, a strong association was found between down regulated xist expression and decreased time to recurrence in patients treated with taxol  <cit> . although the mechanisms underlying xist down-regulation and the biological significance of dna methylation loss remain to be determined, we hypothesize that repressed xist expression and dna demethylation might contribute to the aggressive behavior in endometrial cancer, especially in upsc.

up to 80% of the human genome is transcribed but only ~2% encodes proteins . in the past decade, numerous small and long non-coding rnas  have been shown to be important regulators in both normal development and disease  <cit> . we observed dna methylation alterations at many mirna promoters. the expression of some mirnas was correlated with dna methylation states. for example, the mir200a-mir200b-mir <dig> cluster, which are tumor suppressor genes in many cancers, showed strong promoter demethylation in eac and upsc, with significantly upregulated expression . we also observed dna methylation alterations at promoters of hundreds of lncrna genes. the precise biological function of these mirnas and lncrnas and the significance of their dna methylation changes in endometrial cancers remain to be determined. however, their identification underscores the importance of having a comprehensive catalog of cancer-associated dna methylation changes across the whole genome.

dna methylation exhibits strong tissue specificity, which is tightly programmed during embryonic development . alteration of dna methylation in cancer radically changes the normal epigenetic landscape and results in loss of tissue specificity or cell identity  <cit> . for example, colorectal cancer dmrs had a striking overlap with tissue-specific dmrs located in cgi shore regions, possibly disrupting tissue-specific regulatory programs  <cit> . by including dna methylome data from embryonic stem cells, we identified a subset of endometrial cancer dmrs showing specific demethylation in normal endometrium, but high methylation in both h <dig> esc and endometrial cancer . these dmrs, which accounted for 30% of eac dmrs and 20% of upsc dmrs, showed a strong functional enrichment for genes related to uterine embryonic development and disease. moreover, more than half of these mum dmrs and ~25% of mmu and uum dmrs were predicted to be distal enhancers  that were deregulated in endometrial cancers. these results highlight that in addition to gene promoters, enhancers are a major target of dna methylation changes in endometrial cancer.

interestingly, a significant fraction of deregulated enhancers were derived from transposable elements : more than 30% of hypermethylated and 40% of hypomethylated dmrs harbored tes. tes have classically been understood to have high methylation in normal somatic cells and undergo global demethylation in cancers . however, recent data have demonstrated that tes play many important roles in normal biology, especially in wiring gene regulatory networks during evolution , and contributing to the establishment of tissue-specific gene regulation in development  <cit> . a breast-specific hypomethylated ltr element, mer52a, was found in the intron of the oncogenic tiam <dig> gene. this element was methylated in normal endometrium but demethylated in endometrial cancer , and its enhancer function was validated using a reporter gene assay . our study suggested that dna methylation in tes might have a much more profound impact in cancer than previously believed. consistent with our recent discovery  <cit> , we identified unmethylated tes in normal endometrium that may serve as tissue-specific enhancers. some of these te-derived, tissue-specific enhancers were hypermethylated and presumably silenced in endometrial cancer samples. in contrast, some normally methylated tes  became hypomethylated in endometrial cancer. disruption of normal dna methylation of te-derived and tissue-specific enhancers might be a novel mechanism to facilitate loss of tissue identity, acquisition of new cell type phenotypes, and to contribute to tumor development and progression . complex rewiring of gene networks by epigenetic alterations might play a critical role in endometrial carcinogenesis. however, additional data, including a comprehensive annotation of the enhancer landscape in normal endometrial cells and in endometrial cancers, are needed to further elucidate this important mechanism.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
we systematically investigated the complete dna methylome in two clinically distinct types of endometrial cancer, eac and upsc, as well as normal endometrium, providing the first whole-genome dna methylation map for this common and deadly disease. from these datasets, we identified tens of thousands of dmrs specific to the two cancer subtypes , and common to both cancer subtypes. we estimate that more than 2/ <dig> of the dmrs we identified could not be discovered by using current array-based platforms. many methylation changes were found in cpg island shores and were associated with expression changes of nearby genes. we observed large-scale dna demethylation of chromosome x in upsc accompanied by decreased xist expression. most significantly, we discovered that the majority of dmrs harbor regulatory functions including promoters and enhancers that are important to developmental and pathological changes of the uterus. among these, remethylation of transposable elements in cancers might provide a novel mechanism to deregulate normal endometrium-specific enhancers derived from specific transposable elements. our results demonstrate that dna methylation changes are an important signature of endometrial cancer and regulate gene expression by affecting not only proximal promoters, but also distal enhancers, including those derived from transposable elements.
