BACKGROUND
in the past decades, the husk surrounding the ear of maize has gained extensive attentions due to its special characters, such as operating a partial c <dig> photosynthetic pathway in contrast to stem leaves  <cit> , the proper tightness and coverage protecting the ear infected from diseases  <cit> , and directly or indirectly providing plentiful sources of anthocyanin and fibre for nutritional or industrial production  <cit> . the husk leaf area is positively correlated with the amount of cell-wall components such as the hemicellulose and cellulose fractions  <cit> . the husk area of flint corn genotypes expands fast with greater capability to synthesize xylose and arabinose, leading to the synthesis of hemicellulose  <cit> . several husk traits including the husk thickness  <cit> , the husk layer number  <cit> , the husk tightness  <cit> , the husk moisture  <cit>  and the whole growing period of husk were reported to be intimately associated with harvest grain moisture  <cit> . despite significant achievements in physiological research, we still lack the fundamental knowledge about the genetic basis underlying husk development.

plant organ growth is generally resulted from the combined activities of two cellular processes, cell division and cell expansion  <cit> . the systematic studies have demonstrated major cellular pathways integrated to regulate each process of organ growth  <cit> . in a specific manner or dependent on their crosstalk, plant hormones such as indole-3-acetic acid , cytokinins , gibberellins , brassinosteroids , abscisic acid  and strigolactones  have long been recognized as endogenous regulators of plant development  <cit> . in addition, the spatial distribution of reactive oxygen species  has been shown to define different organ growing zone and regulate meristem size  <cit> . moreover, diverse metabolic pathways like sugars  and minerals  are shown to be essential for organ growth  <cit> . furthermore, the plant secretory pathway has roles in regulating cell growth mainly through transporting and depositing cell wall-synthesizing enzymes and polysaccharides  <cit> . in maize, the mechanisms controlling the growth of numerous organs, particularly for leaf and ear, have been well interpreted, while we know nearly nothing about how husk morphogenesis is regulated at the molecular level  <cit> .

the mutant screening has proven as an efficient approach to identify ‘master regulator’ genes required for specific stage of plant development in maize  <cit> . however, the weakness of this approach is loss-of-function mutations normally resulted in extreme mutant phenotype  <cit> . therefore, the relevance of these identified genes in determining natural diversity of organ morphology in natural populations has not been easy to decipher  <cit> . based on linkage analysis, mapping quantitative trait loci  is a powerful mean to identify novel genes and allelic variants that determine phenotypic variability between parents, especially for quantitative traits  <cit> . nevertheless, the majority of qtl analyses have been limited to a small number of genotypes, which harbor only a small portion of the natural variation  <cit> . genome-wide association study , which is based on genetic linkage disequilibrium  in a panel including a large number of genotypes representing broadly natural variations, has been used as an alternative approach for exploring the molecular basis and identifying snps of complex quantitative traits . in maize, gwas has been successfully utilized to identify numerous candidate loci/genes controlling a serious of morphological or metabolic traits, such as drought tolerance  <cit> , starch content  <cit> , stalk cell wall components  <cit> , plant height  <cit> , herbivore-induced volatiles  <cit> , male inflorescence size  <cit> , shoot apical meristem size  <cit> , etc.

in this work, we used the gwas approach employing  <dig>  snps, with minor allele of frequency  ≥  <dig>  in a maize association population, to interpret the phenotypic diversity and genetic basis of four primary factors  for husk morphogenesis and their relationships with other agronomic traits. a series of candidate genes that are associated with husk growth were identified, providing a useful resource for further functional studies to understand molecular pathways involved in husk growth and development.

RESULTS
husk diversity and heritability
the association population in this study consist of a global collection of  <dig> diverse maize inbred lines and have been successfully used to dissect the genetic basis of several complex traits, including beta-carotene  <cit> , oil content  <cit> , flowering time  <cit>  and drought tolerance  <cit> .

the field trial was conducted in two environments. all four husk traits followed a normal distribution with only husk thickness  showing a slightly skew to the left . substantial variations among genotypes were observed for four husk traits . husk layer number  was highly positive correlated with ht  and negative correlated with husk length , husk width  was highly positive correlated hl  and ht , while hn and hw, hl and ht were not correlated . significant variance components for genotype  and genotype × environment  interactions were observed for all four traits as shown in table  <dig>  however, g × e interactions represented relatively a small proportion of the total variance . in addition, broad-sense heritability estimates were calculated, and the results showed moderate heritability for all three traits with hn, hl , hw  and ht , indicating that the main proportion of the phenotypic variations in husk phenotypes are derived from genetic factors, and suitable for further association mapping .fig.  <dig> frequency distributions and correlations of four husk traits. the plots on the diagonal line show the phenotypic distribution of each trait as indicated, the values above the diagonal line are pearson-correlation coefficiencies between traits, and the plots below the diagonal line are the scatter plots of compared traits. **, p ≤  <dig> .hn, the number of husk layer; hl, the husk length; hw, the husk width; ht, the husk thickness

the association panel used in this study can be divided into three subpopulations and one mixed group, which are termed by ss, nss, tst and mixed, respectively  <cit> . ss and nss subpopulations are of temperate origin, and tst subpopulation is of tropical or subtropical origin while mixed subpopulation encloses inbred lines which were not accurately assigned into the aforementioned three subpopulations based on the phylogenic analysis  <cit> . to investigate the effect of population structure on husk phenotypes, the phenotypic variations of husk traits were compared between different subpopulations. for hn, an increased mean in tst subpopulation compared to ss and nss were observed, suggesting that maize inbred lines from tropical/subtropical origin tend to have more husk layers . for hl, no any significant difference was observed, indicating that population structure has no imposed effect on this trait . for hw, an increased mean and scale in tst subpopulation compared to ss and nss were observed, suggesting that maize inbred lines from tropical/subtropical origin tend to have wider husk . the most significant variance were observed for ht, where the magnitude in tst subpopulation were remarkably larger than ss and nss, indicating that maize inbred lines from tropical/subtropical origin are generally thicker . in summary, the husk traits show broad variations which are subject to genetic regulation and have dissimilar characters according to genetic backgrounds.fig.  <dig> boxplot of husk traits distribution in different subpopulations. analysis of variance  was applied to examine the difference of traits among subpopulations. different numbers indicate statically significant difference at p ≤  <dig> . no. of inbred lines included in each subpopulation are  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for mixed, nss, ss and tst, respectively. a hn; b hl; c hw; d ht




correlation analysis of maize husk phenotypes with other agronomic traits
the nature of husk as an integral part of maize ear prompts us to investigate how husk morphology is coordinated with other agronomic traits. to achieve this aim, the pearson-correlations were calculated after comparing four husk traits with  <dig> agronomic traits which previously measured in the same association panel, including seven morphological traits, i.e. plant height , ear height , ear leaf width , ear leaf length , tassel maximum axis length , tassel branch number , leaf number above ear ; seven yield traits, i.e. ear length , ear diameter , cob diameter , kernel number per row , cob grain weight , cob weight , kernel width ; three maturity traits, i.e. days to anthesis , days to silking  and days to heading   <cit> .

the best linear unbiased prediction  was calculated from the random effects of phenotypic data to represent unbiased mean estimates. all types of husk phenotype exhibited remarkably positive correlations with the other morphological traits. the exceptions are elw for hn, lnae for hl, lnae, tbn and tmal for hw . the most significant correlations were present between hn and lnae, and between ht and lnae . the only significantly negative correlation was observed between hl and tbn . similarly, husk phenotypes showed intimate correlations with many aspects of yield trait. hn was positively correlated with cw and negatively correlated with knpr . hl and hw are positively correlated with nearly all features of yield traits with the only exceptions, which were kw for hl as well as el and knpr for hw . for ht, it displayed positive correlations with cw and kw, and negative correlation with knpr . moreover, hn, hw and ht exhibited strongly positive correlations with all the parameters reflecting maize maturity .fig.  <dig> correlation coefficients of husk phenotypes with other agronomic traits based on blup value. *significant at p ≤  <dig> ; **significant at p ≤  <dig> 




genome-wide association analysis 
to minimize the effect of environmental variation, phenotypic blup values across two environments were used for association studies. gwas was performed using a mixed linear model  and both kinship relationship  and population structure  were taken into account to avoid spurious associations   <cit> . in total, we identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> snps significantly associated with hn, hw and ht, respectively . the percentage of phenotypic variation explained by the identified snps  for hn, hw and ht were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively . in contrast, at this threshold, none of snps was detected to be significantly associated with hl. moreover, gwas was also performed using the general linear model , which identified  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> snps significantly associated with hn, hl, hw and ht, respectively . some snps were present in both methods, including  <dig> for hn and  <dig> for ht, respectively.fig.  <dig> gwas-derived manhattan plots showing significant p-values associated with husk traits using mlm and association mapping results, genomic locations and allele effects of significant snps located around representative genes for husk traits. each dot represents an snp. the horizontal dashed blue line represents the bonferroni-corrected significant threshold  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  nine unique snps that met this level are enlarged and marked with red dots. a hn; b hw; c ht; d–f regional plots showing association mapping results for snps located around grmzm2g <dig> , grmzm2g <dig> , grmzm2g <dig> ; g– i allele effects of the most significant snps for husk traits. *significant at p ≤  <dig> ; **significant at p ≤  <dig> , g

the allelic effects of haplotype coordinated with significantly differential snps on husk phenotypes were investigated and the enlarged red dots in fig. 4d − f indicate the representative loci for each trait. for hn, the selected snp  locates in the eighth intron of grmzm2g <dig> . the average hn for allele with c was  <dig> , significantly lesser than allele with g . for hw, the selected snp  locates in the fifth exon of grmzm2g <dig>  and belongs to non-synonymous with the transition from leucine  to phenylalanine . the mean hw for allele with t was  <dig>  cm, significantly narrower than allele with c . for ht, the selected snp  locates in the second exon of grmzm2g <dig>  and belongs to non-synonymous with the transition from alanine  to valine . the average ht for allele with c was  <dig>  cm, significantly thicker than allele with t .

genes co-localized with significant gwas snps
all of  <dig> snps significantly associated with husk traits identified by mlm are located in genic regions . the genes underlying these snps were grouped into several functional categories, exemplified by  <dig> genes involved in metabolic pathways,  <dig> genes in secretory transport,  <dig> gene in transcriptional regulation and  <dig> gene in cellular transport . in addition,  <dig> out of  <dig> significant snps identified by glm are located in genic regions . the functional categories of these genes were exemplified by  <dig> genes involved in metabolic pathways,  <dig> genes in transcriptional regulation,  <dig> gene in signal transduction,  <dig> gene in cellular transport,  <dig> genes in intracellular trafficking and  <dig> gene in the reduction-oxidation reaction  .

to determine whether these genes denoted by significant snps were functional in the manner of tissue-specific expression, the in silico expression pattern was compiled using the published rna-seq datasets from  <dig> different organs/tissues, including husk . the dataset used in this analysis was listed in additional file 2: table s <dig>  as shown in fig.  <dig> and additional file 2: table s <dig>  a set of candidate genes showed a tendency of higher expression in husk relative to other tissues. subsequently, the quantitative real-time pcr  was conducted to validate the expression pattern of selective ten genes, including a total of nine genes present in mlm model and two genes in glm model displaying relatively high expression in husk shown in fig  <dig>  it is noted that since grmzm2g <dig> was not detectable by rt-qpcr, it is excluded from this analysis. as shown in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  except of grmzm2g <dig> and grmzm2g <dig>  all the other eight genes exhibited more or less higher expression in husk relative to most of tissues tested. the highly expressions in husk further suggest the relevance of these candidate genes to act in husk morphogenesis.fig.  <dig> heat-map of tissue-specific expression patterns of candidate genes identified by gwas. the values used in the figure are the log <dig> transformed ratio of normalized prkm count in husk relative to that in other tissues as shown at the bottom of each column. columns and rows are ordered according to similarity . the orange, white, and blue represent higher in husk than other tissues, close to other tissues, and lower than other tissues of a particular gene, respectively




discussion
maize husk constitutes the leafy outer of ear and protects cob from dehydration and pathogen infection  <cit> . therefore, the husk morphogenesis must be delicately coordinated with ear growth and development. in the past decades, due to the direct influence to grain production, the ear development in maize received extensive attentions  <cit> . the genetic architecture of several ear-related traits has been illustrated in diverse maize populations , and several key genes involving in ear development have been characterized  <cit> . in contrast, the genetic basis and the molecular pathways underlying husk morphology remain largely unknown. in this study, we interpret the natural variation and the associated genetic architecture of four primary husk traits in an association panel, and a set of putative candidate genes and pathways controlling husk development were revealed by performing gwas analysis.

genetic basis of husk traits
all of four husk traits investigated in this study exhibited widely phenotypic variations with normal distribution. the genetic analysis shows that the heritability for hn, hl and ht and are higher than hw. the genetic contributions are significant, whereas the interaction of genetic and environmental effect was also significant for all traits.

the significant correlation is present between hl and hw, indicating that the growth and development of husk is coordinated in the aspect of length and width at a population level. the number of husk layer and the width of each layer constitute two basic factors which determine ht, and therefore, it is not surprising to observe that ht is positively correlated with hn and hw. in contrast, hl and ht are not correlated, indicating that the husk growth at the dimension of length has no effect on the thickness.

maize is originated from tropical regions, and subsequently adapted into subtropical regions, and therefore, population structure may have imposed effects on maize morphology  <cit> . in this study, we observed that population structure has different effects on three husk traits. for hl, no significant difference was observed between subpopulations, indicating that the growth of husk in the dimension of length is parallel among each subpopulation. in contrast, the inbreds from tropical origin possess more layer of husk, as well as appear wider and thicker than those from subtropical origin, indicating that the shift of maize lines from tropical region to subtropical regions is accompanied with the characters of decreasing, narrowing and lessening husk growth.

coordination of husk morphology with other processes of plant development
as an integral part of ear, the growth and development of husk and ear would be intimately correlated. this is the case in our study. we observed a fairly close relationship of husk phenotypes with the corresponding features describing ear morphology. for instance, only hl, but not hn, hw or ht is highly correlated with el. meanwhile, hw is positively correlated with ed and cd, suggesting that the long or wide ears are endogenously enclosed by long or wide husk, respectively. in addition, all the husk traits show significantly positive correlations with cw, a parameter directly contributed by ear size, indicative of the fitness of husk establishment to the ears with large size. knpr is positive correlated with hl, which is conceivable since the longer ears may create more space to allow additional kernels. interestingly, however, knpr showed negatively correlated hn and ht. this might be partly explained that hl and hn are negatively correlated, and the inbred lines with longer husk are companied with the reduction in the arithmetic formation of husk layer, consequently leading to the thinner ht.

as discussed above, the overall framework between husk and ear would be deliberately cooperated. meanwhile, we found that the husk phenotypes also exhibited the substantially positively correlations with many aspects of maize morphological traits, indicating that the proper formation of husk morphology is intimately synchronized with the other aspects of plant growth and development. the most intriguing correlations were observed for hn, hw and ht with all the indexes reflecting maize maturity, indicating that the longer duration of growing period in maize is endowed with the features consisting of more layers of husk, as well as wider and thicker husk. taken together, the correlation analyses between husk phenotypes with other agronomic traits reveal a number of both predictable and unpredictable associations, suggesting that husk morphology is coordinated with or affected by other processes of plant growth.

putative genes and pathways involved in husk morphogenesis
plant organ formation consist of an initial phase of cell fate decision and cell division, leading to the construction of primary morphogenesis, then followed with a second phase of cell expansion and secondary morphogenesis  <cit> . a diverse range of genes are involved in the orchestration of organ formation by promoting or inhibiting component processes or pathways  <cit> . while the cellular pathway and its regulation attributing to ear development have been extensively studied in maize, entirely nothing is known about how husk morphogenesis is controlled at molecular levels  <cit> . gwas has been proved to be a powerful tool to rapidly discover prospective genes related to traits under investigation in crops . in this study, we totally identify  <dig> genes significantly correlated with husk phenotype by mlm method and  <dig> genes by glm method as well as.  <dig> genes are present in both methods. functional annotation revealed that these candidate genes are mainly grouped into a few of functional groups, such as membrane vesicle trafficking, transcriptional regulation, redox and cellular transports, all of which have been reported to be critical for diverse processes of plant organ growth .

intracellular trafficking of membrane-coated vesicles represents a fundamental process that regulates the flow of membrane materials among different endomembrane compartments inside and outside of the cell  <cit> . key trafficking pathways consist of an inward flux of endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane and an outward flux of exocytic vesicles to the plasma membrane  <cit> . the major proteins underlying membrane trafficking include four phases of trafficking process, the components of which include vesicle coats, motors like myosin, adaptor complexes, snare proteins and rab gtpases, and so on . in arabidopsis, several membrane trafficking-related genes have been shown to participate in diverse aspects of organ growth by affecting cytokinesis, a crucial procedure for successful cell division  <cit> . in this study, beside three genes encoding transmembrane protein, four genes directly involving in vesicle trafficking were identified, and fall into different phase of trafficking process. grmzm2g <dig> encodes a subunit of coatomer, a protein complex required for golgi non-clathrin-coated vesicles. grmzm2g <dig> encodes a myosin protein, which helps to transport vesicles along a cytoskeletal track  <cit> . grmzm2g <dig> encodes an adaptin protein, which mediate the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles. grmzm2g <dig> encodes a homolog of the yeast vps52p/sac <dig>  the homologs in yeast has been shown to function in a complex participated in retrograde trafficking of vesicles between the endosomal compartment and the trans-golgi network  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the disruption of vps52p/sac <dig> led to the defect in pollen tube germination and growth  <cit> . with regard to the vital roles of intracellular trafficking in regulating plant organogenesis  <cit> , the finding of these candidate genes implies that the intracellular trafficking pathway may have significant effects on the natural variations in husk traits.

regulation of gene expression plays a central role in deciding the production of specific gene. gene expression can be regulated at multiple levels, from chromatin organization, to dna-rna transcription initiation, to rna processing, and to the post-translational modification of a protein . we totally found  <dig> genes which are potentially acting in different levels of gene expression regulation, including a chromatin remodeling factor , a mediator for rna polymerase ii ,  <dig> transcriptional regulators ,  <dig> rna-binding proteins  and a rna editing factor .

metabolism is an indispensable part of a plant life cycle and contributes to a large part of plant phenotype performance  <cit> . the disruptions of some certain metabolic pathways have profound influences on plant growth and development  <cit> . identical to other organs, husk growth must be a dynamic process that involves an interconnected series of metabolic pathways. therefore, it is not surprising to identify a large number of candidate genes acting in diverse metabolic pathways associated with husk phenotypes. the representative pathways we identified include cytokinin , ja , sulfur , cellulose , flavonol , pectin , nucleotide  and glyoxylate . cellulose synthase, encoded by a medium size of gene family in maize, have important roles in cell wall formation  <cit> . a previous study has shown that the mutation in one of the members, csld, caused a substantial reduction in leaf width  <cit>  here, we identified two genes belonging to cellulose synthase and are significantly associated with hl and hw, respectively. taken together, we speculate that the variation of these metabolic pathways in natural maize population may integrate together to control the diversity of husk morphology.

CONCLUSIONS
the initial incentive of the present study is, until now, we lack any knowledge about genetic architecture and mechanism controlling natural variation in maize husk development. the results show that the husk morphological traits are moderately inheritable, showing a broad variation in a population containing  <dig> global diverse inbred lines genotyped by  <dig>  polymorphic snp markers. the gwas demonstrated there are a number of genetic loci with small effect on regulating the natural variation in husk morphology, reflective of the complexity of husk development in maize. the candidate genes underlying these associated loci provide invaluable resource for the further study to functionally dissect the molecular network in regulating maize husk development, and the identification of snp polymorphisms will be very useful for marker-assisted selection of husk traits in breeding program.
