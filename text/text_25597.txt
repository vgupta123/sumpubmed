BACKGROUND
two key functions of the cell cycle machinery are to ensure  that dna replication is completed before cells enter mitosis and  that dna replication is limited to once per cell cycle such that re-initiation of dna replication does not occur on newly replicated dna until after cells have passed through mitosis. thus dna replication is tightly controlled to ensure that the genome is copied once and only once within a cell cycle.

dna replication is regulated at three successive steps:  binding of proteins necessary for initiation onto dna during the m and g <dig> phases of the cell cycle,  initiation at origins during s phase, and  imposition of re-replication restraints during the s and g <dig> phases.

in the fission yeast, schizosaccharomyces pombe, overall control of replication is provided by the cyclin-dependent kinase, cdc <dig> , whose activity drives the cell cycle. low cdk <dig> activity during late m phase and g <dig> phase permits the first step of replication, formation of pre-replication complexes  at replication origins. pre-rcs include orc proteins  together with cdc <dig>  cdt <dig>  and mcm proteins . at the end of g <dig>  cdk <dig> activity begins to increase, triggering the second step: initiation of replication at subsets of pre-rcs throughout s phase .

once s phase has begun, the relatively high level of cdk <dig> activity inhibits formation of new pre-rcs and thus inhibits re-initiation on already-replicated segments of dna. as s phase continues, cdk <dig> activity increases further, strengthening the inhibition of re-replication. in fission yeast, active cdk <dig> inhibits new pre-rc formation by multiple pathways, including direct phosphorylation of cdc <dig>  <cit>  and orc <dig>  <cit>  and destruction of cdc <dig>  <cit>  and cdt <dig>  <cit> . similarly, in budding yeast multiple cdk1-dependent pathways inhibit re-replication by preventing the formation of new pre-rcs. these pathways include cdk1-dependent phosphorylation of orc <dig>  orc <dig>  and cdc <dig> , destruction of cdc <dig>  and nuclear export of cdt <dig> and mcm2- <dig> . related pathways similarly limit dna replication to once per cell cycle in metazoans . even though cell cycle progression and cdk <dig> activate multiple pathways that restrict dna replication to once per cell cycle, these controls can be disrupted in s. pombe by high level expression of a single protein, cdc <dig>  <cit> .

two-dimensional  gel analysis has shown that some re-replication events begin at sequences previously identified as s-phase origins in fission yeast  <cit> , and both 2-d gel analyses  <cit>  and genome-wide microarray studies of copy number changes  <cit>  have shown that, as expected, re-replication also begins at sequences previously identified as s-phase origins in budding yeast. even though re-replication appears to be initiated from sites that also function as s-phase replication origins, two genome-wide studies in budding yeast have both concluded that origin use during re-replication is distinctly different from origin timing or efficiency during normal s phase  <cit> . regions that are re-replicated in fission yeast have yet to be determined, as the only origin so far tested during re-replication in fission yeast is that of ribosomal dna, ars <dig>  <cit> .

in budding yeast, when cdk <dig> phosphorylation sites in orc <dig>  orc <dig>  cdc <dig>  and mcms are mutated or circumvented and cdc <dig> is over-expressed, dna re-replication is limited to a maximum dna accumulation of ~3–4c in haploid cells  <cit> . even after all known mechanisms to prevent re-replication in budding yeast have been eliminated, multiple restraints remain. first, pre-rcs re-assemble at only a subset of the sites used for a normal s phase  <cit> . second, of these only a subset are selected for replication re-initiation  <cit> . finally, there is some evidence that fork processivity may be reduced during re-replication  <cit> . the mechanisms for these remaining restraints are unknown. they may be responsible for the budding yeast differences between s-phase replication and re-replication. it has also been suggested by tanny et al. that differences in chromatin organization and/or gene expression between s phase and g <dig> may change origin selection and/or efficiency between s-phase replication and re-replication  <cit> .

in s. pombe, over-expression of cdc <dig> is sufficient to drive re-replication and this re-replication can be further increased by mutating phosphorylation sites in cdc <dig>  by also mutating phosphorylation sites in orc <dig>  or by simultaneously over-expressing cdt <dig>  <cit> . reasons for the different sensitivities of fission yeast and budding yeast to re-replication are unclear.

in budding yeast, re-replication leads to double-stranded dna  breaks and activation of checkpoint protein rad <dig> that is dependent on dna damage response proteins  <cit> . in x. laevis egg extracts, re-replication induced by addition of recombinant cdt <dig> leads to activation of chk <dig>  and the presence of small dsdna fragments  <cit> . in human cells, re-replication induced by  inactivation or depletion of the cdt <dig> inhibitor, geminin  <cit> ,  depletion of proteins integral for the degradation of cdt <dig>  ddb <dig> or cdt <dig>  <cit> ,  depletion of emi <dig>   <cit> , or  over-expression of cdt <dig> and cdc <dig> with cyclina-cdk <dig>  <cit>  activates the atm/atr/chk <dig> dna damage pathways. accumulation of single-stranded and double-stranded dna has also been observed during re-replication  <cit> .

it is possible that this re-replication-induced checkpoint activation in turn influences the patterns of re-replication. the relation between checkpoints and origin selection during re-replication is unknown. dna-replication and dna-damage checkpoint pathways are highly conserved among eukaryotes. the fission yeast rad <dig> checkpoint kinase  is a homologue of vertebrate atr and of budding yeast mec <dig>  rad <dig> is activated in response to blocked replication forks or dna damage. the cds <dig> checkpoint kinase  is activated after phosphorylation by rad <dig> in response to stalled replication forks or dna damage during s phase. cds <dig> is a homologue of vertebrate chk2/cds <dig> and of budding yeast rad <dig>  a different kinase, chk <dig>  is activated by rad <dig> in response to dna damage in late s and g <dig> phases. chk <dig> homologues, with the same name, are also present in vertebrates and in budding yeast .

in this study, we drove re-replication in s. pombe by over-expression of a mutant cdc <dig> protein and then used microarrays to find out if specific regions in the genome are preferentially amplified during re-replication. we then repeated these experiments in cds1Δ and rad3Δ cells to find out if checkpoint responses determine regional susceptibility to re-replication.

RESULTS
over-expression of cdc18* increases dna content ~four-fold
re-replication in our experiments was driven by inducing the cdc18* gene, encoding the cdc18* protein, from an integrated allele regulated by the nmt <dig> promoter. cdc18* lacks cdk <dig> phosphorylation sites at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . phosphorylation of these sites is important for cdk <dig> downregulation of cdc <dig> function, for targeting cdc <dig> for proteolysis  <cit>  and probably also for cdc <dig> inhibition of cdk <dig> . a major goal of this study was to compare re-replication in wild-type cells with re-replication in checkpoint mutant cells. figure  <dig> describes the effects of cdc18* overexpression on cell morphology, cell cycle arrest, and dna re-replication in wild-type as well as cds1Δ and rad3Δ mutants. in the strains studied here, cdc18+ remains at its normal locus, and cells grow normally as long as cdc18* is repressed. removing thiamine  from the medium turned on the nmt <dig> promoter and induced cdc18*. cdc18* protein was detectable by  <dig> hours , and re-replication was detectable by  <dig> hours .

cdc18*-driven re-replication doubled the dna content per cell from 2c  to an average value > 4c  or ~4c  by  <dig> hours as determined by flow cytometry . though highly variable from cell to cell, the dna content of wild-type and cds1Δ cells approximately doubled again between  <dig> and  <dig> hours. the average dna content of rad3Δ cells increased only slightly if at all during this time interval. from  <dig> to  <dig> hours, there was increased variability but little change in average dna content per cell in all three strains. the flow cytometry profiles are consistent with dna re-replication models ranging from dna accumulation by repeated re-replication of a few regions of the genome to continuous, albeit slow, whole genome re-replication. if the re-replicating cells are in a continuous "re-replication" phase, then dna re-replication is inefficient compared with normal s-phase replication, which doubles dna content in 20– <dig> minutes under growth conditions similar to those used here.

use of microarrays to determine which regions are re-replicated
we used microarray analyses of dna copy number – a procedure which has come to be called comparative genomic hybridization  – to distinguish between the possibility that re-replication affects sequences genome-wide and the possibility that re-replication is limited to a small subset of sequences and drives dna accumulation by high amplification, onion-skin-like replication bubbles similar to those generated during chorion gene amplification in drosophila melanogaster . if re-replication only affected a few regions in the genome – for instance, if only half of genomic sequences were susceptible to re-replication – then, by  <dig> hours when the total amount of dna is increased four-fold, we would expect an eight-fold difference in copy number between re-replicated dna regions and the regions that are not re-replicated. on the other hand, if re-replication occurred uniformly genome-wide, we would expect little or no variation in copy number from region to region no matter how long re-replication continued.

to determine relative copy number, dnas harvested from re-replicating cells at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours after cdc18* induction  and dna from the same strain at  <dig> hours, when cdc18* was repressed , were labeled and hybridized competitively to microarrays. overall ratios of re-replicated dna to control dna were normalized to  <dig> . thus if a probe sequence was re-replicated an average amount, its ratio would be  <dig>  even if the genome was four-fold over-replicated . relatively amplified sequences would have ratios greater than  <dig> , and regions that failed to re-replicate or re-replicated less than average would have ratios less than  <dig> . individual probe values from replicate hybridizations were averaged and graphed for the 17-, 21-, and 25-hour time points, without smoothing or averaging of neighboring probe values . probe values are provided in additional files  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> .

dna re-replication varied regionally such that stretches of hundreds of kilobases were relatively amplified during re-replication or were relatively under-re-replicated. wild-type results are shown in figure  <dig>  results for the cds1Δ and rad3Δ strains are in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  some of the probes appeared to re-replicate significantly more or less than the other probes in their regions, giving rise to the sharp spikes and valleys evident in figure  <dig>  we are not yet certain of the significance of these spikes and valleys. they may represent noise, or they may represent "hot spots" of over- or under-replication. they are the subject of continuing investigation. for this reason, in the remainder of this manuscript we shall focus on the regional variations and ignore the spikes and valleys.

regional amplification increased somewhat between  <dig> and  <dig> hours and changed little between  <dig> and  <dig> hours. the degree of relative amplification was generally modest , and the regions of amplification remained stable over time. the highest level of amplification represented by multiple adjacent probes was ~2-fold. therefore no individual regions consistently re-replicated to very high ploidies, and most of the genome was re-replicated somewhat. a few regions represented by multiple probes were under-represented by ~ <dig> -fold and therefore failed to re-replicate in many cells. microarray analysis of amplification during re-replication was highly reproducible for all three time points.

since some regions were re-replicated more than two-fold over others, the re-replicating cells must contain replication forks and/or double-strand breaks. it is expected that such structures will activate dna-replication and/or dna-damage checkpoint pathways. given the importance of dna-replication and dna-damage checkpoint responses for genome stability and the roles of these pathways in controlling replication initiation and fork processivity, we next sought to determine to what extent these pathways regulate, modify, or restrain dna re-replication in s. pombe.

roles of rad <dig> and cds <dig> in cell cycle arrest during dna re-replication
to find out how replication-checkpoint and dna-damage-response signals affect dna re-replication in s. pombe, inducible cdc18* was combined with deletions of the cds <dig> and rad <dig> genes. like the cdc18* strain , the cdc18* cds1Δ and cdc18* rad3Δ double-mutant strains  are viable when cdc18* is repressed, and all three strains show 90–95% loss in viability  <dig> hours after cdc18* induction . deletion of cds <dig> abrogates the replication checkpoint, and cds <dig> is important for maintaining functional replication forks during replication stress . cds <dig> is able to arrest the cell cycle in hu-treated cells, but cds <dig> is not required for this cell cycle arrest, because the dna-damage responsive chk <dig> kinase has overlapping functions with cds <dig> and is also able to arrest the cell cycle. the rad <dig> kinase  is required for both the cds <dig> and chk <dig> pathways. thus cells lacking rad <dig> cannot arrest the cell cycle in response to either replication stress or dna damage.

over-expression of cdc18* was sufficient for initial cell-cycle arrest in all three strains studied here, including the rad3Δ strain; however, maintenance of the cdc18* cell-cycle arrest was strongly dependent on rad <dig> and partially dependent on cds <dig>  fission yeast in a cell-cycle arrest become highly elongated, remain uni-nucleate, and lack septa. at  <dig> hours, the wild-type cells remained fully cell-cycle arrested. fewer than 1% of these cells had septa or were bi-nucleate , and >90% of these cells were highly elongated. at  <dig> hours, most of the cds1Δ cells also maintained the cell cycle arrest . in contrast, by  <dig> hours, the rad3Δ cells had resumed division , and due to the failure to maintain cell cycle arrest, only 53% of the rad3Δ cells were highly elongated, unseptated, and uni-nucleate. by  <dig> hours, 5% of wild-type, 11% of cds1Δ, and 16% of rad3Δ cells were bi-nucleate. thus, by  <dig> hours even wild-type cells were imperfect in maintaining the cell cycle arrest, and the cds1Δ strain had a clear arrest defect in a small subset of cells .

our flow cytometric results also suggested that cell-cycle arrest requires rad <dig>  figure 1c shows forward scatter  versus florescence per cell . most wild-type and cds1Δ cells were elongated and contained large amounts of dna . however, rad3Δ cells were much shorter and had less dna per cell than wild-type, as expected for cells that fail to maintain cell-cycle arrest . because a large fraction of rad3Δ cells were dividing, flow cytometry cannot be used to quantitate the extent of re-replication driven by cdc18* in this strain. however, we are confident that re-replication took place, because  dna content was greater than 2c for the majority of cells at 17– <dig> hours ,  the pattern of over-replication measured by microarray analysis was similar to that of wild-type and cds1Δ cells , and  cells lost viability similarly to wild-type. based on microscopy of dapi-stained cells, most divisions in rad3Δ cells at  <dig> hours and later were aberrant, with unequal divisions of nuclei as well as strings of dna between divided nuclei . such aberrant divisions could be generated by attempting to segregate chromosomes with partially re-replicated dna.

regional amplification is largely independent of rad <dig> and cds1
genomic dnas from re-replicating cds1Δ and rad3Δ cells were labeled and hybridized against genomic dna from wild-type cellswith cdc18* repressed . hybridization results were normalized to  <dig>  for each array, triplicate hybridizations were averaged, and individual probe values were graphed along each chromosome for  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours  and are provided in additional files  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . as for wild-type cells, cds1Δ and rad3Δ profiles were highly reproducible at the  <dig> time points, with the magnitude of the effects slightly greater at  <dig> and  <dig> hours than at  <dig> hours.

the amplified regions were similar in all three strains at all three times as seen by comparing the nine plots for each chromosome shown in figure  <dig> and additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  to show comparisons more simply, the highly similar  <dig> and  <dig> hour times were averaged and then plotted for each of the three strains in figure  <dig>  the wild-type and cds1Δ results are nearly identical. distinct differences can be seen between the wild-type or cds1Δ strains and the rad3Δ strain, but the overall locations of amplified regions are generally the same. exceptions are discussed below.

the similarity between the cds1Δ and wild-type strains  indicates that control of replication origin function by cds <dig> has little effect on origin activity during re-replication. this was initially surprising to us. however, during the course of these studies, we found that cds <dig> and rad <dig> significantly restrain only about 3% of origins and significantly stimulate only about 5% of origins during s-phase replication in hu-treated fission yeast cells  <cit> . but even within that small subset of origins , none was similarly affected by checkpoint mutations during re-replication . the striking similarity between re-replication in the cds1Δ and wild-type strains also suggests that replication fork movement is similar in these strains while they are undergoing re-replication. in contrast, when these strains are treated with hu during normal s phase, replication fork movement is much slower in cds1Δ  cells than in wild-type cells  <cit> .

we detected three distinct, but minor, differences between the patterns of re-replication in cds1Δ or wild-type cells and those in rad3Δ cells. first, if one carefully examines figure  <dig>  many small peaks of amplification are visible in the rad3Δ strain that are undetectable in the other two strains. these rad3Δ-specific peaks are correlated with locations of relatively strong origins in hu-treated cells. second, the amplified regions in rad3Δ cells have more distinct boundaries than do the peaks in wild-type or cds1Δ cells. this might result from reduced fork rate or lower fork processivity in the rad3Δ strain.

third, the telomeres of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  centromeres on all chromosomes, and the mating-type region on chromosome  <dig> are preferentially amplified in rad3Δ cells . in this respect these three types of heterochromatin behave similarly to each other – in contrast to normal s phase, where telomeric heterochromatin is late-replicating and checkpoint-regulated, while centromeric and mating-type heterochromatin are early-replicating and not affected by the replication checkpoint . amplification of telomere regions is analyzed in more detail in the next section.

these results for the rad3Δ strain are preliminary because rad3Δ cells continued mitotic divisions during re-replication whereas wild-type and cds1Δ cells did not. therefore, we cannot distinguish whether rad3Δ-specific effects are due to rad3-specific functions or to interruption of re-replication by mitosis, possibly followed by an s phase.

amplification of telomeric regions during re-replication
microarray copy number analyses indicate that s. pombe telomeric regions are amplified during re-replication. our data show that replication forks must be initiated in telomeres or within the subtelomeric regions during re-replication. telomere-associated amplification is evident in the wild-type and cds1Δ strains, and the effect is magnified in the rad3Δ strain, as described above and in figure  <dig>  to focus analysis on telomeric regions as a class, figure  <dig> displays probe values as a function of distance from telomeres. note that chromosome  <dig> is excluded from this analysis, because it terminates in rdna repeats rather than in the telomere-associated sequences located at the ends of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  also note that our arrays detect sequences near to the telomeres rather than telomere repeats themselves.

the wild-type and cds1Δ sub-telomeric amplified regions span 50– <dig> kb from the ends of chromosomes and are followed by under-re-replicated regions which extend out to ~ <dig> kb from the chromosome ends . the rad3Δ sub-telomeric amplified regions are larger, spanning up to 100– <dig> kb from the chromosome ends . as in the wild-type and cds1Δ strains, the sub-telomeric amplified regions in rad3Δ cells are followed by under-re-replicated regions.

the pattern of re-replication near telomeres in s. pombe appears to be the same as re-replication near telomeres in the distantly related budding yeast, s. cerevisiae, when re-replication is induced in g2/m phase . analysis of re-replication in budding yeast showed re-replication of telomeric regions in which the terminal ~ <dig> kb is amplified greater than average for the genome and the following > <dig> kb is under-re-replicated  <cit> . that this distinct pattern of re-replication adjacent to telomeres is conserved between the highly diverged fission and budding yeasts suggests that this may be a basic feature of re-replication near telomeres and therefore may also occur in metazoans.

origin use during re-replication is distinct from s-phase replication
in all three strains studied, dna re-replication varied regionally such that stretches of hundreds of kilobases were amplified during re-replication or were relatively under-replicated . given that most of the genome is subject to re-replication, one possibility is that re-replication is primarily a repeat of s-phase. if so, then normal s-phase origins, unusually active individual s-phase origins, or clusters of s-phase origins might be determinants of which sequences are amplified during re-replication. to investigate this idea, we compared the re-replication profiles for all three chromosomes with various measures of s-phase origins  including predicted origin distribution  <cit> , distribution of  <dig> -kb stretches of unusually high at content, origin activity in hu-treated s-phase cells , early s-phase replication , and localization of orc and mcm proteins  <cit> . these comparisons led us to conclude that determinants of re-replication efficiency are distinct from normal s-phase replication. by way of example, figure  <dig> shows comparisons of chromosome  <dig> re-replication with measures of s-phase replication and origin distribution. figure 5a shows data for all of chromosome  <dig>  while figure 5b shows a magnified view of the 1-mbp region highlighted in fig. 5a. the large zones of re-replication common to wild-type, cds1Δ  and rad3Δ cells failed to show a clear one-to-one correspondence with s-phase replication in synchronous or hu-treated cells.

the more detailed view in figure 5b shows that the peak of regional amplification is displaced about  <dig> kb toward the telomere from the local peaks of highest s-phase replication. the re-replication peak is aligned closely with the region at1041+, which appears to have medium function as an s-phase origin. at1041+ is flanked for long distances on both sides by regions that, according to microarray analyses, did not replicate significantly in cells entering s phase in the presence of hu  <cit> .

if re-replication amplification peaks result from use of multiple origins in a region, then the center of amplification in the population need not be located at an origin but could lie between origins. it has been calculated that 80% of re-replication peaks lie within  <dig> kb of a pro-ars in budding yeast, and re-replication peaks can in some cases be assigned to a single origin in this organism  <cit> . correlation between re-replication peaks and s-phase origins is less clear in fission yeast, though likely origins can be identified in some cases such as at1041+ described above. figure  <dig> shows origin strength and distribution determined for s-phase replication in hu. to look at the effects of groups or clusters of origins, the numbers and activities of origins were evaluated in a sliding window of  <dig> kb. even with this approach, there were differences between s-phase origins and re-replication, suggesting that the determinants of re-replication differ in some respects from the determinants of origin function during normal s-phase replication.

finally, the sequences replicated during hu-arrested s phase and the sequences amplified during re-replication in wild-type and cds1Δ cells  are poorly correlated . as noted above, there are many smaller peaks of amplification in rad3Δ cells which aligned with clusters of active origins in the replication profile . consistent with this, there is a small degree of correlation between the sequences replicated during hu-arrested s phase and the sequences amplified after re-replication was induced in rad3Δ cells . this correlation could be due to characteristics of re-replication in the absence of rad <dig> or it could be an indirect result of ongoing division, possibly followed by "normal" s phases, in the rad3Δ mutant. regardless of the explanation, our ability to detect such correlation in the rad3Δ mutant emphasizes the absence of similar correlation in wild-type and cds1Δ cells.

discussion
by using microarrays to measure copy number, we have found that over-expression in fission yeast of the cdc18* replication initiation protein that has mutations in cdk <dig> phosphorylation sites drove re-replication of broad regions throughout the genome, rather than driving abundant re-replication of just a few sequences. re-replication was independent of the replication checkpoint mediated by cds <dig>  re-replication also seems to be largely independent of the rad <dig> checkpoint. however, our results obtained with rad3Δ cells are preliminary, due to the fact that these cells continue to divide even after re-replication is induced. in all three cell types , we found amplified  regions spanning hundreds of kilobases. these were distinct from the broad regions containing strong origins observed in normal s phase. greatest amplification occurred near the fission yeast telomeres and closely matched the pattern of telomere-associated amplification observed during budding yeast re-replication  <cit> .

re-replication and the cell cycle
in principle, re-replication can take place either within s phase  or in g <dig> phase. in recently published genome-wide studies of re-replication in budding yeast, green et al.  <cit>  and tanny et al.  <cit>  employed cells arrested in g2/m with nocodazole to ensure absence of contributions from cells still in s phase. both groups found that origin selection during re-replication induced in g2/m is markedly different from origin selection during s phase. tanny et al.  <cit>  showed that part of this difference could be attributed to the fact that, during re-replication, pre-rcs were re-loaded onto g <dig> chromatin at only a subset of the origins where they would normally be loaded during g <dig> in preparation for a normal s phase. in addition, tanny et al.  <cit>  concluded that many origins that did re-load pre-rcs were not subsequently selected to fire during re-replication. the nature of this additional restraint is not known. both groups found that there was little or no correlation between s-phase origin efficiency or the time in s phase when an origin is normally functional and the likelihood of that origin being active for re-replication  <cit> .

how can one explain the profound difference between re-replication induced during g2/m phase and normal replication during s phase replication? it is possible that g2- or m-phase-specific chromatin modifications or condensation might contribute to the re-replication program observed in nocodazole-arrested cells. to explore this possibility, green et al.  <cit>  also studied re-replication initiated during an s phase. they found that the s-phase re-replication patterns were partially similar to those generated by re-replication in g2/m. however, the peaks of s-phase re-replication corresponded somewhat better than those of g2/m re-replication to the positions and timings of origins used during normal s phase. a difference between re-replication during g2/m and re-replication initiated in s phase was that, during g2/m, telomeres were extensively re-replicated. in contrast, telomeres were under-amplified when re-replication was initiated during s phase  <cit> .

for our study, we induced cdc18* over-expression in logarithmically growing, unsynchronized cells. in this case, differences between re-replication and replication cannot be attributed to a mitotic-arrested state of the cells. nevertheless, s. pombe showed major differences between re-replication and s-phase replication similar to those seen in nocodazole-arrested budding yeast. furthermore, the amplification of telomeric regions during s. pombe re-replication resembles telomere-region amplification during re-replication in nocodazole-arrested budding yeast. the normally late replication of these regions might account for failure to detect their amplification when re-replication was induced during s phase in budding yeast. it is truly remarkable that parameters of re-replication should be so similar across the huge evolutionary distance between fission and budding yeasts and across the considerably different experimental designs.

re-replication under the experimental conditions in this study appeared to require ~ <dig> hours for a doubling of dna content , compared with a typical s-phase duration of ~ <dig> minutes. thus, within individual cells, there must either be large periods of time that are not permissive for re-replication, or re-replication must be inefficient relative to s-phase replication. the fact that cds1Δ and wild-type cells re-replicated with essentially identical kinetics  suggests that the explanation  for the difference in dna doubling times between normal s phase and our re-replication conditions is probably independent of the replication checkpoint.

we had not anticipated that rad3Δ cells would be able to divide during re-replication driven by overexpression of cdc18*, because overexpression of wild-type cdc <dig> can cause a rad3-independent block to mitosis  <cit> . our results are consistent with the model that the cdc18* used in this study resembles a cdc <dig> n-terminal deletion mutant, which cannot block mitosis independently of rad <dig>  <cit> . cdc18* lacks four of the five n-terminal cdk <dig> phosphorylation sites, and analogous sites in budding yeast cdc <dig> are required for cdk <dig> inhibition  <cit> . it seems likely that cdc18* is defective as a direct inhibitor of cdk <dig> and so would depend on the rad <dig> pathway to inhibit cdk <dig> and prevent cells from entering mitosis. because the rad3Δ cells were able to divide when overexpressing cdc18*, while wild-type and cds1Δ cells were not, we conclude that rad <dig> is important for detecting ongoing re-replication and for generating a checkpoint response capable of inhibiting cell division. our data further indicate that cds <dig> plays a small, but detectable, role in the checkpoint response to re-replication, because cds <dig> was required to maintain the cell-cycle arrest in some cells. that most cds1Δ cells maintain the arrest is likely due to activation of the chk1-dependent damage checkpoint pathway. consistent with this idea, re-replicating cells lacking chk <dig> also have partial defects maintaining cell cycle arrest . these observations are consistent with reports that re-replication generates dna damage and activates checkpoint responses in other eukaryotes  <cit> .

regional re-replication
as green et al. and tanny et al. had found for nocodazole-arrested budding yeast  <cit> , we found that amplification during re-replication was poorly correlated with s-phase replication in fission yeast. in contrast with the yeast results, a strong correlation was apparent between re-replication in a mammalian cell line and euchromatic sequences normally replicated during early s phase, based on using re-replicated dna for fish hybridization to metaphase chromosomes  <cit> . thus the regional determinants of re-replication in eukaryotes still hold many mysteries.

intriguingly, in fission yeast, budding yeast, and mammalian cells, re-replication was seen to affect large regions rather than applying evenly to the genome  <cit> . in fission yeast, we found that large regions of hundreds of kilobases were amplified, interspersed with large regions that re-replicated less than average. broad regions are most simply explained as being the result of one or a few initiations near the region centers. each amplified region would be replicated by forks moving outward from its center. if forks travel at  <dig> to  <dig> kb/minute, as calculated by rivin and fangman for budding yeast  <cit> , or at  <dig>  kb/minute as proposed by heichinger et al. for s. pombe  <cit> , then bi-directional forks starting at one origin could replicate  <dig> – <dig>  mbp in four hours, the approximate time frame in which total dna content doubles during re-replication in our study. this is consistent with the observed sizes of the amplified regions. the lack of correspondence between fission yeast re-replication peak centers and origins known to be very active in s phase could result from use of origins that are normally inefficient during s phase, or from stochastic use of several sites of initiation during re-replication – with the caveat that, for some of these origins, relative efficiency would be different between s phase and re-replication. the overall similarity between fission yeast and budding yeast re-replication suggests that re-replication-specific origin preference might be a general phenomenon rather than a special property of the model organism or the details of the experimental design.

minimal effect of the cds1-dependent replication checkpoint during re-replication
considering that re-replication is a form of replication, we initially expected that the replication checkpoint might be activated. we were therefore surprised to see that, for every characteristic that we measured, wild-type and cds1Δ cells proved to be similar or identical. indeed, the only difference we could detect between the two cell types was a somewhat faster loss of mitotic arrest in cds1Δ cells compared to wild-type. the cds1Δ mutation had no detectable effect either on the degree of re-replication or on which regions were preferentially amplified .

cds <dig> is important for replication fork stability and processivity when replication forks are hindered by dna damage or starvation for dntps during normal s phase. since re-replication presumably takes place under conditions that are not optimal for replication, we initially suspected that cds <dig> might prove important for fork processivity or stability during re-replication. however, this expectation appears to have been incorrect . the fact that both the patterns and extents of re-replication were indistinguishable between cds1Δ and wild-type cells suggests that cds <dig> played no unique role in replication fork stability or processivity during re-replication and suggests that the cds1-dependent replication checkpoint may not be induced, or may be induced only slightly, during re-replication in fission yeast cells.

if re-replication is initiated during a 'g2-like' state of the cells, then absence of the replication checkpoint should be expected, since the mrc <dig> protein – an essential mediator of the replication checkpoint – is cell-cycle regulated and is abundant only during s phase  <cit> . the idea that cdc18*-driven re-replication is initiated during a g2-like state is also consistent with the finding that cdc18*-driven re-replication in fission yeast more closely resembles re-replication in g2/m arrested budding yeast than re-replication initiated in s-phase in budding yeast.

damage at replication forks during re-replication
the absence of a robust replication checkpoint response to stabilize replication forks during re-replication may be partially or completely responsible for the re-replication-induced dna damage that activates the damage checkpoint. operation of the replication checkpoint during normal, unperturbed s phase is essential to prevent the accumulation of damaged dna . it seems likely, therefore, that – in the absence of fork stabilization by the replication checkpoint – damage would also accumulate during re-replication. an additional phenomenon that may contribute to dna damage during re-replication is the likely collisions of faster forks with slower forks traveling in the same direction .

consequences of absence of the dna damage checkpoint  during re-replication
the patterns of re-replication in rad3Δ cells were largely similar to those in wild-type and cds1Δ cells . however, some differences were evident , including greater amplifications of sequences at centromeres, the mating-type locus, and the telomeres of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  these regions have in common the fact that they are heterochromatic. the common response of all the major heterochromatic regions  to the rad3Δ mutation after inducing dna re-replication is somewhat surprising, since during normal s phase the telomeres, which replicate late and are checkpoint-regulated, behave very differently from the centromeres and mating type locus, which replicate early and are not checkpoint-regulated  <cit> . in future studies, it will be interesting to elucidate the mechanisms by which the rad <dig> protein suppresses over-replication of these heterochromatic regions during cdc18*-induced re-replication. futures studies should also shed light on the mechanisms leading to different timing and checkpoint-response behaviors for telomeres  and centromeres and the mating-type locus  during normal replication.

the rad3Δ mutation increased not only the amount of amplification but also the sizes of the amplified regions at telomeres, from 50– <dig> kb in wild-type and cds1Δ cells to more than  <dig> kb in rad3Δ cells . it is known that rad <dig> but not cds <dig> is important for heterochromatin formation in sub-telomeric regions as measured by gene silencing  <cit> . therefore it is tempting to speculate that telomere-associated effects are due to a rad3-specific function directly affecting the chromosomes rather than being an indirect effect of the loss of cell cycle control in rad3Δ cells. one caveat is that telomeric heterochromatin normally extends no further than about  <dig> kb into the sequenced regions at the ends of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . this is smaller than the region amplified in any of the three strains. it is possible that re-replication forks initiated within telomeric heterochromatin may extend into centromere-proximal non-heterochromatic regions.

telomeric amplification as a possible marker for re-replication
telomeric regional amplification is the clearest similarity between re-replication in fission and budding yeasts. there are extensive similarities between the sub-telomeric regions of these two evolutionarily distant yeast species. the telomeres are localized near the nuclear envelope, they are transcriptionally silenced, they are late-replicating, replication is checkpoint responsive, and these regions are preferentially amplified during re-replication . in both yeasts, the size of the specifically-amplified region is ~ <dig> kb. in both yeasts, this amplification zone is followed by a region of under-replication, suggesting the possible presence of some type of barrier or transition zone, with possible biological significance. that the distinct pattern of re-replication adjacent to telomeres is conserved between the highly diverged fission and budding yeasts suggests that preferential amplification may be a basic feature of re-replication near telomeres and therefore may also occur in metazoans.

CONCLUSIONS
here we have presented the results of the first microarray analysis in fission yeast of re-replication induced by over-expression of the initiation protein, cdc18*, a mutant cdc <dig> lacking n-terminal cdk phosphorylation sites. this is also the first microarray analysis in any organism to compare re-replication in wild-type cells with re-replication in checkpoint-mutant cells.

wild-type and checkpoint-mutant cells re-replicated dna throughout their genomes, but the extents of re-replication varied somewhat, with the result that broad regions of hundreds of kilobases were relatively over-re-replicated or under-re-replicated by approximately two-fold or less. the locations of these broad regions did not correspond to the locations of origins that fired efficiently during normal s phase.

there were no significant differences in the patterns or extents of re-replication between wild-type cells and cells deleted for cds <dig>  a downstream checkpoint kinase that is essential for the replication checkpoint. this observation suggested that the replication checkpoint might not function during re-replication under our experimental conditions  – consistent with the possibility that re-replication under our experimental conditions took place primarily during g <dig> phase, when the replication checkpoint is known to be inoperative.

similar to re-replicating cells lacking cds <dig>  re-replicating cells lacking rad <dig>  accumulated broad regions that were relatively over-re-replicated or under-re-replicated and strongly resembled the patterns observed in wild-type and cds1Δ cells. in contrast to wild-type and cds1Δ cells, rad3Δ cells attempted mitotic division after induction of re-replication. as a result, the small differences that we noted between the rad3Δ strain and our other strains may reflect rad3-specific functions directly affecting re-replication or may be the result of mitotic divisions and cell cycle progression.

in wild-type and cds1Δ cells, the telomeres of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> were highly amplified, and the amplification spread away from the telomere for ~50– <dig> kb. the dna from ~ <dig> to ~ <dig> kb from the telomere tended to be under-amplified, suggesting the possible presence of a re-replication barrier in this region. this pattern  is very similar to the pattern seen in the distantly related budding yeast  <cit> , suggesting that the same pattern may be conserved in other eukaryotic organisms.

since several different genetic alterations, each of which leads to excess activity of the initiation proteins cdt <dig> and/or cdc <dig>  can induce re-replication in mammalian cells  <cit> , it is likely that induction of re-replication is one of the genome-destabilizing processes that can lead to cancer. this potential relationship to cancer adds to the inherent importance and interest of studies of re-replication in eukaryotic model organisms such as the yeasts.
