BACKGROUND
the next-generation sequencing  technologies are being extensively used for genome-wide genetic marker development through rna-seq, reduced-representation sequencing, restriction-site-associated dna sequencing  and low-coverage genotyping  <cit> . availability of abundant markers will facilitate association mapping, marker aided selection , and fine mapping of regions of interest for circumventing the problem of linkage drag during introgressions and for map based cloning.

ngs technologies have also contributed to completion of reference genome sequences of many important crops  <cit> . availability of reference genomes will facilitate characterization of variability within a crop and its wild relatives by high throughput re-sequencing. in the family brassicaceae, model species arabidopsis thaliana was sequenced by the sanger method using aligned overlapping bacs  <cit> . using ngs technologies, a large number of ecotypes have been sequenced in a much shorter span of time  <cit> . eventually  <dig> ecotypes will be sequenced.

the first crop species sequenced from brassicaceae is brassica rapa   <cit> . the assembled sequence of  <dig>  mb covers more than 98% of the gene space. sequencing was carried out using illumina ga ii technology. sequence data was integrated with bac-end sequences obtained through the sanger sequencing method. sequencing work was carried out on line chiifu, a leafy vegetable type of b. rapa belonging to ssp. pekinensis. the genome sequence of chiifu is available on brad, a genomic database created for b. rapa and other brassica species  <cit> .

genus brassica contains some of the most important vegetable and oleiferous crops of the world. the relationship of the six crop species namely, b. rapa , b. nigra , b. oleracea , b. juncea , b. napus , b. carinata  was first described by u  <cit>  and later confirmed by others using molecular markers  <cit> . crop brassicas display a range of morphotypes, which include vegetable types where root, leaves, stems and inflorescence have been modified for human consumption, oilseed types and condiment types, all selected under domestication  <cit> . three of the species namely b. juncea, b. napus and b. carinata are recent allopolyploids with the full chromosome compliment of the two parental genomes. the three diploids are paleohexaploids with extensive chromosomal rearrangements, gene subfunctionalization and loss  <cit> . comparative genomic studies have shown that the gene blocks identified in a. lyrata and a. thaliana are represented at least three times in b. rapa, although every gene in a block is not necessarily represented by three paralogs  <cit> .

b. rapa as a species shows enormous morphological variability, containing both vegetable types and oilseed types, and has extensive geographical distribution  <cit> . different morphotypes have been classified under subspecies . there is however, no consensus on the relationship of different types  <cit> . a recent classification has recognised  <dig> ssp. in b. rapa <cit> . the most extensive study to date on variability within b. rapa, conducted on  <dig> accessions with aflp markers, has shown that oleiferous types of a region are closer to the vegetable types of that region rather than to the oleiferous types of the other regions, thereby implying independent domestication of the oleiferous types in many regions  <cit> .

in the present study we have carried out rna-seq of three different oleiferous lines of b. rapa namely, yspb- <dig> and tetra , candle  and a vegetable type line chiifu using illumina ga ii technology to find out if sufficient numbers of snps are available for genome-wide mapping and for fine mapping in specific regions of the genome. yspb- <dig> has a typical bilocular ovary and tetra is an interesting variant in the yellow sarson group as it has a tetralocular ovary. the most probable region of origin of the yellow sarson lines is eastern india. these lines are extensively grown in this region. candle is an oilseed line of european origin. therefore, the study includes two closely related oleiferous lines , which are distant from the oleiferous line candle. all the three lines are divergent from the leafy vegetable type line chiifu that has been sequenced recently.

rna-seq can provide the most informative ssrs and snps for gene synteny based comparative genomics  <cit>  and association mapping. a number of programs have been developed for snp identification from the ngs data  <cit> . marking snps in the single-copy genes has been worked out reasonably well. however, in paleoploid species like b. rapa we require snps not only for marking allelic variation but also for marking the paralogs as has been the case for more recent allopolyploid species like wheat or b. napus <cit> .

we report that a sufficient number of snps are available in the b. rapa single-copy genes for genome-wide mapping and in the paralogs to mark both the allelic differences and paralog specific differences to saturate a specific region with unique marker probes. this strategy for genome-wide mapping and specific-region fine mapping has been tested using a f7-ril population of a chiifu x tetra cross using kaspar oligo technology  <cit> . a total of  <dig> snps have been mapped on the  <dig> linkage groups of b. rapa and  <dig> snps have been mapped in a region of lg a <dig>  which we have recently shown to contain the tet-o locus that encodes the trait - tetralocular ovary .

RESULTS
plant material and sequencing
four brassica rapa lines – yspb- <dig> and tetralocular , candle  and chiifu  were used for rna sequencing. inflorescence, with all the unopened flower buds, along with a few small leaves was used for rna extraction. this amalgam of organs represents most of the aerial tissues of a brassica plant. paired end cdna libraries, used for sequencing, were prepared from the poly-a containing rna and sequenced as 2x <dig> nt reads on the illumina gaiix sequencer.

sequencing samples of tetra, yspb- <dig> and candle were run in two lanes of the flow cell for sequencing whereas chiifu sample was run in only one lane. as information on more than 98% of the gene space is available for chiifu and has been organized as cds in the brad database  <cit> , the limited chiifu transcriptome sequencing was carried out to check the overall quality of the assembly of the raw sequencing data obtained in this study.

data filtering and de-novo assembly of the transcriptome
paired end sequencing of transcriptome generated  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> sequence reads for chiifu, tetralocular, yspb- <dig> and candle, respectively , the lowest being for chiifu for which the data was obtained from single lane. after filtering low-quality and single-end reads, assembly of the cleaned reads was carried out using the velvet de-novo assembly program  <cit>  with default settings except that the minimum contig length was set at 100 bp as this length would be useful for designing oligos for snp analysis. reads were assembled for different k-mer values  and the obtained data were analyzed for the total number of contigs, percentage of reads assembled, n <dig> values and the average contig length. best assembly was found at k-mer value of  <dig> in case of chiifu, tetra and candle and at k-mer value of  <dig> in case of yspb- <dig> . the number of contigs obtained for the four b. rapa lines ranged from  <dig>  for tetra to  <dig>  for candle . approximately 61– <dig> percent of the reads could be assembled into contigs with n <dig> values ranging from  <dig> to 1094 bp. the maximum contig size obtained for chiifu was 8956 bp whereas for the other three lines it was more than 10 kb. the mean depth of the line specific assemblies was found to be in the range  <dig>  to  <dig> .

sequence comparison of yspb- <dig>  tetra and candle with chiifu
we compared the chiifu transcriptome sequence obtained in this study with the chiifu gene models described in the brad database  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  out of  <dig>  contigs obtained in this study could be aligned with the cds sequences reported in the brad database using the parameter of minimum 96% identity, indicating quality assembly of the raw reads in this study. however, the assembled contigs of chiifu and the three oleiferous type lines were predominantly partial sequences . therefore, in the rest of the study the contigs obtained from the three oleiferous lines – ysbp- <dig>  tetra and candle were compared with the more detailed full-length cds  available for the line chiifu in the brad database.

assembled sequences of each of the three oleiferous lines showing ≥ 80% sequence identity in ≥ 100 bp sequence stretch with any of the predicted gene models of chiifu were considered to be homologous sequences. all the contigs showing identity with a chiifu gene model as per the criteria described above were considered to be a part of the gene model and collectively referred to as a homolog. around 90% contigs of tetra,  <dig> % contigs of yspb- <dig> and  <dig> % contigs of candle matched with one or the other gene model of chiifu listed in the brad database. the brad database lists  <dig>  single-copy gene models for chiifu in the syntenic paralog data . we could identify  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  homologs in the lines tetra, yspb- <dig> and candle, respectively . homologs have been grouped-‘chiifu vs yspb-24’, ‘chiifu vs tetra’ and ‘chiifu vs. candle’ and these have been described in the additional file  <dig>  hitherto, gene models and their rna-seq based homologs will be referred to as genes.

*from brad database. genes with tandem repeats were counted as one.

ssr identification
the misa program  <cit>  was used to identify ssrs in the chiifu gene models available in the brad database and in the homolog-contigs of the three oleiferous lines. the minimum cut off for the identification of mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide ssrs was set at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> repeats, respectively. ssrs were found in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes of chiifu and in their homologs in tetra, yspb- <dig> and candle, respectively. mono-, bi- and tri-nucleotide motifs were found to be the most abundant in the three different lines . we have recorded more mono- and di- ssrs in the contigs of candle, yspb- <dig> and tetra as compared to the ssrs present in the gene models described in the brad database for chiifu. this could be due to the presence of utr sequences in the rna-seq data while the cds in brad database contains only those sequences that are translated into a protein. when different lines were compared in silico for the identification of polymorphic ssrs using the stringent criteria of complete identity in 50 bp flanks on either side of the repeat motif, most of the ssrs were found to be monomorphic. the maximum number of polymorphic ssrs  were found between candle and yspb- <dig> and the minimum number of polymorphic ssrs  were identified between tetra and yspb- <dig>  the number of polymorphic ssrs identified between all the four lines in various combinations is shown in figure  <dig> 

* sequences analysed were taken from the brad- brapa_cds dataset.

identification of snps between different lines of b. rapa
two different programs maq  <cit>  and mummer  <cit>  were used separately to identify the single nucleotide variations between different lines of b. rapa. for the maq based snp identification between chiifu and the other three lines, the chiifu cds sequence was taken as the reference and the short reads of each of the three oleiferous lines  were assembled independently on the reference. the snps thus obtained were filtered using snpfilter script and snps with less than read depth of  <dig> and a quality score of less than  <dig> were discarded. this yielded  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps for ‘chiifu vs. tetra’, ‘chiifu vs. yspb-24’ and ‘chiifu vs. candle’, respectively . the identified snps were sorted based on whether these were present in single-copy genes, or in genes with two or three paralogs.

when homologs of different b. rapa lines  were analysed using the mummer tool,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps were identified between ‘chiifu and tetra’, ‘chiifu and yspb-24’ and ‘chiifu and candle’, respectively . these were further categorized on the basis of their being present in single-copy genes, or in genes with two or three paralogs.

for the identification of snps between lines other than chiifu, homologs were compared in pair wise combinations of ‘tetra vs. yspb-24’, ‘tetra vs. candle’ and ‘yspb- <dig> vs. candle’ using both maq  and mummer programs . very high snp frequencies were found for candle vs. the two yellow sarson lines. the least amount of polymorphism  was recorded between tetra and yspb- <dig>  the two closely related lines.

for the purpose of genome-wide mapping studies, one snp is enough for marking a gene. we, therefore, carried out pair-wise analysis of snps in single-copy genes and in genes with two or three paralogs of all the four lines . except for ‘yspb- <dig> vs. tetra’ all others comparisons showed that 60-70% of the single-copy genes contained at least one snp . for the two closely related lines yspb- <dig> and tetra, only  <dig>  homologs could be identified with at least a single snp - marking 14% of the single-copy genes,  <dig> % of the two-gene paralogs and  <dig> % of the three-gene paralogs. this number is sufficient for genome-wide linkage analysis but may turn out to be insufficient for fine mapping in a specific region.

in general, the number of snps recoded when the three oleiferous lines were compared with each other was lesser than the number recorded when the assembled contigs were compared with the full-length chiifu cds sequences available in the brad database . as the contigs generated through velvet assembly in the study were partial sequences, increasing the coverage could provide more snps for fine mapping.

marker development from the identified snps
a survey of the brad database showed that 42% of the gene models have been reported as single-copy genes and these are well distributed throughout the b. rapa genome . developing markers from the single-copy genes for genome-wide linkage analysis was therefore considered to be the ideal strategy.

we used chiifu vs. tetra polymorphism data for snp-marker development as these could be tested on a f7-ril population of chiifu x tetra developed in our laboratory. snps were identified using the following criteria

•snps should be surrounded with a conserved flanking region of ≥50 bp on both sides. this length of sequences would allow flexibility in positioning the oligos for amplification.

•the region of 101 bp, containing the variable base at the middle, should not have any exon-intron junctions.

•read-depth of each of the identified snps should be ≥ <dig> 

a total of  <dig>  single-copy genes that showed ≥ 90% sequence identity between chiifu and tetra were compared for snps. applying the first criteria of 50 bp conserved sequences around the snp, the number of useful contigs was reduced to  <dig> . the number got reduced to  <dig>  when sequences containing the intron/exon junctions were removed. further application of the read-depth criteria reduced the number of contigs to  <dig> , which could be used for marker development. to test our selection criteria for snp marking, a set of  <dig> sequences, all representing single-copy genes that are well distributed throughout the genome were selected for developing snp assays.

for specific-region mapping, the region around the tet-o locus was targeted. this locus has been earlier mapped  on lg <dig>  in a region that contains the s and i blocks of this linkage group. sixty genes from this area were selected for developing snp markers of which  <dig> were single-copy genes and  <dig> had two or three paralogs present in the genome. for such multi-copy genes, the paralogs were aligned and both the allele-specific snp and paralog-specific variations  were marked. allele specific snps were selected wherein the 50 bp on either side of the snp had some paralog specific variations , so that locus specific primers could be designed for marking the specific paralog of interest.

oligos for snp genotyping were synthesized by kaspar technology  using fret quencher oligos competitor allele specific arrays. a total of  <dig> snp based markers were developed between chiifu and tetra lines. the sequence of the marker oligos are provided in additional file  <dig> 

linkage mapping in chiifu x tetra f <dig> ril population
snp marker assays were tested on a chiifu x tetra f7-ril population of  <dig> individuals. out of  <dig> snps selected from well-dispersed genes, successful assays could be obtained with  <dig> snps using kaspar genotyping technology. twelve of the markers showed significant segregation distortion and four were found to be monomorphic. a total of  <dig> markers including  <dig> snp markers generated in this study,  <dig> intron polymorphism  markers,  <dig> ssr markers and one morphological marker  were mapped onto the  <dig> linkage groups corresponding to the haploid chromosome number of b. rapa . the assignment of names to the linkage groups was based on the earlier mapping work  <cit> . the map covered a total genetic length of  <dig>  centimorgans . the markers were distributed over  <dig> intervals and the distance among consecutive markers ranged from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm with an average distance of  <dig>  cm. the use of well-dispersed snp markers allowed excellent general coverage of the linkage groups. the number of markers varied from  <dig>  to a maximum of  <dig>  snp markers. a linkage map based predominantly on the snp markers is given in figure  <dig> 

# the total numbers of markers includes one morphological marker tet-o.

we further tested the use of snp markers for fine mapping of a specific-region containing the locus tet-o. of the  <dig> snp markers developed for fine mapping in the region containing the tet-o locus,  <dig> could be successfully mapped with a mean marker interval of  <dig>  cm. all the  <dig> markers designed for the genes with paralogs, marking both the snp and psv information for allele and paralog discrimination could be mapped without any ambiguity. the detailed map of the region containing the tet-o locus is shown in figure  <dig> 

we have earlier developed a linkage map of three different mapping populations in b. rapa – chiifu x tetra ril-f <dig>  chiifu x tetra f <dig> and chiifu x yspb-24 f <dig> using ip  and ssr makers . these maps have now been integrated with the snp map. a comparison of the features of the four parental maps, i.e. ctf <dig>  ctf <dig>  cyf <dig> and ctf <dig> is given in additional file  <dig>  ip and ssr markers genotyped on ctf <dig> in this study have been mapped previously in all these three mapping populations  and these were used as anchor markers for developing the integrated map.

the integrated map has a total of  <dig>  markers  and a morphological marker ‘tet-o’. the features of the integrated map have been described in additional file  <dig>  the total genetic length spanned by the  <dig> linkage groups of the integrated map was  <dig>  cm. the new integrated map is shown in additional file  <dig> 

discussion
although ngs technologies can be used in a variety of ways for mapping, we have opted in this study to use them for testing whether rna-seq could provide adequate genic ssrs and snps for both genome-wide linkage analysis and for fine mapping of a specific region. our results show that the number of polymorphic genic ssrs is rather limited, but abundant snps are available between the distantly related  lines. the extent of polymorphism is low between the two closely related lines, yspb- <dig> and tetra. in general, the numbers of snps available are adequate both for genome-wide mapping and specific-region fine mapping.

a number of techniques are available for marking snps  <cit> . these have been broadly classified as allele specific hybridization, allele-specific single-base extension and allele specific enzymatic cleavage. different methods have been developed for detection of allele specific products and a number of technology platforms have been developed for allele based sequence determination. all the technologies have been used in one or the other study of snp based mapping in plants. we chose kaspar technology as it seems to be the most appropriate technology for the most frequently encountered mapping situations in crop genetics –  relatively small populations and a reasonable number of markers for genome-wide linkage mapping and  large populations and a small number of markers for specific-region fine mapping. markers for  <dig> snps were developed and  <dig> could be successfully mapped. the technology also allows development of snp markers that can differentiate paralogs and allelic differences in one reaction.

considerable difficulty has been encountered in marking allelic snps in allotetraploid species like triticum aestivum   <cit> , gossypium hirsutum   <cit>  and b. napus   <cit>  due to the presence of homeologous chromosomes  <cit> . b. rapa, in contrast to the three species mentioned above, is an ancient paleoploid with three genomes that have gone through extensive gene fractionation and chromosomal rearrangements. at the genomic level there has been extensive gene loss, leading to many genes being present as single-copy genes besides some having two or three paralogs  <cit> .

the data available for chiifu in the brad cds database and ngs based rna-seq carried out in this study show that a very large proportion of genes present in b. rapa  exist as single-copy genes and the nucleotide polymorphism that exists between the single-copy genes of various lines is sufficient for genome-wide as well as specific-region fine mapping. sufficient nucleotide level polymorphism also exists between the paralogs to mark these through psvs. in our study, > 92% of identified snps could be converted to successful assays using the kaspar technology. our success with kaspar markers is higher than what has been reported in wheat using this technology  <cit> . the possible reasons for this could be –  a reference genome is available in b. rapa,  the frequency of single-copy genes in the genome is very high and  more stringent criteria were used in this study for developing snp detection assays.

use of molecular markers for genetic mapping in b. rapa began with an extensive use of rflp markers  <cit> . use of aflp and srap markers provided more extensive marker densities  <cit> . these markers, though abundant, are anonymous and do not provide any information on genomic synteny and therefore, are difficult to use for fine-mapping. markers obtained from the gene space of a species, are most informative. est-cdna probes  <cit> , genic ssrs  <cit> , intron polymorphism  markers  <cit>  and indels   <cit> , have all been successfully used for comparative mapping and studying genomic synteny amongst the brassica species belonging to the u’s triangle  <cit> .

the large number of snps available in b. rapa will allow more involved genome-wide linkage mapping and also association studies. a core set of  <dig> b. rapa lines has been identified and used in a genome wide association study using predominately aflp markers  <cit> . it should be possible to use snps in future genome-wide association studies. however, we expect that major emphasis in brassica species will be on mapping specific traits like disease  <cit>  and pest resistance and qtl for yield  <cit>  through the use of populations derived from biparental crosses. this is evident from extensive work that has been carried out on mapping of such traits using biparental crosses. precise introgressions while avoiding linkage drag, particularly when unadapted germplasm is used, is going to be the key to improvement of a large number of vegetable and oleiferous crops available within the brassica species belonging to the u’s triangle. the ready availability of snps for both background selection  and precise introgression  will help in introduction from unadapted to adapted germplasm and from the diploid species to allotetraploid species. specific-area marking and mapping of genes, as has been shown in this study for the region containing the tet-o locus, will also be useful for map based cloning.

methods
plant material, rna extraction and library preparation
the four brassica rapa lines - yspb- <dig>  tetralocular  candle , chiifu  used for transcriptome analysis were grown in the field during the mustard growing season . tissues for rna isolation were taken from the field-grown plants at the time of flowering.

inflorescence with unopened flower buds along with a few small leaves, was used for rna extraction. harvested tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. total rna was isolated using total rna spectrum kit , following the manufacturer’s instructions. contaminating dna was removed by dnase treatment . rna was further purified by treatment  with acidic phenol: chloroform . rna was quantified using nanodrop nd <dig> spectrophotometer . integrity of the obtained rna samples was checked on agilent  <dig> bio analyzer. rna samples with rin value ≥  <dig> were used for further experiments.

paired end cdna libraries, used for sequencing, were prepared from 20 μg of total rna using predominantly the reagents available in the mrna-seq sample preparation kit . mrna was isolated from the total rna with magnetic oligo  beads. purified mrna was fragmented by treatment with divalent cations for 5 min . the obtained mrna fragments were transcribed into first strand cdna using superscript ii reverse transcriptase , followed by second-strand cdna synthesis using dna polymerase and rnaseh. double stranded cdna molecules were purified by a qiaquick pcr purification kit . end repair of the double-stranded cdna was carried out using t <dig> dna polymerase, the klenow dna polymerase and t <dig> polynucleotide kinase. dna was purified again using a qiaquick pcr purification kit. this was followed by a single ‘a’ base addition at the 3’ end of the double stranded cdna molecules using klenow 3’ to 5’ exo-polymerase followed by purification of modified cdna molecules using a minelute pcr purification kit . sequencing adaptors were ligated to the ‘a’ tailed fragments using t <dig> ligase. adaptor ligated cdna fragments were separated on 2% agarose gel and fragments ranging in size from 200–250 bp were excised from the gel and purified using a qiaquick gel extraction kit. pcr was performed for 15 cycles from the purified dna molecules using the adaptor specific primers  and the amplified fragments were purified using a qiaquick pcr purification kit. the size and quantity of the obtained enriched cdna libraries was checked on an agilent  <dig> bio analyzer. libraries with single discrete band of 200–250 bp were selected for sequencing reactions. the libraries were sequenced as  <dig> x  <dig> nt paired end reads on the genome analyzer iix instrument .

data filtering and de-novo assembly of the transcriptome
data obtained from the sequencer were processed for image deconvolution and quality value calculation of each base using the casava package . quality check was done using fastx-toolkit  <cit> . reads with more than 30% bases having a phred quality score <  <dig> were removed from the analysis using fastq_quality_filter . thirty-one bases of the tail region, which were found to have low phred score, were removed from the obtained sequences using fastx-quality_trimmer .

the assembly of the filtered reads was done using velvet de-novo assembly program with the velvetg main parameters: -ins_length_sd  <dig> -ins_length  -read_trkg yes -min_contig_lgth  <dig> -scaffolding yes -alignments yes. obtained contig sequences are available on request.

snp marker development
for marker development snps were mined from the est contigs of tetra generated in this study and the reference gene model sequence data of chiifu available in the brad database. for identifying snps in the single-copy genes, the reference sequence dataset of  <dig>  single-copy gene sequences was compared against corresponding tetra contigs identified as single-copy genes. sequences showing ≥ 90% homology were compared for snps using the mummer software. after removing sequences with insertions/deletions, sequences with snps and 50 bp conserved flanking sequence on both sides of the snp were excised from the contigs using custom perl scripts. for identifying allele specific snps in genes with two/three paralogs, the tetra contigs were compared against the reference sequence of chiifu by conducting a blast search  <cit> . the paralogs were separated based on the homology and paralog specific variations . the allelic variations were marked using custom perl scripts and snps with 50 bp on each side of snp were excised as before. psv containing sequences were selected to design paralog specific primers. as the snps were identified using est sequences, blast search was conducted with all the excised 101 bp sequences containing snps against the b. rapa genome sequences of chiifu available in the brad database  to identify intron/exon junctions. selected snps showing the presence of such boundaries in the flanking regions were discarded, as the oligo designing at such positions would result in assay failure.

the cut-off read depth for the identified snp was set at ≥  <dig>  for this, a velvet assembly generated .afg file was converted to .ace file and further pileup file was generated using samtools  <cit> . the depth of each of the base  was calculated using custom perl scripts.

snp genotyping and construction of linkage map
for validation and mapping of snps, kbioscience kaspar assay  <cit>  was used. the primer design and assay development was undertaken by kbiosciences  <cit> . the id and features of identified putative snps along with 100 bp sequences are provided in the additional file  <dig> 

for genotyping the snps markers, a recombinant inbred line  population of  <dig> individuals in the f <dig> generation derived from a cross between the leafy vegetable type line chiifu and the oleiferous line tetra was used. from the already developed map of b. rapa using f <dig> -ril population of chiifu and tetra in our lab , randomly selected  <dig> ip and  <dig> ssr markers, well dispersed on all the  <dig> linkage groups were also genotyped on f7-rils to develop a skeleton map. pcr reactions and product separation for ip and ssr markers were performed as described earlier  <cit> . linkage groups were established at a lod >  <dig>  with join map  <dig>   <cit>  following the mapping criteria of pradhan et al.  <cit> . the recombination fractions were transformed to map distances with the kosambi function  <cit> . the graphical representation of the linkage groups was generated by map chart  <dig>   <cit> .

for the construction of an integrated map, marker information from three mapping populations ctf <dig> , ctf <dig>  and cyf <dig>   along with the genotyped snp markers was used. recombination fraction data from the ctf <dig>  ctf <dig> and cyf <dig> were merged with the recombination data of ctf <dig> map and heterogeneity tests were performed for pairs of markers common to the four mapping populations. a set of markers from each linkage group was identified on the basis of the order among the component maps  and was used to define a fixed order for the construction of an integrated map. common marker pairs that differed significantly  in the recombination frequencies were excluded from mapping. an integrated map was generated by join map  <dig>  with the combine groups for a map integration function using the regression mapping algorithm.

CONCLUSIONS
rna-seq of three agronomically interesting oleiferous lines of b. rapa using paired end sequencing provided a large number of snps for both genome-wide mapping and for fine mapping in specific areas of the genome. high confidence snps in homologs were selected for kaspar based genetic marker development by three-step selection criteria. high frequency  of markers could be mapped successfully in the b. rapa genome. kaspar technology can be effectively used for marking allelic snps and psvs for marking paralogs in b. rapa lines, and can be used for marking genes with multiple paralogs in any genome. also, availability of large number of snps will allow fine mapping of regions of interest.
