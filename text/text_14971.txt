BACKGROUND
copy number variations , or copy number polymorphisms , are forms of structural variation  that are alterations in dna resulting in the cell having an abnormal number of copies of one or more segments of dna. a cnv is a dna segment ranging from  <dig> kb to  <dig> mb that has been deleted, inserted, or duplicated, on certain chromosomes  <cit> . in particular, segmental duplications  were demonstrated to be one of the major catalysts and hotspots for cnv formation  <cit> . a cnv was described as early as  <dig>  with the duplication of the bar gene in drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . recently, many studies have discovered cnvs in humans  <cit> , chimpanzee  <cit> , dog  <cit> , cattle  <cit> , rat  <cit> , mice  <cit> , drosophila  <cit> , yeast  <cit> , e. coli  <cit> , and maize  <cit> . cnvs can be detected using cytogenetic techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization, array-based comparative genomic hybridization, and snp genotyping arrays. recent advances in dna sequencing technologies have further enabled the identification of cnvs by next-generation sequencing  <cit> .

cnvs can create new genes, change gene dosage, reshape gene structures, and modify elements regulating gene expression  <cit> . thus, cnvs are considered likely major sources of genetic variation, and may influence phenotypic variation and gene expression. some human cnvs have been linked with susceptibility or resistance to disease. a higher ccl3l <dig> copy number, for example, can reduce risk of hiv/aids infection  <cit> , and a lower fcgr <dig> copy number appears to contribute to increased susceptibility to glomerulonephritis  <cit> . cnvs also have an impact on fitness and gene expression. cnvs detected among  <dig> female isolines of drosophila have been subjected to purifying selection  <cit> . in addition, a dramatic fruit size change due to a cnv with an insertion of 6- <dig> kb that affected gene regulation, was described during tomato breeding  <cit> . it was recently demonstrated that most cnvs in humans are in linkage disequilibrium  with single nucleotide polymorphisms ; and that ld decay of the two happens at similar rates  <cit> . cnvs were confirmed to capture about 18% of the variation in gene expression, with little overlap with the variation captured by snps  <cit> . thus, cnvs can be developed as a type of molecular marker for molecular identification.

rice , comprises two subspecies, indica and japonica. it is one of the most important food crops in the world, and a model plant for genomic studies of monocots. rice genomes exhibit relatively high levels of snps and indels  <cit> . sequence comparisons between the nipponbare  and  <dig>  genomes have shown high levels of polymorphisms ranging from one snp/ <dig> bp to one indel/kp  <cit> . these can potentially be exploited as molecular markers between these divergent subspecies. however, there are few studies of structural variation within the rice genome. recent study of many subclones within chromosome  <dig> of the bac libraries of nipponbare and guang-lu-ai  <dig> , has documented that many genes vary in copy number  <cit> . with the completion of rice genome sequencing projects and advances in microarray technologies, comprehensive oligonucleotide microarrays are now being used to discover genetic polymorphisms. array-based comparative genomic hybridization  has the advantages of high resolution and high-throughput genome-wide screening of genomic imbalances, and has been used in rice to detect single-feature polymorphisms  <cit> , and structural variations created by mutagenesis  <cit> .

we used high-density oligonucleotide acgh  to investigate the number of cnvs between nipponbare and guang-lu-ai  <dig> genomes. we found high levels of cnvs, some representing large inserted/deleted regions. in addition, several dna segments, often including genic sequences, were identified as present in the nipponbare genome but absent from the guang-lu-ai  <dig> genome. ours is the first comprehensive map of cnvs in the rice genome; providing an important resource for understanding the nature of variation among different rice varieties.

RESULTS
cnv detection using acgh
to investigate the reproducibility of cnv detection using acgh, we performed acgh on three independent samples of nipponbare and guang-lu-ai  <dig> . in comparing hybridization results we decided that most detected cnvs may be accurate, even though some were not present in all replications. using less stringent criteria, in which the log <dig> of the signal ratio between the two genomes was ±  <dig> , we detected a total of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  cnvs respectively in three replications of nipponbare and guang-lu-ai 4; of which  <dig>  were detected in all three replications. however, using stringent criteria in which the log <dig>  was ±  <dig> , three comparisons of two samples revealed  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cnvs respectively; of which  <dig>  were detected in all three replications . encouraged by this result, we surveyed hybridization signals which had high confidence levels and identified  <dig> cnvs.

these  <dig> cnvs comprised ~ <dig> %  of the rice genome, similar to the proportion of cnvs in a population of drosophila melanogaster   <cit> , and were distributed along all  <dig> rice chromosomes . we found no significant correlation between the frequencies of cnv occurrence and chromosome length . the highest frequency  was found on chromosome  <dig>  and the lowest frequency  on chromosome  <dig>  this is consistent with a previous study of heterogeneous distribution of cnvs  <cit> . cnv sizes ranged from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb, averaging  <dig>  kb. most cnvs  were found to be small variants , while some  were larger variants  . the largest regions showing copy gain and loss were  <dig>  kb on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  kb on chromosome  <dig> . analysis of the acgh data also revealed a bias towards stronger hybridization signals from the nipponbare genomic dna than from the guang-lu-ai  <dig> genomic dna. this was found in cnvs determined by stringent criteria as well as those determined by less stringent criteria. this reflects the fact that the probes were designed from nipponbare sequences.

pcr analysis
we used  <dig> pcrs to further analyze  <dig> putative cnvs detected by acgh. all pcrs confirmed the existence of insertion/deletion polymorphisms in these regions . more than 90% showed presence/absence variations between nipponbare and guang-lu-ai  <dig>  all the validated cnv regions were defined by a few probes. in a cnv located on chromosome  <dig>  for example, four amplicons spanning those probes of the putative deletions did not amplify from guang-lu-ai  <dig> , indicating that the dna segment was absent from guang-lu-ai  <dig> . in addition, we also identified the allelic versions in  <dig> varieties of the two subspecies, and obtained similar results; more amplification products were present in japonica than in indica . indica and japonica are derived from independent domestication events of an ancestral rice that had already differentiated into two gene pools  <cit> . it seems unlikely that our observed pattern could be generated randomly, but our low number of samples prevents us from confirming strong evidence of subspecific variation in our cnv analysis.

annotation of cnvs
different hybridization signal intensity of a gene across acgh would indicate a gain or loss of a gene copy number during rice evolution. using a stringent selection criterion , we identified  <dig> protein-coding genes that were contracted in guang-lu-ai  <dig>  and only  <dig> genes that were duplicated  . the dominance of gene contraction over duplication was obvious when the acgh selection ratio was relaxed . contracted genes thus greatly outnumbered duplicated ones. the majority of contracted genes are hypothetical proteins, indicating duplication of preexisting genes to augment gene function. among the  <dig> duplicated genes, three encode different enzymes: transposase, reverse transcriptase and terpenoid cyclase. one gene is involved in gibberellin synthesis, i.e. ent-kaurene synthase like- <dig>  xa <dig> is a known bacterial blight resistance gene. duplication also occurred in genes relating to metabolism, such as the gtp-binding signal recognition particle srp <dig>  and the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase e <dig> subunit. as well, two genes were involved in transcription, the rna polymerase iii rpc <dig> family protein and the c2h2-type zinc finger domain-containing protein. many of the contracted genes corresponded to genes that were either the same genes or genes involved in the same biological processes. this was similar for genes involved in disease and defense, such as most of them encode proteins with conserved nucleotide-binding sites  and leucine-rich repeats . in addition, cytochrome p <dig> and concanavalin a-like lectin/glucanase play crucial roles in defending plants from disease.

discussion
using acgh, we have generated the first map of cnvs in the rice genome. after very stringent filtering,  <dig> cnv events were identified between the two rice subspecies cultivars nipponbare and guang-lu-ai  <dig>  this is likely to represent a very conservative estimate of the true number of cnv events in the rice genome. focusing only on the unique sequences in our microarray will have potentially led to an underestimation of the number of cnv events. this is due to the selective omission or reduction of probe density in some cnvs enriched regions that contain segmental duplications and diverse repetitive sequences. in addition, our stringent cnv calling criteria restrained the detection of putative true cnvs. differing probe densities, algorithms and statistical criteria used in the literature, complicate comparisons of rates of cnvs among different organisms  <cit> . our data suggest that smaller cnvs  are much more frequent than larger ones; this is supported by other studies  <cit> . however, using next-generation sequencing techniques would offer advantages over acgh as dna variations and recombination breakpoints would be directly detected  <cit> .

cnv number differs between species. in mammals, the mean number of cnvs per individual has been found to range from  <dig> in macaques  <cit>  to  <dig> in humans  <cit> . in maize, around  <dig> cnvs have been detected between two cultivars   <cit> . we observed many more cnvs between indica and japonica, the main reason for this was that we used subspecific samples. indica and japonica diverged from their o. rufipogon ancestor between  <dig>  and  <dig>  years ago  <cit> , and have richly diversified during the processes of domestication and selection. both phenotypic and molecular studies have confirmed a relatively high level of differentiation between these two subspecies  <cit> , suggesting great variation. this is also indicated by the lower numbers of deleted gene regions  between  <dig> mutants and their wild type ir  <dig> of indica  <cit> . more recently, tiling oligonucleotide microarrays with  <dig> million probes, showed that an average of  <dig>  cnvs comprising  <dig> % of the human genome were validated between two individuals  <cit> . this was also found in a previous study  <cit> , indicating that increased density and improved probe design will help us to better understand the roles of cnvs in organisms.

although the presence and phenotypic effects of cnvs in plants have been little investigated on the genomic level, the nature of cnvs detected in maize suggests that they may have considerable impact on plant phenotypes, including disease responses and heterosis. we detected at least  <dig> genes in our high confidence cnv regions . however, it is likely that more genes are affected. we found that genes in many cnvs were involved in resistance, and that most of these encode proteins with conserved nucleotide-binding sites  and leucine-rich repeats . nbs-lrr genes in plants tend to cluster at the same loci within genomes  <cit> . similarly, both resistance genes and quantitative trait loci  are clustered in the rice genome  <cit> . in addition to its functional and agronomic importance, the nbs-lrr gene family has a structural role within the genome  <cit> .

previous research showed strong evidence that natural selection may shape cnvs, both in their patterns of polymorphism and their distribution within the genome  <cit> . long-term purifying selection has changed quantitative traits, and it is possible that genomic variation in rice supplies source material for the generation of novel alleles. this implies that characterization of rice cnvs is far from perfect, and provides a comprehensive view of the polymorphic phase of cnvs.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that cnvs are able to be detected in rice using array-based comparative genome hybridization. these are likely to be linked with subspecific characteristics and to provide an important resource for understanding variation among different rice varieties.
