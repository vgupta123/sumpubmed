BACKGROUND
the development of an organism entails the precise expression of lineage and tissue-specific gene products in a temporally-regulated manner during embryogenesis. the information for a cell to respond to external signals by differentiating down a particular developmental pathway is 'hardwired' into the regulatory regions surrounding these developmentally regulated genes . these conserved regulatory regions or modules drive spatial gene expression patterns in the forming tissues of the developing organism. changes in the cis-regulatory elements of regulatory modules are hypothesized to be the predominant mechanism behind evolutionary changes in pattern formation  <cit> .

many expression modules have been shown to be functionally conserved in vertebrate species. for example, regulatory regions from several hox genes from fish and chicken are capable of driving some aspects of the spatial expression patterns of the paralogous murine gene in transgenic mice  <cit> . examples of conserved regulatory modules have been shown for the processes of neurogenesis  <cit> , limb morphogenesis  <cit>  and haematopoiesis  <cit> , amongst many other examples.

we, and others, have previously shown that lentiviral vectors can be used to generate transgenic chickens and that cis-regulatory regions incorporated into these vectors will drive ubiquitous or tissue-specific expression in this species  <cit> . in this report we investigate the possibility of utilising rodent regulatory elements to drive transgene expression in skeletal muscle of chickens. to achieve this we investigated the transcriptional activity of the rat mlc regulatory domains in transgenic chickens. this locus encodes two alkali myosin light chains expressed from two promoters that are differentially regulated during development. the mlc <dig> isoform is expressed at embryonic stages of development and in the fast fibres of skeletal muscles of the adult. the mlc <dig> isoform is expressed at fetal stages and in the atria of the mouse heart  <cit> . the construct we used consists of the rat mlc <dig> promoter, which is transcriptionally active in all striated muscle in mouse transgenic models  <cit> , and a downstream rat mlc enhancer which augments skeletal muscle expression and confers expression at embryonic stages of development  <cit> . we show that a putative mlc enhancer is present in the chicken mlc locus. using the rat mlc regulatory elements, we show that these elements support transgene expression in skeletal muscle of chickens. cardiac transgene expression was not detected. these results indicate a functional conservation of the mlc regulatory elements exist between rodents and chickens in the skeletal muscle lineage. this demonstration is significant not only for the use of the chicken as a model organism for studies in developmental biology but also because poultry are an economically important food source.

RESULTS
the mammalian mlc locus consists of two widely separated promoters driving expression of two protein isoforms of the alkali mlc and a downstream enhancer  <cit> . the exon structure of the chicken, rat, mouse, and human myosin light chain 1/ <dig> locus is highly conserved  <cit> . . the rat and mouse mlc enhancer and the mlc <dig> promoters were previously shown to drive robust expression in fast skeletal muscle of transgenic mice  <cit> . cardiac expression was shown to be dependant on the mlc <dig> promoter  <cit> .

examination of the chicken locus at an analogous position for the mlc enhancer enabled us to identify a region of homology shared with human, rat, mouse, and opossum . a closer examination of this region revealed a putative enhancer module containing regulatory elements that closely resemble the core myosin light chain enhancer as defined in mouse, rat and human  <cit> . this core enhancer contains three canonical e boxes  that bind to the myogenic factors, myf- <dig>  mrf <dig>  myod, and myogenin and an a/t rich region containing a sequence matching the consensus binding site of mef <dig>  <cit> . all four regulatory motifs are present in this dna sequence as indicated in fig.  <dig>  these data suggest that the structure of the mlc1/ <dig> locus is highly conserved between mammals and chicken.

generation of a muscle-specific reporter cassette
to define a regulatory module that is sufficient for gene expression in the striated muscle of transgenic chickens, we used the regulatory regions from the rat mlc1/ <dig> locus to drive expression of a lacz reporter gene. these elements were both introduced upstream of the lacz reporter gene in a minimal eiav replication-defective lentiviral vector to create the construct pony-mlz . to test the transcriptional activity of the lentiviral construct in chicken cells, transient transfections of the construct were carried out into primary cultures of embryonic chicken cardiac and skeletal muscle cells and the transfected cells were stained for β-galactosidase activity . an upstream cmvenhancer/promoter regulatory region used for packaging the lentiviral construct was first removed from this plasmid to avoid possible transactivation of the downstream mlc <dig> promoter . a gfp reporter construct was co-transfected to visualise transfection efficiency into these cells . transfections into skeletal muscle primary cultures demonstrated that long myotubular cells stained positive for β-galactosidase whilst surrounding fibroblasts did not . in transfections into cardiac muscle primary cultures, no expression of β-galactosidase was detected . these results indicate that the mlc regulatory module is transcriptionally active in skeletal muscle cells but is not active in cardiac muscle. we went on to test this module in vivo using transgenesis.

generation of transgenic chickens carrying the mlc-lacz transgene
to generate transgenic chickens containing a mlc transgene, a concentrated preparation of pony-mlz replication-defective lentivirus was produced. the virus was injected into the sub-germinal cavity of fertilised eggs at the new-laid egg stage. injected eggs were incubated until hatching using the surrogate shell culture system as described  <cit> . a total of  <dig> chickens were hatched and all were identified as transgenic for the eiav vector by semi-quantitative pcr of dna from blood samples. one cockerel, estimated to have an incidence of 10% transgene integration in the germline by pcr analysis of semen dna, was bred with stock hens and g <dig> transgenic offspring identified. seven g <dig> offspring were produced and genomic dna from these birds analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion and southern blot analysis to determine the number of vector insertions in each bird and the number of different insertion events represented in the g <dig> generation. genomic dna digested with hindiii and sph <dig> generated junction fragments that revealed that all seven birds contained single vector insertions and four independent insertions were present in the g <dig> birds . four g <dig> birds, each carrying a different transgene integrant, were bred to generate g <dig> birds which were analysed in the subsequent experiments.

transgene expression is limited to avian skeletal muscle
to determine the transcriptional profile of the mlc expression module in transgenic chickens, selected tissues from chickens carrying each of the four independent vector insertions were assayed for β-galactosidase protein by elisa . β-galactosidase protein was detected in breast and leg muscle of three transgenic lines . the skeletal muscle expression levels were relatively robust. for example in line  <dig>   <dig> % of the total protein in skeletal muscle was β-galactosidase. non-muscle tissues did not contain β-galactosidase. no β-galactosidase was detected in tissue samples from the fourth transgenic line . it is possible that the integrated vector for this line has acquired a mutation that inactivated the transgene or that it has integrated into a transcriptionally silent site.

bottom: sections from various tissues of the same birds were stained for β-galactosidase activity. a) transgenic breast muscle. b) transgenic leg muscle. c) immunofluorescence of the endogenous mlc <dig> and  <dig> protein d) control breast muscle. e) transgenic atrium. f) transgenic ventricle. staining in skin appears to be in striated muscles associated with feather tracts. scale bars,  <dig>  mm.

unexpectedly, no β-galactosidase was detected in heart atria or ventricles of birds from any of the three expressing lines. in transgenic mice, the mlc <dig> promoter alone drove β-galactosidase expression in cardiac muscle of transgenic mice   <cit> . addition of the mlc enhancer to the transgene construct inhibited expression in cardiac tissues of two out of three transgenic mouse lines. a similar effect was also reported by zammit et al.,  <cit> . the lack of expression in cardiac tissue from the transgenic chickens mimicked the result obtained by transfection experiments into chicken cardiomyocytes and was also similar to the expression patterns observed in transgenic mice for constructs containing the mlc enhancer.

tissues from the transgenic adult birds were stained for β-galactosidase activity to observe the spatial expression pattern in skeletal muscle. non-muscle tissues and cardiac muscle did not stain for β-galactosidase . pectoral muscle of the breast was entirely stained for β-galactosidase. immunofluorescence of chicken pectoral muscle with an antibody to chicken myosin light chain  <dig> and  <dig> revealed extensive expression throughout this tissue . in contrast to the pectoral musculature, staining of leg muscle displayed a cobbled expression pattern. chicken pectoral muscle contains predominantly fast fibre muscle  whereas leg musculature contains both fast and slow muscle fibres   <cit> . this result suggests that the transgene is expressed extensively in the fast fibre tissue of the breast flight muscle and is restricted in expression in leg muscle which contains slow as well as fast muscle fibres.

tissue from the leg muscle was stained for β-galactosidase and an adjacent section immunostained with fast and slow fibre-specific antibodies  <cit> , to demonstrate that the transgene expression is limited to fast fibres. the results shown in fig. 5a and 5b demonstrate that the fibres that stained for β-galactosidase activity were also labelled with the fast fibre marker, f <dig>  conversely, fibres negative for β-galactosidase activity were immuno-positive for the slow fibre marker, s <dig>  this finding is in accordance with results obtained in mouse models, which demonstrated that the mlc1/ <dig> regulatory module conferred expression to fast muscle fibres  <cit> .

to demonstrate that the transgene expression follows that of the endogenous mlc1/ <dig> locus, a tissue section was stained for β-galactosidase and an adjacent section immunostained with an antibody to mlc <dig> and  <dig> isoforms    <cit> . muscle fibres that are negative for β-galactosidase activity are immuno-negative for mlc <dig> and  <dig> indicating that the rat regulatory elements are expressed in a similar fibre type as the endogenous gene.

the mlc module drives early embryonic expression
we next examined the temporal expression pattern of the mlc construct at selected embryonic stages and compared these expression patterns with those of the endogenous locus, to determine if the transgenic construct is accurately developmentally regulated. staining of chicken embryos for β-galactosidase activity revealed that the mlc transgene was expressed in the forming myotome of day  <dig>  chicken embryos . in situ hybridisation with a riboprobe specific for mlc <dig> and  <dig> mrna also revealed that the endogenous chicken locus is transcribed in the chicken myotome at this stage . abundant staining of the cardiac tube was also apparent. an analysis of later stages revealed extensive staining of β-galactosidase activity through the forming muscle masses of day  <dig>  transgenic chicken embryos . these analyses show that the mlc regulatory module is sufficient to drive embryonic expression in skeletal muscles of chicken but not in cardiac tissue. transgenic constructs containing these regulatory elements had previously been shown to be expressed in the myotome of developing transgenic mouse embryos  <cit> . thus, our results indicate a conservation of temporal expression patterns between rodents and chicken.

CONCLUSIONS
these experiments are a further demonstration that the chicken can be used as an alternative model for transgenic analysis of gene regulation and of the use of lentivirus in avian transgenesis. these results indicate that the mlc regulatory module is functionally conserved for fast muscle fibre expression in mammals and birds and is developmentally regulated. regulatory regions in the mlc enhancer are also conserved between mammals and chicken . in contrast, sequences in the mlc <dig> promoter are divergent when compared to the mlc <dig> promoter  <cit> . the gata regulatory element of the rat mlc <dig> promoter, essential for cardiac expression in the rat, is not conserved in the chicken mlc <dig> promoter, yet there is expression from the endogenous mlc1/ <dig> locus in the embryonic chicken heart , suggesting that regulatory modules for avian cardiac expression are divergent from those in mammals.

the construct described here will be useful as an expression module to drive skeletal muscle expression in avian species. this will have applications for the expression of proteins or rnas in avian muscle tissue for studies of muscle differentiation and function. for example, the expression of micrornas targeting genes involved in skeletal muscle myopathy in broiler chickens could be specifically targeted to skeletal muscle using this regulatory module  <cit> . additionally, similarly constructed transgenes will permit the analysis of candidate genes, identified by qtl mapping and expression analyses, implicated in control of muscle mass in chicken lines selected for increased muscle mass  <cit> . inherent difficulties still remain in the generation of transgenic chickens including the long period to sexual maturity  and the difficulties in generating high titre lentivirus for large and complex transgenes.
