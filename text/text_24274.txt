BACKGROUND
the first descriptions of nucleoside diphosphate kinase  activity, that corresponds to the phosphoryl transfer from a nucleoside triphosphate to a nucleoside diphosphate, were made in pigeon breast muscle  <cit>  and yeast  <cit> . sequences encoding for proteins with putative  <cit>  or experimentally validated  <cit>  ndpk activity were subsequently identified. these proteins, originally named ndpk based on their ndpk activity, belong to the nme protein family according to current official gene nomenclature  <cit> . these proteins "expressed in non-metastatic cell", and thus named nme, were also previously known as nm <dig> proteins. in humans, the nme family is composed of ten genes and some of the proteins, but not all, exhibit ndpk activity.

nme genes were first identified in mouse  <cit>  and in the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster  <cit>  in which they drew attention for their surprising implication in tumor metastasis process  <cit>  and in normal fly development  <cit>  respectively. soon, several orthologs of these genes were identified in other organisms ranging from the bacteria escherichia coli  <cit>  to humans  <cit> . they were subsequently studied for their role as tumor metastasis suppressor or enhancer depending on the cancer type. to date, ten genes displaying partial or complete ndpk domains have been identified in humans . proteins of this family were classified into two groups based on sequence characteristics and ndpk activity  <cit> . group i nme proteins  display a particularly well conserved domain and active site, whereas group ii nme proteins  display highly divergent domains and all of them, except nme <dig>  lack ndpk activity  <cit> . in fish and amphibians, proteins of the nme family have been implicated in key developmental processes in the oocyte or embryo  <cit> . however, the nme proteins repertoire remains uncharacterized in almost all non-mammalian vertebrates. in teleost fish, only two nme sequences were reported  <cit> . in non-mammalian species, the picture of the nme family remains fuzzy and the orthology relationships of reported nme proteins with their mammalian counterparts were only partially characterized  <cit> . therefore, the evolutionary process which gave rise to such a complex gene family remains poorly understood and requires a complete characterization that will pave the way for future investigations of the roles of nme proteins in vertebrates.

in the present study, we describe the evolutionary history of the nme gene family in chordates and provide, for the first time, a comprehensive characterization of the nme gene repertoire in vertebrates.

RESULTS
evolutionary history of nme gene family in vertebrates
nucleoside disphosphate  kinase activity is ubiquitously found in organisms from bacteria to humans. in humans, ten nme genes exist that have been separated in two groups based on their amino-acid sequence  <cit> . these two groups originate from a gene duplication of a single ndpk ancestor gene that probably occurred before or around the metazoan radiation  <cit> . as indicated above, the evolutionary history of vertebrate nme proteins has received very little attention as most existing studies focused on mammalian proteins or on specific members of the family  <cit> . some information is however available in cellular slime molds  <cit> , drosophila and c. elegans  <cit> . in contrast, available data in chordates and non-mammalian vertebrate species are extremely limited apart from the report of several nme sequences  <cit> .

a two group classification
the phylogenetic analysis of nme proteins  shows two strongly supported distinct clusters. nme <dig>  nme <dig>  nme <dig>  and nme <dig> belong to the group i cluster while nme <dig>  nme <dig>  nme <dig>  nme <dig> and nme <dig> belong to the group ii cluster. within each group, all nme subtypes are also distinctly separated from each other, with the exception of nme <dig> sequences that are only found in eutherians and appear to be closely related to nme <dig> sequences . the analysis of the domain structure of nme proteins using the ncbi conserved domain database  <cit>  clearly demonstrates the existence of two distinct groups among nme <dig> to  <dig> proteins  that clearly possess distinct domains. proteins of the group i  display a single type ndpk_ <dig> domain while proteins of the group ii  display a single or several ndpk domains of different types, associated or not with extra-domains. for all nme, the sequence structure, including domain nature, length or position in the sequence, as well as the exon-intron structure , is highly conserved between human and zebrafish  proteins. together, our results on exon-intron structure, protein domains, and phylogenetic analysis, clearly indicate that the separation of vertebrate nme <dig> to nme <dig> proteins in two groups that has been proposed in mammals  <cit>  is also valid for all vertebrates.

nme <dig>  the outgroup of the family
nme <dig> protein, previously named x-linked retinitis pigmentosa  <dig> , is the most recently identified member of the nme family and vertebrate nme <dig> proteins form a specific group as shown by the phylogenetic analysis . it is also noteworthy that sequence identities between prochordates and vertebrates range from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, indicating a high divergence between prochordate and vertebrate proteins in comparison to the high sequence identity observed among vertebrates species  . the protein domain analysis reveals that all vertebrate nme <dig> only possess a partial ndpk domain , which is not present in either ciona  or lancelet  nme <dig> proteins . the comparison of the exon-intron structure of the nme <dig> gene between lancelet and vertebrates  clearly shows that the addition of the partial ndpk domain in vertebrates is associated with a different number of exons in the 3' end of the gene. together, these observations suggest that a partial ndpk domain was inserted in the nme <dig> gene before the gnathostome radiation. as the current status of the lamprey genome preliminary assembly did not allow us to identify any nme10-related gene in lamprey we are currently unable to provide a better evaluation of the timing of the insertion of this ndpk fragment into the nme <dig> gene in the vertebrate lineage. in summary, our observations clearly show that nme <dig>  in contrast to all other vertebrate nme proteins, is characterized by a recent incorporation of an ndpk domain. however, because of the gene nomenclature used in mammals  <cit> , we suggest to name this gene nme <dig> in vertebrates. in contrast, the classification of this gene in the group ii is more debatable in the light of its totally different evolutionary history.

nme <dig>  nme <dig>  nme <dig> and nme <dig> originate from duplication events that occurred prior to the chordate radiation
we have been able to identify nme <dig>  nme <dig>  nme <dig>  and nme <dig> proteins in ciona and lancelet as well as in all investigated vertebrate species, with the exception of the lamprey in which nme <dig> and nme <dig> could not be found in the current genome preliminary assembly. while we cannot rule out that nme <dig> and nme <dig> have been lost in lamprey, it is also possible that the preliminary status of the genome assembly and the relatively low sequencing coverage  can explain why we have been unable to identify these genes. it should however be stressed that both domain  and exon-intron structure  of nme <dig>  nme <dig>  nme <dig>  and nme <dig> are particularly well conserved among chordates, with the exception of lancelet nme <dig> gene that displays a very specific exon-intron structure. in addition, nme <dig>  nme <dig>  nme <dig> and nme <dig> proteins exhibit high degree of identity among chordates . in addition, the orthology relationships among species are also clearly supported by the phylogenetic analysis for each protein subtype . together with existing data on the origin of group ii nme proteins  <cit> , our observations indicate that nme <dig>  nme <dig>  nme <dig>  and nme <dig> genes originate from duplication events that occurred before the chordate radiation.

nme <dig>  a novel eutherian nme8-related protein
the nme <dig> protein was recently characterized and classified as a member of group ii  <cit> . thus far, nme <dig> has only been found in human, mouse and cow databases but not in any non-mammalian vertebrate species . the human nme <dig> protein contains a thioredoxin domain  and an ndpk_tx domain that are also found in the n-terminus region of the human nme <dig> protein . similarly, nme <dig> and nme <dig> display a similar exon-intron structure in the 5'-region of the gene . it is also noteworthy that nme <dig> and nme <dig> genes are located on different chromosomes in both humans and mice. based on these observations, we hypothesize that nme <dig> originates from an incompletely translocated duplication of the nme <dig> gene. the position of human and mouse nme <dig> sequences in the phylogenetic analysis support the strong relationship between nme <dig> and nme <dig> . the position of nme <dig> sequences within the nme8/nme <dig> subtree is in contrast inconsistent with the above hypothesis. the possibility that prochordate, teleost, and amphibian nme <dig> proteins would be more closely related to mammalian nme <dig> proteins than to mammalian nme <dig> proteins can however be ruled out by the highly conserved exon-intron structure  and domain organization  of the nme <dig> gene among chordates. altogether, these results clearly indicate that nme <dig> belongs to the group ii of the nme proteins. given that nme <dig> gene could only be found in eutherians our data suggest that nme <dig> arose from a duplication event that occurred after the separation of eutherian and metatherian groups.

vertebrate nme proteins of the group i
in mammals, the group i nme is composed of nme <dig>  nme <dig>  nme <dig> and nme <dig> and orthologs could be identified in both anole lizard and chicken. the situation is in contrast much more complex for amphibians, teleosts, lamprey and prochordates as discussed below.

gnathostome nme <dig> and nme <dig> originate from an nme3/ <dig> vertebrate ancestor
in xenopus tropicalis, as well as in all studied teleost, orthologs of amniotes nme <dig> and nme <dig> proteins could be identified . the phylogenetic analysis of group i nme proteins reveals a strongly supported divergence of nme <dig> from other nme of the group i . at the amino-acid level, nme <dig> proteins exhibit sequence identities ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> % among vertebrates . nme <dig> protein domain structure is also very well conserved between human and zebrafish as the domain size is equal in both species  even though some minor differences exist in pre- and post-domain length . similarly, nme <dig> exon-intron structure is also very well conserved in xenopus, zebrafish and human, and differences only concern exon size in the pre-domain coding region . the phylogenetic analysis also suggests that nme <dig> proteins are divergent from nme1/nme <dig> . nme <dig> proteins display sequence identities ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> % among vertebrates . the nme <dig> protein domain structure  is identical in humans and zebrafish. similarly an identical exon-intron structure  was observed in xenopus tropicalis, human and zebrafish nme <dig> genes. together, these observations strongly suggest that despite the low support values of the nme <dig> branch on the phylogenetic tree , orthologs of mammalian nme <dig> proteins can be found in teleosts and amphibians. this conclusion is further supported by the phylogenetic analysis carried out using all available teleost nme sequences regardless of the genome sequencing status of the species  in which high bootstrap values support the nme <dig> branch.

in contrast to teleosts, amphibians and mammals, only one nme3/nme4-related sequence could be found in lamprey. interestingly, the phylogenetic analysis suggests that this sequence is related to both nme <dig> and nme <dig> groups . the exon-intron structure of this nme3/nme4-related lamprey gene reveals similarities with both nme <dig> and nme <dig> genes . interestingly, when adding non-coding and coding parts, the size of the second exon of the lamprey nme3/nme4-related gene is exactly the same as the size of the second exon of xenopus nme <dig>  zebrafish nme <dig>  human nme <dig>  and zebrafish nme <dig>  it should also be noted that for both nme <dig> and nme <dig>  the first intron is inserted after the first base of a codon. finally, it is noteworthy that nme <dig> and nme <dig> genes are always located on the same chromosome  at very close locations in mammals, chicken, xenopus and teleosts. altogether, these observations suggest that, in the vertebrate ancestor, for whom the lamprey is the most closely related descendant, only one nme3/nme4-related gene existed. we hypothesize that this ancestor nme3/nme <dig> gene gained a start codon in the first exon after the separation of cyclostomes and gnathostomes lineages. nme <dig> and nme <dig> subsequently arose from a cis-duplication of this gene that occurred before or around teleost radiation. the nme3/nme4-related gene found in lamprey was thus named nme3/ <dig> to reflect its phylogenetic relationship with nme <dig> and nme <dig> genes.

an amniote specific cis-duplication of nme1/ <dig> ancestor gene
in contrast to nme <dig> and nme <dig>  orthologs of both human nme <dig> and nme <dig> can only be found in amniotes and form two clusters corresponding to nme <dig> and nme <dig> proteins respectively . in xenopus tropicalis and lungfish , only one nme1/nme2-related protein was identified as shown by the phylogenetic analysis. no nme1-like cdna was found among the  <dig>  million xenopus tropicalis ests available in public databases . within amniotes, nme <dig> and nme <dig> are always located on the same chromosome . furthermore, in mammals and lizard, nme <dig> and nme <dig> are always located next to each other . in addition, the synteny analysis of nme <dig> and nme <dig> in tetrapods demonstrated that conserved genes in the vicinity of human nme <dig> and nme <dig> genes could be identified among all studied amniote species . in chicken, we hypothesize that a chromosomal inversion of the chromosomic part located between nme <dig> and myadl <dig> resulted in the separation of the two genes. in amniotes, nme <dig> and nme <dig> are always linked to mbtd <dig> and spag <dig>  in xenopus tropicalis, the synteny conservation in the vicinity of nme <dig> is less clear . nevertheless, note that dusp <dig> is in the vicinity of nme <dig> among all tetrapods with the exception of chicken and anole lizard. altogether, these observations suggest that, in all studied amniote species, nme <dig> and nme <dig> are co-orthologs of xenopus tropicalis nme1/nme2-related gene, and that a cis-duplication event of the ancestor gene occurred before or around amniote radiation. this observation is in total agreement with the conclusions made by ishikawa and coworkers  <cit>  indicating that rat and human nme <dig> and nme <dig> resulted from a cis-duplication of a common ancestor gene. this is also consistent with the previously made hypothesis of a duplication of the ancestor gene that occurred after the separation of tetrapods and fish lineages and after amphibians and amniotes divergence  <cit> . however, we cannot rule out that the cis-duplication of nme1/nme2-ancestor gene occurred before amphibian radiation. in that case, the duplication would have been followed by the loss of nme <dig> in amphibians. however, no trace of an nme <dig> gene could be found on xenopus tropicalis genomic sequence between nme <dig> and dusp <dig> genes . this observation would thus be in favor of the hypothesis of duplication of the nme1/nme <dig> ancestor gene after amphibian radiation.

mammalian nme <dig> is most closely related to the nme1/nme <dig> ancestor gene
comparison of the primary structure of nme <dig> and nme <dig> reveals that both proteins are highly conserved among amniotes with mean amino-acid  sequence identities of  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively . it is also noteworthy that nme <dig> is more conserved than nme <dig> among vertebrates. the phylogenetic analysis suggests that both lungfish  and xenopus nme1/nme2-related proteins would be more closely related to amniote nme <dig> than to nme <dig> . in addition, the exon-intron structure of xenopus nme1/nme2-related gene is highly similar to human nme <dig> exon-intron structure . this highly conserved exon-intron structure is also found in zebrafish . in contrast, human nme <dig> exon-intron structure is different from human nme <dig> and xenopus sequences as it exhibits an additional exon at the 5' end of the gene. together, these observations indicate that nme <dig> is most similar to the ancestor gene while nme <dig> exhibits a different exon-intron structure. for this reason, the xenopus tropicalis nme1/nme2-related gene was named nme <dig>  this name was thus also used for nme1/nme2-related genes found in teleosts and lamprey.

the nmelv form
using the different sequence databases available in amniotes, a long variant transcript, corresponding to a read-trough transcript of nme <dig> and nme <dig> genes can be found in human, chimpanzee, horse, cow, platypus, and anole lizard . in contrast, this read-through transcript could not be found in chicken in which a chromosomal inversion resulted in the separation of nme <dig> and nme <dig> genes on the chromosome. interestingly, the human transcript is composed of the first four exons of nme <dig> and all nme <dig> exons . to date, the corresponding protein, nme long variant  has only been studied in humans  <cit>  and no information is available in other species.

nme2a and nme2b in teleosts probably emerged from 3r genome duplication and nme2a is most similar to the vertebrate ancestor
in studied teleost species, the number of nme1/2-related genes varies from  <dig> to  <dig> depending on the species . as indicated above, these genes have been named nme <dig> because they are most similar to the nme <dig> gene . the phylogenetic analysis revealed that nme2a is present in the five teleost species with complete genome sequence, whereas nme2b genes could not be found in stickleback and tetraodon . in contrast, a single nme2b protein was found in medaka , and fugu  while, the phylogentic tree clearly indicates a further duplication of the nme2b gene in zebrafish resulting in two distinct proteins termed nme2b <dig> and nme2b <dig>  the phylogenic analysis also suggests that nme2a and nme2b are co-orthologs of the lamprey nme <dig>  this further confirms that the lamprey nme <dig> gene could be a direct descendant of the nme <dig> ancestor gene . in addition, zebrafish nme2a, nme2b <dig>  and nme2b <dig> have exactly the same protein domain structure, with the same total length and the same ndpk_ <dig> domain located at the same position . similarly, zebrafish nme2a, nme2b <dig>  and nme2b <dig> have exactly the same coding exon structure . as previously indicated, the exon-intron structure is well conserved among vertebrate nme <dig> genes and clearly distinct from the nme <dig> gene. conserved genes in the vicinity of nme2a gene in teleosts were identified among studied species by a synteny conservation study . for medaka, stickleback , tetraodon , and fugu, the synteny is well conserved and the mbtd <dig> gene was found in the vicinity of the nme2a gene in agreement to what is observed in tetrapods . interestingly, nakatani et al  <cit> , demonstrated that medaka chromosome  <dig>  on which is located nme2a, is orthologous to a part of human chromosome  <dig>  on which nme <dig> and nme <dig> are located. in addition, the primary structure appears to be more conserved for nme2a in comparison to nme2b as they display  <dig>  and  <dig> % mean aa identities respectively . altogether, these observations suggest that among teleost nme <dig> genes, nme2a is most similar to the ancestor gene. in teleost, the nme2b gene was not found in tetraodon and stickleback, thus indicating a possible loss of this gene in both species. furthermore, for all studied teleosts displaying nme2a and nme2b, the two paralogous genes are always located on different chromosomes or scaffolds . interestingly, the fugu nme2b gene is associated to a paralog of mbtd <dig> , suggesting that the duplication event from which nme2a and nme2b arose in teleost is linked to the teleost-specific third round of whole genome duplication . the phylogenetic analysis performed using all available nme <dig> sequences in teleosts  would be in favor of this hypothesis as numerous other teleost species from different genders such as seabream , pike , seabass , black cod , and grouper  exhibit nme2a and nme2b genes. finally, it is noteworthy that, in contrast to nme <dig>  gene duplicates resulting from 3r whole genome duplication were not retained for other teleost nme genes.

nme2b <dig> and nme2b <dig> emerged from a cis-duplication of nme2b
in contrast to nme2a, very little information is available on the position of nme2b genes in teleosts as they are all located on scaffolds. in zebrafish, it should nevertheless be noted that nme2b <dig> and nme2b <dig> genes are located in tandem on the same scaffold . this suggests a cis-duplication event of zebrafish nme2b ancestor gene from which nme2b <dig> and nme2b <dig> genes arose.

the nme gene repertoire in the vertebrate ancestor
in order to better characterize the putative nme gene repertoire of the vertebrate ancestor, we have analyzed nme-related sequences available in the two prochordate ciona intestinalis and branchiostoma floridae. as discussed above, orthologs for nme <dig>  nme <dig>  nme <dig>  nme <dig> and nme <dig> could be identified, thus indicating that these genes emerged before chordate radiation . concerning group i nme, two sequences could be found in both species. in the lancelet, the genome second assembly available from the joint genome institute  <cit> , clearly shows that only two group i nme genes are present in the lancelet genome. the phylogenetic analysis , clearly indicates that the two lancelet sequences are closely related to each other but clearly divergent from ciona intestinalis, lamprey and tetrapod nme1/nme <dig> sequences. similarly, the two ciona intestinalis sequences are closely related to each other but highly divergent from other nme1/nme <dig> sequences. in this species, both genes are located on different chromosomes whereas in the lancelet they are located in tandem on the same chromosome. altogether, these observations suggest that the group i nme gene pair arose from a cis-duplication of an ancestor gene in lancelet, whereas emergence of the two group i nme genes in ciona is more likely to be explained by a duplication followed by a translocation event. we thus hypothesize that in each species, the two genes result from an independent duplication event of an ancestor gene common to all chordates. this would be consistent with the number of group i nme genes in lamprey, as generation of nme <dig> and nme3/ <dig> can be explained by the first round of whole genome duplication  which occurred early in the vertebrate lineage  <cit> . the ancestor gene, from which emerged all group i nme, was thus named nmegroupi  .

expression and putative functions of nme proteins
nme1/2-related proteins
given its role in metastatic dissemination, the nme <dig> protein, has been extensively studied in humans and rodents  <cit> . a significant amount of data is also available for nme <dig>  <cit> . homologs of human genes were identified in several vertebrate species, such as rodents  <cit> , cow  <cit> , xenopus laevis  <cit> , zebrafish  <cit> , salmon  <cit> ; and non-vertebrate species such as scallop  <cit> , drosophila  <cit> , dictyostelium discoideum  <cit> , myxococcus xanthus  <cit> , schizosaccharomyces pombe  <cit>  and various plants  <cit> . the orthology relationship of these nme1/2-related proteins with human counterparts was not, however, always thoroughly characterized. nme1/2-related proteins, as all group i nme, display a single ndpk_ <dig> domain , and various enzymatic assays demonstrated its kinase activity in different species  <cit> . according to our observations , the zebrafish nme <dig> proteins display all the key residues for enzyme structure and activity  <cit>  thus suggesting that nme <dig> protein could exhibit a ndpk activity. nme <dig> is widely expressed in adult tissues as shown in rat  <cit>  and mouse  <cit> . during mouse embryogenesis, nme <dig> protein accumulation is coincident with the functional differentiation of multiple organs  <cit> . no data are available about tissue expression of nme <dig> in adult xenopus. during xenopus laevis early development, nme <dig> transcripts cannot be detected before mid-blastula transition  but are expressed in differentiating tissues at later stages, thus suggesting an implication in cell differentiation and proliferation  <cit> . our tissue distribution study has shown that the three nme <dig> zebrafish genes have very different tissue expression patterns . in a previous study, an nme <dig> homolog was cloned in zebrafish  <cit> . this transcript, initially named nme23-b, corresponds to nme2b <dig> and was found to be expressed in hepatopancreas, head, ovary, and intestine by northern blot analysis. these observations are in total agreement with the broad tissues distribution of nme2b <dig> with a predominant expression in ovary and gills  reported in the present study. in contrast to what is observed for nme2b <dig>  zebrafish nme2a and nme2b <dig> have very specific tissue distributions . it should however be stressed that, despite the extremely high expression in muscle, nme2b <dig> is also significantly expressed in all assayed tissues. similarly nme2a expression is also weakly detected in all tissues in addition to the strong expression observed in eyes and testis. in atlantic salmon, an nme2-related mrna, belonging to the nme2a sub-family , is highly expressed in brain, and during early development it could not be detected before the end of gastrulation  <cit> . altogether, the tissue distribution of the three zebrafish nme <dig> genes suggests that nme2a and nme2b genes have undergone specialization after duplication of a common ancestor nme <dig> gene  <cit> . interestingly, cañestro et al  <cit>  recently demonstrated that in the case of the loss of one paralog after a duplication event, the surviving paralog can display combined expression pattern of both paralogs kept in another species. in the light of this conclusion, it would be interesting to study nme <dig> expression in species that lack the nme2b copy. human nme <dig> was first identified as the puf transcription factor that recognizes a nuclease hypersensitive site  motif in the c-myc promoter and stimulates transcription  <cit> . nme <dig> transcriptional activation of c-myc gene by binding to its promoter was confirmed in mouse  <cit>  and xenopus laevis  <cit> . furthermore, awd, the drosophila nme <dig> homolog, is required for proper differentiation and tissues morphology  <cit> . thus, nme <dig> expression pattern during embryogenesis is consistent with implication in cell proliferation and differentiation. in addition, human nme <dig> may associate with estrogen receptor-β and is able to modulate estrogen-induced gene transcription  <cit> . implication of nme <dig> in regulation of gene expression has also been demonstrated for other genes implicated in several biological processes including nuclease activity . altogether, available data suggest that vertebrates nme <dig> proteins are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes that require further investigations.

nme3
the nme <dig> protein has been characterized in humans  <cit>  and mice  <cit> . nme <dig>  as all the proteins of the group i, displays a single ndpk_ <dig> domain . in humans, enzymatic activity could not be measured using the full length recombinant protein  <cit> , but a truncated recombinant protein displayed kinase activity similar to that of the nme <dig> and nme  <dig> proteins  <cit> . we show here that zebrafish nme <dig> possesses all the residues necessary for enzyme structure and activity  <cit>  . together, these observations would suggest an ndpk activity of the zebrafish nme <dig>  zebrafish tissue distribution analysis showed that nme <dig> is expressed in all studied tissues with the strongest expression in the ovary, and a lower, but significant, expression in testis, eye and gills . to our knowledge, the strong ovarian expression of nme <dig> has never been reported in vertebrates in a non-malignant context. in contrast, existing data indicate that human nme <dig> is ubiquitously expressed in non-metastatic tissues with a particularly strong expression in specific structures of the brain  <cit> . during mouse organogenesis, nme <dig> is preferentially expressed in the nervous and sensory system  <cit> , whereas in adult mouse, transcripts are found ubiquitously distributed with higher expression in brain and liver  <cit> . during xenopus laevis embryogenesis, it was shown that nme <dig> was predominantly expressed in the head region  <cit> . to date, very little is known about nme <dig> function in a non-malignant context. it was shown that over-expression of nme <dig> gene in 32dc <dig> peripheral blood cells inhibited differentiation into granulocytes and caused apoptosis  <cit> , without requiring ndpk enzymatic activity  <cit> . in addition, it was shown that nme <dig> induces morphological changes associated with neural differentiation in neuroblastoma cells  <cit>  and that it could act on cell motility by enhancing the amount of integrin β  <cit> . in the xenopus laevis it was shown that nme <dig> was highly expressed in the ciliary marginal zone of the retina and involvement of nme <dig> in cell fate determination during retinogenesis was therefore suggested  <cit> . it was also shown that nme <dig> was an estrogen-responsive gene in the context of mammary tumors  <cit> . to date, no information is available on the physiological or cellular functions of nme <dig> in teleosts. however, an implication in cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis can be hypothesized.

nme4
nme <dig> protein has been characterized in humans  <cit> , mouse  <cit> , pigeon  <cit>  and xenopus laevis  <cit> . nme <dig>  as all group i nme, is composed of a single ndpk_ <dig> domain . zebrafish nme <dig> possesses all the residues necessary for enzyme structure and kinase activity  <cit>  . in humans, the enzymatic activity of nme <dig> was experimentally confirmed  <cit> . as reported here , all studied nme <dig> tetrapod proteins naturally display a serine residue at position  <dig>  equivalent to the lethal killer of prune  mutation of the drosophila  <cit> . it was previously shown that the presence of serine <dig> residue has local structural effects that weaken subunit interactions and decreases hexamer stability  <cit> . strikingly, teleost nme <dig> sequences do not display the serine <dig>  but display the proline <dig> shared by all other group i nme members . the presence of this mutation in tetrapod proteins that cannot be found in any studied teleost species suggests that this mutation appeared just after the sarcopterigian radiation. it was recently shown that human nme <dig> binds the inner mitochondrial membrane and couples nucleotide transfer with respiration  <cit> . the binding property to mitochondrial membranes is due to electrostatic interactions between the central arginine <dig> of a triad of basic residue and anionic phospholipids  <cit> . a basic residue equivalent to arg <dig> can also be found in mouse, xenopus tropicalis and zebrafish nme <dig> . tetraodon nme <dig> possesses a hydrophobic methionine and might be able to electrostatically interact with anionic phospholipids too. in contrast, chicken and other studied teleost nme <dig> sequences display a hydrophilic residue in position  <dig>  this could suggest that these nme <dig> are unable to interact with anionic phospholipids. it has been shown that pigeon nme <dig>  also displaying a hydrophilic 90-residue, is located in the mitochondrial matrix  <cit> . many functions such as nucleotide supply, functional interactions with krebs cycle succinyl thiokinase, catabolism of short chain fatty acids  <cit>  and, more recently, gtp synthesis in relationship with iron homeostasis  <cit>  have been proposed. in the present study, we report that zebrafish nme <dig> is highly and predominantly expressed in gonads, weakly expressed in gills, and barely detectable in other studied tissue . in contrast, human nme <dig> was shown to be widely distributed and expressed in a tissue-dependant manner with a moderate expression in liver, muscle and ovary and a low expression in testis and brain  <cit> . in mouse, nme <dig> was only detectable in heart, liver and kidney  <cit> . in xenopus laevis, nme <dig> is predominantly expressed in the head region and an indirect regulation of retinal gliogenesis by nme <dig> was demonstrated  <cit> . the gonad-predominant expression of nme <dig> reported here, if confirmed in other teleost species, could suggest a different function of fish nme <dig> in gonads in comparison to mammalian nme <dig>  however, a relative rate test  <cit>  did not reveal a significantly different evolutionary rate between tetrapods and fish . this suggests that observed differences in expression patterns reported above are not linked to different evolutionary rates.

nme <dig> sequences have been characterized in humans  <cit>  and mouse  <cit> . the zebrafish nme <dig>  as human nme <dig>  is composed of an ndpk <dig> domain followed by a dpy- <dig> domain . in agreement with previous observations made in human and mouse  <cit> , the zebrafish ndpk <dig> domain also lacks three of the eleven residues deemed crucial for enzyme structure and activity  <cit>  . the lack of kinase activity was confirmed using human recombinant proteins  <cit> . however, a pronounced 3'→ 5' exonuclease activity was measured for human nme <dig>  <cit> . in zebrafish, nme <dig> was predominantly expressed in testis and detected at low levels in brain and ovary . our results are in total agreement with data obtained in humans  <cit>  and mouse  <cit>  in which a predominant testis expression was observed. low expression levels were also detected in human brain and kidney  <cit>  while a low expression of the mouse transcript was detected in ovary, heart, kidney, and brain  <cit> . in human testis, nme <dig> gene expression is located in spermatogonia and early spermatocytes  <cit> , whereas expression appears at pachytene stages in mouse  <cit> . a marked delay in protein expression can be observed as nme <dig> protein is only found in the flagella of spermatids and spermatozoa, adjacent to the central pair and outer doublets of axonemal microtubules  <cit> . functionally, murine nme <dig> protein might be involved in late spermiogenesis by increasing the ability of late-stage spermatids to eliminate reactive oxygen species  <cit> . together, our observations suggest that, within group ii, the nme <dig> protein of vertebrates probably lacks ndpk activity and might have evolved towards testicular functions, possibly in germ cells.

nme6
to date, nme <dig> has only been sequenced and characterized in humans  <cit> . zebrafish nme <dig> displays a single ndpk <dig> domain, also found in the human protein  <cit>  . in contrast to human nme <dig>  the zebrafish nme <dig> lacks one of the eleven residues deemed crucial for enzyme structure and activity, i.e. phenylalanine <dig>  but display a phe in position  <dig>  <cit> ., using e. coli recombinant proteins, it was shown that human ndpk <dig> domain exhibited a kinase activity  <cit> . this observation was, however, not confirmed in another study  <cit> . zebrafish nme <dig> is expressed in all studied tissues apart from hepatopancreas and intestine, and the highest expression levels were observed in ovary and gills . our results are consistent with previous rt-pcr results showing that nme <dig> was expressed in every human tissue, with strongest expression in ovary/placenta, muscle and intestine  <cit> . very little is known about nme <dig> function or expression in a non-malignant context. however, it has been hypothesized that nme <dig> protein was partially colocalized with mitochondria and that over expression in saos <dig> cells resulted in growth suppression and generation of multinucleated cells. thus, nme <dig> may play a role in regulation of cell growth and cell cycle progression  <cit> . all together, our results suggest that zebrafish nme <dig> could possess kinase activity and might have conserved a crucial role in cell cycle, growth or development.

nme7
to date, very little is known about human nme <dig>  <cit> . the zebrafish nme <dig>  as human nme <dig>  contains a duf <dig> domain, belonging to the dm <dig> family, and an ndpk_7a and an ndpk_7b domain . very little is known about the function of duf <dig> domain and its dm <dig> family. however, it was suggested that this domain family may act as flagellar ndpk regulatory modules or as units specifically involved in axonemal targeting or assembly  <cit> . in contrast to the human ndpk_7a domain, the zebrafish domain displays all the residues deemed crucial for enzyme structure and activity  <cit>  . in addition, human and zebrafish ndpk_7b domain respectively lack  <dig> and  <dig> residues deemed crucial for enzyme structure and activity  <cit> . yoon et al  <cit>  confirmed the lack of kinase activity in human nme <dig> but reported a marked exonuclease activity. zebrafish nme <dig> is predominantly expressed in gonads and only a weak expression can be found in other studied tissue . our results are consistent with human nme <dig> expression which is predominantly expressed in testis and expressed at significant levels in ovary and brain  <cit> .

nme <dig> and nme9
to date, nme <dig> protein has only been described in humans and mice and was called sptrx <dig> for its resemblance with another protein, sptrx <dig>  also displaying a thioredoxin domain  <cit> . an orthologous gene was also characterized in ciona intestinalis  <cit> . proteins of this family are made of one thioredoxin domain  followed by three tandemly repeated ndp kinase domains  . nme <dig> protein domain structure is very well conserved between human and zebrafish, with the exception of the third zebrafish ndpk-tx domain which is truncated. nme <dig> protein was also only described in humans  <cit>  and displays a thioredoxin domain associated to a ndpk_tx domain . despite their thioredoxin domain, no thioredoxin activity, corresponding to a general protein-disulfide reductase, could be detected neither in nme <dig>  <cit>  nor in nme <dig>  <cit> . our results also show that the zebrafish ndpk_tx domains lacks crucial amino acids for kinase activity  <cit>   and are consistent with several enzymatic studies  <cit> . similarly to nme <dig> and  <dig>  human nme <dig> exhibits exonuclease activity  <cit> . zebrafish nme <dig> is highly and predominantly expressed in testis and significantly detected in gills in comparison to all other tissues . this observation is in complete agreement with existing data in mammals  <cit> . as previously reported, nme <dig> protein have domain arrangement similarities with sea urchin ic <dig>  a member of the dynein intermediate chain  <cit> . the functional implication of nme <dig> in sperm axonemal organization was suggested  <cit>  and key role of nme <dig> in flagellar anomalies and primary ciliary dyskinesia was disclosed  <cit> . human nme <dig> was also described as highly expressed in testis but also in lung and other ciliated cell containing tissue and able to associate with microtubules  <cit> . together, these observations suggest that zebrafish nme <dig> might also be implicated in testicular function, possibly in axonemal organization.

nme10
nme <dig>  also called xrp <dig>  is the most recently described member of the nme family and was only characterized in human and mouse  <cit> . vertebrate nme <dig> proteins display a tbcc  domain and a partial ndpk domain . the tbcc domain acts as a gtpase activating protein  for β-tubulin  <cit> . the zebrafish partial ndpk domain lacks many crucial amino acids for kinase activity, in particular the catalytic histidine  <cit> . the lack of ndpk activity in human nme <dig> was confirmed by enzymatic assay  <cit> . similarly to nme <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  nme <dig> exhibits exonuclease activity  <cit> . zebrafish nme <dig> is predominantly expressed in the ovary and only a weak expression can be found in other studied tissue . in humans and mice, nme <dig> was found to be expressed in a wide variety of tissues  <cit> . strong ovarian expression was however never reported as no study used ovarian tissue to study nme <dig> expression. in humans, mutation in the nme <dig> gene induce retinitis pigmentosa, the major form of heritable blindness  <cit> . interestingly, the partial ndpk domain of nme <dig> protein may have important function as most disease-related mutations of the nme <dig> gene concern this part of the protein  <cit> . furthermore, the human nme <dig> protein, shown to be mainly located into the cytoplasm, undergoes re-localization into the nucleus when cells are treated with dna damaging agent inducing oxidative stress, thus suggesting a participation in dna repairing reactions  <cit> . the roles of nme <dig> in fish and all other non-mammalian species are currently unknown and deserve specific studies. the ovarian-predominant expression, if confirmed in other species, is rather intriguing as it could suggest a major role of nme <dig> in oogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we provide a comprehensive overview of the evolutionary history of the nme family in vertebrates . we also provide a characterization of the nme gene repertoire in several vertebrate species including non-mammalian species and propose a gene nomenclature that is consistent with existing mammalian nomenclature. our observations show that vertebrate nme genes can be separated in two evolutionary distinct groups. nme <dig>  nme <dig>  nme <dig>  and nme <dig> belong to the group i while vertebrate nme <dig>  nme <dig>  nme <dig>  nme <dig>  and nme <dig> belong to the group ii. the position of nme <dig> in the group ii is in contrast more debatable due to its very specific evolutionary history and the recent incorporation of an ndpk domain, before or around the gnathostome radiation. the present study clearly indicates that nme <dig>  nme <dig>  nme <dig>  and nme <dig> originate from duplication events that occurred before the chordate radiation. finally, we show that nme <dig> is a mammalian-specific protein closely related to nme <dig> that arose from the cis-duplication of the nme8/nme <dig> ancestor gene after the separation of eutherians and metatherians. in contrast to the group ii, nme genes of the group i have a totally different evolutionary history. our observations suggest that a single group i gene ancestor was present in the chordate ancestor genome. the first round of whole genome duplication  then resulted in two distinct genes named nme <dig> and nme3/ <dig> that can be found in the lamprey genome. in contrast, no duplicates seem to have been retained after the second round of whole genome duplication . we provide evidence that the nme3/ <dig> gene was cis-duplicated, thus resulting in nme <dig> and nme <dig> genes that can be found in all investigated gnathostome genomes. our analyses also suggest that the nme <dig> gene found in mammals, chicken and lizard results from the duplication of the nme <dig> gene that occurred after amphibian radiation. in teleosts, the third round of whole genome duplication  resulted in the apparition of two paralogous genes, nme2a and nme2b. while nme2a could be found in all teleost genomes, nme2b underwent different fates depending on the species. finally, based on protein structure and tissue expression of zebrafish nme genes, we provide new insights in tissue specificity and molecular functions of nme proteins in vertebrates and raise intriguing questions on the role of nme protein in the vertebrate gonads.
