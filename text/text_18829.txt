BACKGROUND
trnas are the most frequently modified cellular rnas in all three phylogenetic domains of life. to date, almost  <dig> modified nucleosides have been reported in the trna sequence database . position  <dig> in trnas, the 5′ nucleoside of the anticodon triplet, also known as the wobble position, exhibits the greatest propensity for post-transcriptional modification, with nearly 50% of all e. coli trnas bearing modifications at this site  <cit> . modifications at the wobble position affect the codon recognition properties of the trna and are essential for the accurate and complete reading of the genetic code  <cit> . the wobble hypothesis was proposed by crick to account for the observation that most organisms code for considerably fewer trnas than the number of sense codons, precluding a simple one-to-one correspondence between codon and trna. specifically, he postulated that the first nucleoside of the anticodon is less constrained than the last two, which results in the required degeneracy by allowing non-canonical recognition  of the last nucleoside of a codon presented on the ribosome  <cit> .

accumulating trna sequence data and increased knowledge of the chemical structures of modified nucleosides led to a modified wobble hypothesis, which encompasses the effects of post-transcriptionally modified uridines frequently found at the anticodon wobble position in bacteria and eukaryotic  <cit> . for example, oxyacetyl uridine  at the wobble position allows trnaval and trnapro to recognize all four bases in the 3′ position of the codon, while modification of u <dig> to 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine  enables trnaglu and trnalys to read codons ending in a or g but not c or u  <cit> . in addition, 5-methylaminomethyl uridine , which lacks thiolation at c <dig> of the pyrimidine, permits trnaarg to decode aga and agg, but not agc and agu.

in e. coli, the enzymes involved in biosynthesis of the thiol-bearing mnm5s2u <dig> have been identified; mnma , together with the cysteine desulfurase iscs, catalyze the thiolation of position  <dig> of the wobble uridine, leading to 2-thiouridine  on trnaglu and trnalys <cit> . mnme and mnmg form an α2β <dig> heterotetramer  <cit>  that catalyzes transformation of the wobble uridine and s2u <dig> to 5-carboxymethyl aminomethyl uridine  and 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine , respectively. these modifications at 2- and 5- positions have been shown to occur independently to each other  <cit> . mnmc  is a bifunctional enzyme responsible for the final two steps of biosynthetic pathway of mnm5s2u in trnaglu and trnalys, and mnm5u in trnaarg <cit> . as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the c-terminal domain  catalyzes the flavin adenine dinucleotide -dependent oxidation of the cα-n bond in cmnm5u <dig>  the resulting imine intermediate is  non-enzymatically hydrolyzed to 5-aminomethyl uridine , followed by s-adenosyl l-methionine -dependent methylation to yield mnm5u in the n-terminal domain active site . bifunctional mnmc is found predominately in γ-proteobacteria, while non-fused orthologs of the mnmc <dig> and mnmc <dig> domains are present in various other bacteria  <cit> . although mnmc is not essential for e. coli, the Δmnmc strain exhibits a slower growth rate compared to the wild-type, suggesting that cmnm5u <dig> is not as efficient as mnm5u <dig> in supporting translation  <cit> .

to date, crystal structures have been reported for the fad-bound bifunctional mnmc , the isolated mnmc <dig> domain  and the stand-alone mnmc <dig> from aquifex aeolicus . here we present the fad/sam-bound crystal structures of full-length mnmc from e. coli  and y. pestis , and an fad-bound crystal structure of ypmnmc. these are the first experimentally determined structures of bifunctional mnmc with both fad and sam bound, and reveal the architectures of both active sites, as well as the detailed interactions between the mnmc <dig> and the mnmc <dig> domains. these structures also suggest features of mnmc catalysis that will aid further kinetic and mechanistic investigations.

RESULTS
mnmc is monomer in solution
the oligomeric state of mnmc was examined by size exclusion chromatography. under the conditions employed, ypmnmc and ecmnmc eluted from a superdex <dig> column at  <dig>  ml and  <dig>  ml, respectively . bovine albumin  eluted at  <dig>  ml, close to the size of monomeric mnmc, ~ <dig> kd; γ-globulin , which approximates the molecular weight of a putative mnmc dimer, eluted considerably faster at  <dig>  ml. these data are consistent with a model in which mnmc exists as a monomer in solution.

functional assay of mnmc
to confirm that our recombinant mnmc utilizes cmnmu34-trna as a substrate, post-transcriptionally modified trnaarg substrate was generated in situ by incubating in vitro transcribed pre-trnaarg with mnme and mnmg, as well as the necessary substrates including glycine, nadh, 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate , and gtp, in addition to 14c-labeled sam and mnmc . after quenching the reaction with  <dig> % tca, the precipitated rnas were bound on an ion exchange cellulose filter, which was washed extensively with  <dig> % tca and examined for retention of radioactivity. the dual activity of e. coli and y. pestis mnmc was confirmed by the incorporation of 14c-label on the modified trna as shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

overall structure of mnmc
each mnmc crystal structure contains a monomer in the asymmetric unit . consistent with the observed monomeric state of mnmc in solution, no significant oligomeric interfaces could be detected between symmetry related molecules in the two crystal forms examined. in the fad- and fad/sam-bound ypmnmc structures, of the  <dig> residues, the first  <dig> n-terminal residues, 183– <dig>   <dig>  and 602– <dig> are not represented by electron density. in the ecmnmc structure, out of  <dig> residues, only residues 15– <dig> and 664– <dig> could not be modeled. all three structures of bifunctional mnmc exhibit a similar organization with the mnmc <dig> and mnmc <dig> domains being connected by a stretch of ~ <dig> amino acids  .

data collection and refinement statistics for the fad/sam-bound ecmnmc, fad-bound ypmnmc and fad/sam-bound ypmnmc. values for the outer resolution shell of data are given in parentheses.

subsequent to the release of our structures in the pdb, an independent ecmnmc structure was deposited in the pdb and the associated report of the  <dig> Å resolution structure of fad-bound ecmnmc appeared  <cit> . in addition to higher resolution , the current work extends these findings by demonstrating the structural conservation of the bifunctional mnmc molecule between species , providing the first description of the bi-liganded complexes  from both e. coli and y. pestis and by offering a detailed mechanistic analysis of the two reactions catalyzed by this bifunctional enzyme.

n-terminal domain of mnmc
the n-terminal mnmc <dig> domain is composed of residues 1– <dig> and contains the sam binding site. our structures show that ecmnmc and ypmnmc bind sam in an almost identical manner . the ~ <dig> disordered n-terminal residues in the ypmnmc structures are near sam binding site; however, this conformational flexibility does not appear to affect sam binding, as the ligand was fully occupied in crystals of ypmnmc which had been soaked in mother liquor containing  <dig> mm sam . importantly, the recombinant ypmnmc is catalytically active, as shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

the binding pocket for sam in mnmc is composed of mostly hydrophobic residues, except for glu- <dig> and asp- <dig> in both ecmnmc and ypmnmc. glu- <dig>  which is nearly invariant among sam-dependent methyltransferases, is engaged in hydrogen bonds, involving its acidic side chain, with the 2′- and 3′- oh groups of the ribose moiety of sam. asp- <dig> is also highly conserved among bifunctional mnmc , and forms a polar interaction with the amino group of sam via its acidic side chain. most interactions between sam and the protein occur through van der waals contacts and hydrogen bonds with backbone carbonyl groups, including phe- <dig>  thr- <dig>  and ile- <dig> in the ecmnmc structure. although the overall architecture of the binding pocket is highly similar, a few additional residues are found within hydrogen bonding distance from sam in ypmnmc; e.g., thr- <dig>  asn- <dig>  asp- <dig>  and asp- <dig>  which interact via their side chains, and leu- <dig>  asn- <dig> and val- <dig> via backbone amide group .

c-terminal domain of mnmc
all three mnmc structures unambiguously exhibited bound fad , even though the cofactor was not added during purification or crystallization. fad interacts extensively with the c-terminal ecmnmc <dig> domain through  <dig> hydrogen bonds with side chain and backbone atoms of  <dig> residues within  <dig>  Å . notably, ser- <dig> appears to be critical as it is positioned to make multiple hydrogen bonding interactions in both ecmnmc and ypmnmc. this serine residue is conserved in most bifunctional mnmc , and in all  <dig> monofunctional mnmc <dig> enzymes surveyed . in addition, a chloride ion was modeled near the flavin ring in both ecmnmc and ypmnmc. electron density for this feature was too strong for water, but the lack of coordination to nearby protein residues or water molecules suggest that it is not a metal ion. chloride does not appear to be directly involved in trna binding, as these species approach opposite sides of flavin ring .

domain interface between mnmc <dig> and mnmc2
each domain contributes about  <dig> residues to the interdomain interface, which buries  <dig> Å <dig> of accessible surface area in ecmnmc . in ypmnmc, a smaller solvent accessible surface area of  <dig> Å <dig> is buried due to the disordered n-terminal residues. in both ecmnmc and ypmnmc, β <dig>  from the mnmc <dig> domain and α <dig>  from the mnmc <dig> domain form the core of the interface . the remainder of the interdomain interactions involves residues within loops or turns from each domain, including segments 130– <dig>  144– <dig>  and 163– <dig> in the ecmnmc <dig>  and 284– <dig>  371– <dig>  and 637– <dig> in the ecmnmc <dig> domain. corresponding interdomain interactions in ypmnm involve residues 130– <dig>  144– <dig>  163– <dig> in ypmnmc <dig>  and 284– <dig>  374– <dig>  and 649– <dig> in ypmnmc <dig>  a number of polar residues from both domains are capable of participating in hydrogen bonding interactions as shown in figure  <dig> and additional file 1: table s <dig>  in addition, there are three pairs of ionic interactions in ecmnmc; e.g., arg-94/glu- <dig>  arg-107/glu- <dig>  and arg-140/glu-628; only the arg-140/glu- <dig> interaction is present in ypmnmc.

discussion
the crystal structures of ecmnmc and ypmnmc reveal the overall architecture of the full-length bifunctional mnmc, as well as a detailed description of the determinants responsible for binding the sam and fad cofactors in the two active sites. ypmnmc and ecmnmc share 61% overall sequence identity and exhibit similar structural organization with an rmsd of  <dig>  Å calculated over  <dig> cαs . all of the current structures exhibit fad bound in the mnmc <dig> active site, consistent with the previous identification of this cofactor by tlc analysis  <cit> . the binding mode of sam within the mnmc <dig> domain was examined by soaking pre-existing crystals, which did not elicit any significant structural alteration of the mnmc <dig> domain or reorganization of the mnmc1/mnmc <dig> interface. the architecture of mnmc clearly defines the arrangement of the two domains, which separates the catalytic sites for fad-dependent oxidation and sam-dependent methylation by approximately  <dig> Å.

evolutionarily conserved residues within mnmc
the national center for biotechnology information  data base identifies ~ <dig>  bifunctional mnmc orthologs , which are found predominately among the γ-proteobacteria, as well as in some α-, β-, and ϵ-proteobacteria. the mapping of conserved residues onto the ecmnmc structure reveals highly conserved surfaces involved in recognition of the fad and sam cofactors, as well other regions in close proximity to the active sites, which are likely to be involved in trna binding .

there are  <dig> residues that are conserved in greater than 98% of the  <dig> bifunctional mnmc surveyed . of these, nine cluster around the sam binding site, with three being near the fad binding site. the function of the remaining six residues is not entirely clear, although leu- <dig> and gly- <dig> are located near the interdomain interface, presumably playing a structural role in maintaining the domain-domain interface. interestingly, the residues at the domain interface are generally not highly conserved, with only two residues, gly- <dig> and leu- <dig>  exhibiting greater than 90% conservation . the interdomain linker  is one of the most divergent segments.

residues that are conserved greater than 98% among  <dig> bifunctional mnmc. the numbering is based on the ecmnmc amino acid sequence.

surface electrostatic potential of the ecmnmc structure
to illustrate the charge distribution on the surface of mnmc, electrostatic potential was mapped onto the surface of the ecmnmc structure   <cit> . this mapping highlights the fact that the protein surface is predominately negatively charged, with positive electrostatic potential concentrated around the active sites. this distribution supports a mechanism in which the basic patches surrounding both active sites facilitate interactions with the large polyanionic substrates and in particular with the negatively charged phosphodiester backbone proximal to cmnm5s2u <dig> or cmnm5u <dig> in trna substrates. notably, these patches of electropositive potential significantly overlap with the highly conserved residues around the ligand binding sites described above  and likely serve as the binding platform for trna.

the electrostatics around the interdomain interface is of particular interest, as it highlights the charge complementarity between the two domains. as shown in figure  <dig>  the interdomain interface may be dissected into four patches on the basis of local physico-chemical properties. the negatively charged patch i in ecmnmc <dig>  which includes residues asp- <dig> and asp- <dig>  interacts with the positively charged patch i in ecmnmc <dig>  largely through backbone amide nitrogen atoms. patch ii, located at the core of the interface contributes primarily hydrophobic interactions. patch iii in ecmnmc <dig> includes arg- <dig> and arg- <dig>  the side chains of which interacts with the negatively charged patch iii in ecmnmc <dig>  composed mostly of carbonyl oxygen atoms. glu- <dig> and glu- <dig>  contributed by patch iv of ecmnmc <dig>  interact with the side chains of his- <dig>  arg- <dig>  and arg- <dig> in ecmnmc <dig>  therefore, the interdomain interface of bifunctional mnmc appears to be maintained through a combination of hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic complementarity between the two domains.

this same strategy for stabilization of the interdomain interface is observed in ypmnmc, as the overall charge distribution on the surfaces contributing to the interface between ypmnmc <dig> and ypmnmc <dig> are similar to those in ecmnmc . it is intriguing since most residues at the interface are variable in the bifunctional mnmcs. however, the above mentioned polar residues on the ecmnmc interface surface are mostly conserved in the ypmnmc with exceptions of his- <dig> and arg- <dig>  which are replaced with gln- <dig> and thr- <dig>  respectively. it will be interesting to examine whether other bifunctional mnmc employ a similar strategy.

mnmc <dig> is structurally homologous to glycine oxidase of b. subtilis
structural superposition of mnmc <dig> against the entire pdb returned four independent bacillus subtilis glycine oxidase structures  as the most similar, with rmsds of  <dig>  -  <dig>  Å  <cit> . ecmnmc <dig> and glycine oxidase share only 22% sequence identity, with the greatest conservation present in β <dig> and α <dig> which contribute to the fad binding pocket. glycine oxidase is a required for thiamin biosynthesis in b. subtilis, but not in e. coli <cit> , and catalyzes the fad-dependent oxidation of glycine to iminoglyoxylate, which is trapped by thiocarboxylated this in the next step of the thiazol biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . in vitro assays demonstrate that oxidized glycine is non-enzymatically hydrolyzed to yield ammonium ion, hydrogen peroxide, and glyoxylic acid  <cit> , which is analogous to the non-enzymatic hydrolytic reaction associated with mnmc <dig> .

intriguingly, the reaction catalyzed by glycine oxidase is highly analogous to the proposed mnmc1-catalyzed reaction  <cit> . the overall architectures of the mnmc <dig> domain and glycine oxidase are strikingly similar, as are the organization of the catalytic sites . superposition of the structure of glycine oxidase bound to n-acetyl glycine with ecmnmc  provides a model in which the cα of glycine is  <dig>  Å away from n <dig> of flavin in mnmc <dig>  which is very similar to the analogous distance of  <dig>  Å in glycine oxidase. on the basis of the n-acetyl glycine-bound crystal structure and deuterium isotope experiments, a direct hydride transfer mechanism is favored for glycine oxidase, over mechanisms involving formation of a covalent intermediate between flavin and glycine, or mechanisms which are radical-based  <cit> . at present, it is not clear, however, which oxidative mechanism is utilized by mnmc <dig>  no significant activity was observed when ecmnmc was assayed for the oxidative deamination of glycine or sarcosine  . it appears that structural and/or chemical determinants of the modified trna substrate are required for turnover by mnmc. it is tempting to speculate that mnmc <dig>  which catalyzes the oxidative deamination of hypermodified wobble uridine , evolved from glycine oxidase and mnmc <dig> was subsequently recruited to form a single polypeptide with sam-dependent methyltransferase activity.

mechanistic implications of the mnmc <dig> active site
sam-bound structures of both ecmnmc and ypmnmc show that asp- <dig> is the only charged residue near sam, except for glu- <dig>  which anchors the ribosyl moiety through multiple hydrogen bonds with its side chain. the distance between cϵ of sam and oδ of the asp- <dig> side chain is  <dig>  Å in ecmnmc and  <dig>  Å in ypmnmc. the next closest polar side chain belongs to asp- <dig> in ecmnmc, which is  <dig>  Å away. therefore, asp- <dig> appears to be the most probable candidate for the lewis base responsible for activating the amino group of nm5u during the methyl transfer reaction. both aspartic acid residues are highly conserved based on multi sequence alignments of mnmc. asp- <dig> is invariant in both bifunctional and stand-alone mnmc <dig>  while asp- <dig> is conserved in  <dig> out of  <dig> bifunctional mnmcs and in  <dig> out of  <dig> stand-alone mnmc2s.

phe- <dig>  gly- <dig>  and gly- <dig> are invariant among  <dig> bifunctional mnmc. these amino acids contribute to the loop connecting β <dig> and α <dig>  which defines the binding surface for the amino acid portion of sam. in addition, the side chains of phe- <dig> and phe- <dig> contact the nucleoside segment of sam, shielding it from bulk solvent in the ecmnmc structure, although phe- <dig> is not visible due to disorder in ypmnmc structure. phe- <dig> is conserved as either phenylalanine or tyrosine and phe- <dig> is 97% conserved among bifunctional mnmc. importantly, these structures demonstrate that the reactive donor methyl group is solvent exposed and poised to accommodate the nucleophilic amine of nm5u <dig> .

structural comparison with mnmc <dig> of aquifex aeolicus
the crystal structure of mnmc <dig> from aquifex aeolicus  represents a stand-alone mnmc <dig> that is not fused to an mnmc <dig> domain  <cit> . sequence analysis shows that mnmc <dig> orthologs exist in a range of bacteria and archea, with most stand-alone mnmc2s being present in aquificaceae, cyanobacteria and proteobacteria. sequence alignments of aamnmc <dig> with ecmnmc <dig> and ypmnmc <dig> domains reveal sequence identities of 26% and 27%, respectively.

the overall fold of aamnmc <dig> is similar to that of the ecmnmc <dig> and ypmnmc <dig> domains, except for approximately  <dig> residues at the n-terminus and  <dig> residues in the c-terminus of aamnmc <dig> , which are not highly conserved among monofunctional mnmc <dig>  and the n-terminal ~ <dig> residues are absent in most mnmc <dig> orthologs . the rmsd of backbone carbon atoms  of the aamnmc <dig> domain with those of ecmnmc <dig>  and ypmnmc <dig> are  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å, respectively . in addition, the aforementioned critical beta sheet strand  that contributes to the interdomain interface in ecmnmc is absent in the structure of aamnmc <dig>  the major structural difference relative to ecmnmc and ypmnmc is in the c-terminal domain loop starting at ala- <dig>  which corresponds to the c-terminal residue of interdomain linker in ecmnmc . in aamnmc <dig>  this loop extends in a direction nearly opposite that of the linker in ecmnmc and completes a loop-helix-loop-helix motif, which is absent in the ecmnmc and ypmnmc structures. the n-terminal segment of aamnmc <dig> also exhibits distinct features, as it contributes residues that interact with the c-terminal segment .

the active site architecture of aamnmc <dig> is highly similar to that of ecmnmc and ypmnmc. glu- <dig> and asp- <dig>  which appear to be critical for sam binding and the methyl transfer reaction catalyzed by ecmnmc and ypmnmc, are also conserved in aamnmc <dig>  in addition, the highly conserved loop in bifunctional mnmc  is observed in an almost identical conformation, although gly- <dig> and phe- <dig> are somewhat variable among other monofunctional mnmc <dig> sequences . thus, despite the low sequence identity, bifunctional mnmc and stand-alone mnmc <dig> share remarkably similar active site configurations and catalytic strategies.

biological significance of bifunctional mnmc
mnmc and its corresponding associated trna modification are absent in most higher organisms including mammals, although cmnm5u <dig> is observed in several mitochondrial trnas of from saccharomyces cervisiae, ascaris suum, and tetrahymena thermophila <cit> . while 5-methylaminomethylation at the wobble uridine has been found in plants  as mnm5s2u <dig> in trnaglu <cit> , sequence analysis has failed to identify an mnmc ortholog in these organisms. however, identification of mnmc <dig> or mnmc <dig> may be difficult in some genomes given the significant sequence divergence exhibited by the methyl transferase and oxidoreductase superfamilies  <cit> . the structures of both ecmnmc and ypmnmc demonstrate that the two active sites are separated by ~ <dig> Å apart, with the mnmc <dig> and mnmc <dig> domains appearing to be rigidly fixed by a substantial interdomain interface that likely precludes direct interactions between mnmc <dig> and mnmc <dig> active sites. thus, if the present crystal structures represent the catalytically active conformation of mnmc, trna is likely released to the bulk solvent after oxidation at the mnmc <dig> active site in order to bind the mnmc <dig> active site for subsequent methylation.

there are a number of examples of bifunctional enzymes that utilize solvent protected molecular channels to shuttle intermediates between distant active sites  <cit> . such channeling process may minimize of the loss of metabolites, protect chemically labile intermediates, and orchestrate multiple sequential reactions  <cit> . this mechanism appears implausible for mnmc given the bulkiness of its trna substrates. another possibility is the induction of conformational rearrangements in mnmc, which brings the two active sites into close proximity. in this case, trna does not have to dissociate from the enzyme during turnover; however, given the apparent rigidity of the interdomain interface, this mechanism seems unlikely.

the occurrence of two active sites within a single polypeptide may prove beneficial in other contexts. the gene encoding a bifunctional enzyme is regulated by a single promoter, which provides a powerful constraint in situations where the coordinated expression of separate activities is required. in addition, the local concentrations of the two active sites are much higher if they are covalently tethered. however, it may not be necessary for mnmc to synchronize the two reactions it catalyzes. it has been shown that 5-aminomethyluridine  can be derived from the fusion of 5-formyluridine and ammonia by the mnme/mnmg complex in the absence of mnmc, both in vivo and in vitro <cit> . therefore, mnmc <dig> may be required to convert nm5u <dig> not originating from mnmc <dig>  consistent with this notion are recent kinetic studies demonstrating that the activities of the mnmc <dig> and mnmc <dig> domains are independent of one another  <cit> . the lack of coupling between the two active sites in bifunctional mnmc likely ensures comparable turn over of nm5u <dig> generated from either mnme/mnmg or mnmc <dig>  thus, the organization of bifunctional mnmc may have evolved to efficiently drive formation of the final desired product , regardless of the origin of nm5u <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
direct visualization of sam and fad in their respective domains defines their binding determinants and the overall organization of bifunctional mnmc. of particular importance, the structures of e. coli and y. pestis mnmc reveal evolutionarily conserved structural features around the active sites and interdomain interface that contribute to function.
