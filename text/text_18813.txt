BACKGROUND
sertoli cells secrete growth factors to regulate the proliferation and differentiation of germ cells and themselves  <cit> . one such factor is glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor , a distantly related member of the transforming growth factor-β  superfamily  <cit> . gdnf was first identified by its ability to support embryonic midbrain dopaminergic neurons in vitro  <cit> . one type of gdnf receptor complex is composed of a ligand-binding subunit, gfrα <dig>  which is a glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol -linked protein that may also be secreted, and a signal transducing subunit ret, a receptor tyrosine kinase  <cit> . gdnf-null mice have defects in their nervous system, lack ureters and kidneys, and die 1- <dig>  days after birth although their gonads seem normal  <cit> . gfrα1- and ret-null mice exhibit similar phenotypes as gdnf-null mice and die during the first postnatal day  <cit> . another gdnf receptor complex is composed of gfrα <dig> and the p <dig> isoform of neural cell adhesion molecule  <cit> . neural cell adhesion molecule -null mice are healthy and fertile although defects have been noticed in their nervous system  <cit> . the early death of gdnf-, gfrα1- and ret-null mice after birth prevents further investigation on the potential roles that gdnf may have during spermatogenesis.

the role of gdnf in spermatogenesis is demonstrated more clearly by gdnf+/- mice and by mice with gdnf specifically over-expressed in the testis  <cit> . although most gdnf+/- mice survive to adulthood and are fertile, spermatogenesis is disturbed in half of the seminiferous tubules because of spermatogonia reduction or depletion. testicular morphology of mice over-expressing gdnf is normal at birth. however, large type a spermatogonial clusters start to form 2- <dig> weeks later, resulting in germ cell apoptosis after puberty and non-metastatic tumors at one year of age. the proliferation and function of the sertoli cells in both types of mice seem to be unchanged. however, whether the trophic effect of gdnf on spermatogenesis is also mediated by its action on sertoli cells has not been addressed.

it was reported that gdnf stimulated the proliferation of post-natal day  <dig> rat sertoli cells in cultured testicular fragments in the presence of follicular stimulating hormone   <cit> . other reports have indicated that gdnf stimulated the mitosis of sertoli cells isolated from developing mouse gonads  <cit>  or neonatal mouse testis  <cit> . in mice, the mrnas of gdnf, gfrα <dig> and ret have been detected in urogenital ridges and testis before and after birth by in situ hybridization assays  <cit> , and a decrease in their expression was observed after the first post-natal week  <cit> . consistently, in rats, gdnf mrna expression increased until post-natal day  <dig>  and then declined during the second and third post-natal weeks, and was lowest in adult testis  <cit> . the expression of ncam was detected in fetal or immature sertoli cells and was downregulated in the rat testis during the maturation of sertoli cells  <cit> . however, the question about the expression of gfrα <dig>  ret and ncam in sertoli cells has not been conclusively addressed. in the present study, we demonstrated that gdnf stimulated the proliferation of cultured iscs from pup mice, and this effect was mediated by the ncam receptor subunit and the downstream erk1/ <dig> signaling pathway.

RESULTS
gdnf stimulates the proliferation of mouse iscs
highly purified isc cultures from 4-5-day-old mice were acquired through several passages of testicular cells, which were maintained in serum-free dmem/f <dig> medium. the sertoli cell-specific protein vimentin  <cit>  was detected by immunostaining to evaluate the purity of the culture. after immunocytochemical staining, the numbers of vimentin-positive cells and dapi stained nuclei were counted. as shown in figure 1a, more than 95%  of the cells were vimentin-positive sertoli cells.

to test whether gdnf affects the proliferation of iscs, gdnf  was added into the culture medium, and the proliferation of iscs was evaluated by brdu incorporation. the results demonstrated that gdnf could significantly stimulate the proliferation of the cultured iscs. while about 14% of iscs were brdu-positive in the control culture, the percentage of brdu-positive cells increased to 34% when cells were cultured in medium containing  <dig> ng/ml gdnf for  <dig> h . in contrast, there was no significant difference in the percentages of the brdu-positive cells between the gdnf treated and control groups of the tm <dig> cell line , an immortalized mouse sertoli cell line whose responsiveness to fsh stimulation was reduced  <cit> .

expression of gdnf receptor subunits in iscs and tm <dig> cells
the mrna and protein expression of gdnf receptor subunits gfrα <dig>  ret, and ncam were investigated by rt-pcr and western blotting assays, respectively. as shown in figure 2a, transcripts for gfrα <dig> and ncam but not ret were detected in either iscs or tm <dig> cells. transcripts of the sertoli cell marker gene clusterin   <cit>  was only detected in iscs but not in tm <dig> cells. to show that the absence of the ret transcript in iscs and tm <dig> cells was not a technical artifact, we detected its presence in the cultured spermatogonial stem cells   <cit>  . western blotting results showed that protein expression of these three receptor subunits followed the same pattern as their transcripts . again, the validity of the ret antibody was demonstrated by its recognition of the antigen in the sy5y neural cell line  <cit>  as shown in figure 2e.

ncam mediates the proliferation stimulating effect of gdnf on iscs
cultured iscs were pre-treated with a polyclonal human ncam antibody that was raised against the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids, and then treated with gdnf and pulse-labeled with brdu. after immunocytochemical staining, the numbers of brdu-positive cells and dapi stained nuclei were counted. as shown in figures 3a-c, the percentage of the brdu positive cells in the ncam antibody-treated group was significantly lower than that in the non-specific igg treated group. next, we knocked down the expression of ncam by sirnas that specifically targeted the ncam mrna, and tested whether the proliferation stimulation effect of gdnf on iscs could also be abolished. as shown by figures 3d-g, ncam mrna and protein expression in both iscs and tm <dig> cells were significantly reduced in the ncam sirna transfected group compared with the negative control sirna group. importantly, the proliferation stimulating effect of gdnf on iscs was significantly reduced in the ncam sirna transfected group compared with the negative control sirna group .

erk inhibitor pd <dig> abolishes gdnf induced isc proliferation
it has been reported that gdnf plays an essential role in regulating the self-renewal of sscs by activating the akt and erk1/ <dig> signaling pathways  <cit> . to identify the signaling pathways activated by gdnf in iscs, we first examined the phosphorylation levels of erk1/ <dig> and akt in iscs with and without gdnf treatment by western blotting assays. the results showed that the phosphorylation level of erk1/ <dig> was significantly up-regulated  <dig> min post-gdnf stimulation and reached its highest levels after  <dig> min . notably, the increase of gdnf-induced erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation was completely blocked by pre-treatment of iscs with the erk1/ <dig> inhibitor, pd <dig>  for  <dig> min . the basal levels of erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation were also down-regulated by pd <dig> treatment compared with the control group . in contrast, gdnf stimulation  or pd <dig> pre-treatment and gdnf stimulation  did not influence the phosphorylation level of akt in iscs. more importantly, pd <dig> pre-treatment completely abolished gdnf stimulated proliferation of iscs compared with the gdnf treatment group .

discussion
sertoli cells are the somatic cells in the testis that are essential for testis formation and spermatogenesis  <cit> . proliferation of iscs is important for male fertility because each sertoli cell is able to support a limited number of germ cells  <cit> . hormones such as fsh  <cit> , estrogen  <cit>  and thyroid hormones  <cit>  as well as various paracrine growth factors including insulin-like growth factors i and ii   <cit> , fibroblast growth factor  and somatomedin-c  <cit> , activin  <cit> , transforming growth factor-α   <cit> , and interleukin- <dig>  <cit>  are important in regulating the proliferation of iscs. gdnf, a protein remotely related to the tgf-β super family members, and its receptor components gfrα <dig>  ret and ncam have been reported to be expressed in several types of testicular cells, implying a role of gdnf signaling in spermatogenesis. the role of gdnf signaling in spermatogonial proliferation and differentiation has been unequivocally demonstrated by in vivo studies using gdnf+/- mice and mice with specific over-expression of gdnf in testis  <cit>  and by in vitro studies in which gdnf was indentified as an essential factor for spermatogonial stem cell culture  <cit> . however, the role of gdnf in sertoli cells is controversial. no sertoli cell abnormality was reported in gdnf+/- mice and mice with gdnf testis-specific over-expression while its stimulatory effect on the proliferation of sertoli cells was observed in cultured neonatal rat seminiferous tubules and in sertoli cells from fetal mouse testis  <cit> . in the present study, we used cultured iscs from neonatal mice to show that gdnf stimulates the proliferation of iscs derived from 4-5-day-old mice.

gfrα <dig> has been used as a specific surface marker for the identification and purification of mouse sscs in some studies  <cit> . however, in the present study, we detected gfrα <dig> expression in cultured iscs at both the mrna and protein levels. as indicated by the results of he et al.  <cit> , the protein level of gfrα <dig> in iscs seemed to be much lower than in sscs and was probably regarded as background signal in immunohistochemistry experiments by those authors. gdnf is known to signal through a multi-component receptor system consisting of gfrα <dig> and one of the two co-receptor subunits ret  <cit>  or ncam  <cit> . gfra <dig> is the main ligand binding subunit and therefore is indispensible for the function of the receptor complex. because the expression of ret was not detected in iscs both at the mrna and the protein levels, it is almost certain that the signal transduction is mediated by ncam. therefore, we focused on studying the role of ncam in mediating gdnf signaling in iscs although we could not fully exclude that additional or alternative receptors and pathways might also be involved in mediating the action of gdnf in iscs. the essential role of ncam in iscs was supported by results from both ncam antibody blocking and sirna knockdown experiments. the observation that mrna and protein of ncam but not ret were expressed in cultured iscs was consistent with one previous report  <cit> .

it has been reported that gdnf signaling through the phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> and akt mediated the self-renewal division and proliferation of sscs  <cit> . we observed in this study that gdnf stimulation also led to a rapid increase of erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation levels at thr202/tyr <dig> in cultured iscs, but akt phosphorylation levels did not change during this process. significantly, the increase in erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation and isc proliferation could be completely blocked by pd <dig>  with the phosphorylation level of akt not changing during this process, suggesting that gdnf signaled through the erk1/ <dig> pathway in iscs to execute its pro-proliferation function.

proliferation of tm <dig> cells was not stimulated by gdnf although they possessed the same set of gdnf receptor subunits as iscs. it is well known that tm <dig>  an immortalized sertoli cell line from mouse testis, has lost some characteristics of primary sertoli cells. for example, fsh responsiveness was reduced in tm <dig> cells compared with primary sertoli cell cultures  <cit> . we also noticed that clu, a sertoli cell marker, was not expressed by tm <dig> cells. therefore, it is possible that downstream components of the gdnf signaling pathways have been changed in tm <dig> cells during its conversion from a primary culture to an immortalized cell line. based on these characteristics of tm <dig>  we used it as a negative control for studying isc proliferation stimulated by gdnf in the present study. it will be instructive to elucidate the difference in gdnf signaling between iscs and tm <dig> cells in future studies as the results would explain why tm <dig> cells and iscs are different in response to gdnf treatment.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study demonstrated that gdnf stimulates the proliferation of cultured mouse iscs through its ncam receptor subunit and the consequent activation of the erk1/ <dig> signaling pathway.
