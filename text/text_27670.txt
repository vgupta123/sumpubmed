BACKGROUND
the innate immune responses are the first line of host defense against a virus infection. an important component of the intracellular antiviral response is mediated by the 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase /ribonuclease l  pathway. oas genes are interferon-inducible and activated by binding to double-stranded rna . dsrna, present in virus infected cells, activates oas proteins to catalyze the oligomerization of atp to form 2',5' -linked oligoadenylate chains n)  <cit> . originally discovered as a low molecular weight inhibitor of protein synthesis, pppan induces the activation of the latent endoribonuclease, rnase l, which degrades both cellular and viral rna in a non-preferential manner  <cit> . the oas/rnasel pathway has also been implicated in the induction of apoptosis  <cit> .

the murine flavivirus resistance gene, flv, was positionally cloned and identified as oas1b  <cit> . a cdna sequence comparison among susceptible and resistant strains of mice identified a single nucleotide substitution that causes a premature stop codon in the oas1b transcripts of susceptible mice  <cit> .

the human oas gene cluster, consisting of genes oas <dig>  oas <dig> and oas <dig>  is located on chromosome 12q <dig>   <cit> . the small synthetases are transcribed from the oas <dig> gene while the medium and large synthetases are encoded by the oas <dig> and oas <dig> genes, respectively. alternative splicing was previously reported in both oas <dig> and oas <dig> transcripts  <cit> . for example, the human oas <dig> transcript e <dig> corresponds to the p <dig> protein, which is translated from a  <dig>  kilobase  mrna, while the alternatively spliced e <dig> transcript encoding the p <dig> protein is about  <dig>  kb  <cit> . both p <dig> and p <dig> proteins are identical in their first  <dig> n-terminal amino acids but differ at the c-terminus  <cit> . variations in the human oas <dig> gene that may be relevant to the outcome of virus infections have been reported  <cit> .

the human rnasel gene maps to chromosome 1q <dig>  <cit> . the  <dig> amino acid,  <dig>  dalton protein is translated from a ~ <dig>  kb transcript  <cit> . the rnase l protein consists of three domains: 1) an n-terminal domain of ankyrin repeats with p-loop motifs between the seventh and eighth repeat, 2) a serine/threonine protein kinase domain, and 3) a c-terminal ribonuclease domain  <cit> . rnase l activation requires binding of a single 2-5a molecule to the n-terminal ankyrin repeats 2– <dig>  <cit> . 2-5a binding reverses the naturally repressive state of the rnase l ankyrin repeats, ultimately producing a functional homodimer with ribonuclease activity  <cit> .

previously, the equine oas gene cluster was mapped to horse  chromosome 8p <dig> and shown to have an organization similar to that in the human genome: oas1-oas3-oas <dig>  <cit> . two clones were identified from segment  <dig> of the chori- <dig> equine bac library, 77f <dig>  and 100i <dig> , that contain complete oas <dig> and oas <dig> sequences. bac clone 77f <dig> also contains nine 5'-terminal exons of oas <dig>  <cit> .

in this report, a subclone library generated from chori- <dig> bac 100i <dig> was sequenced and then used to construct a contig assembly spanning the oas <dig> gene. the equine rnasel gene was identified in multiple bac clones of the chori- <dig> library and was fish mapped on metaphase spreads to eca5p17-p <dig>  equine rnasel genomic sequence was obtained from bac clone 159n <dig> and an assembly similar to that for oas <dig> was constructed. full-length rnasel cdna from  <dig> species were determined and compared in a phylogenetic analysis. re-sequencing of genomic dna from multiple horses of different breeds identified a total of  <dig> snps and  <dig> microsatellites within the oas <dig> and rnasel genes.

RESULTS
bac 100i <dig> sequencing and oas <dig> contig assembly
a shotgun subclone library was constructed from sheared fragments of chori- <dig> bac 100i <dig>  nine hundred sub-clones were bi-directionally sequenced, resulting in  <dig>  bases with quality scores >  <dig>  providing  <dig> x coverage. the individual chromatogram files were analyzed by phred, phrap and consed  <cit>  and individual contigs were scaffolded on the human genome sequence using blast. the scaffold was further validated by the addition of multiple sequences from tracedb  <cit>  retrieved via blast searches using full length equine oas <dig> mrna . the scaffold contained four genomic contigs spanning a substantial part of the equine oas <dig> gene, including  <dig>  kb of promoter sequence upstream of exon  <dig> and  <dig>  kb of sequence downstream of exon  <dig>  and was submitted to genbank under accession number dq <dig>  the genomic assembly also included sequence for the downstream equine oas <dig> gene as well as an upstream gene orthologous to human rph3a . this assembly completely overlaps two whole genome shotgun sequences, aawr <dig>  and aawr <dig> , that were recently submitted to genbank from the broad institute.

identification of oas <dig> microsatellites
the genomic sequence assembly identified two microsatellites, one located within the promoter and the other downstream of exon  <dig>  the promoter gt-microsatellite is located  <dig> bp upstream of the atg translation initiation site. a shorter gt-microsatellite is in the same relative position in the human oas <dig> promoter and the flanking regions were well conserved between the two sequences . this microsatellite may affect the functions of flanking regulatory elements. sequencing the oas <dig> promoter regions of  <dig> horses established that this promoter microsatellite is polymorphic in length. the second polymorphic microsatellite was a gt-dinucleotide repeat located  <dig> bp downstream of exon  <dig> within the 3' utr. it has previously been reported that a 3' utr microsatellite can alter the level of synthesis of a mrna.  <cit> .

oas <dig> snp identification
the assembled oas <dig> scaffold was aligned to the full length,  <dig>  kb cdna equine transcript  to delineate individual exons and flanking intron sequences from the genomic contigs. genomic primers were designed within flanking intron sequences as well as for the proximal promoter .

forward and reverse primers for amplification of the oas <dig> promoter and individual exons of equine oas <dig> and rnasel.

sequence data obtained from the screening population and from chori bac 100i <dig> were analyzed using phred, phrap and consed programs  <cit> . both visual analysis of the chromatogram data to identify heterozygotes and computer analysis using the consed visualization tool identified  <dig> single nucleotide substitutions within the proximal promoter and exons of oas <dig> . of these,  <dig> were within coding regions,  <dig> within non-coding regions and the remaining  <dig> within the proximal promoter upstream of exon  <dig>  four of the  <dig> non-coding polymorphisms were located within the 5' and 3' untranslated regions . of the  <dig> coding polymorphisms,  <dig> were synonymous and  <dig> were non-synonymous. five of the  <dig> non-synonymous snps resulted in substitutions of amino acids with different properties. interestingly, the amino acids encoded by the major alleles of  <dig> of the  <dig> non-synonymous mutations were identical to the corresponding amino acids in the human oas <dig> protein . the genotypes of each individual were used to identify potential haplotypes within equine oas <dig> using phase v <dig>  software  <cit> . only those snps verified within multiple individuals were used for the haplotype analysis . the best reconstruction produced  <dig> haplotypes from the  <dig> diallelic snps . the polymorphic microsatellites were not included in the analysis.

snps and microsatellites identified from sequencing the oas <dig> proximal promoter and exons from  <dig> equine individuals and chori bac 100i <dig>  positions are identified from the genomic consensus sequence submitted to genbank .

haplotypes were assembled using phase v <dig>   <cit>  under default settings. the haplotypes identified from the best reconstruction are shown with their corresponding frequencies among the  <dig> horses screened for both oas <dig> and rnasel snps. both oas <dig> microsatellites were omitted from the haplotype reconstruction.

assembling full-length rnasel mrna sequences of cattle, dog, horse, cat, domestic pig, guinea pig, elephant and opossum
a limited number of mammalian rnasel mrna sequences were previously deposited to genbank and some of these sequences were predicted from whole genome annotations. however, this genbank information was not sufficient to identify evolutionarily conserved regions in mammalian rnasel sequences that could be used to design pcr primers to amplify equine rnasel fragments. the predicted sequences of cattle  and dog  rnasel orfs were amplified from commercial cdna , directly sequenced and extended to full-length cdna sequences by dna walking. the full-length cattle and dog rnasel sequences were submitted to genbank under accession numbers dq <dig> and dq <dig>  respectively. these two sequences as well as the human full-length rnasel sequence nm_ <dig> were aligned and degenerate primers were designed from conserved regions  and used to amplify the middle portions of equine rnasel cdna. this partial sequence was extended to the full-length sequence by dna walking and submitted to genbank under accession number dq <dig> 

primers used to assemble the full-length rnasel mrna sequences of cattle, dog, horse, cat, domestic pig, guinea pig, elephant and opossum.

several additional mammalian rnasel sequences were also determined and subsequently used to perform a phylogenetic analysis. the genbank feline whole genome sequence  database was searched with the canine rnasel sequence . four genomic contigs, aang <dig>  aang <dig>  aang <dig> and aang <dig>  were detected. these contigs contain the first, second and third, as well as the fifth and sixth feline rnasel coding exons, respectively. no contigs containing the fourth coding exon of the feline rnasel gene were found in genbank. two primers were designed based on the 3'- end aang <dig> sequence and the 5'-end aang <dig> sequence  and used to amplify and sequence this region from a commercial cat genomic dna . the sequence of this exon was submitted to genbank under accession number ef <dig>  using this sequence as well as the other exon sequences derived from genbank , the predicted full-length mrna sequence of the feline rnasel gene was assembled.

the tigr porcine database  <cit>  was searched using the cattle sequence  and five partial rnasel sequences were found. the tc <dig> and tc <dig> sequences correspond to the 5'-end of porcine rnasel mrna, while the tc <dig>  tc <dig>  and tc <dig> sequences represent the 3'-end. an additional 5'-end cdna sequence, 20060611s- <dig>  was detected in the pig est data explorer  <cit> . a pair of primers were designed based on the partial sequence  and used to amplify pooled cdna . the middle portions of the porcine rnasel cdna were directly sequenced. the partial sequence was then extended to the full-length sequence by dna walking and submitted to genbank under accession number dq <dig> 

the genbank guinea pig whole genome sequence database was searched using both mouse  and rat  full-length rnasel sequences. two guinea pig sequences, aakn <dig> and aakn <dig>  showed significant similarity to the 5' and 3' regions of the rodent rnasel sequences, respectively. these two sequences were used to design primers  to amplify commercial cdna  and directly sequence the middle portions of guinea pig rnasel cdna. this partial sequence was extended to the full-length sequence by dna walking, and submitted to genbank under accession number dq <dig> 

cattle, dog, horse and pig rnasel sequences were used to search the genbank elephant genome trace archive using the discontiguous mega blast program. the same sequences were also used to search the genbank elephant whole genome sequence database using the blastn program. the sequences for all potential exons of the elephant rnasel gene were identified. based on these sequences, five primer pairs  were designed to amplify genomic dna  and directly sequence each of the elephant rnasel exons. the resulting sequence was submitted to genbank under accession number dq <dig> 

the rnasel orf sequence of the laboratory opossum  was predicted by searching the ucsc genome browser  <cit>  using the blat program. no sequence traces similar to rnasel were detected in frog  or several fish species .

phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate rnasel gene sequences
only sequences of human and mouse rnasel genes were previously reported  <cit> . sequences of orthologous rat  and chicken  genes were recently submitted to genbank but have not been reported in any publications. in addition, annotations of chimpanzee, orangutan and rhesus macaque genomes using a gnomon method resulted in predicted rnasel sequences in these three species. primate, rodent and avian rnasel sequences were downloaded from genbank and aligned to orthologous sequences described above to build a phylogenetic tree . rodents showed the highest rate of nucleotide substitutions, while primates showed the lowest rate of evolution. evolution rates were found to be fairly uniform in the three different rnase l domains: ankyrin repeats, serine/threonine protein kinase domain, and ribonuclease domain. the percent identity between the rnasel orfs of horse and the other species compared is shown in table  <dig> 

assignment of the rnasel gene to horse chromosome eca5p17-p16
the horse chori- <dig> bac library was searched with a probe derived from the partial equine rnasel cdna fragment. twelve positive clones were identified and two of them, 108p <dig> and 189i <dig>  were fish mapped to assign the rnasel gene to the horse chromosomal location eca5p17-p <dig> .

exon/intron structures of vertebrate rnasel genes
partial sequence for the equine rnasel gene was obtained by sequencing pcr fragments of bac 159n <dig>  the mrna sequence  was used as a reference for determining intron/exon junctions. sufficient genomic sequence was obtained to build a scaffold as described for the equine oas <dig> gene. the scaffold was verified using sequences from tracedb  <cit>  and submitted to genbank under accession number ef <dig>  this scaffold completely overlaps the whole genome shotgun sequence aawr <dig>  that was recently submitted to genbank from the broad institute. comparison of genomic and mrna sequences revealed six coding and one 5'-terminal non-coding exon in the equine rnasel gene. this exonic composition is similar to that of a number of other mammalian rnasel genes. however, two and three 5'-terminal non-coding exons were found in the chicken and mouse rnasel genes, respectively. the coding vertebrate rnasel exons were designated a through f. comparison of the genomic and mrna sequences of vertebrate rnasel genes revealed significant length variation in both the 5'-  and 3'-terminal  coding exons .

snp identification in the horse rnasel gene
after identification of the equine rnasel introns, exon-specific genomic primers were designed . exon-specific sequencing of dna from the screening population identified  <dig> snps within the rnasel gene . of the  <dig> non-coding polymorphisms, one was within the second intron and the others were located in the 5' and 3' utrs. seventeen of the  <dig> snps were located within the ankyrin repeat-encoding exon  <dig>   <dig> of which are non-synonymous, with  <dig> resulting in substitutions of amino acids with different properties. three non-synonymous polymorphisms were identified within exons  <dig> and  <dig>  the remaining exons, including the non-coding exon  <dig> were invariant among these horses. the amino acids encoded by the major allele of  <dig> of the  <dig> non-synonymous mutations were identical to the corresponding human rnase l amino acid . using motif search  <cit>  to identify putative transcription factor binding motifs in the transfac database, the promoter snp was found to be located within a potential camp-response element binding site  upstream of the first exon. haplotypes were assembled in the same manner as for the equine oas <dig> gene. the best reconstruction from phase analysis produced  <dig> haplotypes among the  <dig> verified diallelic snps with minor allele frequencies =  <dig>  . as with oas <dig>  only good quality, unambiguous resequencing data were used for the haplotype analysis.

snps identified from sequencing rnasel exons from  <dig> equine individuals, chori bac 159n <dig> and the reference transcript sequence. positions are identified from the genomic consensus sequence submitted to genbank .

identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms by sequencing dna from multiple individuals enhances the possibility of artifacts either from pcr or sequencing error. the  <dig> snps identified from the equine oas <dig> and rnasel genes were considered valid if each allele was identified in at least two individuals. eight additional snps were identified but could not be verified in more than one individual . within the  <dig>  and  <dig>  base pairs re-sequenced during the snp identification for oas <dig> and rnasel, respectively, equine oas <dig> contained an average of one polymorphism per  <dig> bases, while equine rnasel averaged one polymorphism per  <dig> bases.

discussion
sequence characterization of the horse oas <dig> gene in chori- <dig> bac 100i <dig> enabled a partial genomic sequence assembly  and comparison among multiple equine individuals. we identified  <dig> polymorphic microsatellites and  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms from a group of  <dig> individuals and chori- <dig> bac 100i <dig> . in an attempt to identify potential structural and/or functional consequences of the coding non-synonymous snps, each was analyzed using polyphen software  <cit> . each polymorphic variant identified in equine oas <dig> was predicted to cause benign effects at their respective residue position. however, the single mutation resulting in an arg209cys substitution may significantly change oas <dig> enzymatic activity. arg <dig> in the equine oas <dig> protein corresponds to arg <dig> in the human oas <dig> protein, which is located in the donor binding domain. substitution of arg <dig> with either ala or tyr significantly decreased enzymatic activity of the oas <dig> protein  <cit> . in addition, the equine oas <dig> promoter snp at position  <dig> is located in an interferon stimulating response element  <cit> . inactivation of this regulatory element by a single nucleotide substitution may alter expression of the equine oas <dig> gene.

rnasel enzymatic activity was previously reported in reptiles, birds, and mammals  <cit> . however, no rnasel genes have been found for amphibians or fishes to date. interestingly, the same classes of vertebrates also do not have oas genes <cit> .

the horse rnasel gene was fish mapped to chromosomal location eca5p17-p <dig>  orthologous genes are located on primate chromosome  <dig> , cattle chromosome  <dig>  dog chromosome  <dig>  mouse chromosome  <dig>  rat chromosome  <dig> and chicken chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . using comparative chromosome painting , similarities between human chromosome  <dig> and horse chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , mouse chromosome  <dig>  rat chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , dog chromosome  <dig>  <cit>  and cattle chromosome  <dig>  <cit>  were previously established. our results further confirm the conservation of rnasel-containing syntenic chromosomal segments in horses.

thirty one snps were identified for equine rnasel . interestingly, all but three of the  <dig> coding snps identified are located within exon  <dig>  the rnase l protein contains  <dig> n-terminal ankyrin repeats responsible for binding 2-5a molecules that are essential for activation  <cit> . exon  <dig> of the human rnasel gene encodes the entire ankyrin repeat region . the high frequency of non-synonymous polymorphisms within exon  <dig> suggests that a single snp or haplotype could ablate 2-5a binding and/or other rnase l interactions. as well, the snp identified within the promoter upstream of the first exon is located within a potential camp-response element binding site. mutations within this promoter element have been shown to affect gene expression  <cit> . polyphen analysis was also conducted on the non-synonymous coding snps identified within equine rnasel. all but  <dig> of the rnase l snps were predicted to have benign effects. however, the snp at residue  <dig> was predicted to change hydrophobicity at a buried site within the rnase l protein and the effect of this on protein function is unknown. the predictions provided by polyphen analysis are based on functional effects identified using human nssnps and may differ for the horse rnase l. four snps within the ankyrin repeat region in exon  <dig>  were predicted to have a negative effect on function. these data support our hypothesis that a single snp or haplotype could affect 2-5a binding within the equine rnase l ankyrin repeats.

a number of snps were detected within the 3'utr region of the equine rnasel gene. of the eight snps found within this region, six result in transitions. the 3'utr regions of mrnas contain regulatory regions capable of protein and microrna binding that control mrna stability, translation and localization. a simple analysis of octamer motifs containing equine 3' utr snps identified snp  <dig> as being within a human mirna target site  <cit> . if this target site is conserved in horses, this snp could significantly affect the synthesis of rnase l. however, this particular octamer motif was not found in human or rodent rnasel 3'utrs. furthermore, cross-species sequence comparison using mvista <cit>  also revealed no significant longer range conservation in this region between species .

genotype analysis using phase v <dig>   <cit>  identified  <dig> and  <dig> haplotypes among equine oas <dig> and rnasel genes, respectively, and suggested the existence of haplotype blocks spanning most of each gene . even if efforts to show an association between viral-induced disease susceptibility and oas <dig> and/or rnasel snps are successful, it may prove difficult to unambiguously identify a single causal snp because of potential linkage disequilibrium at these loci. as determined from our screening population, a single haplotype occurred more frequently than any other, with a frequency of  <dig>  and  <dig>  in oas <dig> and rnasel, respectively .

the frequency of snp identification in this study in two equine genes was high considering the previously estimated equine snp frequency of  <dig> per  <dig> bp  <cit> . in dogs, the estimated snp rate is ~ <dig> per  <dig> bp , but a higher frequency of ~ <dig> per  <dig> bp was estimated between breeds  <cit> . re-sequencing of specific genes in several breeds of the domestic dog identified polymorphisms at frequencies comparable to our estimates, with  <dig> snp per ~250– <dig> bp . furthermore, re-sequencing within an elk  putative promoter region, which is highly conserved between mule deer, cow and sheep, detected an average snp frequency of  <dig> per  <dig> bp .

the microsatellite identified within the promoter region in this study may also alter expression of the equine oas <dig> gene. the alleles observed to date indicate that dinucleotide repeat lengths of  <dig> and  <dig> may represent the major alleles at this locus. the over-representation of these alleles may be due to the fact that they correspond to one complete rotation of the dna helix. if this microsatellite separates cis-regulatory elements, alterations in its length could affect the binding of transcriptional regulators to these elements and significantly alter gene expression  <cit> . in support of this hypothesis, there is a high degree of conservation between human and horse oas <dig> promoters in the regions flanking the microsatellite . as well, recent micro-array data provide evidence of an inverse relationship between gene expression and dinucleotide microsatellite length, supporting the significantly higher frequency with which we identified the  <dig> allele within the individuals screened <cit> 

CONCLUSIONS
we report the genomic sequences of the equine oas <dig> and rnasel genes and identify  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms and  <dig> polymorphic microsatellites in these genes. on the basis of the allelic variants characterized, we conclude that a number of these are plausible candidates for regulatory or structural mutations which may influence transcription or enzymatic activity of oas <dig> and rnase l proteins. also, rnasel cdna sequences were determined for  <dig> mammals and utilized in a phylogenetic analysis. the chromosomal location of the rnasel gene was assigned by fish to eca5p17-p <dig>
