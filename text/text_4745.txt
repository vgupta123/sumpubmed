BACKGROUND
typing by dna fingerprinting is a common tool used in bacterial biogeography and epidemiology studies. several bacterial species can be differentiated in clonal lines associated to specific animal hosts  <cit> . single genetic differences between clonal lineages could be useful to determine the history of an infection or to find new possible borderline strains  <cit> . similarly, fingerprinting methods are frequently used to evaluate the global dispersal of environmentally relevant microbial species or lineages in a species  <cit> , to correlate specific genotypes to a given environmental conditions  <cit>  and to evaluate the endemicity of a given microbial type  <cit> .

different dna-based typing methodologies are now available and box-pcr is the most commonly used technique due to its simplicity, efficiency and low cost. this is a particular version of repetitive extragenic palindromic-pcr   <cit>  that uses the box-a1r primer  <cit> . box-pcr is a fingerprinting analysis based on the box dispersed-repeat motif, firstly identified in streptococcus pneumoniae, but common in a number of bacterial species  <cit> . since the box repetitive sequences are interspersed throughout the genome, box-pcr is a method potentially capable of simultaneously surveying many dna regions scattered in the bacterial genome. it has been shown to have similar or even better strain differentiation power, as well as to be easier to perform, than ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis , restriction fragment length polymorphism , amplified fragment length polymorphism , random amplified polymorphic dna  and other techniques  <cit> . box-pcr is quicker, cheaper, and in many cases more discriminatory than pulsed field gel electrophoresis   <cit> , despite is generally less reproducible. box-pcr patterns are not affected by the culture age of the strain to be analyzed  <cit>  and fingerprinting output can be easily analyzed by computer assisted methods  <cit> . these features make box-pcr a frequently used tool in biogeography studies in environmental microbiology  <cit> .

the current box-pcr technique, in which the amplified products are separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, suffers from several limitations like poor band resolution and run standardization for comparison of the different profiles in different gels. to overcome these limitations separation of fluorescent labelled products in automated dna sequencer can be used  <cit> , but this interesting improvement has been applied rarely in environmental analysis and limited to machines performing separation in long polyacrylamide gels  <cit> .

in this study we show that fluorescent box-pcr , in which the separation of pcr products is performed in an abi-prism  <dig> capillary electrophoresis system, is capable of resolving endemicity and the biogeographical repartition of different bacterial populations. we first assessed suitability and reproducibility of different electrophoretic runs of different f-box-pcr reactions prepared from independent extractions of dna from eight bacterial strains exhibiting different g+c content. the power of f-box-pcr in resolving bacterial endemicity was assessed on a collection of modestobacter multiseptatus strains isolated from three different microsites of an altered ancient carbonatic wall in the old city of cagliari, sardinia, italy  <cit> . biogeographic segregation of different bacterial populations was tested on a collection of  <dig> strains of streptococcus thermophilus isolated from the caucasian home-made yogurt-like product matsoni produced in different areas of the georgian caucasus  <cit> .

RESULTS
reproducibility of box-pcr and f-box-pcr in agarose gels
the reproducibility of box-pcr and f-box-pcr in agarose gels was analyzed using strains belonging to different taxa with very diverse g+c content. we chose six strains of geodermatophilaceae  belonging the genera blastococcus and modestobacter, one strain of e. coli  and one strain of b. cereus . the six strains of geodermatophilaceae were chosen on the basis of their box-pcr patterns in agarose gel that should cover a wide size range. strain ds <dig> had a box-pcr pattern with a relatively small range of fragment length between  <dig> and  <dig> bp. strains ci1- <dig> and co2- <dig> showed box-pcr patterns with a wider range of fragment length, between  <dig> and about  <dig> bp and between  <dig> and about  <dig> bp respectively. strains ci2- <dig>  ci2- <dig> and ci2- <dig> were also analyzed since they had very similar patterns.

the average number of fragments found with box-pcr varied between  <dig>   and  <dig>   with relatively high standard deviations  between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . number of bands could be variable among replicates from independent dna extractions, pcr or agarose gels: for example, b. cereus box-pcr patterns were represented by  <dig> to  <dig> fragments, strain ci2- <dig> pattern varied between  <dig> and  <dig> fragments, while e. coli pattern showed  <dig> to  <dig> bands.

reproducibility of box-pcr profiles, obtained from different dna extractions and different runs in agarose gels, is shown in table  <dig> and it is expressed as jaccard's similarity coefficient between replicates. examples of box-pcr profiles are shown in figure  <dig>  reproducibility of results with standard box-pcr was affected by dna extraction , pcr amplification  and gel separation . the overall similarity calculated for all replicates was of  <dig>  ±  <dig> %. similarity values were occasionally quite low, as in the case of b. cereus which showed only  <dig> % of similarities between pcr replicates and an overall similarity of  <dig> %. the low reproducibility is attributable to the low number of bands for this strain. box-pcr patterns were seldom richer than 15– <dig> bands and some of these bands were weak . a delicate step of box-pcr analysis is the gel staining with ethidium bromide and uv acquisition especially of weak bands. a disappearance of one band in a profile of  <dig> bands decreases the similarity of two identical profiles by 10%. in the case of b. cereus, the average number of bands was only  <dig>  and the absence of a weak band between two replicates affects the similarity by 15%.

polyacrylamide gels and silver staining gives better resolution of fragments with respect to agarose gel electrophoresis but is labour-intensive and can suffer a relatively low reproducibility due to the gel staining procedures. however it would be worth investigating the convenience of applying polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for analysis of box-pcr patterns in comparison with f-box-pcr in terms of economic costs, time required in sample handling and overall reproducibility.

for all the strains that were tested, the use of box-a1r primer labelled with fluorescent chromophores affected the box-pcr profiles in agarose gel by decreasing the number of detectable bands ; in case of b. cereus only one band was often visible for both hex and 6-fam labelled primers. band pattern modifications were also noted in denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis  for products labelled with 6-fam dye in comparison with those non labelled  <cit> . computer-assisted analysis of agarose gel electrophoresis showed that patterns obtained with 6-fam labelled primer were generally richer in bands than those obtained with the fluorophore hex . a similar result was observed by ranjard and collaborators  <cit> , who found 6-fam primers giving the best total peak intensity in automated rrna intergenic spacer analysis .

reproducibility of capillary electrophoresis
the f-box-pcr products labelled with hex and 6-fam were run twice in capillary electrophoresis. for all the strains tested, peak number obtained by using 6-fam was significantly higher than dna band numbers in agarose gel profiles obtained by box-pcr  and 6-fam-based f-box-pcr. 6-fam peak profiles were confirmed to be generally richer than hex patterns . the average number of peaks varied between  <dig>   and  <dig>   with very low relative standard deviations . altogether, f-box-pcr gave more informative patterns  than box-pcr, indicating that capillary electrophoresis detects at least two times more peaks than agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. 6-fam was more informative than hex when comparing these f-box-pcrs with standard box-pcr . the richness of 6-fam-based profiles is evident in figure  <dig>  in which an example of run for each strain tested is shown. profiles were well characterized by a number of high, medium and above all, small peaks that were sometimes very important. for example in the profile of b. cereus  <dig>  three high peaks were visible , while other  <dig> were smaller than  <dig> units of fluorescence. the peak patterns of strains ci2- <dig>  ci2- <dig> and ci2- <dig> were very similar with an average number of peaks of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the comparison with their profiles in agarose gel amplified with the box-a1r primer  showed how the fluorescent system could reveal much more amplicons than the traditional agarose gel.

a the comparison between box-pcr analysis and f-box-pcr analysis separated in agarose gel electrophoresis or in capillary electrophoresis was done considering eight strains belonging to b. cereus , to the family geodermatophilaceae  and to e. coli . the analysis was done in duplicate considering two independent dna extractions , two independent pcr amplifications  and two independent agarose gel runs or sample injection in the sequencer

since run characteristics along a capillary are nonlinear and most commercial size standards can present double peaks, there are greater uncertainties in sizing large dna fragments. the local southern sizing method of genescan software may improve the fragment sizing, generating the best-fit sizing curve. the software gives size in base pairs as a function of migration time of standard fragments. in our replicates we observed that up to  <dig> bp the precision of separation in all samples was close to ±  <dig>  bp, but over that, size precision constantly decreased reaching ±  <dig> bp at  <dig> bp, ±  <dig> bp at  <dig> and ±  <dig> bp at  <dig> bp. over  <dig> bp, the capability of separation of the  <dig> cm-capillary provided with pop <dig> polymer is reduced heavily appreciably affecting the sizing process with peak size discrepancy of ±  <dig> bp between replicated samples. over  <dig> bp, base peaks became wider and tended to merge as it can be noted in e. coli . however, the precision of the region between  <dig> and  <dig> bp in perfect conditions of run can be acceptable in comparison with agarose or polyacrylamide gels, since the seven peaks at 1700– <dig> bp of the similar strains ci2- <dig>  ci2- <dig> and ci2- <dig> can be easily aligned manually . the problem of the discrepancy in sizing large fragments is reflected in the set up of the data matrix due to the size calling precision . this uncertainty may cause f-box-pcr to appear less similar to each other, caused by splitting of peaks between adjacent combination windows  <cit> . sizing interpolation of large peaks beyond  <dig> bp could be improved by an improvement of polymers used in fragment separation or in innovative downstream matrix analysis. in spite of these uncertainties, the overall percentage of similarity of replicated analyses for 6-fam-based f-box-pcr was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % . as observed for agarose gels, the reproducibility of the technique is mainly affected by different dna extractions and by different pcr amplifications than by capillary separation .

f-box-pcr typing of m. multiseptatus from different stone microsites
we used f-box-pcr for analyzing bacterial endemisms on the surface of three microsites of a highly biodeteriored calcarenite stone characterized by a relatively high rate of erosion due to rainwater, saltiness and wind. we previously found that this stone was heavily colonized by actinobacteria of the family geodermatophilaceae, but typing with standard box-pcr failed to find clear relation between isolates and the microsites where they came from  <cit>  despite these microsites were characterized by different colours and types of alterations .

we compared f-box-pcr with box-pcr, by analyzing with the two methods,  <dig> strains of m. multiseptatus isolated from the surface of three different microsites on the stones . the number of bands detected by box-pcr were between  <dig>  and  <dig>  with an average of  <dig> . band size was between  <dig> and  <dig> bp. upgma tree failed to clearly cluster strains on the basis of the microsite of isolation . the similarity of groups was between  <dig> and 70%. the comparison between the cophenetic similarity matrix and the original similarity matrix done with the mantel's test gave a product-moment correlation of  <dig> , a very low fit value that do not make upgma output significant. f-box-pcr of these strains gave between  <dig>  and  <dig>  peaks with an average of  <dig> . peak size was between  <dig> and  <dig> bp. the average height of the peaks was  <dig> units of fluorescence. strains were grouped in the upgma tree according to the microsite of isolation . strains isolated from microsite a clustered in groups a and b, with an overall similarity of 11%. strains from microsite c were segregated in cluster e with most of the strains with a similarity of 9% and cluster f including strains cag <dig> and cag <dig> with a similarity of 38%. strains of microsite d clustered in one group  with 14% similarity, while strain ds <dig>  although in relation with cluster d, appeared to be separated. the coefficients of similarity were lower than the box-pcr tree due to the number of peaks,  <dig>  times higher than bands in the agarose gels. a very high product-moment correlation  characterized f-box-pcr tree. since clusters of figure 3b were constituted by strains of homogeneous microsite origin, pearson's correlation between sample location and genomic clusters shown in upgma tree was  <dig> .

f-box-pcr typing of s. thermophilus isolates from different source in georgia
for evaluating if f-box-pcr can discriminate bacterial population on a geographical scale, the bacterial diversity of  <dig> strains of s. thermophilus isolated from the georgian yoghurt matsoni  <cit>  produced in  <dig> different farms was studied .

 <dig> four geographical areas were defined according to longitude and altitude of the sampling places. the black sea area  includes farms located on the coast between longitudes 41° <dig> e and 42° <dig> e. the west georgia area  includes farms between longitudes 42° <dig> e and 43° <dig> e. the tbilisi area  includes farms between 44° <dig> e and 45° <dig> e. the mountain area  includes farms in a wide range of longitudes , which having in common an altitude higher than  <dig> m.

the number of bands detected by box-pcr were between  <dig>  and  <dig>  with an average of  <dig>  bands and size was between  <dig> and  <dig> bp. although some homogeneous groups were detectable in upgma tree , cluster analysis failed to clearly group strains on the basis of the geographical origin of matsoni . the similarity of groups was between  <dig> and 100%. five clusters included strains with identical box-pcr patterns, although strains were isolated from different regions in georgia. comparison between the cophenetic similarity matrix and the original similarity matrix done with the mantel's test gave a product-moment correlation of  <dig> , a very high fit value related to the relative low number of bands in the agarose gel and the high number of identical patterns.

f-box-pcr of the same strains gave between  <dig>  and  <dig>  peaks with an average of  <dig>  and sizes between  <dig> and  <dig> bp. the average peak height was  <dig> fluorescence units. the similarity coefficients were lower than the box-pcr tree  as observed with the previous analysis of m. multiseptatus, but it is explained by the number of peaks three times higher than the bands in the agarose gel. f-box-pcr did not produce identical patterns among the strains, hence the diversity in the peak matrix increased. for this reason, although the product-moment correlation of f-box-pcr tree was lower than in the agarose gel-derived upgma tree , the fit of the analysis is still positive.

f-box-pcr clustered s. thermophilus strains in the upgma dendrogram according to the geographical origin of the product from which they were isolated . most of the strains isolated from western georgia were clustered in two groups  with similarity of 54%  and 46% . within group a, it is placed strain  <dig> from mtskaldidi, a place relatively close to senaki area. cluster c includes with a similarity of 56% two subclusters  with an average similarity of about 70%. strains from the black sea coast  were grouped into c <dig>  with two strains isolated from inner western georgia . subcluster c <dig> was mainly formed by strains isolated in the surrounding area of tbilisi , plus strain  <dig> isolated in batumi. cluster d was formed by strains collected from various farms located in the mountain area of central georgia. the remaining strains were grouped in two groups  characterized by an overall homogeneous geographical origin, although group f had a low strain similarity . detrended principal coordinate analysis was used to cluster upgma groups defined by f-box-pcr with ecotypes determined from the geographical characteristics of sampling site . the resulting plot, representing the  <dig> % of the total inertia, confirmed the correlation found in the upgma tree. for example, clusters c <dig> and e were close to the tbilisi area , as expected, since they were mostly formed by strains isolated from that region. strong relationships were also found for groups a and b according to the western origin of their samples , for c <dig> including strains originating from the black sea coast  and, partially, for d, including isolates from the mountain area .

CONCLUSIONS
our study showed that a bacterial dna fingerprinting technique that use automated procedures for dna fragment separation could be an advantageous methodology to type and track microbial isolates and define endemisms in homogeneous environments where differential pressure is exerted by secondary  environmental factors. in the case of m. multiseptatus, while standard box-pcr failed to find a clear strain clustering on the basis of sampling site  <cit> , f-box-pcr gave a very well defined grouping with a clear relation with the microsite of isolation. this indicated that the technique can highlight endemisms in epilytic/endolytic environments, despite the environmental factors driving this endemism remain unknown and are still to be explored. in case of s. thermophilus, our data showed that f-box-pcr succeeded in defining a relation of strain types with the area of isolation, evidencing a geographical specificity. despite the relative easiness, automated fingerprinting analysis is not yet much used in the industrial system, although the final output can be analyzed by rapid, efficient and computerized analyses. f-box-pcr can prove as an advantageous tool to routinely depict microbial communities, for instance, for typing isolates in food industry or in traditional and regional  <cit>  dairy products. f-box-pcr, coupled with other well-known automated techniques, could help in labelling food products with the p.d.o.  and monitoring the related production chain. for example, f-box-pcr could be applied in parallel to length heterogeneity-pcr that was recently proposed as a rapid and precise method to characterise the lactic acid bacteria present in natural whey starters for the p.d.o. grana padano cheese and in maize silage  <cit> .
