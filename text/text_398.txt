BACKGROUND
modeling of protein structure is a central challenge in structural bioinformatics, and holds the promise not only to identify classes of structure, but also to provide detailed information about the specific structure and biological function of molecules. this is critically important to guide and understand experimental studies: it enables prediction of binding, simulation, and design for a huge set of proteins whose structures have not yet been determined experimentally , and it is a central part of contemporary drug development.

the accuracy of protein structure prediction has increased tremendously over the last decade, and today it is frequently possible to build models with 2-3Å resolution even when there are only distantly related templates available. however, as protein structure prediction has matured and become common in applications, the biggest challenge is typically not the overall average accuracy of a prediction method, but rather how accurate a specific model of a specific protein is. –is it worth spending months of additional human work, modeling and simulation time on this model? ranking or scoring of models has long been used to select the best predictions in methods, but this challenge means there is also a direct need for absolute quality prediction, e.g. the probability of a certain region of the protein being within 3Å of a correct structure.

one of the most common prediction approaches in use today is to produce many alternative models, either from different alignments and templates  <cit>  or by sampling different regions of the conformational space  <cit> . given this set of models, some kind of scoring function is then used to rank the different models based on their structural properties. ideally, this scoring function should correlate perfectly with the distance from the native structure. in practice, while they have improved, ranking methods are still not able to consistently place the best models at the top. in fact, it is often the case that models of higher or even much higher quality than the one selected are already available in the set of predictions, but simply missed  <cit> . in other words, many prediction methods are able to generate quite good models, but we are not yet able to identify them as such! in principle, there are three classes of functions to score protein models. the first of them is single-model methods that only use information from the actual model, such as evolutionary information  <cit> , residue environment compatibility  <cit> , statistical potentials from physics  <cit>  or knowledge-based ones  <cit> , or combinations of different structural features  <cit> . the second class is consensus methods that primarily use consensus of multiple models  <cit>  or template alignments  <cit>  for a given sequence to pick the most probable model. finally, there are also hybrid methods that combine the single-model and consensus approaches to achieve improved performance  <cit> . of the above methods, it is only the single-model methods that can be used for conformational sampling and as a guide for refinement since they are strict functions of the atomic positions in the model. on the other hand, in terms of accuracy the consensus and hybrid methods outperform the single methods, in particular in benchmarks such as casp  <cit>  with access to many alternative models for all different targets. the success of the consensus methods in casp has resulted in an almost complete lack of development of new true single-model methods. as a consequence only  <dig> out of  <dig> methods submitting predictions to both the global and local categories in the model quality assessment part of the latest casp were actual true single-model methods  <cit> . by true, we mean methods that can be used for conformational sampling and that do not use any template information in the scoring of models.

scoring of models can be performed at different levels, either locally  or globally to reflect the overall properties of a model. traditionally, the focus of most scoring functions has been to discriminate between globally incorrect and approximately correct models, which works reasonably well e.g. for picking the model that provides the best average structure for a complete protein . in contrast, only a handful of methods focus on predicting the individual correctness of different parts of a protein model  <cit> , but this is gradually changing with the introduction of a separate category for local quality assessment in casp. in fact, we believe that local quality prediction might even be more useful than global prediction. first, it is relatively easy to produce a global score from the local, making global scoring a special case of the local one. second, a local score can be used as a guide for further local improvement and refinement of a model. third, even without refinement local quality estimates are useful for biologist as it provides confidence measures for different parts of protein models.

in this study, we present the development of the next generation of the proq quality prediction algorithm, and how we have been able to improve local quality prediction quite significantly through better use of evolutionary information and combination of locally and globally predicted structural features. proq was one of the first methods that utilized protein models, in contrast to native structures, to derive and combine different types of features that better recognize correct models  <cit> . this was later extended to local prediction in proqres  <cit>  and to membrane proteins  <cit> . we have reworked the method from scratch by using a support vector machine  for prediction, and it has been trained on a large set of structural models from casp <dig>  in addition to evolutionary data, there are several new model features used to improve performance significantly, e.g. predicted surface area and a much-improved description of predicted secondary structure. we also show that including features averaged over the entire model, e.g. overall agreement with secondary structure and predicted surfaces, improves local prediction performance too.

RESULTS
the aim of this study was to develop an improved version of proq that predict local as well as global structural model correctness. the main idea is to calculate scalar features from each protein model based on properties that can be derived from its sequence  or 3d coordinates  and use these features to predict model correctness . to achieve a localized prediction, the environment around each residue is described by calculating the features for a sliding window centered around the residue of interest. for features involving spatial contacts, residues or atoms outside the window that are in spatial proximity of those in the window are included as well. after the local prediction is performed, global prediction is achieved by summing the local predictions and normalize by the target sequence length to enable comparisons between proteins. thus, the global score is a number in the range  <cit> . the local prediction is the local s-score, as defined in the methods section.

development of proq2
from the earlier studies, we expect optimal performance by combining different types of input features  <cit> . to get an idea of which features contribute most to the performance, support vector machines  were trained using five-fold cross–validation on individual input features as well as in combination of different feature types. after trying different svm kernels , we chose the linear kernel function for its performance, speed and simplicity.

the pearson’s correlation coefficient for svms trained with different input features is shown in table  <dig>  first, we retrained proq on casp <dig>  the original version of proq used neural networks and as expected the performance did not change much merely with the change of machine learning algorithm. the difference is well within what would be expected by chance. this retrained version of proq was used as the baseline predictor against which new single features were tested. in this way, any improvement over proq will easily be identified as significant improvements over the baseline.

overall pearson’s correlation coefficient, for different input features, benchmarked using cross-validation on the casp <dig> data set. .

the largest performance increase in local prediction accuracy is actually obtained by including global features describing the agreement with predicted and actual secondary structure, and predicted and actual residue surface area calculated as an average over the whole model. even though these features are not providing any localized information, they increase the correlation between local predicted and true quality significantly over the baseline . the performance increase is about the same for predicted secondary structure and predicted surface area. the use of global features, i.e. features calculated over the whole model to predict local quality, is not as strange as it first might seem. the global features reveal whether the model is overall accurate, an obvious prerequisite for the local quality to be accurate. for instance, from the local perspective a model might appear correct, i.e. favorable interactions and good local agreement with secondary structure prediction, but a worse global agreement could affect the the accuracy in the first region too. both predicted secondary structure and predicted surface area are also among the local features that result in a slight performance increase .

the second-largest performance increase is obtained by profile weighting . this is actually not a new feature, but rather a re-weighting of the residue-residue contact and surface area features used in the original version of proq, which is here based on multiple sequence alignment of homologous sequences. this re-weighting improves the performance of residue-residue contacts and surface area based predictors to equal degree .

finally, a small increase is also observed by adding the information per position from the pssm, a measure of local sequence conservation. this is despite the fact that this type of information in principle should have been captured by the feature describing correspondence between calculated surface exposure and the one predicted from sequence conservation.

combining proq <dig> with pcons
it has been shown many times, both in casp  <cit>  and elsewhere  <cit> , that consensus methods are superior mqaps compared to stand-alone or single methods not using consensus or template information, at least in terms of correlation. however, a major drawback with consensus methods is that they perform optimally in the fold recognition regime, but tend to do worse in free modeling where consensus is lacking or for easy comparative modeling targets, where consensus is all there is. even though the correlation can be quite high, they often fail in selecting the best possible model.

here, we combine the structural evaluation made by proq <dig> with consensus information from pcons to overcome some of the problems with model selection for consensus based methods. the proq <dig> and pcons scores are combined using a linear sum with one free parameter: 

 sproq2+pcons=sproq2+k·spconsk∈ <cit> , 

 where k was optimized to k= <dig>  to maximize gdt <dig> . other ways to combine the two scores were tried but this linear combination showed the best performance. since both the proq <dig> and the pcons score reflect model correctness, a linear combination makes sense. in the case of free-modeling targets the consensus score will be low and most of the selection will be made on the proq <dig> score. analogously, in the case of easy comparative modeling targets the consensus score will be high but it will be high for most of the models, and the selection will again essentially be done by the proq <dig> score.

overall for casp <dig> targets, the combination selects models that are of  <dig> % and  <dig> % higher quality compared to proq <dig> and pcons respectively, while maintaining a good correlation. the bootstrap support values calculated according to  <cit> , with repeated random selection with return, are higher than  <dig> , which demonstrates that gdt <dig> for the combination is higher in more than 95% of the cases.

benchmark of local model correctness
for the benchmarking of model correctness, both at the local and global level, a set of models from casp <dig> and casp <dig> was used. since proq <dig> was trained on casp <dig>  this set is completely independent. to be able to compare the performance, predictions from top-performing mqaps were also included in the benchmark . unfortunately, not all of these methods had predictions for all models and all residues, so we filtered the number of models to a set for which there were predictions from all methods. even though this excluded many models, there were still more than  <dig>  million residues from over  <dig>  models remaining.

description of the single-model methods and the reference consensus method included in the benchmark. the single methods  do not use any template or consensus information. consensus and hybrid methods  are free to use any type of information. ∗this method was originally called proqres, but for clarity it will be referred to as proq both for global and local quality prediction.  single-model method  consensus method.

we focused the benchmark on different properties that cover various aspects of local model correctness. the most obvious is the correspondence between predicted and true local quality score, which was measured by correlation at different levels . the performance of the single-model methods is similar on both casp <dig> and casp <dig> data sets. among all the methods, proq <dig> correlates best with the correct local s-score, achieving correlations of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for casp <dig> and casp <dig>  respectively. the improvement over the second-best mqap in casp <dig>  is significant with p-value <10− <dig> using the fisher r to z transform .

to get an idea of how good the top-ranking residues from the different methods are, we also calculated the average distance deviations from the true value for different fraction of top-ranking residues . this measure should ideally be as low as possible, but will gradually increase to the average deviation over the whole set. on casp <dig> , proq <dig> has a much lower average distance than proq and lower compared to qmean for the same level of top ranking residues. this is also maintained on the casp <dig> data set, even though the distance to qmean is smaller and the new single-model method metamqap performs between proq <dig> and qmean.

finally, the ability to recognize correct and incorrect residues was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic  plots with cutoffs of <3Å and >5Å deviations for correct and incorrect residues, respectively . for clarity, we have excluded our local consensus servers, pcons and the proq2+pcons combination, in all figures and only include the top-ranked consensus method from casp <dig>  qmeanclust, as comparison. all consensus methods perform similarly at least in comparison to single-model methods . the relative ranking of the methods based on the ability to recognize correct and incorrect residues  is the same as using the average distance deviation . however, proq <dig> seem to be relatively better at finding incorrect residues.

in all of the above tests the performance of the reference consensus method, qmeanclust, is of course better than any of the single-model methods, but the performance gap is now significantly smaller.

benchmark of global model correctness
in the benchmark of global model correctness, the ability to predict global quality as well as the ability to select models was assessed. the first ability is important for assessing how reliable the predicted quality estimates are. this is not necessarily the same as the model selection ability, which only is about selecting the best possible model. the result from the global benchmark is shown in table  <dig>  the quality predicted by proq <dig> has a correlation coefficient of  <dig>  on both casp <dig> and casp <dig> data sets. this is significantly better  than the correlation for single-model method with second highest correlation, qmean  . in fact all correlation differences except qmean and metamqap on casp <dig> are statistical significant at the  <dig>  significance level.

benchmark of global model quality on casp <dig> and casp <dig> data sets. r is overall correlation, rtarget the average correlation per target, ∑gdt <dig> is the the sum of the first-ranked models for each target and ∑zgdt <dig> is the summed z-score for the first-ranked models for each target. the first value corresponds to results on casp <dig>  the second to casp <dig>  and cells with only one value are casp <dig> only.

pairwise statistical significance test on the correlation coefficients for global quality prediction from casp <dig>  and casp <dig> . the values correspond to the logarithm of the p-value for methods being statistically indistinguishable, obtained by comparing the distribution of fisher’s z  for the correlation coefficients, r, from table  <dig>  values in italics are not distinguishable at the 10−3significance level.

the model selection as measured by the sum of gdt_ts for the first ranked model is also significantly improved, from  <dig> / <dig>  for the best single-model methods in casp <dig>  and casp <dig>  to  <dig> / <dig>  for proq <dig> on the two data sets. to put the numbers in perspective, the performance is now closer to the selection of the reference consensus method qmeanclust  than to the selection of the previous best performing single-model methods. in addition, when proq <dig> is combined with our consensus method pcons, the model selection is improved further to  <dig> / <dig> . this performance is similar to the best performing consensus methods and clearly better than pcons alone , which demonstrates the added value of proq <dig> 

although it is commonly used as a measure of model selection, the sum of gdt_ts for the first ranked model gives higher emphasis to easier targets, since these will have higher gdt_ts. to analyze the target selection in more detail, we calculated z-scores by subtracting the mean quality from the quality of the selected model and dividing by the standard deviation for each target. these z-scores are not biased by target difficulty, since the scores are normalized by the quality distribution for each target. thereby it also directly measures the added value of the model quality assessment program over a random pick, which would have a z-score of zero. the distributions of z-scores for the different methods are shown in figure  <dig> 

proq <dig> has lower number of predictions below average  and larger number of predictions with z-score greater than  <dig> compared to the other single-model methods. only for a few targets  does the model selected by proq <dig> have a z<- <dig> , while both qmean and proq have more than  <dig> models with z-scores in that range. this is in sharp contrast to the consensus methods that never select models with z<- <dig>  and on casp <dig> none of the consensus methods select models with z< <dig>  demonstrating that consensus methods seldom select models worse than average. this is one of the clear advantages over non-consensus methods. however, at the other end of the spectrum, the ability of the consensus method to select models with high z-score is quite far from optimal, as demonstrated by the z-score distribution for pcons and qmeanclust on the casp <dig> data set in figure 4a. in fact, all single-models methods select more models with z> <dig> than either pcons or qmeanclust, indicating that combining the results from single methods with consensus could potentially improve the results at the high end. this is also exactly what is observed for proq2+pcons, were the number of models with z> <dig> increases significantly from  <dig> for pcons to  <dig> for proq2+pcons on the combined casp8/casp <dig> set .

CONCLUSIONS
the aim of this study was to improve both local and global single-model quality assessment. this was done by training support vector machines to predict the local quality measure, s-score, with a combination of evolutionary and multiple sequence alignment information combined with other structural features on data from casp <dig>  the final version, proq <dig>  was compared to the top-performing single-model quality assessment groups in casp <dig> as well as to its predecessor, proq, on the complete casp <dig> data set.

we show that proq <dig> is superior to proq in all aspects. the correlation between predicted and true quality is improved from  <dig> / <dig>   to  <dig> / <dig>  on the local level and from  <dig> / <dig>  to  <dig> / <dig>  on the global level. in addition, the selection of high-quality models is also dramatically improved. proq <dig> is significantly better than the top-performing single-model quality assessment groups in both casp <dig> and casp <dig>  the improvement in correlation is larger on the local level, but still significant on the global level. the largest improvement is however in the selection of high-quality models with a sum of z-score improvement from  <dig> / <dig>  on casp8/casp <dig> for the second-ranked single model to  <dig> / <dig>  for proq <dig>  finally, we also show that proq <dig> combined with the consensus predictor pcons can improve the selection even further.
