BACKGROUND
small endogenous non-coding rna  transcripts including small interfering rna , microrna  and piwi-interacting rna  are critical regulators in rna-mediated silencing in plants and metazoa <cit> . these small rnas, which are approximately  <dig> nucleotides long, guide the rna-induced silencing complex  to their target sites and exert regulatory functions including chromatin modelling, post-transcriptional repression and mrna destabilization, which is usually through pairing within the 3'untranslated region of target mrnas <cit> .

the biogenesis and regulation of sncrnas vary among different organisms. sirnas are frequently found derived from transposable elements , repeated sequences and antisense strands of protein-coding mrna templates <cit> , while mirnas are encoded by genes either clustered or dispersed in the genome. they can be intergenic or intragenic. mirna genes within introns or downstream of the rrna genes are co-transcribed with the host genes, while the genes independently located are likely controlled by a separated mechanism. further, the sequences of endogenous sirna transcripts seem to be more diverse, whereas conservation patterns do exist in certain mirnas <cit> . for example, homologues of the temporal mirnas, lin- <dig> and let- <dig> originally identified in caenorhabditis elegans, have been found in a variety of eukaryotes, though they might not exert similar functions in different host cells <cit> .

while the knowledge regarding sncrna biology is rapidly expanding, there is little known in schistosomes. these are parasites of at least seven developmental stages that can cause human or zoonotic schistosomiasis, which affect more than  <dig> million people worldwide <cit> . schistosomes are the lowest group of bilateria that diverged early from the metazoan lineage, and they are among the first animals to develop sexual dimorphism  and heteromorphic sex chromosomes <cit> . they have seven pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes, consisting of approximately  <dig> mb of genome sequence per schistosomal parasite <cit> . the unique developmental features and the availability of the genome sequences for both s. mansoni and s. japonicum has made it possible to conduct genome-wide transcriptomal and functional characterization of sncrnas in these parasites.

RESULTS
discovery of sncrnas in s. japonicum
we identified and characterized micrornas and endogenous sirnas in s. japonicum both in the schistosomula  and in the adult worms by direct sequencing using solexa sequencing technology, as this technique achieves a more complete coverage of small rna transcripts than a traditional cdna cloning approach <cit> . sequencing of small rnas yielded  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> unfiltered sequence reads from adult worms and schistosomula, respectively. after removal of reads containing ambiguous base calls, there were  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  clean reads, which contained  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> unique clean reads, respectively. these unique clean reads were mapped to the genome of s. japonicum by forcing perfect alignments beginning at the first nucleotide and retaining the longest region of overlap for each read. after elimination of sequences of trna, rrna and mitochondrial dna-derived rnas , potential mirnas and sirnas were further analyzed <cit> .

of the small sncrnas transcripts identified in s. japonicum, a large portion was from potential transposable elements  . due to the fact that these sncrnas showed similar structural signatures to sirna transcripts reported in drosophila <cit> , the small rna transcript sequences mapped to the transposable elements  and the natural antisense transcripts  were regarded as endogenous sirnas <cit> . since tes have not been previously identified in s. japonicum, we conducted te prediction by scanning the genome sequence using repet software. long terminal repeats , long interspersed nucleotide elements , short interspersed elements , large terminal inverted repeats  and miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements  were the main classes of transposons identified in the genome. we found that te-related sequences accounted for  <dig> percent of the s. japonicum genome , which is lower than that observed in mammalian dna that can range between  <dig> and 50%  <cit> . further, sirnas derived from ltr, tir and line accounted for the majority and transcripts from sense and antisense strands were identified . sequence scanning of the two transposons saci- <dig>   <cit>  and rte- <dig>  revealed that sirnas were derived from more concentrated regions in the sequence , contrast to that found in drosophila, in which sirnas were generated uniformly from the whole transposon sequence <cit> .

furthermore, sirnas accounted for a major portion of the sncrnas identified, while mirnas contributed less. in adult parasites, there were  <dig>  te-derived sirnas including  <dig>  unique clean reads, and there were  <dig>  mirnas including  <dig>  unique clean reads . in schistosomulum, there were  <dig> , <dig> te-derived sirnas including  <dig>  unique clean reads, and there were  <dig>  mirnas reads including  <dig>  unique clean reads . thus, more te-derived sirnas in schistosomulum were obtained than in the adult, while the number of mirnas obtained from the two stages was just opposite, i.e., more mirnas were identified in adult worms than in schistosomulum. on the other hand, mirnas were more abundant, and sirnas only accounted for a small portion in drosophila somatic cells <cit> . the data indicated that s. japomicum, compared to drosophila, may possess a different regulation mechanism in sncrna transcription.

until recently,the endogenous sirnas identified in drosophila and mouse <cit>  were found to be mainly derived from transposable elements, complementary annealed transcripts and long 'fold-back' transcripts . natural antisense transcripts  generated from bidirectional gene transcription are the second source of endogenous sirnas  <cit> . sirnas of approximately  <dig> nt derived from double-stranded rna are associate with ago <dig> in drosophila <cit> . in contrast, pirnas of 24- <dig> nt, which are only functional in the germline, appear to be dicer-independent and are associated with piwi proteins <cit> . we found ago <dig> homologues in s. japonicum using a blast search, but we did not identify a piwi homologue . nat-derived sirnas were identified from overlapped regions of mrnas of  <dig> predicted genes, and almost all of them were trans-nat sirnas. there were  <dig>  nat-derived sirnas including  <dig>  unique clean reads in adult worms and  <dig>  nat-derived sirnas including  <dig>  unique clean reads in schistosomulum , indicating that the biogenesis of nat-derived sirnas in the parasite might be associated with the activation of stage-specific genes. further analysis found that the overlapped regions of mrna transcripts where most of the sirnas were generated from were almost exclusively < <dig> bp  and the number of sirnas identified from sense and antisense stands were almost equal , which indicated that they were not degraded mrna templates. collectively, these data revealed that the two main pathways of sirna biogenesis in s. japonicum are processing of te-derived transcripts and endogenous double strand rnas  and the te-derived sirnas accounted for the main portion of the sirna pool, at least in the two development stages of the parasite.

length and end variations of sncrnas in s. japonicum
the variations in the length of sncrnas in s. japonicum were associated with the developmental stages of the parasite. in adult worms, there was an even distribution of the amount of sncrnas that were between  <dig> and  <dig> nt . the te-derived sirnas were predominantly  <dig> nt in adult worms, whereas they exhibited a wider range in length in schistosomulum between  <dig> and  <dig> nt . the nat-derived sirnas were predominantly  <dig> nt in parasites of both schistosomulum and adult stages. thus te-derived sirnas and nat-derived sirnas were generated under different regulatory and processing mechanisms. the size of the mirnas also differed between the two developmental stages. in adult worms, mirnas ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nt were found, although the mirnas of  <dig> and  <dig> nt accounted for the majority . however, mirnas of  <dig> nt were predominant in schistosomulum  indicating that several mirna processing pathways might be functional in different developmental stages of the parasite.

in adult worm, all te-derived sirnas had the tendency of ending with a uracil residue, while in schistosomulum, only the  <dig> nt sirnas were with this composition . of the nat-derived sirnas, the  <dig> nt sirnas ended with either an adenosine or a uracil in schistosomulum but not in the adult worm, while the  <dig> nt sirnas from both stages had a similar sequence at the 3' ends . the sequences of both mirna and sirna completely match to the genome sequence suggesting that there is no sequence modification in the generation of small rnas, which is similar to that found in drosophila  <cit> .

characterization of mirnas derived from four developmental stages of s. japonicum including cercariae, hepatic schistosomulum, adult worm and egg was performed. the mirnas were between  <dig> and  <dig> nt in the adult and predominantly  <dig> nt in schistosomulum . interestingly, mirnas of all sizes predominantly ended with a uracil, and there were no observed stage-related variations . this was different from mirnas derived from other metazoan species, which always begin with a uracil <cit> . it remains further investigation whether this is due to the processing of species-specific pre-mirna or due to functional restriction of the risc.

mirnas are generated from hairpin structures formed by the complementary sequences within one transcript. after processing by the enzyme dicer, two complementary sequences  will be released. in this study, there was a diverse variety of mirna isomers observed. in general, if a dominant sequence was observed, the complementary sequence was also more frequently observed but with significantly different frequency. for example, sja-mir-36a was one of the dominant mirnas observed , and its complementary strand sequence  was also commonly observed , but it was significantly less stable than its counterpart. furthermore, the number of reads for multiple mature mirna strands derived from the same precursor differed dramatically, which indicated that the hydrolysis process mediated by dicer and its associated proteins might not be very precise and the mirna stability might be determined by the terminal nucleotide residues.

earlier study has found that expression of mirna genes can be both monocistronic and polycistronic <cit> ; however, little is known regarding the genetic regulation of mirna expression. certain mirna-encoding genes are located within the introns of host genes; therefore, they might be transcriptionally regulated through their host-gene promoters <cit> . in this study, we found that mirna genes were predominantly intergenic in s. japonicum, thus most mirna genes have their own control elements  in the genome  <cit> . surprisingly, we found that genes within the same cluster exhibited an asymmetrical transcription pattern. for instance, sja-mir-2a, 2b and sja-novel- <dig> were situated within one cluster ; however, the number of reads of sja-mir-2a and sja-novel- <dig> could be  <dig> times less than that of sja-mir-2b. even though it cannot be ruled out that the differences in reads among the mirnas encoded in the same cluster were due to experimental factors, it is also possible that several layers of regulation may control mirna transcription within the same gene cluster.

identification and characterization of developmental stage-associated mirnas in s. japonicum
for further categorization of the mirnas, alignments were performed with mirna sequences derived from s. japonicum and mirnas from other organisms using the clustalw  <dig>  program <cit> . similar to the study on the planarian schmidtea mediterranea  <cit> , many mirnas discovered in the parasite were common to other metazoan lineages as well as mirnas that were unique to s. japonicum. there were  <dig> mirnas classified as common mirnas with evolutionarily conserved characteristics related to  <dig> metazoan mirna families including let- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> . of the commen mirnas,  <dig> showed high similirity to that reported in s. mediterranea  <cit> . mirnas unique to s. japonicum  were also identified .

real-time pcr was used to relatively quantify the dominantly expressed mirnas, and the results were confirmed by northern blotting . in general, more mirnas were expressed at stages other than the egg, except sja-mir-2b and sja-mir- <dig>  which were constantly expressed during all stages with less than 10-fold variations . the expression of sja-mir- <dig> and  <dig> was predominant in the cercarial stage. mir- <dig> has been reported to regulate segmentation and sensory organ development in drosophila, and mir- <dig> has been associated with the transition from the embryo to l <dig> stage in c. elegans <cit> . thus it is reasonable to observe significantly increased expression of the homologous mirnas  in the cercariae stage of s. japonicum, since this is the stage the parasite quickly transforms into schistosomulum after invasion into a mammalian host. the mirna let- <dig>  which was originally identified to be dominantly expressed during the l3/l <dig> transition stage in c. elegans <cit> , played a critical role in stage-specific differentiation . its homologous mirna sja-let- <dig> was also identified in s. japonicum. in contrast to its counterpart in c. elegans, sja-let- <dig> was expressed in all developmental stages with a similar magnitude except during the egg stage, indicating that this mirna has evolved to other functions than developmental timing in the schistosomal parasite . mir- <dig> was previously found to be expressed in the drosophila embryo, and it was implicated in controlling cell differentiation <cit> . however, the homolog to mir- <dig>  sja-mir- <dig>  was predominantly expressed in male parasites. there were also mirnas identified that were predominantly expressed in female parasites, such as sja-novel-70; its expression was approximately  <dig> times higher in females, as compared to cercariae, male worms and eggs. the amount of sja-novel- <dig> transcripts expressed during the female stage was one hundred thousand times higher than that in the schistosomulum stage . even though the expression of sja-novel- <dig> was more predominant in female worms, its expression was also detected in males. the discovery of these sex-related mirnas indicated that mirnas might regulate parasite sexual differentiation or reproduction machinery. since schistosomal parasites are among the first animals to develop sexual dimorphism <cit> , further study on this aspect may result in increased understanding of the molecular control of female and male development. five mirnas in s. japonicum have been previously identified via a conventional cdna cloning and sequencing approach <cit> . compared to the previous report, apart from the reported mirna transcripts, more mirnas common to other organisms as well as novel mirna transcripts were identified in this study due to the powerful coverage of the large scale sequencing capacity of solexa technology. further, we identified and characterized endogenous sirnas which were dominantly derived from transposable elements in the genome of the parasite.

CONCLUSIONS
schistosomiasis is one of the most important human helminth infections <cit>  that affects more than  <dig> million people worldwide. currently, praziquantel is the only drug available for treating schistosomiasis. investigations focused on parasite biology and identification of novel drug targets have become of great importance. here we have identified a panel of common as well unique mirnas and sirnas in s. japonicum. the identification and characterization of sirnas and mirnas in the parasite and their possible biological functions have opened a new avenue towards a final dissection of parasite biology and will hopefully facilitate the discovery of potential anti-parasitic drug targets.
