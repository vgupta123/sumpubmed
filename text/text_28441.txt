BACKGROUND
vasculogenesis, the development of the primary vasculature during embryogenesis, requires a highly orchestrated series of events that are spatially and temporally regulated  <cit> . intra-embryonic vasculogenesis is preceded by extra-embryonic vascular development within the yolk sac  <cit> . pioneering studies conducted in avian embryos and subsequently extended in amphibian and mammalian model systems in multiple different species have demonstrated the close association between the development of the hematopoietic and endothelial lineages  <cit> .

the hemangioblast is a bipotent cell of mesodermal origin that can give rise to hematopoietic and ecs. the possible existence of a common precursor was originally suggested because of the close spatial association of hematopoietic cells and ecs in the blood islands associated with the developing embryos, and also because hematopoietic and ecs co-express a number of genes. one of the earliest markers expressed on cells of endothelial and hematopoietic origin is the vegf receptor flk- <dig> or vegf-r <dig>  further support for the existence of the hemangioblast comes from the differentiation of embryonic stem cells along the endothelial and hematopoietic lineages  <cit> . when individual cells are allowed to differentiate further, they form adherent cells that express more endothelial specific markers whereas many of the non-adherent cells, presumed to be of hematopoietic origin, express such genes as Î²-hemoglobin  <cit> . differentiation along the hematopoietic lineage is marked by the expression of cell surface markers including cd <dig> and cd <dig>  a similar, time-dependent change in the expression of cell surface markers on cells of the hematopoietic and endothelial lineage occurs during the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into embryoid bodies.

several receptor tyrosine kinases, including the vegf-r <dig>  vegf-r <dig>  tie <dig>  and tie <dig> genes are known to be critical mediators of endothelial differentiation and vascular development. targeted disruption of any of these genes leads to defects in vascular development and early embryonic lethality  <cit> . comparison of the mouse and human dna sequences within the regulatory regions of these genes has facilitated the identification of conserved binding sites for different classes of transcription factors. the tie <dig> gene promoter contains conserved binding sites for ets factors and ap <dig>  <cit> . mutations in most of these conserved binding sites leads to marked reductions in the ability of the tie <dig> promoter to direct lacz gene expression in transgenic animals. a similar approach has been used to identify conserved binding sites for the ets factors, scl/tal- <dig>  and gata factors in the vegf-r <dig> gene. point mutations in some of these binding sites also leads to marked reductions in the vascular specific expression directed by the vegf-r <dig> regulatory regions in transgenic studies  <cit> . conserved ets binding sites exist in the tie <dig> and vegf-r <dig> genes  <cit> . the results of these studies strongly support the hypothesis that members of certain transcription factor families, including the ets and gata transcription factor families are involved in regulating the different stages of vascular development and endothelial differentiation by regulating endothelial-specific gene expression.

the ets genes are a family of at least thirty members that function as transcription factors. all ets factors share a highly conserved 80- <dig> amino acid long dna binding domain, the ets domain  <cit> . many macrophage, b cell and t cell specific genes are regulated by ets factors. more recently several vascular-specific genes have been shown to be downstream targets of selected ets factors. in addition to the tie <dig>  tie <dig>  vegf-r <dig>  and vegf-r <dig> genes mentioned above, several other endothelial specific genes including von willebrand factor , pecam- <dig>  ve-cadherin, endothelial nitric oxide synthase genes have functionally important conserved binding sites for members of the ets transcription factor family  <cit> . the ets factor erg has recently been shown to interact with a number of other transcription factors to regulate several endothelial-specific genes including angiopoietin- <dig>  ve-cadherin, endoglin, and vwf  <cit> . the goal of this study was to determine the role of erg as a transcriptional regulator of es cell differentiation, and in particular, to determine whether it plays a role in regulating ec differentiation or hematopoiesis.

RESULTS
erg expression during endothelial differentiation
we recently completed a gene profiling study comparing the expression of genes in vegf-r <dig> expressing embryonic stem cells as they differentiate along the endothelial versus the hematopoietic lineages. of particular interest to us was the ets factor erg which was restricted to ve-cadherin positive cells <cit> . we analyzed erg expression further during es cells differentiation by quantitative -rt-pcr and observed a very similar temporal pattern for the expression of erg and ve-cadherin . fluorescence activated cell sorting  was used to further define the specific populations of cells expressing erg during es cell differentiation. cells expressing either vegf-r <dig> , the endothelial-specific marker ve-cadherin , or the hematopoietic marker cd <dig>  were sorted and rna was extracted from these cells. q-rt-pcr demonstrated that erg was expressed in vegf-r <dig> positive cells at day  <dig>  and then in ve-cadherin positive cells, but not cd <dig> expressing cells at day  <dig>  . flow cytometry using an antibody directed against erg demonstrated a time-dependent increase in erg expression during differentiation with approximately  <dig> % of cells expressing erg by day  <dig> . erg segregation with specific cell populations  was evaluated at day  <dig>  by flow cytometry using antibodies directed against erg and one of the following: ve-cadherin, cd <dig> and the erythroid marker ter <dig>  erg is predominantly expressed in ve-cadherin positive cells, and not cd <dig> or ter <dig> positive cells . although only a small percentage of cells express ter <dig> at day  <dig> , erg was not expressed in ter <dig> expressing cells at later time points either .

evaluation of temporal and spatial expression of erg during es cell differentiation
erg and ve-cadherin expression were evaluated in frozen eb sections at day 3- <dig> by immunofluorescence to define the temporal and spatial pattern of erg expression in developing ebs. erg and ve-cadherin are first expressed at day  <dig> to  <dig>  and there is a very close association between cells expressing erg  and those expressing ve-cadherin  throughout eb differentiation . whereas erg appears to be predominantly restricted to the nucleus of cells, ve-cadherin is observed on the cell surface. furthermore, ve-cadherin expressing cells coalesce into structures resembling primitive blood vessels and line the inner surface of the cystic structures . further demonstration of the close association between the ve-cadherin expressing cells and erg was observed by confocal microscopy also demonstrating the nuclear localization of erg . a similar close association between erg and another ec-restricted protein endoglin  was also observed during es cell differentiation , but that was distinct from the hematopoietic marker cd <dig> 

erg expression during vascular development
to begin to define erg expression during vascular development, mouse embryos at different stages of development were isolated. erg expression was evaluated by immuno-fluorescence. as early as e <dig>  erg and vegf-r <dig> appear to be expressed in the blood islands enriched in hemangioblasts that are the common early precursors for the endothelial and hematopoietic lineages. serial sections of yolk sac demonstrate expression of erg and vegf-r <dig> in the same region . later during development, we observed a close correlation between erg and ve-cadherin expression in developing vascular structures and blood vessels in a number of tissues. for example, erg expression is observed in ecs of the dorsal aorta at embryonic day  <dig>  , and at day  <dig>  . although there is faint erg staining in a few cells within the lumen of the aorta, the vast majority of erg staining is located within the vessel wall in close approximation with ve-cadherin. just as in the ebs, erg expression is localized within the nucleus of ve-cadherin expressing cells. erg expression is also observed in the trabeculated endocardial surface of the common atrium and ventricle of the heart at embryonic stage e <dig>  . ec-specific expression was also observed in several other tissues including the intersomitic, and mesonephric blood vessels of the aorta-gonado-mesonephros  region, and blood vessels of the umbilical cord .

lentiviral knockdown of erg in es cells
to further define the role of erg as a transcriptional regulator of endothelial-specific gene expression and endothelial differentiation, we tested the ability of four different lentiviral vectors encoding shrna directed against mouse erg to suppress erg expression during es cell differentiation. sequence analysis of the shrna sequences confirmed the specificity for erg . undifferentiated murine cce es cells were infected with control  and the four lentiviral vectors directed against erg . puromycin was used to stably select individual clones. erg expression was measured in the clones  <dig> days after their differentiation into ebs. a 75-80% reduction in erg expression was observed in three out of the four erg shrna , as measured by q-rt-pcr and western blot analysis when compared to control shrna . to evaluate whether changes in erg expression are associated with alterations in the number of ecs and/or vascular structure formation, we examined the expression of erg and ve-cadherin in the erg shrna clones. whereas the control shrna clones exhibited a similar pattern of vascular structure formation to untransfected es cells during eb formation, there was a marked reduction in the number of ve-cadherin expressing cells and the formation of vascular structures in the erg shrna clones . because we first observed erg expression in a subset of vegf-r <dig> expressing cells, we also wanted to determine whether erg affects the number of vegf-r <dig> expressing cells or hemangioblast development. vegf-r <dig> expression was evaluated in two of the erg knockdown clones compared to the control clones. there was no change in the number of vegf-r <dig> expressing cells at day  <dig> , suggesting that erg does not regulate hemangioblast development, but rather the very early stages of ec differentiation. at later time points , the number of vegf-r <dig> positive cells decreases in erg shrna ebs as compared to controls which is most likely due to the decreased number of ec progenitors or ecs expressing vegf-r <dig> .

flow cytometric evaluation of erg and control shrna treated es cells
to evaluate the effect of erg suppression on endothelial and hematopoietic lineages, flow cytometric analysis using markers specific for both lineages was performed on day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of differentiation. a reduction in several genes expressed on endothelial cells was observed in the ergshrna clones compared to the controls, with the most striking reductions in the direct targets of erg ve-cadherin and endoglin, particularly at day  <dig>   <cit> . it is known that some of these genes, such as endoglin are expressed on the hemangioblast cells as well as endothelial cells  <cit> . in a separate experiment using shrna knockdown of erg in huvecs cells, we identified that tie <dig> and vegf-r <dig>  are not direct targets of erg . however, a significant reduction of tie <dig> and vegf-r <dig> was seen in our ergshrna clones by facs analysis, indicating that suppression of erg affects not only the expression of erg target genes but also the number of ecs. in contrast, no change in the expression of cd <dig> and cd <dig> occurred suggesting that there was no significant effect on hematopoietic lineage differentiation . furthermore, we observed a decrease of about 30% in the potential of the ergshrna clones to form vascular sprouts when compared to the controls . this may be related to a decrease in the number of ecs and/or impaired function of the ecs due the reduction in the expression of several endothelial-restricted genes. we also evaluated the ability of control and ergshrna es cells to form hematopoietic cells using a blast colony-forming cell assay. no difference was observed in the hematopoietic potential of control versus ergshrna es cells .

identification of erg downstream targets during es cell differentiation

previous studies have shown that targeted disruption or knockdown of ve-cadherin alone is not sufficient to inhibit ec differentiation  <cit> . to further define the molecular mechanisms by which erg regulates ec differentiation, we sorted vegf-r <dig> expressing cells after  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days of differentiation using mouse es cells with stable suppression of erg and from control cells. erg expression was nearly undetectable at day  <dig> . early expression was detected at day  <dig> and significant reductions of erg expression were observed in the erg shrna cells at both day  <dig> and day  <dig>  comparison of erg shrna and control shrna cells at day  <dig> and day  <dig> revealed several genes that were differentially expressed . most of the genes were repressed upon erg suppression. the heat map of a selected number of differentially downregulated genes at day  <dig> and  <dig> are shown . we observed reductions in the expression of a number of transcription factors as well as ec-restricted genes. quantitative rt-pcr was used to evaluate changes in the expression of selected ets transcription factors in differentiated es cells derived from control and erg shrna treated clones. whereas a significant reduction in the expression of erg was observed, no change in the expression of other ets factors was observed . we similarly examined the expression of a number of mesodermal and hematopoietic markers and did not observe significant changes in the expression of these markers, with the exception of the scl gene where we observed a slight reduction . in contrast, reductions in several ec-restricted proteins and transcription factors known to regulate ec-restricted gene expression were observed . further validation of some of the putative erg targets was evaluated by chromatin immunoprecipitation . in addition to ve-cadherin, we confirmed binding of erg to putative erg binding sites within the proximal promoters of the hey <dig> and endoglin genes.

discussion
the results of several recent studies point towards an emerging role for erg as a transcriptional regulator of ec-restricted genes  <cit> . the findings of our study support a unique role for the ets factor erg as a transcriptional regulator of endothelial differentiation. erg expression was first detected in a sub-population of vegf-r2+ expressing cells that co-express ve-cadherin, and closely correlates with the expression of ve-cadherin during es cell differentiation. inhibition of erg expression, however, did not alter the number of vegf-r <dig> expressing cells just prior to their differentiation along the endothelial and hematopoietic lineages suggesting that erg is not required for the formation of the hemangioblast or hematopoiesis. a recent genome-wide analysis of ets factors in zebrafish identified three members of the ets transcription factor family, including erg, fli- <dig>  and etsrp, as playing a role in hemangioblast differentiation and angiogenesis  <cit> . of these ets family members, etsrp was expressed earliest and required for hemangioblast formation. similarly, mice that have a mutation in the er <dig>  the homologue of etsrp exhibit defects in hematopoiesis and endothelial differentiation  <cit> . in contrast, neither knockdown of erg or fli- <dig> in zebrafish led to abnormalities in hemangioblast formation, which is consistent with our findings in murine es cells.

we observed a very close correlation of erg and ve-cadherin expression in the eb throughout es cell differentiation. erg expression also closely correlates with ve-cadherin expression during embryonic vascular development. erg has previously been shown to regulate the ve-cadherin gene in ecs  <cit> . targeted disruption of ve-cadherin prevented the formation of vessel-like structures in embryoid bodies  <cit> . during mouse development, deficiency of ve-cadherin did not affect the initial assembly of a vascular plexus but was associated with impaired vascular remodeling and maturation  <cit> . knockdown of erg expression not only affected vascular structure formation in embryoid body, but was also associated with a marked reduction in the number of ec. this suggests that erg must regulate additional genes involved in the formation of ec. similar knockdown studies were conducted in zebrafish using morpholino oligonucleotides . mos directed against erg resulted in hemorrhagic defects in the brain between days  <dig>  and  <dig>  without any obvious morphological defects  <cit> . similar defects were observed with mos directed against fli- <dig>  double knockdown of erg and fli- <dig> led to more severe developmental defects with disorganization of the intersomatic vessels. in contrast to our study, knockdown of erg in zebrafish was not associated with a significant reduction in the number of ecs that would be expected to be associated with more pronounced defects in vascular development. one possible explanation for the differences observed is that the mos may have reduced, but not abolished the levels of erg to a point where sufficient levels of the erg protein were present to promote ec differentiation but not later stages of vascular development. alternatively, changes in the function of selected ets family members may have occurred over the course of evolution, with erg playing a more dominant role in murine vascular development than in zebrafish.

one of the earliest known markers of hematopoiesis is cd <dig>   <cit> . while cd <dig> expressing es cells are capable of contributing to multiple hematopoietic lineages, they cannot differentiate into ecs. we did not observe significant expression of erg in vegf-r2+ cells expressing cd <dig>  furthermore, erg knockdown was not associated with reductions in hematopoietic progenitor cells. this is in contrast to recent reports supporting a role for erg in hematopoiesis  <cit> . a missense mutation associated with the alteration of one amino acid in the erg dna binding domain  was associated with marked defects in hematopoiesis due to reductions in transactivation but no change in dna binding affinity. the results of this study contrast with our knockdown studies, and might be explained by the fact that a mutation in erg could result in the formation of a dominant-negative protein with altered affinity for different target genes or changes in the affinity of erg for different interacting proteins.

one of the major downstream targets of erg is ve-cadherin. within the developing embryo there are also temporal changes in the expression of ve-cadherin in hematopoietic stem cells   <cit> . whereas ve-cadherin is expressed in hscs within the agm of embryos at day  <dig> , and in the yolk sac at day  <dig> , there is marked down regulation of ve-cadherin expression during fetal liver colonization and complete loss in hscs with the adult bone marrow formation, suggesting that although a subset of hscs may be derived from a common bipotent precursor population, expression of endothelial markers is not required for maintenance of long-term hsc progenitor cells at later stages of embryonic development or in the adult. previous studies have demonstrated that vegf-r2+/cd144+ isolated from mouse embryos  <dig>  to  <dig>  days post coitum  or from human es cells that are cd <dig> negative but are capable of differentiating along the endothelial and hematopoietic lineages  <cit> . although ve-cadherin expressing cells are capable of differentiating into hematopoietic cells, ve-cadherin negative cells exhibited a 15- <dig> fold greater potential of promoting definitive hematopoiesis than did those expressing ve-cadherin  <cit> . targeted disruption of the ve-cadherin gene did not significantly impair hematopoiesis, with similar numbers of erythroid, myeloid, and mixed hematopoietic progenitor cells in e <dig>  embryos compared to wild type controls  <cit> . this would support the overall concept of a "hemogenic" endothelium, but with a predominant mechanism of hematopoietic differentiation being independent of ec differentiation.

erg is among a very few number of transcription factors that exhibit an ec-restricted expression pattern. for example, vezf <dig> is a zinc finger transcription factor that contributes to vascular remodeling and the development of both the vascular and lymphatic endothelium  <cit> . the homeobox transcription factor hex is expressed at the hemangioblast stage and contributes to the hematopoietic and endothelial lineages  <cit> . another family of transcription factors belonging to the foxo subset of forkhead transcription factors are expressed in ecs and function as transcriptional regulators of angiogenic growth factors and vascular stabilization  <cit> . selected transcription factors have also been identified that regulate later stages of endothelial differentiation, into arterial , venous , and lymphatic endothelium   <cit> . erg shrna was associated with significant decreases in the expression of vezf <dig>  hey <dig>  and hey <dig>  with confirmation of at least one of these transcription factors, hey <dig>  as being a direct target of erg as demonstrated by chip. in contrast, transcription factors known to be critical regulators of hematopoiesis, including runx <dig> and hoxb <dig>  were not significantly altered by knockdown of erg. in summary, the results of our study provide strong evidence for a critical role for erg as a transcriptional regulator of early ec differentiation that does not affect hematopoiesis or hemangioblast development.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of our study demonstrate that erg regulates the expression of a number of ec-restricted genes during es cell differentiation. knockdown of erg is associated with a significant reduction in the formation of vascular structures in developing embryoid bodies and the number of endothelial cells, that may have important implications for the role of erg in vascular development during mouse embryogenesis. erg does not appear to be required for the development of hematopoietic precursor cells during es cell differentiation. erg may therefore play a unique role as a transcriptional regulator of ec differentiation that is distinct from hematopoiesis.
