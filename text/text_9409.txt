BACKGROUND
many bacterial diseases, including urinary tract infections  are initiated by microorganisms adhering to and colonizing the epithelium. epithelial cells of the urinary tract  respond to pathogens by producing various immune activating substances including compounds that recruit immune cells such as macrophages. epithelial cells express a number of different pattern recognition receptors such as toll-like receptors  that are able to trigger the expression of inflammatory mediators and subsequent inflammation in the presence of pathogenic microbes. one of the most studied tlrs is tlr <dig>  which binds lipopolysaccharides  found on the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . key proteins involved in inflammation are the rel/nuclear factor -κb proteins, which once activated can induce the transcription of several immunologically essential molecules, such as tumor necrosis factor , interleukin - <dig> and cxcl <dig>  <cit> . these cytokines are very important in the antimicrobial and inflammatory process and they effectively recruit immune cells to the infected site. in its inactive form, the nf-κb transcription factor is located within the cytosol, where inhibitory proteins masking the nuclear localization signal impair its nuclear migration. during nf-κb activation, the inhibitory proteins are disassociated from the transcription factor dimer, which is subsequently transported into the nucleus  <cit> . nuclear translocation of nf-κb during infectious processes is important for the subsequent activation of immune responses.

the most prevalent cause of uti is uropathogenic escherichia coli , which expresses numerous virulence factors including toxins and fimbriae used for adhesion. eukaryotic cells can identify pathogens, for example when type  <dig> fimbriae, p-pili, or lps bind to tlr <dig> and elicit an inflammatory response, albeit via different intracellular pathways  <cit> . however, some upec are equipped with virulence factors that can block immune responses allowing the organisms to freely multiply. these upec can act directly on tlr activation, inhibiting nf-κb at an early stage after ligand binding and consequently, there is no transcription of the integral components needed to mount an immune response  <cit> . similarly, a low tlr <dig> expression or activity is associated with increased uti susceptibility. such strategies would impede pathogen clearance in vivo and cause recurrent utis  <cit> .

lactobacillus is a genus of gram-positive bacteria naturally found in the healthy human vagina  <cit>  and urethra  <cit> . moreover, a low lactobacillus count is inversely related to high numbers of e. coli in the vagina and a history of recurrent uti  <cit> . several lactobacilli strains are used as probiotics to prevent infections within the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts as well as to ameliorate allergic and inflammatory conditions  <cit> . the probiotic mechanisms are believed to include the release of antibacterial substances, biosurfactant production, disruption of biofilms and competitive exclusion  <cit> . furthermore, the ability of probiotic strains to modulate immunity through nf-κb and mitogen activated protein  kinase pathways, both important in the development of innate and adaptive immunity, has been reported  <cit> . lactobacillus rhamnosus gr- <dig> is a probiotic isolated from a female urethra  <cit>  used to prevent uti and bacterial vaginosis, and it has both immunomodulatory and antimicrobial activity  <cit> . currently, the immunological effects of lactobacilli on urothelial cells are in large part unexplored. the aim of this current study was to investigate how l. rhamnosus gr- <dig> can affect urothelial immune responses to e. coli.

RESULTS
bladder cells responded poorly to lactobacilli compared to heat-killed e. coli
e. coli are potent activators of epithelial immune responses and were therefore used to stimulate activation of nf-κb and cytokine release from bladder cells. after  <dig> h of challenge with heat-killed e. coli, cells responded with more than 10-fold increase in nf-κb activation compared to resting cells, as measured by the luciferase reporter assay . furthermore, challenge gave a substantial increase in pro-inflammatory tnf, il- <dig>  and cxcl <dig> levels . on the other hand, l. rhamnosus gr- <dig> was a poor activator of nf-κb. stimulation with viable lactobacilli led to a minor increase in the activation of nf-κb while heat-killed bacteria had no significant effect . although viable lactobacilli could marginally increase nf-κb activation compared to resting cells, stimulation did not promote release of any of the tested cytokines . in contrast, it resulted in a small but significant reduction of cxcl <dig>  compared to resting cells, while tnf and il- <dig> levels were unaffected .

lactobacilli do not normally come into contact with bladder cells, therefore we determined the cytotoxicity caused by lactobacilli exposure. however, we did not observe decreased epithelial cell viability compared to resting cells, as determined using propidium iodide stained cells and flow cytometry .

viable lactobacilli potentiated nf-κb activation and cytokine response in e. coli-stimulated cells
bladder cells were relatively indifferent towards stimulation with both viable and heat-killed lactobacilli, whereas the cells responded appropriately towards stimulation with e. coli, leading to increased nf-κb activation and release of inflammatory mediators. co-stimulation with viable lactobacilli and heat-killed e. coli did however result in increased nf-κb activation compared to cells challenged with e. coli alone . this nf-κb induction was beyond an eventual additive effect, representing a synergistic action on nf-κb activation. on the protein level, co-stimulation influenced the release of all studied inflammatory mediators. the tnf release was increased by a factor of two to three, while il- <dig> and cxcl <dig> levels were reduced compared to those found during e. coli challenge alone .

nf-κb activation was significantly reduced when bladder cells were exposed to heat-stable cell wall components of lactobacilli , indicating that potentiation was mediated by compound released during the growth of l. rhamnosus gr- <dig> 

l. rhamnosus gr- <dig> and gg augmented nf-κb to different levels
lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, a well-studied immunomodulatory strain used for gastrointestinal disorders, was chosen to compare nf-κb augmenting abilities. both l. rhamnosus gr- <dig> and gg had the ability to potentiate e. coli induced nf-κb activation . while l. rhamnosus gg induced nf-κb twofold, l. rhamnosus gr- <dig> showed a three- to fourfold induction of nf-κb compared to cells that had no lactobacilli added.

l. rhamnosus gr- <dig> modified tlr <dig> expression on bladder cells
tlr <dig> is a crucial protein in the detection of e. coli by epithelial cells, therefore we proceeded by analyzing the levels of tlr <dig> in bladder cells treated with heat-killed e. coli and l. rhamnosus gr- <dig>  co-stimulated bladder cells showed increased expression of tlr <dig> mrna compared to cells stimulated with e. coli or lactobacilli alone . furthermore, immunoblotting using native proteins showed high band intensity in co-stimulated cells suggesting higher tlr <dig> protein content compared to all other groups . the effect on tlr <dig> protein levels was further characterized using confocal laser microscopy. control cells and cells stimulated with only e. coli or lactobacilli showed no or low tlr expression, whereas cells co-stimulated with both e. coli and l. rhamnosus gr- <dig> demonstrated a substantial increase in the amount of tlr <dig> protein .

polymyxin b suppressed nf-κb augmentation
we continued to characterize the role of tlr <dig> in nf-κb activation by co-stimulation with heat-killed e. coli and lactobacilli. the tlr <dig> activation in bladder cells was inhibited by pretreatment with polymyxin b, a known inhibitor of lps-induced tlr <dig> activation, and thereafter stimulated by e. coli and l. rhamnosus gr- <dig> . polymyxin b significantly inhibited nf-κb activation in cells challenged with both e. coli and lactobacilli although it had no significant effect on nf-κb activation in resting cells and on lactobacilli treated cells. the increased nf-κb activation observed during co-stimulation was completely lost after polymyxin b treatment, demonstrating the involvement of lps and tlr <dig> 

discussion
activation of nf-κb during infection has a profound effect on the expression of multiple targets which guide the maturation of immune responses against invading pathogens  <cit> . recently, much attention has been given to the immunomodulatory activities of the microbiota and various probiotic organisms. studies have shown a l. plantarum probiotic to be effective at modulating immunity through nf-κb and map kinase signaling in a number of cell types including mucosal epithelial cells  <cit> . in this study we showed the immunomodulatory effects of a urogenital probiotic, l. rhamnosus gr- <dig> on human bladder cells. in order to activate the urothelial cell defense mechanisms in a way that resembles the response during a uti, including nf-κb and cytokine release, we challenged the cells with heat-killed e. coli. although only live bacteria are active in the infection process, we wanted to reduce the microbe-to-microbe signaling present between viable bacteria as well as the effects of e. coli metabolites on cell cultures  <cit> . our results showed that bladder cells challenged with heat-killed e. coli and subjected to stimulation with l. rhamnosus gr- <dig> exhibited increased nf-κb activation and tnf release.

the finding that l. rhamnosus does indeed have immunomodulatory properties is not new per se, but most previous experiments have been done using immune cells  <cit> . adjuvant properties of lactobacillus species have been demonstrated in several in vivo models. an l. casei strain boosted immunoglobulin a secretion in a mouse model of salmonella typhimurium infection  <cit> . another effectively potentiated igg responses after subcutaneous vaccination of chickens towards newcastle disease virus and infectious bronchitis virus  <cit> . collectively, these studies provide evidence that lactobacilli can be used for potentiating immune responses in vivo. nevertheless, although tnf was upregulated by l. rhamnosus gr- <dig> treatment, anti-inflammatory properties of lactobacilli are well established  <cit> . in our study, both il- <dig> and cxcl <dig> were modulated differently from tnf, where both were down-regulated after lactobacilli treatment of e. coli-challenged cells. these effects might represent an alternative influence of l. rhamnosus gr- <dig> on epithelial immune function, guided by transcription factors other than nf-κb, such as map kinase/ap- <dig> pathways or post-transcriptional regulation of nf-κb-regulated genes. another possibility is that l. rhamnosus gr- <dig> produces substances that can interfere with cytokine release from the cell or cytokine stability in the extracellular space.

probiotic health benefits have been shown to be somewhat strain specific. in this study, we showed that two strains exhibit different abilities to increase activation of nf-κb. l. rhamnosus gg elicited a weaker potentiation of e. coli-induced nf-κb activation than l. rhamnosus gr- <dig>  heat-killed preparations of l. rhamnosus gr- <dig> marginally augmented nf-κb, in a manner similar to using viable l. rhamnosus gg . it is possible this augmentation is due to surface-associated structures shared by both strains. lactobacilli surface components have previously been shown to modulate nf-κb in a contact-dependent manner  <cit> . t <dig> cells express tlr <dig>  and can recognize lipoteichoic acid  found on the surface of lactobacilli with increased nf-κb activation as a consequence  <cit> . however, since heat-killed lactobacilli only slightly induced nf-κb activation that is not a likely mechanism given that lta is anchored to the gram-positive cell wall. a more probable mechanism is that products released during bacterial growth are responsible for the nf-κb augmentation by l. rhamnosus gr- <dig>  we have previously shown that spent culture supernatant from l. rhamnosus gr- <dig> can augment nf-κb activation in e. coli-challenged t <dig> cells  <cit> . there are no published studies on the identity of the secreted proteins from l. rhamnosus gr- <dig>  however l. rhamnosus gg is known to release a small number of proteins during growth, none of which have an established immunomodulatory effect  <cit> . a comparison of secretory proteins from the two strains might help explain the differences in terms of immune potentiation.

the role of tlr <dig> was evaluated by blocking lps binding to the receptor using polymyxin b, which eliminated the observed nf-kb potentiation. we initially saw that expression of tlr <dig> at genetic and protein levels was increased during co-stimulation compared to controls, or during individual stimulation with e. coli or lactobacilli. although tlr <dig> has lps as a natural ligand, other e. coli components such as pili have been shown to be able to activate tlr <dig>  however, in this study, polymyxin b completely inhibited nf-κb activation in e. coli stimulated cells, therefore pili or other surface structures could not have contributed to this effect  <cit> . we consider that an increased number of tlr <dig> present on the cell facilitated activation by ligands on e. coli and lactobacilli alike.

tlrs are important in uti disease progression, as shown in c3h/hej mice with a mutation in the tlr <dig> gene. after an e. coli infection, these mutant mice have problems removing the pathogens from their urinary tract  <cit> . a recent study scoring tlr <dig> expression levels in healthy control subjects and uti patients showed that the latter have a lower tlr <dig> expression than healthy controls  <cit> . this important feature of tlr <dig> is consistent with the effect that certain e. coli strains expressing immunomodulatory compounds have on tlr signaling and nf-κb activation. the effect of lactobacilli on nf-κb, tnf and tlr <dig> represents one possibility that increases the urothelial immune cell responses. this augmentation might facilitate early detection and clearance of pathogens.

as defined by fao/who, probiotic microbes must be alive when administered in order to confer health benefits  <cit> . the in vitro effects on nf-κb augmentation has been reported to be dependent on lactobacilli viability, since after heat-killing they only had a marginal effect on nf-κb activation in co-stimulation experiments with e. coli. this supports modulation of nf-κb as a potential probiotic mechanism. the ability of probiotic lactobacilli to interfere with upec colonization in the vagina, and thereby the pathogens' ascension into the bladder, could therefore involve immunomodulatory activity, specifically via nf-κb activation.

CONCLUSIONS
the main cause of uti is ascending e. coli that colonizes the vagina, urethra then bladder. to remove unwanted pathogens, the urothelial cells of the mucosa carry specific receptors, such as tlr <dig> that can recognize the most common gram-negative species. once these receptors bind the cognate bacterial ligand, the epithelial cells respond by producing a range of compounds including cytokines that are strongly regulated by the nf-κb transcription factor. the present in vitro study showed that this immune activation could be amplified by probiotic l. rhamnosus gr- <dig>  moreover, augmentation of nf-κb was accompanied by an increase in inflammatory tnf expression. the important recognition molecule tlr <dig> was found to be up-regulated by l. rhamnosus gr- <dig> on both mrna and protein level in cells concomitantly challenged with e. coli. moreover, the blocking agonist binding to tlr <dig> completely inhibited the augmentation of nf-κb by l. rhamnosus gr- <dig>  due to the importance of tlr <dig> in the process of pathogen clearance we suggest that this represents a pathway in which probiotic immunomodulatory lactobacilli work to increase immunity and prevent infections.
