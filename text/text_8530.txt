BACKGROUND
microarray technology provides data in high-dimensional space defined by the size of the genome under investigation. with such high-dimensional data, feature selection methods are essentially classification tools used to identify gene clusters that reveal biologically meaningful relationships  <cit> . a classical use of feature selection analysis  <cit>  is to identify the most discriminating features or dimension in a matrix of microarray data  <cit> . developing new methods to discriminate between sets of microarray data for both dimensions  and features  will improve data mining processes that in turn will lead to the discovery of biologically relevant relationships. in cotton fiber genomics, microarrays provide a robust technology for identifying developmentally regulated genes during cotton fiber morphogenesis in the two major cultivated species, g. barbadense l. cv. pima s <dig>  and g. hirsutum l. cv. tm <dig> . these two species vary in fiber characteristics and yield; g. barbadense offers superior fiber quality properties like length, fineness, and strength, while g. hirsutum is characterized by high yield. breeding programs around the world are working towards developing high-yielding g. hirsutum cultivars with the fiber properties of g. barbadense. in both species, fiber development occurs in four overlapping stages; initiation , elongation , secondary cell wall synthesis , and maturation   <cit> . despite the similarity in timing and duration of developmental stages, however, inherent differences in the developmental programs lead to the production of fiber with discrete phenotypic differences. therefore, elucidating the genetic mechanisms that underlie these differences is crucial to designing strategies for the genetic enhancement of cotton fiber traits with superior pima characteristics. in this respect, transcriptome profiling of developing gb and gh fibers is pivotal to discovering the specific genetic program that drives the development of fiber in these genotypes. of more importance is the identification of the developmental signals that trigger differential regulation of biological processes that yield the discrete gb and gh phenotypes. few studies to date were conducted to study fiber genomics at the developmental level in a single cotton species , and no studies have focused on molecular differences between both species  at the transcriptional level. in our lab, stage-specific developmentally regulated genes during fiber morphogenesis were identified independently in pima and tm <dig> species . in this study, we describe a novel application of feature selection analysis to simultaneously select between both features  and dimensions  of the developmental transcriptome of the two species. this novel application is termed "double feature analysis" as it enables simultaneous selection between features and dimensions in an unsupervised learning context, and therefore differs from more traditional feature selection, which selects within only one variable.

the objectives of this study were to 1) discover the top discriminating genes between the transcriptomes of pima and tm <dig> fibers at the most distant developmental time points using the novel application of double feature selection  analysis, and 2) determine the intersecting genes between developmentally regulated fiber profiles  and the top differentially expressed genes identified by dfs, and to link the intersected genes to specific stages of fiber development.

RESULTS
reliability of the microarray data and design
a double loop microarray design  with dye swap experiments was adopted to profile the transcriptome of developing pima and tm <dig> fibers independently. this design generated  <dig> data points  per gene at each time point, excluding data points from duplicated spots within each array. dye bias, an inherent problem to microarrays, identifies differential expression that is falsely attributed to the nature of the dye rather than to true differences in biological samples. in this study, data from both channels were highly correlated as the pearson correlation coefficients between log <dig> cy <dig> signal intensity versus log <dig> cy <dig> signal intensity of the  <dig> and  <dig> dpa self-hybridization control experiments  <cit>  were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . the linearity between data estimated from direct and indirect hybridizations  for the same comparison was also very high . similarly, there was a strong correlation between data obtained from two indirect routes for the same comparison . therefore, expression data in the transcriptome profiles of pima and tm <dig> developing fibers were reliable and reproducible for interpreting results in a biologically relevant context.

developmentally regulated expression profiles in pima and tm1
in the transcriptome of developing pima and tm <dig> fibers,  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively, were significantly and differentially expressed across developmental stages. normalized to the total number of the genes profiled in this study ,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the genes were found to be specifically regulated in pima and tm <dig>  respectively, while  <dig> % of the genes were regulated in both species. among pima developmentally-regulated genes, k-means clustering produced  <dig> clusters or profiles of co-expressed genes. the expression patterns of these clusters were linked to discrete developmental stages based on the correspondence between the highest level of expression within a cluster and a developmental stage. for instance, genes in clusters one and five were up-regulated only during the fiber elongation stage, and hence, were classified as expansion-associated genes during primary cell wall biogenesis, which represented  <dig> % of the profiled genes . similarly, among the eight clusters of tm <dig> developmentally-regulated profiles, genes in clusters five and eight were assigned an expansion-associated role and comprised  <dig> % of the profiled genes . genes down-regulated during both primary cell wall /fiber expansion and secondary cell wall  synthesis relative to  <dig> dpa were considered to be initiation-specific, which represented  <dig> % and  <dig> % of profiled genes in the pima and tm <dig> transcriptomes, respectively. in general, the percentage of significantly regulated genes associated with each of the developmental stages was slightly higher for all stages in pima than in tm <dig>  except for the cellulose synthesis-associated genes where the reverse was true .

 <dig> up-regulated,  <dig> down-regulated; all percentages in this table were calculated relative to the total number of profiled genes  in this study

differential expression profiles in pima versus tm <dig> fibers
the double feature selection  analysis developed in this study identified discrete time points that distinguished developmental stages both within and between species. the maximum number of differentially expressed genes occurred coincident with peak cellulose synthesis and scw biogenesis at  <dig> dpa in both species. similarly, the greatest genetic distance between any two time points of the two species occurred during  <dig> and  <dig> dpa  corresponding to the pcw/scw transition stage. it was for these reasons these two data points  were used to further characterize the differences between the fiber transcriptomes of pima and tm <dig>  however, three other combinations of time points were found to be highly discriminating between pima and tm <dig> profiles , which might also participate in coding the differences between both species. the top discriminating genes  at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa were identified based on the expression distance between the two species with a cut-off distance of d â‰¥  <dig>  upon clustering, two distinct clusters were created  with an average silhoutte score  <cit>  equal to  <dig>  , which implies a strong assignment of genes to clusters. these two clusters were visualized using singular value decomposition   <cit>  as shown in figure 2b. svd analysis showed that the first three principal components explained 74% of the total variance in the difference of expression levels. cluster one included  <dig> genes that were up-regulated in pima developmental profiles, while the same genes were down-regulated in tm <dig> profiles. cluster  <dig> comprised  <dig> genes that were specifically up-regulated in the tm <dig> developmental profile and down-regulated in pima profile. figure 2b illustrates how distinct the two clusters were from one another, indicating that these two clusters are naturally occurring within the top discriminating gene set. these results reflect the efficiency of double feature selection in mining two independent microarray studies, and extracting naturally-occurring data variances that are biologically relevant.

top discriminating genes partially intersect with developmentally regulated genes
identifying the intersecting genes between developmentally regulated profiles identified by independent analysis of pima and tm <dig> transcripomes and the top discriminating genes identified by dfs serves two purposes: it assesses the level of significance in the top discriminating genes, and identifies species-specific differentially regulated profiles. a custom perl script was developed to identify intersecting genes between the following three data sets: developmentally regulated fiber genes from pima, developmentally regulated fiber genes from tm <dig>  and the dfs top discriminating genes . three intersecting gene sets of interest were generated. set  <dig> includes  <dig> genes that intersect the top differentially expressed genes identified by dfs and developmental profiles , and represents highly-distant differentially expressed genes between developmentally-regulated fiber profiles of pima and tm <dig>  specific to the pima developmental profile, set  <dig> includes  <dig> genes that intersect with the top dfs differentially expressed genes, and were not significantly expressed in tm <dig>  similarly, set  <dig> included  <dig> genes that intersect with tm <dig> developmentally regulated genes and the top dfs differentially expressed genes, and were not significantly expressed in pima . these three gene sets are anticipated to be key to elucidating the genetic mechanisms that underpin phenotypic differences in the physical fiber traits of the two species. the expression patterns of set  <dig> genes in pima fiber were completely opposite to those of tm <dig>  and likely reflect genetic differences in developmental programming that account for the genotypic differences responsible for the fiber phenotype. moreover, the fact that set  <dig> genes are significantly regulated in a manner that is diametrically opposed in the two species suggests that the expression level of these genes might be involved in triggering/stimulation the expression of genes in set  <dig>  and set  <dig> . in this article, functional analysis of genes in set  <dig>  was the main focus of the discussion.

species and stage specific gene profiles
genes in set  <dig> are anticipated to play key roles in fiber morphogenesis and to exert a direct impact on fiber development and the phenotypic differences between pima and tm <dig> fibers, and therefore warrant further investigation within a biologically relevant context. within set  <dig>  three species-specific regulatory trends were identified: genes up-regulated in pima but down-regulated in tm <dig>  up-regulated in tm <dig> and down-regulated in pima, and up-regulated in both species . further dissection of these genes using k-means clustering revealed five species-specific and developmental stage-specific clusters of co-expressed genes . interestingly, the expression profiles of these clusters revealed that a major difference in gene expression dynamics in the developmental programs of pima and tm <dig> occurs mainly in the intervals between  <dig> to  <dig> dpa, and  <dig> to  <dig> dpa. these intervals correspond to the transition period overlapping pcw and scw synthesis, and coincide with the termination of rapid polar elongation and early entry into cellulose biosynthesis and biogenesis of the scw  <cit> , respectively. approximately  <dig> %  of the genes in this data set are of unknown function or annotated as hypothetical proteins. therefore, gene ontology and pathway analyses were limited to  <dig> %  of the genes in set  <dig>  stage-specific and species-specific metabolic/regulatory pathways and molecular functions identified for genes in each cluster specifically characterize each fiber developmental stage at the molecular level. for instance, genes in cluster  <dig> were up-regulated during the synthesis of both pcw and scw in developing pima fibers, while they were down-regulated during the same stages in tm <dig> . in this cluster, sucrose metabolism was the top represented go category  and pathway . this finding highlights the important role of sucrose metabolism in fiber morphogenesis and as a diagnostic marker for the structural properties that distinguish the superior pima fiber phenotype. interestingly, the top represented go category in cluster  <dig> was phenylalanine  metabolism , which included genes up-regulated during pcw synthesis in tm <dig> and scw deposition in pima, but down-regulated during the transition stage pcw/scw in both species . in contrast to pal metabolism, the coumarin biosynthetic pathway, the major pathway in cluster  <dig> , was down-regulated during pima scw biogenesis and up-regulated during the pcw/scw transition stage in tm <dig>  the up-regulation of phenolic synthesis pathways during pcw development and the pcw/scw transition stages in tm <dig> suggests a possible role in curtailing the rate of pcw expansion in tm <dig> relative to developing pima fibers.

discussion
although developmental programming of fiber morphogenesis is very similar in both pima and tm <dig>  species-specific differences in the structure and composition of the cell walls produce discrete fiber phenotypes and fiber quality traits. it is crucial to discover the genes responsible for governing fiber properties, and especially those diagnostic genes of the pima fiber phenotype for the genetic enhancement of fiber quality. the main objective here was to apply a novel application of double feature selection analysis to microarray data as a means for identifying transcriptional differences between developing pima and tm <dig> fibers, and to gain novel insight into the mechanisms that underlie the phenotypic differences. from a global perspective, developmentally regulated genes during fiber morphogenesis only partially overlap in pima and tm <dig>  indicating that discrete genetic mechanisms govern fiber morphogenesis are involved. the higher percentage of the transcriptome that is specifically regulated in developing pima fiber  relative to tm <dig>  is consistent with genetic mapping studies showing a decided bias for pima alleles in interspecific mapping populations  <cit> . moreover, the portions of the transcriptome contributing to each of the developmental stages are higher in pima than in tm <dig> for all stages of fiber development, with the surprising exception of the scw stage, in which  <dig> % of the transcriptome is specific to scw synthesis in tm <dig> as opposed to only  <dig> % in pima . keeping in mind the superiority of pima fiber quality relative to tm <dig> appears to be primarily controlled by cellulose synthesis and associated metabolic processes during the scw biogenesis lends even greater credence to our findings. this study provides the first compelling evidence that developmental programming of fiber morphogenesis in pima and upland cottons are linked to discrete genetic mechanisms that govern the fiber phenotype . such information will prove vital to molecular breeding programs that focus on the genetic enhancement of fiber quality. the identification of developmentally-regulated, stage- and species-specific gene clusters in this study is the first step toward developing a comprehensive understanding of fiber development at the molecular genetics level. moreover, genetic dissection of the fiber transcriptome into stage- and species-specific profiles paves the way for addressing important biological questions in plant cell development and applications in agricultural biotechnology to improve fiber traits.

the novel application of feature selection analysis established that the most distant time points, in terms of gene expression, between pima and tm <dig> development occur at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa . with a small genotype-based variation in developmental timing and duration of the pcw/scw transition stage, the interval between  <dig> and  <dig> dpa represents the general frame for pcw/scw transition stage. the duration of this stage is thought to be species-specific and longer in species that produces longer fibers  <cit> , which will have direct influence in both fiber length and strength. this explains the importance of indentifying top discriminating genes at these two time points between the transcriptome of the two genotypes. based on expression profiles of the fiber transcriptome at these two points, the top discriminating genes  between pima and tm <dig> are naturally classified into pima-specific  and tm1-specific  as identified by k-means clustering and supported by svd analysis . the reliability and biological relevance of the results prove that double feature selection analysis offers a powerful new tool with applications in data mining of microarray data. species-specific regulation patterns represented  <dig> % of the top discriminating genes:  <dig> % of which are pima-specific,  <dig> % tm1-specific, and  <dig> % are regulated in both pima and tm <dig> . the results suggest that genes that intersect in the three data sets are major players of functional importance in fiber developmental programs that in turn, dictate the physical differences between pima and tm <dig> fiber phenotypes. interestingly, expression patterns of set  <dig> genes  in pima fibers are the opposite of the patterns produced in tm <dig>  leading to the speculation that expression of set  <dig> genes influences, either directly or indirectly, the execution of genetic programs encoded by gene sets  <dig>  and  <dig>  in pima and tm <dig>  respectively. therefore, it is possible that differential expression of set  <dig> genes between pima and tm <dig> may trigger or stimulate the expression of genes in sets  <dig> and  <dig> in a species-specific manner. thus, set  <dig> genes may be key to the successful genetic manipulation of cotton fiber traits. further classification of set  <dig> genes identified five species- and stage-specific gene clusters regulated primarily at the transition stage between pcw and scw synthesis, and the early phases of scw biogenesis . functional analysis of these five species- and stage-specific clusters unveiled major pathways that are differentially regulated in pima in contrast to tm <dig> fibers. cotton fiber cell walls are >96% cellulose at maturity and differential regulation of carbohydrate metabolism is no doubt a critical component in determining the fiber phenotype, which in turn, hinges on the structure and composition of the pcw and scw. therefore, the fact that sucrose metabolism  is up-regulated during pcw and scw in pima versus tm <dig> and is associated with higher sucrose synthase activity is an important discovery. sucrose synthase is thought to interact with the cellulose synthase complex to presumably act as a metabolic channel to convert sucrose into glucose via udp-glucose to add sugar moieties to the growing glucan chain during cellulose synthesis  <cit> . therefore, differential expression of sucrose synthase maybe key to the development of superior pima fibers. similarly, phenolic synthesis pathways  are up-regulated during pcw and pcw/scw overlapping stages in tm <dig>  whereas only the pal pathway is up-regulated from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa in developing pima fibers. it was reported that coumarin inhibits cellulose synthesis in both pcw and scw biogenesis in in vitro ovule cultures  <cit> . based on this and our results, we therefore hypothesize that the up-regulation of coumarin biosynthesis pathway inhibits pcw extension in tm- <dig> relative to pima fibers, in which coumarin biosynthesis is down-regulated. increasing pal activities result in elevated levels of ferulic acid , which in turn, may lead to an increase in the level of cell wall-bound diferulic acid to curtail cell wall extensibility during the elongation stage  <cit> . in contrast, the up-regulation of pal activities in the early stages of pima scw biogenesis, suggests a major role in the termination of the cell elongation phase, and in determining important properties such as fiber length. similar results were obtained by wakabayashi et al.  <cit>  where they showed that abscisic acid curtails the extensibility of cell wall of wheat coleoptiles by decreasing cell wall-bound ferulic and diferulic acid.

CONCLUSIONS
the novel application of double feature selection  combined with cluster analyses to mine independent microarray experiments proved effective in discovering new biologically relevant information not previously detected in microarray data. dfs revealed major biological processes that were linked to stage-specific events during cotton fiber development. important metabolic processes, including sucrose metabolism and phenylpropanoid pathways, pal and coumarin, are developmentally and differentially regulated in a genotype-specific manner as well. based on these results, we propose that these processes in particular play a crucial role in a stage-specific manner that in turn, profoundly influence genotypic differences in fiber characteristics.
