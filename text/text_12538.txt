BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar enteritidis  is the world-leading cause of salmonellosis and is often implicated in over 60% of cases of human salmonellosis in europe  <cit> . in the united states it remains the second most common serotype of salmonellae  <cit> . the current worldwide epidemic of s. enteritidis started in the middle of the 1980s  <cit> . the reservoir for s. enteritidis is mainly poultry often carrying asymptomatic infections, which pass the human pathogen along the food production chain. especially undercooked or raw eggs and frozen poultry meat represent a high risk for humans.

s. enteritidis is one of the most clonal salmonella serotype  <cit> . consequently, highly discriminative typing methods are needed for surveillance and outbreak studies. phage typing is the traditional phenotypic method for subtyping salmonellae but has limited discriminative power and requires standardized phage collections  <cit> . molecular-based typing methods like plasmid profiling, rapd and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  have been applied with limited discriminatory power as well  <cit> . ribotyping using the restriction enzymes psti and sphi is currently the most useful method for discrimination  <cit> . however, this method is extremely labor-intensive and difficult to standardize. advances in the polymerase chain reaction  technology has resulted in the development of the multiple-locus variable-number of tandem repeat analysis . it is a new approach to subtype bacteria which involve amplification and fragment size analysis of polymorphic regions of dna containing variable numbers of tandem repeat sequences. this method has been found to be very useful in discriminating between isolates that are highly clonal including various pathogenic species  <cit> . for salmonella, mlva systems for the species enterica  <cit> , for the serotype typhimurium  <cit>  and the serotype enteritidis  <cit>  have been described. several outbreak studies for typhimurium have shown the usefulness of this method to identify the source of infection  <cit>  and were superior to pfge in the discrimination power  <cit> .

here we report a new multicolor mlva method for s. enteritidis which is highly discriminative, fast and easy to use. one multiplex pcr per strain using fluorescently labeled primers is performed and the individual pcr fragment sizes are analysed by a multicolor capillary electrophoresis system. for each locus fragment sizes are assigned to allele numbers as the basis for strain identification. emphasis was given on phage types  <dig>  and  <dig>  which are the most prevalent phage types in europe  <cit>  causing sporadic and outbreak cases. investigations of additional  <dig> isolates sampled from two recent outbreaks showed the correlation with phage typing and other molecular methods.

RESULTS
diversity of s. enteritidis isolates analysed by mlva
two-hundred and forty epidemiologically independent s. enteritidis isolates belonging to  <dig> different phage types were arbitrarily selected and analysed by mlva. all nine vntr loci selected  were specifically amplified in one multiplex pcr using fluorescently labeled primers . afterwards, the products were separated according to their size using the abi <dig> multicolor capillary electrophoresis genetic analyser. altogether  <dig> different allele combinations  have been found among the  <dig> s. enteritidis strains tested. the simpson's diversity index for mlva was  <dig>  and for phage typing  <dig> . the vntr loci sentr <dig>  sentr <dig>  sentr <dig> and se- <dig> showed similar nei's diversity values of  <dig>  . of these in sentr  <dig>  and in senr  <dig>  the highest number of different tandem repeat alleles  were detected. the lowest nei's diversity values were observed for the loci sentr  <dig>  sentr  <dig> and sentr  <dig>  . however, despite the low diversity values these loci were valuable to discriminate strains of certain phage types. particularly, vntr variants in sentr  <dig> occurred in  <dig> of the  <dig> tested pt <dig> isolates and variants in sentr  <dig> were able to discriminate pt <dig>  pt <dig> and pt <dig> isolates. null variants  have been observed for the locus se- <dig> in pt <dig>  pt7a and pt9b, for the locus sentr  <dig> in pt <dig>  and for the locus sentr  <dig> in pt <dig>  pt <dig> and pt9b strains.

twenty-four different mlva types were assigned to the  <dig> pt <dig> strains analysed and  <dig> different types were identified for  <dig> pt <dig> strains analysed. the most frequent type in pt <dig> strains was represented by allele numbers 3-4-2-4-1-3-1-2- <dig>  and in pt <dig> strains the type 2-4-2-6-1-2-2-2- <dig>  predominated. pt <dig> strains with the most frequent mlva type were often isolated from eggs or egg products in northern parts of germany in  <dig> and  <dig>  this indicates probably the spread of a certain clone within egg-laying hens in this region. generally, strains with the same phage type cluster together with similar mlva types with some exceptions. pt <dig> and pt <dig> strains were separated by major branches . twelve out of  <dig> pt <dig> strains tested had the same mlva type 3-4-2-4-1-3-1-2- <dig> as pt <dig> strains. pt <dig> strains have often the same mlva type as pt <dig> strains. the seven pt <dig> strains tested were assigned to six different types but all types were also observed in pt <dig> strains.

outbreak investigations
strains isolated from two different outbreaks were investigated using the mlva protocol to show the applicability  of the mlva method compared to phage typing. the first outbreak occurred in summer  <dig> during a sporting event. after consumption of pastry   <dig> participants developed gastrointestinal symptoms. salmonella isolates have been obtained from stool samples of the patients, from utensils and pastries of the manufacturing pastry shop and the confectioner, who turned out to shed salmonellae  <cit> . altogether  <dig> isolates were analysed by mlva, phage typing, ribotyping and pfge. all isolates were indistinguishable by ribotyping, pfge and mlva. for phage typing all but one isolate showed the same type pt <dig>  the exceptional strain was assigned to rdnc  indicating a phenotypic changes of the strain. the mlva type was assigned to 3-4-2-4-1-3-1-2- <dig>  most frequently found in sporadic pt  <dig> strains tested.

the second outbreak occurred between week  <dig> and  <dig> in  <dig>  <cit> . twenty-eight patients acquired salmonellosis caused by s. enteritidis in a german hospital. at the same time children of a kindergarten were also affected. the kindergarten received its lunch from the same hospital kitchens as the patients in the hospital. it was likely that both outbreaks were caused by contaminated foods prepared in the hospital's kitchen. isolates were obtained from kitchen personnel shedding s. enteritidis, various foods , sick children from the kindergarten, and sick patients from the hospital. thirty-eight isolates were typed by mlva and phage typing. all isolates were indistinguishable in their phage type pt <dig> and mlva type 2-4-2-6-1-2-2-2- <dig>  the most frequent type found in pt <dig>  a common source of infection could not be identified indicating that probably kitchen staff members shedding salmonellae had contaminated foods during preparation and consequently causing the outbreak. alternatively, since the mlva type is frequently associated with isolates from egg products it might be speculate that any contaminated eggs or egg powder were used for food preparation, also affecting staff members in the kitchen. however, suspicious foods for further analysis were not available.

stability of vntr loci
the in vitro stability of the vntr loci was tested by freeze-thaw subculturing cycles of single colonies of strains 07– <dig>  and 07– <dig> . one single colony of each strain was frozen in glycerol at -80°c. ten cycles of freezing and thawing were performed . afterwards, a subculture was grown on luria-bertani agar and five single colonies were picked and each frozen again in glycerol at -80°c. after repeating  <dig> cycles of freezing and thawing the five subcultures were grown on luria-bertani agar again and ten single colonies were picked from each subculture. all  <dig> samples of one strain were determined in the mlva. the results showed indistinguishable mlva types as the original strain.

discussion
we report the first mlva multicolor capillary electrophoresis method for the high-resolution discrimination of s. enteritidis isolates. in europe over 60% of human salmonellosis cases are caused by s. enteritidis and the serotype is considered as highly clonal group. a multiplex pcr has been developed to amplify nine vntr loci of the s. enteritidis genome simultaneously. the primers were labeled with the dyes 6-fam, hex or tet for the accurate assignment of individual pcr products to a specific vntr locus after multicolor capillary electrophoresis. the geneflo- <dig> marker  modified by an additional  <dig> bp-size fragment has been used as internal size standard. the additional fragment is necessary because pcr products of the se- <dig> locus might reach sizes up to  <dig> bp. alternatively, the commercial size marker mapmarker  <dig>  could be used which consists of  <dig> discrete dna fragments ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> base pairs. preliminary results showed no significant difference of pcr product sizes between both markers.

in most cases, isolates with the same phage type grouped together with some exceptions . it has been observed that strains of different phage types can exhibit the same mlva type. this has been observed, for example for strains with the phage type  <dig>  1b,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  5a,  <dig>  and  <dig> . therefore, the method is not necessarily suitable to predict the phage types. this has been also shown for the well-evaluated s. typhimurium mlva method according to lindstedt et al.  <cit> . consequently, the combination of traditional phage typing and the new mlva typing can lead to an even higher typing resolution for s. enteritidis.

to evaluate the discriminatory power of the mlva method the focus was given on the phage types pt <dig> and pt <dig>  both types play a predominant role in the epidemiology of s. enteritidis  <cit> . the mlva method showed an excellent discrimination within these phage types similar to or higher than two restriction enzyme ribotyping as previously described  <cit> . the major advance of this mlva method compared to ribotyping is its easy use, lower cost and rapidity making it valuable for outbreak studies. in addition, the exchange of data for comparative studies between laboratories is very easy as demonstrated for s. typhimurium mlva  <cit> .

boxrud et al.  <cit>  have also recently published a mlva method for s. enteritidis using ten vntr loci amplified in individual pcr reactions. this mlva was recently optimized using a multiplex pcr for seven vntr loci followed by a single color electrophoresis using a beckman ceq  <dig> automated dna sequencer  <cit> . however, only  <dig> s. enteritidis strains were tested representing a maximum of variety. due to the use of a single color electrophoresis system it is questionable if pcr products variable in sizes can be reliably assigned to the correct vntr locus. several vntr loci used by boxrud et al.  <cit>  were independently selected by the mlva method presented here. however, the loci sentr <dig> and sentr <dig> were not previously described by boxrud et al.  <cit> . the locus sentr <dig> was previously described as sttr <dig> by lindstedt et al.  <cit> . despite the low diversity index determined for these loci in regard to all  <dig> s. enteritidis strains tested, they were useful for achievement a better diversity within pt <dig> and pt <dig> isolates.

the analysis of salmonella isolates belonging to two outbreaks have shown that during the course of each outbreak a stable mlva type was obtained. the results were in congruence with other molecular typing methods  and phage typing. in addition, the determination of the in vitro stability by doing multiple freezing thawing cycles of glycerol stock cultures revealed no changes in the mlva type. hopkins et al.  <cit>  observed for s. typhimurium mlva sporadically single-locus variants in strains isolated from different outbreaks. this might indicate that small changes in loci are rather likely in s. typhimurium than in s. enteritidis supported by the knowledge that the serotype s. enteritidis is less diverse in genotypic properties than the serotype s. typhimurium. hopkins et al.  <cit>  proposed for s. typhimurium to define the cut-off to allow the classification of strains as part of an outbreak as a difference of two repeats at one or fewer loci. this rule might be adapted for s. enteritidis to only one repeat in one locus because of its clonality. however, the analysis of more outbreaks is needed to determine the hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the mlva method for high-resolution of s. enteritidis isolates presented here offers a simple, robust and cheap tool for surveillance, outbreak studies and short-term tracing of bacteria in the food chain. data can easily be shared between laboratories by a standardized allele string or mlva type number which is an important advantage for outbreak studies occurring in several countries. the in vivo and in vitro stability of the vntr loci indicate less frequent changes in the number of tandem repeats than shown for s. typhimurium. this might reflect the rather clonal genome structure of this common serotype.
