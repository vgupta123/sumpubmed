BACKGROUND
olive , of worldwide economic importance, has high intra-specific genetic variation with a genome size of about  <dig>  mb  <cit> . this feature serves to analyze biological processes of biotechnological interest such as phenolic and lipid metabolism during fruit development  as well as terpenoids and sterols  <cit> . directly or indirectly, these processes all affect the quality of olive oil as well as its nutritional profile. the genomic data on olive is augmenting through advances in mapping the olive genome  <cit> , and the dna of the whole plastome of ‘frantoio’, an italian cultivar, has been sequenced  <cit> . also, sequencing of the olive genome has been undertaken in italy through the project olea . concomitantly, a number of large datasets of expressed sequence tag  datasets have recently been reported for olive, generating  <dig>  ests  <cit>  and  <dig>  ests  <cit>  employing the  <dig> pyrosequencing technologies, an additional  <dig>  ests with the use of suppression subtractive hybridization  <cit> , as well as  <dig> million ests using sanger and  <dig> pyrosequencing technologies  <cit> , this being important for extending the catalog of olive transcripts in order to facilitate gene discovery, functional analysis, and molecular breeding.

fruit ripening, abscission and senescence are key physiological events that occur during the growth and development of higher plants. these bear commercial implications both for the plant and the harvest. in agricultural research, the manipulation of genes governing these phenomena is key in order to develop varieties that can produce fruits with longer shelf lives as well as crops that tolerate greater environmental stress. given that several genes are involved in these processes, the manipulation of complex traits such as ripening, abscission, and senescence is not feasible using single genes, and therefore efforts are being focused on specific transcription factors  that control entire pathways  <cit> .the development of olive fruit involves complex processes following a double sigmoidal growth curve which lasts for 4-5 months and is influenced by numerous factors, including genotype  <cit> . olive-fruit properties at the time of harvest, including the final mix of primary and secondary metabolites that accumulate during ripening, largely determine the quality of the resulting oil and fruit. recent transcriptomic and metabolic studies have demonstrated changes taking place during the development of the olive-fruit and the beginning of ripening  <cit> . progress in determining the transcriptome of the olive in terms of functional annotation and the assignment of gene ontology have made it possible to accurately describe of differences in gene expression between olive tissues  <cit> . however, transcriptome information of the olive fruit at full ripening has not yet been determined.

after fruit ripening, many fruit-tree species undergo massive natural fruit abscission. in olive, abscission of mature fruit depends on the activation of the abscission zone  located between the pedicel and fruit, and the patterns of mature fruit abscission differ between cultivars  <cit> . in some olive cultivars , fruit ripening associated events lead finally to the abscission of the ripe fruit from the pedicel, this taking place at 217 days post-anthesis   <cit> . in a previous study, we reported the comparison of the picual fruit az transcriptomes at two different stages  using the rna-seq technique; 148 mb of sequences  resulted and  <dig>  differentially expressed genes were identified from these two samples  <cit> . among the  <dig> tf genes induced during mature-fruit abscission in the olive az, the classes that are well represented included bzip proteins, myb proteins, and homeobox domain proteins  <cit> . the comparison between az and fruit allow us to restrict the set of genes putatively related to the abscission, and in this direction the results may hold worthwhile perspectives for the study of this process. cross-talk between the two tissues may involve different components of the signaling network, such as tfs and other signaling molecules, playing either direct or indirect roles. however, molecular-genetic information on the relationship between ripe fruit and az is still very limited. in this study, using  <dig> pyrosequencing technology, we analyzed the overall transcriptional profile of olive  fruit pericarp at full ripening to significantly expand the olive transcript catalog. we focused on comparing the transcriptomes generated from pericarp and az tissues of ripe fruit to establish the divergences as well as similarities in transcriptional networks, and especially to characterize the biological processes and transcriptional regulators enriched in gene clusters that are differentially regulated. here, we found a total of  <dig>  ests assembled into  <dig>  isotigs, for which we made extensive annotations. in total, we identified  <dig>  differentially expressed genes  in ripe fruit and az, and characterized their biological functions using gene ontology  annotation and kegg pathway analysis. the results from this study show that distinct patterns of transcriptional regulation occurs among ripe fruit and their az in olive, identifying common and distinct tfs that have not been previously related to fruit ripening or abscission.

RESULTS
 <dig> sequencing of olive transcriptomes
to characterize olive transcriptomes and generate expression profiles between fruit ripening and abscission, roche/ <dig> gs-flx  pyrosequencing technology was used to sequence two cdna samples from fruit pericarp and the az, which were collected from olive  fruits at the ripe stage , when abscission occurs . after the cdna libraries were prepared, their pyrosequencing was finished, and initial quality filtering was performed with the default parameters. the runs gave a total of  <dig>  high-quality sequence reads for fruit pericarp, and  <dig>  high-quality sequence reads for az . thus, a total of  <dig>  high-quality ests were found for the two study samples. additional file  <dig> offers a general view of the sequencing and assembly processes which provides the length distribution for these high-quality reads. although many reads were very short , over 80% were  <dig> to 500 bp in length. we assembled these sequences into  <dig>  contigs  grouped into  <dig>  isotigs  . the average length of the contigs was around  <dig> bases and most of the contigs had fewer than  <dig> reads . we assembled most of the high-quality reads  into longer contigs, implying high coverage for these sequencing data. we then found over  <dig>  uniprot identities using blast analysis on the sequences assembled . some 40% of the isotigs failed to map to uniprot identities, thus constituting a source to discover new genes.figure  <dig>

comparison of olive transcriptomes between fruit and az tissues
to investigate ripening-abscission distinctions, we compared the transcriptomes of olive fruit and az at full ripening . read amounts for each of the  <dig>  annotated isotigs  lead to the identification of  <dig>  transcripts in our experiment , which  <dig>  were differentially expressed genes ; hereafter, these are called group i , whereas the other genes  having either low read abundance or non differential representation are called group ii . thus, the comparative analysis of the transcription profiles conducted in pericarp and az of ripe fruit evidenced that a huge number of genes are differentially expressed in fruit and az. of these  <dig>  degs ,  <dig>  showed a higher expression in the fruit pericarp, while  <dig>  were overexpressed in the az at  <dig> dpa . a comparison of the degs indicated that  <dig>  genes of these were common in both tissues, whereas  <dig> degs were expressed only in fruit , and  <dig>  degs were expressed exclusively in az at  <dig> dpa  . thus, we identified a large number of fruit and az genes, implying that they participate in physiological processes exclusive to certain tissues.figure  <dig>

to determine which cell processes might be critical in the last stage of fruit ripening in both tissues, we grouped transcripts by their expression signatures in both samples. for group i genes, hierarchical cluster analysis enabled us to identify  <dig> major clusters, called a and b. cluster a had the  <dig>  most abundant transcripts in fruit-pericarp at  <dig> dpa, while cluster b bore the  <dig>  most abundant transcripts in fruit-az at  <dig> dpa. subsequently, we split these two clusters into two subclusters,  and , respectively . we present volcano plots for each hierarchal cluster group and identify gene with both high fold change and significance . subcluster a <dig> had  <dig> transcripts, which were more abundant in the fruit-pericarp sample with lower expression levels in the fruit-az sample at  <dig> dpa . meanwhile, cluster a <dig> contained the  <dig> expressed transcripts exclusively in the fruit-pericarp sample at  <dig> dpa . in the fruit-az sample, cluster b <dig> had the  <dig> most abundant transcripts and lower expression levels in the fruit-pericarp sample at  <dig> dpa , whereas cluster b <dig> included the  <dig>  exclusively expressed transcripts in the fruit-az sample at  <dig> dpa .figure  <dig>

for each cluster, the most abundant transcripts appear in table  <dig>  for the fruit-enriched transcripts, the greatest differential expression was found for a transcript participating in abscisic acid  stress ripening , and a transcript coding for β-glucosidase involved in carbohydrate metabolic process, suggesting that such ripening processes as cell-wall alterations occur in fruit-pericarp at the last stages of olive ripening. also, a significantly higher expression in ripe fruit vs. az tissues was found for an aco <dig>  and etr <dig>  involved in ethylene biosynthesis and perception, respectively, suggesting that aco <dig> as well as etr <dig> may be instrumental in balancing ethylene biosynthesis needs with ethylene signaling requirements to full ripening in olive-pericarp. another transcript coding for thaumatin-like protein, which is developmentally regulated particularly in fruits during ripening, but is also induced in response to biotic or abiotic stress  <cit>  revealed a fruit-enriched expression pattern. also, tubulins beta chain revealed a fruit-enriched expression pattern, signifying that activation of vesicle trafficking involving these tubulins may take part in fruit-pericarp during fruit ripening. on the other hand, the genes that encode anthocyanidin synthase,  <dig> -dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase, and alpha-expansin  <dig>  were the genes most highly expressed among those expressed exclusively in olive fruit compared to az . a key component in the riboflavin pathway,  <dig> -dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase or coronatine insensitive <dig> suppressor  is involved in jasmonic acid mediated signaling pathway  <cit> . this suggests that cos <dig> may participate in jasmonate signaling to regulate olive ripening, but not to regulate abscission of mature fruit. previous works have shown that in many crops  the anthocyanin content in fully ripe fruit correlates well with the cumulative expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes. in the present study, it was found that expression of anthocyanidin synthase was up-regulated in fruit-pericarp at full ripe stage, suggesting the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis by anthocyanidin synthase in the late olive-ripening stage. in addition, the strong up-regulation of exp <dig> indicates that this expansin plays a major role in cell-wall alterations involved in olive ripening.table  <dig>

among the most abundant az-enriched transcripts, we identified a homolog of sth- <dig>  , encoding a pathogenesis-related protein , which are observed in the olive az during the induction of mature-fruit abscission  <cit> . however, further work is necessary to ascertain the biological significance of pathogenesis-related gene expression in the olive az during abscission. in pea, there is an accumulation of sth <dig> homologs during late embryogenesis  <cit> , and in craterostigma plantagineum during rehydration of desiccated plants  <cit> . in addition, a homolog of pap <dig> , encoding a purple acid phosphatase  induced to phosphate limitation  <cit> , and a homolog of glutamine synthetase, were very significantly expressed in fruit-az compared to fruit-pericarp tissue, indicating a role for these proteins in intercellular transport during mature-fruit abscission. paps, metallophosphoesterases that contain a bimetal nucleus in their active center  <cit> , were involved in plant tolerance to phosphate limitation  <cit> . previous experiments showed that, in phloem companion cells, glutamine synthetase activity affects proline levels  <cit> . the predominant expression of glutamine synthetase suggests redistribution of proline within the az during abscission. among the most abundant az genes , cell wall-related genes were detected. this was expected because the main changes in texture related to cell separation result from enzyme-mediated structural and compositional changes in the cell wall. this includes, for example, a beta- <dig> -glucanase, which catalyze the hydrolysis of β- <dig> -glucan linkages of callose, as well as participating in many processes including cell-wall remodeling, secondary-wall formation, and phytohormone activation  <cit> . reportedly, abscission induction is accompanied by the marked up-regulation of a gene that encodes β- <dig> -glucanase, as well as the down-regulation of a gene that encodes a callose synthase in the fruit-az  <cit> . this activation of beta- <dig> -glucanase was stronger in olive az, showing that this phenomenon is related to fruit abscission in olive. also, one gene associated with nitrate transport is among az genes, suggesting the function of nitrate as an important ion for fruit abscission.

gene ontology functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes
to provide a general view on the functions and processes that change in fruit and az at the last stage of ripening, we classified the differentially expressed genes using the gene ontology  database. in addition, based on their sequence similarities, we assigned go accessions to the differentially expressed genes to identify the proteins in the uniprot database annotated with go accessions in addition to the interpro and pfam domains they contained. among the  <dig>  annotated isotigs,  <dig>  were designated at least one go term . the go terms “oxidation reduction”, “oxidoreductase activity”, and “membrane” were the most represented ones among the biological process , molecular function , and cellular component categories , respectively.figure  <dig>

also go terms were identified in the category of biological processes that proved to be over-represented in the lists of genes that showed higher expression in ripe fruit and az tissues, respectively . these go terms constitute indicators of different biological processes that two different tissues underwent in the last stage of ripening. a number of go classifications proved to be over-represented in genes which had augmented transcript accumulation in fruit at the last stage of ripening. the over-represented group in fruit at  <dig> dpa having the greatest number among the differentially expressed genes was “oxidation reduction”, “metabolic process”, “transport”, “transmembrane transport”, “protein amino acid phosphorylation”, “glycolysis” and “carbohydrate metabolic process” . remarkably, the az at  <dig> dpa also bore a significant representation of transcripts associated with “metabolic process”, “oxidation reduction”, “regulation of transcription”, “transmembrane transport”, “transport”, and “protein amino acid phosphorylation” . thus, go terms including “oxidation reduction”, “transport”, “transmembrane transport”, “protein amino acid phosphorylation”, and “carbohydrate metabolic process”, were enriched in both lists of genes , indicating that the same biological processes might necessitate different gene sets in two different tissues during full ripening and abscission to support their activities. sharp differences nevertheless appeared between the two lists of enriched go terms. notably, go terms associated with aromatic amino acid family biosynthetic process, lignin catabolic and biosynthetic process, isoprenoid biosynthetic process, protein amino acid dephosphorylation, amino acid transport, photosynthesis, auxin signaling pathway, apoptosis, defense responses, and responses to stresses were highly enriched in genes more highly expressed in the olive az, while differences with respect to other enriched go terms included atp synthesis coupled proton transport, glycolysis, and plant-type cell-wall organization which underwent enrichment in genes of higher expression in ripe fruits, suggesting that such biological processes may be associated with ripening-abscission distinctions.

the profile of abundant transcripts in olive ripe fruit  indicates a predominant expression of proteins related to “oxidoreductase activity”, “catalytic activity”, “transferase activity”, “hydrolase activity”, as well as, “nucleotide binding”, “metal-ion binding”, and “atp binding”, while the “catalytic activity”, “transferase activity”, and “metal-ion binding” go term was the most over-represented term for the genes in the olive az at  <dig> dpa . differences of other enriched go terms included 2-alkenal reductase activity, acyltransferase activity, amino acid transmembrane transporter activity, antiporter activity, drug transmembrane transporter activity, phosphoprotein phosphatase activity, atp binding, calcium-ion binding, dna binding, heme binding, and zinc-ion binding which proved to be enriched in genes that showed higher expression in az, while acetyl-coa carboxylase activity, cysteine-type endopeptidase activity, and hydrogen ion transmembrane transporter activity, which were found to be enriched in genes more abundantly expressed in ripe fruit.

finally, within the “cellular compartment” category, the “membrane”, “integral to membrane” and “cytoplasm” go terms constituted the most overrepresented category for the genes with increased transcript accumulation in ripe fruit at  <dig> dpa . the distribution of gene functions  in the fruit and the az transcriptomes were largely similar, especially in the categories of molecular function and metabolism, but also different gene functions. these annotations constitute a useful resource for research on gene function, cellular structures, and processes in the two tissues studied.

metabolic pathways in the last stage of fruit ripening
the olive transcriptomes at the last stage of fruit ripening from our experiment provide the means to examine metabolic and other pathways which differ between the two tissues during this process. go enrichment identified metabolic pathways that may be key to the last stage of fruit ripening and abscission. to delineate these metabolic pathways further, we mapped the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes   <cit>  database to the annotations in our transcript data. of the  <dig>  detected proteins in our experiment,  <dig>  were annotated with  <dig>  enzyme commission  codes and mapped to  <dig> different kegg pathways .

go term representation of all differentially expressed genes between fruit and az tissues at  <dig> dpa is shown in figure  <dig>  this revealed significantly enriched pathways: biosynthesis of secondary metabolites , microbial metabolism in diverse environments , starch and sucrose metabolism , amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism , cysteine and methionine metabolism , methane metabolism , glycolysis/gluconeogenesis , glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism , and arginine and proline metabolism .figure  <dig>

transcription factors in olive fruit at the late stage of ripening
of  <dig>  differentially expressed genes,  <dig> genes putatively encoding tf of diverse families were differentially expressed in olive az compared to fruit at  <dig> dpa . the majority of these were induced in az . overall,  <dig> genes had peak read amounts within cluster a , and  <dig> genes within cluster b . within cluster a, the most abundant tfs proved to be a mads-box domain protein  detected within subcluster a <dig> . indeed, mads-box proteins were the most abundant tfs in ripe fruit, two in subcluster a <dig>  and one in subcluster a <dig> , implying coordinated regulation of this class of tfs in ripe fruit . however, in cluster a the well-represented classes included homeobox domain proteins, zinc finger  proteins, basic helix-loop-helix  proteins, and basic leucine zipper  proteins. cluster a <dig> is enriched in the mads-box and zf tf families , whereas cluster a <dig> was rich in the bhlh, homeobox, zf and bzip families . the control of fleshy-fruit ripening involves many different tfs. in climacteric as well as non-climacteric fruits, a number of mads-box genes reportedly regulate fruit development and ripening  <cit> . master regulators in tomato are hb-box , mads-box , sbp-box , and nac genes  <cit> . a series of tfs, homologous to several of these master regulators, appear in ripe olive fruit .figure  <dig> 
differentially expressed tf genes and classification of tf families. comparison of significantly overexpressed tf transcripts between fruit  and az  at  <dig> dpa. number of transcripts related to tfs in each tf family. the  <dig> tf genes were classified into  <dig> tf families.



similarly, the well represented classes in az tissue at the late stage of ripening  included zf proteins, homeobox domain proteins, bhlh proteins, and bzip proteins . cluster b <dig> is enriched in zf proteins and homeobox domain proteins , whereas cluster b <dig> was found to be rich in the bhlh and bzip families . thus, although two clusters containing members from several tf families, in each cluster, clearly significant difference was found in the proportion of families. moreover, there are distinct tf families in each cluster: the aux/iaa, c2h2l, camta families in cluster a, and the hsf, gras, gaga-binding protein, ein3/eil, e2f/dp, ccaat-binding protein and wrky families in cluster b . the enrichment of sequence elements in different gene groups from each cluster in combination with data on transcript abundance offer a tenable set of tfs which could bind these elements and that could be examined in future research.

among the az-overexpressed tf types, hsf proteins, gras proteins, gaga-binding protein, e2f/dp protein, and wrky proteins were abundantly represented in the olive az during mature-fruit abscission  <cit> . the diversification and functional interaction of hsfs is known, as is their integration into the complex stress signaling and response networks of plants  <cit> , and, a hsf-like tf, tbf <dig>  have been identified as a key molecular mechanism for plant growth-to-defense transition  <cit> . in our analysis,  <dig> hsf tfs were exclusively overexpressed in olive-az , supporting the idea that an increase of these hsf genes might be associated with mature-fruit abscission in olive az. transcriptional regulators belonging to the gras family have been related to plant growth and development, as well as to biotic and abiotic stress  <cit> . also, we report that several gras tfs, including homologs of gra <dig>  gras <dig>  gras <dig>  and gras <dig> , are exclusively overexpressed in the olive az , suggesting that these gras tfs probably mediate abscission-responsive transcription. ever since gaga-binding proteins were identified and characterized in plants, few advances have been made in explaining their function. another up-regulated gene in olive-az was a homolog of bbr/bpc <dig> , a gaga-binding transcriptional activator , indicating that this family control transcriptional activation of homeotic genes, probably started by ethylene, which potentially leads to the activation of abscission-related proteins in the olive az. e2f/dp family of tfs having critical and antagonistic functions in pathways involved in dna repair, cell division, and differentiation. in olive, e2f <dig>  encoding a key component of the cyclin d/retinoblastoma/e2f pathway that is a potent activator of e2f-responsive genes in arabidopsis  <cit> , was highly expressed during mature-fruit abscission in the az  <cit> . here, we also identified one member of e2f family exclusively overexpressed in the az . wrky proteins are known to have a key part in plant defense against several types of biotic stress, developmental processes, and certain signal-transduction processes that are plant-hormone mediated   <cit> . notably, our analyses have revealed that  <dig> wrky genes  are exclusively over-regulated in the olive az, which it is consistent with previous studies where the expression of some wrky genes are induced during floral abscission  <cit>  and mature-fruit abscission  <cit> . thus, our data corroborate that, in the olive az, tfs belonging to these families may potentially help trigger the transcriptional cascade. further study would be needed to reveal the molecular basis of gene expressional regulation.

among the  <dig> tf genes induced in ripe fruit ,  <dig> were exclusively expressed in fruit . we found it useful to consider these “fruit tfs”  separately from  <dig> “fruit-enriched” tfs , which were upregulated in ripe fruit compared to az at  <dig> dpa. the  <dig> genes encode  <dig> zf proteins,  <dig> homeobox proteins,  <dig> bhld domain class tfs,  <dig> bzip, one mads-box tf , one myb tf , one nac tf, one aux/iaa  protein, one camta tf, and one c2h2l tf . this finding suggests that tfs from these families have potentially important roles in mediating late events during olive ripening. similarly, among the  <dig> tf genes induced in the az at  <dig> dpa , most of them  were exclusively expressed in the az compared to the ripe fruit . these genes encoding  <dig> bzip family tfs,  <dig> bhlh family tfs,  <dig> zf proteins,  <dig> mads-box family tfs,  <dig> homeobox family tfs,  <dig> wrky family tfs,  <dig> nac family tfs,  <dig> ap2/erf family tfs,  <dig> myb family tfs,  <dig> heat shock factor  proteins,  <dig> gras proteins, one ein3/eil protein, one e2f protein and one ccaat protein, among others . the  <dig> most differentially overexpressed genes in the olive az encoding tfs were mybpa <dig> , one wrky , myb108-like protein  <dig> , one zf , one myb , one bzip , nac <dig> tf , one hsf , wrky <dig> protein  and short vegetative phase mads-box protein  . abundant genes encoding putative tfs in the az support the contention that a key role is played by transcription regulation during abscission in olive  <cit> . thus, among all tf genes expressed differentially between the two tissues; only  <dig> genes were found to be expressed preferentially in ripe fruit and  <dig> genes in az .figure  <dig>

a total of  <dig> zf proteins within our analysis show this class of tf to be among the most represented both in ripe fruit and in az tissues . indeed, a zp gene, atzfp <dig> <cit> , reportedly has delayed flower senescence as well as abscission, but atzfp <dig> has been shown to participate with dna binding with one finger  in suppressing pgazat expression  <cit> . according to our data,  <dig> of out  <dig> zf genes  are among the over-regulated tfs in the olive az, supporting the coordinated action of zf proteins in the az during fruit abscission. the majority of bhlh proteins identified to date have been functionally characterized in arabidopsis, but, in other plant species, a low number of bhlh genes have been functionally characterized  <cit> . these genes serve to regulate carpel, anther, and epidermal-cell development, as well as flavonoid biosynthesis, phytochrome signaling, hormone signaling, stress responses, and fruit dehiscence  <cit> . gene transcription is known to be regulated by myb transcription factors in combination with bhlh proteins, which include certain myc transcription factors. in this sense, myb and myc  proteins interact to form multi-protein complexes  <cit> . reportedly, myb and bhlh proteins in arabidopsis, cooperate in ttg1-dependent transcriptional regulation  <cit> . also, our results demonstrate over-regulation in the olive az of  <dig> out of  <dig> myb genes identified , and  <dig> out of  <dig> bhlh genes identified . we cannot rule out the possibility that these bhlh proteins, including myc <dig> , constitute an interaction partner for these myb tfs for the regulation of genes needed for processes downstream in the az during fruit abscission. further research is necessary to ascertain whether these bhlh tfs act together with myb proteins in the olive az. in this context, homo-and heterodimers formed by bzip transcription factors are key in the regulation of development and defense responses  <cit> . also, bzip tfs are members of tfs families abundantly represented in the olive az . among those are hy <dig> and rf2a genes, which were induced in the olive az compared with ripe fruit , and were induced also in melon az during early induction of mature-fruit abscission  <cit> . hy <dig> is known to mediate the light response  <cit> , whereas rf2a and rf2b functions may be involved in biotic or abiotic stress response or signaling  <cit> . three tga-type bzip genes have been proposed as governing abscission and regulating abscission-related gene expression  <cit>  as well as up-regulation of the genes bzip <dig>  bzip <dig>  bzip <dig>  bzip <dig>  bzip <dig>  and vip <dig> in the olive az during mature-fruit abscission  <cit> . in this light, bzip proteins appear to be positive regulators in abscission signaling. in addition, most nac proteins were also overexpressed in the olive az in comparison with ripe fruit . previously, we have found that  <dig> genes homologous to nac tfs  showed enhanced expression during mature-fruit abscission  <cit> , as also reported during the immature-fruit abscission in apple  <cit> . this finding is noteworthy because transcriptome analyses have recently demonstrated regulation by a nac transcription factor family. this is not restricted to biotic and abiotic stress responses, but also affects numerous other processes, including senescence, aba signaling and fruit ripening  <cit> .

to validate our rna-seq results, we performed quantitative real time pcr  to determine the levels of expression in eight olive genes taken from the list of tf genes differentially expressed across ripe fruit and az. three genes, bhlh , ag <dig>  and zf , were identified as being overexpressed in ripe fruit in rna-seq data analysis and thus were designated for further confirmation . similarly,  <dig> genes, erf <dig> , mybpa <dig> , myb <dig> , nac  and myb/at3g <dig> , were identified as being overexpressed in az in rna-seq data analysis and were assigned to further confirmation .figure  <dig>

the qrt-pcr analysis confirmed the enrichment bhlh, ag <dig> and zf genes in ripe fruit and the enrichment of erf <dig>  mybpa <dig>  myb <dig>  nac and myb/at3g <dig> genes in the olive az. notably, the expression of erf <dig>  mybpa <dig>  myb <dig>  nac and myb/at3g <dig> were not detected in fruit , and the expression of bhlh, ag <dig> and zf were not detected in az . thus, the qrt-pcr expression results correlated with the rna-seq expression data for the genes tested. in addition, we used qrt-pcr analysis for the expression profiles of eight tfs in olive fruit and az during fruit ripening and abscission . the expression of bhlh and zf increased 3-fold and 1-fold in olive fruit, respectively, during ripening, while ag <dig> expression decreased  <dig> -fold during ripening , implying that these genes are involved in ripening events. on the other hand, transcripts of mybpa <dig>  myb <dig>  nac and myb/at3g <dig> accumulated during abscission in olive az, whereas the expression of erf <dig> was decreased in olive az during abscission . hence, the expression pattern of some genes in olive fruit or az, performed by qrt-pcr, are shown to represent the transcriptome related to fruit ripening or the transcriptome related to the activation of abscission.

CONCLUSIONS
we performed  <dig> transcriptome sequencing and de novo assembly for two tissues, ripe fruit and az, of olea europaea. as a result, we describe transcriptomic differences between the ripe fruit and this az occurring at last stage of ripening in olive as well as potential new genes generated. changes in gene transcripts were accompanied by changes in expression of tfs, especially those in the tfs mads-box, zf, homeobox domain proteins, bhlh, and bzip families, that putatively may trigger the cross-talk between fruit and az. our results indicate that genes encoding members of aux/iaa, c2h2l, and camta families were preferentially transcribed in ripe fruit. by contrast, tf genes of the hsf, gras, gaga-binding protein, ein3/eil, e2f/dp, ccaat-binding protein, and wrky families were preferentially transcribed in az. furthermore, by quantitative real-time pcr analysis, we confirmed the mrna-seq results for eight tf genes. this result implies that the study of those tfs associated with the expression pattern observed in ripe fruit could open major biological pathways governing gene-expression regulation in ripe fruit. these data supply the first comprehensive and comparative molecular information for understanding the expression differences in these tissues.
