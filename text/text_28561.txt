BACKGROUND
the transition from water to land is a fascinating evolutionary issue. the realm change occurred several times and across different taxa, from microorganisms to lichens and green plants, and later, arthropods, mollusks, annelids and vertebrates  <cit> . the multiple transitions required modifications on several systems and organs previously adapted to aquatic habitats. for example, the presence of internal gas exchangers  to uptake oxygen, or different skin modifications as cuticle and keratin layers to decrease evaporation rates. other examples include the production of novel compounds  to excrete nitrogen, and the presence of a skeleton and thick body muscles to support the body mass  <cit> .

the vast majority of mollusks are marine, but several lineages within the clade gastropoda have conquered freshwater and terrestrial habitats  <cit> , e.g., neritimorpha, cyclophoroidea, littorinoidea, rissooidea, and panpulmonata  <cit> . most terrestrial mollusks belong to the clade panpulmonata   <cit> . the invasion of the non-marine realms in panpulmonata occurred multiple times independently in the clades ellobioidea, hygrophila, stylommatophora and systellommatophora . for this reason, panpulmonates are a suitable model to study parallel adaptations to new environments, in particular to land.

examples from invertebrates like the collembola  showed that adaptive changes during terrestrialization have probably occurred in genes related to ion transport, homeostasis, immune response and development  <cit> . on the other hand, several examples from vertebrates showed various molecular mechanisms of adaptation: duplication and functional diversification of keratin genes  <cit> , expansion of genes encoding olfactory receptors to detect airborne ligands  <cit> , and positive selection on either nuclear genes involved in the urea cycle  <cit> , or mitochondrial genes responding to the increase of oxygen during the devonian  <cit> . however, the genomic basis of the transition to the land in panpulmonates is still unknown.

the animal mitochondrial genome encodes  <dig> proteins that are involved in the production of almost all energy in the eukaryotic cells. these proteins belong to four of the five complexes of the oxidative phosphorylation  pathway and are under high functional constraints  <cit> . for example, inefficiencies caused by amino acid changes in these proteins alter the oxphos performance, and produce reactive oxygen species , i.e., molecules that lead to cellular damage and metabolism disruption  <cit> . in addition, amino acid substitutions have been shown to improve aerobic capacity and adaptation to new environments  <cit> .

several studies have reported non-neutral changes in each of the  <dig> mitochondrial genes  <cit> . cytochrome c oxidase genes cox <dig> and cox <dig> from the freshwater fish poecilia spp. present substitutions involved in the adaptation to toxic  environments. these substitutions trigger conformational changes that block the uptake of h2s  <cit> . in addition, repeated selection at the same structural amino acid location has been found in the mitochondrial complex i from other fish, rodents and snakes  <cit> . the changes likely impacted the biomechanical apparatus that affect the electrochemical gradient in the mitochondria  <cit> . moreover, cytochrome b  in whales demonstrates several signatures of positive selection, in comparison to other artiodactyls. the adaptive changes in cob have been related to changes in the demand of metabolic processes during cetacean cladogenesis and the transition from land to water habitats  <cit> .

mitochondrial genomes of euthyneuran gastropods represent a promising dataset to screen for adaptive signatures related to water-to-land transitions. as mentioned above, this clade contains terrestrial and intertidal panpulmonates , and also freshwater taxa  as well as other marine clades . here, we sequenced and annotated three new panpulmonate mitogenomes from the terrestrial ellobid carychium tridentatum  and the stylommatophorans arion rufus  and helicella itala . we used these new mitogenomes in addition to  <dig> already published euthyneuran mitogenomes, to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of euthyneura. finally, we evaluate the magnitude of selective pressures that occurred on the branches leading to terrestrial taxa.

RESULTS
characteristics of the new panpulmonate mitogenomes
the length of the three new mitochondrial genomes from the terrestrial panpulmonates carychium tridentatum , arion rufus and helicella itala  are 13908 bp, 14321 bp, and 13966 bp, respectively. the three mitogenomes all encode for  <dig> protein-coding genes ,  <dig> trnas, and  <dig> rrnas, as reported for most other animal mitogenomes  <cit> . a detailed overview of the gene annotations can be found in table  <dig>  nine genes are encoded on the major strand: cox <dig>  cox <dig>  cob, nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad4l, nad <dig> and nad6; while four are encoded in the minor strand: atp <dig>  atp <dig>  cox <dig> and nad <dig>  the gene arrangement is similar to other panpulmonates  <cit> . basically, the coding-genes are organized as follows: cox1–nad6–nad5–nad1–nad4l–cob–cox2–atp8–atp6–nad3–nad4–cox3–nad <dig>  the cluster cox2-atp8-atp <dig> is conserved among other gastropods and cephalopods  <cit> . however, in a. rufus, we found the small rrna subunit between cox <dig> and atp <dig> . furthermore, clusters trnd-trnc-trnf and trny-trnw-trng-trnh-trnq-trnl <dig> are typical in ellobioidea and systellomatophora  <cit> . we found these clusters in the ellobiid c. tridentatum, but also in the stylommatophorans h. itala, and a. rufus, the latter with a slight modification .table  <dig> gene features in the three new panpulmonate mitogenomes

the total length of the pcg is 10923 bp in c. tridentatum, 10935 bp in a. rufus, and 11071 bp h. itala. the gc-content of the pcg is approximately 30 %, being slightly higher in h. itala . pcg start with five different initiation codons: ata, atg, att, gtg, ttg. finally, an at-rich intergenic spacer between cox <dig> and trni has been proposed as the potential origin of replication  in other euthyneurans  <cit> . we found the same intergenic region in each of the three new mitogenomes. the at-mean value in the potential por region was 83 %.

phylogenetic analyses
our reconstructed tree is congruent with previous comprehensive phylogenetic analyses in euthyneura, using a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear genes  <cit> , and phylogenomics  <cit>  . tectipleura   <cit>  are highly supported in both ml and bi analyses. the clade nudipleura is monophyletic and within this clade, pleurobranchidae  is the sister group of nudibranchia, as proposed by göbbeler et al.  <cit> . in addition, there is high support for the clade euopisthobranchia. this clade was defined by jörger et al.  <cit>  reuniting the clades umbraculoidea, anaspidea, runcinacea, pteropoda and cephalaspidea. in our topology, anaspidea  and the cephalaspideans bulla, odontoglaja, sagaminopteron and smaragdinella conform a monophyletic group.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of the euthyneura based on mitochondrial genomes. support for all branches is higher than 95/ <dig>   unless otherwise indicated. habitats are represented by colors following the scheme proposed by schrödl  <cit> : marine , intertidal , freshwater , and terrestrial . mixed colors indicate clades that occur in multiple habitats. terrestrial taxa  with new mitogenomic data are highlighted in bold letters. photo credits: natural museum rotterdam , stephen childs /cc by  <dig> , samuel chow /cc by  <dig> 



previous mitochondrial phylogenetic reconstructions recovered the monophyly of the former accepted clade “opisthobranchia” and the paraphyly of “pulmonata”  <cit> . however, the topologies derived from mitogenomics have received criticism, for long-branch attraction  artifacts affecting the topologies in heterobranchia. in these cases, long-branched stylommatophorans were recovered closer to the root of the clade while they appeared as derived in the nuclear topologies  <cit> . on the other hand, recent genomic evidence rejected “opisthobranchia” in favor of euopisthobranchia as the sister group of panpulmonata. phylogenetic reconstructions based on concatenated nuclear and mitochondrial genes  <cit>  as well new phylogenomic studies  <cit>  recovered the paraphyly of “opisthobranchia”, and support for panpulmonata.

we were aware of these rooting issues; thus, we choose members of the “lower heterobranchia” as outgroup taxa. our topology recovered monophyletic panpulmonata and euopisthobranchia as its sister group. the clade panpulmonata, defined by jörger et al.  <cit> , comprises the clades amphiboloidea, ellobioidea, glacidorboidea, hygrophila, siphonarioidea, stylommatophora, and systellomatophora plus acochlidia and sacoglossa, previously regarded as opisthobranchs  <cit> . therefore, panpulmonata possesses an extraordinary diversity in morphology , and habitats .

recently, the monophyly of “pulmonata” has been challenged  <cit> , i.e., evidence from phylogenomics did not recover “pulmonata” as a monophyletic group  <cit> . in our tree, members from amphibolidae  and pyramidelloidea  appear between traditional “pulmonata” clades, favoring panpulmonata over “pulmonata”. our topology supports the amphipulmonata clade   <cit> , and rejects the geophila hypothesis   <cit> . finally, the association between stylommatophora and hygrophila has been also found using phylogenomic analyses  <cit> , although with a small subset of euthyneuran taxa.

patterns of evolutionary rates
the relative evolutionary rates  for amino acids were not equally distributed over the alignment . the mean rer value in the nad genes was 2– <dig> times higher than in the cox genes. the rer for the cox <dig> gene were below the mean rates in our dataset, indicating a higher number of conserved sites.

stylommatophora  along with hygrophila  presented the highest divergence slopes in our data . this means that fewer nucleotide changes produced more amino acid changes in comparison to the other clades, i. e. non-synonymous changes are more frequent in both stylommatophora and hygrophila. furthermore, stylommatophora presented the highest absolute values for both nucleotide and amino acid divergence. this result explains the presence of long branches in this clade .

several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the extreme divergence found in the mitochondrial dna of land snails   <cit> :  exceptionally accelerated rate of evolution,  haplotype groups previously differentiated in isolated refuges getting into secondary contact,  natural  selection preserving the variation, and  the particular population structure in pulmonates that allowed them to preserve ancient haplotypes. accelerated evolution of the mtdna has been found in several species of land snails and slugs . the evolutionary rate in the mtdna  of the snails euhadra and mandarina was 10 % per ma  <cit> , and  <dig>  % in the slug arion  <cit> . however, this is not a general pattern for all pulmonates, for example the evolutionary rate of albinaria and partula was estimated to be 1– <dig>  and  <dig>  % per ma, respectively  <cit> . the secondary contact after allopatric divergence of haplotypes  has been found in candidula  <cit>  and cepaea  <cit> . moreover, introgression of mitochondrial lineages as a result of hybridization has been observed in two species of the land snail genus trochulus  <cit> . the effect of natural selection  shaping the genetic diversity has been proposed before for land snails  <cit>  although it was considered to be uncommon  <cit> . however, a recent study has shown that mitochondrial dna undergoes substantial amounts of adaptive evolution, especially in mollusks  <cit> . the particular demographic pattern of land snails that produces highly structured populations , i.e., “islands” of isolated demes, affects the probability of reciprocal monophyly of two samples and the chance that a gene tree matches the species tree  <cit> , and explained the persistence of ancestral polymorphisms and the extreme divergence in achatinella  <cit> , systrophia  <cit> , and xerocrassa  <cit> . in addition, in the case of hygrophila, some studies found high divergence rates in physella  <cit> , and radix  <cit> , although no clear hypothesis has been proposed to explain this pattern.

analyses of selective pressures
codon substitution models have been widely used to detect adaptive signatures affecting protein evolution  <cit> . first, we tested for the presence of positive selected codons across the alignments. all comparisons  consistently favored positive selection models m2a and m <dig> in cox <dig>  cox <dig>  cox <dig>  and cob  . however, the proportion of sites with ω >  <dig> was extremely low . high ω-values in the positively selected genes can be explained by the presence of few synonymous sites affecting dn estimations. on the contrary, a context of strong negative selection could explain ω <  <dig> for most of the genes  <cit> .table  <dig> site test of positive selection

positive selection tests based on either sites or branches only, are conservative for many genes  <cit> . this is because the test is only significant if the average ω >  <dig> holds true for all sites or all branches. however, one might expect that positive selection affects only specific sites in specific branches or lineages  <cit> . for these reasons, we used the branch-site test of positive selection  <cit>  focusing on the branches leading to terrestrial taxa  within panpulmonata. the alternative model  fitted significantly better than the null model  in the genes cox <dig>  cox <dig>  cob and nad <dig> . from these four genes, only cob and nad <dig> presented an ω-ratio higher than one and positively selected codons in the foreground  .table  <dig> branch-site test of positive selection on the mitochondrial genes

the branch-site model has been shown to detect ancient episodes of positive selection  <cit> . a potential problem of the test can be the saturation over long evolutionary times; however, simulations have shown that extreme sequence divergence does not generate false positives although it can lead to a high rate of false negatives, especially in older nodes  <cit> . in the same study, significant levels of positive selection  were detected at the radiation of bony vertebrates , approximately 400–500 ma  <cit> . in our data, divergence times are lower than in the vertebrate study: euthyneura and panpulmonata probably diverged from their sister groups 250–350 ma and 150–250 ma ago, respectively; while panpulmonate clades with terrestrial taxa diverged more recently   <cit> .

convergent adaptations related to realm shifts
the evolution of the lung in early panpulmonates, probably originating from the pallial cavity of an intertidal gilled-ancestor, was the key evolutionary innovation that allowed the diversification to non-marine realms  <cit> . both ellobioidea and stylommatophora possess lungs, although they colonized the land in different times. land invasions in ellobioidea occurred at least twice, one within the genus pythia  and the other in the subfamily carychiinae   <cit> ; while terrestrialization in stylommatophora appeared to be older   <cit> .

different genes appeared to be under positive selection  in terrestrial panpulmonate branches. while cob and nad <dig> are both part of the oxphos pathway, they belong to different complexes , suggesting that adaptations occurred in several molecular targets. the observed non-synonymous mutations produced similar changes in the amino acid properties, albeit in different regions of each gene. results from treesaap for both cob and nad <dig> showed that these changes alter the equilibrium constant  property . this property may influence the protein efficiency reducing ros production while increasing individual longevity  <cit> . alterations in the equilibrium constant may have allowed organisms to better cope with abiotic stress conditions in the new hot, cold or dry habitats. for example, desiccation tolerance has been shown as a limiting factor for the invasion of dry habitats in thiarid freshwater snails  <cit> . moreover, the activation of the antioxidant metabolism reducing ros excess has been linked to desiccation tolerance in the algae mastocarpus stellatus and porphyra columbina occurring in the upper intertidal zone  <cit> . since desiccation stress  is linked to metabolic activity and ros production  <cit> , this directly affects the invasion success of an evolutionary lineage.fig.  <dig> detection of significant physicochemical amino acids changes using treesaap. this analysis was performed on the genes that were shown to be under positive selection by paml. regions above the z-score of  <dig>  were significantly different than assumed under neutrality. only the highest significant category  is shown. this category represents a significant change in the equilibrium constant  property. a
cob, b
nad <dig>  asterisks indicate regions under positive selection according to paml and treesaap 



the increase in metabolic efficiency has been also related with the terrestrial invasion in other animals, e. g., tetrapods, during the devonian. amphibians, lungfishes, and coelacanths presented significant changes in the same equilibrium constant  property suggesting an adaptation to increased oxygen levels and changing metabolic requirements  <cit> . these mutations affected both cob and nad <dig> tetrapod genes. also, it is noteworthy to mention that in the terrestrial panpulmonate nad <dig> gene, the different approaches used by paml and treesaap found signatures of positive selection along with amino acid property changes in similar regions .

changes at the molecular level could have also occurred in different taxa, so we compared the sites under positive selection in our data against previous studies to find sites with similar adaptive patterns . for cob, site  <dig> is located in an intermembrane domain. this site is homologous to site  <dig> in a previous cetacean-artiodactyl alignment  and was revealed to be under selective pressure in cetaceans, also influencing the equilibrium constant of the cd <dig> intermembrane helix  <cit> . the authors proposed that non-synonymous changes in cob are related to increasing metabolic demands during cladogenesis. similarly, adaptive evolution in cob has been related to the increase of energy metabolism in response to the evolution of flight in bats  <cit> .table  <dig> alignment section of the cob gene from garvin et al.  <cit>

in case of nad <dig>  site  <dig> is homologous to site  <dig> from the alignment of garvin et al.  <cit>  . this site is positively selected in rorquals  and salmons . site  <dig> is part of the biomechanical apparatus that generates the electrochemical gradient and it has been shown to be under positive selection in the pacific salmon species  <cit>  and in eutherians  <cit> . also, site  <dig> corresponds to site  <dig> in subterranean rodents  <cit> . this codon position is positively selected only in lineages that independently colonized the subterranean niche, a habitat suggested to be energetically demanding  <cit> . mutations in the nadh complex, especially in the transmembrane domains, may affect the proton pump activity of this complex  <cit> . these changes could facilitate the proton flow and improve the efficiency of atp production - characteristics associated to increased energetic requirements in non-marine habitats  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we represent evidence of positive selection on several amino acid positions in the mitochondrial complexes i  and iii . these episodes of positive selection occurred in independent branches of panpulmonates with terrestrial taxa , indicating their possible role during the invasion of the land realm. most of these sites have been shown to be also under positive selection in several other taxa. moreover, the general pattern suggests that non-synonymous mutations in both genes are probably linked to increased or altered metabolic requirements. an increased demand for energy due to the colonization of land and the necessity to cope with different abiotic stress conditions may have changed the physiological constraints in the early terrestrial panpulmonates and triggered functional adaptations at the mitochondrial level. future studies can take into account the predicted codons and the information on the physicochemical changes to test whether these mutations also affect protein structure and function. new genomic information from panpulmonates will most likely reveal even more genes involved in metabolic and structural processes that were key to the colonization of the terrestrial realm.
