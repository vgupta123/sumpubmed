BACKGROUND
metamorphosis, the complete transformation from larva to pupa and then to adult, is a significant process for holometabolous insects such as moths and flies. during metamorphosis larval tissues like midgut, fat body and integument are histolyzed via a programmed cell death process and remodeled to adult structures  <cit> . insect metamorphosis is known to be controlled by the interplay of two hormones, juvenile hormone  and 20-hydroxyecdysone . at the end of the final larval stage, the jh titer decreases and 20e initiates metamorphosis in the absence of jh  <cit> . recently, a set of transcriptional regulators involved in the ecdysone-regulated metamorphosis cascade has been revealed. for example, broad gene  plays a key role in the initiation and progression through metamorphosis, but not in larval molt  <cit> . during this process, the phosphorylation state of these proteins is also closely related to their function. for instance, phosphorylation mediated by protein kinase c  can suppress jh action by preventing nuclear proteins from binding to jh-responsive promoters  <cit> . moreover, pkc-mediated phosphorylation of ultraspiracle protein  is essential for 20e-induced gene expression in the salivary glands of drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanism of hormonal regulation of metamorphosis is still a mystery. therefore, it is important to identify specifically expressed proteins and their phosphorylation states in order to understand the biochemistry of metamorphosis.

two-dimensional gel electrophoresis  in conjunction with mass spectrometry provides a useful tool for detection of differentially expressed proteins. zhang and his colleagues identified twelve proteins from the skeletal muscles of the silkworm, bombyx mori  <cit>  with significantly different expression levels in larvae and pupae. in the salivary gland of drosophila, 20e-induced expression of fourteen proteins required pkc activity  <cit> . recently, the pro-q diamond phosphoprotein stain  was found to be a powerful tool for revealing differentially regulated phosphoproteins and has been widely used to detect phosphoproteins after separation on 2-de gels  <cit> . thus, 2de-based proteomic and phosphoproteomic approaches were applied to understand the molecular mechanisms of larval metamorphosis.

the cotton bollworm,helicoverpa armigera, is an important agricultural pest worldwide. it is also an ideal model for studying the molting and metamorphosis of lepidopteran insects because of its relatively large body size, fast development, and easy cultivation in the laboratory. pauchet et al. reported the midgut lumen proteome of h. armigera feeding larvae and identified not only digestive enzymes but also arginine kinase and pathogen recognition proteins  <cit> . to identify the molting- and metamorphosis-related proteins and genes, we have reported a set of genes that are differentially expressed during molting and metamorphosis  <cit> . thirty differentially expressed proteins, including enzymes, regulators, protein hydrolases and receptors, have been detected in the epidermis, fat body and hemolymph of h. armigera during larval molting  <cit> . the purpose of this study is to further identify the differentially expressed and phosphorylated proteins in the epidermis of h. armigera during larval-pupal metamorphosis.

RESULTS
mapping differentially expressed and phosphorylated proteins
because the larva-pupa transition takes approximately  <dig> days, in order to identify as many metamorphically expressed proteins as possible, we combined the samples of metamorphosis  epidermis from five time points during metamorphosis . the 5th feeding larvae  were selected as controls to compare the protein profiles between the metamorphosis and feeding samples. instead of normalization of gels, the spots were compared by ratio . figure  <dig> showed the differentially expressed and phosphorylated proteins during metamorphosis.

the protein spots that were up-regulated on protein levels and/or had variation of phosphorylation in the 6th-m epidermis sample when compared with that of the 5th-f were selected for further identification by pmf  and ms/ms spectra . these spots can be divided into three groups. the proteins in the first group had increased expression but were not phosphorylated because no signal was detected in the pro-q stained gels, including spots 1- <dig> . in the second group, the increased expression of the proteins was accompanied by induced phosphorylation, including spots, 35- <dig> . in the third group, the expression of the proteins was maintained at the same level, but their phosphorylation state changed, including spots 58- <dig>  with a lower phosphorylation signal for spots  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  but a higher signal for spot  <dig> in the 6th-m gel .

identification of proteins by pmf and ms/ms spectra
in order to maximize protein identification, the ncbi nr_metazoa database was selected. protein scores greater than  <dig> were considered statistically significant  when using pmf spectra. in this way, sixteen spots were identified. when using ms/ms spectra, protein scores greater than  <dig> were statistically significant; five proteins were confirmed using this approach. in addition,  <dig> spots that were not identified by pmf data were identified using ms/ms spectra data. because of the lack of information on h. armigera proteins, among the sixty-one spots analyzed by mass spectrometry only eighteen spots were identified by mascot searches. most of the proteins were identified according to protein sequences from other insects such as d. melanogaster and b. mori. hexamerin  was the only one identified through h. armigera . the other spots gave pmf and ms/ms spectra but mascot searches did not produce significant match results.

symbols in the table: *, pmf score >  <dig> significant, ms/ms score >  <dig> significant; a, protein variation; p, phosphorylation variation; -, not known; ↑, increase compared to 5th-f; ↓ decrease compared to 5th-f; no, no change.

most of the experimental mws and pis of the identified proteins are consistent with their theoretical values, but the mws and pis of a few proteins including spots  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the gel varied, presumably due to post-translational modification. phosphorylation may increase the experimental mw and shift the protein to a more acidic pi, as for heat shock protein   and solute carrier family  <dig> . moreover, the mw difference between protein homologues should also be taken into consideration since the majority of proteins were identified based on protein sequence information from other species. for example, the theoretical mw of aldehyde dehydrogenase from bombyx mori is  <dig> kda which is different from the approximately  <dig> kda experimental mw of aldehyde dehydrogenase in h. armigera. nevertheless, further verification is needed for this protein.

in the identified proteins, hexamerin  and hsp <dig>  appeared more than once. the spots of hexamerin were very close to each other in the gels, so they might result from different isoforms or other post-translational modifications. however, the mws of the two hsp1s  were different so it is possible that they are different hsps.

analysis of identified proteins on the gene transcription level
according to a previous study on the developmental stages of h. armigera  <cit> , helicoverpa larval metamorphosis begins about  <dig> h after larvae enter their last instar. therefore, total rna for rt-pcr analysis was extracted from the feeding 5th instar larvae , the feeding 6th instar larvae  and metamorphically committed larvae .

eight genes encoding the identified proteins described above in table  <dig> were analyzed. the results showed that hexamerin, calponin,  <dig> s acidic ribosomal protein p <dig>  arylphorin subunit and aldehyde dehydrogenase appeared increased transcriptional expression during metamorphosis, which were consistent with the result of 2-de .

the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4a  showed an increase in transcription at the 6th- <dig> and 6th- <dig> h feeding stages but no significant variation after metamorphic commitment when larvae entered 6th- <dig> h. similarly, the atp synthase beta subunit did not show a significant increase during metamorphosis . these were consistent with the results of 2-de, where they had the same expression levels between 5th- <dig> h and metamorphosis but with decreased phosphorylation levels during metamorphosis . these two proteins might participate in metamorphosis by a regulated decrease in their phosphorylation levels but not in mrna transcription levels.

the proteasome alpha  <dig> subunit transcription levels showed a typical increase in mrna levels during metamorphosis, which was not correlated to the 2-de result of constant protein level . the reason for this lack of correlation might be post-transcriptional regulation or increased protein turnover.

analysis of identified proteins on the translation level
western blotting was used to confirm expression levels of differentially expressed proteins identified by the proteomic approach. because the antibodies against h. armigera proteins were not commercially available, only two identified proteins, calponin  and hexamerin  were adopted for analysis in the epidermis of the 5th-f, 6th-f and 6th-m larvae. consistent with the 2-de results, calponin and hexamerin both showed an increase at 6th- <dig> h, 6th- <dig> h and 6th- <dig> h during metamorphosis . these results suggested that both genes were up-regulated by 20e in vivo during metamorphosis.

to test this hypothesis, the 6th instar feeding larvae were injected with 20e and protein samples were extracted. western blot analysis showed that both calponin and hexamerin underwent a remarkable enhancement in their expression levels after 20e injection compared to the dmso control. these results indicate that 20e up-regulated the expression of calponin and hexamerin during metamorphosis of the cotton bollworm .

as shown in fig. 4b, calponin exhibited two bands with slightly different molecular sizes when stimulated by 20e. since helicoverpa calponin does not have signal peptides and is unlikely to be exposed to the n-glycosylation machinery for glycosylation http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/netnglyc/, the upper band is most likely the phosphorylated form of calponin. to test this hypothesis, the protein sample was treated with λ phosphatase. λ phosphatase treatment decreased the upper band signal and enhanced the lower band signal, confirming that the upper band is a phosphorylated form of calponin . protein kinase consensus recognition sequence analysis revealed that calponin contains a protein kinase c  phosphorylation site at amino acid residue thr <dig> with score  <dig>  http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/netphosk/. this prompted us to test whether pkc is involved in the phosphorylation of calponin. when the pkc specific inhibitor  was injected into the larvae together with 20e, the upper band disappeared  and the lower band immunoreactivity doubled, indicating that pkc is responsible for calponin phosphorylation.

investigating the pertinence of calponin to metamorphosis
to examine the pertinence of calponin to metamorphosis, we examined the expression profiles of calponin and broad , an initiating factor of metamorphosis. results showed that the mrna of calponin in the epidermis increased when larvae entered metamorphosis from 6th- <dig> h to pupae, which was correlated to the expression profile of br. in addition, both calponin and br were able to be induced after 20e was injected into the 6th-6h larva for  <dig> hours .

discussion
calponin is an actin-binding protein that inhibits actomyosin atpase activity  <cit> . in human muscle, calponin can directly activate pkc autophosphorylation that increases pkc activity  <cit> . since pkc is required for 20e-induced gene expression and can block jh action  <cit> , we hypothesized that up-regulation of calponin during the larval-pupal metamorphosis may facilitate 20e action by activating pkc. interestingly, calponin can also be phosphorylated by pkc  <cit> , but its phosphorylation signal in the present study was weak in 2-de gels during the larval-pupal metamorphosis. the low phosphorylation signal might be due to a single putative pkc phosphorylation site as revealed by the protein kinase consensus recognition sequence analysis described above. nevertheless, we detected the phosphorylation of calponin by western blot and demonstrated that 20e increases calponin phosphorylation via pkc.

the mrna of calponin and br in epidermis of h. armigera exhibited similar expression profiles. they both vastly accumulated during metamorphosis. both calponin and br can be induced by 20e when 6th feeding larvae were injected with 20e for different time periods. this induction seemed to be distinguishing. induction of br mrna by 20e was earlier than that of calponin. these validated the story that br initiates metamorphosis. furthermore, calponin is demonstrated to be possibly involved in larval-pupal metamorphosis of h. armigera.

helicoverpa calponin shares 70% identity with apis chd <dig> and 67% identity with drosophila chd <dig>  li et al.  <cit>  presented a model of the signal transduction pathway for the jh-regulated genes, in which chd <dig> is a chaperone protein that regulates gene expression in the 20e and jh signal transduction pathway. they indicated that in the presence of high jh and 20e levels  the mrnas of fkbp <dig>  and chd <dig>  are induced, interact with ecr , usp and met, and bind to the dmjhre <dig>  sequence. this could result in the increase in the expression of dmjhre1-containing genes and reduction in the expression of ecdysone response genes due to a decrease in the availability of ecr and usp. when 20e increases in the absence of jh , the fkbp <dig> and chd <dig> levels are low. under this circumstance, ecr heterodimerizes with other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, especially with usp, thus inducing the expression of ecdysone response genes. however, our results show that calponin was up regulated during metamorphosis and 20e increased the expression of calponin. this discrepancy may be due to the differences among species or the differences among proteins. because chd <dig> has been shown to interact with  <dig> proteins http://www.thebiogrid.org/searchresults/summary/ <dig>  the exact function of calponin in metamorphosis needs further study.

hexamerins usually consist of six approximately  <dig> kda subunits, giving rise to a native molecule of about  <dig> kda  <cit> . hexamerins containing a high concentration of aromatic amino acids are called arylphorins  <cit> . they are synthesized and reach extraordinary concentrations just before metamorphosis  <cit> . although hexamerins are thought to act mainly as storage proteins, they have also been identified as constituents of the sclerotizing system  <cit> , which plays a key role in pupal cuticle formation. phylogenetic analysis revealed that insect prophenoloxidases were also members of hexamerin family, and played a role in sclerotization of the cuticle and encapsulation of foreign particles  <cit> . zhou also hypothesized that hexamerins limited the impacts of jh on termite caste polyphenism by modulating jh availability  <cit> . by subtractive hybridization, dong et al. pointed out that hexamerin was also up-regulated at the transcriptional level in the epidermis of h. armigera during metamorphosis  <cit> .

a viral-like chitinase was also found to be up-regulated. the degradation of cuticular chitin by chitinases is a vital step prior to ecdysis and metamorphosis  <cit> . kramer et al.  <cit>  reported that the chitinase gene of manduca sexta was most highly expressed in epidermal and gut tissues during the larval-pupal metamorphosis and its transcription was stimulated by 20e and inhibited by a jh mimic. the chitinase might be involved in remodeling of the integument during metamorphosis.

proteasome alpha  <dig> subunit is a member of the 20s proteasome, which is atp-independent and has several distinct catalytic activities involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system  <cit> . phosphorylation can control the import of proteasomes into the nucleus  <cit> . the proteasome subunit alpha type  <dig> was found up-regulated in fat bodies of h. armigera during larval molting  <cit> . the up-regulation of proteasome alpha  <dig> subunit suggested the participation of proteasomes in tissue remodeling during larval molting and metamorphosis.

some of the differentially expressed proteins identified in the metamorphic larval epidermis in the present study, such as atp synthase, proteasome subunit and translation initiation factor 4a, are similar to those found in the molting larval epidermis in our previous study  <cit> . interestingly, atp synthase beta subunit and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4a, which were induced by 20e and inhibited by the pkc specific inhibitor chelerythrine chloride  in drosophila salivary glands  <cit> , are also phosphoproteins in the metamorphosis epidermis in our study, suggesting that they might play important roles in the 20e signal transduction pathway during metamorphosis.

CONCLUSIONS
the results suggest that the up-regulation and/or changes in the phosphorylation levels of proteins are involved in the larval-pupal metamorphosis. hexamerin was highly expressed in the epidermis during metamorphosis. in addition, calponin was highly expressed in the metamorphic epidermis and phosphorylated by protein kinase c, which suggesting it plays an important role in metamorphosis.
