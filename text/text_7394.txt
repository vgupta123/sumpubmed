BACKGROUND
protein-protein interactions are fundamental to biological processes and their analysis is essential for the understanding of cellular pathways. given the complexity and the dynamic range of the proteome, estimated at  <dig> proteins, the elucidation of protein interactions requires the development of comprehensive, high-throughput proteomic methods that allow quantification of multiple proteins simultaneously  <cit> . the development of protein microarrays represents an attractive new high-throughput technology platform. it involves the printing of ordered arrays of biomolecules onto a solid surface in miniaturized format that allows for the simultaneous determination of multiple interactions using small amounts of samples within a single experiment. the basic principles for highly sensitive "microspot" ligand-binding assays were described by ekins  <cit>  who proposed the "ambient analyte theory" and showed that microspots containing small amounts of capture molecules were able to detect low analyte concentrations with very high accuracy and sensitivity. since then, miniaturized protein arrays are emerging as one of the most powerful proteomics tools but their application is far more complex  <cit>  than the dna microarrays  due to structural complexity and heterogeneity of proteins, including their post-translational modifications. binding of the proteins onto the solid surface of an array must maintain tertiary structure sufficient for functions such as receptor-ligand binding or antibody reactivity. chemically derivatized microarray surfaces  <cit>  or the use of mab  <cit>  have been shown to maintain protein functionality, thus increasing the potential for successful application of microarray technology in proteomics.

the study of leukocyte membrane protein interactions provides a particular need because of the large number of interactions yet to be defined  <cit>  and a technical challenge as these interactions are often of very low affinity with kd in the range 1– <dig> μm  <cit> . although weak, these interactions are important in the context of leukocytes interacting with other cells as illustrated by all the functional data on the interaction of cd <dig> with mhc class ii   <cit> . the proteins involved usually contain folded domains, the most common type belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily   <cit> . such domains often interact through large faces of the proteins and require proper folding  <cit> . when measuring low affinity interactions, misleading results can be obtained from unfolded or aggregated materials which are not really a problem when dealing with high affinity interactions such as with cytokines and their receptors, or between proteins and linear epitopes such as lectins and carbohydrates. in addition many leukocyte surface proteins are heavily glycosylated and the oligosaccharides, even if not directly involved in binding, may be important in maintaining biologically active proteins  <cit> . thus, in applying the protein microarray technology to the study of leukocyte surface protein interactions, it is imperative that the proteins are expressed in eukaryotic systems to ensure correct disulphide bond formation and post-translational modifications.

in this study we chose a well characterized interaction between cd <dig>  and its receptor cd200r  as a model system to devise a high throughput protein array method for characterization of the interactions between leukocyte surface proteins. cd <dig> is a widely distributed membrane protein with two extracellular igsf domains and a short cytoplasmic region unlikely to signal. it interacts with a receptor  expressed mostly on myeloid cells, which also has two extracellular igsf domains but a longer cytoplasmic region with several tyrosine residues that can be phosphorylated  <cit> . functional analysis suggests that the leukocyte cd <dig> protein can mediate a down-regulatory signal to myeloid cells through the inhibitory cd200r. thus the cd <dig> null mice have an increased susceptibility to autoimmune disease induction and myeloid cells expressing cd200r are more activated  <cit> . cd <dig> and a viral homologue found in kaposi sarcoma virus, when expressed at the cell surface, gave inhibition of production of inflammatory cytokines from activated macrophages  <cit> ; and targeting the cd200-cd200r interaction with agonistic mab or cd200-fc fusion proteins in vivo ameliorates autoimmunity in disease models  <cit> .

protein arrays can be divided into two major classes: 'forward phase' if the analytes are captured from solution; or 'reverse phase' if the analytes are bound directly to the solid phase  <cit> . in forward phase protein microarrays, a bait molecule such as an antibody is immobilized onto a solid support to capture the analytes which can be proteins in purified form, or in complex solutions such as cell lysates  <cit>  or tissue samples  <cit> . the bound analytes are detected either by direct labelling or via a secondary antibody. in reverse phase arrays, the analytes  are directly immobilized on the solid phase and antibodies or interacting proteins are applied in solution phase. the analytes can be labelled directly or detected using tags and signal amplification.

we have used the forward phase approach in the mapping of antigenic epitopes of hcd200r where different antibodies were immobilized on epoxy coated glass slides, incubated with the hcd200r analyte and detected with fluorescently labelled anti-cd200r antibodies. we have applied reverse phase arrays to three different purposes: -to test the reactivity of the fluorescently labelled mab with directly immobilized hcd200r protein, -to map epitopes located near the ligand binding site using arrayed mutant hcd200r recombinant proteins and detection with fluorescently labelled mab that block ligand-receptor interactions and -to detect the low affinity binding of immobilized cd200r to the multivalent cd <dig> ligand presented on fluorescently labelled beads. our study extends the use of protein microarrays to the detection of transient cell surface protein interactions, which are of lower affinity than the reported cytokine arrays  <cit> .

RESULTS
quantitative binding of dx <dig>  dx <dig> and ox <dig> mab to human cd200r
purified, soluble recombinant hcd200r protein, engineered with domains  <dig> and  <dig> of rat cd <dig> as an antigenic tag   <cit>  was directly immobilized at different concentrations on epoxy-coated glass slides, in a reverse phase array as illustrated schematically . the hcd200r array was tested for reactivity with three different mab: dx <dig>  and two previously reported  <cit>  mab dx <dig> and ox <dig> able to block ligand binding. controls on the arrays included recombinant mouse cd200r-cd4d3+ <dig> protein   <cit>  and rat cd4d3+ <dig>  figure 1b and 1c illustrate the strong and specific binding of all three fluorescently labelled mab to hcd200r, as demonstrated by minimal reactivity with rcd <dig>  and lack of cross-reaction with mcd200r. dx <dig> gave the strongest labelling with linear binding from  <dig>  to  <dig> μg ml- <dig> mab, reaching the upper limits of detection under the optimized voltage settings  at  <dig> μg/ml . binding of dx <dig> was linear over the full range of concentrations with a maximum binding of  <dig>  units. ox <dig> bound more weakly, reaching a maximum value of  <dig>  units. sensitivity of detection, defined as two-fold binding above background, was estimated as the lowest hcd200r-cd4d3+ <dig> concentration tested  for dx <dig>  a three-fold signal to noise ratio was achieved for dx <dig> at that concentration suggesting that sensitivity of detection was closer to  <dig>  μg ml- <dig>  for ox <dig>  the limit of sensitivity was estimated at  <dig>  μg ml- <dig>  thus dx <dig>  dx <dig> and ox <dig> were able to detect  <dig>  pg,  <dig>  pg and  <dig>  pg of hcd200r per spot respectively estimating a spot volume of  <dig> nl. the limit of sensitivity achieved was therefore between  <dig> and  <dig> attomol, assuming a molecular weight of  <dig>  for hcd200r-cd4d3+ <dig> protein. the amounts of human and mouse cd200r-cd4d3+ <dig> and rcd4d3+ <dig> protein on the microarray spots were similar as visualized by the red fluorescence of ox <dig> mab recognising the cd <dig> tag present in each of the recombinant proteins . this indicates that the amount of protein detected is proportional to the amount arrayed in each spot and is highly reproducible. the limit of sensitivity of protein detection with alexa 647-ox <dig> was approximately  <dig>  μg ml- <dig>  corresponding to  <dig> attomol of cd200r-cd4d3+ <dig> proteins. although not all molecules will be in a proper orientation for equal access to both anti-cd200r and anti-cd <dig>  as illustrated in fig. 1a, our results suggest that on average, there is a good correlation between the amount of specific antibody bound and the amount of protein arrayed.

orientation via antibody immobilization for epitope mapping on human cd200r
we used forward phase protein microarrays to define the epitopes of hcd200r recognized by the three mab introduced in the previous section. serial dilutions of dx <dig>  dx <dig> and ox <dig> mab and the control cd <dig> mab ox <dig> were directly immobilized on epoxy-coated glass slides as shown . the mab arrayed act as capture reagents for hcd200r, used at a concentration of  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  each capture mab binds to a different epitope on the hcd200r-rcd4d3+ <dig> recombinant protein, thus orientating the protein on the array in a conformation that permits or restricts access to the same panel of mab, used as detection reagents . visual observation  and quantitative analysis  showed that dx <dig> reacts with an epitope spatially distinct from the more closely related dx <dig> and ox <dig> epitopes. as expected, ox <dig> is the most suitable capture mab, as it binds the common cd <dig> tag allowing exposure of the two extracellular domains of hcd200r and binding of all three specific mab. when the detection mab is the same as the capture mab, no significant binding above background is observed . dx <dig> binds specifically to hcd200r-cd4d3+ <dig> orientated via ox <dig> and dx <dig> , but not via ox <dig> or via itself. this is an indication that the binding epitopes for dx <dig> and dx <dig> are dissimilar. dx <dig> in turn, binds well to hcd200r-cd4d3+ <dig> immobilized on ox <dig>  and to a lesser degree to hcd200r-cd4d3+ <dig> immobilized on dx <dig> , while not at all to hcd200r captured by ox <dig> . these data indicate that the dx <dig> epitope is spatially distinct from the dx <dig> epitope, but in close proximity to the ox <dig> epitope. this conclusion is substantiated by the lack of binding of ox <dig> mab to hcd200r-cd4d3+ <dig> captured on dx <dig>  orientating hcd200r via mab ox <dig> allows for specific binding of all three anti-human cd200r mab, in a linear fashion with limits of sensitivity of about  <dig> μg ml- <dig> of immobilized mab. the maximum amount of signal was obtained by capturing hcd200r with  <dig> μg ml- <dig> of mab ox <dig> and was equivalent to that observed by directly immobilizing approximately  <dig> μg ml- <dig> hcd200r. ox <dig> is therefore the best mab for capturing the chimaeric hcd200r-cd <dig> protein for optimal detection of hcd200r epitopes.

mapping of cd200r antigenic epitopes using mutants
both cd200r and its ligand, cd <dig> contain two extracellular igsf domains. the ligand-receptor interaction is therefore likely to occur in an end-to-end topology, requiring opposing cell surfaces to come into close proximity  <cit> . previous studies have shown that the membrane distal n-terminal domain of cd <dig> is involved in binding its receptor  <cit> . in a recently published study  <cit> , site directed mutagenesis was employed to map the ligand-binding domain of human cd200r using the structure of a typical ig v domain, that of the human junctional adhesion molecule  <dig>  jam <dig> to predict the positions of out-pointing residues  <cit> . a panel of mutants was designed so as to target residues likely to be out-pointing from predictions of the beta strands of the n-terminal igsf domain of hcd200r. the binding sites of cd <dig> and of the ox <dig> mab known to block ligand interaction to the hcd200r mutants, were shown to be on the gfcc' face of the n-terminal igsf domain  <cit> .

the same panel of hcd200r-cd4d3+ <dig> mutant proteins  was analyzed by reverse protein microarrays  for binding to mab dx <dig>  dx <dig> and ox <dig> in order to map these epitopes. the mutant proteins were expressed by transient transfection in serum-free medium, concentrated and arrayed. purified human and murine cd200r serving as positive and negative controls were immobilized at concentrations ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  lack of binding by a specific mutant or group of mutants is suggestive of the corresponding residues defining the location of the antigenic epitopes. none of the hcd200r mutants tested had lost binding to dx <dig>  confirming unpublished data that this epitope lies, not in the n-terminal domain of cd200r but in the membrane proximal domain. some of the mutants showed increased binding of mab over the wild type despite these being normalized with ox <dig> . this presumably reflects variations in epitope availability due to direct immobilization of the mutant proteins on the array, which are less likely to occur in biacore studies where mutants were immobilized via ox <dig> mab  <cit> . thus our data analysis was focused on mutants with major impairment in binding activity. nine of the mutants showed reduced binding to either dx <dig> and/or ox <dig> mab, relative to wild type hcd200r, as represented graphically in figure  <dig>  one mutant illustrated  did not affect binding in a significant manner. the position of these mutants is shown on the model of the n-terminal domain of hcd200r, based on a typical igsf domain of similar size . panel a shows the mutants affecting cd <dig> binding, as reported in  <cit> . these mutants were mostly in the gfcc' face and in particular the f and c strands. panel b shows the mutants with reduced binding to dx <dig> and/or ox <dig>  it is immediately noticeable that mutants within the f and c strands also appear to have lost binding to dx <dig> and ox <dig> mab, suggesting close proximity of these epitopes to the cd <dig> binding site, in agreement with the ligand blocking activity of these mab. however, the key residues were not identical as shown by the differing effects of the mutants i71k and r67d. furthermore, the microarray study confirms the results obtained by individual analysis of each mutant by surface plasmon resonance in terms of residues involved in ox <dig> binding; the most critical amino acid appears to be r <dig> located in the b-c loop  <cit> . the finding of mutants that had apparently gained cd200r mab binding activity compared to the ox <dig> mab recognising the cd <dig> tag, shows that spotting can have effects not seen by indirect methods such as the biacore. however there was very good correlation between available biacore data and microarray data. thus this method provides a rapid high throughput method to identify the rare mutants that affect antigenic activity that can then be characterised further e.g. by biacore analysis.

* mutants expressed with concentration below sensitivity threshold, for which no antibody binding data could be derived.

reactivity of human, rat and mouse cd200r with multimeric human cd200
the interaction of human cd <dig> with its receptor hcd200r is of low affinity, with a kd of ~ <dig>  μm at 37°c and t1/ <dig> of  <dig> s  <cit> , typical of the interaction of many leukocyte membrane proteins  <cit> . such an interaction could not be detected when immobilized hcd200r was incubated with fluorescently labelled purified monomeric hcd <dig> protein . in order to develop leukocyte membrane receptor-ligand microarray assays, high avidity detection reagents are required. recombinant hcd <dig> protein was constructed by linking the extracellular domains of human cd <dig> with domains  <dig> and  <dig> of rat cd <dig>  as an antigenic tag. this construct contains a  <dig> amino acid sequence at the c-terminus of the protein, which can be enzymatically biotinylated on a specific lysine residue using the e. coli bira enzyme  <cit> . expression of the construct was demonstrated by inhibition of a rat cd <dig> elisa using ox <dig> mab. the recombinant protein bound the mab ox <dig> , indicating that it was antigenically active, as assessed by biacore analysis  and its biotinylation was confirmed by streptavidin binding. the biotinylated hcd200-cd4d3+ <dig> protein or the control cd4d3+ <dig> protein were attached to avidin-coated fitc-fluorescent beads via their biotin tag, thus creating polyvalent cd <dig> and control reagents. these beads were used to detect specific binding of cd <dig> to human, mouse and rat cd200r proteins arrayed directly on epoxy-coated glass slides . additional controls included rcd4d3+ <dig> protein arrayed on the slide and tested for reactivity with both types of beads. strong binding of hcd200-beads to all three cd200r proteins was observed  indicating that the proteins immobilized on the glass surface had retained their capacity to bind ligand with maximum mean values of  <dig>  green fluorescence units for rat cd200r ,  <dig>  for mouse cd200r and  <dig>  for human cd200r. the fluorescence appears granular as one is actually visualizing the small fluorescent beads. binding was detected at concentrations of receptors ranging from approximately  <dig> to  <dig> μg ml- <dig> corresponding to 1– <dig> femtomol per spot on the microarray. the non-specific binding of hcd200-beads to immobilized rcd <dig> protein was negligible  and control cd4d3+ <dig> beads did not react with any of the arrayed proteins . the multivalent hcd200-beads cross-reacted with rat and mouse cd200r as expected, as biacore analysis has shown that hcd <dig> interacts with human, rat and mouse cd200r with affinity constants within a log of each other  <cit> . sensitivity of detection, defined as two-fold binding above background was achieved with concentrations of  <dig> μg ml- <dig> for rat cd200r and  <dig> μg ml- <dig> for human and murine cd200r. this corresponds to 1– <dig> femtomol of immobilized receptors interacting with the multimeric human cd <dig> ligand.

CONCLUSIONS
in order to study interactions of leukocyte membrane proteins using high throughput microarray techniques, it was essential that the proteins be immobilized at low concentrations and in a biologically active form. it is critical that weak interactions between leukocyte membrane proteins be detected without interference by the anomalous binding due to denatured proteins, which is more of a contributing factor in the study of low affinity interactions. we first established that recombinant cd200r proteins could be immobilized directly in reverse phase arrays, in a conformation capable of reacting with three different mab. we then demonstrated that recombinant mutant hcd200r proteins produced in transient expression systems were present in sufficient amounts to be immobilized directly and tested for reactivity with specific mab, permitting mapping of epitopes. these data show that high throughput analysis of cell surface proteins can be achieved in reverse phase arrays using recombinant proteins derived from transient transfectants in a non-purified form. we also used forward phase arrays for competitive analysis of antibodies and mapping of their epitopes. this approach is valuable for rapidly screening antibody specificities and assessing protein orientation needed for optimal presentation of immunogenic determinants.

we also showed that binding of cd <dig> ligand to its cell surface receptor can be achieved by increasing the avidity of the reaction via coupling of the biotinylated recombinant cd <dig> protein to fluorescently labelled avidin coated beads. the fluorescent beads offer an efficient technology for the analysis of low affinity interactions typical of those observed for leukocyte membrane proteins and many other cellular proteins.
