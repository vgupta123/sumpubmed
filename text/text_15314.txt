BACKGROUND
the genus cronobacter is composed of gram-negative, facultative anaerobic rods, which are members of the enterobacteriaceae family. it was formerly known as enterobacter sakazakii and was divided into  <dig> biotypes  <cit> . the biotyping scheme was based on voges-proskauer, methyl red, indole, ornithine decarboxylase, motility, reduction of nitrate to nitrite, production of gas from d-glucose, malonate utilization and production of acid from myo-inositol and dulcitol. based on 16s rdna sequence analysis, we extended this further to  <dig> biotypes  <cit>  which has contributed to the recent taxonomic revisions. initially the cronobacter genus was composed of  <dig> species; c. sakazakii, c. turicensis, c. muytjensii, c. dublinensis, plus a possible fifth species  <cit> . more recently, the species c. malonaticus sp. nov. was proposed  <cit> . this was initially regarded as a subspecies of c. sakazakii as the two species could not be distinguished according to 16s rdna sequence analysis however dna-dna hybridisation studies revealed a <70% dna relatedness. consequently c. sakazakii consists of biotypes 1- <dig>   <dig> &  <dig>   <dig> &  <dig>  and c. malonaticus contains biotypes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> .

cronobacter spp. have come to prominence due to their association with infant infections, and cases linked to the ingestion of contaminated reconstituted infant formula  <cit> . however not all cases have been linked to formula ingestion. the organism is ubiquitous in the environment  and food  <cit> .

cronobacter spp. cause infections across all age groups  <cit> . however neonates, particularly those of low-birth weight, are the major identified group at risk with a high mortality rate  <cit> . the organism is a rare cause of neonatal meningitis, necrotising enterocolitis  and sepsis. a number of outbreaks of c. sakazakii have been reported in neonatal intensive care units around the world  <cit> . the international commission for microbiological specifications for foods   <cit>  has ranked cronobacter spp. as 'severe hazard for restricted populations, life-threatening or substantial chronic sequelae or long duration'. the fao/who  <cit>  have undertaken three risk assessments of the organism in powdered infant formula, and the who  <cit>  have published recommended procedures for the reconstitution of powdered infant formula to reduce the risk of infection to neonates. together with the ubiquitous nature of the organism, and the high severity of infection for the immunocompromised, there is a need for a technique that enables fast and reliable classification and identification of cronobacter strains worldwide.

selected strains of cronobacter spp. have been shown to invade human intestinal cells, replicate in macrophages, and invade the blood brain barrier  <cit> . based on the clinical outcome of different pulsetypes during a neonatal intensive care unit outbreak it was proposed that certain types of c. sakazakii are particularly virulent  <cit> . whether the virulence was linked to a particular genotype or phenotype warranted further investigation.

16s rdna sequences can be useful to determine phylogenies between distantly related enterobacteriaeceae  <cit> . however it is less discriminatory and unclear for more closely related organisms. an alternative to rdna sequence analysis is the partial sequencing of protein-encoding genes. additionally, for determining phylogenetic relationships, sequence data from more than one gene should be used to reduce the possibly of ambiguities caused by genetic recombination or specific selection  <cit> . a number of such genes have been used as phylogenetic markers for members of the enterobacteriaceae. genes which have been analysed include rpob, gyrb, mdh, infb and reca  <cit> . these results can be more reliable for species identification and determining intra- and inter-generic relationships than 16s rdna gene sequencing. recently, kuhnert et al.  <cit>  used three loci  for  <dig> species of enterobacteriaceae including cronobacter spp. whereas our work is focussed on a higher resolution analysis of c. sakazakii and c. malonaticus using  <dig> loci. the genes under study were atpd, fusa, glns, gltb, gyrb, infb, and pps. these genes encode for atp synthase b subunit, elongation factor ef- <dig>  glutamyl-trna synthetase, glutamate synthase large subunit, type iia topoisomerase, initiation translation factor  <dig> and phosphoenol pyruvate synthase, respectively. these were compared with the previous biotyping scheme for cronobacter spp. and also considered the source and isolation date of the strains.

RESULTS
development of the cronobacter mlst scheme
several criteria were used in the selection of all potential loci. genes included were those encoding for putative housekeeping products necessary for biological roles in dna repair, replication and amino acid biosynthesis. genes that were either a) located near to or b) implicated as being, putative virulence factors and mobile elements were avoided as these may come under greater selective evolutionary pressures than other genes. the selected loci were distributed as much as possible across the chromosome to ensure that each locus was genetically unlinked. each gene fragment was also required to be approximately  <dig> bp in length to facilitate the design of universal nested primers for each locus preferably in conserved flanking regions around a variable central core. using these criteria, genes were selected and the chromosomal locations of all these loci were confirmed by bioinformatic analysis of the c. sakazakii baa- <dig> genome sequence .

the genes selected for the mlst scheme  are shown in table  <dig> along with putative gene products, gene sizes, primers and location within the c. sakazakii atcc baa- <dig> genome.

gene
allelic variation
novel sequence information for all seven loci was obtained from a collection of  <dig> c. sakazakii and  <dig> c. malonaticus strains. to assess the performance of the mlst scheme, cronobacter strains were selected to be representative of the different biotypes , and were also distributed both temporally and geographically in terms of their isolation . in silico sequence data was also obtained for all the loci from c. sakazakii strain atcc baa- <dig> , citrobacter koseri strain atcc baa- <dig> , and enterobacter species strain  <dig> . the latter strain sequence data was used to root the data set. the seven alleles obtained for the c. sakazakii genome reference strain baa- <dig> were identical to the online genome sequence .

the mean allele length was  <dig> bp for the scheme and ranged between  <dig> bp  and  <dig> bp  in length . all alleles within a particular locus were found to be of an identical length for all cronobacter strains examined. nucleotide sequence diversity at all seven loci is shown in table  <dig>  the proportion of variable sites varied from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  which extended over the whole section of the sequenced allele.

allele variation is not necessarily equally likely at every nucleotide of each locus. if a locus does not have a role affected by a selective pressure  then nucleotide substitutions would frequently not be expected to change the amino acid sequence  as changes are likely to be eliminated by purifying selection. by calculating the dn/ds ratio  the degree of selection operating on each locus can be estimated. the dn/ds ratio for all seven loci within cronobacter strains was found to be significantly less than  <dig>  ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>   , indicating that no strong positive selective pressure was present at any of the loci selected, validating their suitability for inclusion in the mlst scheme.

assignment of allele and sequence types
the number of different alleles resolved from this cronobacter mlst scheme at each locus ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  alleles. the mean number of allele types per locus was found to be  <dig> , providing the potential to distinguish > <dig> Ã—  <dig> different genotypes and also making it highly unlikely to obtain identical sequence types  by chance.

for the development of the mlst scheme, it was important to use a diverse collection of strains to obtain primarily different sts based upon known 16s rrna gene sequencing and biotype to validate the scheme's effectiveness across the two cronobacter species. for each unique allelic profile in the order atpd, fusa, glns, gltb, gyrb, infb and pps, a unique st was designated; see additional file  <dig> 

a total of  <dig> sts were found for the  <dig> strains examined ;  <dig> sts for for c. sakazakii ,  <dig> c. malonaticus ,  <dig> cit. koseri  and  <dig> enterobacter sp.  <dig> . the sequences of each allele type at all seven loci, along with the allelic profiles and sequence types used for the multilocus sequence sequence analysis  of the cronobacter strains examined are available at http://pubmlst.org/cronobacter/.

the close genetic relationship between c. sakazakii and c. malonaticus was evident in that atpd allele  <dig> was identified both in c. sakazakii  and c. malonaticus . apparently 'species specific' alleles were found across different sts e.g. the glns allele  <dig> was identified in c. sakazakii st  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  fusa allele  <dig> was in c. sakazakii st <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and three c. malonaticus sts had fusa allelic profile  <dig>  and st <dig> and st <dig> had gltb allelic profile  <dig> 

comparison of sequence type with source and biotype
in total  <dig> c. sakazakii and  <dig> c. malonaticus strains were analysed. most strains analysed were associated with previous publications . the earliest isolate  was from a can of dried milk powder, which was deposited in the culture collection in  <dig>  and the earliest clinical isolate  was deposited in  <dig>  <cit> .

c. sakazakii st <dig> contained infant formula isolates from 1988- <dig> from russia, netherlands, usa and uk. it included the atcc baa- <dig> strain from the tennesse nicu outbreak  <cit>  which has been sequenced . two strains were from milk powder and faeces. there were no known clinical outbreak isolates in st <dig>  c. sakazakii st <dig> was a single strain from infant formula in france   <cit> . this st varied by just a single nucleotide polymorphism from st <dig> with respect to the pps locus. c. sakazakii st <dig> strains were from infant formula, follow up formula, weaning food, and neonatal enteral feeding tubes. the strains were from 1988- <dig>  and were isolated in the netherlands, uk, and korea. there were no known clinical isolates, however there is no information available about the source for c. sakazakii strain atcc  <dig> in the culture collection.

c. sakazakii st <dig> was the major  sequence type among the isolates. it contained almost equal numbers of clinical  and infant formula  isolates. this st also included the betty hobbs  <dig> isolate from a can of dried milk   <cit> . in contrast, strains in c. sakazakii st <dig> were predominantly  clinical isolates from usa, canada, and czech republic. the isolation dates ranged from 1977- <dig>  and included the c. sakazakii type strain . the remaining strain was isolated in  <dig> from infant formula in france. c. sakazakii st <dig> included  <dig> strains from uk, usa, france and czech republic, at least  <dig> of which were clinical in origin.

c. malonaticus st <dig> contained  <dig> strains which were primarily clinical in origin from the czech republic, isolated between  <dig> and  <dig>  c. malonaticus st <dig> contained  <dig> clinical strains from the czech republic, biotypes 2a, 14a, and 13b which were isolated in  <dig>  <cit> . c. malonaticus st <dig> was composed of two strains from chinese herbs which were both isolated in  <dig> 

biotypes did not always correspond with sequence types or cronobacter species . for example, biotype  <dig> was primarily distributed over c. sakazakii st <dig> and  <dig>  with two other strains in st <dig>  the index strain for biotype 2a was in c. malonaticus st <dig>  and a second strain was in c. sakazakii st <dig>  biotype  <dig> was in c. sakazakii st <dig>   <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig>  c. malonaticus is defined as biotypes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . however biotype  <dig> was in c. malonaticus st <dig> and  <dig>  and c. sakazakii st <dig>  biotype  <dig> was only in c. malonaticus st <dig>  whereas biotype  <dig> and 14a were in c. malonaticus st <dig>  and st <dig>  biotypes 2a, 4a, 13a, and 13b are conventionally assigned to c. sakazakii  <cit> . however, c. malonaticus st <dig> included the index strains for biotypes 4a and 13a, and c. malonaticus st <dig> included the index strains for biotypes 2a and 13b.

relationships of c. sakazakii, c. malonaticus, cit. koseri and enterobacter sp.  <dig> using concatenated nucleotide sequences
in order to assess all the loci together in one tree, concatenated nucleotide sequences were used. concatenated nucleotide sequences  for the  <dig> cronobacter sts, cit. koseri and enterobacter sp.  <dig> were analysed using the upgma method . the cronobacter species were fully resolved, falling into distinctive clusters of strains. the cronobacter species were clearly separated from the enterobacter sp. strain  <dig> and also by a lesser extent from the cit. koseri strain . c. sakazakii and c. malonaticus separated from each other at  <dig> % divergence , and from citrobacter koseri at 13% divergence. figure  <dig> also shows the distribution of biotypes across the sequence types.

analysis of recombination among c. sakazakii
bacteria existing as clonal populations evolve diversity by the accumulation of point mutations, while non-clonal populations evolve more through recombination within or between species. in this study identical alleles were found within species and between the two cronobacter species .

evidence for clonal or recombining populations can be estimated by assessing the level of linkage between alleles at different loci around the chromosome. the index of association   <cit>  measures the extent of linkage. an ia not significantly greater than zero after  <dig>  computer randomizations would suggest that a single species population  is in linkage equilibrium , while a population with an ia significantly greater than zero  is considered to be in linkage disequilibrium . c. sakazakii examined had an ia value of  <dig>   and therefore indicates a more clonal that freely recombining population. further analysis will be undertaken as part of a subsequent study, along with other cronobacter spp..

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the diversity of enterobacter sakazakii was well acknowledged prior to the taxonomic revision to the cronobacter genus, which was based on dna-dna hybridisation, 16s rdna sequence analysis, and biotyping  <cit> . the earlier biotyping scheme was extremely useful in aiding the definition of the various cronobacter species, especially due to the close genetic relationship of c. sakazakii and c. malonaticus which initially was regarded as a subspecies of c. sakazakii  <cit> .

nevertheless, phenotyping is in part subjective, and a dna based scheme is preferred for its robustness. this study has used  <dig> loci for a mlst scheme for c. sakazakii and c. malonaticus. strains were chosen to represent the diversity of c. sakazakii and c. malonaticus based on biotype, geographic and temporal distribution, and source . the strains were from europe, usa, canada, russia, new zealand, korea and china. the isolation dates ranged over  <dig> years from  <dig> to  <dig> 

as mlst uses multiple loci, a greater degree of variation and better resolution for mlsa and for inferring evolutionary and epidemiological relatedness can be obtained than by a single locus alone. twelve sequence types of c. sakazakii were assigned. st <dig> contained the largest number of strains, both clinical, infant formula, and milk powder isolates, from usa, canada, europe and russia. the earliest isolate dates from  <dig> and demonstrates the ubiquity of this sequence type. many  of these strains were biotype  <dig>  which was previously shown to be the most numerous biotype   <cit> .

previously caubilla-barron et al.  <cit>  and townsend et al.  <cit>  reported on c. sakazakii infections in neonatal intensive care unit outbreak, which involved  <dig> pulsetypes. only one pulsetype  was associated with all the deaths and therefore indicated that c. sakazakii strains may vary in their virulence potential. pt <dig> strains caused necrotizing enterocolitis , septicaemia, and meningitis. these strains were all in st <dig>  other strains, associated with non-fatal nec, neonatal colonisation, and infant formulas were in st <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

st <dig> is of particular interest as 7/ <dig> strains were clinical in origin, the eighth isolate being isolated from infant formula. these organisms isolated between  <dig> and  <dig> were from usa, canada, france and the czech republic. st <dig> also contains the c. sakazakii type strain  and interestingly the index strains for biotypes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  some of these strains have previously been studied by pagotto et al.  <cit>  and postupa and aldovÎ±  <cit> . st therefore merits further investigation, as it may represent a particularly virulent type of c. sakazakii strains.

similarly st <dig> in c. malonaticus was dominated  by clinical isolates, however this grouping may be biased as  <dig> clinical isolates  were epidemiologically linked. there is also a predominance of biotype  <dig> in this sequence type, which may in part explain why that biotype was previously associated with clinical source; 10/ <dig> strains  <cit> .

the mlst scheme is openly available on the internet for other workers and will assist in the identification and discrimination of c. sakazakii and c. malonaticus based on dna sequence in place of the far less reliable biotyping approach, which in isolation is essentially of no phylogenetic value and little epidemiological value. the role of biotyping in the identification and discrimination of c. sakazakii and c. malonaticus needs to be seriously reviewed. even within the sample of isolates examined mlsa has already identified  <dig> or  <dig> sts which appear to be associated with enhanced virulence, and this may aid our understanding of the pathogenicity of this ubiquitous organism.
