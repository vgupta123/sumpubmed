BACKGROUND
viroids are small , single-stranded circular rna pathogens that self-replicate in the plants causing important economical losses in agricultural industries  <cit> . their genomes do not encode any protein, so they rely exclusively on host proteins. they are divided into two families: the pospiviroidae and the avsunviroidae. the members of the first family, for which the typical representative is the potato spindle tuber viroid , share a conserved central region, a nuclear localization and an asymmetric rolling circle replication that appears to involve host enzymes. members of the avsunviroidae, including the peach latent mosaic viroid , which is the viroid model in the present study, have been shown to accumulate in the chloroplasts  <cit> . the latter viroids possess hammerhead self-cleaving rna motifs and replicate according to a symmetric rolling circle mechanism.

plants accumulate a multitude of small non-coding rnas . the actions of most of these small rnas result in gene repression through what is called post-transcriptional gene silencing  to protect the plants from biotic stresses, like viroid or virus infection. besides their role in response to pathogens, these small rnas are also implicated in development and genome integrity  <cit> . based on the detection of small rnas, it has been established that viroids induce ptgs  <cit> . in addition, it has been demonstrated that a small hairpin derived from pstvd was sufficient to cause symptoms in its natural host, providing a potential explanation for the pathogenicity mechanism  <cit> . moreover the compact viroid structure makes them resistant to risc degradation  <cit>  at least in the case of pstvd. however, contradictory reports have shown that, under some circumstances, viroid-derived small rnas could protect the plants from viroid infection  <cit> , making the association between rna silencing and pathogenesis questionable.

in the case of plmvd, some aspects of the rna-silencing mechanism, including how it might trigger dicer-like enzyme activity, were studied using a cell-free wheat germ assay  <cit> . in addition, we recently reported the results of a sequencing effort directed towards the sirnas associated with plmvd infection in peach leaves  <cit> . specifically, a fraction of small, non-coding rnas  was isolated, cloned and sequenced according to the classical procedure for ncrnas, and any plmvd-derived sirnas that were found were then analyzed. this work yielded several interesting observations, including the fact that plmvd strands of both polarities may enter the peach rna silencing pathways. these observations should be considered with caution as they are based on the analysis of only  <dig> plmvd-derived sirnas, which out of  <dig> ncrnas detected in infected plant leaves, corresponds to only  <dig> × coverages of the viroid genome. moreover, since rna silencing in plant includes a phenomenon of amplification by an rna-dependent rna polymerase  <cit> , it was surprising to note that some regions of the genome were not covered by sirnas.

high-throughput sequencing  is a method that provides a relatively unbiased and direct digital readout of cdna sequences generated from an rna sample  <cit> . the unparalleled ability of hts to yield quantitative information on transcript abundance should help to give a more representative picture of the plmvd-derived sirna population than what is available right now. with the goal of obtaining a clearer view of the plmvd-derived sirnas, the sequencing of the small rnas associated with this infection was repeated using hts. concurrently, the viroid species present in rna samples used were also sequenced. the parallel sequencing of the viroid and derived sirnas retrieved within a unique rna sample should remove potential bias.

RESULTS
total rna was isolated from the leaves of one healthy and one plmvd-infected tree. plmvd infection was confirmed in the leaves of the infected tree by rt-pcr amplification, and could not be detected in the sample taken from the leaves of the healthy tree . subsequently, the dna pcr products derived from the plmvd amplification of the sample taken from the infected tree were isolated, cloned and sequenced. eighteen different plmvd sequences, varying from  <dig> to  <dig> nt in size , were obtained from the nineteen clones that were retrieved. these new sequences will be used in subsequent pairwise sequence comparison for the analysis of the plmvd-derived sirnas. all  <dig> sequences appeared to be new variants when they are compared to the  <dig> variants that have been reported to date in public libraries  <cit> . the sequence found twice was arbitrarily used for the representation depicted in figure 1b, and all mutations are reported in reference to this variant. this variant was folded according to the biochemically characterized secondary structure for another plmvd variant  <cit> . with the exception of minor local rearrangements, it appears to be a good fit to the proposed secondary structure. moreover, base pair covariations were observed at several positions, including several consecutive positions of the p <dig> stem in one variant . a total of  <dig> mutations, including substitutions of all types, deletions and insertions were detected throughout the plmvd genome. interestingly, in spite of the relatively important number of mutations observed in the p <dig> and p <dig> stems , all nucleotides critical for hammerhead self-cleavage activity were perfectly conserved. more importantly, all of the hammerhead sequences of both the plus  and the minus  polarities preserved the ability to fold into an active secondary structure due to the fact that base pair covariations occurred within the three critical stems that surround the catalytic core . this observation provides a strong indication that the sequences obtained are derived from plmvd species that possessed the ability to replicate, and not simply from dead-end products containing aberrant mutations.

concurrently, the small rnas  present in the rna sample above were isolated after fractionation on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. after the ligation of 5' and 3' adapters, these rnas were amplified by rt-pcr. after purification on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, the resulting dna samples were high-throughput sequenced using the illumina solexa technology. reads that did not contain the 3' linker, those shorter than  <dig> nt, and those with ambiguous nucleotides were discarded so as to reduce, as much as possible, any further bias or wrong identification. this trimming steps yielded libraries of  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> and  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> total reads for the healthy and the plmvd-infected samples, respectively . as a quality control, sequence homology searches were performed using the exonerate software  <cit>  allowing for no mismatches with arabidopsis thaliana rrna since the prunus persica genome sequence remains incomplete . nuclear, plastid and mitochondrial rrna sequences were retrieved, indicating that rna from the three compartments had been isolated. the rrna fractions present in the healthy and the plmvd-infected sequence collections were limited to only  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . these are relatively low levels of rrna, and provide a good indication of the samples' quality  <cit> .

the rna sequences were analyzed as a function of their size . the most abundant small rnas were those of  <dig> nt corresponding to dcl <dig> products  <cit>  and described as heterochromatic sirnas  <cit> , followed by those of  <dig> and  <dig> nt, as has been previously observed in other plant species  <cit> . importantly, a significantly higher amount of the  <dig> and  <dig> nt ncrnas were observed when the plmvd-infected sample was compared to that derived from the healthy leaves. specifically, if we combine the 21- <dig> nt fraction into one, it increases from  <dig> % in the healthy to  <dig> % in the infected samples, representing a  <dig>  fold increase , showing that the presence of plmvd clearly increases these sirnas populations.

subsequently, both libraries were analyzed for the presence of plmvd-derived sequences via a homology search using the novel variant viroid sequences. only  <dig> reads, corresponding to only  <dig> × 10- <dig> % of the total number , from the library derived from the healthy sample were found to be homologous with plmvd sequences. this low number simply represents the background noise. conversely,  <dig>  <dig> sequences from the library derived from the infected sample were found to be homologous with the eighteen plmvd sequences. this abundance of plmvd-associated small rnas corresponds to  <dig> % of the reads of the infected library, and is significantly greater than what is observed for two pospiviroidae family viroids   <cit>  that are known to accumulate in the nucleus). among the sequences complementary to plmvd, no apparent polarity bias was detected   <dig>  <dig> and   <dig> 283). the relative abundances of the plmvd replication intermediates of both polarities present in peach cells was previously estimated to be almost identical in a siberian c cultivar  and  polarities respectively, per mg of tissues  <cit> . this is the same order of magnitude, allowing for experimental error, as was previously suggested for other plmvd variants in a distinct peach cultivar  <cit> . this result confirms that if the plmvd genome or its replicative intermediates, enter the plant sirna pathways, both strands are susceptible to be implicated.

relatively few species larger than  <dig> nt in size  were found in the plmvd-associated sequence subset. in fact, most of the reads were either  <dig> or  <dig> nt in size . since dicer-like enzymes cleave double-stranded rna structures, it is tempting to assume that the viroid rna genome  can be substrates of those enzymes in vivo as shown for pstvd  <cit> . moreover, in vitro studies have shown that incubation of plmvd rna generates sirnas in a cell-free wheat-germ extract  <cit> . according to previous data using a genetic approach in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , more than one dicer-like enzyme can produce sirnas of 21- <dig> nt, rendering difficult and premature the identification of which one is involved with plmvd silencing.

the alignment of these sirnas along the plmvd genome showed that it was covered in its entirely, but that strong concentrations of sirnas were found in specific regions . for the  polarity, the sirnas appeared to predominantly concentrate on the upper strand of the p <dig> long stem in addition to a region covering from the p <dig> to the p <dig> stems. these observations are partially in agreement with the previous analysis based on a small subset of sirna sequences  <cit> . in this earlier case, the most abundant regions were found to be one strand of the p <dig> stem, the p <dig> stem and one strand of both the p <dig> and the p <dig> stems. with respect to the  polarity, the previous analysis did not permit the identification of the regions corresponding to the most abundant sirnas  <cit> . the results presented here show that the sirnas seem to be significantly more abundant in the p <dig> stem-loop region, and include fragments of both the p <dig> and p <dig> stems, in addition to part of one strand of the p <dig> stem, the p <dig> stem and one strand of the p <dig> stem . together the differences observed here clearly justify this new hts-based work.

clearly, the accumulated sirnas differ significantly for the two plmvd polarities. the secondary structures adopted by the plmvd strands of both polarities  <cit>  differ, and may have an important impact on this phenomenon. it is likely that the accessibility of the double-stranded structure to the dicer-like enzyme is an important criteria to consider. surprisingly, both the p <dig> and p <dig> stems of the  polarity, which interact through the p <dig> pseudoknot that should reduce their accessibility to the enzyme, appear to constitute a preferred region as evidenced by the high abundance of sirnas derived from this region. also the p <dig> stem is a long double stranded rna structure that could satisfy the dicer-like enzymes for cleavage; yet, our results show that it is not necessarily the case. for example, only one strand of the p <dig> stem of both polarities was observed to preferentially accumulate sirnas, while the other did not. one possible explanation might be that host proteins interact with the latter strand, thereby preventing dicer-like binding. interestingly, it is not the same strand of the p <dig> stem of both polarities that shows preferential accumulation. the reason for this phenomenon remains obscure. moreover, it has been reported that disease symptoms induced by the hop stunt viroid  in nicotina benthamiana were independent of viroid accumulation levels, and instead relied on the involvement of the rna-dependent rna polymerase  <dig>   <cit> . based on this, it is possible that dicer plays a relatively important role, but not as important as rdr <dig> potentially could, and that the over-represented regions in the pool of plmvd derived small rnas may actually reflect the action of rdr <dig> and other as yet unknown factors more than the activity of dicer-like proteins. if this is indeed the case, we can speculate that the viroids may potentially exert their pathogenicity through the tasirna pathway involving rdr <dig> and dcl- <dig>  as it has been previously hypothesized  <cit> . another aspect of the problem might be the preferential degradation of some sirnas by the cellular machinery

recent reports have shown that the sorting of small rnas into arabidopsis argonaute  complexes is influenced by the 5' terminal nucleotide  <cit> . in order to attribute the potential implication of specific ago complexes, the nature of the 5' nucleotide of plmvd-derived sirnas of 21- <dig> nt was analyzed. plmvd-derived rna of  <dig> nt in size contain  <dig> % of the time a u at the 5' end and  <dig> % a c . similarly, the plmvd-derived sirna of  <dig> nt harbor a u in the 5' end  <dig> % of the time and a c in  <dig> % . when the fraction of plmvd-derived sirna was removed from the library and the same analysis was repeated, the same bias for u and c was observed  and  <dig> %  for the  <dig> and  <dig> nt ncrna in size, respectively; data not shown). conversely, the analysis of the library of small non-coding rna obtained from the healthy leaves revealed a different bias for the nucleotide identity retrieved at the 5' end. the small rnas of  <dig> as well as  <dig> nt in size showed a significant preference for a a and g . in the latter case, the a was the most over-represented nucleotide in 5' . ago <dig> and ago <dig> were shown to preferentially recruit small rnas beginning by a u and a c, respectively  <cit> . taking into account this demonstration, the bias towards a u or a c in the 5' terminal nucleotide suggests that plmvd-derived small rnas, if they are implicated in the plant rna silencing pathways, may be recruited by ago <dig> and ago <dig>  if homologous protein complexes exist in the prunus genus. more generally, it is tempting to suggest that the active ago proteins in the infected plant cell differ from those retrieved in the healthy ones. however, this does not exclude that other ago proteins may be involved in the binding of those small rnas since plants may encode up to ten different ago proteins with redundant functions  <cit> .

lastly, in the previous analysis, the use of a minimal set of sirnas  <cit> , led to the proposal that a potential bias exists for the transportation of the circular conformers into the cytoplasm where they trigger further rna silencing. this hypothesis is based on the observation of a slightly larger proportion of sirnas that overlapped the self-cleavage site of plmvd, a species that is by definition derived only from circular conformers. according to the alignment illustrated in figure  <dig>  this is no longer the case. the regions that include the hammerhead self-cleavage sites are not part of the hotspots on the structure. however, plmvd-derived sirnas of both polarities are retrieved from the infected plant. also, no rna silencing components within the chloroplast have been described so far. these components are localized mainly in the cytoplasm. so the viroid needs to be transported into that compartment to be processed by the rna silencing machinery. these results suggest that, at least, the circular plmvd conformer of both polarities is transported into the cytoplasm from the chloroplast. this might also be the case for the linear monomers that are the most abundant replication intermediates  <cit> . importantly, this study clearly shows that any conclusion based on a relatively small number of sequences should be taken with considerable caution.

CONCLUSIONS
for the first time, all of the rna isolated from an infected tree have been used in parallel to sequence viroid species and small non coding rna species. on the one hand, this work led to the determination of  <dig> novel plmvd variants. on the other hand, the use of high throughput sequencing provided the largest library of sirna reported yet for a viroid infection. it was shown that the entire plmvd genome is retrieved in the sirna population. moreover, plmvd strands of both polarities appeared susceptible for targeting, although specific regions for each one are over-represented in terms of sirnas. those regions, which are not the same for each polarity, do not necessarily correlate with double-stranded regions that could be substrates for dicer-like enzymes. the nature of the first 5' nucleotide in the 21- <dig> nt population revealed a bias toward a c or a u in viroid-derived sirnas. in fact this bias is also observed in the non-plmvd-sirnas. unlike the infected library, the majority of the healthy sequences has a or g at their 5'. importantly, the large libraries of sirnas created in this study led to several observations concerning the silencing mechanism associated with plmvd infection.

at the same time this manuscript was being submitted, another study describing deep sequencing of small rnas associated to plmvd infection was released  <cit> . the authors have showed that plmvd of both polarities can generate predominantly small 21- <dig> nt long rnas in vivo. these small rnas map the plmvd genome adopting a hotspot profile which is different from one polarity to the other , although their libraries of plmvd-associated sirnas were smaller. however, the di serio et al. study has the advantage of reporting data isolated from two peach plants. the present study offers two important differences: firstly, the fact that the sequencing of the small ncrnas was also performed on a healthy plant ensures that there are no species showing homologies with plmvd. secondly, the plmvd sequences used to identify viroid-associated sirnas were obtained from the same sample as the small rnas instead of using sequences reported several years ago  <cit> . it has been shown that plmvd is a quasi-species and infection using a plasmid was sufficient for the observation of several sequences in a single plant  <cit> . there is another recent study that includes high throughput sequencing of small ncrnas from grapevine infected by hop stunt viroid and grapevine yellow speckle viroid  <dig>  two viroids from the other family   <cit> . clearly, high-throughput sequencing has become the method of choice for the identification of viroid-associated sirnas.
