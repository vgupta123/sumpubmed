BACKGROUND
chloroplasts are hypothesized to have evolved from ancient endosymbiotic cyanobacteria. they are semi-autonomous possessing their own genome that codes for a set of proteins, which orchestrate the process of photosynthesis and other house-keeping functions. the non-meiotic and mostly uniparental inheritance of chloroplast genes render them as most informational entities in plant phylogenetic studies. technological enhancements and consequent reduction of time in sequence capture have enabled sequencing of several chloroplast genomes recently. the discipline of plant phylogenetics has been the largest beneficiary of these technological advances. the phylogenetic trees derived from the analysis of whole genome sequences are completely or near-completely resolved, with highly supported nodes. further, analysis of chloroplast gene-evolution rates can be informative about nodal support as recently demonstrated in saxifragales where slow evolving genes from the chloroplast inverted repeat region provided support for deep level divergences  <cit> . despite the availability of these datasets, complete chloroplast genome sequence-based phylogenies are prone to artifacts caused by incomplete taxon sampling  <cit> . therefore, availability of complete chloroplast genome sequences from additional taxa is highly desirable for robust phylogenetic studies.

this study reports the complete chloroplast genome sequence from fagopyrum esculentum ssp. ancestrale, a wild ancestor of cultivated buckwheat  <cit> . this species belongs to the family polygonaceae. according to apgii  <cit>  polygonaceae is a member of the order caryophyllales; however this family represents a separate group within it, the so called non-core caryophyllales  <cit>  and sometimes it is treated as a separate order, polygonales  <cit> . both phylogenetic and genomic studies are lacking for this group. in addition, the affinities of the order caryophyllales as a whole also remain debatable. all chloroplast genome sequence-based phylogenies obtained till date place spinacia  as sister to asterids . other studies incorporating lesser number of genes but broader taxon sampling placed them at the base of the clade which includes asterids and rosids  <cit> . to validate if the sister relationship of caryophyllales and asterids is due to taxon undersampling in caryophyllales, additional sequence information is highly desirable. therefore, inclusion of the buckwheat chloroplast genome sequence in a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis is expected to aid in addressing the affinity issue of the caryophyllales.

the sequence of fagopyrum chloroplast genome, besides its phylogenetic implications, may provide useful information for more practical aspects. common buckwheat  is a widely cultivated multipurpose crop  <cit> . access to the chloroplast genome sequence may highlight other physiologically important traits in buckwheat. in addition, the chloroplast genome sequence can be utilized for developing species specific transformation vectors . therefore, the knowledge of the nucleotide sequence of buckwheat chloroplast genome opens up an avenue for the application of plastid genetic engineering to this plant.

methods
plant material
the seeds of fagopyrum species used in this study were obtained from all-russia research institute of legumes and groat crops. plant material for persicaria, rheum, reynoutria and coccoloba was obtained from moscow state university botanical garden.

dna extraction, amplification and sequencing
total cellular dna was isolated from fresh leaf tissue using nucleospin plant dna kit  following manufacturer's instructions. pcr amplification was performed on ptc- <dig> dna engine dyad  using encyclo pcr kit . for amplification, pcr conditions recommended in  <cit> , i. e.  <dig> cycles of touchdown pcr with the decrease of annealing temperature from  <dig> to  <dig> deg c, were used. for some primer pairs, pcr was performed with optimization of gradient pcr involving altered annealing temperatures. for long pcr, extension was performed at  <dig> deg c for  <dig> â€“  <dig> minutes, depending on the expected amplicon size. pcr products were purified using gel extraction & pcr cleanup kit . automated sequencing was performed on abi  <dig> sequencer using the big dye terminator v. <dig>  sequencing kit .

sequencing strategy and primer design
the sequence of buckwheat chloroplast genome was obtained using a pcr based approach, similar to the asap method described earlier in  <cit> . the inverted repeat region of the fagopyrum chloroplast genome was amplified and sequenced with the asap primers; the large and small single copy regions were amplified using pcr primers developed from the multiple alignment of known chloroplast genome sequences of angiosperms . these universal primers enabled amplification of the entire chloroplast genome of fagopyrum with overlapping pcr fragments ranging in size from  <dig>  to  <dig> kb. long fragments had to be generated due to a lack of sequence conservation in the aligned chloroplast genomes and few structural changes . the larger fragments were amplified and sequenced with taxon-specific primers using a primer walking approach .

contig assembly and annotation
sequences generated from a primer pair were first aligned using blast  <dig> sequences  tool  <cit> , available at ncbi website to develop contigs which were then assembled using the bioedit software  <cit> . draft genome annotation was generated using the organelle annotation package dogma  <cit> . the predicted annotations were further verified using blast similarity search  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis
for the phylogenetic analysis, a set of  <dig> protein-coding genes derived from  <dig> chloroplast genomes was collected . the species included in the analysis represent all major lineages of angiosperms for which the chloroplast genome sequences have been reported till date.

gene sequences were parsed to detect frameshift mutations and edited when necessary. sequences were translated into derived amino acid sequences, which were further aligned using muscle ver.  <dig>   <cit>  followed by manual correction. nucleotide sequence alignment was overlaid on the amino acid sequence alignment.

phylogenetic analyses using maximum parsimony  method was performed using paup* ver.  <dig> b <dig>  <cit> . bayesian inference of phylogeny was explored using the mrbayes program ver.  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . alternative topologies test was performed with the tree-puzzle program  <cit> .

mp analysis involved a heuristic search using tree bisection and reconnection  branch swapping and  <dig> random addition replicates. non-parametric bootstrap analysis  <cit>  was performed with  <dig> replicates with tbr branch swapping. both nucleotide and amino acid sequences were included in the analysis.

bayesian analysis was also performed using both amino acid and nucleotide sequence datasets. for nucleotide sequence analyses different partitioning strategies were employed: each gene as a separate partition , combination of genes according to their function  and partitioning according to codon position . for each of the  <dig> amino acid partitions, the most appropriate model of substitutions was determined by the bic  in modelgenerator ver.  <dig>   <cit> . similarly for each nucleotide partition, the most appropriate model of nucleotide substitution was determined by the aic  in modeltest ver.  <dig>   <cit> .

bayesian analysis was performed with three chains in each of the two runs. each chain started with a random tree,  <dig> replicates for amino acid data and  <dig> replicates for nucleotide data were generated. the trees thus obtained were sampled every  <dig> generations. the proportion of invariable sites and the shape of gamma-distribution rates were unlinked across partitions. the number of discarded trees was determined using convergence diagnostics.

RESULTS
overall structure and gene content of buckwheat chloroplast genome
the genbank accession number for the nucleotide sequence reported in this study is eu <dig>  complete chloroplast genome of fagopyrum esculentum ssp. ancestrale is composed of  <dig> nucleotide bases. this exceeds the average size of flowering plants chloroplast genomes ~ <dig> kb and, in particular, almost  <dig> kb larger then the chloroplast genome of its closest relative spinacia oleracea . the observed increase in size is due to the expansion of the inverted repeat  region. the size of the ir region is  <dig>  the large single copy  and the small single copy  regions are  <dig> and  <dig> bp respectively. overall at-content of the entire plastome is 62%, the lsc and ssc are 63% and 68% at respectively and inverted repeat is 59% at rich. this is comparable with the other land plant chloroplast genomes . the lower at% of the ir region reflects the lower at-content of ribosomal rna genes.

the gene order and content of the buckwheat chloroplast genome is identical to that of spinacia . this similarity is discernible not only in the functional genes but also in the pseudogenes. in both buckwheat and spinacia chloroplast genome, the sequences representing rpl <dig> and ycf <dig> genes are interrupted by the internal stop codons, indicating their pseudogene status. the latter situation is quite commonly observed amongst angiosperms: detailed studies of the evolutionary pattern of this region have revealed that ycf <dig> gene is not a protein-coding gene  <cit> . on the contrary, rpl <dig> gene is known to be present and functional in most flowering plants  <cit> . therefore, pseudogenization of this gene may represent a feature that is unique to caryophyllids. thus far, four sequences of the rpl <dig> region have been reported for caryophyllids; beet , spinach, buckwheat and silene latifolia, . comparative analysis of the four sequences reveals that all of them harbor mutations; however their exact structure is different . in buckwheat there is a  <dig> bp insertion, which affects the reading frame, leading to the generation of a stop codon. beta and spinacia share a common  <dig> bp deletion, which also alters the reading frame. interestingly in silene this region seems to be less affected. it does not harbor any frameshift mutations however the gene has a stop codon near the 5'-end. this observation cannot serve as the sole evidence for this gene being non-functional as a stop codon can be edited to a sense codon by the commonly observed phenomenon of rna editing in the chloroplasts. a sequencing artifact could be the other plausible explanation for the presence of the stop codon. to evaluate if the pseudogenization of rpl <dig> gene is a common structural feature of caryophyllid plastomes, additional sequence information from other species is required. transcription of the rpl <dig> gene has been experimentally demonstrated in spinach however protein products were not detected in this study  <cit> . therefore it is plausibly an expressed pseudogene. a similar situation may exist in the case of buckwheat as well.

another feature that is shared between fagopyrum and spinacia plastomes is the presence of two genes â€“ psbl and ndhd â€“ with an acg initiation codon. c to u rna editing-mediated creation of the aug initiation codon from the original acg codon is a common phenomenon observed in case of chloroplast genome-derived transcripts. rna editing has been experimentally demonstrated for psbl  <cit>  and ndhd genes in tobacco. the editing of ndhd gene has also been reported in spinach and snapdragon  <cit> . since psbl and ndhd genes code for proteins essential for chloroplast function, it is safe to assume that their transcripts are edited in fagopyrum. this can be substantiated with the help of cdna sequencing or other experimental evidence in future studies. interestingly, there are two structural features that are unique to the fagopyrum plastome. first is the position of the ir-ssc borders relative to other plastid genomes. in spinacia the ira/ssc border resides with in the 3' region of ycf <dig> gene. the remaining ycf <dig> gene lies in the ssc; a copy of the 3'region of ycf <dig> gene located in the irb produces the ycf <dig> pseudogene at the irb/ssc border. buckwheat possesses an expanded ir region and two full-length copies of ycf <dig> gene are thus generated.

second, buckwheat plastid genome is comprised of  <dig> intron-containing genes compared to spinach in which the number of these genes is reduced to  <dig>  this difference is due to the loss of rpl <dig> intron in spinach  <cit> . the loss of intron in rpl <dig> gene has occurred independently in several lineages of flowering plants  <cit>  and it is considered to be a characteristic feature observed in the members of the core caryophyllales. thus, the presence of the rpl <dig> intron in buckwheat  emphasizes the distinction of this group from the core caryophyllales. the rpl <dig> intron has also been reported in rumex, another representative of polygonaceae, and in the members of plumbaginaceae, a family that is close to polygonaceae and often associated with caryophyllales  <cit> .

expansion of the inverted repeat region in buckwheat chloroplast genome
the size and thus the boundary of the chloroplast genome inverted repeat  region is variable amongst different plant species  <cit> . previous studies on ir borders have mainly focused on the ir and the lsc junction  <cit>  that revealed multiple instances of expansion and contraction in the ir region, ranging from a few base pairs to more than  <dig> kb.

the expanded ir region in buckwheat represents an average increase of  <dig> kb when compared with other flowering plants. the observed expansion and the sequence of the enhanced ir region in other fagopyrum species has been reported previously  <cit> . this region was shown to be highly similar to the small single copy  region adjacent to ira in other dicot chloroplast genomes which enabled the conclusion that this expansion is due to the inclusion of the ssc sequences.

the sequence information generated in the present study confirms the expansion of the ir in fagopyrum esculentum ssp. ancestrale. in contrast to most angiosperms, the expansion encompasses the ycf <dig> gene a conserved chloroplast orf found in all known dicot and some monocot chloroplast genomes. its exact function is unknown but together with another conserved chloroplast orf ycf <dig>  it has been shown to be vital for chloroplast function in tobacco  <cit> . in most instances, the ir region contains only a part of the ycf <dig> gene with the other part located in the ssc region of the plastome. the length of ycf <dig> gene that is duplicated ranges from  <dig> bp in nymphaea to  <dig> bp in amborella  <cit> . however, inclusion of the ycf <dig> gene in the ir region was also reported in a monocot lemna minor  <cit> , in an asterid jasminum nudiflorum  <cit>  and ipomoea purpurea  <cit> . given that these taxa belong to diverse lineages of flowering plants, the expansion of ycf <dig> gene has most probably appeared independently in each of these groups from an ancestral amborella-like chloroplast genome. moreover, the exact mode of ycf <dig> gene expansion varies in different species . for example, in jasminum the ir/ssc border is positioned within the ycf1-ndhf spacer region on one border and the other border is positioned within the rps15-ycf <dig> spacer. in lemna the duplication encompasses rps <dig> gene and 5' region of the ndhh gene. in ipomoea this expansion extends even further and includes the complete ycf <dig> gene, rps <dig> gene, ndhh gene, and a short region of ndha gene's first exon. in case of buckwheat the expanded region includes the ycf1-ndhf spacer and  <dig> bp of the 3' end of ndhf gene.

it is interesting to note that the sequence of the expanded region in fagopyrum esculentum ssp. ancestrale is different from the sequence reported by aii et al.  <cit> . the authors had reported a  <dig> bp inversion within this region. this inversion affected the transcriptional continuity of ycf <dig> gene, causing an interruption in its reading frame. the observed difference in the sequence reported in this study could be plausibly explained by the use of different genotypes of buckwheat. however, the reported inversion could be potentially employed for tracing the origin of various buckwheat cultivars. importantly, the set of buckwheat-specific primers reported in this work are expected to enable future studies of this and other potentially interesting structural features.

we further investigated the expansion of the ir in other species related to fagopyrum esculentum spp. ancestrale using a pcr based approach with two sets of primers . one primer in each set annealed to the ndhf and rps <dig> genes within the ssc. the other primer is common to both sets and anneals to the ycf <dig> gene. it has only one annealing site within the ssc in chloroplast genomes that do not possess the ir expansion , but two annealing sites  in the ir of the species which have two copies of ycf <dig> due to the ir expansion .

these studies revealed that the observed expansion of the ir was present in all polygonaceae members sampled in the study that included two additional buckwheat species examined besides f. esculentum . similar ir expansion was observed in persicaria, rheum, reinoutria and coccoloba species as well . for buckwheat species the expansion of the ir was further confirmed by sequencing of the irb/ssc and ssc/ira borders . thus from these studies it is clear that the expansion is not only a characteristic of fagopyrum, but also for some other related genera and this may represent a common feature of polygonaceae. comparative analysis of the various sequences derived from buckwheat species revealed minor variations in the fine structure of the ir/ssc border. in f. esculentum and f. homotropicum ssc/ir borders are identical and lie within the ndhf gene  and  <dig> bp upstream of the rps <dig> gene . overall the rps15-ycf <dig> spacer region is included in the ir in the above-mentioned species while in f. tataricum rps <dig> gene and  <dig> bp of rps15-ycf <dig> intergenic spacer region are located in the ssc. based on the phylogenetic analysis of nuclear and chloroplast loci f. esculentum and f. homotropicum are closely related to each other  <cit> . the fine structure of ir/ssc borders in these species is consistent with these data and further studies of this region can be of utility to illustrate additional phylogenetic relationships within fagopyrum.

phylogenetic analysis
in order to determine the relative position of fagopyrum amongst angiosperms comparative phylogenetic analyses of available plastid genome sequences was performed. the data set consisted of  <dig> concatenated protein-coding gene sequences from  <dig> different taxa, including two gymnosperm species as outgroups. nucleotide and amino acid data sets contained  <dig> and  <dig> characters respectively after the exclusion of ambiguous alignment positions.

maximum parsimony  analyses of all aligned nucleotide positions resulted in a single fully resolved tree, in which most of the nodes gained high support in bootstrap analyses  except for the placement of chloranthus. mp analysis of amino acid data also produced a single tree, but its topology was different for the placement of vitis , cucumis , platanus  and chloranthus .

the topologies of the bayesian trees derived from the partitioned nucleotide matrix and amino acid sequence analyses were identical  regardless of the chosen partitioning scheme. exclusion of the third codon position from the bayesian analysis resulted in a similar tree with the exception of amborella uniting with nymphaeales.

it has been demonstrated previously that the partitioning of complex datasets greatly improves the performance of bayesian inference  <cit> . thus, we employed different partitioning schemes  in our analyses however, comparison of the resulting trees showed no difference in the resulting tree topologies. at the same time dividing the dataset into  <dig> partitions seemed more logical if harmonic means of marginal likelihoods were compared .

in general, our inferred chloroplast phylogenies are very similar to recently published molecular trees, in which the interrelationships and the monophyly of magnoliids, monocots and eudicots were strongly supported  <cit> . in all the derived phylogenetic trees, fagopyrum and spinacia  form a sister clade to asterids. to determine if alternative topologies with placement of caryophyllales as a sister group to rosids  or to rosids and asterids  can be distinguished, a shimodaira-hasegawa test  <cit>  was conducted and expected-likelihood weights  <cit>  were calculated using rell optimization  <cit> . according to the results of these tests, the alternative placement of caryophyllales is significantly worse than the optimal topology, supporting a close relationship of caryophyllales and asterids .

a clade of rosids, with grape being basal among them, is sister to asterids and caryophyllales. notably in our dataset inclusion of morus sequence leads to stabilization of cucumis position and in all our analyses the eurosids i are monophyletic. in the most recently published phylogenetic trees based on chloroplast sequences, the placement of cucumis was unstable. it either united with myrtaceae  in the bayesian trees or nested within eurosids i in the mp trees  <cit> . a close relationship of morus and cucumis has been demonstrated previously  <cit>  and in our bayesian trees these species form a cluster with a high posterior probability value. such grouping is questionable based on our mp analysis and a previously reported analysis of  <dig> plastid genomes  <cit>  that place them as a grade. however, it is obvious that eurosids i may be considered monophyletic.

ranunculus and nandina appear to constitute the basal most clade within eudicots. buxus is the closest ally to core eudicots in all the derived trees, whereas the position of platanus among basal eudicots cannot be firmly determined. its intermediate position is not supported in the mp analysis with bootstrap resampling of amino acid sequences.

amborella, nymphaeales, chloranthales and magnoliids remain the most problematic groups in angiosperm phylogeny. their phylogenetic relationships are still equivocal and are dependent on the method and data used during analyses. none of the alternative hypotheses concerning amborella  and chloranthus  can be rejected on the basis of phylogenetic analysis of the chloroplast genome sequences  <cit> . obviously, limited taxon sampling is the first weakness of the chloroplast phylogeny analyses at the current stage, therefore the problem cannot be resolved until additional representatives from basal angiosperms and gymnosperms are included in the analyses to obtain robust relationships. the same holds true for monocots and eudicots as long as many important lineages are missing. one should not be deluded by high bootstrap or posterior probability values, because high support for a doubtful clade is often obtained when a very large number of characters  but small number of taxa are used in phylogenetic analysis. for example, calycanthus in some trees was placed as a sister to eudicots with high or moderate support  <cit>  until additional magnoliids were included in the analyses  <cit> . to overcome the issue of taxon sampling, it is worth identifying genes that are most efficient for phylogenetic analysis and then to analyze these genes in more taxa. recently rpo genes, coding for plastid rna-polymerase subunits, have been shown to generate the topology of a phylogenetic tree similar to the whole plastid genomes phylogeny  <cit> . another example is the use of slowly evolving genes encoded in the chloroplast inverted repeat region that have helped to resolve phylogenetic relationships within saxifragales  <cit> .

distribution of acg initiation codon in rpl <dig>  psbl and ndhd genes in angiosperms in the phylogenetic context
several chloroplast genes in angiosperm plastomes are known to possess an atypical initiation codon acg. for some species  there is strong experimental evidence that this codon is edited to the standard aug codon  <cit>  suggesting that similar mechanism may exist in other species. since rna editing patterns are thought to be the subjects of extensive parallel evolution, they are not necessarily phylogenetically informative  <cit> . however, for three plastid genes â€“ rpl <dig>  psbl and ndhd â€“ a correlation between rna editing and phylogeny has been reported  <cit> . this study was based on sequences from  <dig> angiosperms plastomes; it was concluded that rna editing in psbl gene emerged in a common ancestor of angiosperms that was then lost in monocots. editing of rpl <dig> gene emerged only in monocots and for ndhd gene it was observed only in dicots  <cit> .

the availability of a large number of complete chloroplast genome sequences from angiosperms and improved knowledge about flowering plant phylogeny allows re-evaluation of this conclusion. we performed a survey of the potential rna editing sites in the initiation codons of rpl <dig>  psbl and ndhd in  <dig> seed plant chloroplast genomes sequenced till date  and studied its distribution in different evolutionary lineages using phylogenetic trees reported in this article as a framework . foremost, our analyses indicate that among seed plants the acg initiation codon in rpl <dig> gene is not only a characteristic of monocots, but also of some early divergent angiosperms  and lower eudicots . however, it is absent in illicium and nymphaeales that are also the representatives of basal lineages of angiosperms. thus, it is difficult to conclude that the rna editing at this site emerged in a common ancestor of angiosperms and then was lost in illicium and nymphaeales. alternatively, it may have evolved later, after the divergence of the members of anita grade and its occurrence in amborella may be due to parallel evolution. the editing in ndhd gene seemed to have evolved in a common ancestor of angiosperms and then lost in nymphaea and in some monocots. in all the grasses studied till date ndhd gene has a standard atg initiation codon  <cit>  suggesting that it may be common for all the members of this family. the pattern of distribution of the acg initiation codon in psbl gene is more complex. its presence is characteristic for most of the early divergent angiosperms , but absent in all sampled monocots and in several different lineages of eudicots. we assume that the presence of the acg initiation codon  in this gene is an ancestral character state for angiosperms and its absence is due to multiple parallel losses. however this observation needs to be verified further using broader taxon sampling.

CONCLUSIONS
complete sequence of buckwheat  chloroplast dna has been generated using a pcr based approach validating the utility of this approach especially for non-rearranged angiosperm chloroplast genomes. this represents the first sequenced plastid genome of the family polygonaceae and of non-core caryophyllales. gene content and order of buckwheat plastome is similar to that of spinacia oleracea, its relative from core caryophyllales. however two structural differences have been revealed. first of them is the presence of an intron in rpl <dig> gene and the second is the expansion of inverted repeat region. the exact structure of the expanded region is different from previously reported data and includes an intact orf for the ycf <dig> gene.

phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> protein-coding genes in  <dig> taxa, including newly obtained chloroplast genome sequence  provides strong support for the sister relationships of caryophyllales sensu lato  and asterids. most of other conclusions from previous phylogenetic studies of chloroplast genomes are also confirmed, in particular the placement of amborella  as a basalmost angiosperm, sister relationships of chloranthus and magnoliids and the position of ranunculales  as the earliest diverging lineage of eudicots.

the study of distribution of the potential rna editing sites in the initiation codon of rpl <dig>  psbl and ndhd genes in angiosperms reveals some correlations with the phylogeny though confirms that the evolution of rna editing is a subject of extensive parallel changes.
