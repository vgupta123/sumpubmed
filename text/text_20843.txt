BACKGROUND
several statistical tests have been developed to identify the genomic regions that have been subjected to strong recurrent selection. most have been based on extreme population differentiation
 <cit> , the enrichment of rare mutations in the site frequency spectrum
 <cit> , or patterns of extended haplotype homozygosity
 <cit>  . these tests have now been used to detect molecular signatures of selection in cattle
 <cit> . however, recently, there has been a call to employ polygenic models to simultaneously identify loci responding to selection but that do not fit the typical “hard sweep” paradigm
 <cit> .

concurrent with the development of new approaches for the detection of selective sweeps, the statistical models employed for genome-wide association studies have been improved. some of the refinements deal with the effects of population structure and kinship between sampled individuals, since not accounting for these effects can significantly increase the number of false positive associations . it has been shown that fitting a genomic relationship matrix  effectively prevents false positives due to population structure and kinship
 <cit> . furthermore, there has also been a shift toward the application of polygenic models for the identification of genetic risk factors and variants associated with complex phenotypes
 <cit> .

in this study, we merge the search for loci responding to selection with advanced genome-wide association models to quantify the genome-wide response to selection in us registered angus cattle. we introduce a novel method, birth date selection mapping, for identifying loci that are responding to ongoing selection.

selection induces changes in allele frequency for the selected mutation, as well as for neighbouring loci that hitchhike along with the selected locus due to the presence of linkage disequilibrium between the loci. accordingly, individual allele counts  could be regressed on birth date using a poisson model to identify loci that have rapidly changed in frequency over time. however, in the presence of any sampling bias , this approach suffers from a very high false-positive rate of detection of loci subject to selection . the bias results from a pedigree-based stratification in the depth of sampling of dna on individuals within different families and differences in allele frequencies between families such that the differences in allele frequencies between families are partially confounded with differences in allele frequencies in time. in other words, this approach is confounded by pedigree relationships and the non-random sampling of individuals from families at different time points. the use of a mixed linear model with allele counts or frequencies fit as the dependent variable and a random animal term fit using a numerator or genomic relationship matrix does not solve the problem because any time-dependent trend in allele frequency is now incorporated into the solutions for animal effects .

in our approach, rather than regressing allele frequencies  on birth date , we invert the relationship and fit birth date as the dependent variable and identify snps that are strongly associated or predictive of birth date. if a neutral dna variant is drifting through a population, changes in allele frequency will be stochastic and small provided the effective population size  is large. for these variants, the probability of a specific genotype will be approximately constant in time and knowledge of an individual’s genotype will not be strongly predictive of that individual’s birth date. on the other hand, if a variant is under strong directional selection, changes in allele frequency will be consistent in direction and may become large over several generations. for these variants, genotype will be predictive of birth date. for example, if the a allele is increasing in frequency in time, aa individuals are much more likely to be born recently than in the distant past. we utilize mixed model methods to account for the pedigree-based structure in our sample through the use of the genomic relationship matrix
 <cit> . with the analysis framed from this perspective, we identify the snps that are changing in frequency due to selection while accounting for kinship within the sample. by so doing, we are the first to apply polygenic models for the detection of genomic imprints of selection.

RESULTS
evidence of selection
deregressed estimated breeding values 
 <cit>  for  <dig> production traits  were regressed on birth date  for  <dig>  registered angus animals . for traits that can easily be appraised and for which expected progeny differences  were implemented earlier in the development of the breed , selection has significantly changed the breed additive genetic mean over time. for traits for which increased production has consistently been sought by producers, such as weaning weight, yearling weight, and milk, additive genetic means have increased linearly . however, additive genetic means for birth weight, yearling height, mature weight, and mature height increased until the mid-1980s when breeders recognized the detrimental effects of large birth weights on calving difficulty and large mature size on cow maintenance requirements and fertility, and these traits were subsequently selected to decrease . for these traits, the quadratic regression models have a much smaller akaike information criterion , larger adjusted r <dig> values, and smaller p-values . traits with recently developed epds, such as docility and heifer pregnancy rate, show little change in additive genetic mean over time . docility and heifer pregnancy rate had among the smallest r <dig> values of all the fitted linear and quadratic regression models. additive genetic means for growth traits  and for the incidence of unassisted births  have increased annually. weaning weight has increased, on average, by  <dig>  pounds per year and the rate of unassisted births  has increased by  <dig> % per year—remarkable achievements by angus breeders considering the 50-year span of these data.

birth date selection mapping
we applied our birth date selection mapping method to this data set using three mixed models. we first estimated allele substitution effects  for birth date for  <dig>  snps using genomic best linear unbiased prediction 
 <cit>  applied to  <dig>  registered angus cattle, but we do not report results for the  <dig> snps that map to unassigned contigs in the umd <dig>  reference assembly
 <cit> . the gblup analysis simultaneously fits all snps as random effects and does not estimate p-values for tests of significance of individual snps. rather, ases were converted to estimates of additive genetic variance associated with each snp and plotted .

we next used emmax
 <cit>  to individually estimate snp ases as fixed effects and q-values representing the expected proportion of false positives among all snp effects as extreme as observed for the current snp
 <cit> . compared to the poisson regression of allele counts on birth date , the significance values were not inflated for this analysis , demonstrating this analysis appropriately models kinship relationships. additional file
1: figure s <dig> further demonstrates that we have sufficient power to identify significant associations. this approach is quite conservative and indicates that strong selection has caused large changes in allele frequency at only a small number of loci on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . the two peaks on chromosome  <dig> contain the major histocompatibility complex  and numerous olfactory receptors.

finally, we used gensel
 <cit>  to fit a non-linear bayescπ model
 <cit>  in which the parameter π estimates the proportion of snps that are not associated with the dependent variable. we estimated π to be  <dig> , and thus  <dig> %  of the snps were estimated to be predictive of birth date and therefore putatively exposed to strong selection. bayescπ employs a mcmc approach in which 1-π of the snps are sampled for inclusion in the model in each chain and the jointly estimated snp ases are finally shrunk according to the proportion of times each snp is retained in the selected model. thus, snps that are rarely retained in the model have their ases strongly shrunk towards zero. this analysis found strongly selected loci on all chromosomes .

the snp ases estimated with gblup and emmax had a spearman correlation of  <dig>  and a pearson correlation of  <dig> . the difference in ase magnitude identified by the pearson correlation essentially reflects the difference in estimates achieved due to fitting snps as uncorrelated random or fixed effects. the snp ases estimated by gblup and bayescπ had a spearman correlation of  <dig> , but had a pearson correlation of only  <dig>  due to the strong shrinkage of large effect snps in gblup  and the strong shrinkage of small effect snps in bayescπ. the emmax and bayescπ ases had a spearman correlation of  <dig>  and pearson correlation of  <dig> . in the gblup and emmax analyses, the multilocus genotypes explained  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the variance in birth date , respectively, as estimated using restricted maximum likelihood  estimation of variance components. in the bayescπ analysis, genotypes explained  <dig>  of the variance in birth date.

effective population size and drift
to ascertain whether drift is a significant force influencing allele frequency changes within the artificially selected us angus breed, we estimated the inbreeding effective population size, under the neutral model, and modelled the effects of drift on neutral loci. using a pedigree of up to  <dig> generations and which comprised  <dig>  angus animals including the  <dig>  genotyped animals and all known ancestors, we estimated the generation interval for us angus cattle to be  <dig>  years, which was the average age of animals born between  <dig> and  <dig> at the birth of their male and female registered progeny. from this pedigree, we also estimated inbreeding coefficients  for all animals from which we estimated effective population size from the regression of f on generation number. from a principal component analysis of the snp genotypes, we identified two distinct subgroups within our sample. in additional file
1: figure s <dig>  we identified the wye angus herd
 <cit>  which was formed from an importation of bulls from the british isles and then closed to new germplasm in  <dig> as a group that was distinct from the remaining us registered angus cattle. the inbreeding effective population size for the wye herd was estimated to be  <dig>  ±  <dig> , whereas the estimate for the remaining north american angus was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  using animals born after  <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  using animals born after  <dig> . for each of the  <dig>  snps, we constructed a test  to determine whether the observed change in allele frequency could be explained by drift or alternatively must be due to selection. from this analysis, we found that the observed allele frequency changes exceeded the likely changes due to drift for  <dig> % of the  <dig>  snps.

 <dig> for regression parameter estimates.

birth year generations were calculated by subtracting  <dig> from each animal’s birth year and dividing by the generation interval of  <dig> years. birth year generation = / <dig> 

we also compared genomic with pedigree estimates of f. the realized genomic f have a larger variance  than do the pedigree f , and the two measures of f had a pearson correlation of  <dig>  , which is consistent with the underestimation of pedigree f due to the assumption that f is zero for all individuals in the base generation, pedigree errors, and incomplete pedigree information. we regressed pedigree f on genomic f, and found the slope of the regression to be  <dig>  ±  <dig> . separate regressions for the wye and north american angus revealed pedigree and genomic f coefficients to be more similar for the wye herd than for the remaining north american angus cattle . when genomic f was regressed on pedigree f, the slope of the regression was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  with an adjusted r <dig> of  <dig> .

because estimates of genomic f coefficients are based on fewer assumptions than are pedigree estimates , we also estimated ne using the genomic f coefficients for north american angus animals born after  <dig>  this resulted in an ne of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . using this ne in our drift test, we estimated that allele frequency changes exceeded those likely due to drift for  <dig> % of the  <dig>  snps.

applying birth date selection mapping to smaller sample sizes
we appreciate that not all species will have the large samples that are available for agriculturally important species for birth date selection mapping. to assess the effects of sample size and birth date range, we created four subsamples from our data set that were analysed using emmax. the first subsample contained  <dig>  animals from pedigree generations  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . the second contained  <dig> animals, consisting of  <dig> animals randomly sampled from each of pedigree generations  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . the third consisted of  <dig>  animals randomly sampled from the entire data set . the final sample included  <dig> animals randomly sampled from the entire data set . additional file
1: figures s <dig> and s <dig> show that only the third data set had sufficient power to identify loci under selection with genome-wide significance. comparing additional file
1: figures s20a and s20d suggests that increasing the time period over which individuals are sampled improves power more than does increasing sample sizes using contemporary individuals. selection would likely have to be extremely strong and focussed on monogenic traits to identify selected loci using small samples of contemporaries .

connecting selected phenotype to selected genotype
we analysed deregressed ebvs in a weighted analysis
 <cit>  for  <dig> production traits  using data provided by the american angus association  under an animal model that incorporated a genomic relationship matrix and from which we estimated the proportion of additive genetic variance explained by the snp markers . with the exception of two qtls on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  most genes influencing variation in growth traits in angus cattle are of small effect . the most likely location of the pleiotropic qtl on chromosome  <dig> was found to be at  <dig>  mbp in the gblup analyses, and the snp at this location, rs <dig>  was among the most strongly associated of all snps with ced, bw, ww, yw, hp, cem, milk, mw, mh, cw, marb, re, and fat . however, the strongest selection signal found on this chromosome was found at  <dig>  mbp  by gblup, at  <dig>  mbp by bayescπ , and a small, but not significant, birth date selection signal was found at  <dig>  mbp in the emmax results . the birth date effect for rs <dig> was ranked  <dig>  out of the  <dig>  snp effects . the most likely location of the pleiotropic qtl on chromosome  <dig> was estimated to be at the position of snp rs <dig> at  <dig>  mbp . selection signals were detected at  <dig>  mbp in the gblup and at  <dig>  mbp in the emmax analyses of birth date. the birth date effect for snp rs <dig> was ranked  <dig>  out of the  <dig>  snp effects .

to assess the identity of the trait or combination of traits that have historically been under selection in angus cattle and that produced the molecular signals of selection, we individually regressed the snp ases for birth date on standardized snp ases  for all  <dig> production traits for which the aaa routinely produces epds  using generalized least squares accounting for the pair-wise ld among snps. we fit this model for the  <dig> snps  with the largest birth date variances corresponding to the 1-
π^=  <dig>  proportion of snps detected to be under strong selection in the bayescπ analysis of birth date. growth traits , milk, marbling and calving ease  had the largest adjusted coefficients of determination and relative selection intensities . however, the models for birth weight, docility, and yearling height were not significant . a multiple regression with all  <dig> traits fit jointly produced an adjusted r <dig> of  <dig> , which is only slightly  larger than the r <dig> for the weaning weight model. individual terms from the multiple regression are not reported due to multicollinearity between several traits.

finally, to elucidate the biological processes associated with the genes located in the genomic regions detected to be under selection, we analysed the gene ontology term enrichment for the annotated genes within these regions . from the gblup results, we queried  <dig>  genes within  <dig> kbp of the top ranked  <dig> snps for their birth date ases, and from the bayescπ results, we queried  <dig>  genes within  <dig> kbp of the top  <dig> snps. there were  <dig>  genes shared between the two lists, and this list of genes was also queried using the david bioinformatics tools. various biological processes appear to be under selection based on the intersection of the gblup and gensel results—notably cellular metabolic process, biosynthetic process, translation, protein folding, regionalization, ectoderm development, leukocyte mediated immunity, and striated muscle cell proliferation . the intersection of the gblup and gensel results also found olfactory transduction, antigen processing and presentation, and the adipocytokine signalling pathway to be enriched kegg pathways. in addition to these terms, cell proliferation, spermatogenesis, and organ growth were enriched gene ontology terms from the gblup results . developmental process, anatomical structure development, cellular response to stress, response to oxidative stress, positive regulation of lymphocyte activation, and limb morphogenesis were additional enriched gene ontology terms from the gensel results .

discussion
artificial selection has increased the weights at which cattle are marketed either at weaning or yearling ages  while simultaneously decreasing the incidence of assisted births , and the trends observed in our data set are very similar to those reported for the entire angus breed
 <cit> . larger birth weights and yearling heights are both strongly associated with increased calving difficulty and genetic trend increased both traits until about the mid-1980s, after which both began to decrease . breeders did not directly select to increase birth weight, but it increased as a correlated response to selection for increased weaning and yearling weights. some breeders selected for increased yearling height to produce angus cattle more comparable in frame size to the continental european breeds, which were imported into the us during the 1970s
 <cit> . however, once breeders appreciated the undesirable correlated response in calving ease, selection was practised to increase weaning and yearling weights while maintaining birth weight and yearling height constant.

using emmax, only eleven loci were found to be significantly associated with birth date and thus under strong selection, but all loci simultaneously explained 53% of the variation in birth date. on the other hand, bayescπ estimated that  <dig> % of the snps were strongly associated with birth date, but all snps explained 72% of the variance in birth date. the difference in the heritability estimates between the gblup or emmax analyses compared to the bayescπ analysis reflects the different model assumptions underlying these analyses. whereas gblup and emmax assume the infinitesimal model under which all snp ases are drawn from a distribution with constant variance
 <cit> , bayescπ begins with a distribution with constant variance but shrinks the variance for small effect snps that are rarely fit in the model. as a consequence, gblup and emmax regress all snp ases equally towards the mean of zero, while bayescπ more aggressively regresses small effect snps and less aggressively regresses large effect snps, leading to a better model fit—as was found here—when there are loci under very strong selection. in the absence of selection, genotype frequency should be independent of time provided that the effects of drift are negligible and the heritability estimates should be close to zero. however, this was not the case for us registered angus cattle and we conclude that a significant number of loci are rapidly responding to selection  and that most of the genome  is responding more slowly to selection. furthermore, in our nonlinear bayescπ model, 72% of the variation in birth date could be explained by simultaneously using all snp genotypes, suggesting that there are loci under very strong selection  that are not appropriately fit by the infinitesimal model.

the snp ases for the  <dig> analysed traits indicate that, with the exception of the two large effect qtls on bta  <dig> and  <dig>  the vast majority of qtls underlying quantitative traits in beef cattle are of small effect. of considerable interest, neither of these qtls was found to be under very strong selection and this seems to be because of their large antagonistic pleiotropic effects on growth and calving difficulty. we postulate that when multiple traits are simultaneously selected, the genetic architecture of the population defined by pleiotropy and the chromosomal organization of qtl alleles  constrains both the phenotypic and genotypic response to selection.

for selection to be effective, the selection intensity and effective population size must be sufficiently large to overcome the effects of genetic drift. we demonstrate that us registered angus cattle have a sufficiently large effective population size to enable successful artificial selection, but more importantly, that large intergenerational changes in allele frequency are unlikely to occur due to drift alone. furthermore, we found a considerable disparity between pedigree and genomic estimates of inbreeding coefficients. while others have argued that genomic relationship matrices should be adjusted to more closely resemble pedigree relationship matrices
 <cit> , we assert that genomic relationship matrices provide a more accurate representation of the realized relationships among individuals that result from the mendelian sampling of parental gametes and selection. the use of genomic relationship matrices in place of pedigree relationship matrices avoids the assumption of neutrality of loci both in the estimation of inbreeding coefficients and for the mean value of gametes inherited by progeny—both of which are assumed for the computation of the numerator relationship matrix
 <cit> . the disagreement between genomic and pedigree estimates of f coefficients is likely to be due to the assumption that base animals are not inbred, errors in the pedigrees, and missing pedigree information likely due to the large-scale importation of canadian angus cattle in the 1940s and 1950s that were not carriers of dwarfism alleles, which had been driven to high frequency due to selection at the time
 <cit> . this is supported by the closer agreement between pedigree and genomic f coefficients for the wye herd that was largely derived from british stock with more complete pedigree records than the remaining us registered angus cattle .

we attempted to identify the relative selection intensities placed on each selected trait via the imprints that multi-trait selection had left on the angus genome. although this analysis assumed no change in relative selection intensities in time, an assumption that is clearly violated in view of the genetic trends in birth weight and yearling height, we were able to confirm that growth traits have historically been the most strongly selected in us registered angus cattle. because angus is considered to be a maternal breed , it is logical that loci that influence calving ease, growth to weaning, and milking ability should have been found to be under selection. angus breeders have successfully selected to increase calving ease and body weight by selecting for body shapes that allow a calf’s easy passage through the dam’s pelvis. this is supported by the finding of an enrichment of gene ontology terms related to limb morphogenesis and anatomical structure development within regions of the genome detected as responding to selection. it has previously been shown that calving ease is negatively correlated with several body measures, such as head circumference, head width, hip width, hip height, chest girth, and cannon bone circumference
 <cit> . likely due to the certified angus beef’s emphasis on quality grade
 <cit> , angus breeders have more recently selected to increase marbling. conversely, traits such as fat thickness, docility, and heifer pregnancy rate have not been as intensely selected as growth traits, due to the differing breeding objectives of beef producers, genetic antagonisms constraining selection response, and the historic difficulty in collecting field data to allow the development of epds for these traits.

there is also evidence that natural selection has occurred in this population. the gene ontology enrichment results indicate that genes affecting immune response, such as the mhc, nod <dig>  c <dig>  and dbh, have strongly responded to selection , presumably due to the exposure of angus cattle to novel pathogens following their introduction into the us in 1873
 <cit>  and the continuous co-evolutionary “arms race” between bovine and pathogen genomes
 <cit> . the bovine hapmap consortium
 <cit>  found that the mhc had some of the lowest fst values in the entire genome when compared between breeds. our analyses have identified the mhc as being under strong selection. taken together, these results suggest that the mhc or certain of the numerous olfactory receptors which occupy the same region on chromosome  <dig> are under strong convergent selection.

furthermore, natural selection may also be attempting to buffer the cellular environment against the deleterious effects of inbreeding. we found that spermatogenesis was an enriched ontology term describing the function of genes within the strongly selected regions of the genome . seminal plasma proteins have been associated with bull fertility
 <cit> , and selection may be increasing fertility to counter act the inbreeding depression of reproduction . genes involved in response to oxidative stress were also identified; response to oxidative stress has been tied to mitigating inbreeding depression
 <cit> . we also inferred that at least  <dig> heat shock proteins are under selection in angus and that protein folding was an enriched biological process . it has been hypothesized that heat shock proteins assist the organism to cope with protein instability and misfolding caused by homozygous nonsynonymous mutations that are elevated in frequency by inbreeding
 <cit> .

one of the greatest difficulties encountered in identifying genomic signatures of selection is in distinguishing changes that have occurred due to demographic as opposed to selective forces
 <cit> . our birth date selection mapping approach utilizing mixed models specifically accounts for pedigree relationships and explicitly deconvolutes their confounding effects on time-dependent allele frequency changes, which are due to the fact that not all pedigrees are sampled equally deeply in terms of the numbers of genotyped individuals. rather than fit generations as the dependent variable
 <cit> , which are poorly estimated when pedigrees are incomplete, fitting birth date allows unknown or complex pedigrees with overlapping generations to be analysed. furthermore, the genomic relationship matrix accounts for pedigree relationships between samples, allowing closely related samples to be analysed. however, one of the limitations of birth date selection mapping is the requirement of a temporally stratified sample of genotyped individuals. the results for the analyses of the reduced data subsets suggest that sampling over extended time periods or large sample sizes—but not necessarily both—will be necessary to identify strongly selected loci. this will currently limit the utility of the approach in human populations due to a lack of preserved dna samples across multiple generations. however, this limitation may be alleviated as it becomes more practical to extract quality dna from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue section samples and ancient remains. nevertheless, birth date selection mapping is clearly most easily applied to organisms with temporally stratified dna samples and genome-wide genotypes.

using the estimated birth date ases as informative priors in the development of genomic selection programs
 <cit>  is another interesting application of our method. loci with small birth date ases are either of small effect on the selection objective or represent genes of large effect that have undesirable pleiotropic effects . loci that have large birth date ases must have large effects on the selection objective that are less constrained by antagonistic pleiotropic effects allowing them to more rapidly respond to selection.

CONCLUSIONS
when temporally stratified dna samples are available, birth date selection mapping is an effective method for the identification of strongly selected loci. we demonstrate that selection on polygenic traits leaves detectable signatures of selection throughout the genome at which small changes in allele frequencies per generation have occurred. if genes with large antagonistic pleiotropic effects exist, they respond to multi-trait selection as if they were of small effect on the breeding objective as predicted by quantitative genetic theory. by relating the detected signatures of selection to phenotype, we infer that artificial selection in us registered angus cattle has historically focussed primarily on growth and maternal traits including calving ease, weaning weight, and milking ability. this result was directly confirmed by the response to selection that has occurred in these traits that we directly estimated from epds provided by the aaa. finally, our results suggest that natural selection has also acted in this domesticated population to increase immunity and possibly to buffer the organism against the effects of inbreeding depression.
