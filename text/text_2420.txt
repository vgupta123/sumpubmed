BACKGROUND
white mold, caused by sclerotinia sclerotiorum  de bary, is a devastating disease of over  <dig> reported dicotyledonous hosts  <cit> . the disease causes economically significant losses of many crop plants including pea  under the appropriate environmental conditions  <cit> . currently, little is known about the genetic control of pathogenicity in the fungus and mechanisms of resistance in pea. although hundreds of pea cultivars have been screened for white mold resistance in replicated greenhouse and laboratory tests  <cit> , only partial resistance has been identified to date.

the identification of genes underlying s. sclerotiorum pathogenicity and resistance in pea would increase our knowledge of the pea-s. sclerotiorum interaction and facilitate the introgression of resistance into pea varieties. however, progress in these areas has been hampered by the lack of sequence information regarding the pea genome. although other legume genomes, including the models medicago truncatula, lotus japonicus and economically important glycine max  are available  <cit> , pisum sativum is still genome resource-poor in part due to the large genome size and large fraction of highly repetitive dna  <cit> .

the performance of next-generation sequencing  technologies continue to rise while costs continue to fall which enables researchers to conduct whole transcriptome sequencing  studies of interactions between plants and pathogenic fungi  <cit> . the application of ngs in plant-fungal interaction research promises to shorten the overall time of development of molecular genetic information necessary for functional and translational studies. however, rnaseq has rarely been used to study plant-pathogen interactions, particularly in non-model systems. one reason for this is the difficulty in distinguishing plant and fungal ests and even virus or viroid contamination, particularly when reference genomes are not available. here we report novel transcriptome sequence information from the pea-s. sclerotiorum interaction obtained by  <dig> pyrosequencing and propose a method of rapid and efficient transcriptome characterization in a non-model species with little prior molecular information. we also report on the development and validation of a strategy to distinguish plant and fungal ests using the tblastx program and “proxy-reference” genomes in the absence of true reference genomes.

RESULTS
contiguous est assembly
 <dig>  contigs were obtained by de novo assembly of  <dig>  high-quality reads produced on a roche  <dig> gs flx sequencer . minimum contig length was  <dig> bp, maximum length was  <dig>  bp and average length was  <dig> bp. average read coverage of contigs was  <dig> x, and the maximum read coverage was  <dig> x .
.

filter for virus or viroid contamination
the tblastx program identified  <dig> contigs with a blast hit  to virus or viroid dna with an e-value cutoff threshold of less than 1e- <dig>  further evaluation of these  <dig> est contigs with tblastx against  <dig> legume and  <dig> fungal genome databases  revealed that  <dig> contigs showed significant alignment with the proxy plant genome database,  <dig> showed significant alignment with the fungal genome database and  <dig> showed significant alignment with both databases,  <dig> contigs showed significant alignment only with virus genomes. by comparing the e-value ratio  of all proxy-reference genome alignments,  <dig> contigs were assigned to pea and  <dig> contigs were assigned to s. sclerotiorum based on an e-value ratio >1e <dig>   <dig> contigs were difficult to distinguish, with e-value ratios between 1e- <dig> and 1e <dig>  blastn analysis of the  <dig> unassigned contigs against pea and s. sclerotiorum ests from known sources revealed that  <dig> contigs, including the  <dig> that only aligned with virus genomes, had high identity matches to pea with 95% accuracy and 95% query coverage, and  <dig> to s. sclerotiorum. the  <dig> contigs which were difficult to assign to a genome database by either tblastx or blastn methods were far more similar to plant or fungi than to virus genomes.

development and testing a method to distinguish pea and s. sclerotiorum ests using an artificially mixed pool
pea and s. sclerotiorum ests were downloaded from genbank to test the tblastx sorting method. three hundred twenty-one ests with vector contamination and  <dig> ests highly similar to virus or viroids were removed from the total pool of  <dig>  known pea and s. sclerotiorum ests. using an e-value threshold of 1e- <dig>   <dig>  mixed ests from pea and s. sclerotiorum were compared to legume and fungal proxy-reference genome databases and parsed using the tblastx program .  <dig>  ests only aligned with the legume proxy-reference genomes,  <dig>  ests only aligned with the fungal proxy-reference genomes,  <dig>  ests similar to both plant and fungal proxy-reference genomes and  <dig>  ests did not match either proxy-reference genome database. the ests with tblastx results to both plant and fungal genomes were analyzed further by comparing the e-value ratio  of fungal and plant proxy-reference genome alignments.  <dig>  ests were assigned to pea based on an e-value ratio >1e <dig>   <dig>  ests were assigned to s. sclerotiorum based on an e-value ratio <1e- <dig>  while  <dig>  ests were difficult to distinguish due to high e-value alignments to both proxy-reference genome databases, with e-value ratios between 1e- <dig> and 1e <dig>  this method successfully separated  <dig> % of the known ests into pea or s. sclerotiorum categories, with only a  <dig> % misallocation rate. only  <dig> % of ests had zero similarity to either of the proxy-reference genomes, and  <dig> % of ests had high similarity to both the plant and fungal proxy-reference genome databases .
.

*to assess the potential of the tblastx method for the parsing of pea and s. sclerotiorum est contigs,  <dig>  and  <dig>  known s. sclerotiorum and pea ests from online databases were pooled, the ests were then parsed using the tblastx method. only  <dig> % of ests could not be assigned and only  <dig>  ests were mis-assigned to the wrong class .

parsing  <dig> pyrosequence pea and s. sclerotiorum ests with tblastx and blastn
initial tblastx parsing of  <dig>  contigs with an e-value threshold of 1e- <dig> resulted in identification of  <dig>  pea ests,  <dig>  s. sclerotiorum ests,  <dig>  ests that matched both pea and s. sclerotiorum, and  <dig>  ests that did not matched either proxy-reference genome database. the  <dig>  ests that matched both proxy-reference genomes at the e-value threshold of 1e- <dig> were further subdivided using the e-value ratio method into  <dig> pea ests , 355 s. sclerotiorum ests  and  <dig>  that were ambiguous . this brought the number of classified ests for each category to  <dig>  for pea,  <dig>  for s. sclerotiorum,  <dig>  as ambiguous with high matches to both proxy-reference genomes, and  <dig>  with no significant alignment. the remaining  <dig>  est contigs that were ambiguous or showed no significant alignment were further parsed with blastn analysis against known pea and s. sclerotiorum ests if identity and query coverage were both equal to or greater than 95%.  <dig>  ests of this pool were assigned with blastn to pea and  <dig> ests were assigned to s. sclerotiorum, leaving  <dig> ambiguous and  <dig> est contigs with no significant alignment. in total with tblastx and blastn,  <dig>  contigs were separated into  <dig>  pea ests,  <dig>  s. sclerotiorum ests,  <dig> ambiguous ests and  <dig> unassigned ests .

validation of tblastx and blastn est parsing results by pcr
validation of the tblastx and blastn assignment was performed for 50 s. sclerotiorum and  <dig> pea est contigs randomly sampled from the two assigned categories. all  <dig> primer sets designed to the pea est contigs amplified the expected amplicon size in both the pea-s. sclerotiorum and non-inoculated pea cdna indicating correct parsing assignment of the pea ests . of the  <dig> pcr primers designed to the s. sclerotiorum ests,  <dig> amplified a pcr product from both the pea-s. sclerotiorum and s. sclerotiorum only cdna samples and most of them amplified the same size amplicon in both cdna samples. two of the 50 s. sclerotiorum pcr primer pairs amplified the expected pcr products from the pea-s. sclerotiorum cdna sample but not the s. sclerotiorum only cdna, perhaps indicating that this transcript is only expressed during the interaction with pea. one s. sclerotiorum primer set failed to amplify any pcr product from either template.

unique ests expressed in the pea-s. sclerotiorum interaction
to detect unique genes expressed in our pea-s. sclerotiorum interaction, the  <dig>  classified pea ests in our data set were compared with blastn against  <dig>  recently published pea ests from flowers, leaves, cotyledons, epi- and hypocotyl, and etiolated and light treated etiolated seedlings  <cit> . of these  <dig>  ests,  <dig>  ests had significant alignments with an e-value cutoff of 1e- <dig>  in which  <dig>  contigs had a percentage identity threshold of 95% for 95% or more of the query sequence, leaving  <dig>  potentially unique pea ests to the pea-s. sclerotiorum interaction. it was possible to annotate  <dig>  of these ests of which  <dig> contigs encode transcription factors ,  <dig> were involved in signaling pathways  and  <dig> contigs were involved in encoding defense-associated proteins .

the  <dig>  s. sclerotiorum est contigs were also assessed with blastn against  <dig>  s. sclerotiorum ests . of these,  <dig>  ests matched with an e-value cutoff of 1e- <dig>  in which  <dig> ests matched with 95% identity for 95% of more of the query length to the s. sclerotiorum est growth libraries. of the remaining  <dig> unique ests, it was possible to annotate  <dig> ests of which  <dig> ests were described as being related to pathogen virulence or pathogenicity .

prediction of secretory/signal peptides for the s. sclerotiorum contigs
a total of  <dig>  coding regions were predicted with orfpredictor from the set of  <dig>  s. sclerotiorum ests. the peptide sequences were then used as a query for signalp  <dig> , which predicts the presence and location of signal peptide cleavage sites in amino acid sequences and identifies them as secretory proteins. the neural network  method predicted  <dig> secretory signals, and the hidden markov model  predicted  <dig>  a total of  <dig> ests were identified by both nn and hmm and can be considered putative secretory peptides with high confidence . of these  <dig> predicted secretory proteins,  <dig> were reported to be involved in pathogen virulence or pathogenicity .

discussion
significance of study and summary of the main findings
despite pisum sativum being used by gregor mendel to propose a model of particulate inheritance and being a highly nutritious food source for populations worldwide, few genomic resources exist for pea. one of the pathogens of pea, s. sclerotiorum is not only capable of causing devastating disease of pea but is able to infect over  <dig> plant species  <cit> . by sequencing a normalized cdna pool of the pea-s. sclerotiorum interaction with next generation sequencing we have catalogued a number of novel genes putatively involved in pathogenicity and resistance. to our knowledge this is the first study to examine the pea-s. sclerotiorum “interactome”. sequencing the transcriptome  is the method of choice in non-model systems for transcript discovery and genome annotation  <cit> . however, it has rarely been used to study plant-fungal interactions; one reason for this is the difficulty in distinguishing plant and fungal ests, particularly when reference genomes are not available. using genomes of closely related species and tblastx to parse pea and s. sclerotiorum ests we demonstrated that roche 454-pyrosequencing is a useful technique to characterize the host-pathogen interactome when genome resources are limited.

tblastx parsing method
two different strategies have been utilized previously to identify transcript origins in mixed plant and fungal est datasets. one is a predictive method based on triplet nucleotide usage frequencies  <cit>  and the other is a homology method using the blastp algorithm  <cit> . one shortcoming of the blastp method is that it could not be applied to novel genes or sequences from the non-coding regions of genes. although the triplet nucleotide frequency method extends the application of the algorithm to both coding and non-coding sequences, the classification accuracy is approximately 90%, and required the use of a training set of ests to develop the nucleotide frequency for separation. a combined method was also used by fernandez et al.  <cit> , although this method distinguished 91% of the ests from the coffea arabicahemileia vastatrix interaction no validation of the method was presented  <cit> .

classification of genes from a pool of mixed cdna by traditional sequence similarity analysis  is of interest to many investigations into plant-pathogen interactions. dna sequencing is becoming more affordable and whole genome sequences of many organisms are becoming available and will aid in plant-pathogen interaction studies. however, in pea these resources are not available, therefore, we used a standalone blast approach against proxy-reference genome databases with high genetic similarity to pea or s. sclerotiorum to distinguish mixed transcripts. using an artificial mixture of known pea and sclerotinia ests, we found the error rate using the blast method was significantly lower than the triplet nucleotide frequencies method . we also demonstrated that the tblastx algorithm provided improved sorting of contigs relative to the blastn algorithm, and results in fewer ambiguous reads . in addition, although one individual genome of s. sclerotiorum  has been sequenced  <cit> , there are still  <dig>  mb of predicted gaps in the  <dig>  mb assembly. to avoid ignoring unique genes between two different strains of the same species, a multi-fungal genome approach was adopted in this study. it was demonstrated that the assignment error rate based on  <dig> closely related fungal genomes was slightly decreased relative to assignment based on the single s. sclerotiorum genome . the e-value and e-value ratio utilized in our study to differentiate pea and s. sclerotiorum reads chosen selected after comparing several e-values, to maximize discrimination while reducing the error rate . additionally, we determined error rates for this method using the artificial est mix and validated the technique using our est data set. we found that the percentage of unassigned ests  in the  <dig> data set was higher than in the test est data set . one hypothesis to explain this difference is the average sequence length in the  <dig> data  was shorter than known pea  or sclerotinia ests  used in test data, which may result in no significant alignment against the proxy-reference plant or fungal genome databases, particularly when non-coding mrna is considered. the remaining unassigned est contigs  were parsed using blastn searches against known pea and s. sclerotiorum ests, which assigned  <dig> % of the unassigned contigs. using this combined tblastx and blastn approach  <dig> % of the  <dig>  contigs were identified as pea  or s. sclerotiorum est . additionally, the est parsing method was validated by pcr demonstrating that the parsing method was able to correctly assign ests from the  <dig> data set with a low error rate.

pea ests unique to the pea-s. sclerotiorum interaction
in response to pathogen attack, plants have evolved complex signaling and defense pathways. putatively unique ests in our pea-s. sclerotiorum interactome were defined and identified by comparing est contigs in our library against those of non-interaction est libraries of pea and s. sclerotiorum. although we identified a total of  <dig>   putatively unique pea ests it was only possible to annotate  <dig>  of these and only  <dig> had annotations suggesting roles in defense or response to biotic and abiotic stress. most of the annotated genes are consistent with previous expression profiling analyses in brassica napus infected with sclerotinia sclerotiorum <cit> . following infection, many genes, including those encoding defense-associated proteins, enzymes involved in signaling pathways, and genes encoding transcription factors were induced.

transcriptional control of the expression of stress-responsive genes is a crucial part of plant response to a range of abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> . we demonstrated that  <dig> putative transcription factors were detected. these genes were classified into the myb family, the apetala2/ethylene responsive element binding protein  family, wrky family and others . seven myb family transcription factors were detected in our data and they play a key role in hormone signal transduction and disease resistance  <cit> . eight ap2/erebp transcription factors, including  <dig> ethylene insensitive transcription factors  and  <dig> ap2/erf genes , are key regulatory elements for ethylene signaling and response for biotic or abiotic stresses  <cit> .wrky <dig> act as negative regulators of defense signaling and have been associated with negatively regulating resistance to p. syringae in arabidopsis  <cit> .

plant defenses are regulated through a complex network of transduction pathways  <cit> . sixty-nine unique pea ests involved in signaling pathways were detected in this study. the signaling pathways were mediated by different signaling molecules, like abscisic acid , auxin, brassinosteroid, calcium ion, ethylene , gibberellic acid , jasmonic acid , salicylic acid  and small gtpase . those results were consistent with previous studies of signaling pathways involved in plant resistance to sclerotinia sclerotiorum <cit> .

expression of downstream proteins, including defense-associated proteins, was induced through signal transduction and transcription factor regulation after pathogen infection. in this study,  <dig> unique pea ests encoding defense related proteins were detected . four contigs , encoding putative pathogenesis-related  proteins involved in the response to pathogen attack were prominent. numbers of cell-wall-related genes were also detected; those contigs involved in the biosynthesis of plant cell wall structures and the disassembly of fungal cell walls. chitinase , beta- <dig>  3-glucanase  and other glycoside hydrolases are known to possess anti-fungal activity by degrading fungal cell walls  <cit> .

s. sclerotiorum ests unique to the pea-s. sclerotiorum interaction
pathogens have evolved a number of strategies to gain entry into the host cell and to overcome the plant defense system. in this study, we identified 996 s. sclerotiorum contigs as specifically expressed during pea-s. sclerotiorum interaction through comparison of est contigs against s. sclerotiorum ests from growth libraries. ninety-five of  <dig> annotated contigs were described as being involved in pathogen virulence or pathogenicity .

fungi produce enzymes that degrade the cell wall and wall-associated polymers to penetrate plant cells. there were  <dig> specifically expressed contigs involved in the penetration of the plant cuticle and cell wall. contig  <dig> encodes an exoglucanase  <dig> precursor, which has cellulolytic activity  <cit>  and is involved in cellulose degradation; enzymes encoded by  <dig> contigs  are involved in hemicellulose degradation; enzymes encoded by  <dig> contigs  are involved with pectin degradation. in addition, carbohydrate esterase encoded by contig  <dig> was also involved in plant polysaccharide degradation. integrity of the fungal cell wall is also very important for pathogenesis and some reports showed the deletion of biosynthetic cell wall enzymes resulted in dramatically reduced virulence  <cit> . in our data,  <dig> contigs were identified as affecting biosynthesis and integrity of fungal cell walls. enzymes encoded by contigs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were involved in chitin synthesis; contigs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were involved in glucan synthesis; and  <dig> contigs  were involved in mannan synthesis.

sclerotinia sclerotiorum differentiates appressoria into infection cushions prior to invasion and we found  <dig> genes involved in the formation of infection structures. eight contigs were involved in response to the host immune system, of which  <dig> efflux transporters encoded by contigs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are responsible not only for export of compounds involved in pathogenesis such as secondary metabolites, but also export of host-derived antimicrobial compounds  <cit> . contig  <dig> had similarity to the guanine nucleotide-binding protein  alpha subunit which is an important signal transducing molecule in cells, essential for growth, asexual and sexual development, and virulence in both animal and plant pathogenic filamentous fungal species  <cit> . importin beta- <dig> encoded by contig  <dig> belongs to the importin β family which mediates transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm of macromolecules that contain nuclear import or export signals. all importin β members have the ability to recognize and bind specific cargo involved in the recognition of the host and signaling  <cit> .

secreted/signaling proteins
proteins secreted by fungi play a key role in the development of plant disease and the evolution of pathogenicity  <cit> . some secreted proteins can degrade polymers encountered, such as cellulose, lipid, protein, and lignin, and transport the resulting simple sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids into the growing cell for use  <cit> . using the signalp <dig>  program with stringent criteria,  <dig> contigs encoding putative secreted proteins were identified in the  <dig>  s. sclerotiorum contigs. twenty-one of the  <dig> annotated contigs were described as involved in pathogen virulence/pathogenicity in previous research . contig  <dig> encodes an enolase which is usually present on the cell surface or even secreted and is a potential virulence factor. in bacterial systems enolase has been demonstrated to contribute to pathogenicity by binding plasminogen in the infected host, potentially allowing the bacteria to acquire surface-associated proteolytic activity  <cit> . the basic leucine zipper transcription factor, encoded by contig  <dig>  is a member of the bzip family, one bzip family member  from the rice fungus magnaporthe oryzae mediates oxidative stress responses and is necessary for full virulence  <cit> . contig  <dig> encoding fkbp-type peptidylprolyl isomerase, with high homology to the mip  protein, has been shown to be an essential virulence factor in legionella pneumophila <cit> . chitin synthase  <dig>  plays a major role in cell wall biogenesis. disruption of botrytis cinerea class i chitin synthase gene bcchs <dig> results in cell wall weakening and reduced virulence  <cit> . autophagy is necessary for turnover of organic matter during the formation of conidia and appressoria and for normal development and pathogenicity in magnaporthe grisea. autophagy is required for the virulence of some eukaryotic pathogens  <cit> . contig  <dig> encodes endo-β- <dig>  xylanase which plays a significant role in the virulence of magnaporthe oryzae, affects both penetration and expansion of m. oryzae in infected plants  <cit> . pectin methylesterase  produced by phytopathogenic bacteria and fungi catalyses the demethoxylation of pectin, a major plant cell wall polysaccharide  <cit> . the possible role of secreted adenylate kinase , encoded by contig  <dig>  as a virulence factor is in producing and keeping an intact pool of toxic mixtures of amp, adp, and atp, which allows pseudomonas aeruginosa to exert its full virulence  <cit> . glutathione reductase is important to nitric oxide and macrophage resistance and is essential for virulence  <cit>  and in candida albicans grx <dig>  a putative glutaredoxin, is required for virulence in a murine model  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
here we present an est resource that is specific for the pea-s. sclerotiorum interaction. we demonstrate and validate a method to reliably parse host and pathogen ests without the need for reference genomes. the ests were compared to non-interaction est libraries to identify candidate resistance and pathogenicity genes. we also catalogued  <dig> proteins putatively secreted by s. sclerotiorum. the est dataset will be a useful reference for further plant-fungus interaction studies, particularly for the sclerotinia and legume research communities. additionally, the s. sclerotiorum ests will be a valuable resource for the annotation of the s. sclerotiorum genome. although the depth of our sequencing was not sufficient to obtain a global view of transcripts expressed during the pea-s. sclerotiorum interaction, the results are still very useful for the identification of plant resistance, fungal pathogenicity and virulence genes. this study sets the ground work and will be a resource for our current pea-s. sclerotiorum rnaseq expression profiling studies.
