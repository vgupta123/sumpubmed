BACKGROUND
the innate immune response is important in the early stages of defense against bacterial or viral pathogens, and also for an efficient adaptive immune response  <cit> . toll-like receptors  play a central role in the innate immune response. they recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns , such as lipopolysaccharides , lipopeptides, flagellins, dsrna or cpg dna motifs. pamps are specific for bacteria, viruses and protozoan parasites  <cit> . the human genome contains  <dig> different tlrs, and  <dig> mouse tlrs have been identified. tlrs are type  <dig> transmembrane proteins, with a large extracellular domain composed of up to  <dig> leucine-rich repeats  flanked by n-terminal and c-terminal cap motifs, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic toll/interleukin- <dig> receptor  domain. lrrs are motifs of 20– <dig> amino acids in length that fold into a horseshoe shape  <cit> . they occur in many different proteins and appear to provide a structural framework for the formation of protein-protein interactions  <cit> . in tlrs, the lrr motifs are involved in recognition of pamps and in hetero- or homo-dimerization. the tir domain is highly conserved and interacts with adapter proteins such as myd <dig> and tirap   <cit> . ligand binding induces homo- or hetero-dimerization of tlrs, and subsequent recruitment of intracellular adapter proteins. via intermediates such as traf <dig>  irak family proteins and ik-kinase family proteins, map-kinase signaling cascades and transcription factors including nf-kb family proteins are activated, which leads to increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules.

six major tlr families have been identified in vertebrates; each tlr family recognizes one class of pamps  <cit> . members of the tlr <dig> family, which include tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  recognize lipopeptides, components of the cell wall of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the unique particularity of this family is that tlr <dig> forms heterodimers with tlr <dig> or tlr <dig>  these heterodimers recognize distinct molecular patterns of lipopeptides  <cit>  and by exchanging domains between tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> the functional importance of lrr9- <dig>  for discrimination between di-acyl and tri-acyl lipopeptides, was established  <cit> .

phylogenetic and chromosomal analysis suggests that tlr <dig> and a tlr1-like gene diverged from an ancestral gene early in vertebrate evolution  <cit> . the mammalian genes for tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> are located consecutively on the same chromosome  and oriented in the same direction at intergenic distances of only  <dig> to  <dig> kilobases  <cit> . they result from successive tandem gene duplications of an ancestral gene that first gave rise to a tlr <dig> gene and a tlr1-like gene. subsequent duplication of the tlr1-like gene resulted in the emergence of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  <cit> . the absence of separate tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> genes in the opossum and the platypus suggests that these paralogs arose by gene duplication after the divergence of placental mammals  and marsupials , and before the radiation of the eutherians  .

a previous report suggested the presence of coincidental evolution within the tlr <dig> family  <cit> . furthermore, two recent studies showed that overall tir domain sequences of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> paralogs from three mammalian species clustered together, whereas the amino-terminal part of tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> clustered with their respective orthologs  <cit> . to better analyze this phenomenon, we compared the amino acid and dna sequences of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> in nine mammalian species to identify conserved regions that may be important for their functional activities. we found that sequences of the n-terminal domains, and the extreme c-terminal regions, are in agreement with divergence of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> in a common ancestor of modern mammalian lineages. in contrast, for a  <dig> amino acid intervening sequence, paralogs in the same species were more similar than ortholog sequences between species, due to gene conversion events that occurred independently at the same positions in the ancestors of the mammals analyzed. this is a striking example of where gene conversion has enabled conservation of functional features of paralogs while other domains have evolved novel roles.

RESULTS
alignment of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> protein sequences
conservation of amino acid sequence may reflect functional constraints on the evolution of proteins. as tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> both interact with lipopeptides, with tlr <dig> and with intracellular signal transducers such functional constraints are likely to be important in the evolution of these tlrs. here, we conducted a search for conserved amino acids in tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  which may help to identify functionally important sequences. we aligned the amino acid sequences of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> from nine mammalian species . the complete alignment of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> protein sequences, as well as the domain structure of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  is given . overall, the average percentage identity for pairwise comparisons between sequences from the nine species was  <dig>  ±  <dig>   % for tlr <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for tlr <dig>  a close inspection of the sequence alignments revealed three patterns of sequence identity. in one pattern, an amino acid at a particular position of tlr <dig> was conserved among the orthologs and different from the amino acid at the same position in tlr <dig>  and vice versa. in an alternative pattern, tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> from one species had the same amino acid, which was not necessarily conserved in other species at the same position. visual inspection of the sequences revealed an abrupt transition from the first pattern to the second pattern in a region close to amino acid  <dig>  and a reversal to the first pattern near amino acid  <dig> , pan troglodytes , macaca mulatta , mus musculus , rattus norvegicus , erinaceus europaeus , bos taurus , sus scrofa  and canis familiaris . amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> are included as they include the junction sites of three patterns of sequence similarity. the three patterns of identity observed at a particular position are: a) ortholog sequences are more identical; b) paralog sequences are more identical; c) a high over all sequence identity. color codes: pattern a) in light blue : the same amino acid is conserved in  <dig> or more of  <dig> ortholog tlr <dig>  sequences and present in two or less tlr <dig>  sequences. pattern b) in red, green, dark blue or grey: the sequences of the tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> paralogs are identical in at least seven species; these paralog pairs do not all have the same amino acid at this position. pattern c) in yellow: the same amino acid is conserved in  <dig> or more of the  <dig> tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> sequences, patterns a or b do not apply. for the same analysis for the full length tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> proteins .

to determine whether these patterns were significant, we made a pairwise analysis for percentage sequence identity of the tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> sequences from one primate species , one rodent species  and from hedgehog, cow, swine and dog. for the full length molecules, and for the regions 1– <dig> and 746-end, we observed that the average percentage sequence identity of the orthologous tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> sequences was significantly higher  than the average percentage sequence identity of the paralogous tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> sequence of the same species, whereas the reverse was true for the region 437– <dig>  .

analysis for gene conversion
to determine if the results for the region 437– <dig> could have been due to gene conversion, we created phylogenetic trees using dna sequences encoding the full-length molecules and the different regions of sequence pattern described above ; similar trees were observed when protein sequences were used . phylogenetic trees for dna sequences encoding full length tlr <dig> or tlr <dig>  as well as amino acid region 1– <dig> were concordant with a model in which tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> independently evolved from a common tlr1-like ancestor. the tree structure was compatible with the known evolutionary relationships among the mammalian species.

by contrast, for the dna region encoding amino acids 437– <dig>  the phylogenetic trees implied dna transfer from tlr <dig> to tlr <dig>  by gene conversion independently occurring in the common ancestor of the primates and in the other six mammalian species . a closer analysis of the primate sequences gave some evidence for a gene conversion event occurring in this region after divergence of rhesus monkeys and the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans, but branch lengths are too short to give reliable results. for the dna region encoding amino acids 746-end, no clear phylogenetic relationships could be established. the rodent, dog and primate sequences of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> clustered separately, whereas the cow, pig and hedgehog sequences of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> clustered together . the phylogenetic tree for the first  <dig> bp of the 3' non-translated region was similar to that of the region encoding amino acid 1– <dig> . taken together, these data are compatible with independent gene conversion events starting in a region near the codon of amino acid  <dig> and ending, in all mammals, between the codon for amino acid  <dig> and the stop codon.

to further establish whether gene conversion has occurred, and identify the boundaries for each species, we made an analysis using the geneconv program  <cit>  . as gene conversion between the tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> gene can only occur during meiotic division in the ancestor of a species, and not between species, we made a pairwise comparison of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> sequences within each species. the results were highly significant . the inferred boundaries for gene conversion started between nucleotide  <dig> and  <dig>  which are within  <dig> bp downstream of the nucleotide position  <dig> that was inferred by visual inspection of the protein sequences. for seven mammalian species the inferred 3' boundaries were situated between nucleotide  <dig> and  <dig>  which is within  <dig> bp upstream of position  <dig>  inferred from the protein sequences. the inferred ends for the gene conversion fragments were  <dig> for the cow tlr1/tlr <dig> sequences and  <dig> for the pig sequences .

bc ka p-values are bonferroni-corrected karlin-altschul  <cit>  p-values; the position of similar fragments is given with respect to the aligned human tlr <dig> dna sequence . "num poly" is the number of polymorphic sites in the fragment. "num dif" is the number of mismatches within the fragment.

to further discriminate whether the results described were due to gene conversion rather than convergent evolution we performed an analysis of codon usage for the conserved amino acids. indeed, amino acid sequences that remained invariant through evolution or became identical through convergent evolution are less likely to be encoded by the same triplets than sequences that became identical after gene conversion. overall the tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> paralogs share 66% amino acid identity . analysis of codon usage for conserved amino acids in tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> showed that on average identical codons were significantly  more frequently used to encode conserved amino acids in the region  <dig> to  <dig>  than in the regions encoding amino acids 1– <dig>  or  <dig> to end  

for three regions of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  we determined, for all conserved amino acids, whether the codon used in tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> was identical or synonymous. the results are expressed as identical/ × 100%. n : gives the number of conserved amino acids on which the averages were calculated.

* the percentage identical codon usage for conserved amino acids for the region 437– <dig> was significantly higher than for the regions 1– <dig> and 745-end.

tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> share a common locus . we investigated whether there was evidence for gene conversion between the genes for tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> or tlr <dig>  apart from a small region around nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig>  in only the bos taurus and sus scrofa sequences, which is ancestral to the gene conversion events between tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> in these species, no evidence for gene conversion was observed .

tlr <dig> and tlr  <dig> share a common locus on the x-chromosome. we analyzed these genes, but observed no evidence for gene conversion .

discussion
by comparing the ortholog and paralog protein sequences from a large number of species, functionally important sequences may be identified. here, we made a comparative analysis of protein and coding dna sequences of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> from nine mammalian species, representing the mammalian orders primates, rodentia, insectivora, artiodactyla and carnivora. at the time of writing this article no complete sequence information for tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> was available for mammals representing other mammalian orders. we identified a  <dig> amino acid stretch near the c-terminal end of the proteins in which tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> from the same species were on average more than 96% identical, whereas orthologs of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> were only 80% identical in this region . our analyses show that the high degree of sequence identity between tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> from the same species is due to gene conversion that had independently occurred in six mammalian species and in an ancestor of three primates. our data confirm and extend results of recent phylogenetic analyses showing that overall tir domain sequences of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> paralogs from three mammalian species clustered together, whereas the amino-terminal part of tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> or tir domain sequences of other tlr genes clustered with their respective orthologs  <cit> . our results show that the same applies not only for tir domains of representatives of several other mammalian orders, but also that the boundaries for gene conversion are located at highly conserved positions. the region homogenized by gene conversion corresponds to the last four lrr motifs, the c-terminal cap, the transmembrane domain and three quarters of the tir domain. we have no clear explanation as to why the boundaries of gene conversion are so highly conserved in most of the species. one explanation might be that the segments that were the subject of gene conversion lie directly adjacent to the segments that have tlr1- or tlr6-specific functions. alternatively, the genes of both tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> might contain short conserved dna segments that are particularly prone to gene conversion; co-evolution with common binding partners of tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> would then result in the preferential selection of the optimal intervening sequence.

gene conversion is a common event in evolution and is a powerful means to restrain the divergence of paralog sequences. it appears to be favored when paralogs are located on the same chromosome at distances of less than  <dig> kb  <cit> , as is the case for tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  gene duplication and gene conversion in six mammalian species have shaped the paired immunoglobulin-like receptor  locus, which encodes regulators of the innate and adaptive immune systems with pilra being an inhibitory receptor, and pilrb, its activating counterpart  <cit> . in a striking example of concerted evolution, emr <dig>  a member of the epidermal growth factor tm <dig> family, possesses a chimeric structure with a seven-span transmembrane region most related to emr <dig> and an egf domain region nearly identical to cd <dig>  the chimeric structure of emr <dig> has been continuously maintained since early mammalian radiation by gene conversion events between different regions of the emr <dig> gene and the oppositely orientated and physically adjacent genes cd <dig> and emr <dig>  <cit> .

we may postulate that the unusual conservation of sequence identity for the region  <dig> to  <dig> of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  in all nine mammalian species for which complete sequence information is available, reflects strong selective mechanisms that restrained divergence of this region. however, in view of the conserved gene conversion boundaries, restriction of high sequence identity to the region 436– <dig> allowed  independent evolution of the n-terminal region and extreme c-terminal region of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  information on the function of the various domains of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> has become available in recent years and may support this postulate. heterodimers of tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> with tlr <dig> mediate cell activation in response to a large number of diacyl and triacyl ligands. gene duplication of the ancestor of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> enabled divergence between the two receptors leading to an increase in the repertoire of lipopeptides that can be recognized by tlr <dig> heterodimers. transfection of human embryonic kidney cells for expression of tlr <dig> or tlr <dig>  in combination with tlr <dig> and cd <dig>  made cells responsive to tri- and di-acylated lipopeptides, respectively  <cit> . examination of chimeric receptors, generated by domain exchange between tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> revealed that lrr9- <dig> enables these receptors to discriminate between tri- and di-acylated lipopeptides  <cit> . the greater sequence identity of the tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> orthologs, and lower sequence identity of the paralogs in these domains, is in accordance with a preservation of lipopeptide discrimination potential during mammalian evolution.

the higher sequence identity of tlr1/ <dig> paralogs for the amino acid region  <dig> to  <dig>  generated by gene conversion, might reflect the need for tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> to co-evolve with common binding partners, in such a way that functional interaction surfaces are maintained. analysis by fluorescence resonance energy transfer has shown that tlr1/tlr <dig> and tlr6/tlr <dig> heterodimers are present at the cell surface even in the absence of lipopeptide ligands  <cit> . it is therefore likely that tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> have at least to co-evolve with tlr <dig> to maintain a functional extracellular dimer interaction site. the localization of the interaction site may be inferred from the crystal structure of tlr <dig>  which revealed homodimer formation with the dimer interface located in the c-terminal lrr motifs  <cit> , a region corresponding to the n-terminal end of the conserved tlr1/tlr <dig> paralog region we describe. to what extent these dimer interfaces of tlr <dig> may be relevant for tlr2-mediated signaling remains to be established, because the formation of the tlr <dig> dimer structure might be a transient or forced encounter and therefore of questionable biological significance .

the contrasting requirement for diversity of ligand binding sites located in lrr9- <dig> that need to respond to evolutionary pressure from pathogens and co-evolution of dimer interaction sites in the c-terminal lrr motifs, is in agreement with the location in lrr <dig> of the gene conversion start sites. our finding that in all species gene conversion starts in an almost identical position  suggests that the lrr13- <dig> region is also important for ligand recognition and discrimination. in this context it is interesting to note that the dsrna binding site in tlr <dig> is located at amino acids h <dig> and n <dig>  <cit> . in an alignment with tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  these amino acids are located immediately prior to the common start position for gene conversion between tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> 

other putative extracellular binding partners with which tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> might need to co-evolve are cd <dig>  <cit>  and cd <dig>  <cit> . these proteins are associated with the tlr1/tlr <dig> and tlr6/tlr <dig> heterodimers when tlr ligands are present  <cit> . cd <dig> and cd <dig> are able to bind triacylated and diacylated lipopeptides and appear to serve as "sensors" or scavenger receptors to present the lipopeptides to tlr <dig> heterodimers  <cit> . however, direct binding of cd <dig> to tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> could not be detected  <cit> .

known or putative binding partners for the intracellular tir domains of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> are the tir domains of tlr <dig>  myd <dig> and tirap  <cit> . the need to co-evolve with these functional binding partners may explain the extension of the preserved gene conversion sequence to the intracellular region. recently, specific information has become available on the interactions between the tir domains of tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> and intracellular binding partners. site-directed mutagenesis and computer-based docking studies of the tir domains of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> revealed an interaction between gly- <dig>  of the tlr <dig> bb loop with residues arg- <dig> and phe- <dig> of the tlr <dig> dd loop  <cit> . at this position tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> are identical in all species. it is interesting to note that at two other interaction sites orthologs are almost identical to each other and different from their paralogs. one of these interaction sites, which lies within the region homogenized by gene conversion, corresponds to his- <dig> in tlr <dig> . the backbone nh of his- <dig> of tlr <dig> is predicted to form an intramolecular h-bond with the side chain of asn- <dig>  maintaining their tertiary structure in the tlr1/ <dig> complex  <cit> . in addition, asn- <dig> interacts with asp- <dig> in tlr <dig> and an electrostatic interaction is predicted for side chains of tlr <dig> his- <dig> and tlr <dig> asp- <dig>  next to his- <dig>  at residue  <dig> , in eight out of nine species analyzed, tlr <dig> has a glycine, whereas all tlr <dig> sequences have glutamic acid. this suggests that selective mechanisms have maintained  these distinct amino acids within the region of gene conversion. a third tlr1-tlr <dig> interaction site contains tyr- <dig> of tlr <dig> , which for most mammals lies exactly at the 3' end of the region homogenized by gene conversion. here all  <dig> tlr <dig> sequences analyzed have a tyrosine, while all tlr <dig> sequences have an asparagine. the observation that, for two out of three interaction sites, orthologous amino acids are identical and different from their paralogs, implies the existence of subtle structural differences between the tir domain heterodimers of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> with tlr <dig> that were maintained despite gene conversion events in their vicinity. to what extent this translates into functional differences between tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> remains to be established.

a common binding partner of tlr-tir domains is myd <dig>  recent results suggest that the tlr2-tir domain can bind myd <dig>  whereas the tlr1-tir and tlr6-tir domains do not  <cit> . however, mutation of one tlr <dig> amino acid from asn- <dig> to asp  enables tlr <dig> to bind myd <dig>  suggesting that these two proteins have almost complementary surfaces. it remains to be established whether, in the context of lipopeptide-activated cells, myd <dig> has the ability to bind tlr <dig>  a second important molecule for signaling through tlr1/tlr <dig>  tlr6/tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> is tirap, a sorting adapter molecule which facilitates myd <dig> recruitment to the plasma membrane  <cit> . presently, no information is available on direct binding of tirap to tlr <dig> or tlr <dig>  additional intracellular tlr binding proteins are heat shock protein  <dig> and the rna helicase ddx <dig> , which bind the tir domain of tlr <dig>  and heat shock protein  <dig>  which binds tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  <cit> . the interaction sites between these proteins and tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> are not yet determined. taken together, the large number of common binding partners places severe co-evolutionary constraints on the tir domains of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  which may explain the occurrence of gene conversion events in this region. however, these constraints do not explain why the 3' ends of the gene conversion region lies within  <dig> bp of each other for  <dig> out of  <dig> analyzed mammalian species, and why for the region downstream of this site the tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> orthologs are again more similar to each other than to their respective paralogs. from the crystal structure of the tir domain of tlr <dig>  <cit>  we may conclude that the corresponding amino acids  all lie in one plane at the surface of the tir domain . an intriguing possibility would be that tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> each interact with a different intracellular binding partner – either one of those mentioned above or originated by duplication of an ancestral binding partner of the tlr1/tlr <dig> ancestor – which might mediate intracellular responses that are specific for tlr <dig> or tlr <dig>  however, the existence of such hypothetical intracellular tlr1- or tlr6-specific binding partners remains to be established.

the c-terminal cap motif and the transmembrane domain of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> also show higher paralog than ortholog sequence identity. this either implies a requirement for co-evolution with as yet unknown binding partners for these regions, or that the selective mechanisms operating on lrr16- <dig> and the tir domain stimulate gene conversion events that drag the intervening c-terminal cap and transmembrane sequences along.

tlr <dig> shares a common locus with tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  it is an orphan receptor that can form homodimers and heterodimers with tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  has a tir domain that is functionally active and uses myd <dig> as an adapter molecule  <cit> . studies on the in vivo role of tlr <dig> are hampered by the fact that in mice tlr <dig> is a nonfunctional pseudogene. we investigated whether gene conversion had occurred between tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> or tlr <dig>  but found no evidence for gene conversion except for a very small region in the genomes of bos taurus and sus scrofa, which is ancestral to the gene conversion events between tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> in these species. the absence of consistent gene conversion between tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> is most likely due to the more recent divergence of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> from a common ancestor, as reflected by the phylogenetic trees and the higher sequence identity between tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  as compared to that between tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> . furthermore, the common binding partners of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  which drive the coevolution of these proteins, may not be the same as the binding partners of tlr <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the results reported here show that the paralogous mammalian tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> genes have a conserved region of extremely high sequence identity that has been maintained by gene conversion. this implies that gene conversion was a common and useful evolutionary mechanism for these tlrs. our findings show that protein paralogs with multiple functional domains can maintain common characteristics for specific domains by gene conversion, while allowing other domains to evolve diversified functions. given the large number of paralogs that are present in a mammalian genome, and the common occurrence of multiprotein complexes, it is to be expected that similar examples of gene conversion will be discovered. by recognizing sequences maintained by gene conversion, through careful phylogenetic analysis of these genomes in several mammalian species, it may be possible to identify novel protein-protein interaction sites and functionally important protein sub-structures.
