BACKGROUND
trichomes, developed from the protodermal cells , are hair-like structures covering the aerial parts of plants such as leaves, stems, petioles, sepals, petals, ovaries, fruits and seeds. trichomes are very diverse in shape, size, structure, location, capability to secrete, and functions. trichomes may play important roles in protecting plants from environmental stresses such as heat, low temperature, high uv, and insect herbivory  <cit> . seed trichomes may facilitate seed dispersal. for some specialty crops, such as cucumber , the presence or absence of trichomes constitutes an important quality issue for the end product.

for convenience, trichomes are often classified as glandular or non-glandular, unicellular or multicellular, and branched or unbranched. the unicellular, non-glandular trichome of arabidopsis thaliana has been used as a model system to study the molecular genetic mechanisms of trichome organogenesis, which involves a transcriptional network consisting of three groups of transcription factors: r2r <dig> mybs, the basic helix-loop-helix  factors and the wd <dig> repeat  proteins . among various components in this network, one class of transcription factors , the homeodomain leucine-zipper proteins , are important players in trichome initiation and development. based on the domain structures and associated functions, the hd-zip proteins are grouped into four classes  which share the conserved hd and zip domains that are responsible for dna binding and protein-protein interactions, respectively  <cit> . classes iii and iv proteins contain two additional domains, a steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer  domain hypothesized to bind sterols and lipids and a sad  with unknown functions  <cit> . the class iv hd-zip tfs seem to play critical roles in regulating the differentiation of the epidermis in numerous tissues. the arabidopsis genome contains  <dig> class iv hd-zip family members including arabidopsis thaliana meristem layer <dig> , glabra <dig> , anthocyaninless <dig> , protodermal factor <dig>  and homeodomain glabrous <dig>  through hdg <dig>  most class iv hd-zip tfs are expressed specifically in the outer cell layer of the plant organs in which they play a role  <cit> . gl <dig>  atml <dig> and pdf <dig> were among the first that have been well characterized. they are thought to be involved in establishing cell fates in the epidermal layer through the regulation of cell layer-specific gene expression. gl <dig> seems to be required for trichome differentiation and maintenance, but it is dispensable for trichome initiation  <cit> . atml <dig> and pdf <dig> are a pair of functionally redundant, paralogous genes which are expressed in all cells of the proembryo from the one-cell stage to the 16-cell stage, when their expression becomes progressively restricted to the outer cell layer  <cit> . hdg <dig> and hdg <dig> are important for normal trichome development  <cit> . there is also functional redundancy between gl <dig> and hdg <dig>  and gl <dig> transcript levels are maintained through a positive feedback loop involving gl <dig> activation of myb <dig>  <cit> .

the class iv hd-zip tf genes have also been identified in several crop species including maize   <cit> , tomato   <cit> , cotton   <cit> , and rice   <cit> . in cucumber, trichomes cover almost all aerial organs such as the hypocotyl, cotyledons, true leaves, stem, tendrils, flowers, and fruits. trichomes on the fruits are commonly called fruit spines, and are an important trait in assessment of cucumber fruit quality in different market classes. for example, fruits with large, sparse spines are preferred for american pickles. the north china fresh market type cucumber fruits are covered with dense small spines, and the european greenhouse type or mini  cucumbers are often glossy and smooth with fine, nearly invisible hairs. despite of its importance in cucumber breeding, little is known about the genetic or regulatory mechanisms of fruit spine or trichome development in cucumber.

several spontaneous glabrous mutants in cucumber have been reported and characterized. the first one is “cucumber glabrous-1” or “micro-trichome ”  <cit> . the csgl <dig> mutant shows no observable trichomes on leaves, stems, tendrils, and floral organs, but has obvious trichomes on the hypocotyl. under an sem, many papillae could be observed on the epidermis of the mutant leaves, with the papillae density similar to the trichome density of the wild type suggesting that csgl <dig> may be involved in foliar trichome development but not initiation  <cit> . map-based cloning has revealed that csgl <dig> encodes a class i hd-zip tf, and the loss-of-function csgl <dig> is due to a 2649-bp genomic dna deletion spanning the first and second exons of csgl <dig>  <cit> . the tiny branched hair  mutant reported by chen et al.  <cit>  is probably the same as csgl <dig> . the csgl <dig> mutant from cucumber germplasm line ncg- <dig> exhibited glabrous stem, petioles, and leaves whereas the surface of the fruits, sepals, fruit peduncles and pedicel of flowers were covered with sparse and fine hairs  <cit> . more recently, zhao et al.  <cit>  reported a spontaneous “trichome-less ” mutant that was completely free from trichomes on all aerial organs, which is true even under an sem suggesting the tril gene may function in trichome cell fate determination  <cit> .

in arabidopsis, mature leaf trichomes are characteristically large branched hair cells whose nuclei have undergone multiple rounds of endoreplication and are present on the leaf surface in a nonrandom regular distribution  <cit> . in contrast, cucumber trichomes are multicellular and non-glandular with malformed organelles and do not undergo endoreplication in development  <cit> . the role on trichome development by a class i hd-zip tf like csgl <dig> in cucumber  <cit>  has not been found in arabidopsis. these observations suggest that trichome development in cucumber may be regulated by distinct mechanisms from those in arabidopsis. here, we reported the identification, map-based cloning and characterization of a new trichome mutant in cucumber, cucumber glabrous  <dig> . we presented evidence that the loss-of-function of csgl <dig> was due to the insertion of a 5-kb long tandem repeat  retrotransposon and csgl <dig> may be involved in determination of the trichome cell fate.

RESULTS
the spontaneous mutation in ril-46 m was controlled by a single recessive gene csgl3
in the  <dig> winter greenhouse season, one glabrous plant, ril-46 m  was found in the recombinant inbred line ril- <dig>  from wi2757 × true lemon mating. the self-pollinated progeny of ril-46 m remained glabrous. the plants at the previous generation  of ril- <dig> were segregating for this trait at roughly  <dig> non-glabrous to  <dig> glabrous . f <dig> and f <dig> plants in the pedigree of ril- <dig> were all of wild type . glabrous plants were never observed in the two parental lines wi <dig> and true lemon, each of which had been selfed for at five generations. both ril-46 m and ril-46 w were gynoecious. to eliminate the possibility that the glabrous allele was introduced from other pollen sources , we genotyped ril-46 m and ril-46 w with  <dig> highly polymorphic ssrs that were used in polymorphic screening in genetic mapping of this gene , and no polymorphism was found between the two sibling lines. these data supported that ril-46 m was a spontaneous mutation occurring at the f <dig> generation during the development of wi2757 × true lemon rils. this also suggested that ril-46 m and ril-46 w were near isogenic lines  at the glabrous mutation locus.

the trichomes on ril-46 m, ril-46 w,  <dig> as well as ril-46 m × 9930 f <dig> were examined visually or with a dissecting or electron microscope. representative images of the true leaves, tendrils, stems, ovaries of these materials are shown in fig.  <dig>  as compared with the wild type  <dig> and ril-46 w , the hypocotyl, cotyledons, true leaves and petioles, the stem, tendrils, sepals and pedicles of flowers, ovaries, fruits, and fruit peduncles of ril-46 m mutant plants were all free from trichomes . on the other hand, except for the glabrous phenotype in ril-46 m, there were no observable differences between the two nils in growth habit, growth vigor or growth rate, flowering time, fruit and seed setting indicting no obvious pleiotropic effects of this trichome mutation on other traits.fig.  <dig> trichome phenotypic characterization of different cucumber lines. images of cucumber inbred lines  <dig> , ril-46 w , ril-46 m  and ril-46 m × 9930 f <dig> . for each line, trichomes of emerging young leaves , female flowers and stem , tendrils  and the hypocotyl  are shown. bar = 1 mm in a <dig> to d3; bar = 100 μm in a <dig> to d4

fig.  <dig> trichomes on hypocotyls and unexpanded true leaves on  <dig> , ril-46 m , and wi <dig>  glabrous mutants. ril-46 m is completely glabrous on all aerial parts  whereas wi <dig> exhibits sparsely distributed trichomes on both hypocotyl and true leaves . bar = 1 mm ; bar = 500 μm ; bar = 100 μm 



a noticeable difference between ril-46 m  and the csgl <dig> glabrous mutant wi <dig> was the distribution of trichomes on the hypocotyl and emerging true leaves  in wi <dig> . under a dissecting microscope, while ril-46 m was trichome free, wi <dig> exhibited short and sparsely distributed trichomes, although less pronounced than the wt . consistent with these observations, under an esem , while the wt ril-46 w exhibited many typical multicellular trichomes on the epidermis of all organs examined , only tiny trichomes with aberrant cells were seen in csgl <dig> mutant , and no trichomes could be observed in the csgl <dig> mutant . in addition, the trichomes on the hypocotyl in the csgl <dig> mutant were obvious except for the head  cell and base cells of each trichome that did not seem well developed. these results clearly suggested that ril-46 m is a distinct mutant from csgl <dig> fig.  <dig> esem images of trichomes on young leaf, stem, ovary and hypocotyl of ril-46 w , ril-46 m  and wi <dig> . as compared with wt, csgl <dig> mutant has aberrant trichome cells that fail to develop into mature trichomes whereas csgl <dig> mutant completely lacks trichome cell development. the trichomes on hypocotyl of the csgl <dig> mutant were relatively well developed but the head and base cells of each trichome  were morphologically different from those in wt . sp = fruit spine, bc = base cell, hc = head  cell, tr = trichomes, gc = guard cells, pc = pavement cells, st = stomata. bars = 100 μm



segregation data in four f <dig> or bc <dig> populations from different crosses are presented in table  <dig>  the f <dig> plants from both 9930 × ril-46 m  and gy14 × ril-46 m showed no differences in trichome morphology and density as compared with its wild type parental lines   indicating the recessive nature of the mutation in ril-46 m. among 665 f <dig> plants from the 9930 × ril-46 m cross,  <dig> and  <dig> showed wild type and completely glabrous phenotype, respectively. this was consistent with the expected 3: <dig> segregation . similarly, the segregation in the bc1p <dig>  bc1p <dig>  and gy14 × ril-46 m f <dig> populations all agreed with a single recessive gene underlying the glabrous phenotype in ril-46 m . in light of the phenotypic differences of this mutant with previously reported csgl <dig>  and csgl <dig>  this new mutation was designated as csgl <dig> table  <dig> phenotypic segregation at the csgl <dig> locus among different populations

fine mapping identified a class iv hd-zip tf as the candidate gene for csgl3
from  <dig> bc1p <dig> plants of ril-46 m ×  <dig> , two dna pools, the m-pool  and the wt-pool , were constructed. among  <dig> ssr markers tested,  <dig> were polymorphic between the two pools: ssr <dig> and ssr <dig> were located on chromosome  <dig> and the other four  on chromosome  <dig>  the two chromosome- <dig> markers were excluded after linkage analysis with  <dig> bc1p <dig> plants . thus, initial mapping placed the csgl <dig> locus in chromosome  <dig> linked with four markers with ssr <dig> being the closest. since ssr <dig> was physically located in the gy <dig> scaffold <dig> and  <dig> scaffold <dig>   <dig> additional ssr markers from the two scaffolds were tested, and three  were polymorphic between the two pools. linkage analysis of the  <dig> markers in  <dig> bc1p <dig> plants identified ssr <dig> and uw <dig> flanking the csgl <dig> locus at a distance of  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm, respectively . the physical distance between the two flanking markers was  <dig>  mbp in  <dig> scaffold <dig>  information about these and all other markers used in the present study is provided in additional file 1: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> fine genetic mapping of the csgl <dig> locus. a  <dig>  kb region in chromosome  <dig> was identified to harbor the csgl <dig> gene with genetic mapping by stepwise increase of the population size and scaffold-based chromosome walking . twelve genes were predicted in the  <dig>  kb region and the 8th, a class iv hd-zip tf was the candidate gene for csgl <dig> . numbers to the left of the chromosome are genetic distance in cm. numbers within the chromosome bars in b and c are number of recombinants in the interval



the ril-46 m mutant was derived from the cross of wi <dig> with true lemon. to identify the origin of the nearly  <dig>  mbp dna fragment harboring the csgl <dig> locus, we re-sequenced the genomes of both parental lines. the illumina short sequence reads were aligned with gy <dig> scaffold <dig> reference;  <dig> indel and  <dig> ssr markers  <cit>  within the  <dig>  mbp region were identified, which were polymorphic between wi <dig> and true lemon and used to genotype ril-46 m. all  <dig> markers were polymorphic between ril-46 m and true lemon, but monomorphic between ril-46 m and wi <dig> suggesting this  <dig>  mbp region was originated from wi <dig>  therefore, the wi <dig> resequencing reads were employed in subsequent marker development for fine mapping of csgl <dig>  from  <dig> ssrs and  <dig> indels in this region,  <dig> new polymorphic markers were identified. a linkage map  was developed with these markers in  <dig> bc1p <dig> plants. now the csgl <dig> locus was flanked by gl_indel <dig> and uw <dig> which were 210 kb apart in  <dig> scaffold <dig> 

a new set of 665 f <dig> plants was screened with gl_indel <dig> and uw <dig>  and  <dig> recombinants were identified in this interval . six snps between wi <dig> and  <dig> in the 210 kb region were employed to develop dcaps markers, of which three  were successfully mapped. linkage analysis revealed that gl_dcaps <dig> was co-segregating with csgl <dig>  whereas gl_dcaps <dig> and gl_dcaps <dig> flanked the csgl <dig> locus at  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm, respectively, which was approximately  <dig>  kb physically.

we annotated this  <dig>  kb genomic dna region and  <dig> genes were predicted . information about the position and predicted functions of each gene is presented in additional file 1: table s <dig>  to pinpoint possible candidate gene of csgl <dig>  we first looked into sequence variations in this  <dig>  kb region by alignment of the genomic dna sequence of wi <dig> to  <dig> scaffold <dig>  ten snps or indels were identified, of which  <dig> were located in the intergenic region and one in the first intron of the 11th predicted gene suggesting that these sequence variations are unlikely associated with the glabrous mutation in ril-46 m. we further conducted sequence alignment of this  <dig>  kb region with  <dig> other re-sequenced, non-glabrous cucumber lines. no consistent marker-phenotype association was found among these lines , which provided additional evidence that the  <dig> snps or indels were not associated with the csgl <dig> mutation.

among the  <dig> annotated genes in the  <dig>  kb region, the 8th one  was predicted to encode a member of the class iv hd-zip tf. in the  <dig> draft genome, this gene was 5188 bp in length with  <dig> exons  and encoded a protein of  <dig> amino acids with the conserved homeodomain  and start domain . we investigated its expression in the apical buds of ril-46 w  and ril-46 m  with qpcr . the expression level of the csgl <dig> candidate gene was nearly  <dig> times as high in the wt as in the csgl <dig> mutant where it was almost undetectable. consistent with this, when we ran a semi quantitative rt-pcr analysis of the csgl <dig> candidate gene using primer pair gl3_rt <dig> spanning the 4th and 5th exons , the pcr product in ril-46 m was not detectable in agarose gel electrophoresis whereas the band of ril-46 w was bright and strong  suggesting that the glabrous mutation in ril-46 m was probably due to change in exons  <dig> and  <dig> of the csgl <dig> candidate gene resulting in the loss-of-function of this gene.fig.  <dig> predicted gene structure of the wild type  and mutant  alleles of csgl <dig> candidate gene  and annotated 5005-bp ltr retrotransposon . boxes and lines indicate exons and introns, respectively. there are  <dig> exons in the predicted gene, and the mutant allele is due to insertion of 5005-bp ltr-rt at the 4th exon . the ltr-rt is predicted to encode all protein domains required for active transposition . boxes or lines are not drawn to scale

fig.  <dig> relative transcript abundances of csgl <dig> and csgl <dig> genes in different genetic backgrounds . a expression of csgl <dig> is nearly undetectable in csgl <dig>  and csgl1 +  <dig> double mutant , and it is reduced by approximately half in csgl <dig> mutant. b semi rt-pcr of csgl <dig> between ril-46 m and ril-46 w suggests the transcript of 4th exon is missing in the mutant. c pcr cloning of the full-length cdna of csgl <dig> between ril-46 m and ril-46 w suggests missing of the 4th exon sequence in the transcript of the mutant line. d expression of csgl <dig> was almost undetectable in all mutant lines



we cloned cdna sequences of csgl <dig> from ril-46 w and ril-46 m . the pcr product from ril-46 w had the expected full length, but the band from ril-46 m mutant was ~400 bp shorter . alignment of the cdna sequences between ril-46 w and ril-46 m revealed that the predicted 438-bp 4th exon in csgl <dig> was missing in the csgl <dig> mutant.

the loss-of-function mutation of csgl <dig> is due to insertion of a 5-kb ltr retrotransposon
we cloned the csgl <dig> genomic dna sequences from ril-46 m and ril-46 w. while the pcr product size in ril-46 w was expected, primers designed in the 4th and 5th exonic region amplified a dna fragment that was 5 kb longer in ril-46 m than in ril-46 w indicating a large dna insertion in the mutant. indeed, sequencing of the full length of csgl <dig> allele revealed a 5005 bp insertion in the 4th exon of csgl <dig> resulting in a  <dig> -bp fragment in ril-46 m . the complete sequences of csgl <dig>  and csgl <dig>  alleles were provided in additional file  <dig>  comparison of the csgl <dig> sequences among ril-46 m, ril-46 w and wi <dig> revealed no sequence variations except for the 5005 bp insertion in ril-46 m.

in the csgl <dig> genomic dna sequence, the 5005 bp insertion was flanked with the 5′-aaccat-3′ insert target site duplication . self-alignment of this sequence with dot-plot revealed the presence of ~200 bp long terminal repeats . indeed, alignment between the first and last 300 bp of the insertion confirmed the presence of a 222-bp ltr beginning with a 5′-gt-3′ and ending with a 5′-ta-3′. the ltrs shared 100 % sequence identity with one another. annotation of this 5005 bp sequence suggested that this ltr retrotransposon  had a complete gene structure with five exons and four introns, and the coding regions were predicted to encode four conserved protein domains including rnase_hi_rt_ty <dig>  rvt_ <dig>  rve and ubn <dig> , which are typical of ltr-rts  <cit> . according to the classification of transposable elements  in plant genomes  <cit> , this ltr-rt was an autonomous, class i/copia type te which seemed to be active in the ril-46 m genome.

the 5-kb ltr-rt was copious in the cucumber genome but the insertion at the csgl <dig> locus in ril-46 m was unique in natural populations
ltr-rts are widely present in plant genomes and play important roles in genome evolution  <cit> . to assess the distribution of this ltr-rt in the cucumber genome, using the  <dig>  bp csgl <dig> sequence as the reference, we aligned the illumina short reads of  <dig> cucumber lines of different botanical varieties including a wild , two semi-wild xishuangbanna  and four cultivated  cucumber lines. the frequency distribution of raw reads in each re-sequenced genome  suggested that this ltr-rt is presented in each genome in much higher copies than surrounding sequences. in addition, no significant variations of copy numbers were observed in different botanical varieties indicating this ltr-rt existed well before the divergence of different cucumber linages. we also blasted this ltr-rt sequence in the draft genome assemblies of gy <dig> and  <dig> cucumbers, as well as melon , and found multiple copies of this sequence in all genome assemblies although it was difficult to determine if the complete whole 5005-bp sequence was present in the assemblies .fig.  <dig> distribution of the 5005-bp ltr-rt in the cucumber genome. alignment of illumina short reads of seven cucumber lines against the csgl <dig> mutant allele indicates multiple copies of this ltr-rt in the se-sequenced genoems



to confirm the identity of the 5 kb ltr-rt insertion with the glabrous mutation in ril-46 m, we investigated the allelic diversity at csgl <dig> locus in natural populations. three primers were designed including two  from the 4th and 5th exons of the csgl <dig> gene flanking the insertion point, and one  within the ltr-rt . duplex pcr with the three primers allowed identification of wild type  and mutant type homozygotes , as well as heterozygotes  at the csgl <dig> locus. among  <dig> cucumber lines examined, all amplified the 461 bp fragment , which was consistent with the non-glabrous phenotype of these lines. this provided additional evidence that the 5005 bp insertion in csgl <dig> was indeed the casual mutation for the glabrous phenotype in ril-46 m.

csgl <dig> is epistatic to csgl <dig> in trichrome organogenesis
we developed a segregating population from the cross between two glabrous mutants ril-46 m  and wi <dig> . the f <dig> was wild type . in f <dig> plants, three phenotypes could be recognized: wt, csgl1-type that had the characteristic trichomes on the hypocotyl and petioles of unexpanded leaves, and csgl3-type which was completely free from trichomes on any aerial organs . among 89 f <dig> plants,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were wt, csgl1-type and csgl3-type, respectively, which was consistent with a segregation ratio of 9:3: <dig> . these results indicated that csgl <dig> and csgl <dig> were two independent, recessively inherited loci, and csgl <dig> seemed to be epistatic to csgl <dig> in phenotypic expression.

we investigated the expression of both genes in the csgl <dig>  csgl <dig> and csgl1 +  <dig> genetic backgrounds. the double mutant csgl1 +  <dig> carrying both genes were identified from the above-mentioned f <dig> population with gene-specific molecular markers . the expression levels of csgl <dig> and csgl <dig> in three genetic backgrounds were illustrated in fig. 6a  and fig. 6d . both csgl <dig> and csgl <dig> were highly expressed in the apical buds in wt, and almost undetectable in the csgl1 +  <dig>  background. csgl <dig> had practically no expression in either csgl <dig> or csgl <dig> background. csgl <dig> showed minimal expression in the csgl <dig> background, and its expression was reduced by nearly half in the csgl <dig> background as compared with that in wt . from these results, it was evident that csgl <dig> and csgl <dig> had interactions with each other: while the expression of csgl <dig> was dependent on csgl <dig> genetic background, the expression of csgl <dig> was also affected by csgl <dig>  which was consistent with the epistatic effect of csgl <dig> over csgl <dig> revealed from the segregating data.

phylogenetic analysis grouped cucumber csgl <dig> with class iv hd-zip homologs in other species with similar functions
to understand the structural and functional relationships between csgl <dig> in cucumber and class iv hd-zip proteins in other species, we conducted phylogenic analysis of csgl <dig> with  <dig> other hd-zip class iv tfs including  <dig> from arabidopsis ,  <dig> from tomato ,  <dig> from maize ,  <dig> from rice , and  <dig> from cotton . the cucumber csgl <dig> was used as an outlier. the neighbor-joining tree is shown in fig.  <dig>  it was clear that clustering of these sequences was based first on their functions and then on their phylogenetic distances. atml- <dig> and pdf <dig> are two paralogs arisen from arabidopsis genome duplication that are indispensable for epidermal cell-fate specification in the embryos  <cit> . cucumber csgl <dig>  tomato wo and cotton ghhd1a, and ghhd-1d were in the same clad as atml- <dig> and pdf <dig>  which all play important roles in trichome  initiation . csgl <dig> had  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  % amino acid sequence identity with gl <dig>  pdf <dig>  and wo, respectively. interestingly, osroc <dig> from rice, a monocot, was grouped in the same clade as other pdf2-like proteins from dicot species suggesting these proteins were highly conserved in both function and structure in flowering plants. this also implied that osroc <dig> may play a similar role of trichome initiation. on the other hand, the arabidopsis gl <dig> that acts downstream of atml1/pdf <dig> in the pathways regulating trichome development was much diverged and phylogenetically far away from csgl <dig>  the diploid cotton gahox <dig> gene, which regualts the fibre development in cotton  <cit> , was the closest one with gl <dig>  the function- and structure-based clustering was also evidenced from the fact that csgl <dig>  a member of the class i hd-zip tf family was separated far away from all class iv hd-zip iv members in the phylogenetic tree .fig.  <dig> phylogram of cucumber csgl <dig> and  <dig> other class iv hd-zip tf proteins. among the  <dig> proteins,  <dig> are from arabidopsis ;  <dig> from rice ,  <dig> from cotton ,  <dig> from maize , and  <dig> from tomato . the cucumber class i hd-zip protein csgl <dig> is used as an outlier in phylogenetic analysis. the neighbor-joining tree is constructed with the mega  <dig>  software  with  <dig> bootstrap replications. the numbers at each node is the probability that this node is supported 



discussion
genetic control of glabrous phenotypes in cucumber
in this study, we identified a new glabrous mutant that was controlled by a single recessive gene csgl <dig>  two cucumber glabrous mutants, csgl <dig>  and csgl <dig> have been genetically characterized previously  <cit> . the three mutants were phenotypically different. while csgl <dig> was completely free of trichomes on any aerial organs, the csgl <dig> mutant showed trichomes on the hypocotyls and emerging leaves, as well as tiny trichome cells  . for the csgl <dig> mutant, there were trichomes on the fruits, flower sepals, and fruit peduncle whereas the stem, leaf and petiole were largely glabrous. chen et al.  <cit>  described a spontaneous mutant, tiny branched hair  which had tiny and branched trichomes with increased density and aberrant cell shape. zhao et al.  <cit>  identified another mutant, trichome-less  that was completely free of hairs. based on the descriptions, the tbh and tril mutants probably corresponded to the csgl <dig> and csgl <dig> mutants, respectively. clearly the three glabrous mutants were under the control of different genetic mechanisms. indeed, csgl <dig>  csgl <dig> and csgl <dig> were located in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. while the nature of csgl <dig> is unknown, csgl <dig> and csgl <dig> have been shown, respectively, to encode a class i and iv hd-zip transcription factor .

arabidopsis trichomes are unicellular but undergo a complex developmental process including four rounds of endoduplication resulting in a genomic dna content of 32c in trichome cells  <cit> . in contrast, cucumber trichomes are multicellular which do not undergo any endoduplication in morphogenesis  <cit> . the role of class i hd-zip tf gene csgl <dig> in trichome development in cucumber has not been reported in arabidopsis  <cit> . differentially expressed genes identified in transcriptome profiling in the tbh mutant and its wild type were also different from what was observed in arabidopsis  <cit> . these results suggest that there may be different mechanisms regulating trichome organogenesis between cucumber and arabidopsis  <cit> . therefore, the csgl <dig> mutant reported herein may provide a valuable tool in understanding the regulatory network for trichome development in cucumber.

mutagenesis induced by ltr-rt insertion in csgl <dig> of cucumber
through map-based cloning, we identified a class iv hd-zip tf as the candidate gene for csgl <dig>  we showed that the loss-of-function of csgl <dig> was due to the insertion of a 5005-bp ltr-rt . ltr-rts are structurally similar to retroviruses that can move within a host genome through an rna intermediate by a “copy-and paste” mechanism  <cit> . at a single gene level, te insertions can result in loss of gene function, reprogramming of gene expression, gene deletions, rearrangements or transposition, coding-sequence exaptation and epigenetic effects, all of which have been well documented in a number of plant species . in cucumber, there was one report on te-induced mutagenesis in which the powdery mildew resistance was the result of the insertion of a 1449-bp ltr-rt in the 11th exon of the mlo-like gene major-effect qtl, pm <dig>  in chromosome  <dig>  <cit> .

most te insertion-induced mutations detected were historical events, but in the present study, examination of the pedigrees suggested that the ltr-rt insertion in ril-46 m occur in the f <dig> generation during ril development from the cross of wi  <dig> with true lemon. thus this was the first example that the action of a ltr-rt insertion causing loss of function of a gene was caught “red handed”. consistent with this, sequence analysis of this 5005-bp insertion revealed the presence of 100 % identical ltrs and tsds. the fact that the ltrs are completely identical to one another is an indication that the te is relatively recently inserted. this ltr-rt was predicted to encode all necessary proteins for transposition  suggesting it is an autonomous and active retroelement in ril-46 m.

this autonomous, active ltr-rt seemed to be unique to the ril-46 m lineage, but non-autonomous and inactive in other cucumber lines. sequence alignment indicated that this ltr-rt existed in multiple copies in seven re-sequenced cucumber genomes  as well as in the gy <dig> and  <dig> cucumber and melon  <cit>  draft genomes. these observations suggested that the ltr-rt sequence is widely distributed in the genomes of the cucumis species, which were diverged from a common ancestor ~ <dig> million years ago  <cit> . no intact 5005-bp full length sequence was found in the gy <dig>   <dig> or melon draft genomes, though. using the predicted 2994-bp coding sequence  in this ltr-rt as query, we blasted the gy <dig> cucumber leaf and root transcriptomes containing more than  <dig>  million ests from roche/ <dig> sequencing; no est hits covered the full length cds  indicating this ltr-rt may not be active in the gy <dig> genome.

possible roles of csgl <dig> in cucumber trichome initiation and development
the csgl <dig> protein shared  <dig>  % amino acid sequence identity with that of arabidopsis pdf <dig>  both of which were members of the class iv hd-zip tf family. phylogenic analysis placed csgl <dig> in the same clad as pdf2/atml <dig>  hdg <dig> of arabidopsis, ghhd-1a and ghhd1d of cotton, and osroc <dig> of rice . in contrast, the arabidopsis gl <dig>  which played a pivotal role in trichome morphogenesis after trichome initiation  <cit>  showed lower sequence identity  with csgl <dig> and sat at a distant location in the phylogenetic tree .

the arabidopsis pdf <dig> is expressed exclusively in the l <dig> cells  of the shoot apical meristem . pdf <dig> and atml <dig> are functionally interchangeable and work together to regulate the molecular pathway required for the differentiation of the protodermal cell layer in the embryo  <cit> . several other class iv hd-zip tf protein that were clustered in the same clad as atml <dig> and pdf <dig>  probably share the similar functions. for example, the cotton ghhd1-1a and ghhd1-1d, the tomato wo are all involved in trichome  initiation  <cit> . therefore, csgl <dig> may play similar functions in cucumber in cell fate determination and trichome initiation in cucumber.

we showed that csgl <dig> and csgl <dig> were two independent loci with csgl <dig> being epistatic to csgl <dig> . while the expression of csgl <dig> and csgl <dig> were barely detectable in their respective mutant or double mutant  backgrounds, the expression of csgl <dig> was significantly decreased in csgl <dig> mutant, and csgl <dig> was not detectable in csgl <dig> mutant . csgl <dig> encodes a class i hd-zip tf  <cit> . zhao et al.  <cit>  hypothesized that csgl <dig>  which shares 52 % sequence identity to arabidopsis atmi <dig>  may function negatively in trichome spacing and positively in regulating apical cell and stalk cell morphogenesis during trichome development. thus, csgl <dig> acts downstream of csgl <dig> in the trichome morphogenesis pathway, which seem to be consistent with phenotypic variations observed in the two mutants . zhao et al.  <cit>  conducted comparative transcriptome profiling at both csgl <dig>  and trichome-less  mutants. when compared with the wild type,  <dig> and  <dig> transcription factor genes exhibited significant differential expression in csgl <dig> and tril mutant, respectively. among them, the arabidopsis gl2-like and athb-51-like  genes were down-regulated in both mutants , whereas the expression of athb-21-like  was up-regulated in csgl <dig> mutant but not detectable in the tril mutant. in arabidopsis, gl <dig> is required for trichome differentiation and maintenance but is dispensable for trichome initiation; the two class i hd-zip family member genes athb <dig> and athb <dig> are broadly expressed in roots, leaves, stems, flowers, and siliques of adult plants  <cit> . in cucumber, glabra2-like and athb51-like genes were specifically expressed in the epidermis and trichomes, respectively  <cit> . these data provided further evidence to support the notion that csgl <dig> and csgl <dig> may play important roles in cucumber trichome development and initiation, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS
a new glabrous mutant, csgl <dig>  in cucumber was identified, which was phenotypically and genetically distinct from two previously reported glabrous mutants csgl <dig> and csgl <dig>  fine genetic mapping delimited the csgl <dig> locus into a  <dig>  kb genomic region with a class iv hd-zip tf in this region as the best candidate for csgl <dig>  the loss-of-function of csgl <dig> in the mutation was due to the insertion of a 5005-bp autonomous, active ltr-rt in the 4th exon of csgl <dig>  csgl <dig> was epistatic to the class i hd-zip tf gene csgl <dig>  which was responsible for the glabrous mutation csgl <dig>  csgl <dig> seemed to play important roles in trichome initiation whereas csgl <dig> may act downstream in the trichome development pathway.
