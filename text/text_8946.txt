BACKGROUND
over thousands of years, the success of plant breeding and selection has relied on phenotypic measurements and breeder experience. the green revolution has greatly boosted the world grain production from the 1940s to 1960s. the advent of molecular biotechnology has progressively provided improved tools for precision plant breeding for genetic improvement. the concept of marker-assisted selection  in plant breeding was proposed in the 1980s  <cit> , and has the potential to vastly enhance the efficiency of genetic improvement  <cit> . in the last  <dig> years, molecular markers have been gradually applied to assist plant breeding of agricultural crops. a small number of commercial varieties obtained through marker-assisted breeding were released in rice, soybean, maize, barley, wheat and potato  <cit> . however, the gap between the expectations and actual impact of mas is well recognised. most of the thousands of publications with the terms “marker-assisted selection”, “quantitative trait loci ” or “molecular markers” have failed to show any impact in plant breeding .

there are two major challenges in developing molecular markers for mas. firstly, markers must be closely linked to genes of agronomic traits of interest to enable the accurate prediction of desired plant phenotypes  <cit> . the most desirable markers for mas are “co-segregating”, where marker genotypes are completely consistent with plant phenotypes in segregating breeding populations. co-segregating markers offer maximum accuracy on mas  <cit> . secondly, the genotypes of the markers should match plant phenotypes in a wide range of breeding germplasm, allowing broad application in a breeding program. unfortunately, most of the molecular markers developed over the last  <dig> years through dna fingerprinting and genetic mapping are not on target gene sequences; and some genetic distances exist between markers and genes. as a result, genetic recombination may occur in the region between the marker and the gene on the chromosome during evolution and in the plant breeding process. in mas practice, it is a common problem that cultivars exhibiting desirable marker genotypes may not necessarily have the targeted genes and vice versa, which is known as “false positives”  <cit> . when a cultivar containing a desirable gene is crossed with a breeding line with a false positive marker genotype, the f <dig> progeny plants will show the same marker allele, even though the gene of interest is segregating; therefore, the marker cannot be used for mas. in order to deal with the prevalence of the false positives, molecular biologists have to undertake “marker validation” work to determine which markers fit which crosses in plant breeding programs  <cit> . the marker validation step not only increases the overall cost, but also greatly slows down the pace of mas . the best solution for this plight is to develop “diagnostic markers”  <cit> ; that is, markers which have marker genotypes consistent with plant trait phenotypes in all of the breeding germplasm in a breeding program. diagnostic markers can be used in mas without the marker validation step  <cit> . it is now well recognised that the development of diagnostic markers is the key for successful, large-scale and broad application of mas in plant breeding .

functional markers designed on target gene sequences are diagnostic  <cit> , but their development requires identifying, cloning and understanding the genes and their functions. non-genic diagnostic markers can be developed on random sequences without knowledge of the causal genes by dna fingerprinting and genetic mapping to select markers with genotypes matched to plant phenotypes in breeding germplasm . traditional methods of developing functional markers and diagnostic markers are tedious and time consuming  <cit> . the advancements in next-generation sequencing  and whole genome sequencing have vastly improved the capacity for marker discovery in plants. for example, more than  <dig> million snps were discovered in maize by genome sequencing and re-sequencing  <cit>  and  <dig>  million snps were obtained by re-sequencing a core collection of rice accessions  <cit> . although genome sequencing has been increasingly applied to a wide range of plant species in recent years, there is no report on how to use whole genome sequencing and re-sequencing data to overcome the key challenges and to develop markers widely applicable for plant breeding programs.

narrow-leafed lupin  was fully domesticated by the early 1970s in australia and is currently cultivated in australia, europe, america and africa. over the last  <dig> years, the dna fingerprinting method microsatellite-anchored fragment length polymorphism   <cit>  has been used to develop pcr-based markers linked to major genes of industry importance in lupin . a genetic linkage map was published in  <dig> based on a f <dig> recombinant inbred line  population originating from a wild × domesticated cross  <cit> . three updated versions of the map from the same mapping population followed . most of the markers on these maps were anonymous without sequence information. the application of ngs technology in the last four years has accelerated molecular research on this legume species. ngs has been used to end-sequence a small portion of a bacterial artificial chromosome  library  <cit>  and in a transcriptome study  <cit> . ngs was applied as a dna fingerprinting method to rapidly develop markers for mas  <cit> , and to construct a sequence-defined, dense genetic map in lupin  <cit> . more significantly, a draft genome sequence has been established, providing first insight into the lupin genome  <cit> .

phomopsis stem blight  caused by the fungal pathogen diaporthe toxica is a major disease in lupin. it infects young stems, remaining as a latent subcuticular coralloid hyphal structure in green plants  <cit> . upon plant senescence, the fungus colonizes the stems and develops large lesions. during saprophytic colonization, the fungus produces mycotoxins which can kill animals that graze on lupin stubble  <cit> . selection for psb disease resistance is a key objective in lupin breeding programs. conventional methods of screening for psb resistance are difficult and time consuming  <cit> . genetic analysis has indicated at least three major genes  among australian domesticated lupin lines, each independently conferring resistance to psb  <cit> . the r gene phtjr is present in cultivar tanjil, which has been extensively used as a parental line in the australian lupin breeding program since its release in  <dig>  seven sequence-specific, simple pcr-based markers were developed which flank the r gene phtjr  <cit> ; unfortunately, none have both the key characters of co-segregating and diagnostic desired for mas. the r gene phtjr has been integrated in the dense genetic map  <cit> . the objectives of this study were:  to undertake genome sequencing and re-sequencing on representative commercial lupin cultivars to discover molecular markers at the whole genome level, and  to examine the use of whole genome sequencing and re-sequencing to rapidly develop diagnostic markers closely linked to genes of agronomic interest for large scale application of mas in molecular lupin breeding without the knowledge of functional genes.

RESULTS

sequence comparison between the reference genome sequence cultivar tanjil and each of the nine re-sequenced cultivars revealed significant genetic diversity variation at the genome level and at chromosome level . cultivar unicrop, which was the earliest fully domesticated cultivar in this species with most distant pedigree kinship from later released cultivars, showed the greatest level of diversity. in comparison, cultivar merrit, which has the closest pedigree kinship which reference genome cultivar tanjil  <cit> , exhibited the least diversity among the nine sequenced cultivars . at chromosome level, the sequences in sequence-defined linkage group  <cit>  slg- <dig>  slg- <dig>  slg- <dig> and slg- <dig> were highly diverse; while slg- <dig> was more conserved, particularly in the second half of this linkage group .fig.  <dig> genome-wide genetic diversity as measured by snp abundance along each linkage group between reference cultivar tanjil and nine re-sequenced cultivars of lupinus angustifolius. twenty linkage groups  were displayed in a circle. the inner number was slg index and the outer was physical position . the circular histograms from circular  <dig> to  <dig> with different filling colour were snp frequency distributions of nine cultivars in whole genome and the response relationship was given in the core area. higher peaks indicated larger number of snps in the interval and lower troughs meant low abundance of snp. the snp frequency was counted in non-overlapping  <dig> kb intervals along each chromosome

linkage confirmation, validation, and application of established markers
the two sequence-specific, pcr-based snp markers developed from genotyping markers from the genetic linkage map, dafwa <dig> and dafwa <dig>  were successfully genotyped on the f <dig> population containing  <dig> rils segregating for the r gene phtjr  <cit> . linkage analysis using the software program mapmanager  <cit>  based on marker genotypes and psb disease phenotypes confirmed that these two markers are linked to the r gene phtjr with a genetic distance of  <dig>  cm, which would be approximately 99 % accurate for selecting lupin progeny with the r gene for mas.

three of the sequence-specific, pcr-based markers arising from marker mining on scaffold <dig> developed this study—snp <dig>  snp <dig> and indel10—were genotyped on the f <dig> ril population derived from the unicrop × tanjil cross which was segregating for the phtjr gene  <cit> . all three markers had marker genotypes completely consistent with psb disease phenotypes on all  <dig> rils . further validation identified marker genotypes consistent with psb disease phenotypes on all  <dig> advanced breeding lines and  <dig> parental lines used for crossing in the australian lupin breeding program.

the genetic linkage analysis and validation tests confirmed that markers developed through the two different approaches in this study were all superior to previously developed markers  <cit>  both in accuracy and in wide applicability. the two snp markers, snp <dig> and snp <dig>  which fit well with the cost-effective, high-throughput snp genotyping platform lightscanner, have been applied for mas in the australian lupin breeding program.

discussion
genome sequence is a fundamental knowledge in understanding the genomics, genetic and biology in plants. thanks to the advancements in parallel sequencing technologies in recent years, tens of thousands of genomes are in the process of being sequenced  <cit> . at current time, “close-to-complete genome sequences” have only been achieved on a few model plant species, such as arabidopsis, rice, brachypodium, and medicago  <cit>  where dna sequences are available almost continuously from the beginning to the end of each chromosome in the genomes. the lengths of sequence span of “complete” genome sequences are equal to the plant genome sizes. however, the majority of other published plant genomes are still at “draft” stage, where genome sequences are presented as large pieces of scaffold sequences. the scaffolds sequences can be aligned into each chromosome through the help of dense genetic linkage maps  <cit> , but many gaps exist between scaffolds on each chromosome. the sequence spans of “draft” genome sequences are smaller than the genome sizes. for examples, the length span of recently released high-depth  genome sequence  reached to  <dig>  % coverage of the oak tree genome size   <cit> ; the length of the genome sequence reported on setaria  was  <dig>  % of the genome size   <cit> ; the length of the cucumber genome sequence published  was approximately 66 % of the genome size   <cit> . the two major challenges for obtaining complete genome sequences in plant genome sequencing projects are the large genome sizes and the repetitive sequences  <cit> . the lupin draft genome sequence has a relatively low genome coverage at  <dig>  %  <cit> , which was duo to three factors: the lupin genome size is pretty large   <cit> ; the genome is rich in repetitive sequences  <cit> ; and the draft sequence was generated from a low costing sequencing project  originated from two sequencing libraries with sequencing depth only at 27x  <cit> . in this study, the genome sequencing and re-sequencing data were used in the identification and selection of candidate diagnostic markers linked to a gene conferring disease resistance. the final selected candidate markers then went through the genetic linkage confirmation step and validation step in the same way as in other standard marker development methods  <cit> . the linkage confirmation and validation steps ensured that the final markers recommended for mas were single copy in the genome, were closely linked to gene of interest, were applicable to wide range of breeding germplasm, and were desirable for marker-assisted plant breeding. there are lively discussions among plant scientists about what more can be gained from an in-depth, time-consuming and costly effort to generate high-quality complete sequences than from low coverage draft genome sequences  <cit> . the results in this study have demonstrated that low coverage genome sequencing and re-sequencing data were sufficient and very effective on marker development in molecular plant breeding. the same low coverage lupin genome sequence was also very successful in the discovery of a candidate gene based diagnostic markers linked to anthracnose disease resistance  <cit> , and in the conversion of previously established gel-based indel markers into snp markers to suit modern snp genotyping platforms for marker implementation in lupin breeding  <cit> .

this study was the first attempt at whole genome re-sequencing of the legume crop species l. angustifolius following a  <dig> report on its draft genome sequence  <cit> . comparing the genome sequences of  <dig> sequenced cultivars identified  <dig>  to  <dig>  million molecular markers, which demonstrated the power of whole genome sequencing and re-sequencing for marker discovery. these markers provide lupin breeders and molecular geneticists with a broader suite of options for a wide range of breeding and research purposes. lupin is a relatively new agricultural crop, domesticated in the early 1970s from its wild relatives. the abundance of snp and indel markers among commercial cultivars reflects the rich genetic diversity of the wild parental lines used in the domestication and breeding efforts over the last  <dig> years. it is evident that the selection pressure for certain desirable agronomic traits of interest in the lupin breeding program had a major impact on genetic diversity at chromosome level. for example, anthracnose disease caused a serious epidemic in australia in  <dig>  a major r gene, lanr <dig>  had been exclusively utilized by the lupin breeding program to combat the disease since  <dig>  <cit> ; which resulted in the lower genetic diversity in slg- <dig> where the lanr <dig> gene was mapped among the recently released commercial cultivars. in contrast, there are at least three major r genes each independently conferring resistance to phomopsis stem blight disease applied in the australian lupin breeding program  <cit> ; the lack of selection pressure for phtjr gene has helped to preserve the genetic diversity in slg- <dig> where the phtjr gene was mapped.

genetic mapping is a commonly-used approach for marker-trait association discovery in plant molecular studies. in the last three decades, genetic linkage maps have been constructed for most cultivated grain crops. the application of ngs and genome sequencing in recent years has enhanced the power of plant genetic mapping. for example, a genotyping by sequencing  study discovered and mapped  <dig>  markers in wheat  <cit> ; a whole genome sequencing study on a f <dig> ril population in rice mapped  <dig> , <dig> snp markers  <cit> ; and sequencing and physical mapping identified  <dig> ,161– <dig> , <dig> snp markers in each of four mapping populations in barley  <cit> . in this study, we anchored  <dig>  markers on the lupin genetic linkage map. in theory, all markers with known dna sequences on genetic linkage maps can be genotyped by whole genome sequencing and re-sequencing data. with so many markers available on genetic linkage maps, the genes of interest to breeders are usually flanked by a large number of markers, which provides ample choice for identifying diagnostic markers desirable for mas. yet with traditional methods, identifying diagnostic markers through conversion and validation tests on a large number of markers is tedious and time consuming. whole genome sequencing and re-sequencing has been demonstrated in this study to be a powerful approached to select diagnostic markers from genetic maps. the  <dig> lupin cultivars used in the genome sequencing and re-sequencing in this study were carefully selected based on their pedigree kinship to represent genetic diversity in commercial cultivars released in australia. therefore, most of the candidate diagnostic markers identified from genotyping these cultivars were validated as truly diagnostic on a wide range of historical and current commercial cultivars. two of the sequence-specific, simple pcr-based snp markers developed in this study, dafwa <dig> and dafwa <dig>  meet the two key requirements for mas of being “diagnostic” and “closely linked  to the target gene of interest”.

in molecular plant breeding, it is common that markers identified from dna fingerprinting and genetic mapping may not be diagnostic even though they are closely linked to genes of interest, which limited their application for mas in plant breeding . in this study, we demonstrated that whole genome sequencing and re-sequencing can be applied to develop diagnostic markers for mas through marker mining on scaffolds bearing non-diagnostic markers. all of the  <dig> previously-established markers linked to the  <dig> genes of agronomic interest in lupin were successfully located on their specific scaffolds in the genome sequence assembly. marker mining through scaffold sequence alignments obtained, on average,  <dig> snp markers and  <dig> indel markers for each of  <dig> scaffolds bearing markers linked to lupin genes of breeder interest. in the example of psb disease resistance, none of the three snp markers most-tightly linked  to the r gene phtjr on the genetic map were diagnostic. these three non-diagnostic markers were located on the same scaffold <dig>  of the  <dig> dna markers obtained from marker mining from scaffold <dig>  a staggering  <dig> markers showed a diagnostic nature in the  <dig> sequenced cultivars, which illustrates the effectiveness of this marker development strategy. three markers developed by marker mining on the scaffold  were confirmed as truly diagnostic on all of the commercial cultivars, breeding lines and parental lines, and co-segregated with the r gene which is highly desirable for mas.

development of diagnostic markers closely linked to genes of agronomic interest is the key to the successful broad application of mas in routine plant breeding. functional markers, also called genic markers, are clearly the best type of marker for mas because there is no risk of genetic recombination to cause false positives. functional markers have broad application for mas in a breeding program without the need for a marker validation step. in major crops, functional markers have been successfully developed and applied in plant breeding, such as functional markers for the pm <dig> gene conferring resistance against powdery mildew disease  <cit> , the cre <dig> gene conferring nematode resistance  <cit>  in wheat, the fragrance gene in soybean  <cit>  and the bacterial leaf blight disease resistance genes xa <dig>  <cit>  and xa <dig>  <cit>  in rice. however, a plant genome may contain tens of thousands of genes  <cit> , and the development of functional markers requires identifying, cloning and determining the functions of target genes, all of which requires considerable research effort. the principle of the methods in developing non-genic diagnostic markers through whole genome sequencing and re-sequencing seen in this study is the same as that for dna fingerprinting and genetic mapping in other crops, such as the ssr marker xgwm <dig> for yellow rust disease resistance  <cit>  and a sequence-tagged microsatellite marker stem rust disease resistance gene sr <dig>  <cit>  in wheat. the marker development strategies illustrated here do not require tedious gene cloning. in mas, markers linked to target genes within  <dig> cm genetic distance provide >99 % accuracy for predicting and selecting desired genes, which satisfies the needs of most plant breeding applications. in lupin,  <dig> cm genetic distance is equivalent to approximately  <dig>  mbp in the lupin genome  <cit> . such a large piece of dna in a chromosome would cover thousands of closely-linked dna markers, offering ample choice for identifying diagnostic markers for mas through marker mining by genome sequencing and re-sequencing. the methods demonstrated in this study provide a solution to develop diagnostic markers for plant breeding. further investigations such as sequencing the pathogen genome  <cit>  and studying the plant-pathogen interactions  <cit>  could lead to the identification of the r gene for the development of functional markers.

the lupin genome size is  <dig>  gb  <cit> , which is slightly larger than the soybean genome at  <dig> mbp  <cit> . currently, the cost of re-sequencing the whole genomes of nine lupin cultivars to a depth of 10– <dig> x including bioinformatics analysis is approximately us$ <dig>  at the beijing genome institute . the cost of genome sequencing and re-sequencing in a breeding program is a one-off cost. once the reference genome sequence and re-sequencing data are available, they can be used for genotyping and selecting diagnostic markers for any agronomic traits of interest within this species. therefore, whole genome sequencing and re-sequencing provides a cost-effective approach for marker discovery and development for plant breeding programs. once the marker development work is completed, it enters the marker implementation stage. molecular markers have been applied to large-scale mas in the australian national lupin breeding program since  <dig>  leaf samples were taken in breeder’s field plots commencing from three weeks after sowing early in june when plants were in the juvenile stage. tens of thousands of breeding plants were screened and selected with molecular markers annually  <cit> . the mas work was usually completed in the end of august at flowering. the application of mas has made a major impact on lupin breeding. for example, mas with markers linked to anthracnose disease resistance has replaced the tedious glasshouse and field disease screening trials, which not only saved the cost, but also increased the genetic improvement efficiency in lupin breeding  <cit> . the development of diagnostic markers reported in this study provides lupin breeders with new tools for mas to select phomopsis stem blight resistance in lupin breeding.

CONCLUSIONS
genome sequencing and re-sequencing revealed large genetic variations among commercial cultivars in lupinus angustifolius. we demonstrated two approaches for rapid development of diagnostic markers for mas by utilizing genome sequencing and re-sequencing data:  by genotyping and selecting markers from genetic linkage maps closely linked to genes of breeder interest, and  by marker mining from scaffolds bearing non-diagnostic markers. whole genome sequencing and re-sequencing provides an efficient and cost-effective way to develop diagnostic markers which has broad application in marker-assisted selection. this approach does not require the gene identification and cloning that is needed to develop functional markers. the marker development strategies illustrated in this study may overcome the bottleneck in developing markers with wide applicability in molecular plant breeding. whole genome sequencing and re-sequencing will facilitate diagnostic tests and selection without limitation of specific breeding parents or population structures. plant breeders will be able to precisely pyramid favourable genes and alleles to develop super crop varieties to meet the future food demand.
