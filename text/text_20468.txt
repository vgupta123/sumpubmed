BACKGROUND
plant growth, development and yield are influenced greatly by numerous biotic and abiotic stresses, including cold, salt, drought and soil salinization. plant stresses are generally controlled by a network of specialized genes through intricate regulation by specific transcription factors . the ap2/erf superfamily, which is one of the largest groups of tfs families, is involved in the regulation of plant developmental processes and biotic and abiotic stress responses  <cit> . this family includes all genes encoding at least one apetala <dig>  domain and can be further separated into ethylene response factor , ap <dig>  rav and soloist families. the erf family encodes proteins with a single ap <dig> domain, while the ap <dig> gene family codes for tfs with two ap <dig> domains  <cit> . lastly, the rav family encodes proteins processing a single ap <dig> domain plus an additional b <dig> domain, which is also present in other, non erf- transcription factors  <cit> .

to date, two major efforts to define a nomenclature for erf sequences have been published. sakuma et al.  <cit>  divided the arabidopsis erf family into two subfamilies based on the amino acid sequence of the dna binding domain, the cbf/dreb subfamily  and erf subfamily . these two families were then further subdivided into six groups  <cit> . conversely, nakano et al.  <cit>  divided the ap2/erf domain amino acid sequences, of arabidopsis and rice erf families into  <dig> and  <dig> groups, respectively. similarly,  <dig> groups were identified in the grape and cucumber erf family  <cit> .

after release of the whole genomic sequences of several plant organisms, a variety of ap2/erf tfs were successfully identified and investigated in several plants, including arabidopsis, rice  <cit> , grape  <cit> , poplar   <cit> , wheat   <cit> , cucumbers  <cit> , barley   <cit> , and soybean   <cit> . the ap2/erf tfs regulate diverse biological processes in plant function and development, such as hormones, reproduction, cell proliferation, and abiotic and biotic stress responses  <cit> .

the dreb subfamily is commonly used as a viable candidate to enhance crop abiotic stress tolerance. the dreb subfamily exhibits different response patterns under environmental stress, including low-temperature   <cit> , drought   <cit> , and high salinity   <cit> . the dreb tfs activate multiple dehydration/cold-regulated genes by interacting with dre/crt elements , which are present in the cold response/responsive to desiccation cor/rd gene promoters  <cit> . in addition, several dreb subfamily genes are reportedly positive and negative mediators of aba and sugar responses, primarily during the germination and early seedling stages  <cit> . therefore, the cbf/dreb family genes were annotated and a qrt-pcr platform that allows investigation of their expression profile was developed in the present study.

cabbage  is one of the most popular vegetable crops worldwide. currently, brassica crops are used for human consumption and provide resources for investigation of genome evolution of cabbage  <cit> . the b. oleracea capitata  genome was recently sequenced and assembled, http://www.ocri-genomics.org/bolbase/  <cit> . release of the entire cabbage genome sequence, as well as those of arabidopsis and b. rapa have provided an opportunity for comparative genomic study of ap2/erf tfs. characterization of ap2/erf superfamily genes in b. oleracea can clarify the molecular mechanisms responsible for abiotic stress responses to conditions such as cold, salt, drought and aba, which will enable development of, brassica varieties with increased tolerance to many adverse environments using transgenic technology. in the present study,  <dig> putative tfs in the ap2/erf family were identified from the database of the b. oleracea genome. bioinformatic methods were used to analyze the sequence information and construct a phylogenetic tree. some gene duplication events of ap2/erf family tfs in b. oleracea were found. identified b. oleracea cbf/dreb genes were then selected for quantitative real-time pcr analysis, to determine the expression level of tfs under different abiotic stresses.

RESULTS
identification of the ap2/erf family tfs in b. oleracea
the availability of complete b. oleracea genome sequences has made it possible to identify all of the ap2/erf family members in cabbage for the first time. to identify the four family genes, we conducted extensive blastn searches based on b. rapa and a. thaliana nomenclature suggestions  <cit> . our extensive search for ap2-domain containing proteins identified  <dig> distinct ap2/erf putative tfs . a total of  <dig> genes with a single ap2/erf domain were assigned to the erf family. additionally,  <dig> genes were grouped into the ap <dig> family, based on the presence of a tandem repeated double ap2/erf motif. the rav family included  <dig> genes identified as encoding one ap2/erf domain together with one b <dig> domain. the remaining genes, bol <dig> and bol <dig> were not only divergent from the erf family, but were homologous with arabidopsis and b. rapa soloist  and therefore designated as soloist.

previous annotations of ap2/erf genes nomenclature proposed by sakuma et al. <cit>  were based on homology of the dna binding domain alone. however, nakano et al. <cit>  proposed an alternative method, based on the presence of domains that were different from the dna binding domain. therefore, we subdivided the cabbage ap2/erf genes into  <dig> groups based on conserved domain similarities to b. rapa and arabidopsis ap2/erf tfs. cumulatively, the number of ap2/erf tfs in cabbage exceeded that in arabidopsis  poplar , and rice   <cit> . the proportion of each subfamily is shown in table  <dig> and additional file 2: figure s <dig>  the rav family number in cabbage  was larger than that in other plant groups, including arabidopsis , rice , and tomato , but lesser than that of b. rapa . cabbage contained more ap <dig> double domain genes in each subgroup than arabidopsis, and the dreb a- <dig> subgroup had up to two times more than arabidopsis.

phylogenetic analysis of ap2/erf tfs family
to investigate the evolutionary relatedness of the identified sequences together with ap2/erf genes encoded by the other fully sequenced chinese cabbage and arabidopsis, we performed phylogenetic reconstruction using the conserved ap2/erf transcription factor domain. the resulting phylogenetic tree  resolved  <dig> clades containing the erf, ap <dig>  rav and soloist families, which was in accordance with previous studies  <cit> . groups i to vi represent the dreb subfamily, while groups vii to xii represent the erf subfamily and groups xiii, xiv and xv indicate the ap <dig>  rav and soloist families, respectively. although the soloist transcription factor contained a single ap <dig> domain in cabbage, it clustered with the rav family, while the soloist transcription factor grouped with the ap <dig> family in grape  <cit> . we conducted a more in depth phylogenetic analysis of the ap <dig> family by selecting the ap <dig> family proteins, which contained two ap <dig> domains. chinese cabbage and arabidopsis were divided into two groups, ap2-r <dig> and ap2-r <dig>  respectively .

the conservative motifs among ap2/erf proteins in plants were clarified by conducting multiple alignment analyses using amino acid sequences of the ap2/erf domain. several genes were selected from each species of the ap2/erf family to identify the motifs. sequence alignment showed that the motif length in the rav and soloist family was longest, and contained  <dig> amino acids, followed by dreb . however, the ap <dig> family contained two groups , that might be responsible for the reduced motif length . the divergence between the two groups might affect the ap <dig> family motif length, with a higher divergence generally being associated with a shorter motif. the same explanation might be used for the erf subfamily , which contained six groups, and a shorter conserved motif. although six groups were identified in the dreb and erf subfamilies, the conserved motif was much longer than in the erf subfamily . the differences within the ap2/erf family were further analyzed by examining the dreb, erf and ap <dig> conserved motifs using the meme program. the results showed that all but two  of the six groups had a  <dig> amino acid conserved motif, which contained  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids in the conserved motif, respectively . in the erf subfamily, a shorter conserved motif was observed in erf-b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> than in the remaining erf group . therefore, if the erf subfamily motif length was dependent on the erf-b <dig> group, it might be responsible for the overall shorter erf subfamily motif. the ap2-r <dig> group contained  <dig> amino acids identified in the ap2-r <dig> group conserved motif .

sequence alignment of all ap2/erf families indicated that lg, aa and yd elements were highly conserved . the wlg element in dreb, erf and rav was more highly conserved than that in ap <dig> and soloist. in the soloist family, some wlg elements were converted into hlg elements. the ayd element was conserved in the ap2/erf superfamily, with the exception of soloist, where it was converted into lyd . we assume that specific conserved motifs are related to molecular functions. we use this assumption as an effective and practical means to predict unknown protein functions were derived from structural relationship in arabidopsis <cit> .

chromosome distribution of the ap2/erf tfs family
among all ap2/erf family tfs resolved in the cabbage genome,  <dig> genes belong to the dreb subfamily, followed by  <dig> in erf,  <dig> in ap <dig>   <dig> in rav and two belonging to soloist . a total of  <dig> ap2/erf tfs were distributed on nine cabbage chromosomes , and while  <dig> genes could not be assigned to any specific chromosome. chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> had the highest number of ap2/erf tfs , while the lowest ap2/erf transcription factor number was found on chromosome  <dig>  and  <dig> . the high ap2/erf sequence number on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> was primarily due to the increased number of dreb  and erf  subfamilies. interestingly, conserved sequences and the physical proximity of repetitive tfs, that belonged to the same group were identified and located on the same chromosomal regions as follows: bol <dig> to bol <dig> and bol <dig> to bol <dig>  were located on chromosome 2; bol <dig> to bol <dig> , bol <dig> to bol <dig>  and bol <dig> to bol <dig>  were located on chromosome 4; bol <dig> to bol <dig> , bol <dig> to bol <dig> , bol <dig> to bol <dig>  and bol <dig> to bol <dig>  were located on chromosome 7; bol <dig> to bol <dig>  and bol <dig> to bol <dig>  were located on chromosome 6; bol <dig> to  <dig>  and bol <dig> to bol <dig>  were located on chromosome 8; bol <dig> to bol <dig>  were located on chromosome  <dig> . similar patterns were also found in the arabidopsis <cit> , b. rapa <cit> , grape and poplar genomes  <cit> , which were suggested to represent paralogous segments resulting from ancestral polyploidization events. the highest number of rav tfs was found on chromosome  <dig> , followed by chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and cun , while rav tfs were not detected on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  moreover,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the dreb and erf tfs were observed on chromosome scaffolds .

we also investigated the cabbage paralogous ap2/erf tfs. a total of  <dig> ap2/erf tfs showed high homology  to the ap2/erf genes . the paralogous genes were indicated in the phylogenetic tree . duplication events have been studied in grape, and  <dig> proteins with high similarity sequences were reported  <cit> . in the present study, we identified  <dig> genes in the cabbage genome with 100% sequence similarity. among the  <dig> duplicated genes, eight were erf-subfamily members, while the rest belong to the dreb subfamily  and rav subfamily  .

ap2/erf tfs expression patterns in b. oleracea
we also investigated the expression patterns of b. oleracea ap2/erf genes during abiotic stress condition, such as cold, salt and drought using the microarray data. in this study, based on arabidopsis blast hits, cold, salt and drought expression profiles were downloaded from the atgenexpress visualization tool to evaluate responses to stress  <cit> . the results provided rich resource for gene discovery and investigation of gene expression patterns. a total of  <dig> ap2/erf tfs were obtained by expression profile tags . most ap2/erf proteins belonged to the dreb and erf subfamily. in the dreb family, gene relative expression profiles exhibited in all time courses had a high degree of expression pattern such as up  and down  - regulated genes. a few genes were not expressed  in response to any stress or throughout the study period . detailed expression values and clusters of each ap2/erf family transcription factor were analyzed using cluster analysis based on arabidopsis best hits of gene expression value . conversely, the predicted b. oleracea ap2/erf genes were annotated based on sequence alignment to non-redundant  public databases using blastn. each ap2/erf was annotated from the nr database was integrated and results provided in a supplemental file . interestingly, we identified five cbf proteins with the highest similarity to arabidopsis protein might be related to cold and freezing tolerance in b. oleracea from bolbase database using blastn. cellular localization is often an important factor in determining protein function. liu et al.  <cit>  has suggested that tfs are located only in the nucleus. psort was applied to predict and determine localization of bocbf proteins was in the nucleus. gene structure revealed that the all bocbfs had almost no introns. it was one of the representative characteristics of the cbfs family members, cbf proteins were well characterized listed in the table  <dig>  additional file 2: figure s <dig>  <cit> , and all five of the aforementioned genes were identified as the members of the dreb-a <dig> group. subsequently, cabbage and arabidopsis protein interactions, including functional and physical interactions were examined using the string software and the corresponding database to identify the protein interactions  <cit> . five proteins that exhibited increased sequence similarity to cbf <dig>  and cbf <dig>  were involved in stronger  interaction network. the bol <dig> protein, which showed high homology with cbf <dig>  was involved in weak interactions  with all genes . the former network largely participated in cold regulatory pathways, as most factors were related to cold stress, including cor <dig>  cor15a, kin <dig>  cbf <dig>  cbf <dig>  and ada2a  <cit> . many homologues are known to be induced rapidly upon exposure to low temperature, such as the atcbf1- <dig> genes from arabidopsis <cit> , and the zmdreb1a gene from zea mays <cit> . atcbf <dig> is not induced by cold, but the cbf <dig> network might be involved in drought adaptation  <cit> .

there were a large number of dreb- and erf-type sequences related to stress. we obtained five bocbf family genes based on the arabidopsis protein interaction. quantitative real-time pcr was used to analyze the expression profile of cbf/dreb family genes under cold, salt, drought and aba stresses using two contrasting genotype lines: cold tolerant bo <dig>  and cold susceptible bo <dig> . all genes analyzed exhibited differential accumulation in response to cold, salt, drought and aba .

evaluation of cbf gene expression revealed that some cbf genes in plant species could be induced by short term exposure to cold stress  <cit> . in our study, five novel bocbf genes showed different expression patterns when the plants were exposed to cold stress. detected transcripts, bocbf <dig> and bocbf <dig> were negatively regulated by cold stress; however, the patterns among them were not the same. specifically, bocbf <dig> was more highly up-regulated at 24 h than bocbf <dig>  while bocbf <dig> was elevated at 3 h, then declined after 6 h, but was maintained at a level higher at 24 h. bocbf1b and bocbf <dig> were also negatively regulated by cold stress. bocbf1b was more highly elevated at 6 h than bocbf <dig>  however, bocbf1b and bocbf <dig> had a similar expression pattern after 6 h, which might be resistant to cold stress. bocbf1a was regulated by both positive and negative at 3 h. ct line was more highly regulated at 3 h than cs, but was maintained at a level higher at 12 h. overall, these findings indicate that bocbf genes might be involved in mediating cold signaling transduction when plants are exposed to cold temperature. however, haake et al. <cit>  and medina et al.  <cit>  reported that cbf gene expression was modulated by salt and dehydration. bocbf <dig> and bocbf <dig> were positively regulated by salt stress; however, they showed similar expression patterns and maintained the high abundance at 6 h. bocbf1b and bocbf <dig> had similar expression pattern were negatively regulated by salt stress, which are shortly induced at 1 h followed by gradual decrease after 3 h which might be responsible resistant to salt stress. it should be noted that bocbf genes showed stress responsive  at 1 h, indicating that they play an important role in mediating salt signal transduction when plants are exposed to salt stress at short time. bocbf1b and bocbf <dig> had differential expression pattern, however, they had similar expression. cs and ct line has maintained the high abundance at 3 h and 12 h in both the genes respectively. bocbf1a, bocbf <dig> and bocbf <dig> were positively regulated by drought stress. however, these genes were not the same responses as at cold and salt stress. bocbf <dig> and bocbf <dig> were gradually elevated at 12 h, after which it declined. these results indicate that bocbf genes were dramatically influenced by drought stress, indicating, that they are involved in drought signal transduction through a positive regulation pathway. hong et al. <cit>  and kirch et al. <cit>  suggested that most cold-regulated genes are also responsive to aba. in contrast, medina et al. <cit>  reported, that cbf transcripts did not accumulate in response to aba. hence, it is necessary to determine whether the accumulation of cbf genes was specifically regulated by cold, salt and drought or was also influenced by aba stress. here, all bocbf genes were shortly induced and negatively regulated by aba stress. bocbf <dig> was showed similar expression pattern between ct and cs lines, which may not be response to aba stress. bocbf <dig> also showed a similar expression pattern between the ct and cs lines, although aba resistance gradually decreased than relative to the ct line. these findings indicate that bocbf1a, bocbf1b, bocbf <dig> and bocbf <dig> transcripts were negatively regulated in the aba signaling pathway. on the other hand, andersen et al.  <cit>  was suggested that, estimate the overall expression variation of the candidate genes and variation between the samples subgroups of the sample set. the candidates with lowest intergroup and intragroup variations give the lowest stability  value and are therefore ranked higher as more stable. we identified as the most stable expression in cold bocbf3_s , salt bocbf1b_s , drought bocbf2_s  and aba bocbf3_s  . this data indicates significantly more reliable qrt-pcr analysis. therefore, some of the novel bocbf genes identified in our study could possibly be used as target genes to improve plant resistance to abiotic stresses such as cold, salt, drought and aba. it will be useful to evaluate the functions of the bocbf genes, to generate transgenic crops with tolerance to abiotic stresses in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we identified  <dig> ap2/erf tfs in the cabbage genome and characterized their expression patterns in response to different abiotic stresses. to date, this is the first comprehensive and systematic investigation of cabbage ap2/erf tfs. we conducted quantitative rt-pcr analysis of some of the novel b. oleracea cbf genes identified in this study and found that they have the potential for use as target genes to improve plant resistance to abiotic stresses, such as cold, drought, salt and aba in two contrasting genotypes of cabbage. it will be useful to evaluate the functions of the bocbf genes to generate transgenic crops tolerant of abiotic stresses. overall, our genomic and bioinformatic analysis of the five family tfs and proteins presented in this work will provide an important foundation for further functional evaluations under different stress conditions.
