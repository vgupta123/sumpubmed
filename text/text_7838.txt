BACKGROUND
micrornas  are endogenous small non-coding rna molecules that are an average of 22 bp long  <cit> . they exist widely in metazoa, viridiplantae and viruses  <cit>  and play essential roles in gene expression regulation by binding to their target genes, leading to translational repression or transcript degradation  <cit> . the role of mirnas in the regulation of genes leads to their involvement in diverse biological processes that include animal organ development and growth  <cit> , cell differentiation and proliferation  <cit> , innate and adaptive immunity  <cit> , and signal transduction  <cit> . many studies have identified mirnas in fish species  <cit> . after mirnas have been identified in a species, one of the main aims is to identify the mirna target genes. computational predictions have been widely applied to mirna target identification  <cit> . common carp is one of the main commercial fishes captured and cultured worldwide. its agricultural production accounts for nearly 30% of fresh water fish cultured in china. however, mirnas targets have not been investigated in common carp.

mirnas bind to their target genes based on sequence complementarity. mutations in mirnas or in their target sites have been found to either create or disturb mirna-target interactions. many studies have reported the effect of snps in the 3’untranslated regions  of the target genes. for example, in texel sheep, a snp in the 3’utr of gdf <dig> created a binding site targeted by two mirnas, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  resulting in gdf <dig> inhibition and increased muscular hypertrophy  <cit> . in contrast, a snp in the 3’utr of the spl <dig> gene in rice perturbed osa-mir156-associated translational regulation which led to an improved rice plant with reduced tiller number, better gain yield and enhanced lodging resistance  <cit> . in addition, snps in mirnas have been shown to affect mirna regulation resulting in phenotypic changes  <cit> . for instance, in chinese holstein cattle, a snp in bta-mir- <dig> disrupted mirna binding which relieved the transcriptional repression and increased the expression of the target gene, the heat-shock transcription factor  <dig>  <cit> . moreover, snps in mirnas can also affect mirna biogenesis. two mutations in the seed region of hsa-mir- <dig> impaired the biogenesis of the mirna and result in a significant reduction of mrna targeting  <cit> . because of the recently recognized significance of snps in mirna biogenesis and regulation, many reports have concentrated on collecting mirna-related snps and investigating their influence on mirna function  <cit> . however, all these studies have focused on model species mainly because a substantial amount of information on mirnas and snps is available for these species. for common carp, no reports of mirna-related snps and their effects have been published so far.

in this study, we used a combinational strategy to identify mirnas in common carp and characterized them based on their conservation and expression profiles. next, we used target prediction software to predict the mirna targets. after identifying the potential targets we scanned snps in the mirnas and studied their effects on mirna biogenesis and target alteration. finally, we identified snps in targets’ 3’utrs and predicted the influence of the identified snps on mirna regulation of the target genes.

RESULTS
identification of common carp mirnas with computational prediction and small rna-sequencing
the previously published high-quality  bac end sequences   <cit>  that were assembled into  <dig>  genomic contigs, together with  <dig>  common carp transcriptome contigs  <cit> , were used as reference sequences for mirna identification.

to identify common carp mirnas, we firstly performed a homology-based prediction. the prediction pipeline is shown schematically in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  we downloaded  <dig>  animal mirnas from mirbase  <dig>   <cit> . the analysis of the hairpin structures of animal mirna precursors using unafold  <cit>  showed that over  <dig> % of mirna precursors satisfied the criteria for hairpin structures previously described by fu et al.  <cit>  [see additional file 2: figure s <dig>  we identified  <dig>  non-redundant mirnas after removing identical mirnas. after aligning the unique mirnas to the reference sequences and carefully evaluating the hairpin structures,  <dig> conserved mirnas were identified from common carp.

next, a small rna  library was constructed from multiple tissues of  <dig> adult common carp and sequenced following the illumina protocol  <cit> . a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw reads were generated and  <dig> , <dig> cleaned reads  were obtained and used in the analysis . the length of the cleaned reads peaked at 22 bp . using blastn searches, a total of  <dig>  cleaned reads  were identified as fragments of other srnas  and another  <dig>  reads  aligned to common carp repeats . these were removed from the dataset and the remaining  <dig> , <dig> reads  were used for mirna identification with mireap. a total of  <dig> srnas were identified as reliable mirnas. among them,  <dig> mirnas were homologous to known animal mirnas and the precursors of an additional  <dig> mirnas could be aligned to the ncbi non-redundant nucleotide database using blastn with an e-value of 1e- <dig>  the remaining  <dig> mirna had no hits, indicating that they might be common carp specific.

finally, the results from the two methods were integrated into a non-redundant dataset that included  <dig> conserved mirnas and  <dig> specific mirnas. the length distribution of the mirnas was between  <dig> and 26 bp. detailed information about the predicted mirnas, including the prediction method, conservation, reference sequences, location in the reference sequences, precursor sequences, hairpin structures, minimum folding free energies, mature sequences and a + u content is available in additional file 3: table s <dig>  additional file 4: table s <dig>  additional file 5: table s <dig>  and additional file 6: table s <dig> 

to validate the reliability of the predicted mirnas, their expression in the rnas from the pooled-tissues was examined by pcr. ten mirnas, including conserved and specific mirnas , were selected randomly from the dataset. the pcr results showed that all the selected mirnas could be amplified , indicating that these mirnas were correctly identified and truly expressed.

characterization of common carp mirnas
many mirnas are often located close to each other, forming gene clusters that have a common transcription promoter  <cit> . we discovered five mirna clusters  among the common carp mirnas. four clusters consisted of conserved mirnas while one cluster had one conserved mirna and one specific mirna. interestingly, three of the clusters contained mirnas from the mir- <dig> family. in the zebrafish genome , these three clusters are located close together, suggesting that they might also be part of one bigger mirna cluster in the common carp genome. we looked for members of the mir- <dig> family in other animals and found that this family existed only in zebrafish, medaka and sea lamprey. this result indicates that the mir- <dig> family might be fish specific. further experiments are warranted to study the function of this family of mirnas.

the srna sequencing allowed us to identify mirnas and also to determine the expression levels of the mirnas  <cit> . the number of reads that could be aligned to each of the mirnas was assumed to represent the expression level of the mirna. we found a lot of divergence in the abundance of the different mirnas . in general, the conserved mirnas had higher expression than the specific mirnas . this result is consistent with previous observations that non-conserved mirnas are often expressed at lower levels than mirnas with tissue-specific or developmental-specific expression patterns  <cit> . the seven most abundant mirnas, each with over  <dig>  reads, were conserved mirnas. these results agree with the conclusion that evolutionarily conserved mirnas are often the most abundant  <cit> . in contrast, mir-204*, mir-406b* and let-7a* had extremely low frequency in our library , consistent with the observation that most mirna*s showed weak expression and that their expression levels were much lower than their corresponding mirnas  <cit> . this is because mirna*s are rapidly degraded during the biogenesis of mature mirnas  <cit> .

the conservation of mirnas has been used to study mirna phylogenetic evolution  <cit> . twenty-one conserved mirna families were clustered into three groups based on their phylogenetic distributions . six mirna families  were shared by both protostomes and deuterostomes;  <dig> mirnas families were present only in vertebrates; and the remaining two mirna families  were identified only in fish and were possibly fish-specific mirnas. six mirna families  were first detected in fish, but have been identified in other species.

expression profile of mirnas among the developmental stages
the expression of homologous mirnas in other species may help us infer the expression of the common carp mirnas. to study the expression pattern of mirnas during the embryo development, we selected eight mirnas of which homologous mirnas were related to embryo development  <cit> . another four common carp specific mirnas were also randomly selected. we found that the expression patterns of some of the mirna families were associated with certain development stages. hierarchical clustering of the rt-qpcr products showed three major expression patterns: a) fertilized oocytes expression  which might be related to maternal mirnas; b) embryonic expression  during hatching; and c) larvae expression  when the larvae undertake exogenous feeding .

the expression levels of all the mirnas varied among the developmental stages. the expression levels decreased from the oocytes stage to embryonic stage and then increased again in the larvae stage. at the embryonic stage, the expression of the majority of mirnas was lower than at any of the other stages. the most dominant mirnas at the embryonic stage were from the mirna- <dig> family. the mir- <dig> family has been reported to be associated with mouse eye development  <cit> , indicating that this mirna family may play roles in organogenesis in the common carp embryo.

hierarchical clustering also indicated that the mirnas selected for rt-qpcr were classified into two groups based on their expression patterns. in general, the expression of mirnas in the first group  was higher than the expression of the mirnas in the second group . the similar expression patterns of the mirnas in each of the groups may imply that they share similar functions, which would help us understand the function of the specific mirnas based on the known function of other mirnas in the same group.

prediction of mirna targets
to predict mirna target genes in common carp, we downloaded  <dig> mrnas containing 3’utr information from genbank  <cit>  and used a combination of targetscan  <cit>  and pita  <cit>  to predict mirna targets. we identified  <dig> mirna-binding sites in  <dig> mrnas targeted by  <dig> mirnas; an average of  <dig>  mrnas per mirna. the predicted target genes were found to be involved in a broad range of biological functions; for instance, transferase activity, hydrolase activity, nucleotide binding, protein binding and signal transducer activity  had the most mirna binding sites;  <dig> sites targeted by  <dig> mirnas.

furthermore, we found  <dig> mirnas that were generated from the antisense strands of  <dig> mrnas. the mirnas were perfectly complementary to the sense mrnas [see additional file 10: table s <dig>  mirnas in such arrangements might function to depress sense mrna expression or to disrupt mrna splicing  <cit> .

to investigate the regulation of predicted targets by mirnas, the expression of four mirna-target pairs was examined by reverse transcribed-quantitative real-time pcr  analyses during five developmental stages. all four pairs showed significantly reciprocal expression patterns , consistent with the observation that mirnas in mammalian predominantly function to decrease target gene levels  <cit> .

influence of snps in mirnas on the energy of the mirna secondary structure
snps in precursors have been reported to enhance or interrupt mirna biogenesis  <cit> . we identified  <dig> snps in seven precursors by mapping the cleaned srna sequencing reads to the precursors. these snps were classified into four types: 1) two snps in the mature mirna; 2) six snps in the stem regions; 3) three snps in the loops; and 4) two snps in the anti-stem regions .

mfe: minimum free energy.

ΔΔg: the mfe difference value between snp-type precursors and wild-type precursors. the minus value indicated that the snp-type precursors had lower structure energy than the wild precursors. otherwise, the former had higher structure energy than the latter.

in addition, we pcr-amplified and resequenced five mirna precursors surrounding nine putative snps by conventional sanger sequencing. all the regions were successfully covered. when the sanger reads were compared with the reference precursors, we found that seven snps were successfully detected with sanger sequencing .

next, we investigated the effect of the snps on the energy change  of the secondary structures of the precursors. we found that snps in the loop regions did not change the energy of the structure while the other  <dig> snps  did change the energy of the predicted secondary structures. for nine of the snps, the absolute energy change values were ≥  <dig>  kcal/mol, the minimum energy change reported to be required to change the production of mature mirnas  <cit> . gong et al. summarized the rule that if a snp decreases the hairpin structure energy, the production of the mature mirna will be reduced; and if the snp increases the energy, the production of the mature mirna will increase  <cit> . the snps reported here might therefore enhance or reduce the production of the mature mirnas.

mirna-mrna interaction alteration by snps in targets
snps in the mirna binding site can alter the mirna-mrna interaction  <cit> . to identify snps in common carp mrna 3’utrs, we aligned the  <dig>  trimmed  <dig> transcriptome reads to  <dig> mrnas containing 3’utr annotation and identified  <dig> snps in  <dig> mrnas. a total of  <dig> snps were located in the 3’utrs of  <dig> mrnas. these mrnas were called snp-type mrnas. in addition, we pcr-amplified and resequenced ten randomly selected snps in nine mrna 3’utrs. a comparison between the sanger sequences and the reference 3’utrs showed that nine snps were successfully detected by conventional sequencing [see additional file 12: figure s <dig> 

fifteen snp-type mrnas were predicted to have  <dig> sites targeted by  <dig> mirnas. most of these binding sites existed in both the wild type mrnas and snp-type mrnas. however, one snp in the 3’utr of c1rs-a  was predicted to result in target gain and one snp in the 3’utr of cyp c <dig>   was predicted to lead to target loss . these two snps were also confirmed by sanger sequencing.

discussion
the aim of this study was to predict mirna targets in common carp and to in silico examine the effects of snps on mirna biogenesis and target binding. recently yan et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> common carp mirnas by sequencing srna library built from the muscle tissue. our dataset only covered  <dig> of the mirnas in their dataset. the difference in the two datasets is mainly because yan et al. aligned the sequencing reads to the zebrafish genome to predict the mirnas, while we used common carp sequences to identify the common carp mirnas. the researchers did not systematically characterize the common carp mirnas nor did they attempt to predict the mirna targets. in the present study, we identified mirnas and predicted the mirna targets which will make it into a useful resource for studying mirna function.

in our study, we classified the conserved mirnas shared by other animals into different groups to help us investigate the evolution of these mirnas during the divergence of the animals. we found that many of the mirnas were conserved among several animals, suggesting that they may have essential biological functions. the conservation of these mirnas may help us infer the functions of these mirnas in common carp based on their known functions in other species. we discovered six conserved mirna families in fish that are being reported here for the first time. two of the mirna families detected in the common carp were conserved only in fish, indicating that these mirnas might be involved in the adaption to the aquatic environment. strikingly,  <dig> mirnas are found only in common carp. it is possible that these mirnas are involved in regulatory interactions during adaptation to the common carp specific environment.

in this study, we focused on the identification and characterization of mirnas in common carp. recently, many studies identified mirna-offset rnas  generated from sequences immediately adjacent to the mirna and mirna*  <cit> , although their functional role remains to be elucidated and these srnas had no obvious sequence or structural features. indeed, after aligning cleaned srna sequencing reads to mirna precursors using blastn with an identity value of 100%, we found that the non-mirna regions in five pre-mirna loci had matched srna reads adjacent to mirnas, indicating that these srnas might be mornas additional file 13: figure s <dig>  another class of mirna variant is isomirs, which have variations with respect to the reference mirnas  <cit> . these isomirs are mainly generated by either a shift of drosha and dicer in the cleavage site or nucleotide additions at the 3’ end  <cit> . in our srna dataset, we also found that  <dig>  srnas were identical to the identified mirnas with either longer or shorter sequences, suggesting that these srnas are putative isomirs.

mirna target identification is important to predict the functions of the mirnas. although computational approaches have been widely used to predict mirna targets, most of these methods suffer from high false positive rates  <cit> . in the present study, we combined the results of two popular methods to predict mirna targets. using a set of  <dig> negative examples from tarbase  <cit> , we estimated that the false positive rates of targetscan and pita were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. significantly, a combination of these two methods gave a false positive rate of  <dig> %, much lower than by either of the methods alone additional file 14: figure s <dig>  we assume, therefore, that the strategy we have applied here should have reduced the number of false positive mirna targets to a low error rate.

because of the limited number of publicly available common carp genes with 3’utr information, the number of targets per mirna that we could identify was lower than the numbers reported previously  <cit> . even so, our prediction revealed that many of the genes were regulated by multiple mirnas. by targeting a gene with multiple mirnas the expression of the gene can be subtly and precisely regulated. as further information is obtained, we can expect further improvements in common carp genome annotation which will provide a better overview of its mirnas and targets.

no common carp snps are currently publicly available, making the identification of snps in mirnas difficult. a number of challenges including sequencing errors and post-transcriptional editing, would also lead to the sequence variability between srnas and reference mirnas. to avoid artificial variability by sequencing errors, we have filtered out the low-quality reads before aligning srnas to reference sequences. re-sequencing genomic regions of randomly selected mirnas and 3’utrs with snps using sanger sequencing revealed that most snps were successfully detected, indicating that the sequence variability was mainly from snps in genomic dna. the left undetected sequences might be from mirna post-transcriptional editing. many studies reported that mirna post-transcriptional editing could alter processing of some mirnas  <cit>  or modulate the target specificity of the mature mirna  <cit> . therefore, it is necessary to further analyze mirna post-transcriptional editing in common carp in the future.

we focused on the prediction of the potential effects of the snps in the mirna genes on mirna production and target selection. two snps in stem or anti-stem regions of the precursors led to energy changes of over 2 kcal/mol  might greatly change the mirna product. two snps were located in the mature mirnas. because of the limited number of snps and target 3’utrs that were obtained, we did not find any potential snps that change mirna targets. the targets of mirnas can be altered by variations in the target sequences  <cit> . mirna target loss may increase the expression of the mrna or protein, while target gain may repress protein expression or degrade the transcript. here, using our pipeline we identified many snps in potential mirna target sites. these snps will be important candidates for causal variants of common carp phenotypes.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides data for the identification and characterization of common carp mirnas and their potential targets. these results will help further our understanding of common carp mirna function in gene regulation. the study further identified snps in mirnas and their target genes and the effects of these snps on mirna biogenesis and function was discussed. the resource data described here will be a useful resource for the scientific community to study mirnas function and to find snp-associated phenotypes.
