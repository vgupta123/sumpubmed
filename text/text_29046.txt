BACKGROUND
structural genomics projects aim at high-throughput delivery of protein structures regardless of the state of their functional annotation. moreover, roughly half of gene-products delivered by completed genomes of various organisms do not show sequence homology to existing proteins of known function. therefore, structure-based prediction of protein molecular function is essential. protein 3d structures can be clustered according to their fold in classes which usually have some functional significance, e.g. scop  <cit> , fssp  <cit>  and cath  <cit> . more recently, researchers have investigated the detection of functional 3d patterns associated with active sites or/and atom interactions . these patterns may be based on secondary structures, such as the ef-hand domain and zinc fingers or sets of 3d positions of atoms involved either in h-bonds  <cit>  or ligand binding  <cit> . moreover, tools have been developed which allow the detection of residue based 3d patterns within a protein structure  <cit>  and the comparison of the 3d structure of binding sites with other proteins  <cit> . unfortunately, many patterns do not correspond to any specific function and the number of known 3d motifs is rather small compared to the number of sequential motifs captured in databases such as prosite  <cit>  and interpro  <cit> . so far, 3d motifs have been mainly the result of some manual and experimental process, e.g. the catalytic site atlas  <cit> . moreover, patterns are usually constructed on the basis of residues and are represented either by their cα atoms, atoms interacting with ligands or all their atoms.

although proteins are composed of amino acids which are very convenient and useful structural units for the analysis of proteins, ultimately chemical interactions happen at the atomic level. the associations of residues in physicochemical groups which are not mutually exclusive implicitly acknowledge the limitation of residue-centred approaches  <cit> . we propose a new approach where 3d motifs are generated automatically and are based only on consensus atom positions without explicit reference to the residues to which they belong and the direct interactions they may have with ligands. in this work, the ligand binding sites of a protein are compared by superimposing the corresponding ligands. the similarity between ligand environments is then evaluated by calculating the number of atoms of the same type which share equivalent spatial positions. by converting that similarity measure into a normalised metric, a similarity matrix can be generated for a given set of proteins in order to permit clustering of their ligand binding sites. subsequently, consensus 3d patterns can be produced to represent each of the clusters. because the clusters can be shown to be associated with specific biochemical functions, protein structures can be compared to these 3d motifs in order to predict their function.

RESULTS
3d pattern generation for adenine phosphate
we evaluated our method by automatically generating 3d patterns for the main adenine based ligands, i.e. amp, adp and atp. these ligands were selected because they are relatively common, key to many biochemical reactions and contain rigid groups which make their superimposition meaningful. subsequently, the patterns produced were tested against other adenine based molecules, i.e. acp and anp, and guanine based ligands, i.e. gmp, gdp and gtp. figure  <dig> shows the main chemical structures involved in the ligands of interest.

for each of the main adenine based ligands, a binding site similarity matrix was generated using ligand-specific training sets . in this work, two atoms of the same chemical type are considered to share a similar position if the distance between them is less than  <dig>  Å. this value was chosen because in previous work  <cit>  it was shown to be a good compromise between accuracy and flexibility. the binding sites were then clustered and outliers were removed using a similarity threshold st =  <dig>  . the consensus 3d patterns were generated for valid clusters that contain at least  <dig> binding sites. table  <dig> presents statistics associated with the  <dig> valid clusters identified using three main adenine based ligands amp, adp and atp, including the number of proteins from which they were generated and their core size.

the 3d patterns corresponding to the above  <dig> clusters were then compared in an all against all manner. clusters with highly similar 3d patterns were merged into new 3d patterns, resulting in a reduction of the number of clusters from  <dig> to  <dig> . merging was performed between amp and atp, adp and atp, but not between amp and adp clusters. the similarity threshold associated with each pattern was defined as the lowest similarity score between any pair of binding sites belonging to the cluster represented by that pattern. these values are called the automatic similarity threshold.

this table consists of the name of the pattern, its pdb representative , names of ligands the pattern was created from, the size of the cluster, the number of atoms in the pattern, the annotated function, the ec  number if relevant  <cit> , the protein fold classifications according to cath  <cit>  and dali  <cit> , and finally detected sequence motifs according to interpro   <cit>  and prosite   <cit> . when consensus values could not be found, but close alternatives were available, values are shown between brackets. finally, when data was not available through pdbsum, it was inferred when possible using homologues; in this case values are shown in italic. otherwise when not enough data was available to generate a meaningful consensus value, the code 'nd' is used.

the case of the  <dig> remaining 3d patterns  requires further analysis to decide if they can be classified as 3d motifs. consequently, we decided to check if any of the  <dig> patterns  correspond to structural templates generated from the annotated catalytic sites of csa  <cit> , see table  <dig>  submission of the representatives to the web server provided by csa returned only three hits which were classified either as probable or highly probable. since two of them did not target the adenine binding site, only one was relevant to this study. this csa template matched the binding site of 1ses it corresponds very closely to the axp <dig> pattern since out of the  <dig> residues present in csa,  <dig> of them are represented in that pattern.

this table consists of the patterns which were identified by other systems able to detect 3d motifs .

since csa recognised only  <dig> out of our  <dig> templates, we investigated if they could potentially be detected by other methods. the adenine binding sites of the representative proteins were submitted to the sumo server for 3d searches for functional sites  <cit>  and to the pints server find 3d local structural patterns  <cit> , which compared them to all ligand binding sites in the pdb  <cit> . sumo only detected strong similarities between the binding sites of the core proteins associated with the adp <dig> patterns:  <dig> proteins were ranked very high and only  <dig> protein was not matched by the site. for pints, all core proteins of adp <dig> and atp <dig> ranked very highly against their cluster representative. the existence of a common pattern was also detected with adp <dig> where only  <dig> protein out of  <dig> was not highly ranked. moreover, some evidence of binding site similarity could be collected for adp <dig> and axp <dig>  since respectively  <dig> out of  <dig> and  <dig> out of  <dig> proteins  were shown to share similar sites. results from these three servers confirm that our metric can be used for generating meaningful patterns, most of which are 3d motifs. moreover, the fact that only  <dig> of our  <dig> patterns could potentially have been detected by these systems suggests that our metric captures some new important features from binding sites.

structural alignment and complex evolutionary links
contrary to all the other patterns, adp <dig> does not correspond to a class with a common function, structure or sequence pattern. the analysis of the properties of the five proteins which comprise its core reveals that three of them are ligases  and two are transferases . structurally however, the 1ehi, 1e4e, 1gsa and 1kjq atp-binding domains are classified by scop  <cit>  as belonging to the atp-grasp fold and the glutathione synthetase atp-binding domain-like superfamily and share other structure and sequence patterns such as:

cath  <dig> . <dig> , fssp  <dig>   <dig> &  <dig>  ipr <dig> and ps50975

the 1iah structure, however, is classified by scop as a mhck/ef <dig> atypical kinase belonging to the protein kinase-like superfamily and fold; its structure and sequence patterns, namely cath  <dig> . <dig> , fssp  <dig> &  <dig>  ipr <dig>  ipr <dig> and ipr <dig> do not match the ones for the other adp <dig> proteins.

the vast structure similarity server  <cit>  does not detect any structural neighbour of 1iah within the cluster. neither does the multiple sequence alignment of these five proteins with either clustalw  <cit> , muscle  <cit>  or tcoffee  <cit>  show any sequence pattern shared by this cluster. however, their structural alignment constructed using our system highlights the following pattern: -x- , which is completed by two non-polar residues and a conserved lysine,    36– <dig> residues upstream. multiple comparisons with either the msdfold  <cit>  or ce_mc  <cit>  structure similarity search engines do not detect this pattern.

the sequences for these structures can be manually aligned with jalview  <cit> , using these constraints; see figure  <dig> where the pattern is highlighted. this reveals the remote similarity between 1iah and the other proteins of the adp <dig> pattern. figure  <dig> shows the 3d pattern and figure  <dig> shows the superimposition of residues whose atoms belong to the pattern.

taking into account that 1iah structure has a protein kinase-like fold, it is intriguing why our method clustered the 1iah atp binding site together with structures from the atp-grasp fold rather than with other protein kinases clustered in axp <dig> . atp molecules bind in the cleft between the n- and c-terminal lobs in all adp <dig> and axp <dig> proteins. detailed structural analysis  <cit>  revealed that 1iah has a chimeric structure where the n-terminal domain is very similar to domains of classical protein kinases whilst the c-terminal one is similar to domains of the atp-grasp fold. in that respect the 1iha structure makes a link between protein kinase and the atp-grasp folds, which explains why its atp-binding site was clustered together with those belonging to the atp-grasp fold. interestingly, the remote similarity between classical protein kinase folds and the atp-grasp fold had been noted previously and explained using the concept of either convergent  <cit>  or divergent  <cit>  evolution. we thus believe that the detected pattern is meaningful.

towards protein classification, function annotation & putative site discovery
possible applications of 3d patterns and motifs are protein classification, functional annotation and the discovery of putative binding sites. in order to evaluate the classification and annotation power of the patterns generated by our method, each of them was used to query all pdb proteins binding purine based ligands. the first targets were all the amp, adp and atp binding proteins. we then added proteins binding two very similar ligands: anp and acp. finally, we looked at quite a different family of ligands with three guanine based ligands: gmp, gdp and gtp. the total number of pdb entries per ligand as well as the search results are shown in table  <dig> 

during the search procedure those proteins whose similarity was higher than the automatic similarity threshold were classified as positive hits, see table  <dig>  for each of these proteins, its annotations, i.e. functions, ec numbers, fold classifications and sequence motifs, were compared manually with those of the pattern and/or of the proteins used to define the pattern. if there was an exact match, the protein was set as true positive; otherwise it was set as false positive. since this validation required human expertise, only the positive hits were analysed.

approximately 33% of adp and atp proteins and 15% of amp proteins matched the 3d patterns, see table  <dig>  these rates correspond to the percentage of binding sites in the pdb <dig> set, which were originally present in valid clusters when patterns were generated, see table  <dig>  the rate for atp proteins is, however, higher than expected because their binding sites often match patterns generated from adp clusters, see figure  <dig>  since physicochemical properties of anp and acp are very similar to adp, proteins binding these ligands were very well classified using motifs generated independently from their binding sites. the high percentage of hits against the patterns for acp binding sites is not significant because the acp sample is particularly small . as a whole, our 3d patterns matched 31% of proteins with adenine based ligands. since guanine and adenine molecules are chemically very different, proteins with guanine based ligands were not expected to be matched by our adenine patterns. in fact, only two hits were produced from more than  <dig> of these proteins. finally, the rate of false positive is very low .

these results were obtained using automatically generated similarity thresholds, which proved quite conservative. by setting these thresholds manually to optimise the number of proteins matched by each pattern, the number of adenine proteins matched was increased to 38% while maintaining a low rate of false positives .

although some patterns such as amp <dig>  axp <dig>  adp <dig> and atp <dig> mainly detect the very small number of proteins which were used to produce them, other patterns such as adp <dig>  adp <dig>  axp <dig> and axp <dig> are able to hit a large number of proteins with a low number of false positives. these 3d patterns, therefore, show good potential for protein annotation.

although dali would be a better function predictor on this dataset – 100% success rate -, it relies on a very dense sampling of the known protein structure space. indeed, the annotation of the  <dig> protein structures containing adenine based ligands required  <dig> different structure representatives, which correspond to  <dig> % of the number of structures to annotate. since our  <dig> 3d motifs contain only a combined total of  <dig> atom positions, there is a 100-fold difference between the amount of data stored to produce those predictions. this supports our claim that our motifs capture atom positions which are key to binding site activity.

since our method can be applied on any ligand containing some rigid structure, many other ligand families could be studied. 3d motifs could be generated, for example, from haem and chlorophyll groups, monosaccharides  and other common rigid ligands such as plp, fmn, pca and mes since they are present in many pdb entries.

CONCLUSIONS
we have presented a new metric which permits the classification of proteins according to the atomic environment of binding sites. the only constraint is that their ligands should contain some rigid structure so that they can be superimposed. by studying proteins binding adenine based ligands, we have demonstrated that the core of the generated clusters are biochemically meaningful and can be used to generate useful 3d motifs. we have shown that these motifs are efficient for protein classification and annotation since their false positive rate is low. in addition, they are quite ligand specific. since our method was able to rediscover a pattern in the case of adp <dig> revealing complex evolutionary links between two classes of proteins, we believe our technique could also be used to detect cases of convergent evolution.

in future work we plan to develop a software tool which would permit fast and efficient parsing of 3d protein structures to detect putative binding sites corresponding to our atom based 3d motifs.
