BACKGROUND
in many species, sexual selection, the varying competitive success of individuals for access to mates  <cit> , drives the evolution of exaggerated male displays or ornamental traits and female preference for such traits. the diopsid family of stalk-eyed flies exhibits a well documented and experimentally tractable example of an ornamental sexual trait  <cit> . males and females have eyes laterally displaced from the head capsule on 'eye-stalks'  <cit>  and the exaggeration of eye-stalks can be extreme with males having eyespans up to twice that of their body length  <cit> . sexual dimorphism for eyespan, with males having much greater eyespan than females, has evolved several times within the diopsidae  <cit> . sexually dimorphic stalk-eyed fly species, such as t. dalmanni , have become excellent model systems for the study of sexual selection due to the accumulation of evidence that exaggeration of male eyespan is driven by both female mate preference  <cit>  and male-male competition  <cit> .

little is known about the genetic and developmental mechanisms that generate variation in sexual ornaments. several approaches have been taken to identify potential candidate genes involved in eye-stalk development. comparative gene expression studies have established that early development of the head capsule in diopsids is essentially similar to that of the non-hypercephalic drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . qtl-based approaches have found micro-satellite polymorphisms correlated with increased eyespan  <cit> . expression profiling using microarray chips made from expressed sequence tag  libraries has identified a panel of genes associated with growth regulation, which are expressed in the developing head around the onset of metamorphosis  <cit> . these studies have demonstrated interesting correlations between gene expression patterns and morphology but functional assays are required to confirm causal relationships between candidate gene activity and eyespan. further progress in understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying the exaggeration of male eyespan requires the development of techniques for manipulating the in vivo function and expression of candidate gene products.

germline transformation and the insertion of foreign gene constructs into a genome are essential techniques for many manipulations of gene activity and function. the insertion of transgenes driven by stage and tissue specific promoters in single or binary systems allows the mis-expression or over-expression of any candidate gene, as well as the expression of altered forms of the gene product  <cit> . transgenesis facilitates stage and tissue-specific rnai-mediated gene knockdown  <cit> . in some species, germline transformation with appropriate constructs have been used to develop genome-wide enhancer trapping programmes to identify cis-regulatory elements and novel genes active in tissues of interest  <cit> . genome-wide screens have also generated new mutations with relevant phenotypes via insertional mutagenesis  <cit> .

insect transgenesis is mediated by class ii transposable elements. a construct containing the terminal inverted repeats of the transposon flanking the gene of interest is injected into embryos along with an exogenous source of transposase. this was first performed in d. melanogaster using the p-element  <cit> . due to p-element activity being restricted to drosophilid species it was a further  <dig> years until a successful germline transformation was performed in a non-drosophilid insect, ceratitis capitata, mediated by minos  <cit> . the pan-specific activity of minos and several other transposable elements, including mos <dig> of the tc1/mariner family  <cit> , hermes  <cit>  and piggybac  <cit>  has enabled stable germline transformations in a wide range of insect and invertebrate species  <cit> . this was aided by the development of pan-specific promoters, such as 3xp <dig> and tetr, combined with pan-specific reporters, such as egfp and dsred, which enable ready detection of transformation events regardless of the species  <cit> .

here we report the first stable germline transformation of the stalk-eyed fly, t. dalmanni. pcr-based excision assays were used to test the suitability of three potential transposable element vectors, piggybac, mos <dig> of the tc1/mariner family and minos. piggybac and minos showed activity in t. dalmanni embryos. germline transformation was then achieved using minos and the 3xp3-egfp construct. egfp fluorescence was detected in the offspring of injected embryos and chromosomal insertion of the transgene was confirmed by southern blot. in one line the insertion was stably inherited and x-linked while in others multiple copies of the insert were present, although inheritance of the transgenic phenotype did not follow the expected mendelian model.

RESULTS
germline transformation of t. dalmanni using pmi
transposon vector systems can possess restricted host ranges  <cit> . pcr-based excision assays were used to assay the embryonic activities of three potentially suitable vectors, piggybac, mariner and minos in t. dalmanni . excision was detected in the piggybac and the minos assays using both dna and mrna sources of transposase . there was no evidence of excision in the mos1/mariner assay .

we performed three rounds of micro-injections to investigate the possible use of minos for the construction of transgenic stalk-eyed flies. t. dalmanni eggs were co-injected with a donor plasmid containing the sequence for 3xp3-egfp flanked by the minos terminal inverted repeats  and capped minos transposase-encoding mrna. of  <dig> injected eggs,  <dig>  produced viable adults . survivorship of uninjected eggs was significantly higher than of those injected with dna/mrna in all three rounds  but the proportion of eggs producing viable adults in these controls  indicates that the fertility of egg-laying adults was low.

values are given for injected eggs with those for the corresponding controls  in brackets.

transposition and integration of transgene dna into the host germline was assayed by screening for egfp fluorescence in the g <dig> progeny of outcrossed g <dig>  individuals. in total, over  <dig> g <dig> individuals were screened . egfp fluorescence was detected in offspring derived from two g <dig> individuals, labelled  <dig> and  <dig>  giving an overall transformation efficiency of 4%. fly  <dig> was a product of the first series of injections and fly  <dig> of the third series. approximately 2%  screened offspring of fly  <dig> and 5%  of fly  <dig> were egfp positive. individual egfp positive g <dig> offspring of both founders were outcrossed to wild type flies from the wild-type stock to generate lines of transgenic offspring for expression analysis and molecular characterisation of the insertions. two lines were generated from founder  <dig>  and  <dig> from founder  <dig> .

transformation efficiency is given as the percentage of fertile g <dig> adults giving rise to transgene-expressing g <dig> offspring . transformation rate is given as the percentage of injected eggs that gave rise to transformants.

in all 3xp3-egfp lines, egfp expression was restricted to the larval anal pads . expression was detected in all three larval instars. no expression was visible during embryonic stages of development and dissection of pupae and adult flies revealed no detectable fluorescence in the eyes or any other structure at either stage. integration of the minos element into the host genome was confirmed by southern analysis . a single  <dig> bp fragment was detected in both lines of transgenic offspring of g <dig> founder  <dig>  indicating that a single insertion event had occurred in the parent fly. multiple bands larger than the minimum expected fragment size  were detected in offspring of founder  <dig>  the number and size of the bands was different in lines  derived from two different g <dig> individuals, suggesting multiple insertion events had occurred. flanking sequence for one of the insertions was obtained by two-step gene walking  <cit> . the characteristic ta duplication associated with minos mediated insertion was present  but the flanking region showed no significant homology with any sequences in the stalk-eyed fly est database  <cit>  or any d. melanogaster sequences.

sex-linkage and stability of one transgenic insertion
t. dalmanni possess a chromosomal mechanism for sex determination  <cit>  whereby females are the homogametic sex  and males are the heterogametic sex . x-linked insertions will therefore only be passed on to female offspring of a carrier male. g <dig> founder  <dig> produced two egfp positive offspring both of which were female and were used to establish lines . to test for sex linkage of the insert, g <dig> crosses were set up for each g1-derived line . carrier males were individually crossed with virgin wild-type females and virgin carrier females were individually crossed with wild-type males. in both lines the segregation of the transgene with sex was consistent with the presence of a single x-linked insertion. for crosses involving a carrier male and a wild-type female, all male offspring were egfp negative . by contrast, for crosses involving a carrier female, egfp positive progeny were equally distributed between the sexes . stock populations were set up using egfp-expressing  males and homozygous carrier females. transgene expression was detected in all individuals sampled for eight consecutive generations, confirming that the insertion is stable.

egfp positive g <dig> individuals  were individually crossed with wild-type  virgin flies of the opposite sex. results are given as total output of five crosses. *crosses involving egfp+ male flies, which did not produce any egfp positive male offspring

multiple insertions and evidence of transgene suppression
southern analysis indicated that multiple insertion events had occurred in g <dig> founder  <dig> and this was supported by segregation analysis suggesting independent insertions had occurred on the x and the autosomal chromosomes . founder  <dig> produced  <dig> g <dig> fertile, egfp positive offspring,  <dig> of which were male. x-linkage of the insert was observed in the offspring of  <dig> of the g <dig> males, male egfp positive g <dig> offspring being absent. for the other  <dig> g <dig> males, an autosomal pattern of inheritance was observed . in almost all g <dig> crosses a significantly smaller proportion of offspring expressed the transgene than would be predicted by a strictly mendelian model .

surviving fertile egfp positive g <dig> progeny of the g <dig> individual, fly  <dig>  were individually crossed with wild-type virgin flies of the opposite sex to generate g <dig> offspring. g <dig> offspring were screened for egfp fluorescence during the third larval instar and sex was recorded when individuals eclosed. not all g <dig> progeny were reared to adulthood. a single x-linked insertion in a male g <dig> carrier would lead to all female offspring being egfp positive and all males being egfp negative. autosomal insertions would be inherited by both female and male g <dig> offspring. *in four male derived sublines there was a significant sex bias among egfp positive offspring with egfp positive males being absent. both male and and female egfp positive offspring were produced by males  <dig>  and  <dig> .

§there was a significant deficit of egfp positive offspring in seven sublines.

previous studies which have observed non-mendelian transmission of multiple copy transgenes have shown that the reduced recovery of the transgenic phenotype was linked to transgene instability  <cit> . to assess whether a similar mechanism might account for the skewed recovery of egfp positive offspring, we set up a series of test crosses. five egfp negative g <dig> females which would have inherited the transgene carrying x chromosome from their male parent  were individually crossed with wild-type males. all egfp negative females produced egfp positive g <dig> offspring, although the proportion of egfp positive offspring  was significantly below 50% . this indicates that the transgene was still present in the egfp negative female parents but its expression had been suppressed by a subsequently reversible mechanism.

discussion
in this paper we describe the stable germline transformation of a stalk-eyed fly, t. dalmanni. previously, four transposon vectors have been used successfully in non-drosophilid insect transgenesis. we employed an in vivo excision assay to test for transposon activity in stalk-eyed fly embryos. no activity of the mos <dig> mariner transposon was detected. transformation efficiencies obtained with mariner based vectors are generally lower than those seen with minos or piggybac  <cit> . however, members of the mariner family have been detected in the several diopsid species, including t. dalmanni  <cit> . mos  <dig> transposon repression in this species could be due to self-inhibition of mariner activity by endogenous elements  <cit> . both piggybac and minos transposons showed activity in t. dalmanni embryos. we used minos in conjunction with a 3xp3-egfp marker construct for germline transformation.

the observed transformation rate of 4% among injected individuals is comparable to those commonly reported in insect transformation systems  <cit>  but the overall efficiency of the protocol was reduced by the low proportion of injected eggs giving rise to viable adults. in part this was probably due to trauma associated with the injection procedure but low fertility was also a factor. low fertilities have been documented for other laboratory and field populations of t. dalmanni and appear to be common among diopsids  <cit> . low survivorship and efficiencies have been reported in transformation protocols for other insect species, especially in initial transformations experiments, but these have not prevented further use of the protocol  <cit> .

the 3xp3-egfp construct was selected because its activity is pan-species specific and it has proved simple to detect in live larvae and adults. given that 3xp <dig> is based on the pax <dig> promoter it would be expected to drive egfp expression in the larval and adult eye and brain  <cit> . however, studies of dipterans have frequently reported expression in the anal pads or papillae  <cit> . here, in all t. dalmanni transformant lines, expression was restricted to the larval anal pads but not detected in the eyes or brains of larvae or adults. a similar pattern of larval expression was reported for 3xp3-egfp transgenic musca  <cit> , indicating that the eye/brain expression driven by this promoter is susceptible to position effect-based suppression  <cit> . the lack of adult eye expression in t. dalmanni is somewhat unusual. however previous dipteran studies used eye colour mutants  to identify transgenic founders and so would not have been able to recover insertions with purely larval expression. such eye colour mutants are not available in t. dalmanni.

in lines carrying multiple inserts, expression of the transgenic phenotype was detected in fewer than expected offspring. egfp negative individuals were able to produce egfp positive offspring, suggesting that, in this case, loss of expression was not solely due to transgene loss but, at least in part, to suppression of transgene activity  <cit> . a variety of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms that lead to transgene suppression have been described in the literature  <cit> . position effects and position effect variegation are also commonly observed in insects  <cit> . further experiments would be required to determine which, if any, of these mechanisms are in operation here.

in the lines established from one founder  a single 3xp3-egfp insertion was stable and x-linked. crosses between males hemizygous for this insert with wild-type females will result in all female, but no male, offspring expressing the transgene. this allows live male and female larvae to be distinguished unlike previous methods for sexing diopsid larvae which required the sacrifice of the individual  <cit> . from an evolutionary standpoint there is considerable interest in identifying and characterising the timing and level of expression of the genes on which selection acts to regulate eyespan in sexually dimorphic diopsid species such as t. dalmanni. one potentially powerful approach is to compare gene expression during the development and growth of the eye-stalks in males and females. the transgenic method enables groups of living male and female larvae to be independently cultured and manipulated. differential gene expression and development of the sexes can be assessed throughout larval and pupal development using microarrays or other high throughput approaches  <cit> .

the availability of an effective transgenic protocol enables multiple experimental approaches to be developed in stalk-eyed flies. these include over-expressing or knocking down candidate genes for developmental or other functions, morphological analysis and sperm competition assays  <cit> . est sequencing and microarray analysis of t. dalmanni eye-antennal imaginal discs has identified a number of candidate genes for effects on eye-stalk development including the cell cycle progression regulators, crooked leg  and cdc <dig>  <cit> . our establishment of a successful transgenic protocol makes functional analysis of such genes possible. several genes have been found for which variation in glutamine repeats is correlated with variation in eyespan including corto, tousled-like kinase , and ecdysone-induced protein 75b   <cit> . transgenics could be used to manipulate the number of glutamine repeats in order to study the effects on associated morphological traits  <cit> .

transgenic approaches would further benefit from the development of binary gal4-uas systems for targeted gene expression and to facilitate the analysis of constructs that would result in lethality or infertility  <cit> . such systems are well established in d. melanogaster and have recently become available in non-model systems, such as bombyx mori  <cit> . the constructs developed for non-drosophilids are piggybac-based but for some applications would benefit from having a second vector such as minos to supply a stable transgenic source of piggybac transposase. in this context, it is advantageous that we have shown that both minos and piggybac are active in t. dalmanni.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we describe the first transgenic protocol to be developed in t. dalmanni, a species that exhibits an ornamental sexual trait. stable germline transformation technology will facilitate a variety of experimental approaches with the potential to greatly enhance understanding of sexual selection in general and the evolution and development of exaggerated sexual traits in particular. the x-linked egfp-expressing insertion we have described allows live larval sexing. this can be combined with existing microarray-based methods for analysing differential gene expression in t. dalmanni  <cit>  in order to identify sex-specific candidate genes at key stages of larval and pupal development in diopsids.
