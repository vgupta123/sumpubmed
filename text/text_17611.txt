BACKGROUND
the origin of mangifera indica l. species which includes all commercial cultivars is still undetermined. the genus mangifera has approximately  <dig> members which are located mostly on the malay peninsula, in the indonesian archipelago, in thailand and in the philippines  <cit> . some of these species have edible fruit which are locally cultivated. mango cultivation began a few thousand years ago in india. it first spread from southeast asia, only several hundred years ago, with the portuguese and spaniards to africa, central and south america. in recent years mango has become common in most tropical and subtropical regions. india together with several other countries in southeast asia is the main growing and production center for mango. hundreds of known cultivars has been isolated in the last few hundred years in several mango growing countries, mainly in india, and in the pacific islands  <cit> . a secondary mango center flourished in florida during the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, and many new floridian cultivars were promoted  <cit> . these cultivars are adapted to the taste of the western consumer by breeding to a red blush coloration, mild taste and mild aroma idoetype. however, there is still some demand for cultivar improvement, and several breeding programs are active in australia, south africa, brazil and israel  <cit> .

germplasm collections are important for genotypic and phenotypic analyses, and as a genetic resource in breeding programs. knowledge of the diversity and the genetic structure of these collections is a fundamental for association studies and controlled breeding  <cit> . despite the mango economic importance, the available genetic and genomic resources for mango cannot support modern breeding or the study of the molecular mechanisms underlying mango’s physiology. a limited genetic map with very low resolution has been created for mango  <cit> . a few studies have attempted to decipher relationship among mango cultivar collections worldwide . twenty five floridian accessions from the usda collection were grouped into two clusters based on  <dig> random amplified polymorphic dna  markers  <cit> . one cluster was comprised of a group of floridian accessions that are closely related to the indian cultivar ‘mulgoba’ whereas the other cluster contained a group of more distant accessions. a sample from the floridian groups was also included in a work on the relationship of  <dig> mango accessions from the thai mango collection. the variability of the thai accessions was high and they were not distinguishable from the floridian accessions, apparently because most of them were seedlings  <cit> . the pakistanian collection mostly included indian-originated mango accessions. based on rapd analysis of  <dig> loci due to high diversity in mango, only the southern indian accessions could be separated from northern and eastern ones  <cit> . two other studies investigated the association between genetic diversity and geographical properties of accessions in india  <cit> . those studies weakly separated the northern and eastern accessions from the southern and western ones. a spanish research group showed that  <dig> simple-sequence repeats  can differentiate the floridian cultivars from the indian and the filipino ones in the  <dig> accessions of a spanish collection  <cit> .

recently, the genetic diversity of mangoes originated from andhra pradesh, the major mango breeding area in india, was studied based on  <dig> polymorphic ssrs. accessions of the same ideotype  were more related to each other but did not show any significant differentiation  <cit> . further support for the high diversity of mango came from a study of six colombian cultivar groups showing that the diversity within the six groups is as high as the diversity between them, which indicating very minor population divergence  <cit> . a broader survey of mango collection, including many geographical locations, was performed in australia with the caveat of a low number of markers   <cit> . the mangoes were successfully classified into five geographical origins however an attempt to classify the accessions by mono- or polyembryonic phenotype was unsuccessful.

molecular efforts to create wide genomic and genetic data for mango are in their initial stages. these efforts have included establishment of a leaf transcriptome  <cit>  and fruit transcriptomes at different developmental and ripening stages . next generation sequencing  technologies are excellent tools for genome-wide marker discovery and exposing genetic variation  <cit> . de novo transcriptome sequencing is one solution for marker discovery, gene expression analysis and exposing genetic variability in organisms with no genomic infrastructure such as olives, chinese chestnut, carrot and pomegranate . large scale sets of genetic markers can be used to establish genetic maps. these maps can then be utilized for plant breeding and be utilized for anchoring in de novo genome assemblies. moreover, studying the genetic variation of the germplasm collection can give insights into the historical basis of the diversity and can additionally be used for genome wide association studies in order to identify markers linked with important horticultural traits for plant breeding  <cit> .

in the present work we describe our effort to broaden the transcriptome resources for mango by sequencing rna from various tissues and fruit stages. using 454-gs flx titanium technology we reconstructed a large portion of the ‘keitt’ mango transcriptome and used it as a reference for aligning resequencing results. resequencing of the ‘keitt’ transcriptome itself as well as another mango accession,‘tommy atkins’, by illumina hiseq  <dig> was used to discover a large set of genetic variation. a subset of that variation was utilized in order to explore the israeli mango collection which comprises cultivars from several world regions.

RESULTS
genic variation is a very useful resource for marker assisted selection  and association studies. therefore rna samples of two mango accessions, ‘tommy atkins’ and ‘keitt’, were obtained from a pool of tissues  as a representative transcriptome . by pooling we expected to compensate for tissue-specific gene expression. variation discovery in the transcriptome was performed in two steps. first, de novo assembly of the whole transcriptome was performed by 454-gs flx titanium sequencing of ‘keitt’. second, resequencing of both mango cultivars, ‘tommy atkins’ and ‘keitt’, was aligned to ‘keitt’ de novo assembly contigs to obtain high coverage and therefore high accuracy of allele identification  <cit> .

assembly and annotation of the reference transcriptome
the sequencing of ‘keitt’ using 454-gs flx titanium was yielded  <dig> , <dig> reads. after filtering out low quality and empty reads, de novo assembly was performed on  <dig> , <dig> reads resulting in  <dig>  contigs. these contigs were then reassembled into super-contigs using the cap <dig> program  <cit> . ten percent of the contigs  were assembled into super-contigs most  of which comprised  <dig> to  <dig> contigs. altogether, the assembled ‘keitt’ transcriptome contained  <dig>  singleton contigs and super-contigs . we compared the results of the assembly in this work with two additional published assemblies that were based on a different sequencing strategy  <cit> . those transcriptomes were sequenced from rna samples of leaf   <cit>  and fruit peel   <cit>  tissues using illumina technology followed by de novo assembly of short reads. ninety percent of the contigs were  <dig>   <dig>  and 223 bp or longer and half were at least  <dig>   <dig>  438 bp long for pool, leaf and peel transcriptome assemblies respectively . both statistics suggested that the contigs of the pool transcriptome are twice as long as those of the leaf and peel transcriptome assemblies  <cit> . obviously, the novel pool transcriptome in this study significantly contributes to the length of available transcripts.fig.  <dig> distribution of contig lengths and comparison with two published mango transcriptomes. the distribution of contig lengths from three assemblies was plotted: leaf , peel , and pooled  of tissues. the distribution of consensus contig lengths is drawn as 100-bp long bins



functional annotation was also performed. first, the functional annotation of the pool transcriptome resulted in a successful list of  <dig>  hits  as a result of similarity searches against ‘gene bank’, ‘tair’, and ‘uniprot’ protein databases . second, by comparison to leaf and peel transcriptomes, we could investigate what are the common functionalities between leaves and fruit peel and assess whether novel transcriptome information was revealed in the pool transcriptome. a reciprocal blast was run between the pool and peel transcriptomes, and between pool and leaf transcriptomes. the best hits were taken as the homologous transcripts. the number of pool transcripts that were homologous to the peel transcripts only was  <dig>  whereas  <dig> pool transcripts were homologous to leaf transcripts only. the common subset of transcripts, i.e., the intersection of the peel, leaf, and pool transcriptomes, included  <dig> transcripts . half of the transcripts in the pool transcriptome  had no homolog in either the peel or leaf transcriptomes. the excess of transcripts in the pool transcriptome relative to the peel and leaf transcriptomes could reveal new functionalities. therefore a comparison of gene ontology  functional categories between the common subset of transcripts and the rest of the transcripts might reveal whether or not new functionalities have been rendered. figure  <dig> illustrates the distribution of go-slim categories in the pool transcriptome. in general, most of the go-slim categories existed in both subsets of the pool transcriptome. however, three transcripts related to cell communication category in the biological process ontology appeared exclusively in the pool transcriptome as were five other transcripts related to the extracellular space.table  <dig> number of mango contig homologous hits

transcriptome variation
ssrs and single-nucleotide polymorphisms  are highly useful in plant genetics and breeding for the construction of linkage maps and mas  <cit> . therefore, we focused on the repertoire of ssrs and snps in the mango transcriptome. the number of ssrs found in the transcriptome was  <dig>  the ssrs were discovered in 4 %  of all transcripts of the pool transcriptome . the lengths of the ssr motifs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  most of the ssrs are trinucleotides  followed by dinucleotide  . the most frequent dinucleotide motif was n with a frequency of  <dig> out of  <dig> followed by n, n, and n . the least frequent motifs  were n and n. the three most frequent trinucleotide motifs are n, n, and n with the proportions of  <dig>   <dig> and 10 % of all trinucleotide motifs, respectively . the novel ssrs, in this study, are expected to greatly enrich the mango community reservoir of ssrs that have already been reported  <cit> . the ssrs in those studies were used as a genetic tool to investigate diversity in local germplasm collections. in general, those studies were based on a few ssrs and the frequency of the ssr motifs in the genome was not reported. thus the ssr motifs could not be compared. however, the pattern of ssr motifs is known to be species-specific  <cit> . thus, a discovery of the same pattern of ssr motifs in the same species can strengthen the ssrs’ reliability. previously reported ssr motifs were congruent with the motifs that were reported here verifying their reliability. for example, a study of australian collection’s diversity identified  <dig> ssrs within approximately 24k expressed sequence tags   <cit> . the trinucleotide motifs were more frequent than dinucleotide motifs in both the australian collection in the present study. moreover, the motif patterns that were reported as the preponderant ones were congruent with our observations. the trinucleotide motif, n, was ranked as the most and second most frequent in the australian study and in our study, respectively, and the dinucleotide motif, n, was ranked as the most and third most frequent, respectively. the list of ssrs discovered might be useful for mas and genetic surveys. however, in spite of the fact that ngs can be used for ssr discovery, high-throughput technologies  are more available for snps  <cit> . therefore, in terms of parallel genotyping the available technologies tilt the balance in favor of using snps as markers rather than ssrs.fig.  <dig> ssr length and motif distribution. the number of mono- to hexanucleotide ssr motifs was counted . the nucleotide compositions of the most frequent motifs  were determined for each type and are illustrated in a bar plot for dinucleotide  and trinucleotide motifs . motifs that are reverse-complementary were plotted as stacked bars: “plus strand”  and “minus strand” 



in the recent years, with the evolution of next generation sequencing, many studies have developed snp markers for marker-assisted breeding . ngs has leveraged the genome-wide snp discovery in non-model organisms such as spruce  <cit> , apple  <cit> , and pomegranate  <cit> . however, no study of snp development for mango has been reported yet. in the present work, two mango accessions’ transcriptomes  were resequenced and aligned to a de-novo assembled transcriptome as a reference. the analysis resulted in the discovery of  <dig>  snps  using varscan  <cit> . the polymorphism type of those loci for the two accessions’ transcriptomes can be either polymorphic, i.e., heterozygous  or non-polymorphic, i.e., homozygous . the possible combinations of the genotype calls for the two transcriptomes fall into four categories: both transcriptomes are homozygous , ‘keitt’ is heterozygous and ‘tommy atkins’ is homozygous , ‘keitt’ is homozygous and ‘tommy atkins’ is heterozygous , and both transcriptomes are heterozygous . note that if both transcriptomes are homozygous, they are homozygous for different alleles. the distribution of snps into these categories was  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. thus ‘tommy atkins’ is more polymorphic than ‘keitt’. as expected more snps were discovered in the flanking regions of the open reading frames , than within them . the ratio of outorf to inorf snps was  <dig>  on the average. this ratio was uniformly maintained in all snp categories except in the hoho category where the ratio of outorf to inorf snps is two and it was found to be significantly smaller  than  <dig>  as a result of a slight increase of inorf snps. herein we described the first set of snp markers for mango. the closest fruit tree relative of mango with a published genome, citrus sinensis, is as polymorphic as mango  <cit> . the genome project of the sweet orange reported  <dig>  million snps in the entire genome with one-third are in genic regions  <cit> . like orange, 70 % of the transcripts included at least one snp while only 63 % included at least one snp in the exonic regions. other studies of fruit trees reported much less polymorphism in expressed regions:  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  in pomegranate  <cit> , apple  <cit> , and eucalyptus  <cit> , respectively. these findings confirm previous results that mango is a highly heterozygous  species  <cit> .

germplasm kinship
an overwhelming number of snps derived from the genic region of the genome may be useful in the future for genome-wide association studies . however as a preliminary step to such studies, a survey of the structure and diversity of the mango collection is required  <cit> . a subset of  <dig> high quality snps was used for genotyping  <dig> accessions of the israeli mango collection, one snp per contig. the snps subset was not biased toward “inorf” or “outorf” types of snps  and was therefore representative. as reported in previous studies of collections, mangoes are highly polymorphic  <cit> . the median polymorphism information content  was  <dig>  whereas less than 1 % of the applicable snps were of minor allele frequency  value < <dig> . thus most of the snps were polymorphic in the israeli mango collection although they were discovered in only two accessions, ‘keitt’ and ‘tommy atkins’. that is reasonable presuming that mango is highly polymorphic.

the israeli germplasm collection comprises cultivars that were originated from india, southeast asia, south america and the pacific islands, florida, australia, and from elite local hybrids. a dendrogram based on the proportion of shared alleles distance classified the accessions in the mango collection into two genetic subgroups. the dendrogram  split the mango collection into two major clusters: 1) a small one that comprises most of the indian accessions clustered together with accessions from southeast asia , 2) and a larger one which comprised of the floridian, south african, australian, local  and south american accessions . this division separates indian and southeast asian accessions from the rest. in other words, the mango accessions that are cultivated in the western part of the world can be genetically separated from those that are cultivated in its eastern part of the world. due to the fact that the origin of mango has been suggested to be from the eastern part of the world  <cit> , sp <dig> might be more related to the landrace mangoes. three accessions from india fell within the floridian-israeli  cluster. ‘mulgoba’ was reported as the parent of the floridian cultivar ‘haden’ and as a putative parent of other floridian variants  <cit> . moreover, ‘haden’ has been suggested to be the parent of many other floridian accessions  <cit> . thus, ‘mulgoba’ is the ancestor of most floridian accessions. recently a new study was published and reported about  <dig> mango accessions from all over india. in that study, the cultivar ‘suvarnarekha’ was reported from south india as was ‘mulgoba’ and they both were clustered together in a dendrogram by their geographical origin  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge no record exists of the origin and the genetic similarity of the third indian accession, ‘sendura’. moreover, the number of subpopulations estimated by evanno’s method  <cit>  was k =  <dig>  most of the accessions from india which were clustered together were genetically homogeneous , while the three accessions from india that were included in the cluster with the floridian and israeli accessions are highly admixed . ravishankar et al.  <cit>  showed that the indian collection can be divided into two subpopulations corresponding to the geographical classification of south/west and north/east. moreover, the south/west can be further divided into two sub-populations. it is not clear whether the additional genetic division is correlated with south and west geographical regions. however assuming this correlation would explain the fact that in the sp <dig> cluster, the indian accessions were from north, east, and two from west, while the indian accessions from the south were included separately in the sp <dig> cluster .fig.  <dig> dendrogram and genetic structure of  <dig> accessions in the israeli mango germplasm collection. genotyping of  <dig> mango accessions from the israeli mango collection was performed with  <dig> snps. the genotyping results were used to classify the accessions into sub-populations and reveal their genetic structure. a classification was performed by drawing a dendrogram based on 1- proportion of shared alleles  as a genetic distance. only confident branches with bootstrap values ≥ <dig> were assigned. the two major groups are notated as subpopulation  <dig>  and as subpopulation  <dig> . b genetic structure was revealed by structure program with k =  <dig> as found by simulation and Δk likelihood method. the division of structure’s q-value bar plot into two  corresponds to the two major significant clusters in the dendrogram. note that the y-axis  scale is between  <dig> and  <dig> and represents proportion



in contrast to the mango accessions’ origin, there was no clear division observed between poly- and monoembryonic accessions in the sp <dig> and sp <dig> clusters. sp <dig> comprised  <dig> and five mono- and polyembryonic accessions respectively . sp <dig> comprised  <dig> and  <dig> mono- and polyembryonic accessions respectively . no significant difference  was observed between the proportions of poly- and monoembryonic accessions in the two clusters.

mango diversity
the two major clusters in the dendrogram were compared for their genetic diversity. the expected heterozygosity of sp <dig>  is significantly smaller  than the expected heterozygosity of sp <dig> . the accessions in sp <dig> are in hardy-weinberg equilibrium  with a median fs of - <dig>  . in contrast, slight outbreeding was estimated for the accessions in sp <dig> with a median of fs = - <dig>  . both fs values were close to zero and slightly negative, suggesting that mango accessions in these clusters are not prone to inbreeding. the sp <dig> cluster that was enriched in accessions from southeast asia and india, i.e., suggested mango’s origin  <cit> , and its accessions had probably been under cultivation longer duration than the accessions in sp <dig>  therefore the result that they were in hwe is acceptable. in contrast the sp <dig> cluster deviated from the hwe. one explanation is that as a group, the accessions in the cluster as a group appeared to be under shorter duration of cultivation. alternatively, one might suggest that sp <dig> is comprised of accessions that are more related to landraces . the sp <dig> cluster comprises of accessions that were subjected to breeding efforts. this may be one of the reasons that sp <dig> is under hwe while sp <dig> deviates from it. a supportive evidence that sp <dig> is a young subpopulation lies in the estimation of a fst value that is only slightly greater than zero  which suggests that sp <dig> is only in the beginning of its differentiation. small fst values, such as the one shown in this study, were previously suggested by three other studies  <cit>  of the indian and colombian mango collections using ssr and rapd markers respectively. the sp <dig> cluster is also more diverse than the sp <dig> cluster. the genetic structure analysis  illustrated that accessions in the sp <dig> cluster have come from a narrow genetic background whereas the indian-originated accessions in the sp <dig> cluster are more admixed. an optional explanation for this might relate to the possibility that the founder of the sp <dig> subpopulation  was probably a hybrid of the two subpopulations described in ravishankar and colleagues’ study  <cit>  and therefore heterozygous.

finally, two non-indica species of the genus mangifera were included in this study ; they clustered together with sp <dig> subpopulation that contained mainly accessions that are cultivated in southeast asia and india. this supports the claim that the southeast asia and india is the origin of mangifera indica  <cit>  and that the accessions in sp <dig> are closer to landraces than the ones in sp <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we have established a sequence for the mango transcriptome from a pool of tissues. this transcriptome was not reconstructed to study expression but rather served as a reduction in complexity for variation discovery. it was used as a reference to align resequencing of two commercially important mango accessions, ‘keitt’ and ‘tommy atkins’, constituting a resource for genetic variation discovery. the annotation and the ssr motifs were congruent with the existing knowledge in the literature. the discovered snps established a large pool genetic variation in mango. a subset of this pool was shown to be applicable for studying diversity in the israeli mango collection and for dividing it into two subpopulations, i.e., two genetic groups. the sp <dig> cluster comprised a southeast asian and indian accessions and was suggested to arise from a narrow genetic background. yet it was found to be in hwe, probably due to a long duration of cultivation. in contrast the sp <dig> cluster comprised mainly accessions cultivated in the western world except for three indian accessions, one of which had been reported to be the ancestor of many floridian mangoes. the structure analysis based on the snp markers suggested that the three indian mango accessions are an admixture. consequently, most of the descendent cultivars are admixtures as well. in contrast to sp <dig> accessions, those in sp <dig> were not in hwe. we suggest that the different results are probably due to difference in duration of cultivation, although this was not strongly supported by the results. we believe that the novel set of snps is valuable for mango because that they have been polymorphic in the israeli mango collection and they enabled us to recapitulate the mango’s diversity.
