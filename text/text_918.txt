BACKGROUND
the number of functional release sites connecting two neurons critically contributes to decide the impact that the presynaptic neuron has on the firing probability of the postsynaptic neuron  <cit> . this synaptic connectivity varies from one, or zero for silent synapses, to many hundreds at specialized multi release site connections like the climbing fibre synapse in the cerebellum, the mossy fibre ca <dig> synapse in the hippocampus, or the calyx of held in the brainstem  <cit> . most intracortical connections have, however, fewer than ten release sites  <cit> . what determines these differences in connectivity between different types of neuronal connections, and how the connection specific connectivity is established during brain development, is largely unknown.

in the rat hippocampal ca <dig> region the average glutamatergic synaptic connectivity between ca <dig> and ca <dig> pyramidal cells increases with development  <cit> . during the first ten postnatal days the connectivity is either one  <cit> , or zero for the silent connections  <cit> , whereas it thereafter increases to, on average, about five in the adult stage  <cit> . in striking contrast to the establishment of multiple glutamatergic connectivity onto ca <dig> pyramidal cells over a prolonged developmental period, multiple γ-aminobutyric acid ergic connectivity onto ca <dig> pyramidal cells is established already during the first postnatal days  <cit> . moreover, although there is an increasing number of gabaergic synapses, the average degree of gabaergic connectivity remains unaltered into adulthood  <cit> . these findings indicate that newly formed glutamatergic connections are restricted to one release site, whereas such restriction is lacking for newly formed gabaergic connections. these conclusions have been obtained by comparing the average amplitude of spontaneous action potential dependent postsynaptic currents , to that of action potential independent pscs . this amplitude ratio is referred to as multiplicity  <cit> , and if each presynaptic cell forms at most one synaptic contact with the postsynaptic cell the multiplicity will be  <dig>  if, on the other hand, each presynaptic cell forms more than one synaptic contact with the postsynaptic cell the multiplicity will be >  <dig>  since the spscs will, on average, have a larger amplitude than the mpscs. if the release probability is also taken into account it is possible to convert multiplicity to connectivity. studies in the ca <dig> and ca <dig> region have shown good resemblance between electrophysiological and morphological estimates of connectivity  <cit> .

together these studies suggest that the mechanisms governing average connectivity between ca3-ca <dig> glutamatergic neurons and those governing average connectivity between gabaergic interneurons-ca <dig> glutamatergic neurons are fundamentally different, implying that the type of presynaptic neuron critically contributes to the connectivity properties. it is likely that the type of postsynaptic neuron is also important in deciding connectivity. previous studies in the ca <dig> region, and of ca <dig> stratum oriens interneurons, have indicated that glutamatergic synaptic connectivity onto gabaergic interneurons may be lower than that onto pyramidal cells  <cit> , whereas gabaergic connectivity onto gabaergic interneurons has not been examined. in the present study we have used the multiplicity approach to examine the development of glutamatergic and gabaergic connectivity onto stratum radiatum interneurons. together with previous studies we conclude that gabaergic interneurons in stratum radiatum and pyramidal cells differ with respect to the development of glutamatergic connectivity, but exhibit similar development of gabaergic connectivity.

RESULTS
connectivity at ca3-ca <dig> pyramidal cell connections
previous studies have shown that the average magnitude of spontaneous ampa epscs in the presence of ttx  and in the absence of ttx  is the same in developing  rat ca <dig> pyramidal cells  <cit> . in contrast, in mature ca <dig> pyramidal cells the magnitude of action potential dependent ampa sepscs is about two times larger than that of the ampa mepscs  <cit> . we first wanted to confirm these previous findings. figure 1a <dig> shows a typical recording from one pyramidal cell from a young adult  rat before and after application of ttx . consistent with the findings of hsia et al  <cit> , the reduction in frequency induced by ttx  was associated with a reduction in the amplitude of ampa epscs . multiplicity calculations  showed that the amplitude of action potential dependent ampa sepscs was on average  <dig>  ±  <dig>  times larger than the ampa mepsc amplitude .

connectivity at gabaergic interneuron - pyramidal cell connections
in contrast to the gradual establishment of ampa epsc multiplicity onto pyramidal cells during development  <cit> , gabaergic synapses onto pyramidal cells showed a high and developmentally stable multiplicity  <cit> . consistent with that study, we found that ipsc amplitude and frequency were reduced in pyramidal cells from young adult  animals after ttx was washed in . the multiplicity was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , thus comparable to what has previously been reported  <cit> .

connectivity at pyramidal cell - ca <dig> interneuron in stratum radiatum connections
we next recorded ampa sepscs and mepscs in interneurons in stratum radiatum from developing  and young adult  interneurons . in the developing group the average amplitude reduction was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pa  and the average reduction in frequency was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hz  and in frequency by  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hz  interneurons are highly diverse and the large observed variance in amplitude and frequency  might in part be explained by this. interestingly, despite this interneuron heterogeneity, the variability in multiplicity is very small in both age groups. further, we found no significant deviation from a multiplicity of one at glutamatergic connections onto these interneurons, neither from developing nor from young adult rats . the result from the older group  is thus in marked contrast to, and significantly different  from, the result from the pyramidal cells  of the same age. a possible explanation for this finding would be if glutamate synapses onto interneurons in stratum radiatum have a substantially lower release probability than those onto ca <dig> pyramidal cells. previous studies have, however, shown that these groups of synapses, on average, exhibit similar release probabilities  <cit> . to get an estimate of the average release probability in glutamatergic synapses onto interneurons in stratum radiatum, under our conditions of high ca2+ and low mg2+, we calculated paired-pulse ratios . the average ppr was  <dig>  +  <dig> /-  <dig>  , which is comparable to that obtained from pyramidal cells under the same conditions . this similarity in ppr values  indicates that the absence of multiplicity at glutamatergic connections onto these interneurons is not because of low average pr.

connectivity at gabaergic interneuron - interneuron in stratum radiatum connections
the findings from this study are summarized in figure 4a. one-way anova with the bonferroni post hoc test shows that the multiplicity at glutamatergic synapses onto both age groups of interneurons in stratum radiatum is significantly lower than the multiplicity at glutamatergic synapses onto pyramidal cells . there are, on the other hand, no significant differences between the three different groups of data from gabaergic synapses .

discussion
in this study, using the multiplicity method  <cit> , we have compared the development of average glutamatergic and gabaergic synaptic connectivity onto interneurons in stratum radiatum with that found previously onto ca <dig> pyramidal cells  <cit> . we found that the interneurons in stratum radiatum receive synaptic inputs with an average multiplicity higher than one from presynaptic gabaergic neurons . in agreement with what was previously found for the gabaergic innervation of the ca <dig> pyramidal cells   <cit> , this multiple connectivity existed already from the early postnatal development. in contrast, the development of the glutamatergic connectivity at the interneurons differed markedly from that previously found at the ca <dig> pyramidal cells. thus, our results suggest that an average connectivity corresponding to one functional single release site persists into adulthood onto interneurons in stratum radiatum , whereas it develops to multi-release site connections onto pyramidal cells  <cit>  . the conclusions from the present study, together with previous studies using the multiplicity method, are schematically summarized in figure 4b. collectively these studies suggest that the development of synaptic connectivity in this region follow neuron-specific rules with instructive signals from both pre- and postsynaptic elements. the importance of the presynaptic phenotype is illustrated by the difference in development of gabaergic and glutamatergic connectivity onto the same postsynaptic neurons. the importance of the postsynaptic phenotype is illustrated by the divergent development of connectivity between glutamatergic neurons and gabaergic or glutamatergic neurons, respectively. this differential control of average connectivity may be useful in future studies examining molecular mechanisms governing the degree of connectivity between neurons.

structural basis for multiplicity
the multiplicity approach, used in the present study to determine connectivity, has several limitations. first, it provides an average estimate and does not reveal the heterogeneity in number of connections between cell pairs. second, we have recorded from interneurons with their somata in the stratum radiatum. this selection more likely includes cck-positive schaffer-collateral associated and apical dendrite innervating interneurons, than for instance parvalbumin-positive interneurons  <cit> . it is thus possible that there are other gabaergic interneurons with connectivity patterns that depart from that described here. indeed, glutamatergic neurons can form multiple connections onto interneurons in ca <dig> strata oriens-alveus  <cit> . moreover, since the population of presynaptic gabaergic neurons, in contrast to the population of presynaptic glutamatergic neurons, is diverse in for example spiking properties, certain types of gabaergic interneurons may contribute disproportionally to the average multiplicity. third, there are reasons to assume that somatic whole cell recordings of spontaneous synaptic currents fail to detect distal, electrotonically remote, events  <cit> . thus, results obtained by the multiplicity method may be preferentially relevant for proximal synapses. fourth, a major unanswered question in the present study is the structural basis for the multiplicity. one can envisage three different scenarios: i/a single release site synapse that allows multivesicular release to increase transmitter concentration at the same set of postsynaptic receptors; ii/a multi release site synapse where released transmitter acts on independent sets of postsynaptic receptors; iii/several morphologically distinct single release site synapses. for gabaergic connections there is morphological evidence that a single axon can form several distributed synaptic connections onto the same postsynaptic neuron  <cit> . distributed glutamatergic connectivity has been shown in the neocortex  <cit> , and may also occur between the schaffer collaterals and pyramidal cells  <cit> . thus, morphologically distributed synapses is a possible explanation for multiple connectivity. on the other hand, there is electrophysiological evidence indicating that, at least under conditions of high release probability, gaba synapses  <cit>  and glutamate synapses  <cit>  onto mature ca <dig> pyramidal cells are capable of multivesicular release. in contrast to these findings in mature ca3-ca <dig> glutamate synapses, electrophysiological studies of developing  ca3-ca <dig> synapses have shown that these connections have univesicular release  <cit> . for glutamate synapses the issue of multi- versus univesicular release is complicated by whether ampa or nmda receptors are used as reporters in electrophysiological studies  <cit> . this is because nmda receptors have a higher affinity for glutamate, and thus are more likely to respond to intrasynaptic spillover than ampa receptors. a possible morphological correlate for the development from single release site to multi-release site glutamate synapses is the progressive development from shaft and thin spine synapses to stubby and mushroom synapses  <cit> . this spine development is largely consistent with multiplicity development  <cit> . the absence of spines on most gabaergic interneurons in stratum radiatum of the hippocampus also supports the idea that spines in gabaergic interneurons reflect multiple glutamatergic innervation.

development of multi release site connections
a key difference between glutamatergic and gabaergic synaptic connections is that gabaergic connections appear to form as multiple contacts  <cit>  , whereas glutamatergic connections are formed as single release site connections and may, on principal neurons, attain multiple connectivity later in development.

the single release site connectivity for glutamatergic connections in the ca <dig> region is largely preserved throughout development and into adulthood onto interneurons, but is progressively complemented by multi release site connections onto pyramidal cells. what governs this development towards multi release site glutamatergic connections is not known. one attractive hypothesis is that it reflects learning based synaptic strengthening, since it is generally thought that the ultimate consequence of associative long-term potentiation  is an increase in connectivity  <cit> . a corollary of this hypothesis is that ltp early in development, and ltp at interneuronal glutamate synapses, do not result in increased connectivity.

in fact, there are several results arguing that ltp at glutamatergic synapses onto interneurons is mechanistically distinct from that at mature glutamatergic synapses onto pyramidal cells. two major distinct types of glutamate synapses onto interneurons have been described; those with calcium permeable ampa receptors and few, or no, nmda receptors and those with calcium impermeable ampa receptors and abundant nmda receptors  <cit> . the induction of ltp at the first type of synapse is nmda receptor independent, but relies on metabotropic glutamate receptors  and calcium permeable ampa receptors and appears to be expressed as an increase in release probability  <cit> . the induction of ltp at the second type of synapse is nmda receptor dependent, is not associated with an accompanying change in paired-pulse ratio  <cit> , and may well involve unsilencing of ampa silent synapses, which are frequent at mature interneurons  <cit> , but largely absent in mature pyramidal cells  <cit> . thus, at both types of glutamatergic synapses onto interneurons, ltp appears to potentiate without increasing the number of functional release sites.

CONCLUSIONS
glutamate and gaba synaptic connectivity in the hippocampal ca <dig> region develop very differently, not only onto pyramidal cells, but also onto interneurons in stratum radiatum . thus, whereas average gaba connectivity is multiple throughout the development, glutamate connectivity is unitary early in development. our results further suggest that the development of glutamate synaptic connectivity differs markedly between pyramidal cells and gabaergic interneurons in stratum radiatum, such that a given presynaptic ca <dig> pyramidal cell appears not allowed to increase its connectivity onto the postsynaptic interneuron in stratum radiatum, as it may do onto the postsynaptic ca <dig> pyramidal cell.
