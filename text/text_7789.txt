BACKGROUND
brucella species bacteria are gram negative alpha proteobacteria superbly adapted for survival in intracellular environments. they infect a wide range of mammals, including essentially all economically important domestic mammals, many wild species, and humans. brucellosis is the largest bacterial zoonosis in the world  <cit> . in humans, untreated brucellosis is a long lasting disease characterized by recurrent fever episodes and clinical manifestations that include spondylitis, severe headaches, joint or abdominal pain, endocarditis, and meningoencephalitis. in severe non-treated cases brucellosis can cause death  <cit> .

seven terrestrial brucella species have been defined: brucella melitensis, brucella abortus, brucella suis, brucella ovis, brucella canis, brucella neotomae and brucella microti which infect goats, cattle, pigs, sheep, dogs, desert wood rats and common voles, respectively  <cit> . two brucella species infecting marine mammals such as dolphins, whales, seals, sea lions and walrus have also been defined as brucella ceti and brucella pinnipedialis  <cit> . with the exception of b. suis biovar  <dig>  the brucella genome is encoded on two chromosomes, containing in total approximately  <dig>  genes. genome sequences from  <dig> different brucella strains, representing all species, have been published either as complete genomes  or as draft assemblies in ncbi   <cit> . the raw genome sequencing data of  <dig> other strains is also available in the sequence read archive of ncbi. the genome sequences were very highly homologous, although regions of unique genetic material were also observed. it is possible that these regions are involved in establishing the distinct host preferences and biological behavior of the different brucella species sequenced to date  <cit> .

unlike other pathogenic bacteria, brucella virulence does not appear to be the result of relatively few virulence genes that can be transferred horizontally via plasmids, phages, or assembled in pathogenicity islands. brucella also lack typical virulence factors such as exotoxins, flagella, capsules, and type iii secretion systems. rather, the pathogen's virulence appears to be an integrated aspect of its physiology. therefore, to better understand brucella virulence, we will need to better understand the brucella proteome, including how it changes during the different stages of the intracellular and extracellular brucella lifecycles, and how it interacts with host proteins and processes. indeed, we have previously demonstrated that brucella bacteria are capable of extensive, reversible, remodeling of their cell envelopes  <cit> . furthermore, during the establishment of an intracellular infection, brucella bacteria also appear able to carry out extensive, and reversible, modifications to their biosynthetic pathways and respiration in order to adapt to the changing microenvironments encountered in infected host cells  <cit> . this suggests that the brucella proteome is considerably more dynamic than previously suspected, and that in depth proteomic analysis of the pathogen, as well as integration of these data with the available genomic information, will result in novel mechanistic and possibly therapeutic insights.

in this work we have generated a synthesis of the proteomic datasets we produced from multiple independent comparisons of brucella strains either grown in media or retrieved from infected host cells. some of this data is currently publicly available  with the remainder becoming available as part of this work. these studies were originally designed to identify experimental condition-specific differences in the brucella proteome. we compiled the experimental evidence for any brucella protein detected and compared the proteomic data to the available genomic data. we provide the first direct experimental evidence for the expression of  <dig> brucella proteins, but also identified experimental evidence for the expression of five genes previously annotated as pseudogenes, and of start site errors in two other genes.

RESULTS
first experimental evidence of the expression of  <dig> proteins in b. abortus 2308
samples used for the proteomic analysis came from b. abortus either grown extracellularly in media or isolated from infected raw <dig>  macrophages. the extracellular samples included whole bacteria grown directly in tryptic soy broth, outer membrane preparations   <cit>  and cytosols. intracellular samples consisted of viable b. abortus isolated at different time points post-infection from raw <dig>  macrophages  <cit>  and of phagosomes isolated from infected murine phagocytic cells. we obtained  <dig> peptides representing  <dig> different proteins, corresponding to approximately 20% of the predicted proteome. for  <dig> proteins, we are reporting the first experimental evidence of their expression in b. abortus  <dig> . we also report genome annotation errors for two proteins, expression of orfs annotated pseudogenes for four proteins and one correction to the sequence of another previously annotated pseudogene which allows for its full length expression. peptide sequences corresponding to these  <dig> proteins are listed in additional file  <dig>  the peptide coverage for the  <dig> newly demonstrated proteins varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  with an average of three peptides per protein. in order to confirm the expression of proteins identified by a single peptide, we manually validated all msms spectra that had a sequence assignment score smaller than  <dig>  forty-four of the  <dig> proteins were described previously as hypothetical with no putative function. when subcellular localizations were predicted using three publicly available tools  <cit> ,  <dig> proteins were predicted to be cytosolic, ten were inner membrane proteins,  <dig> were periplasmic, three were outer membrane proteins and the localization of  <dig> proteins could not be predicted . experimental evidence for the expression of the other  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins has been demonstrated previously by our group  <cit>  and others  <cit> . it is important to note that we are reporting an analysis of the combined results of several independent experiments using the same bacterial strain and technology to acquire the data. however, each experiment was a separate comparative study designed to identify differentially expressed bacterial proteins under specific conditions per experiment. proteins that were not sufficiently differentially expressed under the experimental conditions used would have not been identified. thus, while our results can be used to confirm that the proteins reported were expressed, they may underestimate under what conditions they can become expressed.

locus tags and descriptions of proteins are indicated and proteins are organized by predicted subcellular localization.

correction of five pseudogene annotations
in previous studies using b. abortus  <dig>  we used the genome databases available on ncbi for b. abortus, b. melitensis and b. suis for protein identification. more than once, we obtained peptides which matched proteins supposedly expressed only by the latter two species. upon verification, those peptides were manually assigned to orfs of previously annotated pseudogenes of b. abortus strain  <dig> . we therefore assembled a custom protein database which included the predicted translation sequence of all b. abortus  <dig> orfs annotated as pseudogenes. using this database, we were able to confirm the protein expression of five of these orfs : bab1_ <dig>  bab1_ <dig>  bab1_ <dig>  bab1_ <dig> and bab2_ <dig>  the msms spectra of the  <dig> peptides representing these former pseudogenes were manually validated. we thus investigated the reasons for which these genes had been annotated as pseudogenes. the genomic sequence of the cytoplasmic protein with a conserved duf  <dig> domain bab1_ <dig> was found to be identical to bmei <dig>  its b. melitensis counterpart. apart from the short length of this protein, there was no apparent reason for its pseudogene annotation . for bab1_ <dig> and bab1_ <dig> , the nucleotidic sequence was 99% identical to their bmei <dig> and bmei <dig> counterparts, leading to two cytoplasmic b. abortus  <dig> dihydroxyacetone kinases involved in glycerolipid metabolism that are 98% and 100% identical to the b. melitensis proteins, respectively. the case of bab2_ <dig>  which seems to be a 3-hydroxybutyryl-coa dehydrogenase, was more complex and confusing, having a single nucleotide deletion when compared to b. melitensis. this deletion would lead to the silencing of the stop codon which creates two separate proteins in b. melitensis, bmeii <dig> and bmeii <dig>  in b. abortus  <dig>  a fusion of the two genes would generate a much larger protein. however, the start codon in the corresponding orf of vaccine b. abortus s <dig>  is different from bmeii <dig>  and even more different from the start codon and carboxyl terminal sequence of the counterparts in b. suis , b. ovis , b. canis  and b. ceti . as a consequence, the lengths of b. abortus and b. melitensis proteins differ considerably from those of other brucella. since the bab2_ <dig> peptide that we found is located in the n-terminal section of the protein , we are able to confirm the expression of this originally annotated pseudogene, but were unable to confirm the expression of the full length protein.

the sequence of the bab1_ <dig> pseudogene was found to be misannotated in b. abortus  <dig>  the peptide sequence "tagygvggaalgalaggaiggngr" could not be found in the b. abortus  <dig> nucleotide-derived proteome but matched the b. melitensis locus tag bmei <dig>  in fact, except for  <dig> nucleotide, the corresponding  <dig> genomic sequence is identical to that of bmei <dig> . in b. abortus  <dig>  a single nucleotide insertion in bab1_ <dig> modifies the reading frame, hence its original annotation as a pseudogene. the manually validated peptide matches b. abortus  <dig> only when the additional nucleotide is removed, indicating that the sequence for locus bab1_ <dig> should be corrected . also to note is the earlier start site in b. abortus  <dig>  and all other species sequenced to date, when compared to b. melitensis  <dig> m. we believe that the b. abortus  <dig> start site was correctly assigned in the publicly available genome given the clear presence of a ribosome binding site in position - <dig> of the b. abortus sequence.

correction of two start site annotations errors
another type of annotation error identified in our studies was the erroneous assignment of gene translation start sites. for  <dig> proteins of b. abortus  <dig>  we report the expression of manually validated peptides corresponding to the sequence found upstream of their currently annotated start sites . the peptide sequence "mniheyqak" was first found to match the cytoplasmic b. melitensis succinyl-coa synthetase subunit beta protein  and then assigned manually to bab1_ <dig>  sequence comparison with other brucella species and strains shows that the b. abortus  <dig> protein start site is not shared with any of the subject sequences . in fact, all homologues of this protein in other brucella strains or species share the same start site, which is found  <dig> amino acids upstream of the b. abortus  <dig> site. moreover, a ribosome binding site can clearly be mapped to position - <dig> of the proposed new translation start site. we therefore believe this new start site to be accurate.

the second peptide, "tdllpimk", was found to match the cytoplasmic b. melitensis keto-hydroxyglutarate-aldolase  and then assigned to bab2_ <dig> in b. abortus  <dig>  this peptide overlaps the region upstream to the currently annotated translation start site and the first three amino acids based on the annotated translation start site . alignment of the current b. abortus  <dig> protein sequence with its counterparts in other brucella strains and species indicates that the  <dig> protein sequence is falsely truncated. other start sites lead to proteins having n-terminals longer by  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> amino acids. although we cannot clearly indicate the actual start site of bab1_ <dig> or bab2_ <dig>  we can confirm that their n-terminals are longer than currently annotated. based on the homology of the b. abortus  <dig> genome being highest with that of other b. abortus strains, one can speculate that the start sites would be identical to those mapped in these strains.

operons
since genes that are part of an operon are usually co-transcribed, it is possible that these genes might also be co-translated  <cit> . considering all proteins identified by our studies, we were able to almost fully reconstitute one of the two ribosomal rna operons, with all but bab1_ <dig> found. additionally, the previously mentioned bab1_ <dig> and bab1_ <dig> genes are predicted to be part of an operon containing  <dig> genes, bab1_ <dig> to bab1_ <dig> http://www.microbesonline.org/operons/gnc <dig> html. four of these proteins were detected in our studies, although only bab1_ <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> were found in the same experimental condition.

CONCLUSIONS
mass spectrometry has proven to be a valuable tool to identify and correct genomic annotation errors in the study of microorganisms  <cit> . we performed a proteomics analysis of b. abortus  <dig> proteins expressed upon extracellular and intracellular growth conditions to validate existing gene predictions at the protein level, to acquire useful information on b. abortus  <dig> expressed proteins and to identify and correct inaccurately annotated orfs. we were able to confirm the expression of over  <dig> previously unreported proteins and five pseudogenes, and corrected two wrongly assigned translation start sites. taken together, these findings further demonstrate that computational genomic annotation errors can be corrected using proteomics. this will lead to improved databases and thus better protein identification and functional annotation.
