BACKGROUND
shewanella species, which are affiliated with the class gammaproteobacteria, are widely distributed in nature, including marine, freshwater, sedimentary, and soil environments  <cit> . members of this genus are able to respire various organic and inorganic compounds , as well as soluble and solid metals   <cit> . in recent years, a few shewanella species have attracted considerable attention due to their potential applicability for bioremediation  <cit>  and bioelectrochemical systems , such as microbial fuel cells  and microbial electrosynthesis cells  <cit> .

shewanella oneidensis mr- <dig> is the most extensively studied strain in the genus shewanella because of its metabolic versatility  <cit> , annotated genome sequence  <cit> , and ease of genetic manipulation  <cit> . in addition, since it was shown in  <dig> that strain mr- <dig> has the ability to transfer electrons to an extracellular electrode without exogenously added mediator  <cit> , it has served as a model bacterium for studying microbial current generation and extracellular electron transfer  pathways  <cit> . these studies have revealed that mr- <dig> cells have multiple eet pathways, including direct eet pathways that involve outer-membrane cytochromes   <cit>  and electrically conductive pilus-like structures   <cit> , and indirect eet pathways that function via self-produced electron shuttle compounds, such as flavins  <cit> .

despite these studies, a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of eet is required to optimize and enhance microbial electron transfer rates in bess because studies in s. oneidensis mr- <dig> have also indicated that eet is a complex process that is influenced by various intracellular and extracellular components. saffarini et al.  <cit>  and charania et al.  <cit>  have revealed that cyclic amp  and camp receptor proteins are necessary for the expression of om-cyts. in addition, covington et al.  <cit>  identified the usha gene, which is involved in flavin secretion in mr- <dig>  our previous studies have also suggested the possibility that extracellular components, including cell-surface polysaccharides , are involved in eet and current generation in bess  <cit> . it is therefore conceivable that many unknown factors are also involved in eet.

a useful approach for identifying unknown cellular components  associated with a particular phenotype involves the construction and screening of random mutant libraries for mutants with altered phenotypes. we previously succeeded in isolating mr- <dig> mutants with increased current-generating activities from a transposon  insertion mutant library that was cultured under electrode-respiring conditions  <cit> . notably, the obtained mutants had an altered  colony morphology on agar plates  <cit> , indicating that the electrochemical cultivation and subsequent screening on agar plates of random tn insertion mutants is a useful approach for isolating current-generating mutants. although our previous studies have identified several genes related to cell-surface morphology and current generation  <cit> , it is reasonable to speculate that many other unknown factors remain to be identified, considering the complexity of bacterial cell-surface structures and eet processes.

in the present study, we screened mr- <dig> mutants from a random tn insertion library for altered colony morphology on agar plates after selection in electrochemical cells , to identify mutants with enhanced current-generating capability. one of the isolated mutants, designated strain ec- <dig>  formed extraordinary large colonies on agar plates and generated higher electric current in an ec than wild-type  mr- <dig>  analyses of strain ec- <dig> revealed that a number of genes, including those involved in cps synthesis and biofilm formation, were differentially expressed compared to wt, suggesting that these genes were associated with the distinct phenotype of this mutant.

RESULTS
electrochemcial selection of mutants
a library of s. oneidensis mr- <dig> random transposon mutants was introduced into an ec reactor equipped with a working electrode poised at + <dig>  v  and cultivated under electrode-respiring conditions. a current versus time curve generated during the electrochemical cultivation of mr- <dig> is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  after 40-days of electrochemical cultivation, the electrolyte was sampled spread on agar plates for the isolation of mutant cells. we found that approximately 20% of colonies formed by the electrochemically cultivated mutants were larger than those of wt mr- <dig>  suggesting that the mutants with large-colony morphology grew preferentially under the electrode-respiring conditions.

one of the isolated mutants, designated strain ec- <dig>  was clearly distinct from the other mutants and wt strains as it formed an extraordinary large colony . we previously found that a cps-deficient mutant of mr- <dig>  ∆so_ <dig>  formed large, flat, and rough colonies on agar plates, and generated higher power output in mfcs compared to that of wt  <cit> , indicating an association between cell-surface morphology and current generation. strain ec- <dig> also exhibited a rough, flat colony morphology, but formed larger colonies than those of ∆so_ <dig> . strain ec- <dig> was therefore selected for further characterization, including genetic analyses, to determine the identity and function of the mutated gene in this mutant.

evaluation of strain ec- <dig> in mfc
the ability of strain ec- <dig> to generate electrical power in an mfc was analyzed and compared with that of wt . to evaluate mfc performance, polarization  and power  curves were determined for each mfc after the current generation became stable . the pmax and isc for the ec- <dig> mfc  were approximately  <dig> -fold higher than those for the wt mfc .

in the single-chamber mfc used in this study, shewanella cells were localized to either the electrolyte as planktonic cells, or to the anode and cathode, where they formed biofilms. for strain ec- <dig>  the turbidity of the mfc electrolyte was markedly lower than that in the wt mfc , suggesting that more mutant cells were attached to the electrodes. to examine this hypothesis, wt and ec- <dig> cells from the electrolyte and electrodes of each mfc were collected after approximately 360 h of operation, and the protein contents in these samples were measured to estimate cell concentration . in the ec- <dig> mfc, the amount of cells attached to the graphite felt anode  was 140% higher than that of wt cells , whereas the amount of ec- <dig> cells in the electrolyte  was 74% lower than that of wt cells . the total protein contents, which represented the sums of the protein contents in the three mfc areas, did not significantly differ between the two strains. together, these results indicate that strain ec- <dig> has the increased ability to adhere to the graphite felt anode when cultivated under electrode-respiring conditions.

identification of the tn-insertion site in strain ec-2
pcr analysis of strain ec- <dig> revealed that a tn was inserted into the so_ <dig> gene, whose deduced amino acid sequence showed a significant homology  to the dna-binding response regulator uvry of escherichia coli. in e. coli, uvry is part of the bara/uvry two-component regulatory system  <cit> , which regulates the csr  system via transcriptional activation of csrb, a small noncoding rna  <cit> . it has been reported that the bara/uvry/csr regulatory cascade in e. coli is involved in the regulation of numerous physiological functions, including carbon metabolism, motility, adhesion, and biofilm formation  <cit> . recent studies also revealed that the bara/uvry/csr regulatory cascade is conserved in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  and that so_ <dig>  is involved in the transcriptional regulation of more than  <dig> genes, including those involved in cps biosynthesis genes  <cit>  and biofilm formation  <cit> . however, the roles of so_ <dig> in eet and current generation have not yet been investigated.

deletion of the so_ <dig> gene
to confirm that disruption of the so_ <dig> gene was responsible for the distinct morphotype and enhanced current generation by strain ec- <dig>  an in-frame deletion mutant of so_ <dig>  was constructed. when cultivated on lb plates, ∆so_ <dig> displayed a slightly rough colony morphotype as compared with wt . however, colonies formed by ∆so_ <dig> were similar in size to those of wt, and smaller than those of strain ec- <dig>  as colony morphology is influenced by cell surface structures and physicochemical properties  <cit> , we next evaluated cell surface hydrophobicity of wt, ec- <dig>  and ∆so_ <dig> by measuring the affinity of cells to hexadecane . the ec- <dig> and ∆so_ <dig> mutants were more hydrophobic than wt, but the hydrophobicity of ∆so_ <dig> was lower than that of ec- <dig>  these results were consistent with the rough colony appearance of both mutant strains.

current generation by ∆so_ <dig> was also analyzed and compared with that of wt and strain ec- <dig>  using a small-volume, single-chamber ec reactor equipped with a working electrode poised at + <dig>  v  for the stable and short-term measurement of electric current . strain ec- <dig> and ∆so_ <dig> generated 90% and 60%, respectively, higher current than wt. these results indicated that although the disruption of so_ <dig> affected colony morphology, cell surface hydrophobicity, and current-generating ability, it was not the only cause for the distinct phenotype of strain ec- <dig>  the reason for this will be discussed later.

expression of cps biosynthesis genes
our previous study found that cpss negatively affect current generation in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  <cit> . in addition, the cps biosynthesis genes, which are located within a large gene cluster , are reported to be down-regulated in a so_ <dig> knockout mutant  <cit> . we therefore hypothesized that cps biosynthesis was repressed in strain ec- <dig>  resulting in the increased ability of this mutant to generate current. to examine this hypothesis, wt, ec- <dig> and ∆so_ <dig> cells were grown in lmm under fumarate-reducing conditions, and expression levels of three cps biosynthesis genes  were determined by the quantitative reverse transcription pcr  analysis of extracted total rna . in both ec- <dig> and ∆so_ <dig>  expression levels of the cps biosynthesis genes were decreased to 40%–54% of those in wt , supporting the speculation that the repression of cps is related to the increased current generation by these two mutant strains. however, the expression levels of so_ <dig> and so_ <dig> did not significantly differ between ec- <dig> and ∆so_ <dig>  and the expression level of so_ <dig> was slightly decreased in ∆so_ <dig> as compared with that in ec- <dig>  these results suggest that the high current-generating capability of ec- <dig>  which exceeded that of ∆so_ <dig>  was not simply due to the decreased expression of cps biosynthesis genes.

differentially expressed genes in ec-2
to investigate why ec- <dig> exhibited a distinct phenotype from ∆so_ <dig>  gene expression profiles in the two mutants were analyzed and compared by transcriptome analysis. total rna from ec- <dig> and ∆so_ <dig> was prepared from cells cultured in lmm under fumarate-reducing conditions and subjected to microarray analysis. the reliability of the microarray analysis was validated by qrt-pcr of five selected genes . a high correlation  was observed between the microarray and qrt-pcr results.

microarray analysis revealed that  <dig> genes had significantly different expression levels  in strains ec- <dig> and ∆so_ <dig> . among the  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated in strain ec- <dig> as compared with ∆so_ <dig>  the up-regulated genes included those assigned to the cog  categories of “transcription”, “signal transduction mechanisms”, “nucleotide transport and metabolism”, and “amino acid transport and metabolism”. notably, expression levels of the genes involved in methionine biosynthesis, metr and mete, were remarkably up-regulated in ec- <dig>  it is known that metr acts as a transcriptional activator for the mete gene  <cit> , suggesting that the overexpression of mete is related to that of metr. the expression of luxs, encoding s-ribosyl homocysteinase, was also up-regulated in ec- <dig>  this is notable because luxs is involved in biofilm development in many bacteria, including e. coli and s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  <cit> . in addition, it was found that the so_ <dig> gene was up-regulated in ec- <dig> compared to ∆so_ <dig>  but this was due to the complete deletion of this gene in ∆so_ <dig>

the expression levels of metr, mete, and luxs were also examined and compared in wt, ec- <dig>  and ∆so_ <dig> by qrt-pcr . it was confirmed that these three genes were overexpressed in ec- <dig>  whereas their expression levels were not significantly different between wt and ∆so_ <dig>  suggesting that the overexpression of these genes is attributable to mutations specific to ec- <dig> 

the down-regulated genes in ec- <dig>  included a number of genes located within the lambdaso prophage region   <cit> . the transcriptome analysis also revealed that the so_ <dig> gene, which is located immediately downstream of so_ <dig>  was also down-regulated in ec- <dig>  this was considered to be due to a polar effect caused by insertion of the tn into so_ <dig>  the so_ <dig>  so_ <dig>  and so_ <dig> genes, which are categorized into the cog category “signal transduction mechanisms” and “cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis”, respectively, were also down-regulated in ec- <dig> 

discussion
in this study, we isolated and characterized the novel s. oneidensis mr- <dig> mutant strain ec- <dig>  which exhibits an increased ability to generate current in mfc and ec reactors. in addition, strain ec- <dig> forms flat, rough, and extraordinarily large colonies that are clearly distinct from the morphology of wt colonies , implying that cell surface structure and physicochemical properties are altered in this mutant. as we previously provided evidence that cell surface hydrophobicity influences the adhesiveness of s. oneidensis cells to graphite felt electrodes and affects current generation in mfcs  <cit> , we also examined the adhesiveness and hydrophobicity of ec- <dig> cells. compared to wt, ec- <dig> cells attached with higher frequency to graphite felt anodes  and had a more hydrophobic surface . taken together, these results suggest that mutations introduced into ec- <dig> modified the cell surface structure and hydrophobicity, resulting in the enhanced adhesiveness of cells to graphite felt electrodes and increased current generation. a similar trend has also been observed for strain ∆so_ <dig>  which contains a mutation in a gene necessary for cps synthesis and shows altered cell-surface hydrophobicity and enhanced the adhesiveness to graphite felt anodes  <cit> . we therefore hypothesized that genes involved in the synthesis of cps or other cell surface structures were mutated in strain ec- <dig> 

we determined that the so_ <dig>  gene, which encodes a dna-binding response regulator of the bara/uvry two-component regulatory system, was disrupted in strain ec- <dig> by tn insertion. in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  so_ <dig> is involved in the transcriptional regulation of a large number of genes, including cps biosynthesis genes  <cit> , suggesting that disruption of so_ <dig> in strain ec- <dig> modified cell surface structure and led to the enhanced current generation in mfcs. the involvement of so_ <dig> in current generation was examined by constructing an in-frame deletion mutant of so_ <dig> , which was found to generate higher current in an ec, indicating the involvement of so_ <dig> in current generation. ∆so_ <dig> cells also exhibited altered colony morphology and increased cell surface hydrophobicity , and qrt-pcr analyses demonstrated that the expression of several cps biosynthesis genes  was repressed . these results support the notion that disruption of the so_ <dig> gene affects cps synthesis and cell surface hydrophobicity, resulting in increased current generation. however, strain ec- <dig> formed larger colonies, exhibited higher hydrophobicity, and generated higher current than ∆so_ <dig>  indicating that the disruption of so_ <dig> was not the only cause for the distinct phenotype of strain ec- <dig>  as southern-blotting analysis confirmed that ec- <dig> had a single tn insertion in so_ <dig> , it is likely that unknown mutations, in addition to the tn insertion, may have been spontaneously introduced during the long-term  electrochemical cultivation of strain ec- <dig>  another explanation is that gene located downstream of the tn insertion site in so_ <dig> are differently expressed in ec- <dig>  however, it is unlikely that the distinct phenotypic features of ec- <dig> are attributable to the decreased expression of so_ <dig> . further investigation, such as genome sequencing of strain ec- <dig>  is needed to examine these hypotheses.

we examined and compared the gene expression profiles of ec- <dig> and ∆so_ <dig> to understand the physiological differences between these two strains. qrt-pcr  and microarray  analyses demonstrated that expression of cps biosynthesis genes did not largely differ between ec- <dig> and ∆so_ <dig>  suggesting that the distinct features of ec- <dig> are not attributable to differential expression of cps synthesis genes. however, we identified a number of genes that were differentially expressed between ec- <dig> and ∆so_ <dig> . notably, the methionine biosynthesis genes metr and mete were highly up-regulated  in ec- <dig>  although it remains unclear why these genes were overexpressed. it is also interesting that the luxs gene was up-regulated in ec- <dig>  as this enzyme catalyzes the conversion of s-ribosyl homocysteine to homocysteine and  <dig> -dihydroxy- <dig> -pentanedione , and is widely conserved in both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . luxs functions as an autoinducer- <dig>  synthase because dpd is spontaneously converted to ai- <dig>  <cit> . luxs is also involved in the activated methyl cycle   <cit>  which is responsible for the synthesis of homocysteine, methionine, and s-adenosylmethionine , a major methyl donor source that is utilized for various cellular processes including the methylation of dna and methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins  <cit> . mete  and metr  are also involved in the amc. in s. oneidensis, disruption of luxs negatively affects biofilm development on solid surfaces by interrupting the amc  <cit> . it has been also reported that a luxs-complemented  mutant of e. coli was deficient in pili production and formed a thicker biofilm than the wt strain, phenotypes that were suggested to be due to the depletion of sam resulting from elevated luxs expression  <cit> . in addition, a metr mutant  of pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibited altered colony morphology due to a severe defect in swarming motility  <cit> , suggesting that the amc is associated with cell motility and colony morphology. it is therefore possible that the overexpression of amc-associated genes in ec- <dig> influences cell surface structure or motility, resulting in the altered colony morphology and increased adhesiveness of cells to electrodes. studies are underway to investigate this possibility.

the function and expression of the metr, mete, and luxs genes are considered to be closely related, because homocysteine, one of the products of luxs, acts as a co-regulator for metr and stimulates the transcription of mete <cit> . we found a potential metr-binding site in the upstream intergenic region of the mr- <dig> luxs gene  that closely matches the consensus metr-binding sequence reported in e. coli and other bacteria   <cit> . a similar sequence was also identified in the intergenic region between mete and metr . these findings suggest the possibility that metr regulates the expression of luxs, as well as that of met genes, in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  a putative metr-binding sequence was also found upstream of glya . because metr activates the transcription of glya in e. coli <cit> , it is likely that the overexpression of metr in ec- <dig> resulted in the increased expression of glya. in addition to these amc-related genes, the microarray analysis detected  <dig> genes other than so_ <dig> and so_ <dig> that were differentially regulated in ec- <dig>  including  <dig> genes located within the lambdaso prophage region . although it has been reported that prophage-mediated cell lysis enhances biofilm formation in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  <cit> , the regulation and involvement of these genes in the observed phenotype of ec- <dig> is unknown.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study indicates that so_ <dig>  and other biofilm formation-related genes, including those involved in cps biosynthesis and the amc, play important roles in determining colony morphology, cell surface properties, and current-generating capability of s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  thus, it might be possible to control the adhesion of cells to electrodes by altering the expression of these genes, and thereby increase the efficiency of bess. although the present study focused on the altered gene expression profiles of strain ec- <dig>  proteomic and metabolomic approaches will also provide useful information for understanding the distinct features of this mutant. future studies will be conducted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the increased current-generating capability of strain ec- <dig>
