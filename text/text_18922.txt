BACKGROUND
complete genome sequences of many plants, including economically important small grain cereals such as barley, are unlikely to be available in the near future if they have large genomes and contain much repetitive dna. the barley genome is  <dig> mbp, which is more than twelve times rice, and composed of at least 80% highly repetitive dna, which is likely to preclude a whole-genome assembly from shotgun sequences obtained with currently available technologies. however, access to most of the genes of barley and numerous other organisms can be gained through cdnas  and sequenced pcr amplicons, which provide a facile route to single nucleotide polymorphisms  in protein-encoding transcribed genes. as of the january  <dig>   <dig> release of dbest, there were  <dig>  sanger-sequenced ests from barley. these were derived principally from eight malting barley cultivars and one wild barley accession, with a minor fraction from several other barley genotypes. here we describe the use of the majority of this transcriptome sequence resource to develop high-throughput snp genotyping in barley, application of the new snp methods to the production of a high-density and high quality snp map that can be related readily to prior maps through shared markers and other grass genomes through synteny, and deployment of these new resources in support of marker-assisted breeding and association genetic analyses.

in recent years there has been a surge in marker density and convergence toward consensus maps for barley. rostoks et al.  <cit>  developed a consensus map containing  <dig> markers  from three doubled haploid populations. wenzl et al.  <cit>  combined dart with rflp, ssr and sts from nine mapping populations to create a consensus map containing  <dig> markers. marcel et al.  <cit>  compiled rflp, aflp and ssr data from six mapping populations to produce a consensus map containing  <dig> markers. stein et al.  <cit>  used three doubled haploid mapping populations and combined new data from  <dig>  markers  with prior data from  <dig> anchor markers to produce a  <dig> marker consensus map. varshney et al.  <cit>  produced a  <dig> ssr consensus map by joining six independent maps. potokina et al.  <cit>  combined snp and other transcript derived markers to position  <dig> loci on the steptoe × morex  <cit>  linkage map. hearnden et al.  <cit>  combined  <dig> ssr and dart markers on a map from a wide cross. several additional maps which have used portions of the snp data described in the present work have been published or are nearing publication including a  <dig> snp and sts map from the haruno nijo × ouh <dig> population  <cit>  and a  <dig> marker map  from the oregon wolfe barley population  <cit> , among others. marker intersection between these maps is significant, but missing data, non-uniform data quality and anonymity of many markers constrain the accuracy of the map merging process and the resolution of synteny between barley and other genomes. here we describe a new element of the map convergence equation, a high fidelity and dense consensus map produced entirely from transcribed gene snps using only a very robust portion of genotyping data derived from four mapping populations utilizing the illumina goldengate assay . maps that include snps in protein-coding genes facilitate genome content comparisons by virtue of the high conservation of protein sequences across genera, thus enabling sequence similarity searches to find orthologs. the snps and data described herein have been made available incrementally in parallel with their production since mid- <dig> to the barley community to facilitate research. here we provide full details of the development of the snp genotyping platform and some of the insight it has brought.

RESULTS
identification of snps and development of goldengate assays
details of the identification of approximately  <dig>  snps from est and pcr amplicon sequence alignments, and development of three test phase and two production scale illumina goldengate oligonucleotide pool assays , are briefly summarized in methods and provided more fully in supplemental text . in total,  <dig> snps were tested using  <dig> dna samples on pilot opas popa <dig> and popa <dig>  and  <dig> dna samples on popa <dig>  followed by selection of  <dig> technically satisfactory and genetically most informative snps for representation on two production opas  . of these  <dig> snps,  <dig> originated from ests and  <dig> from pcr amplicons derived from genomic sequences. of the  <dig> snps selected for two production opas,  <dig> were from ests and  <dig> from pcr amplicons. there was considerable intersection in the sets of snps provided by each identification path. for all opas preference was given to snps identified by amplicon sequencing. the final tally of surviving snps from each selection path included  <dig> %  of the est-derived and  <dig> %  of the pcr amplicon-derived snps. by this metric, the overall success rates were essentially equal for the two strategies for snp discovery, ests versus genomic amplicon sequences.

the yield of snps from each of  <dig> pairwise genotype alignments of ests  revealed a strong linear relationship  between the number of snps and the product of the number of ests. for example, the initial set of  <dig> pairwise genotype comparisons between eight malting barley cultivars and one wild barley accession  is provided in figure s <dig>  additional file 2), where this linear relationship and the higher frequency of snps when including the wild barley accession are readily apparent. in retrospect, it was fortuitous for snp discovery that researchers in each country chose their own local favourite malting barley for est sequencing.

genetic linkage maps
for each of the four mapping populations the linkage groups separated cleanly using mstmap  at lod  <dig> or  <dig> and generally remained intact at higher lod values. the four maps from individual crosses were fused using mergemap  to form a consensus map containing  <dig> snp loci with a total map length of  <dig> cm . the identity and polarity of linkage groups were determined by integrating  <dig> previously mapped bin markers  <cit>  into the sxm and consensus maps . because the snp data are more complete and seem generally to be of higher quality than the sxm bin marker data, the  <dig> "snp-only" map and its distance coordinates are taken as the central point of reference in this paper . table s <dig>  provides map coordinates for each of the four individual maps, the sxm map with  <dig> bin markers, the  <dig> snp-only consensus map and the  <dig> marker consensus map containing  <dig> snps and  <dig> sxm bin markers. the number and distribution of loci for each individual snp-only map and the consensus snp-only map are given in table  <dig>  in all maps, chromosome 5h has the greatest length, a mean of  <dig> cm, consistent with previously published linkage maps. chromosome 5h is also the most populated with  <dig> snp loci and is subdivided into the largest number of marker bins . on the lower end of the spectrum chromosome 4h has only  <dig> snp loci distributed among  <dig> marker bins covering  <dig> cm. the relationship of nearly one marker bin per cm holds for all seven linkage groups.

once the snp loci were arranged by position on the consensus map, graphical visualization enabled inspection of the distribution of recombination events. the genotype data and graphical genotype displays for three of the four mapping populations  are provided in table s <dig> , where it can be seen that there are no singleton double recombinant loci in densely marked regions of any of the maps. since such loci are often indicative of genotyping errors, the complete absence of suspicious double recombinants can be considered an indicator of high fidelity of the data from the  <dig> snp loci selected for linkage map production. other quality metrics include the frequency of missing data or apparent heterozygosity; aside from two instances of apparent heterozygosity at locus 1_ <dig> in two seemingly identical owb doubled haploid lines # <dig> and # <dig> , all individuals in all three mapping populations had homozygous genotype calls for all loci and no missing data. this is 100% of  <dig>  possible genotype calls in the mxb population,  <dig> % of  <dig>  possible genotype calls in the owb population and 100% of  <dig>  possible genotype calls in the sxm population. the high fidelity and lack of missing data among these selected  <dig> snps facilitated the production of individual and consensus maps. more than  <dig> snps with imperfect but still high quality data  were not utilized for this map.

segregation distortion was observed in all four mapping populations, being most pronounced in the mxb population in the pericentric regions of 1h, 2h, 5h and 7h and the long arm of 7h. interestingly, on 7h the distortion was toward the maternal allele  in the pericentric region but toward the paternal allele  on the long arm.

alternative marker names
table s <dig>  provides a cross-reference between synonymous marker names, relating snps mapped in the present work to the same genes mapped previously using other marker systems  <cit> . to generate this cross reference, all of the harvest:barley assembly # <dig> unigenes  were searched using blastn against the graingenes "sequenced probes" database http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/gg2/index.shtml at a cut-off of 1e- <dig>  probes that matched more than three u <dig> unigenes were ignored. the result was  <dig> previously mapped probes matching  <dig> unigenes. the list of probes was then reduced to those mapped in marcel et al.  <cit>  and the list of unigenes was limited to those which were sources of the  <dig> mapped snps. finally, the map position of the snp and the previously mapped probe were compared, discarding a few with gross mismatches in genome location . the resulting intersection contains  <dig> snps representing  <dig> u <dig> unigenes matching  <dig> sequenced probes. by comparing the map positions in table s <dig>  one can see that there is perfect co linearity of shared marker order between the two maps, though there are differences in map distances throughout each linkage group. there are no shared markers on 4hl, which illustrates the need for a more comprehensive cross-reference resource than just these two consensus maps. a similar operation can be performed to relate other maps to the present  <dig> snp map. it should be noted also that the original snp names from scri  correspond in many cases to snps used in rostoks et al.  <cit>  and the original snp names from ipk  correspond to snps in kota et al.  <cit> . thus, those two maps can be readily cross-referenced to the present map using in-common marker names. also, as stated above,  <dig> bin markers from the sxm map of kleinhofs and graner  <cit>  are included in table s <dig> . overall, cross-referencing the  <dig> snp-only map to previous maps provides an important bridge between additional resources including a physical map now being coupled to the  <dig> snp-only map and qtls, simple trait determinants and deletion sites that already have been mapped in prior work. szűcs et al.  <cit>  included  <dig> of the snps developed in the present work in addition to ssrs, aflps and dart markers, making the resulting owb map an excellent new point of cross-reference for barley markers.

synteny
each barley snp source sequence was compared to the rice  version  <dig> and version  <dig> gene models  <cit>  using blastx, and the top hit was taken as the most similar rice gene. these rice best hit coordinates were used as the basis of alignments of each of the seven barley chromosomes with the twelve rice chromosomes. figure  <dig> is a screen shot from harvest:barley  <cit>  showing a detailed alignment of barley chromosome 5h with rice chromosomes. from this and each of the other six barley-rice alignments the marker density is sufficient to clearly reveal major elements of barley-rice synteny, consistent in general with prior publications on triticeae-rice synteny . of the seven barley chromosomes, 5h has the most complex barley-rice synteny relationship, being the only barley chromosome composed of major syntenous blocks from more than two ancestors of rice chromosomes. an illustration of barley-rice synteny for all seven barley chromosomes is provided in figure  <dig>  the simplest relationships are essentially total synteny between barley 3h versus rice  <dig>  and barley 6h versus rice  <dig> . the four remaining barley chromosomes each are composed of ancestors of two rice chromosomes, in each case having one ancestral chromosome nested within the pericentric region, flanked by segments of the other syntenic chromosome. detailed views of synteny similar to figure  <dig>  but with zoom-in and active links to external databases, are available for all seven chromosomes through the windows version of harvest:barley  <cit> .

an interesting consequence of the evolutionary history of barley chromosomes is that the number of expressed genes in the pericentric regions is highly variable, ranging from relatively few in the cases of barley 3h and 6h to very many in the most extreme case of barley 7h. the relative genetic map density of expressed genes has major implications for plant breeding efforts. if, for example, a trait maps to an ancestral telomeric region within the pericentric region of barley 7h then it will be much less likely that the gene controlling that trait can be separated from neighbouring genes by recombination than, for example, a gene located in the ancestral centromeric region of rice chromosome  <dig>  which is located in a more recombinationally active region on barley chromosome 5h. for example there have been several as yet unsuccessful attempts to map-base clone mlg, a powdery mildew resistance gene located in the gene-dense pericentric region of 4h . similarly, the level of difficulty in map-based cloning efforts will also depend on the gene density in regions of low recombination. due to high gene density in ancestral telomeric regions which are now nested within barley chromosomes, the pericentric regions of five barley chromosomes  have high gene density.

the version  <dig> rice genome sequence coordinates, including chromosome, arm and base pair position, are included in table s <dig> , along with the chromosome and arm position from version  <dig>  the  <dig> genetically mapped barley snps were derived from  <dig> source sequences, of which  <dig> have a rice blastx match of at least  <dig> × e- <dig>  a total of  <dig> of these had a best blastx against a gene positioned to different rice chromosomes when comparing ortholog locations in rice version  <dig> to version  <dig>  it is interesting that  <dig> of the  <dig>  changes in the rice genome annotations brought rice-barley synteny into line with the barley genetic map,  <dig> of the  <dig>  changes degraded rice-barley synteny and  <dig>  had a neutral effect because neither the version  <dig> nor  <dig> rice annotations were syntenic with barley. one had a neutral effect because both blast hits were consistent with syntenic duplications in the barley and rice genomes. it is not unusual to find imperfect synteny such as the  <dig> of  <dig>  revised but non-syntenic positions; in fact  <dig> of the  <dig> mapped barley snp source sequences  do not point to a best rice blastx within the major synteny block. however, from this comparison of the edited positions in rice versions  <dig> versus  <dig> to the  <dig> snp barley genetic linkage map, it appears that the barley snp map is the more stable point of reference. consequently, it may be of some benefit to use the barley genetic map for further revisions of the rice genome sequence.

bopa <dig> and bopa <dig> elements and performance
as discussed above, the two production opas, bopa <dig> and bopa <dig>  had somewhat different design elements. these differences have been reflected in the performance of bopa <dig> and bopa <dig> for the genotyping of breeding germplasm within the barleycap project  <cit> . table  <dig> provides a comparison of bopa <dig> and bopa <dig> in relation to both snp representation and the performance on  <dig> year  <dig> us breeder dna samples in the barleycap project. table  <dig> also summarizes information provided in greater detail in table s <dig>  on the relationship of bopa snps to probe sets on the affymetrix barley <dig> genechip  <cit>  and the  <dig> mapped snps in the present work. extensive analyses of the diversity of breeding germplasm will be the subject of other papers; here we emphasize only the elements and fundamental performance characteristics of bopa <dig> and bopa <dig>  one can see that bopa <dig>  which was designed using only snps with a minor allele frequency  of at least  <dig>  in the design germplasm, yielded maf values less than  <dig>  for only  <dig> snps  in the us breeding materials. in contrast bopa <dig>  which targeted  <dig> snps with maf less than  <dig>  in the design germplasm, yielded maf values less than  <dig>  for  <dig> snps  in the breeding germplasm. this included about three times as many snps with maf =  <dig>  and  <dig>  times as many snps  with maf between  <dig> and  <dig> . thus, bopa <dig> has greater sensitivity to detect rare alleles than does bopa <dig>  some of which may be important for the development of new varieties containing uncommon alleles of certain genes. but, this increased sensitivity is counterbalanced by a compromise in the reduced frequency of informative snps in general.

*among the  <dig> unigenes represented by snps on both bopas,  <dig> have  <dig> snp on bopa <dig>   <dig> have  <dig> snps on bopa <dig>   <dig> has three snps on bopa <dig>   <dig> has four snps on bopa <dig> 

table s <dig>  lists the maf values determined during the design of bopa <dig> and bopa <dig> versus the observed maf values in year  <dig> and year  <dig> barleycap breeding germplasm. for example,  <dig> of  <dig> snps with a design maf of  <dig>  or lower had an observed maf of at least  <dig>  in year  <dig> or  <dig> breeding germplasm. similarly,  <dig> of  <dig> snps with a design maf of  <dig>  or lower had an observed maf of at least  <dig>  in year  <dig> or  <dig> breeding germplasm. the differences between bopa <dig> and bopa <dig> should be carefully considered by potential users, and the characteristics of specific snps should be considered when selecting subsets of snps for other platforms.

other characteristics of the  <dig> snp map
it is perhaps of relevance that there were significant differences in the genetic length of some of the individual chromosomes in the different populations . for example, the genetic length of chromosome 4h in the sxm population is expanded relative to the same chromosome in any other population, and all of the other chromosomes have a longer genetic length in the owb population than in the other populations. also, the genetic map lengths are consistently higher than would be expected from cytogenetic counts of chiasmata per meiosis for this species, as previously noted  <cit>  despite the fact that methodological errors in genotyping can be ruled out in the present work because of the lack of any suspicious-looking singleton double recombinants. the notable deviations from mean genetic distance values indicate that the genetic background as well as environmental factors may have had a significant effect on recombination, and presumably also chiasmata counts, in this species. also, although the broad patterns of synteny within grasses recognized previously by many investigators has been confirmed by this work, the hitherto unprecedented density of gene-derived markers enable further delineation of several inversions and rearrangements of gene order at macro-, meso- and micro-synteny levels. chromosome 5h  provides one example of such rearrangements at the macrosynteny level. the harvest:barley http://harvest.ucr.edu synteny viewer provides zoom-in functionality to enable visualization at meso and micro-synteny levels as well.

access to the linkage map and snp data
the  <dig> snp linkage map can be accessed by several browsers including harvest:barley  <cit>  or  <cit> , graingenes  <cit> , ncbi  <cit>  and tht  <cit> . new versions of the map may become available as additional mapping populations are applied to bopa <dig> and bopa <dig>  linkage disequilibrium is used for mapping and the physical map and genome sequence are coupled to the genetic linkage map.

CONCLUSIONS
the unprecedented density of genic markers and marker bins enabled a high resolution comparison of the genomes of barley and rice. low recombination in pericentric regions is evident from bins containing many more than the average number of markers, meaning that a large number of genes are recombinationally locked into the genetic centromeric regions of several barley chromosomes. examination of us breeding germplasm illustrated the usefulness of bopa <dig> and bopa <dig> in that they provide excellent marker density and sensitivity for detection of minor alleles in this genetically narrow material.
