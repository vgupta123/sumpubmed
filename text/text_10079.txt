BACKGROUND
morphine is among the most common analgesic agents used in the intensive care setting. it is usually administered parenterally as an intravenous infusion. despite its efficacy, its use is associated with a number of hazards including respiratory depression  <cit> , tolerance  <cit> , physiological dependence  <cit>  and abstinence upon discontinuation of treatment  <cit> . less frequent, but perhaps more profound, is the bronchoconstriction, edema and hemodynamic instability seen in some patients following intravenous bolus doses of the drug  <cit> . these effects have been attributed to histamine release from mast cells by morphine  <cit> .

a number of clinical studies have demonstrated an increase in plasma histamine concentration following intravenous morphine administration  <cit> , but these studies generally fail to provide details concerning the formulation of the morphine employed. most of the morphine used in both clinical practice and for clinical investigations contains sodium bisulfite as a preservative  <cit> . until the mid 1980's sulfite preservatives were generally considered universally safe; however, their status was changed after the receipt by the fda of more than  <dig> reports of serious and life-threatening reactions related to sulfite exposure through both diet and therapeutic agents  <cit> .

in the body, sulfites are generally oxidized by the mitochondrial enzyme sulfite oxidase and non-toxic metabolites are excreted in the urine  <cit> . a small amount of the sulfite, either ingested or injected may also be metabolically activated by a number of other enzyme systems including xanthine oxidase  <cit> , peroxidase  <cit>  and prostaglandin h synthetase  <cit> . as an electron acceptor in these reactions or through electron transfer from transition metals such as copper and iron, sulfite may accept an electron from the resulting hydroxyl, superoxide or sulfate radicals  <cit>  leading to the formation of sulfite radical.

sulfite radicals are chemically reactive and have been implicated in lipid  <cit> , protein  <cit>  and nucleic acid  <cit>  oxidation as well as neuronal injury  <cit> . they may stimulate neutrophils to release oxygen free radicals and augment the free radical response to other neutrophil activators  <cit> . in addition, their generation has been shown to contribute to oxidative stress resulting in sulfite toxicity and impaired b-cell function.

the potential generation of free radicals from sulfite preservatives may confound our understanding the association of morphine with histamine release in man. a number of studies have demonstrated that, when exposed to free radicals, mast cells may release histamine  <cit> . it is possible; therefore, that the histamine released following morphine infusion may be the result of the formation of sulfite radicals from the preservative rather than the morphine itself. this study evaluated the possibility that sulfite and its activation might contribute to histamine release by mast cells in vitro.

RESULTS
mast cell histamine release
total histamine content of mast cells was calculated by freezing and thawing suspensions for  <dig> cycles. cell suspensions containing  <dig>  cells/ml released  <dig> μg/ml  histamine, corresponding to  <dig>  pg  histamine per mast cell.

mast cells stimulated with  <dig> μg/ml calcium ionophore released 63%  of total histamine.

effect of sulfite-free morphine concentration on histamine release
the effect of histamine release from mast cells treated with both clinically attained concentrations of morphine and concentrations above those seen clinically was determined.

to chemically defined reaction mixtures, morphine was added at varying concentrations . enzymes causing free radical activation were not present. the blank sample contained no morphine. reaction mixtures were incubated in a water bath at 37°c for  <dig> minutes. experiments were performed in triplicate. histamine release from samples was determined following derivitization with o-phthaldialdehyde and mercaptoethanol using high-performance liquid chromatography as detailed below. histamine release from reaction mixtures was expressed as a % of total histamine present in the cell pellet.

histamine release from reaction mixtures containing morphine at all concentrations was not statistically different  from histamine release from blank samples .

to verify the time dependence of histamine release, a morphine concentration of  <dig> μg/ml was tested. release was detectable as early as  <dig> minutes after the addition of drug and appeared to plateau between  <dig> and  <dig> minutes .

effect of sulfite-containing morphine solutions on histamine release
to determine whether the addition of sodium bisulfite causes increased histamine release from mast cells, sodium bisulfite at a concentration of  <dig> % of morphine concentration  was added to the reaction mixtures described previously. blank samples contained neither morphine nor sulfite. specimens were incubated, dried, re-dissolved, derivitized and analyzed as above.

there was no statistical difference in histamine release at any concentration of morphine with sulfite compared with blank samples .

reaction mixtures containing 668μg/ml morphine with  <dig> % sodium bisulfite were incubated for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minutes yielded results identical to those observed in the absence of sodium bisulfite .

effect of prostaglandin h synthetase on histamine release from mast cell reaction mixtures
prostaglandin h synthestase may catalyze free radical formation  <cit> . the first experiment investigated its effect on mast cell histamine release in the absence of sulfite and morphine. this ensured that any increase in histamine release in subsequent experiments was not due to the effect of the enzyme only.

prostaglandin h synthetase was added to reaction mixtures at a concentration of  <dig> mu. in reaction mixtures containing no drug, the enzyme was added to mast cell samples containing neither morphine nor sulfite. controls contained no enzyme.

reaction mixtures containing the enzyme alone  produced similar histamine release compared to blank samples  of total and  <dig> %  of total respectively). the presence of prostaglandin h synthetase had no effect.

the effect of clinically attained concentrations of morphine in the presence of prostaglandin h synthetase on mast cell histamine release was investigated. in vivo studies show histamine release at these concentrations of morphine  <cit> . morphine sulfate was added to the mast cell solution at clinically attained concentrations of  <dig> ng/ml  and  <dig> ng/ml   <cit> . mast cell histamine release from higher concentrations of morphine  was also investigated.

blank samples contained water instead of morphine. all samples contained  <dig> mu of prostaglandin h synthetase. specimens were incubated, dried, re-dissolved, derivitized and analyzed as described below. histamine release values are shown in table  <dig>  there was no statistical difference between histamine release from morphine samples at both clinically-attained concentrations  and  <dig> ng/ml ) and histamine release from blank samples. histamine release from hmc- <dig> cells incubated with morphine 668μg/ml and  <dig> μg/ml were significantly increased compared with blank samples . results are shown in table  <dig>  maximum histamine release ) occurred at the highest concentration of morphine  .

the effect of sodium bisulfite  <dig> % in varying concentrations of morphine in the presence of prostaglandin h synthetase was investigated. this preservative is present in many morphine preparations and its effect on histamine release from mast cells is determined here. morphine was added to the mast cell samples at concentrations of 668μg/ml,  <dig> μg/ml,  <dig> ng/ml and  <dig> ng/ml. sodium bisulfite was added to samples at a concentration of  <dig> % of morphine concentration. controls contained morphine only. each sample also contained  <dig> mu of prostaglandin h synthetase. specimens were incubated, dried, re-dissolved, derivitized and analyzed as described below. reaction mixtures containing morphine 668μg/ml with  <dig> % sodium bisulfite showed a statistically significant increase in histamine release compared with blank samples . there was no statistical difference in histamine release between morphine only samples at all concentrations and samples containing morphine and  <dig> % sodium bisulfite  , morphine  <dig> μg/ml , morphine  <dig> ng/ml  and morphine  <dig> ng/ml . sulfite did not have any additive effect on histamine release from mast cells in the presence of morphine and prostaglandin h synthetase.

studies looking at plasma histamine levels following morphine administration in humans have shown peak histamine levels within  <dig> minutes of administration  <cit> . this experiment investigated whether maximum histamine release occurred at a similar time in vitro in the presence of the enzyme prostaglandin h synthetase. hmc- <dig> cells were incubated at 37°c for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minutes with morphine 668μg/ml,  <dig> % sodium bisulfite and  <dig> mu prostaglandin h synthetase. the cells were centrifuged and the supernatant was examined for the presence of histamine and expressed as a % of total histamine.

histamine release was time dependent with a maximum effect after  <dig> hour of incubation .

interestingly, reaction mixtures containing a typical peak morphine concentration  showed a significant increase in histamine release in the presence of prostaglandin h synthetase compared with no enzyme. this was true for both sulfite-free  and sulfite-containing  morphine solutions. this suggests that even at clinically-attained morphine concentrations, it is not only possible to cause the metabolic activation of sulfite, but also that of morphine.

the effect of sulfite alone  on histamine release from mast cells was investigated. to  <dig> mast cell reaction mixtures, varying concentrations of sulfite  were added. these concentrations of sulfite correspond to the concentration of sulfite present in morphine solutions of  <dig> ng/ml,  <dig> ng/ml,  <dig> μg/ml and 668μg/ml. to each sample  <dig> mu prostaglandin h synthetase was added. the highest concentration of sulfite  was incubated for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minutes to assess time dependence. the reaction mixtures were incubated, centrifuged and analyzed as described below.

in the presence of prostaglandin h synthetase, sulfite resulted in histamine release from mast cells. there was a significant increase in histamine release  of total) in the reaction mixture containing  <dig> μg/ml sulfite . there was no statistically significant difference in histamine release compared with blank samples at all other concentrations of sulfite  of total, p =  <dig> ),  <dig>  ng/ml sulfite  of total, p =  <dig> ) and  <dig> μg/ml sulfite  of total, p =  <dig> ) .

the time-dependent experiment showed histamine release of 8% of total  at  <dig> minutes incubation,  <dig> % of total  at  <dig> minutes,  <dig> % of total  at  <dig> minutes and  <dig> % of total  at  <dig> minutes.

discussion
our experiments showed similar histamine release from the mast cell line hmc- <dig> stimulated with morphine with or without  <dig> % sodium bisulfite. maximum histamine release was  <dig> % of total in morphine only samples and  <dig> % of total in morphine with  <dig> % sodium bisulfite samples. this percentage is similar to other studies of histamine release in the human mast cell line hmc- <dig>  where maximum release was 20–30%  <cit> . in our study, the concentrations of morphine and sulfite required to achieve maximum histamine release were significantly higher than concentrations seen clinically. reaction mixtures containing sulfite only also caused significant histamine release at high concentrations. blank samples, containing neither morphine nor sulfite, did not cause a significant increase in histamine release . these results suggest that at high concentrations, both sulfite and morphine could be responsible for elevated histamine release from mast cells. in addition to the formation of the sulfite radical from sulfite, it is possible that carbon-centered or nitrogen-centered free radicals are being generated from the metabolic activation of morphine  <cit> , thereby inducing mast cell histamine release.

hmc- <dig> cells contain histamine and release their histamine content in response to various exogenous stimuli  <cit> . our study showed no evidence of elevated histamine release from mast cells when stimulated with morphine and/or sulfite at concentrations seen clinically . although hmc- <dig> exhibits a phenotype similar to that of human mast cells  <cit> , it is possible that immature cells  are less sensitive than mature  cells  <cit> . the model used is an artificial system and may not represent physiological conditions. in addition, maximum histamine release occurred after a one hour incubation. this is significantly different from the in vivo situation, where maximum release usually occurs within  <dig> minutes of morphine administration, and suggests that we were not able to simulate exactly the human environment where histamine release occurs. it is likely that although the sulfite radical is formed rapidly in vitro, it may take some time for its effects to become evident  <cit> .

metabolic activation of sodium bisulfite may occur through a variety of mechanisms. we investigated a number of enzyme systems and our final model used prostaglandin h synthetase. other enzyme systems  did release histamine in our model , but they produced excess background interference in the chromatograms and made identification of peaks difficult. activation of sulfite following morphine administration may not occur through this mechanism, however, and is another possible flaw in our aim to construct a model similar to the one that exists in vivo.

morphine has been shown to cause significant histamine release in vivo, but it has not been investigated whether sulfite, in the form of the sulfite radical, is the cause of this release. our study finds that sulfite in sulfite-containing morphine solutions, at clinically attained concentrations, is not responsible for histamine release in in vitro experiments of the mast cell line hmc- <dig>  but this does not preclude the fact that sulfite may lead to marked elevation in histamine levels in vivo. the release of a significant amount of histamine with either sulfite or morphine at concentrations higher than those seen clinically suggests that both substances may be responsible for histamine release from mast cells. further clinical research studies need to be performed to examine this possibility.

CONCLUSIONS
our study finds that the sulfite in sulfite-containing morphine solutions, at concentrations seen clinically is not responsible for histamine release in in vitro experiments of the mast cell line, hmc- <dig>  but this does not preclude the fact that sulfite may lead to marked elevation in histamine levels in vivo. our experiments suggest that at high concentrations, both morphine and sulfite are responsible for histamine release from mast cells. further in vivo research needs to be performed to examine this possibility.
