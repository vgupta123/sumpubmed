BACKGROUND
mastitis in dairy cattle continues to be an economically important disease. despite extensive management practices including antibiotic treatments, mastitis is estimated to cause annual losses in excess of two billion dollars per annum in the united states alone  <cit> . these losses arise from reduction in milk yield, waste of milk unfit for consumption, antibiotic use and premature culling. the disease can be caused by a wide range of gram negative coliform and gram positive bacteria, as well as yeast, fungi and mycoplasma. however, contagious mastitis, which is transmitted from cow to cow during milking, is principally caused by staphylococcus aureus  <cit> . unlike many other major mastitis-causing pathogens, which are generally associated with acute infections acquired from environmental reservoirs of bacteria, s. aureus causes chronic subclinical infections. control is complicated by a high prevalence of resistance to antibiotics  <cit> . the ability of this bacterium to live within some cells and encapsulated nodules in mammary tissue may contribute to its resistance to antibiotic treatments  <cit> .

the innate immune system in mammals is one of the first lines of host defense to infection as it has the capacity to immediately recognise and respond to the earliest signs of infection. both acute and chronic mastitis conditions are associated with a dramatic increase in somatic cell count  in milk, with neutrophils being the predominant leukocyte found in both the infected mammary quarter and milk  <cit> . neutrophils are essential cellular components of the innate immune system  <cit>  and their accumulation and activation at the site of infection requires local induction of a panel of innate immune molecules, including various chemokines and cytokines  <cit> . early innate immune responses also occur in mammary epithelial cells and these responses underpin subsequent neutrophil infiltration into mammary tissue, the activation of these innate immune cells and increases in milk scc  <cit> .

several studies have examined gene expression in circulating leukocytes close to parturition, a time when cows are more susceptible to mastitis infection, as well as during acute mastitis infections  <cit> . these studies and others using mammary tissue demonstrated that expression of a number of genes involved in immune cell activation, chemotaxis and apoptosis was altered  <cit> . moreover, these gene expression changes have often been shown to translate into corresponding protein expression alterations thereby demonstrating that transcriptional mechanisms primarily control the innate immune response  <cit> . the majority of these studies used infection models that resulted in very strong mammary tissue responses, or measured the responses relatively late after experimental inoculation or during acute naturally acquired clinical mastitis when significant necrotic damage may have been evident.

recent studies have begun to elucidate the direct role of mammary epithelial cells  in the stimulation of the innate immune response  <cit> . these studies indicate that mec respond robustly and rapidly to challenge by either low levels of bacteria or bacterial cell wall components with marked changes in expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines  <cit> . this response probably underpins the subsequent infiltration of mammary tissues by immune cells, particularly neutrophils  <cit> . a broader and more comprehensive examination of gene expression changes produced in mammary epithelial cells and infiltrating immune cells in response to mammary tissue infection with s. aureus may identify the network of gene expression changes that coordinates the early innate immune responses of this tissue. of particular interest are the local mammary tissue responses after initial infection with low numbers of bacteria before the onset of widespread tissue damage.

microarray technology has become an important tool to address complex biological questions by simultaneously measuring the expression of thousands of genes within a tissue. identification of patterns of gene expression can provide insight into the biological functions of their encoded proteins and the networks of protein interactions governing responses of cells to extracellular stimuli. one aim of the current study was to identify the network of genes that becomes activated in mammary tissue in response to a brief and graded intramammary challenge with s. aureus. the identification of these poorly characterised genes and in-depth characterisation of their corresponding proteins may be important for the development of novel strategies to enhance resistance of cows to mastitis and the development of novel antibacterial therapeutic agents. the consequences of these responses in terms of potential secretion of bioactive innate immune proteins into milk may also have relevance to the suckling calf. thus, a second aim is to characterise the biological activities of innate immune proteins that may be present in milk from infected udder quarters.

RESULTS
s. aureus challenge of bovine mammary tissue
to ensure that the dairy cows used in the experiment were free from bacterial infection, milk samples were taken from each udder quarter  <dig> h and  <dig> h prior to intramammary s. aureus infusions and tested for bacterial growth. all quarters from two cows and three quarters from a third cow showed no bacterial growth. milk from one quarter of one cow  showed low level growth of s. aureus  <dig> h prior to the commencement of the experiment, presumably from a mild field mastitis infection. consequently, this quarter was excluded from the experiment. one quarter of each cow was treated with pyrogen-free pbs and this quarter acted as the intra-animal control for subsequent analyses. each cow received different graded doses of s. aureus  by intramammary infusion, ranging from  <dig> ×  <dig> to  <dig> ×  <dig> bacteria .

 <dig> this quarter was not used

milk samples were also taken from each quarter  <dig> h after s. aureus experimental infusion and tested for bacterial growth. the bacterial culture was identified and tested for hemolysis, catalase and coagulase activities . all milk samples from the quarters experimentally infused with s. aureus contained bacteria with positive catalase and coagulase activities and at least partial hemolysis activity on blood agar plates. the bacteria in all of these samples were identified as s. aureus. the milk samples from quarters infused with pyrogen-free pbs had no s. aureus growth, which was consistent with the view that each quarter within an udder is a semi-autonomous physiological unit and can be considered an independent experimental unit during this relatively brief experimental bacterial challenge  <cit> .

 <dig> minor bacterial growth was observed but this was not s. aureus.

quantitative rt-pcr  was used to measure the expression patterns of selected genes in mammary tissue samples taken from each animal  <dig> h after the s. aureus infusion . there were no significant changes in the expression levels of α-s1-casein  or β-casein  as a function of bacterial dose compared with each intra-animal control sample  for all three cows ). therefore, the relatively low doses of s. aureus in combination with the relatively brief infection period did not affect the expression of these milk protein genes in any quarter. this indicates that the experimental model was a good representation of the early stages of infection before there was significant tissue damage leading to the suppression of normal physiological functions.

the expression patterns of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha , interleukin  <dig> beta , interleukin  <dig> , interleukin  <dig>  and cd <dig> antigen , a pivotal cell surface protein mediating detection of bacterial cell wall components, were measured as representatives of early response innate immune genes that are typically up-regulated by bacterial infections of mammary tissue  <cit> . for each of these genes, and within each cow, there were strong and significant responses to the highest bacterial doses compared with each intra-animal control  ). moreover, the responses were dose-dependent, or at least partially so. however, the magnitudes of the fold-changes in gene expression were variable across the three cows for each gene. for example, at a dose of  <dig> ×  <dig> bacteria, the fold changes for tnfα were  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   . furthermore, the responses of samples from cow  <dig> for all of the measured pro-inflammatory cytokines were more pronounced than the responses in the two other cows. for il- <dig> the fold changes were much greater compared with tnfα and also more pronounced in cow  <dig>  the fold changes for il- <dig> were  <dig> and  <dig> at the bacterial doses of  <dig> ×  <dig> and  <dig> ×  <dig>  respectively for cow  <dig>  while corresponding figures for cow  <dig> were  <dig> and  <dig> fold .

microarray analyses of mammary tissue challenged with different doses of s. aureus
we used the bovine innate immune microarray  <cit>  to identify a more complete repertoire of differentially expressed transcripts in bovine udder tissues from the three dairy cows challenged by intramammary infusion with s. aureus. it was clear from the cow to cow variations in the initial gene expression data that each cow required independent assessment ). consequently, an 'all-pairs' experimental design was used for each cow i.e. each sample taken from one cow was tested against all other samples from the same cow with each comparison also involving dye swaps . in this manner, every sample was measured a total of six times, which allowed identification of differentially expressed genes with respect to the intra-animal control with a false discovery rate  adjusted p <  <dig>   <cit> . differentially expressed elements were independently identified for each cow. in a conservative extension of this analysis, a subset of the significantly differentially expressed elements was selected that had:  expression data in all test samples and;  showed at least 2-fold change in expression in any of the test samples compared to the control sample. the signal for each of these  <dig> differentially expressed elements was then averaged in all cows receiving the same dose. in this way, gene expression values were obtained for these genes from the test quarters infused with s. aureus at dose rates of  <dig> ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   or  <dig> , <dig>  bacteria relative to the control quarters. the expression data for these  <dig> elements were clustered using a k-means algorithm into  <dig> clusters using default parameters  <cit> . the gene redundancy on the microarray revealed overlap between several of the clusters. consequently, these clusters were manually collapsed into two primary clusters in which the significantly differentially expressed elements were either reduced  or increased  in response to s. aureus infection . each cluster is represented by the centroid of gene expression for all elements in the cluster. the  <dig> elements that showed increased expression in response to s. aureus challenge are shown in figure  <dig>  while the  <dig> elements with decreased gene expression in response to s. aureus are presented in figure  <dig> 

the cluster containing elements that were up-regulated in response to infection showed increased gene expression only as the number of infused bacteria reached a threshold dose i.e. the centroid for this cluster showed little response at a dose up to  <dig>  bacteria but a strong and sustained positive response at higher doses. as expected from the data, there was substantial variation in the responses of individual genes at the higher doses . the characteristics of this cluster are exemplified by the responses of genes such as il- <dig>  il-1β and il- <dig> ). the cluster containing down-regulated genes showed suppression of gene expression compared to the controls at all bacterial doses, although these effects were not as marked.

a number of the differentially expressed elements identified by this analysis were anonymous on the microarray and consequently inserts from the corresponding cdna clones were sequenced and annotated. this process revealed that the  <dig> up-regulated elements represented  <dig> unique transcripts  while the  <dig> down-regulated elements represented  <dig> unique transcripts . this reflected the redundancy of elements on the microarray and the technical replication of the data. due to the biased representation of innate immune genes on the microarray, a gene ontology  analysis was not performed to identify enriched go terms. for convenience of presentation and discussion however, the differentially expressed genes were placed in several functional categories, which were derived by direct examination of the scientific literature .

the up-regulated genes were dominated by  <dig> genes encoding proteins involved in intercellular signalling. many of these were well defined pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines  as well as proteins with less defined functions but associated with inflammatory responses   <cit> . interestingly, this group of genes also included leptin , alluding to a link between infection and energy partitioning in the form of lipid storage and metabolism  <cit> . another group  associated with the up-regulated genes was characterised as cell surface receptors. many of these are intimately associated with the previous functional group. for example, the toll-like receptor pathway senses and responds to bacterial infections through the toll-like receptor signalling pathway resulting in stimulation of synthesis of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines  <cit> . this specific pathway is represented by toll-like receptor  <dig> , toll-like receptor  <dig>  and cd <dig>  <cit> . both tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> are membrane-bound pattern recognition receptors. in addition, the cell surface receptor group contains tnf receptor superfamily  <dig>  and cd <dig> antigen , both of which are components of the tnf receptor superfamily. the up-regulation of a group of transcription factors and transcriptional co-regulators  may be underlying the transcriptional changes of other genes in these clusters. many of these former genes encode proteins that are pivotal regulators of innate immune responsiveness e.g. fos, jun, nf-κb <dig>  nf-κb1a  <cit> . a small group of genes involved in apoptosis was also identified.

the cluster containing the down-regulated genes was dominated by  <dig> genes encoding proteins which are components of the cytoskeleton or extracellular matrix. thus, even over the relatively short duration of the infection, the beginning of a tissue remodelling process may have been in progress, although this did not adversely affect the transcription of milk protein genes. other major functional groups in this cluster included apoptosis , cell surface receptors  and intercellular signalling proteins . the latter group encoded a diverse group of proteins including interleukin  <dig> , which normally suppresses proinflammatory cytokine production  <cit> . resistin , another member of this group, is an adipocyte-secreted protein involved in type ii diabetes and obesity and its identification provides a further link between energy metabolism and inflammatory responses in mammary tissue  <cit> . somewhat surprisingly, camp, which encodes a cathelicidin anti-microbial peptide, was also in this down-regulated group. although the qrt-pcr data indicated no significant change in the expression of αs1-casein , the microarray data included this gene in the list of down-regulated genes. the reasons for this discrepancy are not clear but could reflect higher reproducibility of the microarray data relative to the qrt-pcr data for genes that are highly expressed.

validation of differentially expressed genes using qrt-pcr
all of the genes, with the exception of cd <dig> and tnfα, that were differentially expressed as defined by the initial qrt-pcr analyses ), were also differentially expressed when measured by microarray analysis. the reasons why cd <dig> and tnfα were not identified in the microarray analysis but showed differential expression when measured by qrt-pcr are not clear but may relate to the conservative process used in the former analysis and the differing sensitivities of the two technologies. qrt-pcr was also used to verify the differential expression of two additional up-regulated genes, s100a <dig>  and ptx <dig> ), identified by the microarray analysis ). consistent with the general trends in previous data ), the expression patterns of s100a <dig> and ptx <dig> were significantly up-regulated within each cow but showed varying responses relative to each intra-animal control. at the common infection dose of  <dig> ×  <dig> bacteria for cows  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  there was  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold up-regulation of s100a <dig> expression and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> fold up-regulation of ptx <dig> expression, compared to the intra-animal controls, respectively  ).

expression of s100a <dig> and ptx <dig> after stimulation of bovine mammary epithelial cells with lipopolysaccharide or lipoteichoic acid
the expression levels of s100a <dig> and ptx <dig> transcripts in primary bovine mammary epithelial cells  grown in cell culture were significantly increased in response to stimulation by  <dig> μg/ml of lipopolysaccharide  or  <dig> μg/ml of lipoteichoic acid  for a period of  <dig> h . s100a <dig> was significantly  up-regulated 4– <dig> h after lps stimulation with a maximal fold change of  <dig>  at  <dig> h. the effect of stimulation with lta was less pronounced and resulted in significantly  increased s100a <dig> mrna expression at 8– <dig> h post-stimulation with the expression reaching a plateau at  <dig> h ). ptx <dig> was up-regulated at  <dig> h  of stimulation with lps  but then declined to basal levels. lta stimulation resulted in enhanced expression of ptx <dig> at  <dig> h post-stimulation   but the levels thereafter rapidly declined and at  <dig> h and  <dig> h there were significantly  lower levels of expression compared to the starting sample ). thus, bmec were likely to be the origin of at least some of the enhanced expression of s100a <dig> and ptx <dig> observed in mammary tissue challenged with s. aureus. moreover, the time course responses for s100a <dig> and ptx <dig> were strikingly different.

expression and purification of rs100a <dig> and rptx3
the coding sequences for bovine s100a <dig> and the mature form of bovine ptx <dig> were amplified by pcr, sequence verified and cloned into the pqe <dig> vector. the respective recombinant proteins, rs100a <dig> and rptx <dig>  were solubilised from inclusion bodies using  <dig> m urea and purified using ni-nta affinity chromatography. sds-polyacrylamide gel analyses confirmed that the purified protein monomers were of the predicted sizes, i.e. ~ <dig> kda for rs100a <dig> and ~ <dig> kda for rptx <dig> . the latter protein was reduced and alkylated before analysis as this was required to ensure removal of rptx <dig> oligomers. n-terminal sequencing further validated the identities of the two recombinant proteins. these recombinant proteins were used to raise corresponding polyclonal antibodies in rabbits, which were used to test whether s100a <dig> and ptx <dig> were present in milk samples from infected cows.

identification of s100a <dig> and ptx <dig> in milk from cows with intramammary s. aureus infection
quantification of s100a <dig> and ptx <dig> proteins in milk from cows subjected to intramammary infection with s. aureus
antigen specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays  were developed to measure the quantities of s100a <dig> and ptx <dig> in milk samples taken from udder quarters after s. aureus intramammary challenges of the three cows . significantly increased s100a <dig> protein expression  was detected in the milk whey from the infected udders in all three cows relative to their respective intramammary control quarters . there was a low level of s100a <dig> expression in milk samples from the control non-infected udders. moreover, there was a relatively small but significantly  higher level of s100a <dig> in milk from the control udder quarters  <dig> h post-infection compared with the corresponding pre-infection samples. thus, using this antigen capture elisa there was evidence for a small intermammary quarter effect on s100a <dig> levels in milk.

the responses to infection in the different cows were varied. cow  <dig> had a concentration of  <dig> ng/ml of s100a <dig> in milk from the control udder at  <dig> h post-infection while the s100a <dig> levels in the udders that had been challenged with  <dig> ×  <dig> and  <dig> ×  <dig> bacteria were almost five times greater  . cow  <dig> had lower levels of s100a <dig> in the control udder  and the levels of s100a <dig> increased in a dose-dependent manner . the s100a <dig> protein expression was relatively high in milk from udder quarters infected with bacterial doses of  <dig> ×  <dig> and  <dig> ×  <dig> in cow  <dig>   while the quantities of s100a <dig> detected in milk from the udder quarter challenged with the lowest dose of  <dig> ×  <dig> bacteria  was not significantly different from the control udder .

increased concentrations of ptx <dig> were detected in milk whey from the infected udders in all three cows compared to their intramammary quarters ). ptx <dig> could not be detected in milk from the pre-infection udders or the post-infection control udders. cow  <dig> showed the highest levels of ptx <dig> in milk from the udder quarters that had been challenged with  <dig> ×  <dig> and  <dig> ×  <dig> bacteria . cow  <dig> had less marked, but still significantly  increased levels of ptx <dig> in response to the bacterial dose of  <dig> ×  <dig> . the quantities of ptx <dig> detected in milk from the udder quarters of cow  <dig> challenged with the two higher bacterial doses,  <dig> ×  <dig> and  <dig> ×  <dig> of s. aureus, were significantly  increased .

correlation between the somatic cell count  and s100a <dig> protein expression in milk from dairy cows
the s100a <dig> protein levels in milk were measured using the s100a12-specific antigen capture elisa and correlated with the milk somatic cell count  from a selection of  <dig> dairy cows with scc ranging from  <dig> ×  <dig> –  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml . there was a linear correlation between s100a <dig> quantity in milk and milk scc . the ptx3-specific antigen capture elisa was not used to examine the correlation between ptx <dig> quantity in milk and scc due to the relatively low levels of ptx <dig> present in all milk samples.

recombinant s100a <dig> has anti-microbial activity against e. coli
a previous publication suggested that human s100a <dig> may have anti-microbial activity  <cit> . the capacity of recombinant bovine s100a <dig>  to inhibit e. coli growth was examined using a microtiter dilution anti-microbial susceptibility testing assay  <cit> . inhibition of growth of e. coli  was observed in the rs100a <dig> concentration range of  <dig> – <dig> μg/ml  ). the greatest inhibitory activity was observed using  <dig> μg/ml of rs100a <dig>  which resulted in a  <dig>  fold reduction in optical density of the e. coli culture. under the same conditions rs100a <dig> did not significantly  affect the growth of s. aureus  at any concentration ).

expression of recombinant bovine ptx <dig> in trichoplusia ni insect cells
recombinant bovine ptx <dig>  was also produced in insect cells to obtain a correctly folded and biologically active protein. the culture supernatant from the trichoplusia ni  insect cells transfected with the piex5-ptx <dig> construct was analysed by sds-page and immunobloting under reducing conditions. immunoreactive proteins with an apparent molecular size of  <dig> kda  and  <dig> kda  were present but not observed in the culture supernatant from the plasmid-only control . rtnptx <dig> produced by these cells was purified from the culture supernatant using anion exchange chromatography. figure  <dig> shows silver-stained sds-page and immunoblot analyses of purified rtnptx <dig> after reduction and alkylation. the purified protein was represented by two equal staining bands of mr  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda compared with a predicted size for the mature protein of  <dig>  kda. the ptx <dig> sequence has a potential n-linked glycosylation site at amino acid position  <dig>  and hence the larger band may reflect a more glycosylated form of the protein. n-terminal sequencing of rtnptx <dig>  from both bands, showed identity with the predicted amino acid sequence of the mature bovine ptx <dig> polypeptide . the mature ptx <dig> protein sequence contains nine cysteine residues, which may mediate formation of multimers  <cit> . indeed, rtnptx <dig> was present in solution as a large oligomer  as defined by gel permeation chromatography .

purified rtnptx <dig> binds the c1q component of the human complement system
the binding of human ptx <dig> expressed in chinese hamster ovary  cells to human c1q has been previously demonstrated  <cit> . to characterise the binding of rtnptx <dig> to c1q, dilutions of two different preparations of purified rtnptx <dig> were added to  <dig> ng of immobilised human c1q and after washing bound rtnptx <dig> was measured. figure  <dig> demonstrates that rtnptx <dig> bound to human c1q compared to either the bsa or pbs control .

rtnptx <dig> binds e. coli
rtnptx <dig> was tested for ability to inhibit the growth of e. coli  or s. aureus  using the assay described for rs100a <dig>  no direct activity could be demonstrated. however, it has been reported that human ptx <dig> binds selected pathogens including pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium and aspergillus fumigatus  <cit> . to investigate the possibility that bovine rtnptx <dig> binds e. coli, the protein was bound to nitrocellulose in a slot blot and then probed with biotinylated e. coli. the slot blot showed that biotinylated e. coli in pbs bound to rtnptx <dig> but not the same quantity of bsa . biotinylated s. aureus  in pbs did not bind to the immobilised rtnptx <dig> .

discussion
the objective of this study was to characterise the host transcriptional response to intra-mammary infection with s. aureus, a gram-positive bacterial pathogen. we initially investigated the mrna expression levels of two major milk protein genes  in the udder tissue to confirm that transcripts encoding proteins involved in the major physiological function of the udder, milk protein production, were not affected by the experimental infection. these qrt-pcr measurements demonstrated that the limited experimental infection, in terms of infection time and dose, had not caused significant loss of function in the mammary tissue. thus, the experimental model measured changes in immune gene responses that are likely to be appropriate for the initial stages of infection.

transcript profiling was employed to analyse gene expression in mammary tissue challenged by s. aureus infection. initially, mrna levels of a number of genes , principally encoding proinflammatory cytokines, were measured. these genes showed significant dose-dependent up-regulation in all three cows subjected to intramammary infusion with s. aureus for a  <dig> h period. the dose dependent transcriptional responses probably directly reflect the dose of bacteria in the tissue and also, due to the lag phase in bacterial growth, different durations of inflammation in the tissue. this experiment also demonstrated that s. aureus intramammary infusion had generated an immune response that was self-contained within each udder quarter i.e. the experimental infection in one udder quarter did not affect gene expression in the adjacent control udder quarter. although tnfα mrna, measured by qrt-pcr, was up-regulated by the intramammary infusion of s. aureus, it has been reported that the protein was not detectable in milk from udders infected with s. aureus  <cit> . one possible explanation is that this apparent disparity reflects the differing sensitivities and dynamic ranges of the measurement technologies. another possibility is that the observed changes in mrna expression for tnfα do not accurately translate into corresponding secreted protein changes. this could occur when mrna translation or protein secretion were rate limiting in defining the quantity of tnfα in milk.

the reasons for the more accentuated responses in cow  <dig> are not clear but may reflect differing genetics underlying individual immune responsiveness or a different history of disease exposure. it is also possible that cow  <dig> had been primed for a stronger innate immune response as a result of a low level of asymptomatic pre-existing infection in one quarter prior to the experimental challenge, despite this quarter not being used in the experiment. however, the control quarter from this cow did not display increased expression of tnfα or il- <dig> relative to the controls from the other two cows, indicating that expression of genes in the control quarter from cow  <dig> was not systemically affected by a pre-existing mild infection in the unused adjacent quarter. another possibility is that the infection was not uniform in the udder quarter and sampling had occurred in regions from this animal that had a greater extent of infection.

previous studies have clearly demonstrated that mammary epithelial cells have a robust innate immune capability and thus the observed responses in infected mammary tissue probably reflect transcriptional changes in these cells as well as cellularity changes caused by infiltrating immune cells  <cit> . it might be expected that the predominant responses would be from the mammary epithelial cells at low infection rates and infiltrating immune cells at the higher doses as they respond to proinflammatory signals generated by the former cells. the relative dissection of these contributions awaits further investigation possibly involving immunolocalizations or in situ mrna localizations.

microarray transcript profiling identified two major clusters of differentially expressed genes: genes that were up-regulated and down-regulated after infusion of s. aureus into the mammary gland. the majority of the up-regulated genes encoded proteins involved in intercellular signalling and a large number of them were cytokines and chemokines . these proteins are intimately associated with inflammatory processes and are probably essential for the recruitment and activation of neutrophils into the infected mammary tissue  <cit> . the overflow of these cells into milk is a widely used marker of mastitis in dairy cows. the down-regulated genes encoded components of the cytoskeleton or extracellular matrix, mediators of apoptosis, cell surface receptors and intercellular signalling proteins. the former group suggests that tissue remodelling of the mammary tissue in response to infection was beginning to occur despite the maintenance of normal milk protein gene expression.

the up-regulated cluster also contained genes encoding proteins with less defined functions. two such genes, s100a <dig> and ptx <dig>  were investigated in greater detail as they have been previously implicated in inflammatory responses  <cit>  although their specific roles particularly in relation to bovine mammary tissue have not been defined. s100a <dig> and ptx <dig> mrnas were markedly up-regulated in bmec stimulated with lps and lta indicating that they may be involved in the initial response of mammary tissue to bacterial infection. however, the time courses of their responses were very different with ptx <dig> showing earlier up-regulation but unlike s100a <dig> it did not show a sustained response. thus, the time course responses of these two genes to the infection were dissimilar.

the s100a <dig> protein  triggers a signal transduction cascade that results in activation of the transcriptional co-regulator nf-κb and consequent expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . increased expression of s100a <dig> in bmec could amplify the pro-inflammatory response in infected mammary tissue and thereby promote the infiltration of neutrophils into the tissue. s100a <dig> is a small  calcium-binding protein. interestingly, its mrna sequence does not encode a signal sequence even though the protein is present externally to stimulated cells and there is a cell surface receptor, receptor for advanced glycation end products , for s100a <dig> on the surface of many cells  <cit> . one possibility is that s100a <dig> is released from cells by an undefined secretory mechanism. another possibility is that it is released from cells undergoing inflammation-induced cell death. the interaction between s100a <dig> and rage is thought to amplify and propagate the inflammatory response in endothelial cells through increased nf-κb activation and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. blockage of this interaction dampens the response by inhibiting the nuclear translocation of nf-κb  <cit> . rage is a multi-ligand member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules that binds to advanced glycation end products , proinflammatory cytokine-like mediators of the s100/calgranulin family, as well as amphoterin and amyloid-β-protein  <cit> . the presence and distribution of rage in mammary tissue is unknown.

s100a <dig> was present in milk samples from s. aureus-infected udder quarters and the level of the protein was dependent on the severity of infection. relatively low quantities of s100a <dig> were also found in the milk samples taken prior to the s. aureus challenge. interestingly, using an antigen capture elisa it was demonstrated that s100a <dig> levels in milk samples from the control udder quarters at  <dig> h post-infection showed a small but significant increase compared to the pre-infection control samples. thus, there was a small intermammary quarter effect of the infection but this was minor compared to the responses in the infected quarters. in a dairy herd there was significant correlation between the level of milk s100a <dig> and scc, a widely accepted indicator of mastitis. thus, s100a <dig> protein levels in milk could be used as an indicator of mastitis in dairy cattle.

the current study has also demonstrated that rs100a <dig> inhibited the growth of e. coli but not s. aureus in a dose-dependent manner . this novel finding suggests that s100a <dig> may have a direct role in protecting mammary tissue from infection by coliform bacteria and may play a role in protecting newborn suckling calves from bacterial infections. the detailed nature of this inhibitory activity is yet to be defined. the result is somewhat paradoxical in view of the up-regulation of the expression of this gene in bmec stimulated with lta, a gram positive bacterial cell wall component as well as lps, a gram negative bacterial cell wall component.

the long pentraxin, ptx <dig>  is a secreted multimeric glycoprotein that is thought to activate the immune system by directly binding selected micro-organisms and c1q, the first component of the classical pathway of complement activation  <cit> . indeed, ptx <dig> is a secreted pattern recognition receptor. the expression of bovine ptx <dig> mrna was strongly and rapidly up-regulated in bmec challenged with lps and lta and increased in mammary tissue from udders infected with s. aureus. thus, ptx <dig> has the characteristics of an innate immune protein. although no direct anti-bacterial activity could be demonstrated, rtnptx <dig> protein was able to directly bind e. coli. this result is consistent with a pattern recognition function of ptx <dig> that facilitates the immobilisation and display of micro-organisms. the decameric structure of ptx <dig>  particularly its disulphide bonded structure, is thought to underpin this activity  <cit> . the bovine recombinant protein also underwent oligomerisation . in addition, the current study demonstrated that recombinant bovine ptx <dig> bound human c1q, thereby physically linking the complement system with ptx3-bound bacteria, presumably promoting opsomization of the bacteria. at peak lactation only the alternative complement pathway is active in milk due the absence of c1q. therefore the actions of ptx <dig> probably operate only after inflammatory exudation of plasma components into milk  <cit> . the relatively rapid transcriptional response of bmec to lta is consistent with the view that ptx <dig> is a component of the immediate early response, where it acts to initially bind and coat bacteria, and subsequently activates the classical pathway of the complement system.

CONCLUSIONS
bovine s100a <dig> probably amplifies the inflammatory response via recruitment of neutrophils while bovine ptx <dig> activates the immune system by binding to c1q and selected pathogens. acting in concert, these proteins are likely to be important components of a multi-faceted response of mammary tissue to infection. these proteins may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment and prevention of mastitis. since s100a <dig> and ptx <dig> display microbial growth inhibition and binding properties, respectively, they could provide a new class of natural anti-microbial agents that could assist defense of the mammary gland against chronic and subclinical infections. the presence of these innate immune signalling proteins, amongst other cytokines, in milk may also be instructive for the maturation of the neonatal immune system and gut epithelium as well as influencing microbial colonisation of the neonatal gut.
