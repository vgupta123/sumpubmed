BACKGROUND
white rot fungi have been known to completely mineralize various biopolymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin  <cit> . laccase  is one of the enzymes involved in lignin degradation. it is a phenol oxidase catalyzing four-electron reduction of molecular oxygen to water with concomitant oxidation of a phenolic substrate. this multi-copper containing enzyme has three copper centers, namely, type  <dig>  type  <dig> and type  <dig> which are distinct in terms of their spectroscopic and physical properties. the final acceptor of electrons is molecular oxygen and this binds at the type  <dig> centre. the one electron oxidation in the beginning of the reaction generates a radical, which can undergo further enzyme-catalyzed oxidation or a non-enzymatic hydration or spontaneous disproportionation and/or may participate in polymerization reactions  <cit> . these activities can be applied in natural bioremediation processes. due to similarity in the structure of lignin with various aromatic compounds, laccases are seen as promising enzymes for  dye degradation in textile waste waters  wood composite production  bleaching in paper and pulp industry  <cit>  and, more recently,  bio-catalysis  <cit> .

the native fungi are slow growers and produce low amounts of laccase making the study and large-scale application of these enzymes difficult. also, one organism may produce isozymes of laccase with different substrate specificities. with the objective of studying individual enzymes and achieve higher expression, a number of fungal laccase genes have been expressed in eukaryotic hosts such as aspergilus niger kluyveromyces lactis, pichia methanolica, pichia pastoris, saccharomyces cerevisiae, trichoderma reesei and plant  cell lines. p. pastoris expression system has been widely used for heterologous production of laccase from botrytis aclada <cit> , ganoderma sp.en <dig> <cit> , fome lignosus <cit> , pleurotus sajor-caju <cit> , pycnoporus cinnabarinus <cit> , pycnoporus sanguineus <cit> , trametes sp.ah28- <dig>  <cit> , trametes sp.  <dig>  <cit> , trametes trogii <cit>  and trametes versicolor <cit>  indicating suitability of this system for laccase expression.

cyathus bulleri, a member of the family nidulariacea, has been previously reported to produce laccase with interesting biochemical properties  <cit> . the usefulness of this enzyme in degrading a variety of textile dyes has been shown  <cit> . the high  stability  of this laccase in a continuous membrane bioreactor  <cit> , designed for dye decolorization, makes this a promising enzyme for large scale application. in this paper, we describe the isolation and characterization of the full length cdna encoding this laccase. the laccase was expressed in p. pastoris under the control of alcohol oxidase  <dig> promoter. the purified recombinant protein  was biochemically characterized and properties relevant to applications compared with laccase  of the native fungus.

RESULTS
sequence analysis of cloned laccase
based on the  <dig> bp sequence obtained  <cit>  using primers raised against the internal peptide sequence of the nlac, race pcr strategy was used to isolate the complete cdna of laccase. for this,  <dig> h post-induction culture of c. bulleri was used for preparation of rna. the length of the coding sequence was  <dig>  bp and the gene encoding this protein was named as lcc. the von heijne  <cit>  signal sequence prediction was used to predict the start of the mature laccase. the predicted n-terminus matched with the reported n-terminal sequence  <cit>  of the matured protein. hydrophobic residues were found to be present in the central region of the putative signal peptide. no sequence similarity was observed in this pre-pro region with signal sequences of other laccases. the mature laccase polypeptide was predicted to be  <dig> amino acids long with a secretion peptide of  <dig> amino acids. the molecular weight, calculated on the basis of average isotopic masses of the amino acids, was  <dig>  da and the isoelectric point was  <dig> . the laccase contained four putative n-glycosylation sites , at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  two of the sites, at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  seem less likely to be glycosylated because of proline at c-terminal side of threonine  <cit> . multiple sequence alignment  with known laccases indicated high sequence identity with basidiomycete laccases as compared to the ascomycete laccases. highest sequence similarity  was observed with laccases from t. versicolor <cit>  and coprinus cinereus <cit> . all the expected cu ligands in laccases were strongly conserved: eight histidine residues in the highly conserved motif of four his-x-his repeats that coordinate the trinuclear type 2/type  <dig> copper ; additional four cysteines and histidine were also found to be strongly conserved  and are likely to be important in binding to type  <dig> copper site.

expression of cloned laccase in p. pastoris
the lcc gene was inserted into the p. pastoris expression vector ppiczα in frame with the α–factor secretion signal gene, under the control of the aox <dig> promoter. the construct was introduced into the yeast genome and extracellular expression of laccase was confirmed  by plate assay on  <dig> ′-azino-bis  or abts. a number of clones displayed green color on plates and this indicated correct processing of the signal sequence. all the laccase producing transformants were found to be mut+ . the clone ppiczα lcc- <dig>  which showed deepest green color on the plates, was chosen for expression studies in liquid medium . maximum laccase activity of  <dig> u- <dig> u l- <dig> was observed  <dig> days after initiation of induction by  <dig> % methanol. effect of addition of copper sulfate at different times, post induction, was investigated and maximum laccase activity of ~ <dig> u l- <dig> was obtained at salt concentration of  <dig>  mm . this represented an increase of about 12-fold over control cultures where no copper was added. the page-zymogram analysis of the concentrated culture filtrate, carried out on guaiacol, confirmed the expression of laccase in active form . for equal volume of concentrated culture filtrate loaded on the gel, omission of sds and β–mercaptoethanol in the loading buffer resulted in higher activity as judged on the gel .

purification and characterization of rlac
recombinant laccase expressed in p. pastoris was purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by chromatography on sephadex g <dig> and superdex g <dig> columns kept in tandem. a summary of the purification steps is shown in table  <dig>  a final specific activity of  <dig> u mg- <dig> was achieved representing a purification fold of ~ <dig>  a total enzyme yield of 24% was obtained. a single protein band was detected on sds-page indicating electrophoretic homogeneity of the sample  and a relative molecular mass of ~ <dig> kda was estimated. the mass of this purified rlac was slightly higher than the nlac  which has been reported to be of ~ <dig> kda  <cit> . the laccase activity of the purified band was confirmed by zymogram analysis using abts as a substrate, the oxidized radical of which was visualized as a green colored band . the gel showed diffused band with both nlac and rlac and most importantly, the higher molecular weight of the pichia expressed laccase was observed more clearly in the zymogram analysis . the spread of the rlac was more heterogeneous compared to the nlac. the same observations were made when the proteins were stained with a dye specific for glyco-proteins. the pichia expressed rlac moved at a higher position indicating higher molecular mass of this laccase . the ph and temperature optimum of the rlac were measured using abts as the substrate and found to be  <dig>  and 55°c respectively. for rlac, stability increased from ph  <dig> to  <dig> . the temperature stability was studied and half-life values were determined to be  <dig>  h ,  <dig>  h ,  <dig>  h ,  <dig>  h ,  <dig>  h  and  <dig>  h . these were much higher than the values reported earlier  <cit>  for the nlac which were  <dig> min ,  <dig> min ,  <dig> min  and  <dig> min . when stored at 4°c, rlac was as stable as the nlac. the kinetic parameters were determined for the rlac on abts, guaiacol and pyrogallol and compared with the values obtained with the nlac. similar values for km and vmax were obtained  indicating functional similarity of the pichia produced enzyme with that of the native fungus.

the effect of various water miscible organic solvents  and sparingly soluble solvents , commonly used for synthesis of aromatics, was investigated on laccase activity and the results are shown in figure  <dig>  both rlac and the nlac were stable in these solvents  up to 3h at 4%  concentration. however, at higher solvent concentration of 50% , differences were noted and nlac retained between 60-90% activity in water miscible solvents. the rlac was slightly less stable . in sparingly soluble solvents, both the native and the recombinant enzyme were inactivated by 90%. maximum inactivation of activity  occurred during either the first hour of incubation  or during the first two hours  after which the rates were stabilized. at 70% solvent level, both rlac and the nlac were inactivated. with chloride ions, the stability was monitored for  <dig> h and the data is shown in figure  <dig>  recombinant lac was found to be more stable at all concentrations of chloride compared to the nlac. in the high concentration range of 300– <dig> mm, more than 50% residual activity was observed.

maldi-tof ms and peptide mass fingerprint analysis of rlac and nlac
for identification of the rlac expressed in p. pastoris, tryptic in-gel digestion of the purified commassie stained band  was performed. masses of the tryptic fragments, determined by maldi-tof ms analysis, were compared to the masses obtained with the nlac and the spectra are shown in figure 6a  and figure 6b . the details of various peaks are provided in additional file 3: table s <dig> and additional file 4: table s <dig> respectively. since glycosylation affects only a few peptides, the theoretical peptides expected of this laccase on complete digestion with trypsin can be predicted and are given in additional file 5: table s <dig>  four of the peptides in the rlac at m/z values of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>   were identified and matched exactly with the peptides of m/z  <dig> ,  <dig>  +  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  obtained from the nlac . this confirmed that rlac was the same as the purified nlac. for rlac and the nlac, additional peptide fragments with m/z values of  <dig>   and  <dig> ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  ,  <dig>   were detected in addition to several un-identified peptides. glycomod tools  <cit>  were used for calculating the theoretical mass of the potential glycosylated tryptic fragments  and their possible structures. based on this, the peak observed at  <dig>  was identified to be of the peptide  <dig> davntggagdnvtir  <dig> with the assigned glycan structure of  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> . for the nlac, the tryptic fragment at m/z of  <dig>  was concluded to be  <dig> davntggagdnvtir  <dig> with the glycan structure of  <dig>  the details are provided in table  <dig> 

discussion
in the last few years laccases have been identified as important enzymes for application in the environment sector as well as for production of high value aromatics  <cit> . almost all laccases are produced at low levels in the native fungi. multiple isozymes of laccase have also been reported in numerous fungi making the study of individual enzymes difficult. cloning and expression of genes provides an opportunity to overproduce and study these enzymes individually. based on our previous studies  <cit> , wherein a laccase was purified from c. bulleri and investigated for its application in degradation of textile dyes, the cdna encoding this enzyme was isolated in the present study and expressed in p. pastoris. although many white-rot fungi exhibit multiple isozymes of laccase, we and others  <cit>  have only observed one laccase in c. bulleri. to isolate the full length cdna encoding this laccase, rlm-race technique was used. this method has been found to be very useful in isolating gene sequences using primers from the known and the conserved regions  <cit>  of the genes. primers were designed in the present study, based on the previously sequenced  <dig> bp sequence  <cit> , and used to obtain the complete coding sequence through the primer walking technique. a comparison of the complete protein sequence with other laccases indicated high similarity to basidiomycete laccases, especially in the copper binding regions, with all his and cys residues conserved. the internal peptide sequences reported  <cit>  for the nlac were identified in the rlac indicating that the cloned gene was that of the enzyme studied earlier. the reported  <cit>  n-terminus sequence of the laccase was also identified in the deduced amino acid sequence. it has been proposed  <cit>  that for type  <dig> copper ligand, residues located  <dig> amino acids downstream of the conserved cys affect the redox potential and this provides a basis for classification of laccase under class  <dig> , class  <dig>  or class  <dig>  the sequence lea adjacent to the last conserved his is conserved in laccases of high redox potential with ala at the most being replaced by other residues. this contrasts with the laccases of low redox potential which have a sequence of vsg replacing the lea tripeptide. the presence of leu at the type  <dig> copper binding position and lel tripeptide  suggests the c. bulleri laccase to be a high redox potential enzyme. moreover, the presence of glu  <dig> and ser  <dig> at the equivalent conserved positions further strengthens this hypothesis. the sequence also showed the presence of pre-sequence in agreement with its extracellular localization. the sequence conservation in this region between various fungi was observed to be poor indicating the use of different secretion peptides in different fungal species.

the c. bulleri laccase was expressed at a level of 600– <dig> u l- <dig> using ppiczαb yeast shuttle vector. in general, low heterologous expression of fungal laccase has been reported in p. pastoris  compared to the expression levels in the native fungi. enhancement in extracellular laccase activity has been reported by addition of copper sulfate  <cit>  to the culture medium of p. pastoris. mutagenesis of the structural gene followed by expression in p. pastoris also lead to enhanced expression of trametes sp. ah <dig> - <dig> laccase  <cit> . in the present work, optimization of the time of addition and concentration of copper salt lead to an increase in laccase activity to ~ <dig> u l- <dig> in  <dig> days. while this effect of copper has been reported at the level of transcription, mediated by copper-dependent responsive element in some fungi  <cit> , no such effect is expected in the recombinant p. pastoris as the laccase gene is transcribed under the control of the aox <dig> promoter. addition of copper salts in the medium does not affect extracellular laccase activity in the native c. bulleri either . since laccases are metallo-proteins, it is likely that the addition of copper allows the excreted laccase in p. pastoris to fold correctly in the culture filtrate.

the rlac appeared as a  <dig> ±  <dig> kda protein, slightly higher and more heterogeneous when compared to the nlac   <cit>  and these differences were attributed to increased glycosylation of the rlac in p. pastoris . while the kinetic parameters against abts, guaiacol and pyrogallol were found to be similar  for the native and the rlac, the latter was found to be more thermo-stable. this thermo-stability is likely to be on account of higher glycosylation in p. pastoris. it has been proposed that the glycans, being highly hydrophilic in nature, contribute to the stability by associating covalently to the amino acid residues present on the surface of the protein molecules  <cit> . the higher stability is expressed by higher melting temperature. the recent work on the engineered sh <dig> domain variants also clearly suggested that glycosylation can enrich as well as modulate the biophysical properties of proteins and could, in fact, be used as an alternative way to design thermally stabilized proteins  <cit> . in this study, we can also correlate the tolerance to organic solvents as a by-product of this altered glycosylation pattern. as observed, the rlac produced in p. pastoris exhibited higher tolerance towards various water-miscible organic solvents compared to the native laccases from t. versicolor and pleurotus ostreatus <cit> . between 40-60% residual activity was observed at 50%  in all these solvents after  <dig> h of incubation. while these values were slightly lower than those observed for the nlac , these are still high and useful for its use in organic synthesis work. interestingly, both the rlac and the nlac were equally unstable in thf which is likely to have distorted the enzyme hydration and distort the conformation leading to a drastic decrease in enzyme activity. it has been observed that laccase structure, stability and activity are affected by water miscible solvents through direct interaction with enzyme and through its affect on water activity   <cit> . although farnet et al.  <cit>  have observed a high ic <dig> values  of the marasmius quercophilus laccase in different solvents but the enzyme was not incubated for longer time periods and thus their data cannot be compared to our results.

laccases are generally inhibited by chloride ions, an important component in dye wastewaters, which limits its use in treatment plants. chloride ions directly affect the conversion process through their intrinsic effects on rate constants mediated through availability of type  <dig> and type  <dig> copper atoms in the active site  <cit> . higher resistance to chloride ions  was observed for the rlac of c. bulleri  when compared to the nlac. a chloride tolerant laccase having ic <dig> of  <dig>  m was recently reported  <cit>  but again, the enzyme was not incubated for long time periods and hence cannot be compared to the laccase expressed in this study.

for many of the differences observed between the rlac and the nlac, a detailed comparison of the trypsin digested peptide fragments was made. several peptides were found to be identical confirming the expression of the same laccase in p. pastoris, as reported previously from our group. out of the  <dig> putative glycosylation sites, only  <dig> were likely to get glycosylated  <cit> . differences in the glycosylation patterns, leading to generation of a spectrum of different peptides, were observed. software tools were used to identify these and the fragment with m/z of  <dig>   was concluded to represent the aa sequence 442– <dig> with possible glycan structure of  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  the corresponding fragment from the nlac was identified at  <dig>  m/z with an assigned structure of  <dig>  while theoretically, additional peptide  is predicted to undergo glycosylation and may indeed do so, this is not likely to be detected by maldi-tof ms, as the size of this exceeds the detection limits of the system.

CONCLUSIONS
the full length cdna sequence of c. bulleri laccase is reported in this paper. the gene was efficiently expressed under the control of the aox <dig> promoter and secreted in the culture supernatant of p. pastoris . sequence analysis indicated this to code for a high redox laccase. optimization of the time of addition and concentration of copper salts resulted in laccase activity of ~ <dig> u l- <dig>  the laccase was purified to homogeneity and found to be of a higher mol wt compared to the nlac. an investigation of biochemical properties of the rlac indicated it to possess higher thermo-stability and tolerance towards chloride ions compared to the nlac. a comparison of the peptide mass fingerprint data with the nlac indicated presence of fragments, not observed in the nlac, which were attributed to different pattern of glycosylation in the p. pastoris and which are likely to have contributed to the observed differences in some biochemical properties. the data indicate usefulness of the rlac over the nlac in specific areas of applications.
