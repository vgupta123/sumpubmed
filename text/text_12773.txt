BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small non-coding rnas  that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level  <cit> . through binding complementarily to 3′ untranslated regions , coding sequences, or 5′ utrs, mirna suppress the translation of target mrna molecules, and thereby silence target gene expression . mirnas are generated in all eukaryotes and viruses  <cit> , and many mirnas are conserved among related species  <cit> . since the first mirna was reported to regulate the timing of development in caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> , numerous mirnas have been identified from animals, plants, and viruses. in the last two decades, thousands of mirnas have been isolated from insect species, including drosophila melanogaster  <cit> , bombyx mori  <cit> , manduca sexta , plutella xylostella  <cit> , and helicoverpa armigera  <cit> . functional studies carried out in these insect species have demonstrated that insect mirnas play very important regulatory roles in various biological processes, such as development, immune responses, metabolism, and host-pathogen interactions  <cit> .

the cotton aphid, aphis gossypii glover , is an important insect pest in cotton and cucurbit crops that causes economic damage both through direct feeding and through the transmission of viruses  <cit> . given that a. gossypii has a very wide host range that encompasses least  <dig> species  <cit> , this pest encounters multiple plant toxic chemicals that are produced by host plants to defend against herbivores. these compounds have strong deleterious effects on herbivorous insects by affecting the growth and development or even by directly causing mortality  <cit> . in humans and large mammals, increasing evidence suggests that mirnas play very important roles in the metabolism of xenobiotic compounds  <cit> . such mirnas can mediate the detoxification metabolism of xenobiotics by regulating the expression of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes and nuclear receptors  <cit> . for example, human p <dig> cyp1a <dig>  which is involved in the metabolism of carcinogenic metabolites, was found to be post-transcriptionally regulated by mir-892a  <cit> . in addition, previous studies carried out in mosquitoes culex pipiens suggested that mirnas participate in the resistance to pyrethroid insecticides by mediating the expression levels of p <dig> genes  <cit> . while there are a lot known about the mirnas that participate in regulating the detoxification of xenobiotics in animals and mirnas likely have essential roles in insecticide resistance, less is understood about the regulatory roles of mirnas in the metabolism of plant allelochemicals in insects.

in the present study, five small rna libraries were built from apterous a. gossypii adults fed on artificial diets that contained various plant allelochemicals  and control. a total of  <dig>  million clean reads was obtained by deep sequencing, and  <dig> mirnas were identified from the five sample libraries. in order to identify putative allelochemical metabolism-related mirnas, the expression levels of both conserved and novel mirnas were compared among the five libraries, and the targets of the newly identified mirnas were predicted. the results of this study deepen our understanding of the regulatory roles of mirnas in a. gossypii and indicate that mirnas are likely involved in the insect metabolism of plant allelochemicals.

RESULTS
deep sequencing of a. gossypii small rna libraries
in order to examine the potential role of small rnas in a. gossypii responses to plant allechemicals, we collected apterous a. gossypii adults that had been fed artificial diet containing various allechemicals for 24 h for small rna sequencing. five a. gossypii small rna libraries were constructed and sequenced using the illumina sequencing platform. a total of  <dig>  million raw reads was obtained from the five libraries, and after filtering out sequences shorter than  <dig> nt and filtering the lower quality reads from the raw data,  <dig>  million quality reads were obtained. the number of clean reads differed among the five libraries; more clean reads  were obtained from the 2-tridecanone-fed library than from any of the other four libraries  . the length of these small rnas ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> nt. in all five libraries, the highest peak for nucleotide length distribution was that for  <dig> nt .table  <dig> total number of reads obtained from the small rna libraries from aphids fed artificial diet containing various plant allechemicals

identification of conserved and novel mirnas, and analysis of their features
to identify potential candidate mirnas from the a. gossypii sample libraries, the raw sequencing data were analyzed with mirdeep <dig> software. the acyrthosiphon pisum genome was used as a reference because the a. gossypii genome was not available at the time of the analysis. total of  <dig> unique mirna candidates were identified from among the five libraries, including  <dig> conserved mirnas and  <dig> potentially novel mirnas. the newly identified mirnas of a. gossypii were named by prefixed with “ago”, where “ago” means a. gossypii. the length and copy number distribution analysis of these newly identified mirnas indicated that the mirnas of  <dig> nt in length were the most abundant , and the mirnas of 21– <dig> nt in length accounted for more than 81% of reads . further, we analyzed the common and unique distribution of the newly identified mirnas from among the five libraries. the results demonstrated that  <dig> mirnas were common among the five libraries; only a few of the mirnas were uniquely expressed in a particular library .table  <dig> length distribution and copy number of a. gossypii mirnas




since the dominance of uracil at the first position of the 5′ terminus terminal is considered to be one of the conserved features of mature mirnas  <cit> , and given that the first base toward the 5′ end of mirnas is known to play very important roles in the interaction between mirnas and argonaute complexes  <cit> , the position-specific nucleotide occurrence of the candidate mirna sequences was analyzed. a. gossypii mirnas showed a nucleotide bias towards uracil  at the first nucleotide position . in addition, the base composition of the mirnas at each position was analyzed, and the nucleotide u was the most abundant nucleotide at most of the positions; this was especially pronounced at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> .fig.  <dig> the position-specific nucleotide occurrence of a. gossypii mature mirnas. uracil dominated the first nucleotide position towards the 5′ end of mirnas




a. gossypii mirnas differentially expressed following allelochemical treatments
to identify the mirnas that may play important roles in the responses of a. gossypii against plant alleochemicals, the differential expression of the identified mirnas were analyzed using edger software. the expression values as assessed by mirdeep <dig> were used to analyze differential expression of a. gossypii mirnas, and the mirnas that had read counts of more than  <dig> in all five libraries were selected for differential expression analysis. compared to the aphids fed on a  <dig>  m sucrose solution ,  <dig> mirnas were found to be differentially expressed in the aphids fed on diet containing allelochemicals . of these, following for aphids feeding on gossypol, 2-tridecanone, quercetin, and tannic acid for 24 h, there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas, respectively . interestingly, we found that most of the differentially expressed mirnas were up-regulated in the aphids treated with gossypol, quercetin, and 2-tridecanone, but that the mirnas from the tannic acid treated aphids possessed the tendency of down-regulation .fig.  <dig> differential expressions of a. gossypii mirnas after feeding on various allelochemicals for 24 h. a expression of conserved mirnas. b expression of novel mirnas. green color represents low expression levels and red color represents the high expression levels of the mirnas

the expression levels of these mirnas were dysregulated among five libraries. for instance, ago-mir-2997-5p expression was low in the control and quercetin treatment libraries and was not detected in the 2-tridecanone or tannic acid treatment, but was up-regulated in the gossypol library . although the expression patterns of most of the mirnas differed among the various allelochemical treatments, several mirnas were consistently up/down-regulated in all four of the allelochemical treatment libraries. for instance, compared to the control, the expressions of some mirnas  were up-regulated in all four of the allelochemical treatments . while the expression levels of ago-let-7-5p, ago-mir-100-5p, ago-mir-44b-3p, ago-mir-7054-3p, ago-mir-4021-3p, ago-mir-656a-3p, ago-mir-4661a-3p, and ago-mir-2238j-3p were down-regulated in all four treatment libraries in compare with the control . it is worth nothing that ago-mir-7475a-5p expression was not detected in the control library, but was expressed in each of the allelochemical treatment libraries .table  <dig> the read counts and sequences of a. gossypii mirnas that had increased expression following plant allelochemical treatment

to verify the expression analysis results from the sequencing experiments ,  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas were selected, and their expression levels were measured via qrt-pcr analysis. five of the selected mirnas showed similar expression patterns as those assessed using sequencing read counts . in the sequencing results, the expression of ago-mir-2179-5p was up-regulated, and ago-let-7-5p was down-regulated in all of the allelochemicals treatment libraries, and the qrt-pcr analysis showed similar results . the qrt-pcr results for ago-mir-3051- <dig> agreed with the sequencing results: it was highly expressed when apterous a. gossypii adults fed on an artificial diet containing  <dig> % tannic acid . the expression level of ago-mir-5468a as measured by qrt-pcr was different from that as assessed by the sequencing read count, the reason for this discrepancy is unknown.fig.  <dig> differential expressions of mirnas following plant allelochemical treatment. the results are presented as mean ± sd for three independent replicates. different letters on the bars of the histogram indicate significant differences based on anova followed by tukey’s hsd multiple comparison test 




prediction of the putative target genes of the mirnas
to further understand the role of the various mirnas identified in a. gossypii, the putative targets of these identified mirnas were computationally predicted. the miranda and rnahybrid programs were used to identify the targets of these mirnas from an a. gossypii transcriptome database. combining the results of these two target prediction programs, a total of  <dig> genes were putatively targeted by  <dig> mirnas from a. gossypii. go annotation of these target genes included the following categories: cellular components, molecular function, and biological process. about  <dig> % of the predicted target genes were classified into the biological process category, including cellular process , metabolic process , and biological regulation  .

to characterize the potential roles of a. gossypii mirnas in the defense responses against allelochemicals, we focused our attention to the predicted target genes that were likely to be involved in xenobiotic metabolism. interestingly, we found that several mirnas were targeted to genes that are known to play very important roles in insect responses to xenobiotic stress, including cytochrome p450s, acetylcholinesterases, glutathione s-transferases, sodium channel proteins, etc. . several mirnas were predicted to have many target genes, and numerous genes were putatively targeted by multiple mirnas. for instance, ago-mir-4467a- <dig> and ago-mir-4973-5p- <dig> were found have many predicted target genes, and cyp6j <dig> was putatively targeted by ago-mir-656a-3p, ago-mir-669c-5p, and ago-mir-4172-3p . in addition, some of these mirnas, which were putatively targeted to xenobiotic metabolism-related genes, were differently expressed following allelochemical treatment, including ago-mir-3191-3p, ago-mir-8798a, and ago-mir-656a-3p .table  <dig> putative xenobiotic metabolism-related target genes of a. gossypii mirnas




validation of the target prediction
the target prediction results were validated by selecting a cascading of ago-mir-656a-3p and cyp6j <dig>  to determine whether or not ago-mir-656a-3p could bind to the 3′ utr of cyp6j <dig> and suppress the expression of cyp6j <dig>  the 3′ utr of cyp6j <dig> containing the target site of ago-mir-656a-3p was inserted into a pmirglo vector to yield a recombined vector, pmirglo-cyp6j1-utr. the results of dual luciferase reporter assay showed that the firefly luciferase activity normalized to renilla was significantly reduced after pmirglo-cyp6j1-utr was co-transfected with ago-mir-656a-3p agomir in comparison with the negative mimic control; while the co-transfection of ago-mir-656a-3p agomir with control vector  did not decrease the relative activity of luciferase .fig.  <dig> interaction between ago-mir-656a-3p and cyp6j <dig> using a dual fluorescent reporter system. a predicted target sites of ago-mir-656a-3p in the 3′ utr of cyp6j <dig>  b luciferase reporter assays performed by co-transfection of ago-mir-656a-3p agomir with a luciferase reporter gene linked to the 3′ utr of cyp6j <dig>  firefly luciferase activity was normalized to renilla luciferase activity and then normalized to the activity of the control group. the mathematical operators of “+”and “−” mean add and subtract. different letters on the bars of the histogram indicate significant differences based on anova followed by tukey’s hsd multiple comparison test 




discussion
allelochemicals are very important plant natural products that are known to play essential roles in plant defense responses to herbivores. previous studies have shown that allelochemicals have great impacts on herbivorous insects. for example, detrimental effects were observed when h. armigera larvae were exposed to a high concentration of gossypol  <cit> . similarly, naringenin and quercetin have been reported to cause detrimental effects in the pea aphid, a. pisum, by effecting development, fecundity, and mortality  <cit> . as a very important polyphagous pest, cotton aphids encounter multiple allelochemicals in their life cycles, including gossypol, quercetin, and tannic acid. there is no doubt that allelochemicals have great effects on a. gossypii; for example, gao et al. found that higher levels of gossypol adversely affected the development, longevity, and reproduction of a. gossypii  <cit> . mirnas have been demonstrated to play very important regulatory roles in many biological processes over last few years. therefore, it is reasonable to conjecture that small rna molecules potentially function in regulatory roles in cotton aphid responses to plant allelochemicals. the identification and analysis of the expression profiles of mirnas in allelochemical treated a. gossypii can potentially provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms underlying insect detoxification of plant allelochemicals. the present study was undertaken to identify the conserved and novel mirnas of a. gossypii and to investigate the potential regulatory roles of these mirnas in the metabolism of allelochemicals.

with the development of high throughput sequencing technology, small rna sequencing has become a popular experimental approach to identifying mirnas from a range of organisms. sattar et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> mirnas in a. gossypii fed on susceptible and resistant  melon plants. in the present study, we sequenced five small rna libraries and identified  <dig> mirnas from a. gossypii fed on various allelochemicals; our sequencing data greatly expands the scope of the resources available to study a. gossypii mirnas. the size distribution pattern of the clean reads revealed that the five libraries were dominated by  <dig> nt sequences , a result consistent with the known characteristics of mirna  <cit> . the overall length distribution observed of the a. gossypii mirna in this study was similar to distributions observed in several other insect species, including blattella germanica  <cit>  and apis mellifera  <cit> .

our expression analysis based on read counts showed that  <dig> mirnas were differentially expressed in the allelochemical-treated aphids, as compared to the control aphids, which clearly suggests that allelochemicals affect mirna expression, thus implying a possible role for mirnas in the regulation of the metabolism of allelochemicals in a. gossypii.

our results showed that several mirnas were up/down regulated in all four allelochemicals libraries, and these mirnas may play important roles in the metabolism of plant allelochemicals in a. gossypii. for instance, mir-92b was up-regulated in all four allelochemical libraries, and suggests that mir-92b may involve in the response of a. gossypii to plant allelochemicals. in other insect species, mir-92b has been reported to be involved in multiple biological processes. in drosophila, mir-92b plays an important role in muscle development  <cit> , and is essential for neuroblast self-renewal  <cit> . meanwhile, mir-92b was classified as a stress responsive marker in eurosta solidaginis  <cit> .

in the present study, the expression levels of ago-let-7-5p and ago-mir-100-5p were down-regulated following allelochemical treatment. let- <dig> and mir- <dig> are basic components of the let-7-complex , which is required for the development of normal morphology in d. melanogaster  <cit> . given that allelochemicals can have great effects on insect development  <cit> , the differential expression of let- <dig> and mir- <dig> might be attributable to the influence of plant allelochemicals. the similar phenomenon was also observed in the host adaption of myzus persicae to nicotianae by the let- <dig> and mir- <dig> participating in regulating of the expression of cyp6cy <dig> post-transcriptionally  <cit> . further, sattar et al. found that when apterous cotton aphids fed on vat
− melon with high susceptibility to aphids, the expression levels of let- <dig> and mir- <dig> were decreased in compare with the aphids that fed on resistant  melon  <cit> . these results suggest that let- <dig> and mir- <dig> might be involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics of a. gossypii.

to further understand the possible roles of mirnas in the metabolism of plant allelochemicals, the putative target genes of the newly identified mirnas were predicted, and many of the predicted target genes were annotated to be involved in multiple biological processes. in addition, we found that several mirnas were predicted to target genes from families known to be important in the metabolism of xenobiotics  <cit> . combining these results of the target prediction with our differential expression analysis, we found that some of the mirnas predicted to target these xenobiotic metabolism-related genes were among the differentially express mirnas. this suggested that mirnas may be involved in insect metabolism of plant allelochemicals by regulating the expression of xenobitic metabolism genes.

CONCLUSIONS
a total of  <dig> mirnas was identified from a. gossypii, and the expression analysis results demonstrated that the transcript levels of these mirnas were changed depend on the plant allelochemicals feeding by a. gossypii. the results of target prediction suggest that mirnas may be involved in the metabolism of plant allelochemicals of a. gossypii, and these results represent an important new small rna genomics resource for further studies on this topic.
