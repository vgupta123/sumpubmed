BACKGROUND
histophilus somni is a commensal or opportunistic pathogen of the reproductive and respiratory tracts of cattle. h. somni was initially identified as the etiologic agent of bovine thrombotic meningoencephalitis , but also causes bovine shipping fever pneumonia, either independently or in association with mannheimia haemolytica and pasteurella multocida. pneumonia and myocarditis are currently the most commonly reported diseases due to h. somni  <cit> . infections resulting in abortion, infertility, arthritis, septicemia, and mastitis can also be caused by h. somni with varying degrees of frequency and severity in cattle  <cit> . similar disease conditions associated with strains of h. somni have been described in sheep  <cit> . relatively less pathogenic and/or avirulent variants of h. somni have also been isolated from cattle, most frequently from the mucosal surfaces of the genital tract  <cit> .

numerous in vitro and in vivo studies during the pre-genomic era have shed light on the differences in virulence properties between h. somni pathogenic isolates from sick animals and serum-sensitive commensal isolates from the genital tract  <cit> . however, thus far only a few genes involved in lipooligosaccharide  biosynthesis and serum-resistance have been identified in h. somni using dna/dna and dna/protein comparisons  <cit> . h. somni pneumonia strain  <dig> and preputial strain 129pt have been comprehensively characterized phenotypically and have been analyzed in several comparative studies  <cit> . however, a comprehensive understanding of the genetic basis that determines the phenotypic variability among h. somni stains is necessary to gain further insights into their pathogenicity.

comparative  analysis of bacterial genomes is a powerful tool for the prediction and/or identification of biochemical differences, virulence attributes, pathogenic ability, and adaptive evolution among related species/strains  <cit> . among the pasteurellaceae, the genomes of one or more species pathogenic to humans or animals from the genera actinobacillus, haemophilus, mannheimia, pasteurella, and others have been sequenced. the availability of these genome sequences has facilitated whole genome comparisons that have provided insights into the physiology and pathogenic evolution of the corresponding bacteria  <cit> .

horizontal gene transfer  plays a critical role in driving the evolution of pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . reduction in genome size  can occur as a result of continuous loss of genetic material due to gene deletion and/or mutation followed by dna erosion  <cit> . previous analyses by biochemical and pulsed field gel electrophoresis indicated that h. somni strains  <dig> and 129pt have common ancestry, but are non-clonal  <cit> . the following mechanisms may have engendered the genetic differences between these strains:  only one strain acquired genes by hgt while the other one did not;  only one strain lost genes by deletion/mutation and underwent 'reductive evolution';  both strains independently and continuously acquired and lost genes, and the net loss or gain of genes is a determinant of their divergent evolution;  gene convergence and the accumulation of synonymous and/or nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions occurred across the genomes of the two strains.

the rationale for the present study was to determine, using whole genome sequencing and comparative genomics, the mechanisms responsible for genetic variability between the two strains. it was also envisaged that a comparative genomics and bioinformatics approach would facilitate identification of h. somni genes putatively involved in virulence and pathogenesis.

methods
genomic dna  from h. somni strain  <dig> was purified using the puregene protocol . the shotgun sequencing phase for this genome required ~ <dig>  sequence reads to reach 8-fold coverage  <cit> . library construction, template preparation, sequencing, assembly, and data analyses were performed as described previously  <cit> . the sequence data assembled with phred-phrap were viewed using consed to assess data quality and design closure experiments. consed was also used to identify putative repeat regions so that the problems associated with assembling these regions could be resolved by way of combinatorial pcr experiments to isolate the repeat sequences on pcr amplicons. the location and exact sequence of each repeat was confirmed by isolating pcr fragments that contained each repeat in its entirety, followed by primer walking across the pcr product.

for initial gap closure, single primer amplification of contig ends , which is similar to the single-primer pcr procedure for rapid identification of transposon insertion sites, was used  <cit> . additional primers were designed, as necessary, to verify the correct assembly of contigs by confirmatory pcr. simultaneously, a fosmid library was constructed for scaffolding purposes using the vector pcc1fos  with  <dig> kb inserts. sequencing of the fosmids was necessary to close gaps across sequences that occur more than once in the genome, such as those of insertion sequences and ribosomal genes. gaps that were not closed by space-walking were closed using the sequence of h. somni strain 129pt as a scaffold and the reads were assembled with parallel phrap . gap closure at this stage was also facilitated by autofinish  <cit> . possible mis-assemblies were corrected with dupfinisher  <cit>  or transposon bombing of bridging clones  <cit>  using an ez::tnâ„¢ kit . the national human genome research institute standards for the human genome project  were followed for h. somni to obtain sufficient quality genomic data.

final automated annotation of the genome of strain  <dig> was performed at the oak ridge national laboratory using methods similar to those used to annotate the strain 129pt genome  <cit> . briefly, protein domains were identified by comparing each predicted protein against a hidden markov model protein family database  <cit> . to estimate the number of proteins specific to each strain, the smith-waterman algorithm  <cit>  was used to compare all predicted proteins from strain 129pt against those from strain  <dig> and vice-versa. proteins deemed to be specific to each strain were compared against the ncbi non-redundant protein database to determine whether they were hypothetical or conserved hypothetical. the translated orf was named a hypothetical protein if there was less than 25% identity or an aligned region was less than 25% of the predicted protein length. prediction of the number of subsystems and pairwise blast comparisons of protein sets within strains  <dig> and 129pt were carried out with the rapid annotation using subsystems technology , which is a fully automated, prokaryotic genome annotation service  <cit> . this platform identifies trna and rrna genes using the tools trnascan-se and "search_for_rnas", respectively  <cit> .

multiple genome comparisons were performed using the 'progressive alignment' option available in the program mauve version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . default scoring and parameters were used for generating the alignment. a synteny plot was generated using the program nucmer, which creates a dot plot based on the number of identical alignments between two genomes  <cit> . prophage regions  were identified using prophinder http://aclame.ulb.ac.be/tools/prophinder/, an algorithm that combines similarity searches, statistical detection of phage-gene enriched regions, and genomic context for prophage prediction  <cit> . identification and annotation of genomic islets/islands  other than prophages were performed based on sequence composition bias and comparative genomic analysis  <cit> . briefly, differences in the gc content, the occurrence of 'cornerstone genes' , and/or a continuous stretch of genes encoding hypothetical proteins were used as reference points for detection of gis. insertion sequences  were identified by whole genome blastx analysis of strains  <dig> and 129pt using the is finder http://www-is.biotoul.fr/. gene acquisition and loss among the two strains was determined by comparing gene order, orientation of genes , gc content of genes , features of intergenic regions , and the similarity of proteins encoded by genes at a locus of interest . putative horizontally transferred genes  were compiled using the integrated microbial genomes  system http://img.jgi.doe.gov. this system uses not only the best hit , but also all the matches that have bitscores equal to or greater than that of the best hit to identify putative htgs  <cit> . dna and protein sequences were aligned using the clustalw http://www.ebi.ac.uk/tools/clustalw2/index.html and boxshade http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/box_form.html programs as described previously  <cit> .

RESULTS
properties of the chromosomes
the size of the h. somni strain  <dig> chromosome was  <dig> , <dig> bp, and was larger than the chromosomes of the related bacteria haemophilus ducreyi strain 35000hp , haemophilus influenzae strain rd kw <dig> , h. influenzae strain 86-028np , h. somni strain 129pt , neisseria gonorrhoeae strain fa  <dig> , neisseria meningitidis serogroup a strain z <dig> , and p. multocida strain pm <dig> . however, the chromosome of h. somni strain  <dig> was smaller than that of haemophilus parasuis sh <dig> , n. meningitidis serogroup b strain mc <dig> , actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae l <dig> , aggregatibacter aphrophilus nj <dig> , mannheimia succiniciproducens strain mbel55e , and m. haemolytica strain baa- <dig> . although the chromosomes of the two h. somni strains differ in size by ~ <dig>  bp, their average gc content, gene density , and percentage of the sequence  that encodes proteins were similar . h. somni strain  <dig> did not contain plasmids, but h. somni strain 129pt contained a single plasmid  <cit> . some of the other relevant features of the chromosomes of h. somni strains  <dig> and 129pt are shown in table  <dig> 

*subsystems predicted by rast server  <cit> .

whole genome alignment using mauve showed the presence of extensive blocks of homologous regions, which is typical of closely related genomes . to further dissect their co-linearity, a blastn comparison of the two genomes was performed at the joint genome institute web site. this analysis indicated that there were  <dig> homologous regions  and the average nucleic acid identity among these homologous regions was  <dig> % . the plus/plus homologous regions refer to those present on the forward strand in both strains , and the plus/minus homologous regions refer to those present on the reverse strand in strain 129pt in relation to those present on the forward strand in strain  <dig> . several large gaps, translocations, and inversions became visible in the alignment generated by nucmer . detailed sequence examination revealed that some of these gaps and/or inversions were associated with integrative and conjugative elements.

comparison of prophage regions and genomic islands
prophinder predicted four prs in strain  <dig>  but only one in strain 129pt . pr i of strain  <dig> was the shortest and had homology to  <dig> segments totaling ~ <dig>  bp of bacteriophage hp <dig> of h. influenzae . the gc content of all four prs from strain  <dig>  was higher than that of the overall genome . pr ii of strain  <dig>  which had the highest gc content  among the four prs, also contained a  <dig>  bp segment  with homology to a region within the genome of h. influenzae strain  <dig> . pr iii of strain  <dig> was the longest and contained  <dig> orfs of unknown function . the genome of h. parasuis strain sh <dig> contained several short sequences that had homology to this region . pr iv of strain  <dig> was the most conspicuous and contained at least  <dig> orfs encoding putative proteins related to bacteriophage structural components. pr iv contained homology to a region of the genome of h. influenzae strain 86-028np . furthermore, the p <dig> family lysogenic bacteriophage phi-mhaa1-phl <dig> from m. haemolytica serotype a <dig> contained some of the orfs found within pr iv of strain  <dig> 

pr i of strain 129pt was  <dig>  bp shorter than pr iii of strain  <dig>  but the two prs had a similar gc content. a blastn analysis indicated that a sequence of ~ <dig>  bp was conserved between pr i of strain 129pt and pr iii of strain  <dig> . a two-way comparison indicated that an  <dig>  bp segment  within pr iii, and a  <dig>  bp segment from the 5' side of pr iii of strain  <dig> were absent in strain 129pt . a similar comparison indicated that a  <dig>  bp segment  within pr i, and a  <dig>  bp segment from the 3' side of pr i, of strain 129pt were absent in strain  <dig> . bacteriophages within the prophinder database containing some of the predicted orfs from prs i-iv of strain  <dig> and pr i of strain 129pt are shown in figure  <dig> 

manual curation indicated that strains  <dig> and 129pt contained  <dig> and  <dig> gis, comprising a total of  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively . gi i of strain  <dig> contained  <dig> orfs of unknown function and a similar sequence was not found in strain 129pt or other members of the pasteurellaceae. gi ii of strain  <dig> was the longest, had a higher gc content  than the overall genome, and contained  <dig> orfs of unknown function. the genome of p. multocida strain pm <dig> contained several short sequences that had homology to this region . gi iii of strain  <dig> contained  <dig> orfs encoding putative transposases .

gi i of strain 129pt contained an orf encoding a resolvase/integrase-like protein  and  <dig> orfs of unknown function. a similar sequence was not found in strain  <dig>  but h. parasuis strain sh <dig> contained several short sequences with homology to this region . gi ii of strain 129pt contained an orf encoding a putative phage dna primase-like protein  and  <dig> orfs of unknown function. a similar sequence was not found in strain  <dig> or other members of the pasteurellaceae. gi iii of strain 129pt contained orfs encoding a putative phage terminase protein , a prophage regulatory element , an integrase , and  <dig> orfs of unknown function. a similar sequence was not found in strain  <dig>  but aggregatibacter aphrophilus strain nj <dig> contained several short sequences that had homology to this region . all predicted orfs from gis iv and v of strain 129pt were of unknown function and strain  <dig> contained several short sequences that had homology to these regions . the chromosome of strain  <dig> had no regions of homology to gi vi of strain 129pt, but h. parasuis strain sh <dig> contained several short sequences that had homology to this region .

comparison of insertion sequences
insertion sequence finder indicated that strains  <dig> and 129pt contained several is elements distributed throughout the chromosomes. not surprisingly, some of these is elements were found within the prs and/or gis described above. insertion sequence  <dig> , consisting of a transposase  flanked by 18- <dig> bp of terminal inverted repeats, is a member of the is <dig> superfamily  <cit> . strain  <dig> contained  <dig> full-length  and three truncated copies of is <dig>  gi iii of strain  <dig> included  and one of the three truncated copies of is <dig>  strain 129pt contained  <dig> full-length copies of is <dig> . a gene in strain 129pt , encoding a choline kinase that is necessary for the synthesis of phosphorylcholine  <cit> , appeared to be interrupted due to an insertion-excision event involving is <dig>  since two partial homologs of the transposase gene occurred upstream of lica.

strain  <dig> contained  <dig> full-length members of the family is200/is <dig> . strain 129pt contained  <dig> full-length  and  <dig> truncated  members of the family is200/is <dig>  pr i of strain 129pt included . strain  <dig> contained a full-length member of the family is <dig>  and a truncated member of the family is1182/is <dig> . strain  <dig> contained a full-length member of the family is <dig> , whereas strain 129pt contained a truncated copy of the same orf . strain  <dig> also contained truncated members of the family is <dig> . the closest homologs of h. somni is200/is <dig> and is <dig> elements were found in m. haemolytica  and h. influenzae . however, the closest homologs of the is <dig> element from strain  <dig> were found in a. pleuropneumoniae  and h. parasuis .

blast comparison of protein sets
strains  <dig> and 129pt contained  <dig> predicted protein coding genes in common . in strain  <dig>   <dig> orfs could not be assigned a function based on blast analysis and were therefore annotated as encoding hypothetical or conserved hypothetical proteins. in strain 129pt,  <dig> orfs were annotated as encoding hypothetical or conserved hypothetical proteins. among hypothetical proteins that were common to both strains,  <dig> did not have homologs outside the genus. pairwise blast comparisons indicated that strain  <dig> contained  <dig> putative protein coding genes with no homologs in strain 129pt . within this subset, proteins encoded by  <dig> genes had at least  <dig> aa and  <dig> genes  had 38- <dig> aa. strain 129pt contained  <dig> putative protein coding genes with no homologs in strain  <dig> . within this subset, proteins encoded by all  <dig> genes had at least  <dig> aa.

in both strains, a vast majority of putative htgs appeared to have had their origins among members of gammaproteobacteria . putative htgs with possible origins among members of betaproteobacteria  and alphaproteobacteria  were also identified. among htgs identified were those encoding proteins putatively involved in virulence . a complete list of these genes is available at the 'organism details' sections for strains  <dig> and 129pt within img. other strain-specific genes identified encoded dna methylases , transposases , abc transporters , atpases , transcriptional regulators , kinases , and several proteins related to bacteriophage functions . excluding intergenic regions, the total length of sequence that was associated with specific genes in strain  <dig> was  <dig>  bp , and was  <dig>  bp  in specific genes of strain 129pt.

identification of genes encoding polysaccharide biosynthesis/modification enzymes
a search of the ncbi non-redundant protein database using the blastp algorithm identified  <dig> orfs that encode putative glycosyltransferases  in the genomes of strains  <dig> and 129pt. seven of these orfs were common to both genomes ,  <dig> were found only in strain  <dig>  and  <dig> were found only in strain 129pt. among the orfs encoding putative gts common to both strains,  <dig> contained simple sequence repeats , and  <dig> of the  <dig> orfs encoding gts found in strain  <dig> contained ssrs. a list of putative gts and their ssrs identified in both strains are shown in table  <dig>  among the orfs that encode putative gts in h. somni strains, three  had no homologs among other members of the pasteurellaceae and six  had distant homologs  among other members of the pasteurellaceae . these orfs were annotated based on their location on the chromosome , comparative analyses using the swiss-prot database , and their homology to genes encoding putative gts in non-pasteurellaceae genomes .

the lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis  gene cluster consisting of lob <dig> and lob2abcd orfs encoding glycosyltransferases involved in attaching the outer core glycoses of the los was previously identified in strain  <dig>  which is an los phase variant of strain  <dig>  <cit> . strain 129pt encoded full-length homologs of lob <dig> and lob2d, but only the 5' ends of lob2a and lob2c and lacked lob2b  <cit> . strain  <dig> contained full-length homologs of lob <dig> and lob2abc, but a truncated homolog of lob2d . the variations in the lob loci in the genomes of strains  <dig> and 129pt correlate with the differences in the structures of the los of these strains, as determined by nmr spectroscopy and mass spectrometry  <cit> . in addition, both strains contained orfs encoding a phosphoheptose isomerase , d,d-heptose  <dig> -bisphosphate phosphatase , adp-l-glycero-d-mannoheptose-6-epimerase , bifunctional heptose 7-phosphate kinase/heptose 1-phosphate adenyltransferase , and bifunctional n-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate uridyltransferase/glucosamine-1-phosphate acetyltransferase . these five genes/enzymes were predicted to be involved in los core biosynthesis in strains  <dig> and 129pt.

strain  <dig> also contained a locus that encodes proteins putatively involved in exopolysaccharide  and/or los biosynthesis . strain 129pt contained a similar locus  that had an is <dig> element  adjacent to it. furthermore, both strains contained orfs encoding a putative udp-glucose 4-epimerase , phosphoglucomutase , and dtdp-glucose  <dig> -dehydratase . these three genes/enzymes were predicted to be involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis/modification.

acquisition and loss of genes encoding filamentous hemagglutinins
the chromosome of h. somni strain  <dig> contained four loci that have twelve putative genes encoding proteins homologous to fhab, and four putative genes encoding proteins homologous to fhac. locus i of strain  <dig> was  <dig>  bp  and contained genes encoding four fhab homologs  and one fhac homolog . no transposon or phage sequences were present in this locus. in contrast, strain 129pt had a locus containing genes that flanked locus i of strain  <dig>  but did not contain the fhab and fhac homologs . locus ii of strain  <dig> was  <dig>  bp  and contained genes encoding fhab  and fhac , which appeared to be associated with a transposon. strain 129pt had a locus containing genes that flanked locus ii of strain  <dig>  but did not contain the fhab and fhac homologs .

locus iii of strain  <dig> was  <dig>  bp  and contained genes encoding fhab  and fhac . the fhab  of this locus was the second largest gene in the genome and the largest among the  <dig> homologs. this gene encoded a putative protein homologous to the high molecular weight immunoglobulin-binding protein of h. somni and the large supernatant proteins  of h. ducreyi that have been previously described  <cit> . no transposon or phage regions were apparent in this locus. strain 129pt had a locus containing genes that flank locus iii of strain  <dig>  but did not contain the fhab and fhac homologs . locus iv of strain  <dig> was  <dig>  bp  and contained genes encoding six fhab homologs . a truncated gene encoding fhac  was also found in this locus. a partial homolog of  was found in strain 129pt , which appeared to be the only region in the chromosome of strain 129pt with a sequence related to the fhab genes .

the twelve putative fhab homologs found in the four loci of strain  <dig> varied in size, with the smallest and largest being  <dig> aa and  <dig>  aa, respectively. phylogenetic comparison indicated that the four fhab homologs within locus i were most closely related to each other as were the six fhab homologs within locus iv . the fhac homologs of loci i  and iii  were more closely related to each other than to fhac from locus ii . multiple sequence alignment of n-terminal fragments of fhab homologs from the four loci of strain  <dig> with those of bordetella pertussis fha and proteus mirabilis hpma showed that they contain several common features . of the many residues that are shown to be involved in b. pertussis fha secretion,  <dig>  were conserved in all six homologs and  <dig>  were conserved in five of the homologs . however, the npng  and cxxc  motifs that may play a role in stabilization of the helical structure were conserved in only three homologs.

acquisition of a gene encoding subtilisin-like protease
h. somni strain  <dig> gi iii contained a gene encoding a putative subtilisin-like serine protease  10). a blastp search revealed that the non-redundant genbank database contained several proteins that were homologous to , with the closest relative being an e. coli protein . the ncbi protein clusters database lists  as one of the  <dig> members of the  cluster . among the proteins of this cluster, homologs from ralstonia eutropha jmp <dig> , pseudomonas fluorescens pf0- <dig> , and pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448a  are listed in the prokaryotic subtilase database as subtilases of the d-h-s family.

genomic comparison of members of the  cluster revealed that in  <dig> cases , the orf encoding subtilisin was found on plasmids. in the case of delftia acidovorans sph- <dig>  burkholderia ambifaria ammd, polaromonas naphthalenivorans cj <dig>  chelativorans sp. bnc <dig>  and e. coli o127:h <dig> str. e2348/ <dig>  the orf encoding subtilisin was found within a prophage region. furthermore, in the case of photorhabdus luminescens subsp. laumondii tto <dig>  p. syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448a, p. fluorescens pf0- <dig>  verminephrobacter eiseniae ef01- <dig>  and xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae pxo99a, the orf encoding subtilisin appeared to be associated with genes encoding transposases. however, in chromohalobacter salexigens dsm  <dig> and anaeromyxobacter sp. k, the orf encoding subtilisin was not associated with prophage or transposase sequences. interestingly, in  <dig> host species the subtilisin orf formed an operon with an orf encoding homologous atpases of the aaa family. in the case of a. aurescens tc <dig>  a transposon insertion appears to have disrupted the aaa atpase-subtilisin operon. the two orfs have a  <dig> bp overlap in  <dig> species and appear to be co-transcribed . furthermore, comparison of subtilisin sequences from these  <dig> species indicated that motifs containing the catalytic triad  were conserved .

comparison of genes encoding transferrin-binding proteins
a comparison of the genomes of h. somni strains  <dig> and 129pt revealed that both strains contained genes encoding tbpa  and tbpb . in strain 129pt, gi i was identified immediately upstream of the tbp locus. furthermore, homologs of h. somni strain  <dig> tbpa <dig> were present in strain 129pt  and strain  <dig> . pairwise blast analysis identified several other putative genes encoding proteins that may also be involved in iron transport. in strain 129pt these included , iron-regulated outer membrane protein; , tonb-dependent outer membrane receptor; , hemin receptor outer membrane protein; and , iron-regulated outer membrane protein. in strain  <dig> they included , tonb-dependent receptor; , tonb-dependent hemoglobin/transferrin/lactoferrin family receptor; , outer membrane hemin receptor protein, and , tonb-dependent receptor. two of the genes,  and , were strain-specific. among others, hs_ <dig> was associated with a transposase  and  was found near pr iv.

overabundance of genes encoding adhesin-like proteins
strain 129pt contained sixteen genes randomly distributed throughout the chromosome  with homology to genes that encode proteins of the yersinia adhesin  superfamily  <cit> . strain  <dig> also contained sixteen genes randomly distributed throughout the chromosome  with homology to genes that encode proteins of the yada superfamily. adhesin-encoding genes   and   were the largest among all protein coding genes predicted in the chromosomes of strains 129pt and  <dig>  respectively. within this gene repertoire,   and   were 85% similar to each other at the predicted protein level  and were associated with genes encoding putative abc transporters . in addition,   and   were 65% similar to each other at the predicted protein level  and were also associated with genes encoding putative abc transporters . furthermore, although homologs of the h. influenzae fimbrial gene cluster  were absent in both strains of h. somni, homologs of type iv pili genes  occurred in strains  <dig> and 129pt . in addition, both strains contained a gene that encoded a putative pseudopilin  that may facilitate type ii secretion.

identification of genes encoding transcriptional regulators and drug/metal resistance
pairwise blast comparisons indicated that strain  <dig> contained  <dig> genes encoding transcriptional regulators with no homologs in strain 129pt. these included two regulators each that belong to the tetr  and merr  families, one each that belonged to the lysr , ompr , and marr  families, and a member of an unassigned family . among these, members of the tetr, merr, and marr families were found within gi ii. strain  <dig> also contained a gene adjacent to tetr encoding a tetracycline resistance antiporter . the ncbi protein clusters database lists  as a member of the prk <dig> cluster . the closest homologs of  and  were found in p. multocida . in addition to , strain  <dig> also contained  .  is listed as one of the members of the  cluster . this regulator gene was associated with two genes encoding an abc-type transport system . the closest homologs of  were found among members of firmicutes, spirochaetes, and fusobacteria , but not the pasteurellaceae. the two merr homologs of strain  <dig> had only 39% identity to each other  and both were conserved in members of the pasteurellaceae . however, the merr homologs have been included in different protein clusters  and appear to regulate different functions. since  was associated with genes involved in copper metabolism , it may encode a copper efflux regulator, cuer. however,  may be involved in zinc homeostasis since it was associated with zinc-responsive genes . the ncbi protein clusters database lists  as one of the members of the  cluster . the closest homologs of  were found in pasteurella dagmatis , h. influenzae , and several species of streptococci . in strain  <dig>   encoded a putative ompr family response regulator whereas  encoded a putative arca family response regulator. these response regulators have very low homology to each other . however, their amino-termini contained two conserved aspartic acid residues  that may serve as phosphate acceptors and their carboxy-termini contained several conserved residues that may be involved in dna binding . strains  <dig> and 129pt also contained genes that encoded putative histidine kinases . whereas  and  had an orf downstream that encodes a putative cognate response regulator ,  and  had an orf downstream that encodes a transcriptional regulator with an n-terminal xre-type helix-turn-helix domain . strain  <dig> contained an additional gene that encoded a putative histidine kinase  that had a homolog in p. multocida strain pm <dig> , but not in strain 129pt.

identification of genes encoding restriction-modification enzymes
type i and type ii restriction-modification  systems comprise the most frequently encountered dna modifying enzymes among eubacteria. strain  <dig> contained orfs that putatively encode proteins of the type i rm system . although strain 129pt lacked hsdm, it contained a full-length hsdr  and two truncated hsds  orthologs. strain  <dig> also contained an operon putatively encoding enzymes of the type ii rm system . at the predicted protein level, m.hsoi has 68% identity to m.hinp1i  and r.hsoi has 72% identity to r.hinp1i  of h. influenzae p <dig>  strain 129pt lacked m.hsoi and r.hsoi but contained an operon putatively encoding a bcgi-like rm system  that is absent in strain  <dig> 

identification of other genes relevant to metabolism and survival
both h. somni strains contained orfs encoding proteins putatively involved in the transport and metabolism of fucose , mannose , xylose , galactitol , mannitol , and myo-inositol . furthermore, strain  <dig> contained a locus with three orfs encoding proteins putatively involved in galactose utilization , whereas strain 129pt contained only galm  and truncated galk  orthologs. however, both strains have gale, and strain 129pt has galactose in its los , indicating that it can metabolize galactose.

strain 2336-specific genes encoding proteins putatively involved in carbohydrate metabolism included  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  . strain  <dig> also contained orfs encoding a cyclase family protein and a membrane-spanning protein . these orfs appeared to form an operon with orfs encoding proteins putatively involved in butyrate/pyruvate metabolism . furthermore, strain  <dig> contained an orf that encoded an oligopeptide permease abc transporter homolog . the putative opp protein of strain  <dig> was related to oppb proteins involved in peptide transport in e. coli and bacillus subtilis .

genetic events such as deletions, duplications, insertions, and inversions are relatively common in bacterial chromosomes as a result of bacteriophage infection, integration and excision of plasmids, transpositions, and/or replication-mediated translocations  <cit> . in addition, different prophages embedded within a single chromosome can contain similar genes encoding integration and structural functions, and it is not uncommon for these genes to undergo homologous recombination. one of the consequences of such homologous recombination is the rearrangement of the host chromosome  <cit> . these events are known to be the precursors of evolution and can bring about a significant change in the number, linear order, and orientation of genes on the circular chromosomes of different strains/species of closely related bacteria  <cit> .

the presence of prs in the chromosomes of strains  <dig> and 129pt was a notable feature since the number and diversity of genes associated with these prs far exceeded those described in h. influenzae strains rd kw <dig> and 86-028np  <cit> . the difference in the size of the chromosomes of strains  <dig> and 129pt was partly due to prs and associated genes. similar observations have been made in other bacteria wherein prophage-associated sequences constitute a large portion of strain-specific dna  <cit> . although one of the functions of rm systems is to afford protection against bacteriophage attack , it is interesting to note that both strains contain several prophage-like sequences despite the presence of genes encoding putative rm systems in their chromosomes. the lack of orfs encoding hsdm, m.hsoi, and r.hsoi in strain 129pt indicates that these systems are not absolutely essential for cell survival. their absence may also partially explain the relative ease with which this strain can be transformed in the laboratory.

biosynthesis of polysaccharides requires a multitude of gts, which catalyze the transfer of sugars from an activated donor to an acceptor molecule and are usually specific for the glycosidic linkages created  <cit> . intra and interspecies divergence of genes encoding gts are not uncommon. phase-variable los is an important virulence factor of pathogenic strains of h. somni. phase-variation of h. somni los has been shown to be due to the presence of ssrs in genes that encode gts and enzymes involved in assembling non-glycose los components such as phosphorylcholine  <cit> . the genes lob <dig>  lob2ab, and lob2d contain ssrs either just before the start codons or within the open reading frame  <cit> . in addition, , , , and  also contain ssrs that may be responsible for los phase variation, but require additional experimental investigation. most h. somni strains also produce a biofilm-associated eps consisting primarily of mannose and galactose  <cit> . although characterization of some of the genes involved in the biosynthesis and/or modification of h. somni los/eps has been determined, the identification of several more has been facilitated by comparative genome analyses  <cit> . it is likely that some of the observed variations among genes encoding gts in h. somni and other pasteurellaceae members is due to recombination events and/or selective pressure. furthermore, variation in the composition and structure of the loss of strains  <dig> and 129pt may, in part, be due to different gt genes they have acquired or lost. in view of this, the role of new gt genes putatively involved in los biosynthesis and phase variation that have been identified in this study needs to be investigated.

several types of two-partner secretion  pathways have been identified and characterized in gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . filamentous hemagglutinins , consisting of a membrane-anchored protein , which is involved in the activation/secretion of the cognate hemagglutinin/adhesin , are prototypes of two-partner virulence systems. homologs of fhab and fhac that possibly play a role in pathogenesis have been found in several members of the genera bordetella, haemophilus, proteus, and pasteurella,  <cit> . among the  <dig> loci containing fha homologs in strain  <dig>  locus ii appeared to be an acquisition mediated by a transposon and locus i appeared to be an acquisition due to homologous recombination. it appears that strain 129pt has lost an fhab homolog due to bacteriophage excision . it is possible that fhab homologs in locus i of strain  <dig> are paralogs, as are the fhab homologs in locus iv. together, these genes represent a large collection of fhab and fhac homologs in a single genome. the presence of multiple fhab homologs in strain  <dig> may, in part, be responsible for the serum resistance of this strain, in contrast to strain 129pt, which does not contain full length fhab homologs and is serum-sensitive  <cit> . structural and functional studies of n-terminal fragments of fha from b. pertussis and hpma from p. mirabilis have indicated that the proteins form a right-handed parallel Î²-helix  <cit> . several residues that mediate the interaction of b. pertusis fha with its cognate fhac, and facilitate secretion, have also been identified  <cit> . although h. somni fhab homologs have some features in common with fha of b. pertussis and hpma of p. mirabilis, a distinct region is the direct repeat  <dig> fic domain in the fhab homolog in locus iii of strain  <dig> that has been shown to induce cytotoxicity in human hela cells, bovine turbinate cells, and bovine alveolar type  <dig> cells  <cit> . however, the secretion determinants of these proteins and the role of fhac proteins in their secretion remain unknown.

subtilases  are a large superfamily of functionally diverse endo- and exo-peptidases that occur in prokaryotes and eukaryotes  <cit> . bacterial subtilisins may have a role in pathogenesis besides facilitating protein degradation and nutrient acquisition  <cit> . however, subtilisin-like serine proteases from members of the pasteurellaceae have not been characterized previously. the presence of a gene encoding a putative subtilase whose homologs were not found in other members of the pasteurellaceae was yet another example of hgt in strain  <dig>  although h. ducreyi strain 35000hp contains genes  encoding serine proteases that belong to the d-h-s family, they are unrelated to each other and to . in agrobacterium tumefaciens, genes encoding aaa-atpase and subtilisin-like serine protease have been shown to be functionally related and this pair has been proposed to constitute a toxin-antitoxin system that contributes to stability of plasmid ptic <dig>  <cit> . a conjugative megaplasmid-encoded subtilase has been shown to be a virulence factor in e. coli and it has been suggested this toxin activates a v-atpase in vero cells  <cit> . whether the atpase-subtilisin pair identified in this study is transcriptionally and functionally coupled, and whether the protease gene contributes to the pathogenicity of strain  <dig>  has yet to be determined.

the ability to acquire and metabolize iron is an important determinant of bacterial survival and adaptability. in some bacteria, genes that facilitate iron uptake have been shown to be acquired by horizontal transfer  <cit> . several members of the pasteurellaceae possess special outer membrane protein  receptors consisting of two unrelated transferrin-binding proteins, tbpa and tbpb, which facilitate acquisition of transferrin-bound iron from their hosts  <cit> . h. somni strain  <dig> has a tbpa-tbpb receptor system that acquires iron only from bovine transferrin, and a second, probably redundant, tbpa <dig> receptor that can acquire iron from bovine, caprine, or ovine transferrins  <cit> . from genomic analyses, it is apparent that h. somni strains possess multiple genes for the acquisition of iron. horizontal transfer and clustering of genes related to iron metabolism is indicative of enrichment and adaptation of pathogenic h. somni to different niches within its natural host. furthermore, products of one or more of these genes may facilitate binding to transferrins/lactoferrins of different host species and such a gene repertoire could enhance the ability of this bacterium to survive in a variety of ruminants. studies using a mouse model have suggested the role of bovine transferrin and lactoferrin in increasing the virulence of strain  <dig>  <cit> .

many bacterial pathogens contain surface proteins that facilitate adhesion to and/or invasion of the host mucosal barriers  <cit> . some of these proteins may also be involved in bacterial aggregation to form biofilms and their evasion of the host's innate immune system  <cit> . at least three major categories of bacterial adherence proteins have been identified, two of which are hair-like structures called pili and non-pilus-associated proteins called adhesins. the plasmid-encoded yada is a prototype non-pilus-associated protein that has been well characterized  <cit> . mutation or deletion of the yada homolog can reduce virulence in pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . large adhesins in some bacteria are associated with abc transporters and may be involved in biofilm formation  <cit> . a transposon mutagenesis approach has implicated several genes, including those encoding filamentous haemagglutinins, in h. somni biofilm formation  <cit> . h. somni also contains genes putatively involved in adhesin synthesis/transport, pilus formation, and quorum sensing , but their role in facilitating biofilm formation remains to be investigated.

veterinarians use several antibiotics to treat h. somni infections and feedlot cattle enterprises frequently rely on tetracyclines for prophylaxis as well as growth promotion  <cit> . although not common, h. somni resistance to tetracycline has been reported  <cit> . copper and zinc are often included in commercial cattle diets to achieve optimal growth and reproduction. emergence of copper/zinc resistance in bacteria of animal origin has been documented and attributed to the excessive presence of these metals in livestock feed  <cit> . furthermore, the occurrence of genes related to metal and antibiotic resistance on integrative/conjugative elements and their horizontal co-transfer has been noted previously  <cit> . in view of these observations, it was not surprising to find a gi containing genes putatively involved in copper, zinc, and tetracycline resistance in strain  <dig> 

transcriptional regulators play crucial roles in bacterial functions and they have been classified into a number of families  <cit> . the homologs of   in h. influenzae and p. dagmatis are associated with genes encoding proteins involved in fatty acid metabolism . therefore, this cluster may represent a novel class of metabolic regulators within the lysr family. most members of the  cluster are involved in regulation of antibiotic resistance genes  <cit> . homologs of  and  among members of the pasteurellaceae encode tetracycline resistance and are associated with mobile genetic elements  <cit> . homologs of  and  in other bacteria are known to be horizontally transferred and may mediate resistance to antibiotics  <cit> . furthermore, homologs of  and  are predicted to be involved in multidrug resistance  <cit> . in summary, it appears that strain  <dig> contained at least three different systems related to antibiotic resistance. although the functional role of these genes remains to be established, their similarity to metal/antibiotic resistance genes associated with mobile genetic elements in other members of the pasteurellaceae is clinically significant.

from genome comparisons, it appears that there is no correlation between chromosome size and the number of trna genes . whether the lower number of trna genes found in h. somni strains is due to disruptive integration of bacteriophages into trna genes  or is a result of compensatory gene loss in lieu of acquisition of new genes  is unknown. nevertheless, comparison of the chromosomes of strains 129pt and  <dig> bolsters the proposition that prophages and transposons have played a major role in creating genomic diversity and phenotypic variability in the two strains. it is also apparent that strains  <dig> and 129pt have independently and intermittently acquired and lost genes since their divergence from a common ancestor, and that the net gain in strain 129pt is less than the net gain in strain  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
h. somni strain  <dig> contains a larger chromosome when compared to other haemophilus and histophilus strains whose genome sequences are available. several regions that resemble the pathogenicity islands of other virulent bacteria are present in strain  <dig>  there is evidence to suggest that most of these regions were acquired by hgt mechanisms, whereas similar regions were not found in the commensal strain 129pt. although previous studies have discovered the genetic basis for some of the phenotypic dissimilarities between strains  <dig> and 129pt, complete genome sequence analyses have provided a comprehensive account of innate and acquired genetic traits. furthermore, comparisons of the genomes of strains  <dig> and 129pt have contributed to our understanding of the biology and pathogenic evolution of these bacteria. the post-genomic era for h. somni poses new challenges and opportunities in terms of functional characterization of genes and deciphering their roles in colonization, survival, and pathogenesis. continued analyses of the genomes of h. somni strains and comparison with newly sequenced genomes of other bacteria should enhance the current knowledge on virulence mechanisms. nevertheless, the results from this study are expected to facilitate the development of improved diagnostic tests for and vaccines against h. somni.
