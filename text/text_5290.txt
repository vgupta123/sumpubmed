BACKGROUND
wheat is a major food staple providing approximately 20% of the calories and protein consumed by humankind  <cit> . the two major cultivated wheat species are tetraploid durum wheat , which is normally used for pasta-making, and hexaploid bread wheat , which is used for bread and biscuit-making. both of these polyploid species have large genome sizes   <cit> , a high proportion of repetitive elements   <cit> , low gene density, and lack an assembled whole genome sequence. this makes the identification of genes through both forward and reverse genetic approaches a time-consuming and challenging task.

to identify genes in wheat, traditional positional cloning projects are often undertaken, although they are low-throughput and extend for many years. the initial gene discovery phase involves a genome-wide survey and, in the case of quantitative traits, is coupled to a subsequent validation of the most relevant candidate regions using near isogenic lines  <cit> . the ensuing steps towards gene isolation include fine-mapping by increasing marker density across the target region using the syntenic relationships with the sequenced cereal genomes   <cit> . the final steps involve development of physical maps  <cit> , in many cases using dedicated bac libraries  <cit> , and candidate gene validation  <cit> . this strategy has been used successfully to clone several wheat genes with major effects as well as qtl . however, these examples stand out as isolated cases. new approaches are required for step-changes in the speed and effectiveness in which genes are mapped and cloned in polyploid wheat.

next-generation sequencing  technologies are providing new ways to accelerate the genetic analysis of traits. one application of ngs is to use whole genome re-sequencing to aid in the fine-mapping and identification of causal polymorphisms. several strategies have recently been published in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana and have been collectively termed as 'ngs-enabled genetics'  <cit> . the shoremap method  <cit>  uses a single ngs reaction to perform genome-wide re-sequencing of a large bulk of mutant f <dig> individuals that allows the identification of the causative single nucleotide polymorphism  in the gene of interest. austin and co-workers  <cit>  propose a modified version of this approach  which requires much smaller f <dig> populations than shoremap and uses a statistic to qualitatively characterize snp frequencies. another approach, termed 'fast forward genetics', combines bulked segregant techniques with genome capture technology to identify candidate genes  <cit> . these three methods highlight the power of ngs and how different approaches can be combined to accelerate fine-mapping and cloning of genes in a diploid model organism, provided the complete genome sequence and a detailed snp catalogue are available.

the ability to accelerate fine-mapping and cloning of genes in polyploid wheat would have a huge impact on our ability to understand the fundamental biology of this important crop species and would enable wheat breeders to directly access the genetic variation in genes encoding important agronomic traits. the recent development of methods for snp detection in the transcriptome of non-sequenced polyploid species  <cit>  provides an opportunity to use 'ngs-enabled genetics'  <cit>  for this purpose. to address this, we evaluated the use of ngs for both snp discovery and bulked segregant analysis   <cit>  to fine-map a previously cloned gene in polyploid wheat   <cit> . using ngs on mrna samples , we identified over  <dig>  putative snps between parental lines and examined their frequency in the two bulked samples of recombinant lines with contrasting phenotype. we mapped  <dig> new snps across the  <dig> -cm interval  and fine-mapped gpc-b <dig> to approximately  <dig> -cm and within 13- <dig> genes in the syntenic cereal genomes.

RESULTS
assignment of illumina reads to reference wheat unigenes
two near-isogenic lines segregating for the gpc-b <dig> grain protein content locus were selected to identify snps across this chromosomal region. the first line was tetraploid durum wheat langdon , which carries a non-functional allele at gpc-b <dig>  the second line was tetraploid recombinant substitution line  <dig> , which is derived from a cross between ldn and a wild emmer  chromosome 6b substitution line  <cit> . rsl <dig> carries a chromosome 6b segment of wild emmer of at least  <dig> cm that includes a functional gpc-b <dig> allele, but should be isogenic to ldn outside this interval. to reduce variation from growing conditions, parental lines ldn and rsl <dig> were grown together in the same pot. total rna was extracted from leaves at 5th leaf stage and the non-normalized samples were prepared for mrna-seq on the illumina gaiix , one lane per parent). a flow-chart of the complete process is available in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  million paired end  <dig> base reads were obtained for ldn and rsl <dig>  respectively, after excluding low quality reads and trimming for adaptor contamination and low quality regions. there is currently no reference genome sequence available for wheat, therefore individual reads from each parent were aligned to the ncbi wheat transcriptome  <cit> , which comprises  <dig>  unigene sequences, totaling  <dig> , <dig> bases. almost 50% of ldn raw reads  mapped to the reference unigenes with  <dig> % of these mapping in pairs. for rsl <dig>  47% of raw reads  mapped to the ncbi unigene reference, with  <dig> % of them mapping in pairs. taken together, of the total  <dig>  million illumina reads produced,  <dig> % mapped to the ncbi unigene reference.

rna was not normalized in this study as the objectives were both snp discovery and subsequent identification of allele frequencies between bulked samples. to examine the consequences of this approach on the sequencing of highly expressed transcripts, the relative expression level of unigenes was estimated by calculating the transcript abundance expressed as reads per kilobase per million mapped reads   <cit> . unigenes were ranked according to their rpkm  and the accumulated frequency of mapped reads calculated . for the ldn dataset,  <dig> % of all mapped reads correspond to the  <dig> most expressed unigenes  and half of all mapped reads correspond to the  <dig> most highly expressed unigenes. in rsl <dig>  these values are slightly greater with 50% of mapped reads aligning to the  <dig> most highly expressed unigenes. the slope of the curve in figure 1a decreases after the 50% value in both parental lines. this suggests that the lack of normalization results in the extreme over-representation of a few transcripts .

despite this and the incomplete reference used, there was sufficient sequencing depth in a single illumina lane to align reads  to  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes in ldn and rsl <dig>  respectively. this represents approximately 60% of the unigene reference set that was present in the parental data. comparison of unigene transcript levels  between parental lines showed a high correlation  suggesting that the approach followed should be efficient for both snp discovery and the bulked segregant analysis later described.

snp discovery in near-isogenic lines of tetraploid wheat
in polyploids, snp discovery is confounded by the presence of two types of snps. the first corresponds to polymorphisms between homoeologous genomes that occur within homozygous individuals. these snps are commonly found in tetraploid  and hexaploid wheat  as the homoeologous genomes share sequence identities of ~96-98%  <cit> . these snps are referred to as inter-homoeologue polymorphisms   <cit> . the second type of polymorphism corresponds to varietal snps between individuals, representing what is traditionally referred to as allelic variation. this type of snp is much less frequent with modern wheat varieties being ~ <dig> % identical across corresponding orthologous loci. since the transcript assemblies within the reference wheat unigenes represent a consensus sequence derived from the co-assembled a, b and d genomes , the two types of snps cannot be distinguished by simple snp discovery pipelines. therefore, snps were detected and scored based on methods previously developed for the polyploid oilseed rape brassica napus  <cit> .

in this approach, it is expected that reads originating from homoeologous genes  will be mapped to the same unigene reference. maq  <cit>  was used to call snps with respect to the reference for each parental line separately, thus generating two snp sets. this was followed by a second step in which a custom perl script was used to derive the symmetric difference of the two parental snp sets. polymorphisms between homoeologous genomes should generate the same ambiguity code in parental lines and should be common to both snp sets . on the other hand, varietal snps between ldn and rsl <dig> should generate an ambiguity code for only one parent and therefore be unique to that corresponding snp set . such varietal snps at the same locus were termed "hemi-snp" by trick et al.  <cit> . in cases when only one genome is expressed or for single copy genes, snps could be identified as traditional "simple-snps" with each parent represented by a single base.

the implementation of this two-step pipeline identified  <dig>  putative varietal snps across  <dig>  unigenes between ldn and rsl <dig>  the vast majority of the snps discovered  were of the hemi-snp type, manifested as ambiguity codes and signifying co-expression of homoeologous genes, which have a particular nucleotide polymorphism in one parent only. in these circumstances, the hemi-snp then becomes allelic and serves as a genetically tractable marker.

a concern when working with non-sequenced and complex genomes such as those of wheat is the presence of closely related paralogues or pseudogenes that could confound snp discovery and downstream marker design and mapping. evidence of paralogues being mapped to the same reference sequence would be revealed as unigenes with high snp density. therefore, snp densities were calculated for the  <dig>  unigenes with at least one varietal snp and their frequency distribution examined. the average snp density was  <dig>  snps/kb , and decayed rapidly after  <dig> snps/kb. this value is similar to that calculated empirically  by sequencing  <dig>  kb from exons and utrs of four genes across the gpc-b <dig> region  <cit> . based on these results, unigenes with snp densities higher than  <dig> snps/kb were eliminated to avoid possible paralogues yet still allowing space for some variation. roughly 13% of putative snps were discarded, reducing the number to  <dig>  putative snps across  <dig>  unigenes .

snp discovery using modified alignment and snp calling criteria
visual examination of several snps revealed that maq was not able to properly call snps occurring close to homoeologous snps or within a 10-bp sliding window. this meant that some ihps were being called as varietal hemi-snps because of their close proximity. therefore, the default maq parameters were relaxed by setting the maximum summed quality score of mismatched bases to  <dig>  at each step in the workflow . this allowed snp haplotypes occurring within the  <dig> base reads to align with higher mapping quality and reduce these errors.

the maq- <dig> analysis produced some improvements in terms of total reads mapped to the unigene reference , although the percentage of reads that mapped in pairs remained constant . these reads aligned with at least 8-fold coverage to  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes in ldn and rsl <dig>  respectively . a total of  <dig>  putative snps were identified across  <dig>  unigenes , which was a considerable increase compared to the maq default pipeline. again, hemi-snps were most predominant with over 89% of snps being assigned to this type. after filtering for unigenes with >  <dig> snps/kb, roughly one quarter of putative snps were discarded . the final outputs of the maq- <dig> analysis were  <dig>  putative snps across  <dig>  unigenes .

identification of putative linked snps via bulked segregant analysis
twenty eight homozygous lines with recombination events across a ~12-cm interval   <cit>  were used to assemble bulks for contrasting phenotype . the lines were first characterized for three markers spanning the 250-kb region adjacent to gpc-b <dig> to confirm their genotype. all lines produced the expected results, except rsl <dig>  which was heterozygous for all markers and was therefore excluded from downstream work. equal amounts of total rna from the  <dig> individuals previously classified as having high protein content were mixed to produce the high protein rna bulk, whereas  <dig> recombinant lines were used for the low protein bulk . for each bulk, two libraries with slightly different average insert size  were constructed and sequenced in individual illumina lanes .

the quality control assessment of reads was similar to the parental lines. for both the maq-default and the maq- <dig> analysis, a higher percentage of reads mapping to the reference set was obtained in the 400-bp libraries compared to the 250-bp libraries , although a smaller number of reads aligned in pairs . combining both libraries, a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  million paired end reads were produced for the high and low bulk, respectively. again, the maq- <dig> analysis was more successful in aligning a higher percentage of reads to the reference  compared to the maq-default analysis . these values are similar to those obtained in the parental lines when comparing only the equivalent 400-bp libraries.

 <dig> = *100

the objective of sequencing rna from bulked samples was to compare the allelic frequencies for the parental snps between the two bulks. in a diploid organism, a snp coinciding with the gene underlying the trait of interest should be revealed by informative base frequencies tending to either  <dig>  or to  <dig>  in the two bulks, depending on the parental origin. however, in polyploid species this upper limit of  <dig>  is lower. for example, for a hemi-snp identified in ldn  with respect to rls <dig> , the signal from the informative base  is partially masked by the homoeologous  base  . therefore, the upper limit frequency of the informative base would tend to  <dig>  in tetraploid species, assuming quantitative co-expression of the two homoeologous transcripts. this value would change when relative transcript levels depart from parity. for each bulk, the frequency of the informative base was calculated at each snp position and then the ratio between the bulks was determined for each snp. this ratio between bulks was termed bulk frequency ratio . for hemi-snps with an informative base derived from ldn, the bfrs were determined by dividing the frequency in the low bulk by the frequency in the high bulk. for hemi-snps derived from rsl <dig>  these values were reversed. thus, the bfr provides a relative measure of the enrichment of the corresponding parental allele in the appropriate bulk .

the approach focused exclusively on the putative snps previously identified between ldn and rsl <dig> in the initial experiment and did not seek to identify snps in the complex bulk rna mixtures. of the  <dig>  snps  identified in the maq-default analysis,  <dig>  snps were recovered and had sequence coverage of at least 8-fold in both bulks . in this analysis, only one snp per unigene was used to estimate the bfr. therefore, the percentage of snps recovered was only  <dig> %, even though this represents  <dig> % of the unigenes. the highest bfr identified was the simple snp t115g in unigene ta#s <dig>  which had a  <dig> -fold enrichment. the ldn allele was present in only  <dig> % of the high bulk sequences, whereas  <dig> % of the low bulk reads carried this allele. these values are consistent with the expected frequencies of a tightly linked simple snp. this unigene was homologous to brachypodium bradi3g <dig>  rice loc_os02g <dig>  and sorghum sb04g <dig>  which are all in the corresponding collinear regions to wheat chromosome arm 6bs, where gpc-b <dig> maps.

allele frequencies of the maq- <dig> putative snps  were also examined in the bulks. in this new pipeline, the frequencies and ratios of multiple snps within a single unigene were estimated independently and thus all snps were considered. over 71% of snps  had at least 8-fold coverage and could be detected in both bulks . again, the putative snp with the highest bfr was t115g in unigene ta#s <dig>  although the exact values changed slightly with the maq- <dig> pipeline . the putative snp with the second highest bfr was a rsl <dig> hemi-snp g582r in ta#s <dig>  the informative base  was present in only  <dig> % of the low bulk reads, whereas it was found in  <dig> % of the reads from the high bulk . these values are consistent with the expectations of a tightly linked hemi-snp. again, this unigene has homology to cereal genes that map within the syntenic regions to wheat chromosome arm 6bs .

snp validation
the distribution of the bfrs across both analyses was used to determine which putative snps to validate and map . approximately 85% of snps had a bfr lower than  <dig> , suggesting that both ldn and rsl <dig> alleles were expressed at relatively similar levels in both bulks. as the bfr threshold increased, the number of snps decreased in comparative terms in both analyses. the objective was to use a threshold that was sufficiently low to examine the sensitivity of this approach, while maintaining the number of snps to be validated within a manageable number. therefore, a bfr of ≥  <dig>  was empirically determined as the threshold resulting in a total of  <dig> snps  across  <dig> unigenes.

to validate these putative polymorphisms, a single snp for each unigene was selected for marker development. the  <dig> putative snps from the maq-default analysis  were first examined. fifteen snps were either located too close to the ends of the available sequence or their assigned unigenes were repetitive as determined by high number of hits to the 5× chinese spring wheat genomic sequence   <cit> . therefore, these  <dig> snps were removed from further analysis. a total of  <dig> assays were developed of which  <dig> gave successful amplification in ldn and rsl <dig>  pcr amplicons were visualized through single strand conformation polymorphism  and the target polymorphism was detected in  <dig> unigenes , whereas  <dig> assays  were monomorphic. the absence of the putative snps in the monomorphic amplicons was confirmed by direct sequencing of pcr products .

the subsequent maq- <dig> analysis yielded a total of  <dig> putative snps with bfrs above  <dig> , and  <dig> snps  were in common with the maq-default analysis. examination of these common putative snps showed that of the  <dig> successful assays previously developed,  <dig> were polymorphic between ldn and rsl <dig> , whereas only nine were monomorphic. this was a large increase with respect to the average polymorphic rate in the initial maq-default analysis  .

to assess if the increase in validation rate was consistent across all the maq- <dig> putative snps, snp assays were developed for an additional  <dig> putative snps that were only identified in the maq- <dig> analysis. the maq- <dig> unique snps had a lower validation rate  to those of the common snps, comparable to the validation rate of the maq-default unique snps . in total,  <dig> putative snps were successfully screened from the maq- <dig> analysis  with  <dig> snps being validated as polymorphic  and  <dig> confirmed monomorphic. these results suggest that the maq- <dig> analysis is able to identify putative snps with a similar conversion rate  to that of the maq-default analysis , but that the snps common between both analyses produces the putative snp set with the highest validation percentage .

in summary,  <dig> snps  from a total of  <dig> putative snps were confirmed  as polymorphic in the parental lines.

mapping of validated snps
the  <dig> validated snps were screened in the individual rsls that comprised the high and low protein bulks. the snps from the maq-default analysis were screened by sscp  and direct sequencing of pcr products , whereas the confirmed snps from the maq- <dig> analysis  were screened using kaspar assays . all confirmed snps could be scored in the  <dig> rsls and parental lines, except for one snp , which was very difficult to score unequivocally by sscp and was therefore removed from further analysis.

a total of  <dig> snps mapped to the  <dig>  cm region encompassing gpc-b <dig>  defined by xwms508-xwms <dig> . this translates to roughly 63% of validated snps mapping to the target region as determined by the rsls. twenty-four snps could not be mapped immediately linked to this region, although  <dig> snps were linked amongst them. of the  <dig> linked snps, one mapped just distal to xwms <dig>  whereas  <dig> snps mapped within the  <dig>  cm target interval . this equates to an average marker density of one snp marker per  <dig>  cm across this region, with values ranging from one snp marker per  <dig>  cm in the distal end of the map , to one snp marker every  <dig>  cm in the proximal end . almost all recombination events across the region were identified, including additional ones that were previously not resolved. the recombination events not identified correspond to those just flanking the gpc-b <dig> gene on either side, between xucw <dig> and xucw <dig>  the composition of the  <dig> snps was similar to that of the overall maq-default and maq- <dig> analysis, with a higher number of hemi-snps  than simple snps , and a similar proportion coming from each parent . the snp marker details are provided in additional file  <dig> 

unique orthologues could be determined for  <dig> of the  <dig> wheat unigenes in the sequenced brachypodium and rice genomes, whereas  <dig> unigenes had unique orthologues in sorghum. based on the established syntenic relationships,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of these orthologues were located on the corresponding syntenic regions in brachypodium, rice and sorghum, respectively. this implies that between 56%  and 69%  of the mapped unigenes are syntenic. these collinear regions encompass between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb and include  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes in brachypodium, rice and sorghum, respectively. the distribution of the orthologous syntenic cereal genes was examined to estimate the number of genes between each snp in the sequenced genomes. on average, the orthologous syntenic genes were separated by  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes in brachypodium, rice and sorghum, respectively. this average includes markers on adjacent genes to markers separated by at most  <dig> genes in brachypodium and sorghum and  <dig> genes in rice. the remaining unigenes have orthologues that map elsewhere in these sequenced grass genomes and there is no apparent pattern except for two unigenes, which are linked in wheat and map closely in brachypodium , rice  and sorghum .

the gpc-b <dig> gene was mapped using the phenotypic information previously published for the rsls  <cit>  within a  <dig>  cm interval defined by flanking loci ta#s <dig> and ta#s <dig> . these markers were either completely linked or just one recombination away from the snps with the highest bfrs from the maq-default and maq- <dig> analyses . the homology of these markers to brachypodium, rice and sorghum provides an immediate location for gpc-b <dig> within a region including approximately  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively. table  <dig> shows the characteristics of these markers with their syntenic relationship. these results, together with the distribution of snp markers across the wheat gpc-b <dig> genetic map, suggest that the enrichment via bsa was very effective at identifying closely spaced markers, enabling the mapping of the gene to a narrow genetic interval.

 <dig> h = hemi-snp, s = simple snp

 <dig> snp present in maq- <dig> analysis using 12× and 16× coverage

 <dig> rpkm: reads per kilobase per million mapped reads

to further refine this position, we examined the parental snp data to identify cases where a collinear cereal gene did not have a corresponding wheat unigene, or to assess if any parental snps in candidate genes were not identified in the bulks. we analyzed  <dig> wheat unigenes with homology to genes within the intervals defined in brachypodium, rice and sorghum, but only one had a snp between ldn and rsl <dig>  and was confirmed to be monomorphic. we next developed an additional nine gene models in wheat for genes that had no corresponding unigene in the reference set used to map the illumina reads. again, this search was unsuccessful, as no additional parental snps were found based on our mapping criteria. regardless of these specific results, the ability to examine the data in an iterative manner should be useful for other gene targets.

effects of coverage on snp calling and enrichment in bulks
increasing the depth threshold applied to the whole snp calling process serves to increase the probability that reads from each homoeologue are sampled. we therefore examined the effect of different minimum depth thresholds  on the false positive rate of snps identified under the maq- <dig> analysis. first, the total number of snps with a bfr above  <dig>  decreased from  <dig> using 8-fold coverage, to  <dig>  and  <dig> putative snps using 16-fold coverage. the subset of  <dig> snps from the maq- <dig> analysis, which was experimentally tested, was further examined . with 8-fold coverage,  <dig> % of predicted snps  were validated in the parental lines and could be mapped in the recombinants. this value increased considerably with 12-fold and 16-fold coverage, where 66%  and 83%  of the putative snps were confirmed to be polymorphic. a similar number of the total putative snps was assayed  under the three coverage scenarios, suggesting that the comparisons are meaningful. in all three cases, 67-72% of the polymorphic snps mapped to the gpc-b <dig> target interval. in summary, increasing coverage from 8-fold to 16-fold reduces the total number of putative snps identified in the bulks by 60%, increases the validation rate from 57%-83%, but does not affect the percentage of validated snps mapping to the target interval .

discussion
the use of ngs-enabled forward genetics is revolutionizing the speed and ability to fine-map and clone genes in model diploid organisms  <cit> . to understand how these approaches could be implemented in a polyploid, non-sequenced species such as wheat, we examined the use of ngs on mrna transcripts for snp discovery and combined this with bsa to identify snps that were closely linked to the causal gene.

ngs-enabled genetics in wheat
our strategy consisted of using near isogenic lines  to focus the snp discovery on a specific chromosome interval. we hypothesized that the majority of snps would map to the ~ <dig> cm interval on chromosome 6b  that was segregating between these lines. the direct analysis of our results in wheat was not possible due to the absence of an assembled wheat genome sequence. therefore, we conducted this analysis using the most closely related sequenced cereal, brachypodium distachyon  <cit> , acknowledging the fact that only 60-70% of genes have a real syntenic relationship  <cit> .

three brachypodium regions were identified as being over-represented  including two distinct and separate regions of chromosome  <dig>  this was expected, based on the well established syntenic relationship between triticeae group  <dig> chromosomes and brachypodium chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the synteny stretches across the short arm of triticeae group  <dig> and brachypodium  and continues in the long arm of wheat  <dig> and the brachypodium interval starting at approximately  <dig>  mb  and finishing at the end of the chromosome   <cit> . the short arm syntenic region was enriched across the complete interval, whereas the long arm interval was enriched only in the proximal section. this most likely reflects the fact that rsl <dig> is not a complete chromosome substitution line and is known to carry a ldn segment in the distal end of chromosome arm 6bl  <cit> .

we also identified a region of brachypodium chromosome  <dig>  that was unexpectedly enriched for snps as its overall syntenic relationship is to wheat chromosome arm  <dig> l  <cit> . only one of the  <dig> snps identified in this interval  was mapped to the 6bs region and in total only two snps  were enriched in the bulks . this stands in contrast to the snps mapping to brachypodium chromosome  <dig>  where  <dig> snps were identified and over 13%  were enriched in the bulks. this suggests either the presence of an additional wild emmer chromosome fragment in rsl <dig>  which was previously not identified by molecular markers, or a small insertion of genes into wheat 6b. overall, the approach was successful at identifying snps in the corresponding collinear regions, despite a variable level of background noise across all brachypodium chromosomes. when analyzing the 12-fold and 16-fold coverage data, the background noise decreased, while the three previously identified regions remained consistently above background level .

we sampled healthy vegetative stage leaves, whose transcriptome should be well represented in the est collections, yet we were only successful in mapping, at most, 57% of the illumina reads to the ncbi unigene reference. this was despite testing several different parameters in maq, using different library insert sizes, and different thresholds for trimming of reads. in part this is surprising as the unigene build includes over one million wheat ests from different accessions and developmental stages, although the recent sequencing and analysis of wheat chromosome group  <dig> genes suggests that less than 65% of them are represented in the est collections  <cit> . the maq-default results are consistent with recent studies in brassica  <cit> , which also used a unigene set drawn from  <dig>  ests as a reference, but with  <dig> base reads. we further examined our reads by remapping those that were initially unmapped to the ncbi unigenes against a 5× assembly of  <dig> 'chinese spring' wheat genomic sequences . we found that 57% of the unmapped ldn reads and 65% of the unmapped rsl <dig> reads aligned to this new reference, implying that at least 80-85% of the illumina reads are in fact expressed wheat sequences. these results also agree with recent  <dig> rnaseq data from flag leaves  <dig> days after anthesis  <cit> . in this study,  <dig>  novel transcripts were assembled that had no sequence similarity  to any ncbi wheat est. these results highlight the incomplete nature of the current ncbi reference wheat unigene set.

a consequence of this sampling strategy was that we eliminated the possibility of identifying the causal gpc-b <dig> snp. this gene is expressed only after anthesis  <cit>  and was not detected in the vegetative tissue used for the rnaseq experiments. this was done consciously as our objective was to test the performance of the approach using the information that was available during the original cloning project. the senescence associated expression pattern was only uncovered during the final stages of the positional cloning  <cit> , therefore sampling was done in the most unbiased way possible. we also considered the under-representation of senescence associated transcripts in the ncbi unigene reference that was recently confirmed in parallel work  <cit>  and, which we predicted, would have resulted in even fewer mapped reads and an overall decrease in the power of the examined approach.

a key feature in any attempt to perform ngs-enabled genetics in wheat is the necessity to reduce the complexity of the sample. straightforward genomic dna sequencing is not economically feasible for individual groups due to the large genome size of tetraploid  and hexaploid  wheat even with the current sequencing capabilities. therefore, alternative approaches must be used. genome capture  <cit>  is currently being pursued by several groups working on polyploid wheat  <cit> , although this approach is inherently limited to the genes that are defined on the capture array. as discussed above, the current wheat unigene set is probably not complete enough for the precision that is needed in mapping projects. an alternative method is rnaseq  <cit> , representing an open platform that can detect novel transcripts as long as they are expressed to levels compatible with the achieved sequencing depth.

in this study, we used rnaseq as the strategy for complexity reduction in tetraploid wheat. this method has been successfully implemented for snp discovery in several species and focuses on just a fraction of the complete genome. for example, the ncbi reference has a gene space of  <dig> , <dig> bp per genome equivalent, accounting for less than 1% of the complete tetraploid genome. we also consciously used non-normalized rna samples as the downstream bsa requires quantitative estimates of frequency ratios, which would be perturbed by a normalization procedure. however, this generates a major drawback as 50% of all mapped reads correspond to just a minute fraction of very highly expressed unigenes . after accounting for these 'lost' reads and those not mapping to the ncbi reference, less than 30% of all raw reads generated  were used for the vast majority of the snp discovery and bsa analysis. this though still provides an average coverage of 23-fold per genome for each unigene.

the use of rnaseq for genome reduction can also generate discrepancies between snp calling in rna samples and snp validation in genomic dna . expression differences between homoeologous genomes led to snps being identified in the rnaseq data, but these putative snps were not identified subsequently in the dna samples. this confounded our results and was further accentuated by the low coverage used in the snp detection . in addition, the more variable nature of rna expression data compared to gdna meant that bfr values were not perfectly correlated with their map position across gpc-b <dig> . despite these apparent inefficiencies, our results suggest that non-normalized rnaseq was a successful strategy for both snp discovery and bsa analysis in tetraploid wheat.

snp discovery and validation
the initial mapping of reads was conducted with the maq default parameter of  <dig> for maximum summed quality scores of mismatched bases. in polyploid species, a high quality mismatch is given not only by varietal snps, but also by the homoeologous snps between genomes. since homoeologous wheat transcripts are approximately 97% identical  <cit> , we relaxed the mapping criteria to a value of  <dig> to allow for  <dig> high quality ihps across the reads plus an additional varietal snp . this better reflects the biology and the fact that the unigene reference is based on wheat ests, which represent all three homoeologues and have been collapsed into a single consensus sequence.

as expected, the maq- <dig> parameters increased the percentage of mapped reads for all samples and outperformed maq-default by identifying 29% more putative snps across 22% more unigenes. the validation rate of putative snps was very similar between methods . the maq- <dig> analysis provided the ability to detect varietal snps close to ihps  that were missed originally when using the maq-default parameters. however, by relaxing the overall mapping parameters, several confirmed varietal snps from the maq-default analysis were discarded because the corresponding unigenes had snp densities above  <dig> snps/kb. this highlights the difficulties in finding the right balance in the mapping parameters and exemplifies potential drawbacks of each approach.

the ability to detect rare transcripts is an important aspect of the snp discovery and bsa strategy, especially in polyploid species with hemi-snps. the lander-waterman model  <cit>  provides an initial estimation of 8-fold coverage to randomly sample a read with  <dig> % probability, but this does not account for the tetraploid nature of the sequences examined in this study and assumes that reads will be randomly sampled. wendl and wilson  <cit>  address the issue of coverage in heterozygous samples from diploid organisms, which serves as an approximation to our study. based on their calculations, the probability that at least two independent reads of both parental alleles will be sampled with 16-fold coverage is  <dig> %, whereas with only 8-fold coverage this probability drops to  <dig> % . the fact that we analyzed expressed sequences adds an extra layer of variation, although the high correlation in expression of parental alleles  suggests a relative balance between the lines.

our results confirmed that the 8-fold coverage was not sufficient to account for sampling variation within the bulk samples. the composition of the examined maq- <dig> snps suggests that hemi-snps had a lower validation rate than simple snps at 8-fold coverage. this is expected from the discussion above, as simple snps can be considered as single copy genes that would follow the lander-waterman model more closely. the majority of the putative hemi-snps, which were later confirmed to be monomorphic, appeared to be represented by only one homoeologous transcript in the bulk alignment, as determined by the absence of linked ihps within the read. with increased coverage, the percentage of validated hemi-snps increased from 52%-83%, whereas simple snps increased marginally from 75%-83% . a similar analysis on the maq- <dig> unique snps revealed that validation rates increased to 78% when considering those snps identified with at least 16-fold coverage . a detailed breakdown of snps lost during each step, and a summary of the possible reasons, is provided in additional file 1: table s <dig>  taken together, these results suggest that a minimum coverage of 8-fold per diploid genome is an effective way to increase the validation rate by simply decreasing the sampling error.

snp validation was greatly facilitated by the development of novel genotyping technologies that are flexible and allow a rapid assay design at a relatively low cost. we initially validated snps using the sscp method, as it allows the resolution of polymorphisms in co-amplified homoeologues from a pcr reaction. this circumvents the design of homoeologue specific assays, which are normally required for most genotyping platforms. although this method proved reliable, it has limitations in that the putative snp is not directly assayed and that it is an overnight gel-based system that is not high-throughput . therefore, for the maq- <dig> putative snps we used the kaspar platform, which is a pcr based system that only requires a three minute end-point fluorescence analysis and which has a higher throughput than sscp. kaspar allows the direct assay of the putative snp as the two alternative bases are positioned in the 3' end of the two competing pcr primers . both methods require a preliminary annotation of the sequence as intron positions, which are anonymous in the rnaseq data, must be considered; but this is now a minor step with the publicly available 5× chinese spring wheat genome. importantly, kaspar has proven to be extremely flexible and robust in polyploid wheat and is quickly becoming an important marker system in wheat research  <cit>  and breeding programmes .

bsa and mapping
the resolution of the bsa is given by the marker density and by the combined recombinations within each bulk. in wheat, marker densities are variable and depend on the relatedness of the parental lines, marker systems employed, number of individuals examined, and the genome being studied . regardless of these factors, most genetic maps in wheat have at best an average mapping resolution of 5- <dig> cm. this includes maps between durum and emmer wheat using a combination of ssr and dart markers , as well as the recently published map of two uk elite lines that includes ssr, dart and over  <dig> kaspar markers . these relatively low marker densities, compared to sequenced genomes, limit the mapping resolution of bsa. we believe that this has now changed with the advent of ngs approaches, which allow an unprecedented number of snps to be identified and evaluated in polyploid wheat. this suggests that the resolution of bsa in wheat will be dependent on the approach used for complexity reduction  and the recombinations within each sequenced bulk.

the first ngs studies in arabidopsis re-sequenced dna from large bulks of ~ <dig> f <dig> individuals to map specific ems mutations  <cit> . recent approaches have shown consistent results with  <dig> f <dig> individuals by exploiting a larger number of snps  <cit> . both approaches take advantage of the physical map and known gene content in arabidopsis, focus on specific ems-induced transitions that lead to amino acid changes in proteins, and benefit from the low mutation densities in arabidopsis   <cit> . this means that in arabidopsis, mapping a mutation to within 300- <dig> kb should suffice as the number of candidate snps corresponding to ems mutations and leading to amino acid changes should be very small. in maize, several recessive mutant phenotypes have been mapped using a bsa and quantitative genotyping  approach  <cit> . in this study, a genome wide scan was conducted using bulks of at least  <dig> f <dig> individuals, and mapping intervals of several cm were achieved.

in our study, we used bulks composed of a seemingly small number of individuals;  <dig> and  <dig> homozygous f <dig> recombinant lines per bulk. these lines originate from a large screen of ~ <dig>  f <dig> plants and were selected based on the presence of recombination across a  <dig>  cm interval to which gpc-b <dig> was previously mapped. therefore, although the absolute number of individuals is low with respect to other studies, the amount of information in terms of recombination is high. considering equal probability of recombination for all  <dig> individuals across the  <dig>  cm interval, we expected to achieve a mapping resolution of  <dig>  cm.

in wheat, a bespoke physical map is required for each positional cloning project making the ability to rapidly achieve sub-cm intervals critical for success. based on previous experience, one bac clone is roughly equivalent to  <dig>  cm, therefore small genetic distances  are usually required before initiating the physical map to reduce the number of chromosome walking steps. using a traditional mapping approach with individual marker development based on collinearity, we had previously mapped gpc-b <dig> to a  <dig>  cm interval defined by rice genes os02g <dig> and os02g <dig>   <cit> . in this study, we mapped gpc-b <dig> to a genetic interval of  <dig>  cm defined by os02g <dig> and os02g <dig>  although we did not achieve single-bac resolution, this compares favourably considering that the proximal flanking marker ta#s <dig> shares homology to os02g <dig>  only one gene away from the end of the physical map  developed for the cloning of gpc-b <dig>  and the distal flanking marker ta#s <dig> is homologous to os02g <dig>  just five genes away in rice to the distal end of the physical map, os02g <dig> 

this very narrow mapping interval was achieved in a matter of months as opposed to years, although it is important to consider that we benefitted from high quality phenotypic data and germplasm to assemble the bulks. the new genotyping and sequencing technologies will reduce the time and effort required for many steps such as screening for recombinant plants, identifying polymorphic markers, and genotyping the individuals from the bulks. however, the reliable phenotyping of plants will remain a major determinant in the successful outcome of any bsa and mapping project. having said this, these new technologies now allow for several genes to be targeted in parallel by a single person and for bsa to be conducted in species with no genome sequence information.

future directions
our results suggest that ngs-enabled genetics should be feasible in polyploid species and highlight several areas for further improvement in wheat genomics. an important first step would be to produce a more comprehensive and definitive unigene set for wheat. there are several ongoing efforts which should be coordinated to develop a publicly available gene set for all wheat researchers. we expect a catalogue of ihps to be available for the three wheat genomes and an initial assignment of snps should be possible based on the diploid progenitors. this strategy has been used successfully before  <cit>  and the publicly available ae. tauschii raw sequences  <cit>  are a good starting point for the d genome. the combination of a comprehensive gene set with ihps will make the varietal snp detection pipeline much more efficient by initially masking for ihps and then using these to assign genomes. by linking ihps to varietal snps, it should be possible to automate the design of homoeologue specific primers. flexible platforms for snp detection, such as kaspar, will make this approach even more robust and accessible to a large number of research groups. an important final element is the release of sequences for the individual wheat chromosome arms. currently, sequences are publicly available for group  <dig>  <cit>  and group  <dig>  <cit>  chromosomes and the remaining sequences are currently being generated  <cit> . combining the information outlined above would result in a comprehensive set of unigenes, with haplotype information for each genome, and mapped to the corresponding chromosome arms. this would represent a step-change in wheat genomics and would significantly enhance the ngs-bsa approach.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we outline a method that combines snp discovery by rnaseq with bsa for fine-mapping genes in polyploid wheat. a balanced set of validated snps from both parents was generated and ~70% mapped within the targeted interval. the snps were well distributed and allowed the identification of almost all recombination events, successfully mapping a gene  to a  <dig>  cm interval. the large number of snps also generated a high density haplotype across the region, which in future projects will be useful for breeding purposes.
