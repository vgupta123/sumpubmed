BACKGROUND
one of the most ambitious objectives of natural variation studies is to provide a description of functional variability in natural populations  <cit> . the ability of a living organism to endure environmental challenges depends on the portion of genetic variation with adaptive implications  <cit>  that sustains the formation of ecotypes through ecological evolution  <cit> . in plant sciences, being able to identify the genetic determinants of complex traits may help enhance crops  <cit> . the discovery of the genetic bases of complex traits with adaptive significance in model species  <cit>  and in crops  <cit>  is often the first step towards molecular breeding programs  <cit> .

domestication and breeding, however, have caused a severe reduction of crop diversity, whose extant genetic variation is much smaller than that of their wild relatives  <cit> . this limits the diversity in which to search for adaptation, thus hindering our ability to identify favourable allelic combinations. focusing on natural populations of the wild relatives of crops, with their broader genetic diversity, could help overcome this limitation and even allow new ground to be broken. as geographical objects, natural populations might be used to study the relation between the genetic and ecologic diversity in search of adaptive traits. genomic synteny would then allow the targeting of homologous candidate adaptive genes in the crop of interest  <cit> . the environment can be considered as an unceasing breeder selecting for successful alleles, providing this approach potential downfalls in an agronomic perspective.

the relation between genetic and climatic variation in natural populations has already been explored in humans  <cit> , and genetic determinants for fitness variation in different environments have been described in arabidopsis thaliana
 <cit> . environmental data was gradually introduced in population genetics practises, being addressed by some landscape genetics and landscape genomics  <cit> , thereby being able to describe adaptive variability by means of the differential distribution of alleles on an ecological basis  <cit> . this can be done either through i) outlier detection or ii) association methods  <cit> . outlier detection relies on wright’s fixation index fst
 <cit>  to identify loci under selection through their differentiation from the basal and neutral genomic variation  <cit> . although widely used in animal species  <cit>  and less frequently in plant species  <cit> , outlier detection can be biased by genetic structure and limited sensitivity  <cit> . in addition, it does not explicitly address environmental variation. on the other hand, association methods are based on marker - trait regressions and they directly target quantitative measures of the environment. the statistical framework of association methods is largely similar to that of genome-wide association studies , which were originally developed in humans  <cit>  to map complex trait determinants. gwas are increasingly applied to plants  <cit> , where generally higher minor allele frequencies, multi-trait directional selection, and extensive linkage disequilibrium simplify their application  <cit> .

when considering organisms with limited displacing abilities such as plants, association methods might accommodate quantitative environmental data as a response variable rather than phenotypes, and map genomic associations with climate . whilst outlier loci methods perform better with the strongest signatures of selection, association methods are appropriate to ascertain weak selection  <cit> , and may lead to the identification of soft sweep signatures of low intensity selection  <cit> . outlier detection and association methods were merged in an investigation into populus
 <cit>  and teosinte
 <cit> , thus leading to the identification of loci with clear adaptive significance towards climate. a study in medicago joined the association approach with an ex situ phenotypic evaluation, confirming the reliability of these methods  <cit> . in all cases, great focus is needed on to the interrelation of genetic variation and spatial displacement, as false statistical signals might arise when spatial structuration mirrors environmental adaptation  <cit> . the dependency of genetic diversity upon spatial diversity, though rarely considered in depth, can heavily influence the outcome of both these methods.

merging population genomics and landscape data requires two sources of information. the landscape derives from geographical information systems , which can be used to couple quantitative geographical data with biological sampling  <cit>  and model the spatial relations of individuals. global climate models developed for giss  <cit>  link climatic information with sampled individuals, providing both quantitative environmental data for each individual studied and a means for controlling spatial bias over genetic diversity. the genomics, in fact, must first consider the disturbance caused by the many evolutionary forces other than selection  <cit> , as well as disturbance due to unknown demography that might add noise to association approaches  <cit> . high-throughput genotyping data are needed in order to provide the widest possible representation of the variation at a genome level, and thus efficiently control the many forces acting at such scale. the lowering of dna sequencing costs together with the application of strategies for the reduction of genome complexity  <cit>  makes dna sequencing itself a means for discovering and analysing molecular markers  <cit> . genotyping-by-sequencing   <cit>  is a reductionist strategy, and is increasingly employed in ecological genomics studies  <cit> .

in this paper, we identify loci linked to environmental adaptation in turkish accessions of the grass species brachypodium distachyon  p. beauv. brachypodium distachyon is the leading model species for small grain monocots and temperate grasses  <cit> , with an ancestral range spanning the middle and near east, and currently including most of the temperate areas of the world  <cit> . until recently, b. distachyon was deemed to have three distinct cytotypes of 2n =  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> chromosomes: a recent study identified three different taxonomic entities, of which b. distachyon has the 2n =  <dig> chromosome set  <cit> . b. distachyon genome  was completely sequenced in the inbred line bd <dig>  <cit> . natural populations of b. distachyon have already been extensively collected in turkey, showing high intra-population homozygosity and a high level of inter-population genetic diversity  <cit> . this was an interesting condition to test the possibility to search for environmental adaptation whilst accounting for structuration.

we explored the possibility of identifying the relation between climate and genomic features in a starting panel of  <dig> b. distachyon individuals collected in nine locations scattered across a 1000-km transect in turkey. by this, we wanted to exploit both methods developed in the landscape genomics field and in the gwas community. bringing landscape genomics closer to complex traits mapping, especially in an agronomical perspective, might open a significant perspective in the field. we employed a gbs approach to provide a genome-wide representation of molecular diversity in these b. distachyon individuals. the sampling locations were monitored on a gis system to obtain climatic data for each individual, at the same time controlling for the spatial distribution of genetic diversity. the data was processed using the complementary characteristics of outlier and association approaches in order to identify signatures of adaptation at a molecular level.

we found that the association and outlier methods mostly targeted soft and hard sweeps of selection, respectively. gwas and landscape genomics method jointly identified  <dig> genes involved in b. distachyon adaptation. we also found that transposable elements were differentially distributed across the genomes of local groups, some with a pattern matching the climatic diversity of the sampling transect.

our method could be extended by including more genotypes and by targeting additional environments and environmental variables. once the biological material is characterized, this might aggregate additional data and thus extend our capacity to understand the molecular bases of adaptation. b. distachyon could then be used as a natural probe to report functional variations in a broad set of environmental situations.

RESULTS
gis analyses and sampling
nine turkish brachypodium distachyon local groups  were sampled in separate locations in order to maximize environmental diversity. the map resulting from the ecocrop modelling in diva-gis  highlights the heterogeneous grid cells chosen for sampling. geographical coordinates relative to the sampling locations were used to derive environmental data such as  <dig> bioclim variables and altitude. after normalization, environmental data was reduced by principal component analysis . the first three pcs accounted for  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total variance. pc <dig> was positively correlated with altitude, temperature ranges, and negatively with rainfall. it represents the environmental gradient moving from western wet lowlands in turkey to eastern dry uplands. pc <dig> was positively correlated with temperatures and weakly with altitude. pc <dig> was mainly correlated with isothermality, i.e. temperature evenness across the year  .table  <dig>

genotyping by sequencing
the  <dig> samples were genotyped by sequencing, producing a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads. the number of reads produced was rather uneven among the various individuals, thereby lowering the amount of usable polymorphic loci. the number of snps selected for gwas  was  <dig> . the comparison between the tested bd <dig> inbred line and the bd <dig> reference sequence produced only  <dig> polymorphisms  of which  <dig> were due to heterozygous calls, thus supporting the correctness of snp calling. the analysis of the distribution of reads showed that some genomic bins were consistently not sequenced in all samples sharing the same sampling area, whereas reads corresponding to the same bin were present in samples coming from other regions.  <dig>  of such bins were characterized by either the presence or the absence of reads . those regions were grouped into  <dig>  continuous p/a regions spanning in length from the lowest arbitrary interval of  <dig>  bp up to  <dig>  bp .  <dig> % of the full genome of bd <dig> was masked when scanned with a library of b. distachyon specific transposable elements . the masking proportion rose to  <dig> % in the  <dig>  p/a, and dropped to  <dig> % when an equal number of non-p/a regions randomly drawn from the genome were considered .table  <dig>

diversity analyses and population genetics
the full set of filtered snps was used to produce a phylogeny by neighbour joining  clustering of uncorrected p distances, which highlighted an unexpected convergence in distant geographical areas . overall, the analysed b. distachyon local groups were clustered into a few strongly supported clades. individuals from the same sampling point mostly clustered together, suggesting a coincidence with biological populations having low variation. the local group e, split in two, was the sole exception. interestingly, local groups did not cluster according to their spatial distribution. the westernmost  and easternmost  locales grouped with high confidence, in contrast to local groups d, f, g and partially e. local groups c and c <dig>  which were only  <dig>  km apart, tightly clustered together but remained distinguishable, unveiling a low but detectable genetic differentiation at a small geographical scale.

the  <dig>  p/a regions were converted into binary markers on a local basis and used to calculate distances between local groups with jaccard’s similarity index. the resulting tree  is similar to that built from snps, suggesting that p/a regions are inherited in a similar way to molecular variation.figure  <dig>

pairwise fst  depicted a general scenario of scarce allele migrations and strong local fixation. when related to increasing geographical distances, however, the conditional genetic distance  showed almost no variation . this does not mean that the panel is not spatially clustered. in fact, quite the opposite is true: gene flow is low if not absent , especially between the two main clades also reported in the phylogeny. this is made clear by the incomplete population graph resulting from a spatial-aware molecular diversity analysis . a spatial pca also reported higher global than local genetic structure, and accounted most of the variance in the dataset to a single eigenvalue . again, this highlights the separation of sampling locations a, b and h from the rest.table  <dig>

a structure analysis conducted with bayesian methods pointed to the existence of five distinct genetic clusters, thus extending the geographical pattern that had already emerged from the previous analyses. samples from sampling locations a, b, c <dig>  and h were all assigned to the largest cluster. d, f, g mostly accounted for the second largest cluster. all samples from region e but one clustered in a third cluster. samples from region c shown some ancestry with those from c <dig> but acted as a separate cluster. the fifth cluster was contributed in small amounts by individuals from sampling location f. overall, the spatial genetic diversity displays strong structuration, but little correlation with spatial distance.

genomic loci with adaptive significance
the genomics of adaptation were explored at three levels. the main approach was derived from association studies, using the first three pcs accounting for environmental data as a fixed variable. latent factor mixed models  were used to evaluate signals of environmental adaptation, controlling for false positives by considering the five cryptic genetic clusters identified by structure. in parallel, a compressed mixed linear model  considering kinship  and structure  usually employed in gwas analyses was also used to identify loci associated with climatic data. kinship analysis confirmed the existence of two main genetic clusters already suggested by the previous analyses . when the cluster assignment provided by bayesian clustering analysis was introduced as a covariate in the model, it over-corrected for structuration . the pc method generally protects against structuration from genetic data  and was thus used together with kinship to correct the association analysis. the first five pcs calculated from molecular data were then used as q by visually evaluating the normal fit of the quantile-quantile plots generated by the model .figure  <dig> 
kinship analysis. kinship relationships among samples according to vanraden method. two main groups can be seen, the largest comprising mostly a, b, c, c <dig> and h individuals. the bimodal distribution of the kinship values confirm the results from diversity analyses, and probably would have biased the association analyses.



the outcome of both the association analyses was filtered with a corrected bonferroni criteria accounting for the dependency of statistical tests within linkage blocks identified by a linkage disequilibrium  analysis. the set of  <dig> b. distachyon samples chosen for association analysis showed a genome organized into  <dig> ld blocks containing between  <dig> and  <dig> snps. eighty snps were not associated with any ld block. after using bonferroni correction over  <dig> independent tests, every snp that yielded a p-value lower than  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  with environmental pc variables was deemed to be an environment-associated snp . the manhattan plot in figure  <dig> merges the lfmm and cmlm output. significant peaks have the expected skewed bell shape caused by linkage dragging markers nearby the most significant loci. brachypodium.org was used to gather the corresponding protein domains from the interpro database , when available.figure  <dig>

the lfmm approach identified alone  <dig> genes, pointed by  <dig> genic eass and  <dig> eass in the 5 kb upstream predicted genes  . the cmlm was more conservative, reporting  <dig> genic eass and  <dig> eass 5 kb upstream predicted genes, identifying  <dig> predicted genes . when the two analyses were merged, this revealed  <dig> eass pointing at  <dig> unique genes independently identified by both approaches .table  <dig>

the aim of our second approach was to identify genomic loci under selection by applying a bayesian outlier detection method. this analysis identified  <dig> outlier loci at an fdr of  <dig>  . a total of  <dig> unique loci were either 5kbp upstream  and/or inside   <dig> unique genes . loci identified as outliers did not overlap with significant associations identified by cmlm. the other association approach, the least conservative lfmm, identified  <dig> snp also being outlier loci, targeting  <dig> unique predicted genes highlighted in . the three methods showed an enrichment towards gene-related snps .table  <dig>

the third approach focused on the relation between p/a regions differentially distributed among b. distachyon locales and environmental pcs. a canonical correlation analysis  was used to quantify whether the environment could explain the differential distribution of p/a regions. the triplot in figure  <dig> shows some of the p/a regions linearly related with environmental pc: this analysis can be read as a classical cca in which sites are sampled groups , objects are p/a regions, and environmental vectors are represented by pcs. constrained axes accounted together for  <dig> % of the inertia. sites/objects appeared linearly related to each of the three sites/variables at a p <  <dig> ×10− <dig> after  <dig> permutations.figure  <dig>

putative genes involved in adaptation
we assayed the functional role of eass detected by both association methods, as representatives of the strongest signal for adaptation . environmental pc <dig> targets most of the genic eass. bradi1g <dig>  a 60s ribosomal protein l36-3-like, is probably involved in expression control. in maize, the 60s subunit is involved in flooding responses  <cit>  and might be related to environmental stress responses. the same eas targets on the reverse strand bradi1g <dig>  bearing an oxidoreductase activity domain. pc <dig> also targets a myb transcription factor  a class of proteins involved in plant responses processes, including those to abiotic stresses. myb are a strategic targets for crop improvement  <cit> . notably, we detected three outlier loci less than  <dig> kb downstream this association . the phosphoprotein phosphatase bradi1g <dig>  is likely involved in cellular signalling. signalling is also contributed by bradi3g <dig> . this predicted gene encodes for a 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase, whose elective biological processes include wax synthesis  <cit>  and response to cold and light stimulus . the energetic balance of the cell is possibly contributed by bradi1g <dig>  a sucrose transmembrane transporter targeted by pc <dig>  and bradi4g <dig>  targeted by pc <dig> and involved in the mitochondrial respiration chain. within  <dig> kb of this locus, two outlier loci are found . the eas at  <dig> ,155 bp on chromosome  <dig>  identified by both pc <dig> and pc <dig> is in the vicinity of a set of protein coding genes of unknown function.

discussion
the twofold gain of genotyping by sequencing
although genome re-sequencing offers the most inclusive possible overview of the genomic variability of small genome species  <cit> , methods based on the reduction of genome complexity such as gbs represent a cheaper and versatile alternative to genotype any species of interest in multiplex. however, due to the technical variations inherent in the protocol, a gbs run can yield an unbalanced representation of samples  <cit> . here we showed that such an unbalanced distribution might mask biological reasons that are actually worth investigating.

in our case, the persistence of phylogenetic relationships among samples when using p/a regions as genetic markers  suggest that there is an inheritable pattern that is consistent with the differential distribution of transposable elements   <cit> . in this case p/a regions may either result from the loss of the cut site because of te movement, or from the impairing of the methyl-sensitive apeki cleavage as a consequence of the presence of methylated dna regions.

in both cases, the coverage of sequencing reads will show a gap as a result of the failure of the enzymatic cut. p/a regions are clearly enriched in te, as demonstrated by the fact that the average te content in those regions is significantly higher than that of the entire genome . the enrichment is even more dramatic when the te content of regions not classified as p/a regions is taken into account . this evidence strongly suggests that te displacement has a role in the p/a polymorphism.

two simple scenarios could be envisaged to explain the data: i) tes inserted into the bd <dig> reference genome after it separated from the other populations  thus giving rise to p/a polymorphism; ii) tes are present in orthologous regions of both bd <dig> and resequenced samples, but they are methylated only in some of the resequenced regions.

as far as we are aware this structural variation, as revealed by gbs, has never been reported before. we believe that it is of great importance as it may introduce a significant bias in genomic imputation. our findings might stimulate further studies on the adaptive role of the differential distribution of transposable elements in b. distachyon natural populations. our cca analysis identified some of the p/a as being strongly related to environment, especially to pc <dig> and pc <dig> . modifications in methylation patterns associated with transposable elements have already been reported to influence a set of genes in  <dig> maize lines  <cit> .

approaching environmental associations
brachypodium distachyon proved to be an effective model for the application of landscape genomics. the high fst value between local groups  is in accordance with the expectancy for self-fertilizing plants  <cit> . the depletion of intra-population variation in presence autogamy is exacerbated by selective sweeps, background selection, and possibly recurrent extinctions and recolonizations  <cit> , as likely in our case. our results might appear to be in contrast with those from b. distachyon populations from the iberian peninsula, where ssr and issr markers showed an unexpectedly high intra-population variation  <cit> . we believe this might derive from the markers used, as ssr and issr sites change at a higher pace than coding regions targeted by gbs. in addition, as the authors suggest  <cit> , the high variation in the iberian populations might be linked to the proximity to the distribution limit of b. distachyon. on a broader scale, our snp-based survey showed that the genetic diversity did not linearly correlate with spatial distances. as expected local groups are highly differentiated, yet share similarities with individuals far away . this is why the correlation between cgd and physical distance is not significant, but spatial structuration is both evident from the population graph and spca analyses .

are we thus looking at isolation by distance ? ibd is the direct consequence of the limited dispersal of alleles, causing populations that are spatially near to share more similarities with each other than populations far away  <cit> . this phenomenon affects the exploitability of the molecular data derived from sampling natural populations  <cit> . the samples under study, though, do not show ibd in these terms. this is largely due to the split between locales a, b and h and all the others. while gene flow between local groups is low, there is no clear spatial pattern in the distribution of the genetic diversity.

given the erratic nature of the sampling, we cannot rule out that patterns of gene flow between populations apply, at a finer scale, to ibd, as it is outside the scope of this work. however, the use of these results is a key feature for our association mapping approach. ibd, as in general spatial structuration, can mirror environmental association, leading to high rates of false positives. this was demonstrated in  <cit> , where association methods without correction for population structure  found more significant associations than justified from the data if run in conditions of ibd. this happens in association methods because both climate and genetic variability have strong spatial dependencies which might lead to bias when overlapped. hierarchical structure tests are also known to be possibly biased by ibd  <cit> . our analyses showed extensive non-linear spatial structuration, as expected since the autogamous reproduction of b. distachyon. this finding is in line with a previous survey performed with  <dig> ssr markers on  <dig> turkish populations  <cit> , where b. distachyon accessions split into two distinct phylogenetic clades differing in terms of vernalization habits and morphological features without belonging clearly to a specific geographical area.

however, the absence of a diversity gradient did not rule out structuration. we thus performed our association approach by considering structuration in order to avoid overrepresentation of false positives. this was done both with a hierarchical structure and a pca with lfmm and cmlm, respectively, and we showed that the two different approaches yield similar results though differing in magnitude in terms of the statistical association found.

our results are an empirical confirmation of what emerged in a simulation study testing the performance of five outlier-based and three correlation methods under explicit models for selection, demography and spatial relations  <cit> . in that study, the outlier detection implemented in bayescan outperformed the other methods under any migration model, while all correlation-based methods proved powerful yet prone to bias due to structuration within and among populations. nevertheless, if coupled with methods accounting for cryptic genomic structure, such methods could reduce type i and type ii errors, especially in autogamous species. the portion of differentiated loci was in line with other studies  <cit> , confirming that the use of a conservative fdr threshold  and snp filtering lowered the noise resulting from the use of a high number of polymorphisms.

in-gene polymorphisms are not the sole ones involved in environmental adaptation  <cit> . in fact, snps in genes and 5 kb window upstream of the genes  show an almost equal contribution to significant associations  <cit> . this also emerges from our association and outlier loci analyses, which revealed the eass and outlier loci were enriched for genic and gene-related regions .

lack of congruence between methods
an interesting point concerns the differences that emerged between outlier and association methods, which here report little loci in common. this result does not seem to fit the early tendency of seeing outlier loci as a confirmation for eas validity and vice versa  <cit> . instead it highlights that association and outlier analyses estimate complementary aspects of functional adaptation, as recently suggested in similar studies  <cit> .

the association approach is not dependent upon population genetic parameters, instead it targets a limited set of quantitative environmental characteristics. complex traits targeted by means of correlative approaches, and especially those regarding climatic adaptation, are expected to reveal small changes in allele frequencies that push populations to a new optimum  <cit> . in this sense, polygenic selection  <cit>  would seem to favour the simultaneous presence of multiple alleles rather than a complete fixation at the loci involved  <cit> , resulting in the co-occurrence of different haplotypes at any given genomic location  <cit> . this contributes to the lack of congruence between the two methods, as a fainter signature of selection is less likely to be detected by outlier detection methods  <cit> . unsurprisingly, a low intensity selection causes bayescan to fail the most  <cit> . in addition, the ld-correction for false discovery rate possibly has an excessive number of type ii errors  <cit> . however, these kinds of studies benefit from a more conservative threshold than from a permissive approach. a few loci are in fact expected to have high enough effects to be confidently detected.

conversely, outlier methods do not depend, at least not directly, on environmental data. loci identified by bayescan but not by association methods might represent a set of loci under selection from factors not considered in the association analysis, such as fire regimes, soil composition, anthropic disturbance, grazing pressure, pathogens, and so on. outlier methods are also affected by the assumptions about the null distribution used to compare loci, making the demographic history and structure of populations able to bias the outcome of the analysis  <cit> . we argue that, at the net of false positives and negatives that might be effectively but not completely controlled by both methods, loci identified by both methods represent alternative portions of adaptive variation. outliers represent the pool of loci under the strongest selection, whereas eass represent the sum of the present and historical multilocus variations related to the environmental features considered.

a closer evaluation of the genes related to eass identified by both the association methods provided a varied set of putative functions . the annotation of brachypodium distachyon is currently based mostly on in silico models, and therefore needs a careful evaluation of the functional relevance of eass, which was outside the scopes of our experiments. yet, we identified a set of genes, including a myb transcription factor pointed by association and outlier loci, which already suggests the potential downstream applicability of these methods. owing to the nature of ld, however, a less-than complete coverage sequencing cannot achieve the single-gene definition in association: our analyses revealed that the genome of our b. distachyon collection could be split into  <dig> ld blocks. to achieve a higher definition, more recombination events should be sampled, i.e. more individuals are needed. this is one of the strengths of this approach: since it is modular it allows the stratification of environmental and biological data in an integrated framework to map for adaptation in b. distachyon.

CONCLUSIONS
we strongly support the application of next generation sequencing approaches to landscape genomics as a fast and modular tool for the discovery of adaptive traits, particularly in sequenced species. the application of landscape genomics to plants akin to crops can directly address adaptive variation that would be of great interest from an applied perspective. we noted that, when structuration is accounted for, the methodological effort to discover loci responsible for environmental adaptation might trace back to gwas. this means that advances and statistics built by the complex trait mapping community could be exploited to gather information in the field.

our results derive from a modular method that can be extended in order to deal with any relevant environmental questions. although our initial set of genotypes and environmental variables is limited, we believe that this and similar collections will soon be enlarged to provide a better capacity to map environmental adaptation. b. distachyon - like other model species - is thus not only an effective laboratory tool, but also a natural probe. by exploiting their geographical distribution, these model species could be used to identify functional variation, and ultimately genomic loci, whose evolution was shaped for survival well before artificial selection took place. we envisage this approach being directly applied to crops, focusing either on their wild relatives or landraces, to cleverly incorporate in agronomy the results of natural selection efforts.
