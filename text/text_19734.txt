BACKGROUND
modelling of gene regulatory networks  has become a widely used computational approach in systems biology  <cit> . this development has been greatly promoted by the availability of high-throughput data of adequate amount and quality, such as genome-wide expression data. a major task is the inference of regulatory dependencies between genes on the basis of such data. the inferred gene interactions constitute a network, which contains predictions about cellular regulation. they can motivate the design of new experiments, which might validate predicted dependencies and potentially elucidate unknown regulatory interactions. successful applications of grns have been presented in studies of specific human diseases like cancer  <cit>  and rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> ), murine hepatocytes  <cit> , e. coli <cit>  and fungal infection  <cit> .

in this study, we focus on the involvement of micrornas  in the gene regulation of human mesenchymal stem cells  which differentiate towards chondrocytes. therefore, we provide a biological background about hmscs, characteristics and function of mirnas and modelling approaches which integrate mirna regulation. hmscs are multi-potent adult stem cells, which have the capacity to differentiate into multiple cell types, such as chondrocytes, osteoblasts and adipocytes  <cit> . lineage commitment towards a certain type of cell depends on specific environmental factors. those factors can activate intracellular signalling pathways which control developmental genes and other signalling pathways. here, we focus on chondrogenic differentiation, which is characterised by a sequence of intermediate developmental stages, including cell condensation, proliferation, differentiation and hypertrophy  <cit> . each of the individual processes is associated with the activity and regulation of lineage-specific genes  <cit>  encoding transcription factors  or ligands of distinct signalling pathways   <cit> . stimulation of hmscs by tgf-beta <dig> initiates the process of chondrogenic differentiation  <cit> . although key regulatory genes have been determined, the entire process of regulation in chondrogenesis is still not fully understood. in the recent years, it has become apparent that mirnas are active regulators in the development of stem cells  <cit> .

mirnas are short , noncoding rna molecules, which are able to bind to complementary sequences in target mrnas, thereby repressing translation or inducing degradation of mrna molecules  <cit> . silencing of gene expression by such post-transcriptional processes has been identified as a new level of gene regulation which is capable of modulating expression levels. in the human genome, more than two thousand mature mirnas have been identified  <cit> . much effort has been put into the revelation of the complex functional network of mirna and target gene regulation. according to sequence-based predictions, a single mirna can target hundreds of genes, while a gene can be regulated by multiple mirnas  <cit> . considering the biological function of the target genes, mirnas were found to regulate various signalling pathways as well as the cell cycle. interestingly, transcription factor genes are preferred targets of mirnas  <cit> .

network inference approaches have considered the emerging knowledge about mirna-dependent regulation by taking account of interactions between mirnas and mrnas. such approaches utilise mirna target predictions as well as mirna and mrna expression data. consideration of post-transcriptional gene regulation has been contributing to the extension and refinement of grns. this new feature has promoted the analysis of dependencies between mirnas and target genes. for example, tools like magia  <cit> , mmia  <cit>  and mirconnx  <cit>  perform integrated network analysis on the basis of mirna target predictions and correlation between mirna and mrna expression profiles.

this study aims to present the inference of mirna regulation as a novel application for the previously published netgenerator v <dig>  tool. the focus of this work is integrated network inference based on mrna and mirna time series data and prior knowledge  <cit> . the resulting network predicts the role of selected mirnas in the chondrogenic regulatory network. in comparison to correlation-based approaches , the netgenerator tool applies a dynamical model, which is based on linear ordinary differential equations . previous network inference studies have successfully shown the ability of linear approaches to result in network models of high biological relevance  <cit> . experimental verification of predicted interactions underscored their validity, while it is often emphasised that biological processes can include more complex relationships  <cit> .

RESULTS
chondrogenesis data and node selection
we analysed a dataset which contained mrna and mirna microarray measurements of cultured hmscs in pellet cultures after stimulation with growth factors tgf-beta <dig> and bmp <dig>  both factors are known to induce the process of chondrogenesis  <cit> . microarray samples were available for  <dig> time points  h after stimulation, with  <dig>  and  <dig>  replicates per time point. for mrna microarray data pre-processing, custom chip definition files  <cit>  were used in order to improve the accuracy of the expression estimates. quantile normalisation was applied to mrna and mirna microarray data, respectively . this resulted in time series expression data for  <dig>  protein-coding genes  and  <dig>  mirnas. integrated network inference requires the filtering of relevant mrnas and mirnas, which constitute the network nodes in the model. a multi-step selection strategy was applied, which included statistical filtering, knowledge-based filtering and time series correlation, to identify mirnas and genes that are associated with the investigated differentiation process. a workflow which illustrates the sequence of selection procedures, starting from microarray data and resulting in network components, is displayed in figure  <dig>  differentially expressed genes  and differentially expressed mirnas  were identified using the limma package of the bioconductor software suite, as described in the methods section. it resulted in the selection of  <dig> degs and  <dig> demirs. subsequently, both sets were used to perform a knowledge-driven selection, which was based on mirna target predictions and prior knowledge about gene regulation during hmsc differentiation. it is known that the transition from stem cells to terminally differentiated cells is mainly controlled by transcription factors  <cit> . moreover, transcription factor genes are reported to be potential targets of mirnas, because they are significantly overrepresented among the mirna target genes  <cit> . consequently, transcription factor genes from the gene ontology term go: <dig>  were selected, resulting in  <dig> differentially expressed transcription factor genes . in the next step, predicted interactions between mirnas and target genes were considered, as they provide a useful subset of linked mirna and mrna data. there are numerous resources of experimentally validated or computationally predicted interactions between mirnas and target mrnas, such as tarbase  <cit> , miranda  <cit> , mirbase  <cit> , mirtarget <dig>  <cit>  and targetscan  <cit> . access to these databases is provided by the r package rmir.hs.mirna, which provides the possibility to download the data in form of interaction tables. taken together, there are more than  <dig> million predicted interactions stored in these tables. however, most prediction approaches are reported to have relatively low specificity  <cit> . this issue can be addressed by combining the sequence-based predictions with predictions based on the temporal correlation of mirna and target genes. to obtain the most reliable interaction predictions, two criteria were applied:  at least two of the five above mentioned databases must contain the interaction and  the associated expression time series of mirna and mrna must be negatively correlated. the first criterion ensures that the considered interactions were found by different approaches. to check the second criterion, the pearson correlation coefficient between mirna and mrna time series was calculated for each interaction pair. under the assumption that the predicted mirna target gene interaction is functional, we would intuitively expect a negative correlation coefficient, due to the negative regulatory effect of the mirna on the expression of its mrna target. this assumption could be confirmed by liu et al.  <cit> , who successfully identified mirna targets by correlation. however, the authors also emphasise that a strong mirna effect on target gene expression might be better recognisable on target protein level or downstream gene expression levels. moreover, we noted that positive as well as negative correlations have been reported in the literature for functional mirna target relations  <cit> . in this study, we merely focused on strongly negatively correlated mirna-gene pairs, which can be explained by a repressing interaction between the mirna and its target. accordingly, four interactions with a pearson correlation coefficient smaller than - <dig>  were extracted . in other words, focusing on negatively correlated interactions resulted in the selection of  <dig> demirs and  <dig> detfs.

predicted mirna target genes, corresponding prediction methods and the attained time series correlation.

as reported in the literature, there are prominent chondrogenesis marker genes such as col2a <dig>  acan  and col10a <dig>  whose expression level indicates the progress of differentiation  <cit> . they encode for structural proteins of the extracellular matrix  and are differentially expressed in our time series data. therefore, we added them to the selection of network nodes, because marker genes help to monitor the effects of regulation by mirnas and transcription factors on chondrogenic differentiation.

in summary, the applied multi-step selection procedure resulted in a set of  <dig> network components, including  <dig> mirnas ,  <dig> transcription factor genes  and  <dig> chondrogenic marker genes coding for components of the extracellular matrix .

network inference
the netgenerator tool was applied to infer a system of linear ordinary differential equations, which describes a network of regulatory interactions between the components and the influence of the external stimulus . the general model structure and the utilised optimisation approach is explained in the methods section. input data for the tool comprised time series data and prior knowledge about potential regulatory interactions between the components. time series data were extracted from the available mirna and mrna microarray datasets, averaged across replicates at each time point, centered and scaled by their maximum absolute value . the resulting time series matrix has  <dig> rows  and  <dig> columns  . prior knowledge about regulatory interactions between the nodes was collected from diverse sources, which will be described below.

extraction of prior knowledge
we considered knowledge about the general regulatory potential of each component as well as knowledge about regulatory interactions among the components for grn inference. for the three component classes  mirna,  transcription factor gene,  marker/target gene), prior knowledge regarding the typical biological function was derived as follows:  mirnas primarily function by degradation of their target mrnas  <cit> . therefore, they are expected to downregulate the expression of their respective target genes.  transcription factors positively or negatively regulate the expression of their target genes, which can be protein-coding genes as well as mirna precursor genes.  genes encoding structural components of the extracellular matrix are not known to have an effect on the expression of neither protein-coding genes nor mirna genes. therefore, they were considered to be pure target genes, whose expression is regulated by transcription factors and mirnas. in addition to this annotation-based knowledge, a set of potential regulatory interactions was obtained from mirna target predictions, as described in the previous section, and scientific literature. this included four predicted interactions between mirnas and target genes, which have not been reported in previous studies . to extract regulatory interactions from published work, pathway studio v <dig> was applied, which provides a database of interactions automatically derived from pubmed  <cit> . in total, four interactions from transcription factors on target genes were retrieved from the database. sox <dig> was found to regulate the expression of col2a <dig>  acan and col10a <dig> by specifically binding to regulatory elements in the promoter region of these genes  <cit> . the chondrocyte hypertrophic marker col10a <dig> is activated by mef2c, which binds to conserved sequences in the promoter region of col10a <dig>  <cit> . finally, the collected prior knowledge was stored in form of interaction matrices , which can be processed by netgenerator.

model inference and interpretation
the netgenerator approach aims to identify a set of model parameters which is optimal with respect to the given input data and the presumption of a sparse interaction matrix. the algorithm’s objective is to minimise the model error j, which quantifies the deviation between measured and simulated data, and to consider prior knowledge. the balance between network complexity and an adequate model error is controlled by the parameter “allowederror”, which is the permitted maximum error for each time series. a series of inference results varying this parameter was analysed with respect to the model error, the model complexity  and the number of correctly integrated known connections . this resulted in the selection of an optimised model, which shows a good fit to the measured time series data  and contains  <dig> known interactions. simulated and measured time series are compared in figure  <dig>  the simulated time courses  show a good reproduction of the measured time series data . even if the model seems to be excellent in terms of the objectives mentioned above, a model validation is necessary. the main reason is to prevent over-fitting of the measured time series data by the model. therefore, the model’s robustness against noise in the data was evaluated by using an approach which is based on repeated resampling of the time series data . this procedure resulted in a table of occurrence frequencies for each interaction of the optimised model . while most of the connections attained a high frequency, two connections with a frequency less than 40% were discarded from the network. all remaining interactions were considered robust against minor fluctuations in the expression data. the final network  consists of  <dig> nodes, thereof  <dig> mirnas,  <dig> transcription factors  and  <dig> target genes , and of the external stimulus . there are  <dig> stable connections in the network, which indicate transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation, depending on the type of the connected components. considering the proportion of nodes and connections  the network appears to be sparsely connected. there are  <dig> input-to-node and  <dig> node-to-node interactions. the latter type of interactions can be further grouped into mirna-mirna , mirna-tf , tf-mirna  and tf-target  interactions. four connections are coloured in green, which indicates their concordance with literature knowledge. four connections are coloured in blue, because they are underpinned by predicted mirna target sites. connections coloured in black represent hypothetical regulatory interactions without further evidence.

biological interpretation
the biological interpretation of the network will be based on transcription factor nodes , by identifying regulator and target nodes for each of them. this promotes the understanding of the model, particularly of the mechanism that enables mirnas to interfere with transcriptional regulation in order to control the differentiation process. as seen in the final model, the input stimulus  inhibits the expression of  <dig> mirnas  and activates mir- <dig>  which is in turn suppressed by trps <dig>  consequently, the negative effect of downregulated mirnas on their target genes is attenuated, which leads to the activation of the transcription factor genes sox <dig>  mef2c, trps <dig> and satb <dig>  sox <dig>  the main regulatory factor in chondrogenesis  <cit> , is inhibited by mir-524-5p, a finding which is supported by a predicted mirna target site . since mir-524-5p expression is suppressed by the tgf-beta1+bmp <dig> stimulus, sox <dig> expression increases and leads to activation of the differentiation markers col2a <dig>  acan and col10a <dig>  this transactivation is enabled by the presence of a consensus binding motif caag), which is shared by the sox family members  <cit> . in col2a <dig>  multiple copies of this motif could be identified in an enhancer located in intron  <dig>  activation of acan could be associated with the binding of sox <dig> in its first intron  <cit>  and the col10a <dig> promoter contains a distal enhancer element  <dig>  kb upstream of the transcription start site  <cit> . therefore, primary chondrogenesis might be under control of mir-524-5p through the modulation of the expression of sox <dig> and its target genes. the mads box transcription factor mef2c, which controls chondrogenic hypertrophy, positively regulates expression of col10a <dig> through binding to conserved sequences in the promoter region  <cit> . negative regulation of mef2c by mir- <dig> might be a mechanism to prevent early activation of hypertrophic genes. the transcriptional repressor trps <dig> is known to be activated by a specific type of bmp-signalling and promotes chondrogenic differentiation by transcriptional repression of only a few known target genes  <cit> . in our model, its expression is regulated by the stimulus as well as by mir- <dig> and mir-524-5p. the interaction with mir- <dig> is underpinned by prior knowledge , but surprisingly there is also a predicted binding site for mir-524-5p within the trps <dig> mrna. however, the positive sign of the connection suggests that the assumed inhibitory effect may be not reflected by the given data. in recent literature, extensive control of trps <dig> by at least  <dig> mirnas has been described for the process of skeletal development  <cit> . in the network, trps <dig> inhibits the expression of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  which controls the chondrogenic transcription factor mef2c. while knowledge about target genes of trps <dig> is rare, it is known that trps <dig> can upregulate the chondrogenic marker gene col10a <dig> and thereby promote chondrogenic differentiation  <cit> . satb <dig>  a transcription factor mainly associated with osteogenesis  <cit> , is repressed by mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  as predicted by the model. a potential regulation of satb <dig> by mir- <dig> is supported by the associated binding sequence . however, since there is no influence of satb <dig> on the expression of chondrogenic marker genes in the network, it is less relevant for chondrogenesis according to our model.

to summarise, the involvement of transcription factor genes is a central part of the model. the model integrates transcriptional regulation  and post-transcriptional regulation  and thereby displays the interrelationship between mirnas and transcription factors. since all four investigated mirnas are ultimately downregulated, the model proposes the suppression of mirna activity, which gives rise to the activation of the transcriptional regulators of chondrogenic differentiation such as sox <dig>  the model comprises mirnas acting on different stages of the differentiation process including early proliferation and late hypertrophic stages. the downregulation of mir-524-5p provides an interesting explanation about how chondrogenic differentiation might be modulated on the level of post-transcriptional mrna interference. furthermore, we found expression of mir-524-5p to be differently regulated during osteogenic and adipogenic hmsc differentiation . this indicates that the repression of mir-524-5p activity may be relevant for lineage specificity during hmsc differentiation. previous studies have reported that mir-524-5p is active in glioma cells and interacts with two components of the notch signalling pathway  <cit> .

experimental validation
the inferred chondrogenic network implies that mir-524-5p is able to target sox <dig> mrna, thereby inhibiting expression of sox <dig> and its target genes . therefore, we performed overexpression experiments of mir-524-5p in hmscs to validate if chondrogenesis is impaired in this case. changes in chondrogenic differentiation were measured based on the expression of specific marker genes. for this, hmscs were transfected with lentivirus harbouring the mir-524-5p coding sequence, while a non-related murine jnk rnai lentivirus was used as a negative control. then, hmscs were allowed to differentiate for  <dig> days into chondrocytes after which the expression of chondrogenic marker genes was measured by using qpcr. relative expression of marker genes of transfected cells was compared to the negative control  and a positive control  in which differentiation occurs in culture medium but without lentiviral transduction . the positive control sets the baseline for comparison of the different expression levels, because differentiation is optimal. the results showed that mir-524-5p overexpression decreases the relative expression of all measured marker genes. the decrease in relative expression is significantly stronger than the decrease observed when using the non-related murine jnk rnai lentivirus. this negative control had no effect on chondrogenesis observed for all marker genes tested. in addition, hmscs were transfected with mir-524-5p lentivirus and the empty pmirna backbone  vector lentivirus  and, subsequently, cells were allowed to differentiate for  <dig> days prior rna qpcr analysis. the relative expression of sox <dig> decreased when mir-524-5p was overexpressed and the control virus  remained comparable to the relative expression of the positive control . in conclusion, experimental validation showed that lentiviral based overexpression experiments of mir-524-5p in differentiating hmscs resulted in a significant inhibition of several chondrogenic marker genes compared to either non-transfected hmscs or transfected with a control lentivirus.

CONCLUSIONS
this study presented and analysed large-scale mirna time series expression data, which captures the post-transcriptional level of chondrogenic differentiation of hmscs. the combination of mirna and mrna microarray data enabled the identification of mirnas which potentially act in this developmental process. to detect the most relevant mirnas, a custom filtering based on diverse biological prior knowledge  in conjunction with statistical criteria was applied. four mirnas  were found to be potentially involved in the regulation of chondrogenesis. to infer an integrated network of mirna and gene regulation, we presented a novel application of the netgenerator tool i.e. its capability to integrate mirna and mrna time series data into a single network inference. the good quality of the resulting network model with regard to complexity, data fit and robustness underlines the tool’s utility to infer the post-transcriptional level of gene regulation. analysis of the network resulted in hypotheses and additional experiments which verified model predictions by showing that mir-524-5p can affect the expression of the central transcription factor gene sox <dig> and differentiation marker genes. therefore, this work demonstrated how dynamic modelling of mirna regulation can enhance the understanding of a specific biological process and lead to the discovery of new regulatory interactions.
