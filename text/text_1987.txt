BACKGROUND
accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum  leads to the activation of the unfolded protein response  that serves to counteract this situation by transiently attenuating protein translation, followed by induction of a transcriptional response that increases the levels of genes involved in er and secretory pathway function  <cit> . the upr is an adaptive program that in metazoans is mediated by three er stress response sensors, perk, ire <dig> and atf <dig>  these are er-localized transmembrane proteins that sense the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the er and initiate signal transduction cascades that mediate the output of the upr. the perk pathway reduces global translation via phosphorylation of eif2α  <cit> , that in turn enhances translation of the atf <dig> transcription factor  <cit> . ire <dig> activation in response to er stress leads to the splicing of the xbp <dig> mrna and translation of the xbp <dig> transcription factor in mammalian cells  <cit> , while atf <dig> is an er-localized protein that is activated by regulated intramembrane proteolysis in the golgi to release an active transcription factor  <cit> . each of these transcription factors regulates genes involved in the upr, although there is overlap in the genes controlled by these proteins. furthermore, there is wide variability in the expression and relative abundance of various er chaperone and co-chaperone proteins in different eukaryotic cells  <cit> , likely due to the nature of the protein products produced by different cell types. thus, highly specialized cells such as insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cells have a unique chaperone expression profile compared to other cell types and likely have a unique upr output  <cit> .

in addition to the cell survival output of the upr, if er stress remains persistent and these pathways remain active for prolonged periods then apoptosis can be initiated that involves a number of potential pathways, including prolonged expression of pro-apoptotic transcription factors such as chop, jnk stress kinase activation, and the ire1-dependent degradation  activity of ire <dig> that non-selectively degrades mrnas in the vicinity of the er membrane  <cit> .

er stress has been implicated in contributing to pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and death resulting in the development of diabetes. this is evident in rodents and human patients with certain mutations in the insulin gene that cause misfolding of proinsulin in the er  <cit>  and in rodents and patients with mutations in the perk gene  <cit> . er stress has also been implicated in contributing to pancreatic β-cell dysfunction in more common forms of diabetes associated with obesity. several studies have reported increased er stress markers in pancreatic islets in rodent models of obesity and diabetes and in humans with type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> . furthermore, we recently showed that enhanced chaperone capacity in pancreatic β-cells can improve β-cell function and protect c57bl/ <dig> mice from developing glucose intolerance in response to a high fat diet  <cit> . thus, understanding how pancreatic β-cells respond to er stress may prove beneficial in developing strategies to improve cell function and survival as potential treatment options for the disease.

to elucidate the upr in pancreatic β-cells we recently identified gene expression changes resulting from the expression of a mutant proinsulin in an insulinoma cell culture model  <cit> . expression of the akita mutant insulin  <dig>  resulted in induction of various genes involved in er and secretory pathway function. furthermore, prolonged expression of the misfolded proinsulin also leads to detection of cell apoptosis in the population  <cit> . here we have taken advantage of recently described inhibitors of ire <dig> endoribonuclease activity  <cit>  to analyse the role of the ire1/xbp <dig> pathway in the upr in this cell line and the effect on er stress-induced apoptosis. we find that the ire <dig> pathway is required for maximal induction of most upr target genes, but unexpectedly does not sensitize the cells against chronic er stress-induced apoptosis.

methods
cell culture
rat ins- <dig> insulinoma cells were obtained from dr. claus wollheim   <cit> . ins <dig> 832/ <dig> insulinoma cells were obtained from dr. chris newgard   <cit> . ins- <dig>  cells  were generated as described  <cit> . these cell lines were maintained as described in the respective references.

microarray analysis
ins- <dig>  cells  were treated with or without dox , dox with 4μ8c , or 4μ8c  alone for 48 h. two independent experiments were performed and total rna was isolated using trizol reagent  followed by isolation using an rneasy mini kit . assessment of rna quality and microarray analysis was performed at the university health network microarray centre as described previously  <cit> .

genes with multiple probesets were averaged to produce a single fold change value for each gene. fold change values for both dox/untreated and dox4μ8c/untreated were log <dig> transformed. these were then plotted. all analysis was done in r .

rna isolation and real-time pcr analysis
total rna was isolated from rat ins- <dig>  cells or mouse islets using trizol  and real-time pcr analysis was performed using the taqman gene expression system  as described previously  <cit> . gene-specific primers and control β-actin primers were obtained from life technologies: trib3: rn00595314_m1; herp: rn00585371_m1; sdf2l1: rn01404682_m1; dnajb9: rn00562259_m1; grp78/bip: rn01435771_g1; chop: rn00492098_g1; edem1: rn01421307_m1; txnip: rn01533891_g <dig>  the xbp <dig> splicing assay was performed as described previously  <cit> .

cell apoptosis assay
cell apoptosis was measured using the cell death detection elisa kit  according to the instructions provided in the kit and in reference  <cit> . the elisa assay detects oligonucleosomes in the cytosol, as an indicator of apoptotic cells.

mts cell viability assay
ins- <dig>  cells  cells were either left untreated or treated with 2 μg/ml doxycycline, 2 μg/ml doxycycline and 5 μm 4μ8c or 5 μm 4μ8c alone. after 48 h  <dig>  cells/100 μl of media from each treatment well were seeded into a 96-well plate in duplicates. the celltiter  <dig> aqueous non-radioactive cell proliferation assay mts  was performed according to the instructions provided in the kit. briefly, 20 μl of the combined pms/mts mixture was added to each well and incubated for 4 h at 37°c and 5% co <dig>  the absorbance at 490 nm was then measured with a plate reader.

western blot analysis
proteins were resolved using 10% sds-page gels or 4-12% nupage gels  and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described in  <cit> . antibodies: γ-tubulin, sigma-aldrich ; gm <dig>  bd biosciences ; gfp, clontech, ; kdel, stressgen, ; insulin, santa cruz biotech. ; cleaved caspase  <dig>  cell signaling, ; phospho-eif2α, cell signaling, ; herp .

RESULTS
expression of a mutant proinsulin c96y-gfp fusion protein causes er stress, induction of the upr and apoptosis in a cultured insulinoma cell line we generated previously  <cit> . to define the role of the ire <dig> pathway in the upr in this model system we used a recently described ire <dig> inhibitor 4μ8c that specifically inhibits the endoribonuclease activity of ire <dig> and prevents splicing of the xbp <dig> mrna in response to er stress  <cit> . we initially tested whether 4μ8c affects doxycycline-induced mutant proinsulin-gfp expression and the effect of the inhibitor on cell survival, apoptosis and xbp <dig> splicing. the compound 4μ8c had no effect on mutant insulin expression induced by doxycycline or cell viability up to 10 μm . however, at concentrations >25 μm cell loss was observed and apoptotic cells were detected as monitored by cleaved caspase  <dig> protein expression . consequently, for all subsequent experiments 5 μm 4μ8c was used. at this concentration xbp <dig> splicing in response to mutant proinsulin expression or thapsigargin treatment was completely prevented . as expected, the inhibitor had no effect on mutant proinsulin or thapsigargin-induced activation of the perk pathway as monitored by ser <dig> phosphorylation of eif2α .

to examine the effect of ire <dig> inhibition on global mrna expression in response to misfolded proinsulin expression, we treated cells with dox for 48 h to induce mutant proinsulin in either the presence or absence of 4μ8c and performed microarray analysis from two independent experiments. the inhibitor alone did not affect gene expression changes ≥ <dig>  fold. doxycycline treatment lead to ≥ <dig>  fold induction of ~ <dig> genes, most of which were previously observed to be increased by mutant proinsulin expression  <cit> . this is summarized in figure  <dig> and highlighted in the top and right boxes. surprisingly, a large subset of these genes  are no longer upregulated ≥ <dig>  fold , while ~30% are still upregulated when the inhibitor was added in the presence of dox . however, genes that were still induced ≥ <dig>  fold in the presence of the inhibitor usually exhibit lower expression than with dox alone . the induction of only  <dig> genes appeared to be not affected by the inhibitor. thus, it appears that the ire <dig> pathway contributes to the induction or maximal induction of the majority of genes in response to mutant proinsulin expression.

treatment with dox for 48 h also leads to the down-regulation of a number of genes ≥ <dig>  fold . the down-regulation of most of these genes is dependent on ire <dig> as the presence of the inhibitor reduces or prevents the down-regulation of the majority of these genes .the microarray analysis suggests that maximal induction of most genes is dependent on ire <dig> activity. we validated some of the well-established upr genes by quantitative pcr. as shown in figure  <dig>  ire <dig> inhibition had no effect on the induction of the major upr gene grp <dig>  but did prevent maximal induction of most of the genes examined, including sdf2l <dig>  dnajb9/erdj <dig>  herp and edem <dig>  we also examined pro-apototic genes in response to dox with or without inhibitor. chop mrna levels are not significantly affected by 48 h mutant proinsulin. however, other pro-apoptotic genes such as trib <dig> and txnip that are induced by mutant proinsulin expression are reduced by the inhibitor . in summary, most well-established upr genes are still induced when ire <dig> activity is completely inhibited, although the general response appears to be blunted compared to control cells.

we also validated some of these results using a structurally distinct small molecule inhibitor of ire- <dig> endoribonuclease activity, mkc- <dig>  <cit> . mkc- <dig> also completely inhibited xbp- <dig> splicing in response to er stress  and produced effects on the induction of several upr genes very similar to 4μ8c .

we previously showed that misfolded proinsulin degradation occurs via er-associated degradation   <cit> , a mechanism that retrotranslocates misfolded proteins in the er lumen to the cytosol for degradation by the proteasome  <cit> . to further support this notion we examined the effect of inhibiting the atpase p97/vcp component of the erad machinery using the inhibitor dbeq  <cit> . mutant proinsulin was induced by dox for 24 h, then cycloheximide was added to prevent new protein synthesis and the cells were chased for 6 h with and without dbeq. inhibition of p97/vcp reduced mutant proinsulin degradation . we therefore examined if inhibition of ire <dig> activity would affect mutant proinsulin degradation. as shown in figure 5b,c, the ire <dig> inhibitor 4μ8c had no significant effect on misfolded proinsulin degradation. this is consistent with the fact that the erad gene herp is still induced in the presence of ire <dig> inhibitors , as is the herp protein . thus, erad degradation of mutant proinsulin is not significantly affected by inhibition of the ire <dig> pathway in these cells.finally, we examined the effect of the ire <dig> inhibitor on apoptosis in the mutant insulin expressing cell line. we hypothesized that since activation of the upr was compromised by the inhibitor that this might sensitize the cells to apoptosis induced by chronic mutant proinsulin expression. general cell viability as monitored by an mts assay was not significantly affected by mutant insulin expression or the 4μ8c inhibitor . mutant proinsulin expression however, induced apoptosis as monitored with a sensitive cell death elisa assay that detects cytoplasmic oligonucleosomes and 4μ8c had no significant effect . we also monitored cleaved caspase  <dig> levels by western blot analysis. cleaved caspase  <dig> was detected in response to mutant proinsulin expression and was further increased when cells were cultured in the presence of additional stress caused by high glucose . as expected, the level of cleaved caspase  <dig> even in the presence of high glucose was much less compared to commonly used thapsigargin or tunicamycin treatments that induce er stress. the inhibitor had no effect on cleaved caspase  <dig> levels induced by mutant proinsulin expression in the presence of high glucose .

discussion
in this study we examined the effect of ire <dig> pathway inhibition on the upr in a cell culture model of er stress caused by expression of a misfolded mutant proinsulin. we found that inhibition of ire <dig> endoribonuclease activity using selective inhibitors resulted in a generally blunted gene expression output, although no effect was observed on the kinetics of mutant proinsulin degradation, nor the sensitivity of the cells to apoptosis.

ire1/xbp- <dig> has been shown to regulate a variety of genes in various cell types in response to er stress, mostly related to er function and the secretory pathway, although the target genes vary depending on the cell type and nature of the stress stimuli  <cit> . in the proinsulin c96y-gfp model of er stress numerous genes related to er function, the secretory pathway and er-associated degradation are increased. here we show that some genes such as grp <dig> are completely ire- <dig> independent, which is consistent with grp <dig> not requiring xbp- <dig> for its induction  <cit> . however, most other genes induced require ire <dig> at least for maximal induction in response to mutant proinsulin-induced er stress.

previously we showed that perturbation of the erad pathway either by herp knock-down or proteasome inhibition significantly perturbs mutant proinsulin degradation and significantly enhances susceptibility to apoptosis  <cit> . although the extent of the increase in gene expression was reduced for most genes in the presence of the inhibitor, genes such as those coding for erad components are still increased. this may explain the lack of effect of the inhibitor on the degradation of the mutant proinsulin and indicates that ire <dig> output is not essential for maintaining erad capacity.

perhaps not surprisingly then, the inhibitor did not increase susceptibility to apoptosis caused by mutant proinsulin expression. several possibilities could contribute to a lack of effect on cell apoptosis, including reduced ridd activity in response to chronic stress caused by the misfolded proinsulin, in addition to less induction of some pro-apoptotic genes such as trb <dig>  <cit>  and txnip  <cit> . combined with no compromise in erad or ability to induce the main er chaperone bip/grp <dig>  cells are no worse off if the ire <dig> pathway is inhibited in the context of chronic er stress caused by mutant proinsulin expression. our results are consistent with the effect of the inhibitor in other secretory cells where inhibition of ire <dig> reduced expansion of secretory capacity, but did not sensitize the cells to er stress  <cit> .

ire <dig> activation results in the production of the xbp <dig> transcription factor that in vivo is required for the development of various secretory cells including pancreatic cells  <cit> . indeed, disruption of the xbp <dig> gene in pancreatic β-cells in mice using the rip-cre system resulted in hyperglycemia and abnormal β-cell function caused by decreased insulin secretion, decreased insulin granule content and impaired insulin processing  <cit> . in addition, depletion of xbp <dig> resulted in constitutive hyperactivation of ire <dig> including its ridd activity  <cit> . thus, although inhibition of ire <dig> in the context of the akita insulin mutation does not sensitize the cells to increased apoptosis, it is possible that inhibition of ire <dig> in vivo in a physiological context might be detrimental to pancreatic β-cell survival.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, although inhibition of ire <dig> compromised the full extent of upr output in response to chronic er stress caused by misfolded proinsulin expression, inhibition of ire <dig> did not significantly affect erad or sensitize the cells to apoptosis. future studies need to examine the effect of ire <dig> inhibition in akita mice and other more common models of rodent diabetes to determine whether targeting the ire <dig> pathway could be of benefit to reducing pancreatic cell death caused by chronic er stress.
