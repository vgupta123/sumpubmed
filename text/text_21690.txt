BACKGROUND
vertebrate genomes are typically densely packed with transposable elements that can account for almost half of all genomic dna. historically thought of as only parasitic elements, recently it has become clear that the influence of transposons on genomic structure and function in vertebrates is complex  <cit> . for instance it has been shown that many transposon-derived sequences have been exapted into functional roles such as regulatory elements controlling gene expression  <cit>  and contributing to proteome diversity through introduction of cryptic splice sites and exonization  <cit> . alternatively, transposon insertion into functional dna can be deleterious as is demonstrated by the event of genetic diseases resulting from de novo transposon insertions  <cit> . nevertheless, transposons are pervasive features of mammalian genomes , suggesting that the majority of insertion events are easily tolerated and are not significantly deleterious to the host. we recently described the presence of regions between  <dig> and  <dig> kb long in the human, mouse and opossum genomes that appear to be unable to tolerate any transposon insertions which suggests these regions are either densely packed with discrete functional elements or represent unusually long functional units  <cit> .

these transposon-free regions  cannot be explained using random models of transposon insertion, and are often associated with genes that play important roles in development, such as members of the hox, sox, fox and tbx gene families  <cit> . although most human, mouse and opossum transposon insertions have occurred independently in each linage, the majority of large human tfrs are also transposon-free in the orthologous regions of the mouse and opossum genomes  <cit> . tfrs have been maintained at many loci at least since the last common ancestor of placental mammals and marsupials, about  <dig> million years  <cit> . intriguingly, all members of several gene families, such as the hox clusters and the irx family, are contained within tfrs. this suggests that the mechanism responsible for the maintenance of tfrs may have been active for over  <dig> million years, since the gene duplication events that originally gave rise to these families  <cit> . to investigate this possibility we looked for tfrs in more distant vertebrate lineages whose genomes have since been sequenced, i.e., fish and frog.

here we report  <dig> transposon-free regions ≥  <dig> kb and  <dig>  tfrs ≥  <dig> kb in zebrafish demonstrating that tfrs are a common feature of vertebrate genomes. many zebrafish tfrs are orthologous to tfrs in mammals and frog suggesting these tfrs have been present and maintained since the dawn of the vertebrate lineage.

RESULTS
of the three sequenced fish genomes, only the zebrafish genome exhibits a high density of transposons. the zebrafish genome is ~ <dig>  gb in size and contains over  <dig>  million annotated transposons, with an average spacing of approximately  <dig> bp . we identified the longest segments of the zebrafish genome that lacked any recognizable transposons. we also repeated and updated our tfr analysis on the latest releases of the human, mouse and opossum genomes. all four genomes were analyzed for tfrs using the methodology described previously  <cit> . briefly, all regions larger than  <dig> kb free of any annotated transposons or genome assembly gaps were identified. we then excluded any regions that contained > 20% non-transposon repeat sequence, homology to the mitochondrial genome, or showed evidence of having undergone recent expansion .

examination of the zebrafish genome revealed a small number of loci containing tfrs that appear to be duplicated and often separated by a gap in the genome assembly. although many of these may represent true genomic duplications it is also possible that some may result from artifacts in the current draft genome assembly. we eliminated all potential duplicates by making pairwise alignments of all zebrafish tfrs and excluding one member of each pair from all further analysis .

we identified a final dataset of  <dig> zebrafish tfrs ≥  <dig> kb and  <dig>  tfrs ≥  <dig> kb, intermediate between the  <dig> opossum and  <dig> human tfrs ≥  <dig> kb . using a simple model of random transposon insertion, we calculated that the zebrafish genome would be expected to contain only six tfrs ≥  <dig> kb and  <dig>  tfrs ≥  <dig> kb . we estimate the probability of the observed  <dig> tfrs occurring by chance of is p < 10- <dig> and p < 10- <dig> for observing  <dig>  tfr ≥  <dig> kb.

all but one of the  <dig> longest zebrafish tfrs overlap a gene, ten of which encode transcription factors , and the human homologs of each of these transcription factor genes are also associated with tfrs ≥  <dig> kb. in addition to the transcription factor gene-associated tfrs, the remaining tfrs are also associated with a number of other regulatory genes, including those encoding the hedgehog receptor ptc <dig>  <cit>  and the oncogenic histone methyltransferase mll <dig>  <cit> .

a zebrafish genes are listed in lower case italic; human proteins mapped to corresponding loci in the zebrafish genome are given in upper case.

b the orthologous gene in human overlaps a tfr ≥  <dig> kb.

similar to that previously observed in mammals  <cit> , zebrafish tfrs are strongly associated with genes, 78% of tfrs ≥  <dig> kb  overlap a gene, although only 14%  of tfr bases are annotated as exonic. furthermore, when a tfr does overlap a gene, the tfr typically extends 5' of the transcription start site into the upstream intergenic region .

the majority of zebrafish tfrs have orthologous tfrs in mammals
we mapped zebrafish tfrs to syntenic regions of the human genome to examine whether the high level of orthology observed between the longest fish and human tfrs extended to smaller tfrs. each zebrafish tfr was mapped to a single locus in the human genome using the ucsc whole genome alignments to identify the best alignment covering the greatest number of bases in each tfr . the individual blocks within the selected alignment were then mapped to the human genome. we considered tfrs orthologous between zebrafish and human, mouse, or opossum, if any zebrafish tfr contained blocks of alignment within a human, mouse or opossum tfr.

we were able to identify orthologous human tfrs for 54% of zebrafish tfrs ≥  <dig> kb. the majority of these  have orthologs ≥  <dig> kb in human. similar numbers of orthologous tfrs were found in each of the mammalian species such that  <dig>  of tfrs ≥  <dig> kb have an ortholog ≥  <dig> kb and  <dig>  have an ortholog ≥  <dig> kb in one or more mammals . furthermore,  <dig>  zebrafish tfrs ≥  <dig> kb have an ortholog in human and  <dig>  have an ortholog in one or more mammals. the synteny between such a large number of fish and mammal tfrs is a clear indication that in many of these loci, tfrs have been maintained throughout vertebrate evolution.

small blocks of alignment that cover exons of protein coding genes anchor the majority of orthologous tfrs pairs. however, 16% of orthologous zebrafish tfrs ≥  <dig> kb do not contain exons of known genes in zebrafish nor align to exons in human. for example, the  <dig> kb tfr dr <dig>  and its human ortholog hs <dig>  lack any protein coding genes but the latter centers over the microrna locus mir-129- <dig>  . in another example, the  <dig>  kb and  <dig> kb zebrafish tfrs dr <dig>   and dr <dig>   are in the center of a  <dig> kb intergenic region, and the orthologous human tfrs, hsx. <dig>  and hsx. <dig> , are found in the center of a  <dig> kb gene desert. interestingly the border of both the human and zebrafish intergenic regions is adjacent to the zinc finger transcription factor gene zic <dig> 

while only  <dig> % of the non-transposon-derived portion of the zebrafish genome can be aligned to the human genome, 24% of bases within zebrafish tfrs with orthologous human tfrs ≥  <dig> kb are alignable , representing a  <dig>  fold enrichment. however, the remaining three quarters of tfr bases cannot be aligned to mammalian genomes and, thus it seems clear that conservation of primary sequence alone cannot explain the selection pressure against transposon insertion in these regions.

there is also evidence of lineage-specific tfrs. for example, the  <dig> kb zebrafish tfr dr <dig>  almost entirely spans the zfr gene, whereas there are no tfrs ≥  <dig> kb within or near the zfr orthologs in the human or mouse genomes. one quarter of zebrafish tfrs ≥  <dig> kb have no orthologous tfr in mammals.

no correlation in gc content between orthologous tfrs
in light of our previous observation that certain characteristics of mammalian tfrs may be related to the gc content of the tfr  <cit> , we compared the gc content of zebrafish and human tfrs. zebrafish tfrs have a gc content distribution ranging from 29% to 52% , in contrast to the very broad gc content distribution of human tfrs which ranges from 29% to 69% . there is no apparent correlation between the gc content of pairs of orthologous human and zebrafish tfrs , although human tfrs tend to have a higher gc content than their zebrafish ortholog. this is most dramatic in the 17% of orthologous pairs of tfrs where the absolute difference in gc percent is greater than  <dig> . for example, the orthologous tfrs dr <dig>   and hs <dig>  , both of which are greater than  <dig> kb long and extend over the 5' half of the t-box transcription factor gene tbx <dig> , have gc contents of 35% and 64%, respectively. the presence of such large differences in gc content and the lack of any correlation between gc content in orthologous pairs provides further evidence that tfr primary sequence may be under different selection pressures and/or rapid drift while maintaining their refraction to transposon insertions.

a core set of ancient tfrs is common to all vertebrate lineages
our analysis of the human, mouse, opossum and zebrafish genomes identified a core group of tfrs that are common to these four divergent vertebrate species. for example, the regions orthologous to the  <dig> kb zebrafish tfr dr <dig> , which overlaps the insulin-like growth factor ii mrna-binding protein  <dig>  gene, are also transposon-free in human, mouse, opossum and frog . sixty-four  zebrafish tfrs have orthologs ≥  <dig> kb in all three mammal species, and  <dig>  have orthologous tfrs ≥  <dig> kb. we identified a further  <dig>  zebrafish tfrs ≥  <dig> kb that also appear to have been maintained transposon-free since the last common ancestor of ray-finned fish and mammals.

although the current assembly of the frog  genome is not of sufficient quality to allow a full genome analysis of tfrs, we identified the orthologous regions of each of the  <dig> zebrafish tfrs ≥  <dig> kb that were also present in mouse, opossum, and human. in  <dig> of  <dig> cases we were able to identify orthologous regions of greater than  <dig> kb that contained no annotated transposons, although  <dig> contain one or more assembly gaps . four of the remaining  <dig> tfrs map to transposon-free regions of at least  <dig>  kb. this suggests that the majority of these ancient tfrs have been maintained transposon-free throughout the evolution of all major vertebrate lineages.

ancient tfrs are enriched for regulatory genes compared to lineage-specific tfrs
of the  <dig> human tfrs ≥  <dig> kb with orthologous tfrs in all species, 42% overlap a total of  <dig> genes annotated as "regulation of transcription", representing a  <dig>  fold enrichment . seventy percent of tfrs ≥  <dig> kb, overlap a total of  <dig> "regulation of transcription" genes, representing a  <dig>  fold enrichment . although genes annotated as "regulation of transcription" are over represented generally in all human tfrs ≥  <dig> kb, the level of enrichment  is half that observed for tfrs that have orthologs in all species. this strongly suggests that tfrs retained in multiple lineages are more likely to be associated with regulatory genes.

higher enrichment can be seen in the related but more specific annotation "transcription factor activity" that shows up to a  <dig>  fold enrichment  in tfrs ≥  <dig> kb with orthologs in all species. genes with an interpro annotated homeobox domain were also highly enriched in these ancient tfrs. a total of  <dig> of ancient tfrs ≥  <dig> kb overlap  <dig> genes containing a homeobox domain, yielding a  <dig> fold enrichment , and represents 22% of all homeobox genes in the human genome.

discussion
here we have described a large number of regions within the zebrafish genome that lack any annotated transposons, demonstrating that transposon-free regions are not restricted to mammals but are a common feature of vertebrate genomes.

furthermore, we have shown that many tfrs have been present since the dawn of the vertebrate lineage, and that these tfrs are significantly associated with developmental genes such as those encoding homeobox-containing proteins and transcription factors.

a potential problem when examining tfrs within any one lineage is that it can be difficult to distinguish short regions that have been selectively maintained transposon-free, as opposed to those that have a low transposon density by chance. however, we identified  <dig> zebrafish tfrs ≥  <dig> kb that have orthologous tfrs in all three mammalian species examined and  <dig>  that have an ortholog in at least one mammal. this provides strong evidence that a significant subset of shorter tfrs are also under functional constraint. furthermore, the increased enrichment of syntenically conserved tfrs associated with regulatory genes compared to lineage-specific tfrs suggests that it may be useful to separate these two classes of tfrs when assessing the potential functional importance of a tfr.

the vast majority  of zebrafish insertions are dna transposons , compared to the retrotransposons  that dominate the mammal genomes . as the majority of tfrs have been maintained at the same loci in both species through independent infestation of their genomes with these different classes of transposons we can conclude that tfrs are resistant to transposons of both major classes of transposable elements. in our previous analysis of mammalian tfrs we speculated that there are two general mechanisms by which these regions may be maintained: the underlying sequence may be resistant to transposon insertion, or transposon insertion in these regions may be deleterious and therefore subject to strong negative selection. as dna transposons and retrotransposons have substantially different mechanisms of transposition  <cit> , and given that much of the primary sequence of these regions has undergone significant change, it would seem unlikely that a molecular inhibition is in place that is capable of restricting insertion by such a wide range of mechanisms over such extended regions of sequence. this alternative is supported by the observation that in cancer-associated retroviral screens the integration of retroviruses, which occurs by a mechanism somewhat similar to retrotransposon integration  <cit> , appears to be uninhibited within tfrs  <cit> . given these results, we suggest that the existence of tfrs is more likely to be the result of strong evolutionary selection against the interruption of these regions by transposon-derived sequences, rather than a mechanism that precludes such insertions from occurring in the first place.

although tfrs are enriched for conserved dna, 75% of bases within zebrafish tfrs cannot be aligned, let alone show homology, to mammalian genomes, suggesting that primary sequence conservation alone cannot account for the presence of tfrs. moreover the dramatic changes in gc content  in orthologous pairs of tfrs suggest that some orthologous pairs have undergone different evolutionary histories that have reshaped the primary sequence composition of these regions either because of different selection pressures associated with phenotypic radiation and/or because of rapid drift. our analysis is consistent with the recent reports that regulatory function can be conserved between species without the requirement of primary sequence similarity  <cit> .

the maintenance of many tfrs throughout vertebrate evolution and their strong association with many key regulators of early development are a clear indication of the importance of tfrs in the genome. however, the molecular and genetic basis that prevents these extended regions from tolerating transposon sequence is still unclear. a recent analysis of chromatin domains in the mouse genome may suggest a biological explanation for at least some tfrs. bernstein et al  analyzed chromatin patterns in mouse embryonic stem  cells across  <dig> regions covering ~ <dig> % of the genome. they compared the distribution of histone h <dig> lys <dig>  methylation, typically associated with transcriptonally active chromatin, and histone h <dig> lys <dig>  methylation, typically associated with transcriptionally silent chromatin. a strong association was observed between lys <dig> chromatin domains and "transposon exclusion zones", which were defined using criteria similar to tfrs. in the regions analyzed,  <dig> of the  <dig>  lys <dig> chromatin domains identified contain at least one tfr ≥  <dig> kb, many of which also contained lys <dig> chromatin domains. these novel chromatin structures, occupied concurrently by both "repressive" lys <dig> and "activating" lys <dig> chromatin modifications were termed "bivalent domains" and are believed to maintain many developmentally important genes in a transcriptionally repressed state in es cells but poised for immediate activation when the correct developmental cues are received  <cit> .

as transposon-derived sequences are known to attract repressive epigenetic modifications  <cit>  it is possible to envisage a mechanism whereby insertion of transposon sequence in these chromatin domains attracts additional modifications and prevents the regulatory domain from functioning correctly. however, the association between transposon free regions and the chromatin domains examined was not observed in cells that have undergone differentiation  <cit> , suggesting an alternative model where the absence of repeats is itself an important marker for epigenetic reprogramming and establishes these complex chromatin domains during germ cell development and early embryogenesis  <cit> .

it must be noted that some bivalent domains exist in regions that contain substantial amounts of transposon sequence , and reciprocally, many tfrs do not coincide with any of the chromatin domains identified by this analysis. this demonstrates that our understanding of the relationship between these chromatin structures and tfrs is far from complete, and that the reasons for their occurrence are not entirely congruent. it would be interesting to directly compare the chromatin status across homologous zebrafish and mouse tfrs, particularly in those regions with high levels of primary sequence divergence.

CONCLUSIONS
we suggest that tfrs are distinct genomic signatures that may be useful for rapid prediction of important regulatory modules in vertebrate genomes. furthermore, our results suggest that the analysis of non-random patterns of different classes of sequences within genomes, in contrast to the traditional focus on primary sequence conservation, may offer new opportunities for the detection of functional elements within the genome.
