BACKGROUND
lipases  are esterases able to hydrolyze water-insoluble esters, which have a wide range of potential industrial applications  <cit> . pseudomonas lipases display special biochemical characteristics differing from those produced by other microorganisms  <cit> . the lipase lipb <dig> encoded by lipb <dig> , isolated from pseudomonas fluorescens b <dig>  displayed high level enantioselectivity with -tert-leucinate  <cit> . for industrial bioconversion processes, the utilization of surface-displayed lipase in the form of whole-cell biocatalysts is more advantageous, because the enzymes are displayed on the cell surface spontaneously, regarded as immobilized enzyme, and can be separated easily. with the recent development of cell-surface display technology, many active enzymes can be genetically immobilized on saccharomyces cerevisiae cell surface  <cit> , while displaying active enzymes on pichia pastoris cell surface was rarely reported <cit> . in fact, the p. pastoris expression system has gained acceptance as an important host organism <cit> , and is common for high level expression of foreign proteins.

in this paper, we have the lipase lipb <dig> displayed on pichia pastoris km <dig> cell surface with a pichia pastoris cell surface display system based on the flo gene encoding a lectin-like cell-wall protein  from saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . flo is composed of several domains: the secretion signal domain, the flocculation functional domain, the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol  anchor attachment signal domain and the membraneanchoring domain  <cit> . the flo flocculation functional domain, thought to be located near the n-terminus, recognizes and adheres noncovalently to cell-wall components such as α-mannan carbohydrates, causing reversible aggregation of cells into flocs  <cit> . the 5'-terminus of lipase gene lipb <dig> was fused to the 3'-terminus of the flo gene with the secretion signal sequence of flo or the α-factor secretion signal sequence, and the fused gene was transformed into a heterologous fungal host, pichia pastoris km <dig>  the lipase lipb <dig> was expressed under the control of the aox <dig> promoter and displayed on pichia pastoris km <dig> cell surface. localization of the expressed lipase lipb <dig> on the cell surface was confirmed by the confocal laser scanning microscopy . some biochemical characteristics of the lipase lipb <dig> displayed on pichia pastoris km <dig> cell surface were also analysed and compared with the lipb <dig> displayed on saccharomyces cerevisiae eby100-plhj <dig> cell surface.

RESULTS
construction of the recombinant plasmids of flo-lipb <dig> and expression of fusion proteins
the recombinant plasmids plhj <dig> and plhj <dig>  were constructed as described in methods. the flo sequence was cloned in the frame and downstream of the α-factor secretion signal sequence in plhj <dig>  while the secretion signal sequence in plhj <dig> was the one from flo.

the recombinant plasmids linearized with sal i were electroporated into pichia pastoris km <dig> as described in methods. the lipase gene was expressed under the control of the aox <dig> promoter and the displayed lipase activity were detected by bmmy medium plates supplemented with 1% olive oil and  <dig> % rhodamine b, the expression pattern can be determined by the fluorescent halo around them. the single transformant colony with lipase activity was inoculated and named as km71-plhj <dig> and km71-plhj <dig>  respectively. by using the total dna of km71-plhj <dig> and km71-plhj <dig> as the template, a dna fragment with the same size as lipase gene lipb <dig> was obtained with primers lipb52pf-ecor i and lipb52pr-not i by pcr amplification , which convinced that the km71-plhj <dig> and km71-plhj <dig> were recombinant pichia pastoris with lipase gene lipb <dig>  the lipase activity reached their maximum  after induced for  <dig> h, while the lipase lipb <dig> displayed on saccharomyces cerevisiae eby100-plhj <dig> reached its maximum  after induced for  <dig> h  and the cells were harvested for further analysis.

localization of the displayed lipase lipb52
immunofluorescent labeling of cells was performed as described in methods. the rabbit polyclonal anti-lipb <dig> antiserum was used as the primary antibody and the fitc-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin g was used as the secondary antibody. the green fluorescence outlining the immunostained lipb <dig> cells were clearly observed by the confocal laser scanning microscopy  on the recombinant km71-plhj <dig> and km71-plhj <dig>  the pichia pastoris km <dig> cells harboring the control plasmid ppic9k were not immunostained . the results confirmed that the lipb <dig> were displayed on the pichia pastoris km <dig> cell surface.

characterization and comparison of the displayed lipases
the p-nitrophenol ester with carbon chain length ranging from c <dig> to c <dig>  was used as the substrate to characterize the displayed lipase lipb <dig> produced by km71-plhj <dig> and km71-plhj <dig>  the lipase lipb <dig> displayed on pichia pastoris km <dig> cell surface exhibited evident hydrolysis activity towards the p-nitrophenol ester, but the optimum substrate was p-nitrophenol-caprate . lipase lipb <dig> displayed on pichia pastoris and saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibited similar substrate specificity . the lipase lipb <dig> displayed on pichia pastoris km71-plhj <dig> and km71-plhj <dig> cell surface have a temperature optimum of 40°c at ph <dig> . the hydrolysis activity reached  <dig> and  <dig> u/g dry cell respectively . the lipase lipb <dig> displayed on saccharomyces cerevisiae eby100-plhj <dig> cell surface had a temperature optimum of 37°c at ph <dig> , its maximum activity was  <dig> u/g dry cell. the lipase lipb <dig> displayed on pichia pastoris km71-plhj <dig> and km71-plhj <dig> cell surface retained over 90% activity after incubation at 60°c for  <dig> hours at ph  <dig> , and they can still retained about 80% activity after incubation for  <dig> hours. they exhibited better stability than the lipase lipb <dig> displayed on saccharomyces cerevisiae eby100-plhj <dig> cell surface . the transesterification activity of the displayed lipases had no evident difference .

discussion
many reports indicated that the active site of pseudomonas lipase was located at the c-terminal region  <cit> , the lipase displayed on saccharomyces cerevisiae cell surface by its c- terminus was fused to the cell-wall-anchored protein, α-agglutinin, exhibited no activity towards olive oil and a very low enzymatic activity towards p-nitrophenol butyrate  <cit> . the flo protein is thought to produce cell adhesion via noncovalent interaction of its flocculation functional domain with the mannan chain of the cell wall. its c-terminus was used to fuse with the n-terminus of target protein, it was successfully used to display active lipase based on saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . considering the similarity between the cell walls of saccharomyces cerevisiae and pichia pastoris and the adhesive ability of the flo protein, we attempted to utilize the relevant domain in a surface display system based on pichia pastoris.

we successfully developed a pichia pastoris surface display system utilizing flocculation functional domain of flo protein, and had the lipase lipb <dig> expressed and displayed on pichia pastoris km <dig> cell surface. in the present study, two recombinant plasmids  with the same components except the secretion signal sequences were constructed. the secretion signal sequence in plhj <dig> is the α-factor secretion signal sequence, while the secretion signal sequence in plhj <dig> is the one from flo. as shown in the results, the signal sequence of flo exhibits similar effect to α-factor signal sequence in pichia pastoris. this pichia pastoris surface display system is also expected to be effective for n-terminal immobilization of target proteins whose catalytic site is near its c-terminus.

the lipase lipb <dig> displayed on pichia pastoris km <dig> cell surface exhibited some similar biochemical characteristics to that displayed on saccharomyces cerevisiae eby100-plhj <dig> cell surface, but better stability. as shown in tab.  <dig>  the lipase gene was integrated into the genome when displayed on pichia pastoris cell surface, it could be expressed steadily and can be fermented by using complete medium. however, the lipase gene was cloned in the episomal plasmid when displayed on saccharomyces cerevisiae cell surface, it must be fermented by using minimal medium. although the pichia pastoris induction time was longer than saccharomyces cerevisiae, the pichia pastoris dry cell weight per liter  ferment culture was about  <dig> times than saccharomyces cerevisiae. further more the galactose used as the inducer for expressing lipase in saccharomyces cerevisiae was more costly than the methanol used in pichia pastoris. all these implied that the lipase displayed on pichia pastoris cell surface is more suitable for being used as whole-cell biocatalysts than that displayed on saccharomyces cerevisiae cell surface.

CONCLUSIONS
a pichia pastoris surface display system utilizing flocculation functional domain of flo protein was developed, and the activity lipase lipb <dig> was expressed and displayed on pichia pastoris km <dig> cell surface. the lipase displayed on pichia pastoris cell surface was more suitable for being used as whole-cell biocatalysts than that displayed on saccharomyces cerevisiae cell surface.
