BACKGROUND
acoels are marine, soft-bodied, unsegmented worms without hindgut and anus - the mouth opens to a central digestive parenchyma, a gut lumen is absent. acoels move with their multiciliated epidermis although many are 'surprisingly muscular'  <cit> . most of the species are free-living, some are ectocommensals. several species from the subtaxa sagittiferidae and convolutidae form obligate symbioses with green algae  <cit> , making them functional photoautotroph organisms. in traditional systematics the acoela were considered to be representatives of the platyhelminthes, due to their 'flatworm-like' features such as the ciliated epidermis, the frontal organ, neoblasts, hermaphroditic reproduction, biflagellate sperm, and a lack of body cavities , hindgut and anus  <cit> . based on the ultrastructural characteristics of cilia, and the hypothesized reduction of gut and protonephridia, ehlers  combined acoela with nemertodermatida to form the acoelomorpha. in his system the catenulida form the sister group to all other platyhelminthes , which comprise the sister groups acoelomorpha and rhabditophora. however, the monophyly of the platyhelminthes was soon questioned because of the weakness of these morphological characters  <cit> . subsequent ultrastructural studies have demonstrated numerous differences between acoelomorpha and platyhelminthes, particularly amongst characters once thought to be homologous. for example, frontal organ morphology  <cit> , sperm ultrastructure  <cit> , and patterns in the nervous and muscular systems  <cit>  all demonstrate the uniqueness of acoelomorphs.

early molecular systematic studies using ribosomal rna genes strongly suggested that acoela and nemertodermatida were distinctly separate from the platyhelminthes  <cit> ; this result remains coherent even in the light of more taxa, more sequence data and more sophisticated models of phylogenetic analysis  <cit> . in the last  <dig> years several phylogenetic studies with molecular sequences have suggested a phylogenetic position of acoels as sister group to all other bilateria  <cit> . studies with broad taxon sampling of both acoela and nemertodermatida supported paraphyly of acoelomorpha, with acoela forming the sister group to the remaining bilateria   <cit> . presuming a position as sister group to all other bilateria and considering the comparably simple body organisation, the morphological features of acoels may provide insights concerning the bodyplan of the 'last common bilaterian ancestor'  <cit> , the ancestor of extant acoels, protostomes and deuterostomes  <cit> . thus, acoels came into the focus of studies in evolutionary developmental biology as a possible window into the deep past of bilaterians  <cit> .

in spite of these advances there is still controversy about the phylogenetic position of acoela, and at the same time nemertodermatida. despite overwhelming molecular evidence against a platyhelminth affinity, some authors discuss the stem cell system of acoela and rhabditophora as a potential synapomorphy of these taxa  <cit> . however, data about stem cells from other invertebrate taxa are very sparse, so this character is in need of a broad comparative study. recent phylogenomic studies do not recover platyhelminth affinities for acoela, but show quite different results due to the varying amount of genes and taxa covered. a phylogenomic analysis of est data from isodiametra pulchra  <cit>  found no relevant nodal support for any sister group relation. however, the best tree from this analysis clustered i. pulchra together with the deuterostomes. another est study, including the acoel species neochildia fusca and s. roscoffensis also failed to support any convincing relationship with another metazoan phylum or lineage  <cit> . thus, the authors omitted acoels from subsequent analyses due to their low leaf stability. finally, a recent increase in taxon sampling incorporated in the latter study, with additional sampling of acoels and including nemertodermatids, supported acoelomorpha  as a monophylum with bootstrap support of 70% and 90% in two datasets of different sizes  <cit> . acoelomorpha were the sister group to xenoturbella in that study, but with only moderate bootstrap support from one of the two analysed datasets. xenoturbella and acoelomorpha together formed the sister group to all other bilateria , once again with merely moderate nodal support.

to evaluate the phylogenetic position of acoels using an independent set of molecular data we present the first complete sequence of a mitochondrial genome of a member of the acoela, symsagittifera roscoffensis . we describe gene content and trna secondary structure, compare the mitochondrial gene order to other taxa and show the results of a phylogenetic analysis with sequence alignments from mitochondrial protein-coding genes.

RESULTS
organisation of the genome and genes
the circular, double-stranded mitochondrial genome of s. roscoffensis consists of  <dig> bp . it contains two rrna- and twelve protein-coding genes. the gene for atp <dig>  which is normally also present in bilaterian mt genomes, is missing. this gene is also absent in the mitochondrial genomes of platyhelminthes, chaetognatha and almost all nematodes . thus there seems to be a tendency to lose atp <dig> in several unrelated taxa. we identified  <dig> trna genes and determined their putative secondary structures . despite a careful software search and inspection by eye, no sequence resembling the genes for trnl <dig> and trnl <dig> could be detected except within other genes. two candidate positions for trnl <dig> and trnl <dig> are in nad <dig>  and in rrnl , respectively . amongst the trna genes, one loop of the typical cloverleaf structure is absent in some cases: trns <dig> and trnd lack the dhu-stem. a missing dhu- stem in trns <dig> is typical for all parasitic flatworms and many other metazoa  <cit> . the tÏˆc-stem is missing in trna, -h, -i, -m, -t, -e and -y. the majority of the trna genes show either mismatches of one to several nucleotides and/or shortened stems and enlarged loops, respectively . mitochondrial genes are transcribed from both strands, with cox1- <dig>  atp <dig>  lrrna, srrna, nad <dig> and nad <dig>  as well as trnt, -f, -y, -v, -n, -h, -e, -k, -a, -r, -g, -s <dig>  -s <dig> and -m being transcribed from the plus-strand, the remaining ones from the minus-strand. thirty, mostly short, non-coding regions can be found, ranging from one to  <dig> bp in length. none of these regions is significantly more at-rich compared to the complete genome. thus, a putative control region  <cit>  could not easily be determined at first sight. the entire genome has a high a+t content of  <dig> % and overall nucleotide frequencies of  <dig> % a,  <dig> % t,  <dig> % g and  <dig> % c. at-skew - and gc-skew   <cit>  of the whole plus-strand sequence are both close to zero , so there is no conspicuous strand-asymmetry in nucleotide frequency as in many other metazoan mt genomes  <cit> . high a+t content is a typical feature of nuclear ribosomal genes of acoela, and it has been suggested a possible factor affecting phylogenetic resolution of these worms amongst the metazoa  <cit> , similarly to the acoels' highly truncated and modified rrna genes.

the whole molecule consists of  <dig> nt; exact gene loci and the number of intergenic base pairs are depicted.

overlaps between genes were not detected, except for the remaining possibility that trnl <dig> and trnl <dig> are positioned within nad <dig> and rrnl, respectively. all protein genes terminate with the codon taa, except for cox <dig> ending with tag. existing start codons are more variable: att is found in cytb, nad <dig>  cox <dig> and cox3; nad <dig> and nad <dig> start with atg; atp <dig> begins with ata and nad <dig> with atc. only cox <dig> with ggt and nad <dig> with cat are exceptions from the commonly used start codons in mitochondrial genomes. another uncommon feature is a repeat region of  <dig> bp found in nad <dig> .

gene order
the gene order found in s. roscoffensis shows no clear similarity with any other mitochondrial gene order published to date. fig.  <dig> shows a comparison between s. roscoffensis, paratomella rubra, nemertoderma westbladi and microstomum lineare  <cit> , fasciola hepatica  <cit> , xenoturbella bocki  <cit> , and the putative bilaterian ground pattern  <cit> . even the partial genome of p. rubra  <cit> , another member of the acoela, differs completely from our data. both organisms share merely the fact that rrns and rrnl are not adjacent, but separated by one  and four  protein-encoding genes, respectively. this feature was also found in the nemertodermatid species nemertoderma westbladi  <cit> . the ancestral state is supposed to be a separation only by trnv  <cit> , a feature found in many metazoan mitochondrial genomes. conserved gene blocks, which are shared with other taxa, could not be identified in s. roscoffensis. in addition to visual comparison of genome maps, we analyzed gene order data with crex  <cit> , determining the number of common intervals. this means the number of "blocks" with the same set of genes, regardless of their order inside a "block". we compared only gene orders of protein-coding and ribosomal rna genes, as trnas are known to be subject to more frequent gene translocation than the larger genes. the result  shows overall low numbers of common intervals for comparison of s. roscoffensis with any of the other gene orders . however, although not significant, the highest numbers  are obtained in comparison with the putative deuterostome ground pattern and with xenoturbella bocki , while the lowest number was obtained in comparisons to platyhelminth gene orders . we also determined breakpoint distances between these taxa, but these results were even less meaningful for s. roscoffensis .

phylogenetic analysis
initial maximum likelihood  and bayesian inference  analyses with evolutionary models using site-homogenous substitution matrices derived from mitochondrial amino acid alignments , yielded poor resolution of the phylogenetic position of acoels. it is well known that analyses of mitochondrial amino acid alignments on higher taxonomic levels suffer from two major problems:  the taxa may strongly vary in amino acid composition, which hampers the usefulness of a fixed substitution matrix, and  accelerated substitution rates in some fast-evolving taxa, leading to long-branch attraction artifacts. a few recent approaches aim to handle these problems more appropriately. in large datasets the empirical site-heterogeneous cat mixture model  <cit>  is superior to all site-homogenous amino acid matrix models in avoiding long-branch attraction  <cit> . in addition, changes in model parameters for parts of the tree will be applied empirically using the "breakpoint"  approach in combination with the cat model  <cit> . a recent study demonstrated the usefulness of the cat-bp model by placing the long-branching tunicata together with acrania and vertebrata as chordata, while other model settings were not successful in this respect  <cit> . we set up a dataset of  <dig> species, including representative members of all phyla, among them long-branching taxa like platyhelminthes and nematoda. we ran four mcmc chains with nh-phylobayes and the cat-bp option. two chains converged with each other twice, each favoring different topologies with respect to acoels. in both variants acoela and nemertodermatida were supported as sister groups, with significant support values . the first topology, recovered from two out of four independent chains  shows significant support  for acoela and nemertodermatida forming the sister group to all other bilateria . ecdysozoa excluding nematodes  as well as lophotrochozoa + nematoda + chaetognatha  and deuterostomia + xenoturbella  are significantly supported.

the other topology, with small differences represented in the two other chains, found no resolution at the base of bilateria . instead there is a polytomy of five taxa: xenoturbella, acoela + nemertodermatida, ambulacraria, chordata and the protostomes. in the best tree xenoturbella clusters with acoela + nemertodermatida, but there is no significant support for this group .

due to these findings and the preliminary analyses we suspected that it was predominantly xenoturbella which had an unstable position in the phylogenetic trees. therefore we conducted additional analyses with a dataset without xenoturbella, and a second analysis without acoela and nemertodermatida. in both variants four independent chains were run. in all four chains with xenoturbella omitted, acoela and nemertodermatida form a monophylum which is the sister group to the remaining bilateria . in the analysis without acoela and nemertodermatida, xenoturbella was found either as sister to deuterostomia  or as sister to ambulacraria . thus, in the absence of acoels xenoturbella has a more unstable position in the bilaterian tree than acoels have in the absence of xenoturbella. acoels remain a critically important taxon to place within the metazoa.

CONCLUSIONS
concluding discussion
mitochondrial gene order of the complete mitochondrial genome of the acoel s. roscoffensis is highly divergent from that of other bilaterian animals, including the partial mitochondrial genome of paratomella rubra. even computational approaches of gene order comparison like minimal breakpoint analysis and common interval analysis did not favour any affinity of s. roscoffensis to another taxon. phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial amino acid sequences give support for acoels forming a clade with nemertodermatids. but the limited available dataset representing the nemertodermatida gives this result a rather preliminary nature. the dataset of nemertoderma westbladi is incomplete as it consists of sequences from only three complete and two partial genes, thus covering only  <dig> % of the final alignment. for a better evaluation of monophyly versus paraphyly of acoelomorpha we are in need of more complete mitochondrial genome sequences from nemertodermatida and acoela.

altogether we see more evidence for a position of acoela and nemertodermatida branching off early from the bilaterian tree rather than being grouped with deuterostomes or protostomes. the position of xenoturbella cannot be fixed with this dataset, but its affinity to deuterostomes is greater than to acoela and/or nemertoderma.

our trees also demonstrate limitations of the cat-bp model with the bilaterian mitochondrial protein dataset. nematoda are still clustering with the similarly long-branched platyhelminthes and syndermata, instead of forming a monophylum with other ecdysozoans . almost all other molecular datasets support ecdyszoa , so this must be an artifact probably due to selection. a similar problem is described from snakes, where selection seems to act on mitochondrial protein-complexes under special physiological conditions  <cit> . the long branches in the bilaterian tree are found in both parasitic and in free-living species of nematodes and platyhelminths. thus, a parasitic life style does not seem to contribute to this accelerated evolutionary change.

if acoela and nemertodermatida represent ancient clades which split off early from the bilaterian tree, while xenoturbella splits off later than these two, probably as sister group of the deuterostomes  <cit> , then we can easily interpret morphological features shared by both as plesiomorphic character states, shared with the last common ancestor of bilateria. as telford  <cit>  noted, acoela and xenoturbella share the following features: an acoelomate bodyplan with ventral mouth and absence of anus  <cit> ; a unique tapering shelf at the ciliary tip and other similarities in the ciliary rootlets  <cit> ; the nervous system is non-centralized and intra-epidermal in some acoela and in xenoturbella  <cit> . recently, nielsen  <cit>  pointed out that the genomes of xenoturbella and acoels have a significantly reduced hox gene complement  <cit> . the more complex set of hox genes in the remaining bilaterians would be a valuable apomorphic character supporting nephrozoa excl. xenoturbella, a topology as in fig.  <dig> .

but this plesiomorphic feature cannot support a relationship between xenoturbella and acoels. if xenoturbella is part of the deuterostomes , the hox complement of xenoturbella must be secondarily reduced, as there are many similarities in the hox complement of the remaining deuterostome and protostome taxa. nuclear genome data of the complete hox clusters seem to be indispensible for a comprehensive evaluation of the evolution of hox genes at the base of bilateria.

with regard to comparative analysis of mitochondrial genomes, especially gene order, more data are definitely needed, e.g. complete mitochondrial genome sequences from more than one acoel species, since the comparison of s. roscoffensis and p. rubra has shown that gene order in acoels seem to differ radically. thus, single "representative" species are by no means sufficient to characterise or represent taxa  <cit> . similarly, nemertodermatid genomes also require further and exhaustive evaluations. there is still no complete mitochondrial sequence of this group available, preventing meaningful, genome-based phylogenetic analyses.
