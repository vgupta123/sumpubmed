BACKGROUND
understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling somatic embryogenesis is crucial, be it biologically or for applications. indeed, propagating cultivated plants by somatic embryogenesis still remains limited by the efficiency of the procedures in some recalcitrant species or genotypes. genetic predeterminism of recalcitrance in some woody and herbaceous perennial species has been linked to their response to wounding and their phenolic compound content  <cit> . the production of ethylene, carbon dioxide and free radicals lies behind the induction of cell defence mechanisms, leading to the oxidation of phenol compounds, the breakdown of cell walls and membrane peroxidation  <cit> . adding growth regulators, and the stress induced by in vitro culture, play a leading role in such mechanisms  <cit> . these phenomena result in the differentiation of undifferentiated cells and in tissue browning, which lead to a loss in embryogenic capacity  <cit> .

the negative effect of ethylene on somatic embryogenesis has been known for a long time  <cit> . some super-embryogenic explant cultures of medicago truncatula revealed the repression of numerous genes, including those involved in ethylene biosynthesis and signalling  <cit> . in alfalfa, loss of embryogenic capacity following thidiazuron application is linked to the induction of an ethylene biosynthesis gene  <cit> . ethylene also induces some stress factors conducive to the acquisition of somatic embryogenesis capacities  <cit> , and embryo maturation  <cit> . abscisic acid and methyl jasmonate are regulators of ethylene biosynthesis during somatic embryogenesis in medicago sativa <cit> . some members of the ethylene response factor  family are involved in response to in vitro stress and in the regulation of developmental processes. in medicago truncatula, the somatic embryo related factor  <dig> gene  is induced by ethylene and may act under the influence of wuschel , whose fixation sites are found on the serf <dig> gene promoter  <cit> . enhancer of shoot regeneration <dig>  of arabidopsis is induced by cytokinins to regulate the start of shoot regeneration  <cit> . dornroschen /esr <dig> plays a role in meristem and organ development and consequently in shoot regeneration  <cit> . esr <dig> expression confers “cytokinin-independent shoot regeneration” through transcriptional regulation of the cup-shaped cotyledon  <dig> gene   <cit> . when interacting with other transcription factors, the induction of callus expressing factor <dig>  through stress would appear to disrupt auxin/cytokinin homeostasis in nicotiana tabacum. of the numerous other transcription factors involved in embryogenesis and organ development , several members of the apetala <dig> family  play a major role  <cit> . like erfs, this family belongs to the ap2/erf superfamily. for example, baby boom  is known for its role in cell proliferation and morphogenesis during embryogenesis  <cit> . aintegumenta  is involved in ovule development and in the growth of floral organs  <cit> . wrinkled  is involved in regulating storage metabolism in seeds  <cit> . the ant subfamily includes several members called ant-like genes or ails. the initiation of post-embryonic shoot organs takes place in the shoot apical meristem, also involving several members of the ap <dig> family   <cit> .

hevea brasiliensis is a particularly difficult species which has led to numerous micropropagation studies  <cit> . this cross-fertilizing species is cloned by budding in the absence of any other efficient vegetative propagation techniques for own-rooted plants. two somatic embryogenesis methods have been developed for hevea . the first is somatic embryogenesis on primary callus  obtained from fragments of the internal integument of immature seeds or anthers  <cit> . this method is effective for around twenty hevea clones following numerous culture medium and atmosphere studies  <cit> . however, primary calli are subject to browning due to high ethylene and carbon dioxide release, which leads to a low callus multiplication rate  <cit> . in vitro plantlets produced by sep are usually of good quality with better growth and latex production than budded clones  <cit> . a second method was developed from friable callus maintained over the long term with a view to large-scale multiplication. this method has evolved with the use of fragments of embryos derived from sep in order to rapidly establish embryogenic friable callus lines  <cit> . lastly, cryopreservation of friable calli has been incorporated into the process to limit tissue proliferation and, thereby, the risks linked to somaclonal variation  <cit> . however, this indirect secondary somatic embryogenesis process is restricted to just a few clones and the embryo and plant regeneration capacity is variable. the absence of plant regeneration potential in some friable callus lines has been linked to early vacuolization of cells in the embryogenic globules  <cit> . some transcriptional changes have also been reported for certain hevea callus lines with different embryogenic potentials  <cit> .

a study on the role of ethylene in stimulating latex production led to the characterization of ethylene biosynthesis and signalling genes and more recently to the identification of the different members of the ap2/erf superfamily  <cit> . the ap2/erf superfamily contains  <dig> members, of which  <dig> are classed in families and groups  <cit> . the ap <dig> family contains  <dig> genes organized in two subfamilies . the erf family is divided into  <dig> groups comprising a total of  <dig> genes. lastly, there remains the rav family with four genes and the soloists with  <dig> genes. based on this knowledge, our study set out to gain a clearer understanding of the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis and signalling genes, including erfs, along with the members of the ap <dig> and rav families during the somatic embryogenesis process in hevea. the relative transcript abundance analysis for these genes was carried out by real-time rt-pcr on friable callus lines with different embryogenic potential  <cit> , on normal and abnormal somatic embryos, and on different young plant tissues. the gene expression profiles showed that several genes were markers of embryogenic potential for the lines in proliferating calli and in calli induced by embryogenesis, and also markers of somatic embryo quality. prediction of the function of those marker genes provides a dynamic understanding of the somatic embryogenesis process.

RESULTS
morphogenetic potential of callus lines with different somatic embryogenesis capacities
the secondary indirect somatic embryogenesis process is described in figure  <dig> . primary somatic embryogenesis is induced from inner integument of immature seed as maternal tissue . compact callus-bearing mature somatic embryos were obtained after three subcultures . friable callus lines were established from fragments of somatic embryo. the proliferating friable calli grown on the ent medium were fairly comparable whatever their embryogenic capacity . after four weeks’ culture on exp, the calli of the non-embryogenic  and embryogenic  lines were more hydric and whitish than those of the regenerant line . callus growth was slowed during embryo regeneration in the rita culture system on dev medium. the calli turned brown in all the lines . browning occurred to the benefit of embryo formation for embryogenic lines . the normal embryos had an embryonic body and two well-developed cotyledons . the abnormal types of embryos were most numerous: for example, some embryos with a single cotyledon , or with malformed cotyledons , and a double embryonic body  were found. plantlets derived from normal embryos developed a taproot and a lateral root system, and a stem with leaves within a month .

the morphogenetic capacities of three friable callus lines were tested up to somatic embryo conversion into plantlets . the non-embryogenic line ci <dig>  did not produce any somatic embryos. line ci <dig>  called embryogenic , produced  <dig>  somatic embryos per gram of callus, most of which were abnormal . only the regenerant line ci <dig>  produced a large number of total somatic embryos . the proportion of abnormal embryos was very high for the embryogenic and regenerant lines, at  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. out of  <dig> normal embryos derived from the regenerant line transferred to germination medium,  <dig> developed into plantlets.

the non-embryogenic line  cannot regenerate any embryos, the embryogenic line  can only produce a few embryos but cannot regenerate any plantlets, and the regenerant line  can produce a large number of embryos and regenerate plantlets.

identification of  <dig> marker genes of somatic embryogenesis capacities during callus proliferation
the relative transcript abundance for ethylene biosynthesis and signalling genes, and for the ap <dig> and rav families, was analysed in proliferating calli on ent medium . some high levels were found for several genes in each family of genes, except for the ravs . the erfs from groups i, vii and viii amounted to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes respectively with levels over  <dig> in relative value compared to the transcript abundance of the internal control rh2b. the comparison between lines with different embryogenic potential revealed that  <dig> genes were differentially expressed . the relative transcript abundance was lower in the calli of the r line than in the e and ne lines for  <dig> genes, of which three were involved in ethylene biosynthesis and perception , four were from the erf family , and  <dig> were from the ap <dig> family . the transcripts of the hbap2- <dig> gene were greatly accumulated in the embryogenic line. lastly, the transcripts of the hberf-viia <dig> gene were less abundant in the non-embryogenic line, while, conversely, those of the hbrav- <dig> gene were accumulated more in the calli of that line.

identification of  <dig> marker genes of somatic embryogenesis capacities during somatic embryogenesis expression/induction
the calli transferred to a somatic embryogenesis induction medium also strongly expressed a large number of the genes studied for virtually all the families and groups, except for the erf-v group . as previously, most of the members of groups i , vii  and viii  of the erf family had a high transcript level. the differential expression between calli of the different lines was significant for  <dig> genes . of those genes,  <dig> had higher transcript accumulation in the regenerant line than in the ne and e lines:  <dig> ethylene biosynthesis gene ,  <dig> genes of the erf family ,  <dig> genes of the ap <dig> family  and  <dig> gene of the rav family . transcripts of the hberf-viiia <dig> gene were accumulated in the calli of the embryogenic line compared to the other two lines. lastly,  <dig> genes comprising  <dig> erfs  and  <dig> ap2s  had a lower transcript level in the non-embryogenic line than in the others.

sixteen genes were differentially expressed in normal and abnormal somatic embryos
the normal and abnormal somatic embryos produced by the regenerant line revealed a differential expression profile solely for certain members of the erf family . the gene transcripts belonging to each of the families and groups were highly accumulated, except for the rav family . most of the members of the erf-i, erf-vii and erf-viii groups were highly expressed in the two types of embryos. the transcript abundance was lower in the normal embryos than in the abnormal embryos for  <dig> genes belonging to the erf family  . conversely, the transcripts of  <dig> genes were accumulated in the normal embryos .

evolution of transcript abundance during the process of somatic embryogenesis and conversion into plantlets
an overall analysis of the somatic embryogenesis process for the regenerant line using proliferating callus up to the conversion of normal embryos into plantlets showed that the expression of numerous genes was highly modulated . the transcripts of numerous ethylene biosynthesis and transduction genes, and some erfs from groups i, vii and viii and of the ap <dig> family, were highly accumulated . thirty-six genes from all the families or groups revealed differential accumulation during the embryogenesis process, except for the erfs from group x . several gene expression profiles were observed. eleven markers were activated right from the somatic embryogenesis induction phase . the transcripts of eight genes  were very abundant in embryogenic tissues, whereas they were significantly less abundant in the tissues of the plantlet. a transient accumulation was seen for two genes  in calli induced in embryogenesis on exp medium, for six genes  in somatic embryos and for two genes  in both calli on exp medium and in embryos. the transcripts of three genes  were preferentially accumulated in leaves and, in the case of hberf-ixc <dig>  in both somatic embryos and leaves. lastly, the relative transcript abundance was high in all tissues except in embryos, where it decreased significantly for the hbap2- <dig> gene, and except in calli, embryos and roots for hbrav <dig> 

identification of putative functions for somatic embryogenesis marker genes
of the fifty-six genes differentially expressed during the somatic embryogenesis process, forty were regulated in the same way when the regenerant line was compared with the other two non-embryogenic or embryogenic lines, and when the normal embryos were compared with the abnormal embryos . the ratios between the relative transcript abundance of the regenerant line and the other two lines showed that the markers tended to be under-expressed in the proliferating calli of the regenerant line  and over-expressed in the calli induced in embryogenesis on exp medium . of the sixteen embryo expression markers, twelve were under-expressed and four were over-expressed.

the ratios between the relative transcript abundance of the regenerant and non-embryogenic lines , the regenerant and embryogenic lines , of the normal and abnormal embryos  are presented for only significant down-regulated genes  and up-regulated .

the role of these gene expression markers was first predicted by a reciprocal best hit analysis  of the transcript sequences . roles were mostly found in the response to biotic and abiotic stress, and more precisely in tolerance of dehydration, salinity and cold. the genes of the ap <dig> and rav families, along with a small proportion of erfs, played a role in developmental processes . in order to find hevea potential orthologs to arabidopsis genes functionally described in the literature, the deduced amino acid sequences of the ap <dig> domain were analysed for the ap <dig> family and the different erf groups  making up the marker genes in hevea . the summary of the phylogenetic tree analyses can be found in table  <dig>  thirteen of the hevea marker genes proved to be potential orthologs of sixteen arabidopsis genes including some co-orthologs: hberf-ia <dig> with erf <dig>  hberf-iiic <dig> with atcbf/dreb , hberf-iiie <dig> with tiny, hberf-iva <dig> and hberf-iva <dig> with dreb2a, hberf-vi <dig> and hberf-vi <dig> with crf2/tmo <dig>  hberf-xb <dig> with rrtf <dig>  hbap2- <dig> with bbm, hbap2- <dig> with two aintegumenta-like genes , hbap2- <dig> with aintegumenta, and hbap2- <dig> and hbap <dig> with apetala <dig> 

discussion
factors contributing to the loss of embryogenic capacity
although callus browning occurs late during embryo development in the normal process, early browning in proliferating calli contributes to a loss of their embryogenic capacity by promoting the differentiation of active cells   <cit> . in hevea, such browning has been linked to a strong accumulation of oxidized polyphenols in cells and to ethylene production  <cit> . this study corroborates those findings with the activation of ethylene biosynthesis and signalling genes in proliferating calli of low embryogenic or non-embryogenic lines , whereas this only occurred after induction in embryogenesis on exp medium for the regenerant line. the gene expression markers of plant regeneration capacity found in proliferating calli belonged to groups vi, vii and viii of the erfs , which are factors of response to hormonal signals . other factors generally linked to development were also activated in proliferating calli from the embryogenic or non-embryogenic lines. four genes from the ap <dig> family can be noted: hbap2- <dig>  hbap2- <dig>  hbap2- <dig>  hbap2- <dig>  the phylogenetic analysis between the hevea and arabidopsis families led to the prediction of several orthologs. hbap2- <dig> and hbap2-12/hbap2- <dig> were found to be potential orthologs of arabidopsis bbm and ap <dig> genes, respectively  <cit> . bbm is preferentially expressed in developing embryos and seeds  <cit> . its ectopic expression in arabidopsis, brassica and nicotiana has led to the spontaneous formation of somatic embryos and cotyledon-like structures in seedlings  <cit> . however, such ectopic expression gives rise to pleiotropic phenotypes such as neoplastic growth, regeneration of plants on a hormone-free medium, and an alteration of leaf and flower morphology. the role of bbm in promoting cell proliferation and morphogenesis during embryogenesis seems to be confirmed for other species such as brassica napus and elaeis guineensis <cit> . the ap <dig> gene is involved in the control of arabidopsis flower and seed development  <cit> . this gene is known to be expressed in non-floral organs, such as leaves and stems, and may play a general role in controlling arabidopsis development. nevertheless, early activation of these genes, especially hbap2- <dig> and hbap2- <dig>  in proliferating hevea callus might be not appropriate since it is not conducive to further induction of somatic embryogenesis.

change occurring during somatic embryogenesis induction
somatic embryogenesis is triggered by reducing the concentration of growth regulators in the culture medium of hevea calli. this helps to slow down callus growth to the benefit of embryo formation  <cit> . embryogenesis induction is also accompanied by callus browning. in this study, that transition was linked to changes in gene expression. several ethylene biosynthesis genes, such as hbacs <dig> and hbaco <dig>  were highly transcribed in the calli before and after embryogenesis induction. when calli were transferred to the exp medium, transcripts of the sams gene accumulated dramatically. that gene is also a marker that differentiated between the regenerant line and the other two low- or non-embryogenic lines, be it for the callus proliferation phase or during somatic embryogenesis induction. sams catalyses the formation of s-adenosyl methionine, which is a substrate for the ethylene and polyamine biosynthesis pathways. the latter would seem to play a decisive role in the somatic embryogenesis of hevea <cit> . however, the induction of several erfs indicates the establishment of ethylene signalling. four erfs  and the hbrav <dig> gene were transiently induced in calli on the exp culture medium for somatic embryogenesis induction . at that stage of the process, the comparison between the regenerant line and the low- or non-embryogenic lines also revealed strong induction of  <dig> erfs ,  <dig> ap <dig>  and the rav <dig> gene .

several of these gene expression markers were predicted to be orthologs of arabidopsis genes with characterized functions. hberf-iiic <dig> is orthologous to several arabidopsis dreb1s from group  <dig> induced by cold  <cit> . hberf-iiie <dig> is the putative ortholog of tiny known to be activated by drought, cold, ethylene and, to a lesser degree, methyl jasmonate  <cit> . the semi-dominant tiny mutation causes a reduction in plant height, and affects hypocotyl elongation and fertility. tiny might play a role in communication between biotic and abiotic stress signalling pathways. hberf-iva <dig> and hberf-iva <dig> are two potential orthologs of dreb2a involved in drought-responsive gene expression  <cit> . hberf-iva <dig> was transitionally induced in calli placed on somatic embryogenesis induction medium, and both hberf-iva <dig> and hberf-iva <dig> were good markers of the regeneration potential compared with the low-embryogenic or non-embryogenic line. these two genes could therefore be very good gene expression markers but would also seem to play a key role in the somatic embryogenesis process. the transcripts of hberf-vi <dig> were accumulated in the normal embryos while hberf-vi <dig> showed under-expression in the proliferating calli of the regenerant line. these genes are putative orthologs to crf <dig>  which has been previously described as target of mp <dig> . the tmo gene is targeted by the auxin-dependent transcription factor monopteros , which is a regulatory signal in embryonic root specification  <cit> . ap <dig> genes are generally transcribed in multiple tissues during development. ails also play a role in the specification of meristematic or division-competent states  <cit> . hbap2- <dig> is the putative ortholog of two arabidopsis genes, ail7/plt <dig> <cit>  and ail6/plt <dig>  involved in floral meristem growth  <cit> . hbap2- <dig> would seem to be orthologous to the ant gene  <cit> . ant regulates cell proliferation and organ growth by maintaining the meristematic competence of cells during organogenesis  <cit> . more recently, it was shown to be promoting the initiation and growth of lateral organ primordia, and organ polarity  <cit> . consequently, its very high expression in regenerant hevea callus lines, compared with non-embryogenic and embryogenic lines, was in line with its role in embryo development. with regard to rav, this family is regulated by ethylene  <cit>  and brassinosteroids  <cit> . ravs are involved in the response to biotic and abiotic stress  <cit> . the increase in hbrav <dig> transcripts during somatic embryogenesis induction is in accordance with dramatic changes provoked by ethylene.

control of development and of somatic embryo quality
the ontogenesis of somatic embryos involves an embryo growth phase, followed by the formation of apical meristem and roots, along with the procambial bundles, and lastly the accumulation of reserves needed for germination  <cit> . somatic embryos gradually become dehydrated to acquire the quiescent state  <cit> . the analysis of ap2/erf gene expression carried out at the end of the somatic embryo maturation phase revealed that the relative transcript abundance was very high for a large number of genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis and signalling, along with several ap <dig> genes, including hbap2- <dig>  hbap2- <dig>  hbap2- <dig>  hbap2- <dig>  hbap2- <dig>  hbap2- <dig> and hbap2- <dig> . the potential roles previously described for hbap2- <dig>  and for hbap2- <dig>  highlight the importance of these genes. all the  <dig> marker genes discriminating between the normal and abnormal embryos belonged to the erf family. the abnormal embryos accumulated the transcripts of  <dig> erfs belonging to group i  more than the normal embryos did. the abundance of the transcripts of another dreb gene, hberf-iva <dig> orthologous to dreb2a, in the normal embryos is worth noting. this suggests differential regulation between the two types of embryos for the erfs involved in the response to dehydration, salinity and cold.

CONCLUSIONS
of the  <dig> ap2/erf genes studied,  <dig> were expression markers linked to the different stages of the somatic embryogenesis process in hevea. with the identification of  <dig> very early markers, it was possible to predict the regeneration potential of proliferating callus lines, which opens up prospects for their application in selecting lines of interest for large-scale propagation. the phylogenetic analysis made it possible to predict more precisely the function of certain genes characterized already in arabidopsis. the functions of  <dig> markers suggested that the regulation of hormone and stress signals play just as important a role in somatic embryogenesis as the genes involved in morphogenesis regulation. in addition to these marker genes, another erf gene expressed during somatic embryogenesis is a potential ortholog of crf  encoded by hberf-vi <dig> or hberf-vi <dig> <cit> . an in-depth functional characterization of these markers should lead to a better understanding of somatic embryogenesis and explain the loss of embryogenic capacity, and embryo abnormality. genetic variability in these genes could also be studied to determine whether allelic variations can be used in breeding programmes to select hevea clones not only for agronomic traits but also for their responsiveness to somatic embryogenesis. the ap2/erf superfamily could thus play a major role for several other biological functions in hevea. firstly, rubber production is stimulated by applying ethephon. in cases of over-tapping in situ coagulation of rubber particles leads to production losses: this is tapping panel dryness. secondly, the erf <dig>  erf <dig>  erf <dig> and rav <dig> genes, corresponding to hberf-viia <dig>  hberf-viia <dig>  hberf-viia <dig> and hbrav <dig> <cit> , are induced at the same time as secondary laticifer differentiation  <cit> . studying this superfamily in hevea thus provides some new biological knowledge.
