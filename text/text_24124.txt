BACKGROUND
the regulated processes of ca2+ release from the intracellular stores and its uptake from the cytosol are vital for various biological processes including muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, cell division, and apoptosis  <cit> . for instance, muscle contraction is initiated by membrane depolarization followed by opening of a ryanodine receptor  channel to release ca2+ from the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum  into the cytosol. the process is known as excitation-contraction  coupling  <cit> . rapid efflux of ca2+ from the sr generates a transient negative potential inside the sr lumen and will hinder ca2+ release if the transmembrane potential remains unbalanced. thus, efficient operation of e-c coupling requires not only the ryr to release ca2+, but also counteracting ion channels to restore the balance of the sr membrane potential and maintain ion homeostasis within the sr lumen  <cit> .

two isoforms of sr/endoplasmic reticulum  membrane proteins, called trimeric intracellular cation  channels , presumably function as the counteracting ion channels facilitating the intracellular ca2+ handling processes  <cit> . alternatively, they might serve to restore the balance of trans-sr k+ after the ryrs close, instead of carrying countercurrent during ca2+ release  <cit> . tric channels are permeable to k+ and na+ with moderate selectivity for k+ over na+ and are impermeable to ca2+, mg2+, or anions  <cit> . tric-a and tric-b have distinct single-channel conductances as well as diverse regulatory mechanisms and physiological roles  <cit> . tric-a is regulated by transmembrane voltage  <cit>  and may interact with the ryr functionally and physically  <cit> . tric-b channel is activated by micromolar ca2+ applied on the cytosolic side, but it is inhibited by ca2+ on the luminal side  <cit>  and is also regulated by voltage  <cit> . tric-b may modulate the ca2+-release channel activity of inositol trisphosphate  receptor  <cit>  and is essential for perinatal lung maturation  <cit> . genetic mutations of the human tmem38b gene  are found in patients with a hereditary brittle bone disease called osteogenesis imperfecta . tmem38b knockout mice are deficient in producing collagen, and bone mineralization is impaired in the mutant animals  <cit> . moreover, tric-a contributes to the maintenance of normal blood pressure and may serve as a potential pharmaceutical target for treating hypertension  <cit> . the association of tric channels with bone, pulmonary, and muscular diseases indicates that they have indispensable functions in the related physiological and developmental processes  <cit> .

the structures of tric-b channels from caenorhabditis elegans  revealed a homotrimeric membrane protein-lipid complex with hourglass-shaped pores traversing through each individual monomer  <cit> . a phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -biphosphate p <dig>  also known as pip2) lipid molecule binds specifically to each monomer at 1: <dig> stoichiometry, mediates trimerization of cetric-b channels, and stabilizes the cytoplasmic gate of the channel. in addition to the members found in eukaryotic organisms, tric channel orthologs are widespread in prokaryotes including bacteria and archaea  <cit> . the prokaryotic tric members form the largest group of the tric family, outnumbering eukaryotic ones. a recent study suggested that they may mediate k+ uptake, and the structures of two prokaryotic tric orthologs from rhodobacter sphaeroides  and sulfolobus solfataricus  were reported at  <dig> - and  <dig> -Å resolution, respectively  <cit> . these prokaryotic orthologs form homotrimeric units resembling those of cetric-b channels, and the ion-conducting pore is also contained within each individual monomer  <cit> .

although significant progress has been made on structural and functional studies of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic tric channels, the fundamental mechanistic questions regarding the molecular basis of ion selectivity remain largely open. the pore architectures of tric channels clearly do not resemble those of homotetrameric k+ channels, such as the well-studied kcsa channel  <cit> . we do not know where the ion selectivity filter is located in tric channels or how tric channels selectively bind monovalent cations in their pore region. therefore, it is indispensable to characterize the ion-binding sites along the permeation pathway of tric channels through high-resolution structural studies of tric channels. moreover, the lack of the pip <dig> molecule in prokaryotic tric orthologs raises questions about how their gates are stabilized in the absence of pip <dig> in their structure. here we describe the detailed ion- and water-binding sites inside the pore of each sstric monomer, define the chemical basis of k+ coordination inside a buried asymmetric filter-like structure, and provide new insights into a velcro-like plug-pore interacting model accounting for the gating mechanism of tric channels.

na ratio at  <dig>  , close to the p

na value  of the mammalian tric-a channel reported previously  <cit> . meanwhile, sstric is essentially impermeable to ca2+, mg2+, or cl–, as the reversal potential remains close to 0 mv when 75 mm cacl <dig> or mgcl <dig> is added to the bath solution .fig.  <dig> electrophysiological recording of the activities of the sstric channel reconstituted on liposomes. a representative recordings of the wild-type sstric measured at +60 mv. three major open states are observed in this patch, presumably attributed to the opening of one , two , and three  monomeric pores within an sstric trimer. b the all-points amplitude histogram of the electrophysiological data of the wild-type sstric channel recorded at +60 mv. the bin width is set at  <dig>  pa/bin. the histograms were fitted with four gaussian functions. the four peaks correspond to the closed state , one monomer open , two monomers open , and three monomers open . c the current-voltage relationships of the sstric channel at o <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig> states. the error bars indicate the standard errors of mean values . the number of measurements  is labeled above or below the data points

the structure of sstric solved at  <dig> -Å resolution shows that it forms a symmetrical homotrimer measuring ~56 Å wide and ~40 Å tall, and has flat surfaces on both the extracellular and cytoplasmic sides . it superposes well with the previous structures of sstric in complex with the fab fragment of a monoclonal antibody  of cα atoms =  <dig>  Å), and a bacterial tric homolog  from rhodobacter sphaeroides  <cit>   . when compared to cetric-b <dig> or the ryr , the membrane-embedded domain of the sstric trimer appears to be ~6 Å taller along the dimension parallel to the membrane normal . curiously, the tilt angles of transmembrane helices in sstric with respect to the membrane normal are dramatically different from those in cetric-b1/b <dig> . except for m <dig>  most transmembrane helices  in sstric are tilted from the membrane normal at smaller angles compared to those in cetric-b1/b <dig>  this may arise from the adaptation of membrane proteins to different membrane environments, i.e., the plasma membrane of prokaryotic cells versus er membranes of eukaryotic cells.fig.  <dig> ion- and water-binding sites within the pores of sstric channel. a structure of a sstric homotrimer at  <dig> -Å resolution viewed along the membrane plane. the estimated position of membrane is indicated by the light gray boxes. the k+ ions and water molecules within the pore region are shown as purple and red spheres, respectively. b the sstric trimer viewed along the c <dig> axis from the cytoplasmic side. the green meshes indicate the 2f

both eukaryotic and prokaryotic tric channels harbor their ion-conducting pores within each subunit of the homotrimeric assemblies  <cit> . as shown in fig. 3c, an hourglass-shaped pore runs through each sstric monomer from cytoplasm to extracellular space. along the pore, four bottleneck sites, including two  on the cytoplasmic side, one at the central region , and one close to the extracellular vestibule , form highly constricted areas with extremely small widths at  <dig> – <dig>  Å . for the pore in rstric, the g <dig> site around phe <dig> appears to be slightly wider than the one in sstric, although their overall profiles and pore-lining residues are very similar . for comparison, the pore within each cetric-b monomer harbors two bottlenecks , one on the cytoplasmic side and the other on the luminal side of the er/sr  <cit>  . the pore lumen surface of sstric is mainly shaped by amino acid residues from m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig> helices. within the pore, a single file of eight well-resolved spherical densities was observed in the high-resolution electron density map of the k+-soaked crystal . the four ion/water molecules  on the cytoplasmic side are related to the other four at the p0′–p3′ sites on the extracellular side, and they approximately follow the internal pseudo-c <dig> symmetry  <cit>  between the m1-m2-m <dig> and m4-m5-m <dig> helices. among these densities, two  are located at the pore center area between the g <dig> and g <dig> bottleneck sites , and they intercalate in the grooves of glycine-rich kinks around ala44-gly <dig> and gly130-gly <dig> regions on m <dig> and m <dig>  respectively . previously, two spherical f
o-f
c densities at positions similar to p <dig> and p0′ were observed in the structure of the sstric-fab complex and assigned as water molecules  <cit> .

to test whether any of these potential ion-/water-binding sites inside the pore can be accessed by monovalent cations, we have soaked the sstric crystal with tl+, the electron-rich surrogate of the k+ ion  <cit> . the anomalous difference fourier peaks of tl+ ions are mostly detected on the p0′ and p3′  sites  inside the pore , but not on the p0–p <dig>  sites. by referring to the positions of the tl+ peaks, the putative k+ binding sites have been assigned in the structure of sstric soaked with kcl. as shown in fig. 3e and f, the k+ ion bound on the p0′ site is mainly coordinated by the backbone carbonyl from thr <dig>  backbone amide from gly <dig>  and a water molecule nearby on the p <dig> site. such a coordination mode resembles one half of the k+ coordination observed previously in valinomycin , but differs from the square antiprism-type coordination in kcsa . due to steric hindrance of the bulky side chain of phe <dig>  three additional ligands below k+  are absent in sstric. the water molecule on the p <dig> site is further ligated to the backbone carbonyl groups of val <dig> and gly <dig> and the backbone amide of gly <dig>  the coordination bond lengths between k+ and its ligands on p0′ site are consistent with those  observed in the kcsa channels, although the coordination geometry of k+ in sstric is of trigonal shape instead of the square antiprism found in kcsa  <cit> . the introduction of a g45a/g47a or g132a/g133a mutation in rstric  abolishes its channel activity  <cit> , indicating that the kinks on m <dig> and m <dig> helices are essential for the function of tric channels. in these two mutants, the kinks may have been distorted, leading to loss of the p0′ or p <dig> site . similar kinks are also present on the m <dig> and m <dig> helices of cetric-b channels, and a rb+ ion was found on a site nearby these regions  <cit> . thus, such a double-kink structure with an inverted twofold pseudo-symmetry may represent a general characteristic feature of the tric channel family.

in sstric, the aromatic rings of phe <dig> from the m <dig> helix and phe <dig> from the m <dig> helix enclose the p <dig> and p0′ sites from the other side opposing to the m <dig> kink and m <dig> kink, respectively . the side chains of phe <dig> and phe <dig> not only serve to constrict the pore center to form two bottlenecks  but may also contribute to binding k+ through cation-π interactions  <cit> . mutation of phe <dig> to alanine decreases the p
k/p
na ratio from  <dig>  to  <dig>  , and the f104a mutant is also nearly impermeable to ca2+ or cl– as the wild type . therefore, phe <dig> may have a crucial role in adjusting the permeability of sstric to k+ versus na+, presumably by shaping the geometry of the p0′ site slightly more favorably for binding k+ than na+. corresponding to the two phenylalanine residues in sstric, cetricb1/b <dig> channels have their his34/ <dig> and lys136/lys <dig> positioned nearby the kinks to enclose their central ion-binding sites  <cit> . such a putative asymmetric cation-binding site at the pore center likely serves as the basis for tric channels to selectively bind and conduct monovalent cations  when the flanking bottleneck sites become wider at the open state. besides the k+/tl+ ion on the p0′ site, the one on the p3′ site in the extracellular vestibule of the pore is coordinated by the side chain carboxyl of asp <dig> and the backbone carbonyl of gly <dig>  this peripheral site is close to the extracellular surface, and it may serve to attract k+ ions before they reach the pore center, or facilitate the release of k+ to the extracellular space.

gain-of-function mutants
to further verify whether the ion permeation pathway of the sstric channel does traverse through each monomer as observed in the structure, we have introduced a series of alanine mutations to the key amino acid residues lining the pore lumen surface . expression of the wild-type sstric channel in escherichia coli induces moderate inhibition of cell growth, while the empty vector or expression of a different membrane protein  has little effect on cell growth . such an inhibitory effect is likely due to the basal leaky activity of the sstric channel stimulated by the resting membrane potential  of e. coli cells. the activated sstric channel may leak out intracellular k+ ions, perturb the resting potential balance, and inhibit the growth of e. coli cells moderately . mutation of the key residues along the pore lumen surface  leads to gain-of-function  phenotypes compared to the wild-type channel , resembling the phenotype of a well-established severe gof mutant  of mscl  <cit> . unlike the other mutants, the f16a protein is undetectable in the membrane fraction  or at the whole-cell level, indicating that the protein may have been degraded before forming a functional channel on the membrane due to its high toxicity. as a result, the cells hosting the f16a mutant  grow nearly as normal as the empty vector. the control, the r187a mutant , expresses normally and shows phenotypes similar to the wild type . hence, the in vivo functional assay data are consistent with the observation of a potential ion permeation pathway contained within each sstric monomer.

neutral lipid instead of pip <dig> bound to sstric
at the monomer-monomer interfaces of the sstric trimer, lipid-like moieties have been observed , but the identities of these interfacial cofactors are elusive  <cit> . they have elongated tubular features extending from the peripheral region toward the center of the sstric trimer, and three fatty acyl group-like chains join at the center to form a triskelion-shaped structure enhancing the association of three sstric monomers through hydrophobic interactions. thin layer chromatography and mass spectrometry analyses of the lipid samples extracted from purified sstric preparations suggest that they belong to highly hydrophobic neutral lipid species . a similar pattern of lipid bands is also observed in the sample extracted from the pure preparation of tric ortholog from e. coli . these lipid molecules are not random species bound to sstric. instead, they are most likely specific lipids selected by the hydrophobic binding site with a well-defined triskelion shape. electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis detected the presence of a molecule with an m/z value of  <dig> , likely corresponding to an ionized triacylglycerol molecule, in the lipid samples extracted from purified sstric protein preparation . therefore, the triskelion-shaped density in the sstric trimer is interpreted as a triacylglycerol molecule, and the model fits reasonably well with the electron density . the amino acid residues involved in binding the lipid are mainly hydrophobic residues from the m <dig> and m <dig> helices . in comparison, cetric-b channels contain a pip <dig> lipid molecule per monomer, and the two fatty acyl chains of the pip <dig> molecule extend to the monomer-monomer interfaces , both contributing to trimerization simultaneously  <cit> . like the lipid in sstric, the fatty acyl chains of pip <dig> molecules in cetric-b channels are also surrounded by hydrophobic residues from the m <dig> and m <dig> helices . nevertheless, the bulky hydrophilic inositol  <dig> -biphosphate head group  of pip <dig> inserts through the gap between the m <dig> and m <dig> helices, and is wrapped at the center of each monomer to stabilize the cytoplasmic gate of cetric-b channels . for the lipid molecule in sstric, the three fatty acyl groups  extend laterally through the fenestration between m <dig> and m2′  helices. instead of bending toward the pore region within each monomer , they have reached the external surface facing lipid bilayer . the two positively charged residues  involved in binding the pip <dig> head group in cetric-b are absent in sstric or other prokaryotic orthologs. no bulky hydrophilic head groups are attached to the fatty acyl chains of the lipid found in the sstric channel, suggesting that prokaryotic tric channels may adopt a different mechanism to stabilize the cytoplasmic gate. it is noteworthy that sulfolobus solfataricus and other archaea contain ether-linked lipids   <cit>  instead of the ester-linked lipids commonly found in bacterial or eukaryotic cells. therefore, the sstric from its native cellular environments may adopt the ether lipids in its structure.

a tethered plug-like motif at the cytoplasmic gate
how does sstric stabilize its cytoplasmic gate in the absence of a bulky lipid head group? the pore of the sstric channel is more open on the extracellular side than the intracellular side . what is the cause of such dramatic differences between the outer and inner vestibules of the sstric channel? each sstric monomer consists of three motifs, called motif a, motif b, and motif c, respectively . motif a contains m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  and two short amphipathic helices. motif b comprises m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  and one short amphipathic helix in the m5–m <dig> loop region. these two motifs correspond to the n-repeat and c-repeat described in the previous study  <cit> . motif a is related to motif b by a pseudo-c <dig> axis running approximately parallel to the membrane plane . they superpose well with the root mean square deviation  of α-carbon atoms at  <dig>  Å , and their sequences share 25% identity . the side chains of three key residues from motif b, namely tyr <dig>  met <dig>  and arg <dig>  collectively contribute to occlusion of the inner vestibule of the pore . on the other side, their symmetry-related counterparts in motif a are either oriented away from the pore region  or replaced by ala residue  . the insertion of pro <dig>  within the m2–m <dig> loop region directs the side chains of gln <dig> and tyr <dig> away from the pore region to create an open cavity on the extracellular side . thus, these differences between motifs a and b result in the asymmetric status of the sstric channel with its outer vestibule open and inner vestibule closed.fig.  <dig> a tethered plug motif in sstric channel. a occlusion of the cytoplasmic vestibule by the plug motif. the sectional view of the surface model of sstric structure shows the position of plug motif inside the cytoplasmic vestibule. b the plug motif tethered in the loop region between m <dig> and m <dig> helices. the plug motif is highlighted in yellow, and the basic residues are shown as stick models colored in cyan  or green . the magenta elliptical rings define an array of three basic residues nearby the plug motif. c the velcro-like interactions between the plug motif and the potential voltage-sensing basic residues. green dashed lines indicate the hydrogen bonds or ionic interactions between two adjacent residues. bond lengths  are labeled nearby the dashed lines. d a model of sstric with plug motif dislocated or removed. for comparison, the view is identical to the one shown in a. the cytoplasmic vestibule appears much wider and extends closer toward the bottom of extracellular vestibule. the dashed line denotes the mobilized plug motif at an unknown position




on the cytoplasmic side, the region between the m <dig> and m <dig> helices forms a loop-helix-loop motif  . it plugs in the inner vestibule of the hourglass-shaped pore and contributes to the formation of the first two bottlenecks  within the cytoplasmic vestibule. this plug-like motif binds to asp <dig>  arg <dig>  and asp <dig> residues lining the surface of the pore lumen, through hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions . thereby, it is stabilized in a position to block the access of ions into the pore . removal of the plug-like motif from the structure generates a wide-open cavity in the cytoplasmic vestibule region . in this model, the open cytoplasmic vestibule becomes closer to the pore center and approaches the bottom of the extracellular vestibule.

among the residues from the plug motif, tyr <dig> is closest to the pore center near phe <dig>  and forms a strong hydrogen bond with asp <dig> . strikingly, the position of the tyr <dig> bulky side chain coincides with that of the inositol  <dig> -biphosphate head group of the pip <dig> molecule in cetric-b <dig>  when the structure of sstric is superposed with that of cetric-b <dig> . in cetric-b <dig>  the head group of the pip <dig> molecule stabilizes the cytoplasmic gate through binding to two basic residues on the pore lumen  <cit> . likewise, tyr <dig> in sstric may have a similar role in controlling the cytoplasmic entrance through its bulky side chain, and may behave like a plug to the hourglass bottleneck. the electrophysiological analyses on the y153a mutant of sstric confirm its role as a crucial gating element of the channel. the mutant appears more active than the wild type . remarkably, the right shift of the amplitude histogram peaks of y153a in respect to those of the wild type indicates that the conductance of the y153a mutant is larger than that of the wild type . moreover, the open probability  of y153a is also higher than that of the wild type . the open state of the y153a mutant also has a longer lifetime than that of wild type , while the closed-state lifetime remains very similar . this indicates that the y153a mutation gives the channel an increased stability at the open state. taken together, the electrophysiological behaviors of the y153a mutant and the structural observations both demonstrate that tyr <dig> has a pivotal role in the gating process of the sstric channel. it acts as a tethered plug being latched onto the surface of the pore lumen that occludes the pore from the cytoplasmic side.fig.  <dig> effects of y153a mutation on the electrophysiological behaviors of sstric channel. a tyr <dig> and the surrounding residues in sstric. the plug motif is highlighted in yellow. tyr <dig> is highlighted as a van der waals  model, and the residues surrounding tyr <dig> are shown as cyan stick models. the red dashed lines with distances  labeled nearby indicate hydrogen bond or ionic interactions between two adjacent residues. the view is from the cytoplasmic side. b superposition of a sstric monomer with a cetric-b <dig> monomer. the protein backbones are shown as cartoon models in yellow  or blue . the pip <dig> molecule in cetric-b <dig> is presented as a stick model in blue and red. pdb code: 5eik for cetric-b <dig>  c representative electrophysiological recordings of the wild-type sstric  and y153a mutant  measured at +60 mv. d the all-points amplitude histogram of the y153a  and wild-type  data. the presence of six open-state peaks indicates these patches likely contain two trimers of y153a/wild-type sstric channels. the bin width is set at  <dig>  pa/bin. the histograms were both fitted with seven gaussian functions. c, o1–o <dig> represent the closed state and opening of one to six monomers. e open probability  analysis on the y153a mutant  and wild-type channel . np

discussion
as shown in additional file 5: figure s5d and e, the site for tric channels to select and bind monovalent cations  during their permeation through the pore is most likely located at the central region around the two kinks on the m <dig> and m <dig> helices according to the following evidences. firstly, two discrete water-/ion-binding sites  have been located in this region, and one of them  is accessible to a k+ surrogate . secondly, the coordination bond lengths between the ion on p0′ and the surrounding ligands are consistent with the k+-ligand bond length values observed in the kcsa or valinomycin structures . thirdly, the kinks on m <dig> and m <dig> are general features conserved in the structures of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic tric channels. such an asymmetric filter-like structure is evidently different from those of kcsa  and may represent a new type of monovalent cation-binding site for ion channels. in this filter, k+ was bound in a monohydrated state and forms a trigonal geometry with its ligands, resembling half of the trigonal-antiprism k+ coordinations in valinomycin . for comparison, the filter in kcsa contains four consecutive layers of discrete k+-binding sites with a square antiprism geometry, and the k+ ion is bound in the center . such a multilayer symmetrical filter in kcsa is more selective  than the single-layer asymmetric filter in the tric channel. the p
k/p
na permeability ratio for the kcsa channel is  <dig>  or higher  <cit> , whereas the p
k/p
na ratio of the sstric and mammalian tric channels is much lower at  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> , respectively. lastly, the f104a mutant of sstric has a lower p
k/p
na ratio compared to the wild type, indicating that the mutant becomes less selective between k+ and na+. the result suggests that the geometry of the fourth pore constriction site  shaped by the bulky side chain of phe <dig> and m2/m <dig> kinks is likely crucial for tuning the relative selectivity of sstric channel for k+ versus na+.

the plug regions in prokaryotic tric orthologs contain a consensus “px5-7exya” motif, while the regions interacting with the plug comprise two consensus motifs, namely the “daxgl” motif on m <dig> and the “ggxxrd” motif on m <dig> . such conservation suggests that the velcro-like plug-pore interactions might serve as a general gating mechanism for the prokaryotic tric orthologs. these three consensus motifs have become diversified in the eukaryotic members. the comparison between sstric and a cetric-b channel reveals an unexpected diverse feature of the pore plugs among the prokaryotic and eukaryotic members of the family . while the prokaryotic orthologs utilize a built-in plug in the m5–m <dig> loop region to control their cytoplasmic gates, the eukaryotic members have evolved a different strategy by adopting a lipid molecule, namely phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -bisphosphate , as the plug to their pores. the head group of pip <dig> latches onto two basic residues on the pore lumen surface and occludes the pore from the cytoplasmic side . the m5–m <dig> loop region in the eukaryotic tric proteins turns into an irregular structure capping over the pip <dig> head group, instead of forming a plug motif itself. in spite of these evident differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic members of tric family, they share a common overall channel architecture and are probably unified by a general gating mechanism involving a velcro-like plug-pore interaction. a model accounting for the potential gating mechanism of sstric has been summarized in additional file 10: figure s <dig> 

the previous bioinformatics study suggested potential roles of prokaryotic tric orthologs in the efflux of metabolites  <cit> . this prediction awaits verification by further experimental evidences to demonstrate the physiological relevance of tric channel function in the transport processes of metabolites. a recent work on rstric and sstric indicated that they are involved in k+ uptake in e. coli cells  <cit> . expression of sstric on the e. coli membrane leads to moderate inhibition of cell growth, resembling the phenotype of a gain-of-function ion channel . it is likely constitutively active on the e. coli membrane when a resting potential at − <dig> to −140 mv is present at different growth phases  <cit> . putatively, the prokaryotic tric members might serve as membrane-potential regulators to prevent imbalance of resting potential  and to maintain ion homeostasis in the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells, instead of serving as a metabolite transporters themselves. such a role may serve to regulate the active transport processes of metabolites across the membrane indirectly, as many transporters are driven by the electrochemical potential across the membrane  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the high-resolution view of ion- and water-binding sites in the sstric channel unravels the presence of an asymmetric filter-like structure buried in the middle of an hourglass pore. the velcro-like plug-pore interacting model derived in this study may offer a unified framework for understanding the gating mechanism of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic tric channels.
