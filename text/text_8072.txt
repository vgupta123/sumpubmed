BACKGROUND
marek’s disease  is a lymphoproliferative disease of chickens caused by the marek’s disease virus , a naturally occurring alphaherpesvirus  <cit> . the virus targets lymphoid tissue such as the bursa of fabricius, thymus, and spleen, where it infects b and t cells  <cit> . the pathological characteristics of md include mononuclear infiltration of the peripheral nerves, gonads, iris, various viscera, muscles, and skin. susceptible chickens develop lymphomas in visceral tissues and enlarged nerves resulting in paralysis, blindness, and eventually death. economic losses to the poultry industry due to condemnation in broilers  and reduction in egg production in layers  are estimated to be $1- <dig> billion per year  <cit> . due to the persistent nature of the virus in the feather dander shed from mdv-infected birds, all commercial chickens are exposed at a very early age. although md vaccines can prevent the formation of tumors, they do not prevent viral replication and bird-to-bird spread. the lack of sterilizing immunity is thought to be a major contributing factor for mdv field strains evolving to higher virulence  <cit> , which can result in unpredictable and devastating disease outbreaks in vaccinated commercial flocks.

an attractive solution to augment md vaccinal and husbandry control measures is to increase genetic resistance in commercial chicken lines through marker-assisted or genomic selection, which avoids the need to expose elite flocks under selection to a hazardous pathogen. in the past, focusing on the experimental white leghorn  lines  <dig> and  <dig>  which are md resistant and susceptible, respectively, we have utilized multiple techniques such as genome-wide qtl scans  <cit> , transcript profiling with microarrays  <cit> , and protein-protein interaction  <cit>  screens to understand the response to mdv infection and md genetic resistance. integrating the results from these approaches identified three genes and many other strong candidates that confer genetic resistance to md  <cit> . while promising, these genes account for only a small fraction of the observed genetic variation, a situation that is similar for many other complex traits.

allele-specific expression  is a powerful technique that measures the expression of each allele via a marker single nucleotide polymorphism  within a rna sample. when a gene shows allelic imbalance, it is sufficient to identify a cis-acting regulatory element  <cit> . the key advantage of this approach is identification of a snp exhibiting ase, though likely not to be causative, is in tight linkage disequilibrium with the causative polymorphism, thus, essentially identifying a high-confidence candidate gene  with expression variation. and since variation in gene expression is thought to be a major factor accounting for phenotypic variation, genes with ase snps provide candidates and markers that may account for the complex trait of interest.

in this study, the primary aim was to use ase to identify snps associated with variation in transcriptional response to mdv infection in both broilers and layers, which would provide a strong foundation for future evaluations of genetic resistance to md. in addition, the resulting information allowed us to compare the identified snps, genes, and pathways enriched between these two diverse chicken types. furthermore, since rna sequencing  data is comparable to microarray data, gene counts were used to identify genes differentially expressed  in response to mdv infection and, subsequently, used to evaluate the biological pathways that were shared between the broiler and layer chickens.

RESULTS
md incidence in broilers
as the long-term objective is to improve md genetic resistance through genomic selection, we first needed to identify broiler pure lines that differed substantially in md incidence; layer lines  <dig> and  <dig> are already known to be md resistant and susceptible, respectively  <cit> . anecdotal information suggested that cobb-vantress lines “red” and “blue” used in this study differed in md genetic resistance. we confirmed these differences in two mdv challenge trials , where the red line birds had about twice the md incidence as those from the blue line.


whole-genome transcriptomics and ase snp discovery
in the present experiment, we sequenced rna samples from  <dig> uninfected and  <dig> infected birds for each type . for the broiler dataset, with one exception, the average number of single end raw reads was approximately  <dig> million , and after quality trimming was between  <dig> million and  <dig> million. tophat/bowtie  <cit>  aligned 68-81% of the reads to the chicken genome with nearly  <dig> % of the reads in the resulting alignments having a mapping quality score of  <dig> or higher . these high quality scores were necessary to confidently call snps with a minimum of false positives. using freebayes  <cit> , snps were called within alignments from similar treatment samples , with criteria to contain at least  <dig> reads in the population. the average number of snps finally called was in approximate range of  <dig> - <dig>  per sample in the broilers.

for layer samples, similar quality control measures were undertaken to reduce false positives snps. for these rnas, sequencing was performed using the illumina hiseq platform, which not only produced more reads compared to the broiler-generated data  but also produced longer pair end fragments . the average number of reads ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> million per sample. the average number of snps called was in approximate range of  <dig> - <dig>  per sample in the layers. the increase in reads provided more confidence in snp calls  but did not significantly increase the number of snps called between the samples . also, higher read depth did not significantly change the tophat/bowtie  <cit>  alignment statistics between the samples .

an analysis of variance  was used to identify the snps that showed ase due to mdv infection in broilers or layers. after further filtering of the raw snp data, an anova was performed on  <dig>  snps from the broiler snp dataset and  <dig>  snps for the layer that passed our test criteria . based on anova significance , the number of snps exhibiting ase in response to mdv infection in broilers and layers was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . no correction was made for multiple testing because the list of genes would be tested subsequently for pathway enrichment. in the fisher exact test invoked in david  <cit>  to identify enriched pathways, the proportion of genes submitted must be significantly greater than the proportion of genes found by chance. in this way, type  <dig> errors  are reduced in the first step while the pathway test in the second step includes an experiment wise error rate to control for type  <dig> errors .

classification of ase snps
the significant snps exhibiting ase in response to mdv infection for both broilers and layers were distributed on chromosomes  <dig> to  <dig> of the chicken genome, with the number of snps per each chromosome roughly proportional to the size of the each chromosome in the chicken genome assembly .

to locate these snps on the chicken genome with respect to genes and classify them based on function, annovar  <cit>  was used. in the broiler population, the largest number of snps  was classified as exonic . the second largest number of snps fell in the intergenic group , and the third largest group were located downstream of a gene . as rna was sequenced and analyzed, snps in both of these latter categories reflect the incomplete or inaccurate annotation of the chicken genome. similarly in layers, the two largest classifications of snps associated with intergenic  and exonic  regions .


a nucleotide position match between broiler and layer ase snps showed  <dig> snps matched at the exact position . these  <dig> snps were distributed in  <dig> genes . at the gene level, there were  <dig> genes showing ase in response to infection that were common between the two chicken types . the observed overlap was not significant suggesting different genes are responsible for conferring md resistance between the broiler and layer lines examined.


the ase data were further analyzed to quantify the biological implications due to the presence of a snp. a function-based approach using annovar classified the snps as synonymous, nonsynonymous, stop gain, and stop loss . in broiler and layers,  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps, respectively, were identified . the largest category in both chicken types was synonymous implying that the snps were neutral and downstream amino acid changes were not significant. the second largest category in both the chicken breeds was nonsynonymous snps. a very small number of the snps fell into the other two categories .


differential expression  analysis in response to mdv infection
de was estimated by obtaining count data from each biological sample  using the htseq script  <cit> . the ensembl exon annotation file  <cit>  identified  <dig>  chicken genes of which  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were expressed in the broilers and layers, respectively. deseq analysis  <cit>  was used to estimate de and a total of  <dig> and  <dig> genes were revealed following mdv infection  in broilers and layers, respectively . the fold change ranged from − <dig>  to  <dig>  and − <dig>  to  <dig>  in broilers and layers, respectively. of the genes that were significant, only  <dig> were common between the broiler and layer chickens.

pathway analysis of ase and de genes
to identify potential common pathways, gene lists obtained by ase and de analysis were analyzed for biological process and pathway enrichment using david  <cit> . due to the likely limited effect of snps falling in the intergenic, intronic, and downstream regions of the chicken genome , we further filtered the input gene list to only include genes that corresponded to snps that were found to be synonymous, nonsynonymous, or located at the 5’ utr, and 3’ utr regions. from the initial gene list ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes following ase analysis in the broiler and layer samples, respectively, were queried. using functional annotation clustering, at the highest classification stringency,  <dig> and  <dig> clusters were formed in broilers and layers, respectively. when an enrichment cutoff at > <dig>  was used, only  <dig> and  <dig> clusters were chosen in broilers and layer samples, respectively . there were no common enriched clusters between both datasets. the pathways analysis invoked in david yielded  <dig> and  <dig> pathways in the broiler and layer samples, respectively . of these samples, there were three pathways that were common between the two bird types: apoptosis, dna replication, and amino and nucleotide sugar metabolism. there were additional pathways found that were unique to each chicken type . david analysis of nonsynonymous ase snps from broilers and layers also resulted in no common pathways that were found to be enriched  but  <dig> genes were obtained that were common to both bird lines . furthermore, out of the  <dig> common genes obtained,  <dig> genes were functional annotated using david .


similar david analyses were performed on the de gene list obtained from broiler and layer samples. based on functional annotation,  <dig> and  <dig> clusters were obtained in the broiler and layer samples from an initial input of  <dig> and  <dig> gene ids, respectively. with the enrichment cutoff set to > <dig> , there were  <dig> and  <dig> clusters in the broiler and layer samples, respectively . of these clusters,  <dig> clusters were enriched and showed exact matches between the broilers and layers . at the pathway level for de genes,  <dig> and  <dig> pathways were identified in broilers and layers, respectively . two common pathways were found, which were toll-like receptor  signaling and jak/stat signaling.


discussion
ase is a powerful and elegant technique that separates gene expression signals into allelic components resulting in significantly increased sensitivity and added power, and can be used to understand the genetics of gene regulation. in this study, we used ase to investigate transcriptional regulation in response to mdv infection in two different chicken types, specifically broilers and layers. the primary objective of this study was to identify snps exhibiting ase responding to mdv infection, which would provide a strong foundation for future experiments designed to identify genes conferring genetic resistance to md. since it takes  <dig> days post infection  for mdv to undergo its first lytic cycle, transcriptional changes are most likely to occur prior to the prevalence of this phenotypic observation and, thus,  <dig> dpi was chosen as the sampling window captures to capture these transcriptional changes in the birds. in this experiment, we were able to successfully align rna-seq reads to the reference chicken genome and identify high quality snps in both broiler and layer chickens using our pipeline as described. as a result, we identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps significant snps in  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes from broiler and layer samples, respectively.

in chicken, the power of rna-seq will not be fully realized until the reference genome sequence is finished  <cit>   and gene models and annotation become more complete. for example, while only exons should be transcribed, nonetheless, a large percentage of the snps, when classified using annovar, fell into categories such as downstream, intronic and intergenic regions. poor genome annotation is most likely responsible for the classification of snps in non-exonic regions as we obtained high quality reads with excellent coverage. we are in the process of developing new gene models based on our experimental rna-seq data from this study and additional ones.

at the snp and gene level,  <dig> snps and  <dig> genes  were common between ase broiler and layer samples. the occurrence of identical snp positions was negligible, which was expected given the wide genetic divergence between these two chicken types, and therefore is due to chance. comparison of the enriched pathways obtained from ase snp positions also showed little similarities between the two bird types . we conclude, based on the lack of concordance between the lists of identified snps, genes and pathways, there is no evidence to suggest common genetic elements that respond to mdv infection in these two bird types; this result also supports the notion that md genetic resistance is complex and can result from different gene combinations. if true on a broader scale, then genetic markers for complex traits such as genetic resistance to md based on ase screens will need to be performed on each population and cannot be extrapolated from one bird line to another.

the chicken major histocompatibility complex  plays an important role in the determination of resistance to mdv  <cit> . the chicken chromosome  <dig> contains  <dig> loci namely, the b locus, the y  locus and the nucleolar-organizing region . loci b and y are unlinked and evolve independently  <cit> . in this study, in our analysis of nonsynonymous ase snps in broilers and layers, we found a snp associated with a gene that encodes for class i alpha chain of the rfp-y loci . this result supports previous findings that have linked mhc to mdv resistance. however, our predications are limited due to incomplete sequence information of chromosome  <dig> for both galgal <dig> and galgal <dig> chicken genome builds. this limitation combined with the fact that many of the relevant genes have multiple family members hindered our effects to ascribe ase on mhc genes and the pathways downstream.

despite hindrances such as incomplete gene models, we successfully identified two pathways namely, tlr signaling and jak/stat signaling  <cit> , by analyzing de in broilers and layers. recently, smith and co-workers  <cit>  reported the enrichment of the above-mentioned pathways in layers in response to mdv infection. our data suggest that broilers also show similar pathway enrichment, thus, we conclude they have similar pathways for responding to mdv infection.

understanding the biological implications of large datasets generated by rna-seq can be challenging. moreover, to identify genetic effects that play an important role in downstream regulation and expression is a major concern in fully understanding the significance of pathways or networks. one hypothesis proposed by clark et al.  <cit>  was to consider the association of upstream gene or loci as genetic factors that influence downstream processes such as gene expression. in other words, downstream de in genes could be controlled by genetic factors  upstream in key regulatory pathways. to dissect the influence of ase on downstream de analysis, we searched for possible associations between pathways enriched for genes with differential expression  and genes exhibiting variation in transcriptional response .

our data supports the above hypothesis of an underlying genetic component amplifying the expression of downstream genes in a pathway. specifically, examination of the two common pathways , as shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  genes exhibiting ase in response to mdv were found at the beginning of each pathway. specifically, genes encoding cd <dig>  ly <dig> , tlr <dig>  and myd <dig> exhibit ase in response to mdv infection and are found at the start of the tlr receptor-signaling pathway, which contains genes with de in layers and especially for broilers. likewise, il5r, il21r of the cytokine r module, ptpn <dig> , and ptpn <dig>  are all found at the beginning of the jak/stat pathway for broilers and layers. it is also interesting to note that growth hormone , one of the three md resistance genes identified  <cit> , also lies at the start of the jak/stat pathway though we could not evaluate for ase due to the lack of snps in the f <dig> progeny. interestingly, nuclear factor-kappa b , which regulates genes associated with cell survival, proliferation, programmed cell death , stress, inflammation, and immunity was previously shown to be a key component of mdv infection  <cit>  and showed ase in the layers in this study as well as being a member of the tlr signaling pathway among others . if the genes at the beginning of the aforementioned pathways do confer genetic resistance to md, then this has strong implications on how to analyze rna-seq data to identify strong candidate genes in other complex traits.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have successfully identified snps associated with ase in both broilers and layers chicken types, as well as revealed genes and pathways that were common or unique to each bird or analysis type. thus, the method is powerful for identifying snps and genes that exhibit differential allelic response to mdv infection as well as providing candidate markers and genes for md genetic resistance. furthermore, we believe that greater exploration should be performed placed on genes exhibiting ase at the beginning of pathways identified by gene expression enrichment analysis. the larger question that still remains is how much do genes exhibiting ase  account for overall genetic variation in complex traits such as md genetic resistance? to answer this question, we have developed a custom chip containing ase snps that is being genotyped on an md resource population, which will determine, if present, the size of effect and which alleles are favorable for genetic resistance to md.
