BACKGROUND
neurogenesis in the early vertebrate neural plate begins at stereotyped loci - termed proneural clusters -, which prefigure the localization of the earliest neuronal groups and the architecture of the primary embryonic neuronal scaffold. these proneural clusters consist of spatially defined progenitor groups engaged in active neurogenesis, within which committed precursors expressing higher levels of proneural genes  are singled out to differentiate first. an identical scaffold is found in all vertebrate embryos, highlighting the robustness and functional relevance of this organization  <cit> . dissecting the regulatory cascades involved in this process is therefore of universal importance.

the control of neurogenesis progression within proneural clusters relies on hairy/enhancer of split ) factors . these transcription factors belong to the basic-helix-loop-helix  family, characterized by a dna-binding basic domain and an hlh domain composed of two alpha helices intervened by a loop of a few amino acids  <cit> . in addition, hairy/enhancer of split ) factors contain an orange domain, which is most probably involved in protein-protein interactions, and a wrpw c-terminal tetrapeptide, which mediates transcriptional repression . during the so-called process of lateral inhibition, the expression of notch ligands in committed precursors activates notch signaling in neighbouring progenitors, which in turn induces expression of hes/her factors. the latter down-regulate proneural genes, hence maintaining notch-receiving cells in a progenitor state. reflecting the intermingled distribution of committed and transiently inhibited progenitors, the proneural and e genes are expressed in a salt-and-pepper fashion within proneural clusters. e factors expressed in proneural clusters in zebrafish include her <dig>   <cit> , hes5/her <dig>  her <dig> and her <dig>  <cit> . in agreement with the lateral inhibition model, her <dig>  expression is positively regulated by notch, and inhibits expression of neurog <dig>  <cit> .

recent work has demonstrated that proneural clusters are delimited negatively, through a process of active neurogenesis suppression taking place in surrounding areas . these "inhibited" areas, so-called "progenitor pools", are transiently maintained in an refractory state to be recruited in later events of neuronal production, and are organized as tight groups of adjacent cells at stereotyped positions within the neural plate. major progenitor pools can be found at the presumptive midbrain-hindbrain boundary   <cit>  and in longitudinal stripes separating the columns of presumptive moto- and lateral neurons in the hindbrain, or moto-, inter- and sensory neurons in the spinal cord  <cit> . at the least, the mhb pool is maintained until adulthood in zebrafish, where it participates in the generation of adult-born neurons and oligodendrocytes  <cit> . embryonic progenitor pools are characterised by the expression of a specific set of transcription factors, including zic, bf1/anf and rx family members  <cit>  as well as hes/her proteins. in zebrafish, the combinatorial expression of a distinct set of her genes - which to date includes her <dig>  her <dig>  her <dig> and her <dig> - characterises all progenitor pools  <cit> , while in mouse the genes hes <dig>  hes <dig> and hes <dig> share sustained expression in adjacent cells of the mhb pool, for example  <cit> . these her/hes genes exhibit functional similarities and have been implicated in progenitor pool maintenance: their misexpression inhibits neurogenesis, whereas loss-of-function causes premature expression of proneural genes in at least part of their expression domains  <cit> . in addition, her3/5/9/ <dig> as well as hes <dig> at the mouse mhb all demonstrate an irregular association with notch: while hes/her genes in proneural clusters are activated by notch signaling, the expression of her3/5/9/ <dig> and hes <dig> at the mhb is controlled in a notch-independent manner. the mechanisms accounting for these specific features remain unknown.

the hlh region of hes/her factors functions as a dimerisation domain, and the formation of hetero- and homodimers as well as further possible interactions through the orange domain are key components of the specificity of the actions of these proteins. heterodimerisation can involve closely related members of the her/hes family, or several different transcription factors or transcriptional cofactors  <cit> . in order to better understand the mechanism of action of her factors expressed in progenitor pools, and the pathways regulating their activity, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the hlh and orange domains of her <dig> as bait. this led to the recovery of her8a, a novel her factor of the hes <dig> subfamily expressed in a broad manner at the presumptive midbrain-hindbrain domain of the early zebrafish neural plate. morpholino-mediated knockdown and misexpression studies establish her8a as a negative-regulator of neurogenesis playing an essential role in maintaining progenitor pools of rhombomeres   <dig> and  <dig>  her8a knockdown produces a similar phenotype to that of her <dig> knockdown, and co-purification demonstrates that her8a dimerises with her <dig>  at the mhb however, we show that the predominant activity is exerted by the combination of her <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  together, our results identify a new player in progenitor pool formation and highlight the region-specific combinatorial activity of e factors in this process.

RESULTS
identification of her8a as a potential binding partner for her proteins
to recover binding partners for her proteins, we used a yeast two-hybrid screen where a 181-amino acid fragment of her <dig>  was screened against an 18- <dig> hpf embryo zebrafish library. this screen returned  <dig> positive clones, from a total of  <dig>  million tested interactions. these  <dig> positive clones represented  <dig> unique protein-protein interactions. the quality of these interactions was graded using a pbs scoring system - where a is the highest score of confidence, b is very good, c is good, d is low and n/a is used when no score could be assigned . our screen returned  <dig> as,  <dig> bs,  <dig> cs,  <dig> ds and  <dig> n/as . gene ontology enrichment analysis of the recovered binding partners revealed an enrichment of proteins involved in protein transport and also heterodimerisation . among these candidates, we note the presence of  <dig> distinct her factors, in agreement with the postulated capacity for protein heterodimerisation within this family  <cit> . as further indication of the validity of the assay, her <dig> was found to bind with her <dig> with a score of b, an interaction that had been shown previously in our laboratory  <cit> . her8a, scored a and corresponding to a new e family member, proved very strongly expressed in the midbrain-hindbrain  area , and we consequently focused on this factor.

her8a is a new hes6-like protein, the ortholog of which was lost in the mammalian lineage
the predicted her8a protein displays a bhlh and an orange domain, and harbors a wrpw motif at its c-terminus - characteristics common to the hairy/e family. sequence comparisons of the bhlh domain of this family classify her8a, together with zebrafish her <dig> , hes <dig>  and her <dig> , within the subfamily showing highest homology to mouse hes <dig>  <cit> . proteins of this subfamily exhibit a shortened loop when compared to other hairy-e members  <cit> , such as mouse hes <dig> and hes <dig> . hes6-like proteins also share substantial similarity outside the bhlh domains , allowing their phylogeny to be studied using extended protein sequences. this confirmed the existence of two subfamilies of hes6-like proteins, hes <dig>  and hes <dig> , comprising respectively her13/hes <dig> and her8a/her <dig>   , encoded by gene pairs . importantly, it also resolved for the first time their relationship with the single mammalian hes <dig> protein, as sequence alignments directly assign mammalian hes <dig> to the hes <dig>  subfamily . hes <dig> -like genes are found neither in eutherian mammals nor in marsupials, but exist in all other phyla, suggesting a late secondary loss of this gene shortly after the divergence of eutherians and marsupials from the monotreme lineage. finally, and as expected from the whole genome duplication undergone in the teleost fish lineage subsequent to its divergence from other vertebrates  <cit> , followed by secondary gene loss, teleost species exhibit three or four hes6-like genes. synteny analyses  indeed identify a conserved orthologous gene pair  as well as a conserved duplicate . this duplicate only contains the hes <dig> -like member and, based on the situation in other vertebrates, most likely lost the hes <dig> -like gene. strikingly, in zebrafish, the latter gene  was kept and transferred onto a different genomic location . together, these results indicate that her8a is the ortholog of her <dig>  and that it is located in a unique genomic setting compared to other related genes. it also assigns her8a to a subfamily of hes6-like genes that is closely related to but not directly orthologous to mammalian hes <dig> 

her8a is expressed across progenitor pools and proneural clusters in the anterior neural plate
among hes6-like genes, we found that her8a was the only one with expression in the anterior neural plate at the 3-somite stage. at this stage, her <dig> was restricted to a portion of the presumptive lateral proneural clusters in the anterior spinal cord . as shown previously, hes <dig> was found to be expressed in the tail bud and posterior paraxial mesoderm , and her <dig>  was very weakly or not expressed . in contrast, following weak expression during gastrulation  <cit> , her8a displayed strong expression in the neural plate from the tailbud stage onwards. at tailbud, her8a is expressed throughout the neural plate, with the exception of the eye field and the midline, with strongest intensity at presumptive midbrain and hindbrain levels . at early segmentation stages, the domain of strong her8a expression overlaps with that of genes expressed in progenitor pools within the presumptive mid- and hindbrain, such as her <dig>  and her <dig>  . it also encompasses the proneural clusters located in the mid- and anterior hindbrain area . at  <dig> somites her8a is expressed in stripes in the hindbrain, with denser expression in rhombomeres   <dig> and 3- <dig> . expression in the midbrain persists. from 24hpf onwards, her8a acquires a distinct expression profile, highlighting neurogenic domains throughout the central nervous system, with weaker staining at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary   and at the zona limitans intrathalamica  . cross sections of the brain at this stage reveal that her8a expression is confined to the progenitor, ventricular domain, largely complementary to the expression of the post-mitotic neuronal marker huc/d . from 48hpf through to adult, her8a remains expressed in proliferation/ventricular zones throughout the brain .

gain of her8a function inhibits neurogenesis
mouse and xenopus hes <dig> proteins are known as positive regulators of differentiation  <cit> . in this context, the expression of her8a across both pro-neural and non-neurogenic domains was puzzling and prompted us to explore her8a function.

in a first gain-of-function approach, embryos were injected with her8a capped mrna encoding the full-length protein at the one cell stage. they were subsequently fixed and analyzed at  <dig> somites. we observed that her8a misexpression caused a complete loss of neurog <dig> expression throughout the embryo  . co-labeling with tp <dig> , which highlights the border of the epidermal ectoderm juxtaposed to the neural plate  <cit>  , showed that the size or morphology of the neural plate were not affected , suggesting that overexpressing her8a specifically blocks neurogenesis without an effect on neural plate formation. this was confirmed by expression analyses for patterning markers such as barhl <dig>  her <dig> and her <dig>  which highlight distinct domains along the entire antero-posterior axis of the neural plate  <cit>  . together, these results indicate that her8a is capable of inhibiting neurogenesis, at least at non-physiological concentrations, and this even across domains normally co-expressing neurog <dig> and her8a such as the proneural clusters of the mid- and anterior hindbrain .

her8a is required to maintain the proper neurogenesis pattern in rhombomeres  <dig> and  <dig> and acts as binding partner for her3
to better appreciate the endogenous requirements for her8a, we next turned to a loss-of-function approach. embryos at the one-cell stage were injected with morpholinos  directed against the donor splice site of her8a exon  <dig> , the acceptor splice site of her8a exon  <dig> , or the her8a atg , and were analyzed at  <dig> somites. reverse transcription pcr was used to reveal strong down-regulation of expression and abnormal splicing of her8a transcripts with both mo <dig> and mo <dig>  whereas other genes, such as βactin <dig>  remained unaffected . these observations substantiate that her8amos lead to knock-down of her8a expression.

blocking her8a resulted in an ectopic expression of neurog <dig> within the normally non-neurogenic area separating motor- and lateral proneural clusters of r <dig> and  <dig>  . although the location of neurog1-positive cells can be slightly variable from embryo to embryo, this phenotype was robust and never observed in wild-type animals. the results obtained with the three mos were strictly identical , confirming their specificity. we will compile these data below. this knockdown phenotype strikingly resembles the published effect of her <dig> knockdown  <cit> , which we further confirmed  . given that the r2/r <dig> area of ectopic neurogenesis is where the intense expression of her8a overlaps with that of her <dig> , these identical phenotypes suggest a direct or indirect functional interaction of her <dig> and her8a in controlling common progenitors. as a first obvious possibility, we tested whether her <dig> and her8a influence each other's expression. ruling out this scenario, her8amo-injected embryos displayed a normal expression of her <dig>  and her3mo embryos a normal expression of her8a  . a following hypothesis is that her <dig> and her8a act in a dose-dependent manner to compensate for each other outside r <dig> and r <dig>  with r <dig> and r <dig> showing highest sensitivity to the amount of "her3+her8a" proteins. a similar situation was previously demonstrated for her5+her <dig> at the mhb  <cit> . in this case, we expect that the knockdown of both genes would produce a phenotype of a greater magnitude than the ectopic expression of proneural markers in r <dig> and r <dig>  to test this possibility, we simultaneously blocked her <dig> and her8a by the co-injection of her3mo and her8amo . this produced no additional effect on neurog <dig> expression  . likewise, the co-injection of her3mo and her8amo in amounts just below their effective doses  induced no phenotype in r <dig> and r <dig> . together, these observations indicate that these two factors alone are not compensating for each other to repress neurog <dig> in other areas of the embryo.

as a final alternative hypothesis, and based on the recovery of her8a as binding to a her bhlh domain in yeast cells, we tested whether her8a and her <dig> could act as necessary heterodimerisation partners. as no commercial antibodies are available for her <dig> and her8a, and attempts by our laboratory to have them manufactured failed, we chose a co-purification approach using tagged versions of the full-length zebrafish proteins recombinantly expressed in hek293t cells. by purifying strep/flag-tagged her <dig> via its strep-tag ii moiety, myc-tagged her8a was successfully co-purified , demonstrating that both proteins interact with each other. this interaction may be relevant to the maintenance of the progenitor pools within r <dig> and r <dig>  where both her <dig> and her8a are strongly expressed, and hereby account for the identical phenotypes of her <dig> and her8a loss of function .

in the absence of her <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> activity, endogenous her8a alone is insufficient to preserve neurog1-free progenitor pools in the midbrain-hindbrain domain
the results above indicate that, although her8a is expressed across the entire mh domain, it is only strictly required to block neurogenesis in r <dig> and r <dig>  this raises the question of which her genes combination encodes the endogenous pattern of neurogenesis inhibition in the mh domain, and whether this combination involves her8a expression. to address this issue, we used double in situ hybridization to re-analyze expression of the progenitor pools genes, comparing her <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  our data confirmed the full overlap of her <dig> and her <dig>  as well as the extension of her <dig> longitudinal stripes into the presumptive mhb domain  <cit>  , and revealed a previously unreported expression of her <dig> coinciding with the antero-lateral aspects of the her5/ <dig> territory  . previous loss-of-function experiments of combinations of these genes never achieved a full neurogenic phenotype: concomitantly blocking her <dig> and her <dig> induced neurog <dig> medially but only to a lesser extent in mediolateral and lateral mhb domains  <cit>  , and the co-inhibition of her <dig> and her <dig> largely recapitulated her <dig> loss-of-function in the mh area, with a restricted induction of neurog <dig> within r <dig> and r <dig>  <cit>  . we found that the down-regulation of all four factors together, through the coinjection of the relevant gripna antisense oligonucleotides, was required to generate a large neurog1-positive domain across the presumptive mhb and r <dig>   - although the most lateral aspects of the neural plate remained neurog1-free -. in these conditions however, her8a expression remained unperturbed   . together, these results demonstrate that the endogenous activity of her8a, in the absence of other progenitor pools her factors, is insufficient to inhibit neurog <dig> expression in the mh area. her8a expression also appears insensitive to the combined expression levels of her3/5/9/ <dig> and to the neurogenic status of this neural plate domain. when following the fate of ectopic neurog1-expressing progenitors in the absence of her3/5/ <dig> and  <dig> activities, we found however that only a subset were maintained until 24hpf. these were located ventrally across the midbrain-hindbrain boundary, immediately posterior to vcc-derived neurons .

endogenous her8a expression in the early neural plate is independent of notch signaling but requires the expression of soxb factors
although many e transcription factors are downstream effectors of notch signalling, previous work has shown that zebrafish her genes expressed in progenitor pools, such as her <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  exhibit a non-canonical regulation by notch: they do not require notch for their expression, and are insensitive to or transcriptionally inhibited upon ectopic notch activation. this is in contrast to other family members such as her <dig>  that are expressed in neurogenic zones and are activated by notch signaling  <cit> .

unusually, her8a is expressed across both progenitor pools and proneural clusters in the early neural plate. to analyze the effect of ectopic notch activation, we overexpressed the intracellular domain of zebrafish notch1a   <cit>  through capped mrna injection at the one-cell stage. we could replicate previously published results  <cit>  showing that nicd misexpression completely downregulates neurogenesis throughout the early neural plate  . we found that overexpression of nicd causes ectopic or enhanced expression of her8a throughout the embryo  , although this induction was weaker at the caudal end of the neural plate . the latter observation was repeated when studying the her <dig>  target gene  , suggesting a generally lower ability of this neural plate area to respond to nicd overexpression, rather than a her8a-specific feature in notch response. next, to determine whether her8a expression depends on endogenous notch signaling, we incubated embryos between the 50% epiboly and 3-somite stages into the gamma-secretase inhibitor dapt, which blocks notch by preventing the cleavage of nicd and has a strong neurogenic effect  <cit> . as anticipated from previous studies  <cit> , dapt treatment increased the amount of neurog1-positive cells within each proneural cluster  . however, it failed to reproducibly affect the expression of her8a  . together, these results indicate that endogenous notch signaling is not required for her8a expression in the early neural plate.

in order to gain further insight into the endogenous mechanisms controlling her8a regulation at these stages, we scanned the her8a promoter  with the modelinspector program   <cit> . this revealed a potential sox  binding site  at position 873- <dig>  modelinspector uses genomatix's in-house promoter module library, which includes experimentally verified models for functional promoter subunits. in this case the promoter sequence was derived from a publication describing the activation of the mouse fgf <dig> enhancer by sox <dig> and oct- <dig>  <cit> . this led us to investigate the possibility that a member of the sox gene family is controlling her8a expression. mouse sox <dig> is a member of group b <dig>  a subdivision of sox genes involved in neural development  <cit> . within this subgroup, we focused on the zebrafish genes sox <dig>  <cit> , sox <dig>  <cit> , sox19a and sox19b  <cit>  , excluding sox1a and sox1b, which are not expressed at the mhb at early embryonic stages  <cit> . in addition, we also investigated sox21a , a member of the related subgroup b <dig> with specific mhb expression at early embryonic stages  <cit> . we found that expression of these different sox genes overlapped all or part of the her8a-positive domain at the 5-somite stage: sox <dig> and sox <dig> displayed strongest overlap with her8a expression in the anterior hindbrain  , sox21a at the mhb , while sox19a and b were intensely expressed throughout the mh . in addition, sox <dig>   <dig>  19a and 19b all displayed an expression identical to her8a in the presumptive telencephalon and ventral diencephalon, excluding the eye field . to analyze the role of these genes in controlling her8a expression, we used mos targeting their atg start site  <cit> . a single mo was used to inhibit sox <dig> and  <dig>  which share the sequence surrounding their atg. when injected individually at the one-cell stage, none of these mos produced a phenotype on her8a expression at the 3-somite stage  . however, the combined knock-down of all five sox genes at once caused reduced her8a staining in the mh area  , indicating that these factors cooperate, possibly in a dose-dependent manner, to enhance her8a expression within the early neural plate. in a reverse step, we analyzed whether these genes were linked by a positive regulatory loop. we found however that blocking her8a function upon her8amo injection had no effect on sox genes expression at the 3-somite stage  .

discussion
her8a is a neurogenesis repressor in the early zebrafish neural plate
two lines of evidence demonstrate that her8a can act as a repressor of neurogenesis: firstly, the overexpression of full-length her8a causes a complete loss of neurog <dig> expression in the early embryo; secondly, we show that morpholino-mediated knockdown of her8a causes ectopic neurog <dig> expression in rhombomeres  <dig> and  <dig>  these results are surprising, since the hes6-like factors studied to date tend to exhibit neurogenesis-promoting activity. when ectopically expressed, hes <dig> promotes neurogenesis in the xenopus embryo  <cit> , the differentiation of cortical neurons at the expense of astrocytes in the mouse  <cit> , and the differentiation of retinal precursor cells into photoreceptors in mouse retinal explants  <cit> . these activities at least in part involve functionally antagonizing hes <dig>  since it was shown that hes <dig> alone cannot bind the canonical e binding site   <cit> . rather, hes <dig> dimerises with hes <dig> and modifies its dna binding properties  <cit> , its capacity for recruiting the co-repressor groucho or its stability  <cit> . interestingly at least some of these properties appear controlled by the loop domain of hes <dig>  which is five amino acids shorter than that of other e proteins . indeed, the addition of five amino acid residues into the loop of hes <dig> confers hes1-like repressor activity on the n box, while conversely, the removal of five amino acid residues from the loop of hes <dig> completely ceases repression activity and confers hes6-like activity  <cit> . we observed that her8a has an intermediate loop-length compared to hes <dig> and hes <dig> . although the functional significance of this feature remains a matter for investigation, it is possible that it confers specific mechanistic properties to her8a that distinguish it from hes <dig> and bring it closer to the mode of action of hes1-like proteins. in addition, our phylogenetic and synteny analyses revealed the complex evolution of hes6-like genes and, contrary to previous belief, that her8a is not a direct ortholog of hes <dig>  rather, hes <dig> orthologs comprise zebrafish her <dig> and hes <dig>  both of which have the same loop length as mouse hes <dig>  we show here that zebrafish her <dig> is specifically expressed in a pattern coincident with neurogenesis  reminiscent of hes <dig> expression in the developing nervous system of both mouse and xenopus, highlighting committed progenitors or early neurons  <cit> . thus we would predict that zebrafish her <dig>  rather than her8a, shares functional properties with mammalian hes <dig>  the function of hes <dig>  subfamily proteins, to which her8a belongs, has not been thoroughly tested, largely due to their absence in mammals. in the chicken neural tube however, hes <dig>  exerts a neurogenesis promoting activity  <cit> , suggesting that hes <dig>  proteins may differ in their activities. we further propose that the splitting of her8a from locus  <dig> to a distinct genomic location  permitted the acquisition of a unique expression profile for this gene in zebrafish.

combined her activities generate the midbrain-hindbrain progenitor pool pattern through different modalities
our loss-of-function studies demonstrate that her8a activity is necessary to prevent neurogenesis within the mediolateral territory of r <dig> and  <dig>  hence keeping the proneural clusters for moto- and lateral neurons spatially separated within the anterior hindbrain. combined with the fact that endogenous her8a expression does not depend on notch at this developmental stage , this function is typical of a "pre-patterning" activity, comparable to that exhibited by the other e factors her <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> that delimit the territories competent for neurog <dig> expression within the neural plate  <cit> . despite this functional relevance, the phenotype of her8a morphants appears very restricted compared to the broad expression of her8a, which encompasses the entire mid- and anterior hindbrain . functional redundancy and dosage effects have been described for other members of the e family in the mouse neural tube  <cit>  and the zebrafish early neural plate  <cit> . for example, her <dig> and her <dig> act in an equivalent and dose-dependent manner to block neurog <dig> expression in the medial and lateral aspects of the presumptive mhb  <cit> , and her <dig> and her <dig> also cooperate to inhibit neurogenesis within the longitudinal stripe separating the presumptive moto- and interneuron clusters of the spinal cord  <cit> . we found that all her genes analyzed here  were at least partially co-expressed within the presumptive mh , strongly suggesting that redundancy may account for the normal development of this area in her8a morphants. the situation in the hindbrain, however, appears different. the only two her genes highlighting progenitor pools in r2- <dig> are her <dig> and her8a. while morphant embryos for each of these genes have an identical phenotype, our results argue against a dose-dependent mechanism involving her <dig> and her8a. indeed, we found that the co-injection of her8amo and her3mo at active doses did not produce an additional phenotype  and that, if both morpholinos were injected together in amounts just below their effective concentration, ectopic neurog <dig> expression was not observed. given that the two factors do not regulate each other's expression, these experiments suggest that the presence of each factor individually, rather than their overall dose, is relevant to maintain neurogenesis inhibition within r <dig> and r <dig>  although her8a was isolated as a binding partner for her <dig> in yeast cells, co-purification shows that the full length her8a and her <dig> proteins heterodimerise , and the overlapping expression of her8a and her <dig> makes it possible that this interaction occurs in vivo. her proteins can dimerise with a variety of partners, as also supported by our yeast two-hybrid results , and her-her heterodimers display enhanced stability over homodimers  <cit> . a parsimonious interpretation of our results is therefore that the heterodimerisation of her8a and her <dig> is required for sufficient activity of these factors in r <dig> and r <dig>  alternatively, the individual activities of her <dig> and her8a may control complementary properties necessary to maintain the progenitor pool cell state.

in spite of the high level of her8a expression across the mhb progenitor pool, the results of the present paper also identify that the decisive inhibition of neurog <dig> expression in this location is played by other factors, namely her <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  her <dig> and  <dig> were known for their dose-dependent redundant functions, accounting for neurogenesis inhibition across part of this domain  <cit> . through knocking-down all four genes, we could achieve for the first time the transformation of most of the mhb into a neurogenic domain , while leaving her8a expression intact. collectively, our findings show that the progenitor pool pattern of the midbrain and anterior hindbrain is established by the joined activities of five prepatterning e factors which act in different combination in the mhb and rhombomere domains. they also suggest that distinct mechanisms of action of these factors may be involved in these two domains.

importantly however, we observed that the massive neurogenic phenotype induced upon blocking her3/5/9/ <dig> e activities is only partially followed by neuronal differentiation . in fact, ectopic neurons are restricted to the ventrolateral aspects of the midbrain-hindbrain boundary, like upon blocking her <dig> function alone  <cit> . the corresponding progenitor population may be particularly prone to neuronal differentiation. for all other progenitors, our observations suggest the need for a further commitment event, independent of her3/5/9/ <dig> activities, to achieve neuronal differentiation following neurog <dig> induction. blocking notch signaling concomitantly to her3/5/9/ <dig> did not allow further neurogenesis progression . persistent her8a expression in this context may contribute to neurogenesis reversion, although it was not possible to evaluate this possibility as embryos blocked for the activities of all five e factors developed abnormally.

her8a expression in the early neural plate is controlled by sox transcription factors but not notch signaling
two types of her genes have been recently distinguished based on their notch response profile: those acting as notch mediators, depending on notch signaling for their expression and overexpressed upon notch activation, and "non-canonical" her genes endogenously independent of notch and repressed when notch is experimentally activated . the former class comprises zebrafish her <dig>  and her <dig>  expressed in active neurogenic domains such as proneural clusters of the early neural plate  <cit> ; the latter class is composed of her <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  expressed in progenitor pools  <cit> . our results illustrate that her8a is unusual in its expression pattern, which overlaps both proneural clusters and progenitor pools. this property is shared with its ortholog hes <dig>  in chicken  <cit> . her8a also shows a distinctive response to notch signaling among hairy/e genes within the early neural plate, since it endogenously does not depend on notch signaling but responds positively to the experimental activation of notch . in agreement with the latter observation, we could identify su binding sites in the upstream regulatory sequence of her8a. however, this potential appears not to be used within proneural clusters of the early neural plate, demonstrating that her8a is not a mediator of lateral inhibition. this is also in agreement with its uniform rather than salt-and-pepper expression profile. we found nevertheless that overexpressing her8a abolishes neurog <dig> expression even in proneural clusters where the two genes are normally co-expressed. although we cannot ascertain that high overexpression levels mimic endogenous her8a activity, one hypothesis reconciling this different information is that her8a function within proneural clusters may generally dampen neurog <dig> expression, contributing to the function of other her factors in notch-inhibited precursors, and ensuring a proper differentiation schedule in committed progenitors. although not further analyzed in this paper, we noted also that her8a expression becomes dependent on notch signaling at later developmental stages .

our analyses of her8a expression in morphant contexts for other her factors did not highlight cross-regulations, although we found several consensus n and e boxes within the  <dig> bp upstream of the her8a start site. previous work demonstrated the positive regulation of xenopus hes <dig> by proneural bhlh proteins, in particular neurogenin  <cit> . given the presence of e boxes on the her8a promoter, and the co-expression of her8a and neurog <dig> in proneural clusters, it will be interesting to test whether her8a expression is also positively controlled by proneural factors in these locations. the ngn1/hes <dig> cascade is positively reinforcing proneural activity in xenopus  <cit> , but our functional data would predict an opposite outcome for a neurog1/her8a regulation in zebrafish.

finally, our results show that the levels of her8a expression are under control of a combination of soxb <dig> and b <dig> factors  that display intense and partially overlapping expression within the anterior neural plate . in a recent study, okuda et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that soxb <dig> factors function redundantly to control several successive aspects of zebrafish nervous system development, including neural plate patterning and primary neurogenesis. although single morphants do not harbor a visible phenotype, her <dig> expression fails to be induced in quadruple soxb <dig> morphants, strongly suggesting that the four factors act redundantly to activate her <dig> transcription  <cit> . in a comparable manner, we found that individual soxb1/b <dig> morphants display no phenotype, while her8a expression is reduced in the mh domain when all five soxb1/b <dig> proteins are abolished. although we have not tested all possible knock-down combinations, and in particular did not assess the individual relevance of sox21a in the context of the quadruple knock-out for soxb <dig> proteins, these results demonstrate that her8a expression levels are under control of the activity of at least partially redundant soxb proteins. expression of these factors is an integral part of the mechanisms patterning the early embryo  <cit> , linking her8a expression with neural plate regionalization. the identification of a sox <dig> binding site within the her8a enhancer, and the fact that all soxb proteins recognize a similar binding motif in vitro, further suggests that part of this control may be direct. in support of this hypothesis, direct binding of soxb <dig> factors onto the her <dig> enhancer has been demonstrated  <cit> . like several other soxb <dig> proteins, sox21b was shown to act as a transcriptional inhibitor during dorsoventral patterning of the zebrafish gastrula  <cit>  and generally promotes neurogenesis  <cit> . it can however act as an activator in other contexts  <cit> , and its specific effect on mh neurogenesis and her genes needs to be directly evaluated. it was recently proposed that soxb <dig> transcription factors and notch cooperate through distinct mechanisms in their control of neurogenesis inhibition, including the inhibition of proneural protein activity and the transcriptional upregulation of hes/her genes, respectively  <cit> . our results and those of okuda et al.  <cit>  suggest yet another level of regulation, where soxb proteins directly control the level of expression of some her genes. whether this is limited to notch-independent contexts, such as with the regulation of her <dig> and her8a, remains to be addressed.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we identify the hairy/e transcription factor her8a as a local inhibitor of neurogenesis in the developing hindbrain. specifically, we show that her8a function, like her <dig>  <cit> , is required to generate the non-neurogenic progenitor pools normally separating the presumptive moto- and lateral neurons of r <dig> and  <dig>  we demonstrate that her8a is a binding partner for her <dig> and we propose that this interaction may be functionally relevant in r <dig> and r <dig>  we further show that her8a alone is not sufficient to inhibit neurog <dig> expression in the presumptive mhb area; this event depends, in contrast, on the combined activities of four other e factors, her <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  unlike canonical e genes, we demonstrate that her8a does not depend on notch signaling for its expression at early neural plate stages, and we identify a combination of soxb factors that together enhance her8a expression. finally, using phylogenetic analyses, we show that her8a belongs to a hes6-like subfamily that was recently lost in the mammalian lineage. this observation provides a context for the strikingly divergent functions of her8a from hes6; hes <dig>  which was previously believed to be the mammalian ortholog of her8a, displays proneural activity. together, our results characterize the phylogeny, expression and functional cascades involving a new her factor, and highlight the complex interplay of e proteins that generates the neurogenesis pattern of the zebrafish midbrain-hindbrain area.
