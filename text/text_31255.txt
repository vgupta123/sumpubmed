BACKGROUND
the nad+-dependent d-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase , which has been studied by our group for several years  <cit> , plays a key role in redox balance and energy metabolism since it reversibly converts 3-hydroxybutyrate into acetoacetate . in eukaryotic cells, bdh is a mitochondrial inner membrane-bound enzyme  <cit>  and its active site is located on the matrix side  <cit> . bdh is coded by a nuclear gene and is synthesized in free cytosolic polysomes as a precursor that is posttranslationally imported into mitochondria and then processed at its n-terminus presequence  <cit> . a very unique property, the catalytic activity of the enzyme is lecithin-dependent  <cit> . the purified bdh is nonactive in absence of lipids but can insert spontaneously and unidirectionally into liposomal-phospholipid vesicles or into purified membranes and then become catalytically active  <cit> . it has previously been proposed that specific activation of bdh by phosphatidylcholine -containing liposomes involves an allosteric mechanism  <cit>  in which pc enhances coenzyme-binding  <cit> . as reported by williamson et al.  <cit> , according to the equilibrium constant, in the presence of nadh, the hepatic bdh transforms acetoacetate into d-3-hydroxybutyrate, which is then transported through the blood stream to peripheral tissues, i.e., brain, heart, kidney, etc. in extrahepatic tissues, bdh catalyzes the reverse reaction where acetoacetate is used, after its conversion to acetyl-coa, in atp production. on the other hand, acetoacetyl-coa can be used for fatty acid synthesis. a catalytic mechanism involving cystenyl and histidyl residues of the bdh active site for the interconversion of d-3-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate in both liver and peripheral tissues has been previously proposed by our group  <cit> .

in striking contrast to mammalian bdh, the bacterial bdh is a cytosolic soluble enzyme and does not require phospholipids for its activity  <cit> . indeed, the role of bdh in many bacteria is to produce d-3-hydroxybutyrate, which is a substrate for the synthesis of poly -3-hydroxybutyrate  as intracellular carbon energy storage  <cit> .

elsewhere, our group has long been interested in the lipid metabolism of an intriguing mammalian species: the jerboa   <cit> . the jerboa is a nocturnal herbivorous rodent living mainly in morocco's subdesert highland. it is an appropriate organism to study metabolic regulation because of its remarkable tolerance to heat, cold, dryness and scarce diet. this animal is a true hibernator  <cit> , developing a seasonal obesity by accumulating fat during the prehibernation period. this fat is used during the hibernation period, together with carbohydrates, to produce energy via the formation of d-3-hydroxybutyrate by bdh  <cit> .

to further characterize bdh from jerboa, it appeared necessary to overcome its low specific activity in mitochondria by purifying the enzyme from liver of the jerboa by establishing a new and original purification technique. indeed, while bacterial bdh can be easily purified with the classical method for soluble enzymes  <cit> , enormous effort has gone into purifying the mitochondrial membrane-bound bdh from mammals, mostly from bovine heart  <cit> , rat liver  <cit> , rat brain  <cit> , recombinant rat liver enzyme expressed in escherichia coli  <cit> , and camelus liver  <cit> . typically, after membrane disruption by detergent  or by phospholipase a2-generated lysophospholipids, the purification procedures were based on combined chromatographies . unfortunately, these methods were difficult to adapt to other sources. until now, no-one has proposed an immunoaffinity purification method. here, we report the development of an antibody-antigen procedure based on the existence of conserved epitopes between bacterial and mammalian bdh. indeed, bdh from jaculus orientalis was purified using polyclonal antibodies raised against a prokaryotic bdh purified from the bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa. after solubilization of mitochondrial membranes using triton x- <dig>  purification of jerboa liver bdh was processed using ammonium sulfate precipitation and phenyl-sepharose and sepharose-blue chromatographies. final purification was achieved by immunochromatography, providing a  <dig> kda single polypeptide chain. moreover, even though the genome of jaculus orientalis has not been sequenced, a d-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase cdna from jerboa was cloned and sequenced for the first time. sequence alignment revealed conserved putative essential amino acids for nad+ interaction. this study applied immunoaffinity chromatography to purify bdh, a membrane-bound and lipid-dependent enzyme. in addition, bacterial bdh was isolated in a two-step purification procedure, providing better knowledge of a lipid metabolism enzyme in a unique hibernating mammalian species.

RESULTS
- purification of soluble bdh from pseudomonas aeruginosa
bdh was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from p. aeruginosa extract in a two-step ammonium sulfate fractionation  procedure, followed by blue sepharose cl-6b chromatography.

in a typical experiment, a total amount of  <dig> mg of protein, corresponding to  <dig> units of bdh, was obtained from crude extract of p. aeruginosa. after ammonium sulfate fractionation, the concentrated enzyme solution was applied to a blue sepharose cl-6b column. a specific activity of  <dig>  u/mg of protein was obtained for the purified enzyme, with a yield of  <dig> % and a purification factor of  <dig> .

the sds-page analysis of the different fractions obtained during this purification shows only one protein band at  <dig> kda in the final enzyme preparation .

using purified bdh as the immunogen, we produced rabbit polyclonal antibodies, which selectively recognize a single immunoreactive band  in both crude extracts and purified preparations .

the polyclonal antibodies produced were purified and fixed to cn-br sepharose in order to purify the bdh from jerboa liver.

- purification of membrane-bound bdh from jerboa liver
in a typical trial, a total of  <dig> mg of protein, corresponding to  <dig>  units of bdh, was obtained after solubilization of mitoplast proteins using triton x- <dig> as nonionic surfactant. after ammonium sulfate fractionation, the concentrated enzyme solution was applied to phenyl-sepharose hp, blue sepharose cl-6b, and immunoaffinity columns. table  <dig> summarizes the results of the purification process. a specific activity of  <dig>  u/mg of protein was obtained for the purified enzyme, with a yield of  <dig> % and a purification factor of  <dig> 

typical experiments were reported from three independent trials.

* the ammonium sulphate precipitation step eliminates 91% of contaminating proteins from jerboa crude extracts, respectively. these values were calculated from the total protein amount deduced from the amount of bdh .

the sds-page analysis shows that the immunoaffinity step is crucial to eliminate the remaining contaminants of the penultimate fractions. this last purification step shows a single  <dig> kda protein , which has been described for other eukaryotic bdh subunits . the  <dig> kda jerboa bdh monomer cross-reacts with the purified antibacterial bdh antibodies .

- properties of the purified bdh from jerboa liver
bdh kinetic parameters of purified bdh from jerboa liver in liposome-reconstituted phospholipid-enzyme complex were determined. the results obtained show a value of  <dig> nmol/min/mg for vmax,  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  mm, and  <dig>  mm for kmnad+, kmboh and kdnad+, respectively. the comparison of these values with the parameters of the native bdh bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane  <cit>  shows small differences in the km values. this can be explained by the fact that the purified bdh released from its mitochondrial membrane environment was successfully reconstituted in an active form following addition of mitochondrial phospholipids.

the effect of temperature on the bdh activity was followed. the results obtained show that the optimal temperature for the bdh activity is 35°c for j. orientalis . this is close to 37°c for bdh from camelus dromedaries  <cit>  but very different  for microbial bdh from acidovorax  <cit> .

interestingly, like membrane-bound enzyme, the arrhenius plots of the reconstituted active purified bdh show a break at 17°c . bdh activity dependence on temperature discontinuity was previously found for native bdh in the heavy mitochondria fraction from jerboa liver  <cit> . this property is considered to reflect that bdh lipids depend on the physical state of the membrane phospholipid bilayer.

the optimal ph value of bdh activity is  <dig> . similar results were found for rat  <cit> , camelus dromedaries  <cit> , and for the bacteria acidovorax, rhodospirillum rubrum and rhodopseudomonas spheroides  <cit> .

- nucleotide sequence and analysis of j. orientalis bdh cdna
in order to clone the cdna encoding bdh from jerboa liver, rt-pcr, primers were selected from two highly conserved bdh regions  from mammalian species since the jerboa genome has not yet been sequenced. for the nucleotide sequence, see the section titled "method" section. the amplification procedure revealed a single cdna fragment with the expected size  . the sequenced clone  was aligned and compared with other bdhs, from several species, including the mammalian vertebrate phyla and bacterial species, using the bioedit program  <cit> . the highest identity was shown when the sequence was aligned with other mammalian bdh sequences . indeed, the analysis shown in figure  <dig> reveals 79% identity with rat and mouse, 75% with human and only 19% with p. aeruginosa. jerboa bdh sequence is 92% complete since amino acids from the c-terminal side are not yet available. the differences in sequences obtained between mammalian and bacterial bdhs can be related to the biochemical properties of both enzymes since mammalian bdh is membrane-bound and located in mitochondria and bacterial bdh is soluble and cytosolic. moreover, the comparison between the two bdh types in terms of cdna-deduced sequences reveals the major difference in the length of the polypeptide chain:  <dig> amino acids for the human bdh vs  <dig> for pseudomonas. the longer sequence of the mammalian enzyme is related to the mitochondrial targeting presequence at the n-terminus and to the phospholipid-binding region at the c-terminus   <cit> . the sequence alignment shows  <dig> identical amino acids and  <dig> similar amino acids between the mammalian and the bacterial enzymes.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
purifying bdh from jerboa liver made it possible to overcome its low specific activity in mitochondria for further biochemical characterization of the enzyme.

previous bdh purification procedures, partial or complete, were successively proposed by different groups in order to improve the purity, the stability, the yield, the time required or simplicity, and to adapt the technique to bdh from various mammalian sources. the purification procedures were often based on several chromatography steps by combining adsorption, hydrophobic, ionic exchange, or nad+ . the published procedures were not convenient to jerboa liver bdh purification. for instance, rat liver  <cit>  and bovine heart  <cit>  bdh was not pure and/or contained significant amounts of residual phospholipids. the technique developed in fleischer's lab  <cit> , using controlled pore glass beads , was adapted for large-scale use and required a huge amount of starting biological material but provided a low yield .

our new procedure was based on the use of polyclonal antibodies raised against bdh from bacterial pseudomonas aeruginosa. after purification steps using phenyl sepharose and blue-sepharose, jerboa liver bdh fractions were not pure to homogeneity and required an immunoaffinity column to achieve purification, yielding  <dig> %.

the molecular weight of the purified jerboa bdh subunit  shows a similar value to the values given for most of the eukaryotic bdh, e.g., for bovine heart  <cit> , rat liver  <cit>  and human heart  <cit> . in contrast, bdh from camelus dromedaries shows a molecular weight of  <dig> kda  <cit> , possibly corresponding to an evolutionary duplicated form. the primary sequence of bdh was previously determined for rat liver  <cit>  and human heart enzyme  <cit> .

the purified jerboa liver bdh from the bdh-antibody complex is in a readily reactivating form, since the active bdh-mitochondrial phospholipid complex shows similar enzymatic parameters as the native mitochondrially bound bdh, i.e., similar kinetic parameters, a break in the arrhenius plot, optimum ph, and optimum temperature.

while the sequenced genome of jaculus orientalis is not available, for the first time a bdh cdna from jerboa has been cloned and sequenced. from: this and from the purified protein we assume that both correspond to the same molecular entity despite the fact that two kinetically different bdh enzymes were revealed in heavy and light mitochondria fromm jerboa liver  <cit> . sequence alignment revealed putative essential amino acids for the nad+ interaction. the full identification and the spatial position of bdh strategic amino acids could not be achieved with a mammalian bdh since no 3d-structure is thus far available despite a number of attempts to obtain crystals . the available structural data are related to the structure of the bacterial bdh of pseudomonas fragi . based on the pseudomonas fragi bdh structure, modeling has revealed that conserved amino acids are closely localized to the bdh active site <cit> . this analysis highlights the importance of these amino acids in the enzyme reaction, especially the strictly conserved tetrad: asn <dig>  ser <dig>  tyr <dig> and lys <dig> . in addition, ito et al.  <cit>  reported that the adenine of nad+ is accommodated in the hydrophobic pocket including gly <dig>  leu <dig>  ala <dig>  ile <dig> and leu <dig> . all these residues were also found in the bdh sequences studied .

this study applied immunoaffinity chromatography to purifying bdh, a membrane-bound and lipid-dependent enzyme. in addition, bacterial bdh isolation was achieved in a two-step purification procedure. this method also improved the knowledge of a lipid metabolism enzyme in a unique hibernating mammal.
