BACKGROUND
l. amazonensis are protozoan parasites belonging to the trypanosomatidae family. in natural settings, the l. amazonensis perpetuation relies on blood-feeding sand fly and rodent hosts. the development of promastigotes proceeds within the gut lumen of the sand fly hosts and ends with metacyclic promastigotes. the latter, once delivered into the mammal dermis, differentiate as amastigotes mainly within the resident dermal macrophage  acting as bona fide host cells. following the parasite inoculation and before the development of the more or less transient skin damages that characterize cutaneous leishmaniasis there is an asymptomatic phase lasting for several days or weeks during which the intracellular amastigote progeny expands. this expansion takes place within a compartment named parasitophorous vacuole  that displays properties similar to late endosomes/lysosomes and the size of which grows significantly for leishmania belonging to the mexicana complex  <cit> . in this study we sought to analyze the transcriptional signatures of a homogeneous population of mΦ derived in vitro from balb/c mouse bone marrow csf- <dig> dependent progenitors and hosting amastigotes that are actively multiplying. the affymetrix genechip technology was used to compare the gene expression profiles of l. amazonensis amastigotes-hosting bone marrow-derived mΦ and parasite-free ones. this in vitro transcriptomics approach was combined with the ingenuity biological network analysis to highlight the mouse mΦ biological processes the multiplying l. amazonensis amastigotes rely on within their giant communal pv. our findings suggest that mΦ hosting multiplying amastigotes contribute to carve a parasite-as well as a host tissue-protective environment.

RESULTS
l. amazonensis amastigotes subvert mΦ as host cells where they enter a cell-cycling phase lasting several days . we compared the transcriptomes of amastigote-free mΦ and amastigote-harbouring mΦ  <dig> h after the uptake of amastigotes carefully purified from nude mouse lesions. at this time-point amastigotes were multiplying within a huge pv  and their population size had almost doubled . among the  <dig>  probe-sets of the mouse430_ <dig> genechip,  <dig>   were displaying features of differential expression at the 5% significance level . of these,  <dig>  matched ingenuity pathway analysis database version  <dig> . <dig> which represented  <dig> genes with a known function. about 80% of these genes were incorporated into either ingenuity's canonical pathway or biological network . the symbols of the modulated genes are specified in the text , while their full names are given in additional file  <dig>  furthermore, comparable fc values were obtained between the affymetrix technology and the real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction  method   <cit> .

this table is an excerpt from the table of the  <dig>  significantly modulated probe-sets, available as online additional file  <dig>  and contains some genes tested by rtqpcr.

a when several probe-sets detect a target gene, data are only shown for the most modulated one. nm: no modulation significantly detected with affymetrix technology. ns: not significant p-value. b mean values obtained from the raw fluorescence intensities.

though transcriptional changes due to the phagocytic uptake process per se – known to occur mostly within the first  <dig> hours post particle addition – cannot be completely excluded, the mΦ transcript modulation – detected at  <dig> h post the amastigote addition – very likely reflects mΦ reprogramming due to the presence of cell cycling amastigotes within giant pv. indeed, in our experimental conditions, no extracellular amastigotes could be evidenced in the mΦ culture  after a brief centrifugation step and  one hour contact with adherent mΦ indicating that the phagocytic uptake of l. amazonensis amastigotes is a rapid and efficient process. furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the size of the amastigote population hosted within the mΦ pv rapidly expands within the first  <dig> h   <cit> . using also mouse bone marrow-derived mΦ as host cells for leishmania, gregory and coworkers demonstrated that the gene expression profiles of control mΦ and mΦ that have phagocytosed latex beads  <dig> h before were very similar. they evidenced a statistically significant difference for only  <dig> probe sets. none of the  <dig> corresponding probe sets in the mouse  <dig> dna affymetrix gene chip was present in the list of  <dig> modulated probe sets observed in presence of l. amazonensis amastigotes. thus, these data strongly support our conclusion that the gene expression profile observed  <dig> h after the phagocytosis of l. amazonensis amastigotes was due to the presence of intracellular cell-cycling parasites.

l. amazonensis amastigotes set up an optimal sub cellular niche
modulation of mΦ genes encoding vacuolar proton atpase sub-units
within their host cells, l. amazonensis amastigotes are known to multiply efficiently in the acidic environment of the mΦ pv  <cit> . in presence of amastigotes, we observed an up-regulation of the gene expression of eight isoforms of the v <dig> and v <dig> sub-units of the mΦ vacuolar proton atpase   <cit> . this could contribute to the sustained acidification of the pv lumen which has been shown to be important at least for the optimal amastigote nutrient acquisition  <cit> .

coordinated modulation of mΦ lipid metabolism
the most relevant biological networks fitting our dataset were strongly associated to the function "lipid metabolism", the most significant canonical metabolic pathway being "biosynthesis of steroids" . indeed, several up-regulated genes  were involved i) in cholesterol uptake , ii) in cholesterol transport  and iii) in sterol biosynthesis . worth is mentioning the most up-regulated gene encoding type ii deiodinase , an enzyme converting intracellular thyroxin  to tri-iodothyronine , the more active form of thyroid hormone. it has previously been demonstrated in mouse hepatocytes that the molecular basis for the connection of t <dig> and cholesterol metabolism involves the master transcriptional activator of the aforementioned genes, namely srebf <dig>  the promoter of which contains a thyroid hormone response element  <cit> . furthermore, thyroid hormone receptors can activate transcription of target genes upon t <dig> binding and this could be facilitated by co-activators ncoa <dig>  and brd <dig> . interestingly, opposite to dio <dig>  the most down-regulated gene was cholesterol-25-hydrolase , an enzyme acting downstream this pathway by breaking down cholesterol and by synthesizing a co-repressor of srebf <dig> transcriptional activation  <cit> . upstream this pathway, several up-regulated genes involved in glycolysis could also contribute to increase the supply of acetate . of note was the down-regulation of genes encoding enzymes competing i) with hmgcs <dig> for acetate  and ii) with aldoa and aldoc for fructose, 1- <dig>  biphosphate, which is needed to produce glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate upstream the sterol biosynthesis pathway . in addition, the up-regulation of the transcription factor encoded by atf <dig>  was consistent with the down-modulation of fbp <dig>  these data suggest that the available intracellular pool of sterol-synthesis molecular intermediates was maintained by a gene expression program relying on a coordinated regulation at both the transcriptional level by srebf <dig>  atf <dig>  and atf <dig>  and also most likely at the post-transcriptional level by insig <dig>  encoding a sterol-sensing protein that regulates the intracellular cholesterol level  <cit> .

the expression of several genes involved in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway was also up-regulated with the modulation of ppap2b , scd <dig> , scd <dig>  and acsl <dig> . moreover, genes encoding fatty acid binding proteins that play a role in fatty acid uptake and transport were up-regulated . extracellular lipolysis was down-modulated , while intracellular catabolism of triglycerides mediated via mgll was up-regulated . fatty acid transport to peroxisome was diminished with abcd <dig> down-modulation . since this was not described neither for l. major nor l. donovani  <cit> , this could be unique for the l. mexicana complex, all sub-species of which multiply within giant communal pv  <cit> . indeed, previous experimental work performed with l. mexicana  <cit> , which is very close to l. amazonensis , has shown that amastigotes could take advantage of the mΦ sterol biosynthesis pathway to produce ergosterol.

these data were in agreement with the sterol biosynthesis machinery of the mΦ host cell being exploited by the cell-cycling amastigotes for both their own cell membrane sterols, in particular ergosterol and the pv membrane sterol-dependent remodelling. indeed, cholesterol availability might play a role in the formation of the pv lipid rafts  <cit>  that could be involved in the control of fusion events leading to the sustained remodelling of the huge communal pv membrane where the aforementioned proton pump components are regularly delivered.

modulation of mΦ polyamine metabolism
polyamines  derived from arginine catabolism are essential compounds for amastigote growth  <cit> . using the affymetrix technology we failed to detect, at the 5% significance threshold, arginase- <dig>  and ornithine decarboxylase- <dig> , two enzymes leading to the formation of polyamines through arginine catabolism. indeed, while for arg <dig> the raw fluorescence intensity values were below or close to the background level, for odc <dig> the raw fluorescence intensities before data processing displayed only a slight increase  in presence of amastigotes . however, the up-regulation of slc7a <dig>  in mΦ hosting amastigotes was a strong incentive for monitoring the abundance of arg <dig> and odc <dig> transcripts with a validated rtqpcr method. using this method we did detect a slight variation of the expression of arg <dig>  and odc <dig>  . therefore, in presence of amastigotes, arg <dig> could favour arginine transformation into ornithine, the latter being catalyzed in turn by odc <dig> to generate putrescine .

odc1-antizyme plays a role in the regulation of polyamine synthesis by binding to and inhibiting odc <dig>  the transcript abundance of azin <dig> encoding odc1-antizyme inhibitor- <dig> was higher  when amastigotes were present, so that this inhibitor might prevent antizyme-mediated odc <dig> degradation. of note, ornithine could also be generated from proline by p4ha <dig> , and putrescine from spermine and spermidine by the successive action of sat <dig>  and maoa . spermidine synthase  and spermine synthase , two enzymes catalyzing the reverse reactions leading to the formation of spermine from putrescine, were not detected with affymetrix , although their transcript abundance decreased in presence of amastigotes . no gene expression modulation was detected with affymetrix for nos <dig>  that encodes a competing enzyme for arginine substrate leading to the production of microbe-targeting nitric oxide derivatives , and only a slight up-regulation was detected with rtqpcr  . the present data further extend former observations  <cit> , and highlight a coordinated gene expression modulation that sustains a metabolic flux leading to the biosynthesis of putrescine from arginine and proline via ornithine, and from spermine and spermidine.

l. amazonensis amastigotes set up an optimal dermis niche
decreased expression of genes involved in the entry of non leishmanial micro-organisms as well as in the sensing and processing of microbial molecules
several genes involved in classical and alternate complement component pathways were down-regulated  as well as some genes of the toll-like receptor signalling pathway . these pathways are known to contribute to the entry of micro-organisms and the sensing/processing of microbial molecules. in presence of the intracellular cell-cycling amastigotes these biological processes would be restricted, if not prevented. indeed, it is conceivable that non-leishmania micro-organisms or microbial molecules might trigger a different mΦ transcriptional program that could interfere with the one already set up by l. amazonensis amastigotes for their multiplication. nevertheless, it has recently been demonstrated that the other l. amazonensis developmental stage, the promastigote, was still able to enter mΦ already hosting amastigotes, to transform into amastigote and to multiply efficiently within the pv  <cit> .

the above data suggested that l. amazonensis amastigotes were able to control mΦ expression of the early complement components, the proteolytic products of which are known to be pro-inflammatory. this complement component pathway down-modulation was also recently described for human mΦ housing l. major parasites  <cit> . the down-modulation of the toll-like receptor pathway also suggested prevention of the inflammatory process signalling. at this stage, although some anti-inflammatory genes were not up-modulated  the gene expression modulation for the majority of the listed genes involved in inflammatory processes showed that the presence of cell-cycling amastigotes imposed an immune unbalance favouring the shaping of a counter-inflammatory and safe dermis niche for these parasites .

decreased expression of genes involved in the chemokine-dependent mΦ traffic
the down-modulation of the expression of genes encoding chemokine receptors  suggested that amastigote-harbouring mΦ were less responsive to chemo-attractant gradients and thus less amenable to enter into the afferent lymphatics. this is consistent with the dominant residence of l. amazonensis-hosting mΦ in the skin. in favour of this possible reduced emigration of mΦ from the dermis niche was the down-regulation of itga <dig>  encoding an integrin shown to contribute to the lymphatic adhesion/transmigration  <cit> . it is beyond the scope of this article to discuss about more than a dozen of chemokine receptor ligands the gene expression of which was modulated . indeed, the interpretation is not that straightforward because of the complexity of their partial overlapping functions and/or common receptors.

decreased expression of genes involved in the cellular communication with leukocytes prone to display parasite-damaging functions
the modulation of several transcripts indicated a prevention of mΦ communication with leukocytes that could be rapidly recruited such as nk lymphocytes, and t-lymphocytes. for instance, h <dig> is one of the ligand able to efficiently activate nk-lymphocytes by binding to the nkg2d receptor . in presence of amastigotes, the h <dig> mΦ expression was down-modulated , suggesting the prevention of this "immune synapse" by which parasitized mΦ and nk lymphocytes can communicate. interestingly, nkg2d receptor engagement by h <dig> ligand in mΦ, that normally leads to the production of mΦ leishmanicidal molecules such as no and tnf-α  <cit> , could be impaired in mΦ hosting amastigotes since the expression of klrk <dig> gene was also down-modulated . besides, the gene expression of the co-stimulatory molecule cd <dig> was reduced , while that of the inhibitory receptor cd <dig>  was increased . in addition, the transcript abundance of the co-stimulatory molecules icam <dig> , icam <dig>  and lfa- <dig>  was also reduced. the down-modulation of several genes involved in antigen presentation by mhc class ii molecules was recently discussed for human mΦ housing l. major parasites  <cit> . this data suggested plausible reduced effectiveness of this other "immune synapse" involving tcr-dependent signalling by which mΦ and t-lymphocytes can communicate. consistent with this was the reduced transcription level in mΦ hosting l. amazonensis amastigotes of h-2ma  and of ifngr <dig>  that encodes the receptor for ifnγ, a cytokine secreted by both activated nk- and t-lymphocytes and involved upstream the mhc class ii gene up-regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
the affymetrix genechip technology has allowed – for many cell lineages – the global analysis of several thousand transcripts simultaneously to be carried out in a robust fashion  <cit> . the remarkable coordination of gene expression as well as coherent biological interaction networks displayed by mΦ subverted as host cells by the multiplying l. amazonensis amastigotes allow highlighting the power of this technology at two different levels:  the amastigote-hosting mΦ transcriptional features per se and  the features of mΦ hosting cell-cycling amastigotes which would have been captured within the dermal environment. further in vivo quantitative analysis will have to be set up for validating or not the present transcriptional profile at early stage after the first wave of amastigote multiplication in the ear dermis of naïve balb/c mice. overall, the gene expression profile of mΦ hosting amastigotes did not strictly fall into either of the mΦ "activation" profiles, as it was also the case for l. chagasi  <cit> . nevertheless, consistent with the multiplication of the amastigote developmental stage, some overlap with features of the alternative mΦ activation could be observed, such as the up-regulation of arg <dig> and il1rn, and the down-regulation of cd <dig> .

in addition to the conversion of the mΦ arginine metabolism from a parasite-damaging pathway to a parasite-supportive one, the most clear-cut and novel output of the present analysis was the up-regulation of the mΦ fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. coupled to the polyamine biosynthesis the mΦ lipids could not only be a source of nutrients for the amastigotes but could also contribute to the pv unique membrane features  <cit> . lipids could not only influence the pv membrane curvature but also coordinate the recruitment and retention of key protein export to the pv where multiplying amastigotes are known to be attached  <cit> . this makes it conceivable that the multiplying amastigotes could take up trophic resources and sense non-trophic signals.

we have highlighted a promising set of transcripts accounting for the balb/c mouse macrophage reprogrammed as cell-cycling amastigote hosting cells. we do not ignore that transcript modulation changes revealed by microarray analysis could be uncoupled to changes revealed by proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis. we did not explore how these mrna changes manifest at the level of the proteome but the present genomewide data will provide a unique resource  against which to compare any proteomic/phosphoproteomic data  to allow identifying novel small compounds displaying static or cidal activity towards cell-cycling amastigotes hosted within the macrophage pv. indeed the readout assay we designed allows high content imaging in real time of  the amastigotes  the amastigotes-hosting pv as well as the macrophages per se  <cit>  and can be up-scaled for high throughput screening of small compound libraries.
