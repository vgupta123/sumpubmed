BACKGROUND
inherited developmental diseases can cause severe animal welfare and economic problems in dairy cattle breeding. where a limited number of sires are used for artificial insemination , recessive genetic defects can rapidly enrich in cattle populations. examples include degenerative axonopathy in tyrolean grey cattle  <cit>  and compromised growth and regulation of the inflammatory response in belgian blue cattle  <cit> . we recently reported foetal growth retardation and stillbirth in half the progeny of an ayrshire bull carrying a genetic deletion in the mimt <dig> gene  <cit> . identification of the causative mutation and development of a gene test enable such carrier animals to be excluded from breeding.

in the past few years, an increasing number of finnish ayrshire calves have been identified with a combination of severe symptoms including ptosis, intellectual disability, retarded growth and mortality, a disorder classified as pirm syndrome. bovine pirm resembles the human autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome, also known as blepharophimosis-ptosis-intellectual disability syndrome , caused by ubiquitin protein ligase e3b  mutations .

ube3b belongs to the family of ubiquitin e <dig> ligases involved in protein ubiquitination, a post-translational protein regulation pathway that plays a key role in several biological processes during organogenesis and neurodevelopment. mutations of other e <dig> ligases are associated with a variety of human developmental diseases. increased copy number of the huwe <dig> gene  causes cognitive impairment in males   <cit> . missense mutations in cbl  cause impaired growth, developmental delay, cryptorchidism and predisposition to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia  <cit> . the best known example of these defects is angelman syndrome characterised by intellectual disability, absence of speech, motor dysfunction and seizures  caused by loss of function of the imprinted gene ube3a   <cit> .

here we report that pirm syndrome  in cattle is associated with an exon skipping mutation in ube3b and this mutation is present at high frequency in the sample of ai bulls tested. moreover, our data suggest an association between the recently identified ah <dig> haplotype  <cit>  and pirm. our findings have practical implications for cattle breeding and provide a new model for human kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome.

RESULTS
pirm syndrome in the ayrshire population
farmers and breeding counsellors have reported an increasing number of calves with developmental defects including ptosis, post-natal growth retardation and increased juvenile mortality in the finnish ayrshire population between  <dig> and  <dig>  some affected calves also suffered from feeding problems, minor structural changes of the head and muscular hypotonia . many affected calves failed to thrive and died at a very young age if not euthanized before. breeders also reported learning difficulties indicating intellectual disability. for example calves had difficulties learning how to use feeding buckets. surviving calves required special care during the neonatal period and later showed growth retardation. usually, farmers culled affected animals before breeding. both sexes were equally affected. the phenotype has been defined as pirm syndrome according to its typical features . the analysis of pedigree records of affected animals and their close relatives indicated an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.figure  <dig> 
phenotypic manifestation of pirm syndrome. most obvious facial feature in pirm-syndrome is the ptosis. abnormal large upper eye lid gives a characteristic appearance to affected animals, almost like they were constantly sleepy . affected animals also suffered also from hypotonia  or were smaller than other age matched calves . in addition owners reported problems with learning and dependency of special care. all animals were euthanized soon after the pictures were taken.



pirm syndrome maps to a 713 kb segment on bovine chromosome 17
to identify the genomic region associated with pirm syndrome, nine affected and  <dig> unaffected calves descended from one ai bull were genotyped with a bovine high-density genotyping array. after quality control, genotypes for  <dig>  snps were phased using beagle's hidden markov model based algorithm. the haplotypes obtained were then used in a genome wide association study. a sliding window-based approach was used to compare haplotype frequency in cases and controls, which revealed a strong association on bovine chromosome  <dig> . the most significant association  resulted from four adjacent haplotype windows located between  <dig> ,074 bp and  <dig> ,740 bp. to narrow down the associated region, the genotypes of affected animals were screened for segments of homozygosity. a common 713 kb region  with extended homozygosity was present in all affected animals while none of the unaffected animals showed homozygosity, suggesting a recessive pattern of inheritance. the risk haplotype encompasses  <dig> genes .figure  <dig>

a synonymous mutation in ube3b coincides exactly with pirm syndrome
to identify the underlying mutation responsible for pirm, the whole genomes of an obligate carrier and one of its affected progeny were sequenced to average read depths of  <dig>  and  <dig> . sequence depth analysis across the 713 kb haplotype did not reveal large structural elements in the pirm associated region . to help identify candidate causal mutations, we used re-sequencing data from  <dig> previously sequenced fleckvieh animals  <cit> . there is no evidence that the pirm syndrome occurs in breeds other than ayrshire. thus, the mutation causing the pirm syndrome should not segregate among the sequenced fleckvieh animals. multi-sample variant calling in the 713 kb segment of extended homozygosity yielded genotypes for  <dig> polymorphic sites . among these only four snps were compatible with recessive inheritance that is homozygous for the reference allele in  <dig> fv animals, heterozygous in the carrier bull and homozygous for the non-reference allele in the affected animal. the functional effects of those variants were predicted based on annotation of the umd <dig>  bovine genome assembly  <cit> . one of the four compatible variants was intergenic, two were located in intronic regions of trpv <dig> and ube3b, and one variant was located in the coding region of ube3b  . however, two of the four variants  segregated also among  <dig> non-fleckvieh animals that were sequenced in the context of the  <dig> bull genomes project  <cit>  and can be therefore excluded as being causative. in conclusion, only a coding and an intronic variant of the ube3b gene segregate with the pirm syndrome.table  <dig>

we annotated the bovine ube3b gene and found that it consists of  <dig> exons, of which exons  <dig> to  <dig> are non-coding . variant rs <dig> is a g > a polymorphism in the third base of codon  <dig> that would appear to cause a synonymous substitution, p.e692e in exon  <dig> of ube3b. the rs <dig> polymorphism was validated by sanger sequencing in the carrier bull, its nine affected and  <dig> unaffected descendants. in addition, nine new cases and two control animals were also genotyped by a kasp genotyping assay. all  <dig> affected animals were homozygous for the rs <dig> a variant, whereas the unaffected animals were either heterozygous or wild type . the suspected carrier bull and  <dig> of its descendants were heterozygous.

incidence of the rs <dig> a variant in ai bulls
to determine the frequency of the rs <dig> a variant in the finnish ayrshire population we analysed  <dig> ai bulls and found a  <dig> % carrier frequency. assuming random mating, this would generate one affected calf per  <dig> offspring. of those tested,  <dig> ai bulls had a known haplotype status for ah <dig>  the ah <dig> haplotype was perfectly associated with the rs <dig> a mutation in this cohort: all  <dig> bulls that were carriers of the rs <dig> a mutation carry also the ah <dig> and  <dig> wild type bulls did not have the ah <dig> 

the rs <dig> a mutation affects splicing of ube3b
the rs <dig> g > a polymorphism is located at the junction of exon  <dig> and intron  <dig>  and could therefore affect rna splicing. the effect of the mutation on ube3b splicing was investigated by rt-pcr in samples of cerebral cortex, tectum, hippocampus, cerebellum, lung, liver, heart, kidney, spleen, and ovary from three affected and two unaffected animals, using two primer pairs. primer pair  <dig> , which flanked exon  <dig>  resulted in the amplification of two fragments from the affected animals and only one fragment from the unaffected animals . sequencing of the smaller rt-pcr product revealed in-frame exon  <dig> skipping. the other fragment of expected size corresponded to the reference sequence  with the exception of the rs <dig> a variant that was detected in affected animals.figure  <dig>

the ube3b gene was expressed in all examined tissues and the altered splicing pattern was observed in all tissues of affected animals, excluding tissue specificity. rt-pcr data obtained with primer pair  <dig> suggested lower relative expression levels of ube3b in affected animals, but rt-pcr results obtained with primer pair  <dig>  that flanked exons 27– <dig> showed no difference between unaffected and affected animals .

in silico analysis predicts in-frame deletion of  <dig> amino acids
amino acid alignment of the normal and mutated proteins showed that loss of exon  <dig> results in an in-frame deletion of  <dig> amino acids between residues 652– <dig>  deleting  <dig> amino acids from the e <dig> binding subdomain of hect in ube3b . three-dimensional modelling of the mutated hect domain revealed a lack of one α-helix structure and considerable structural differences compared to the normal hect domain .

discussion
we report a new congenital developmental syndrome in the ayrshire breed and indicate its association with an exon skipping mutation in the ube3b gene. the complex disease phenotype is characterized by ptosis, intellectual disability, retarded growth and mortality, and named pirm accordingly. genetic analyses based on across-breed comparisons efficiently shortlisted the number of candidate causative variants and ultimately identified an in-frame exon skipping mutation in ube3b. similar genetic comparisons approaches recently enabled the rapid identification of disease-causing alleles in cattle  <cit> . exon skipping results in a partial truncation of the hect-domain in the ube3b protein, likely compromising its function.

loss-of-function mutations in ube3b cause severe neurodevelopmental disorders in humans such as developmental delay, intellectual disability and characteristic facial dysmorphisms, e.g., ptosis, blepharophimosis and telecanthus. affected individuals also suffer from severe growth retardation, hypotonia, microcephaly, neonatal respiratory distress, difficulties with feeding and gastrointestinal tract and hypocholesterolemia . mice engineered to lack ube3b expression  display severe growth retardation and significant reduction of total cholesterol and lathosterol. additionally, increased embryonal and perinatal lethality was reported for ube3b-/- mice  <cit> . strikingly similar pathological signs were observed in pirm ayrshire cattle. ube3b mutations in heterozygous form do not cause any clinically detectable symptoms in cattle, which accords with studies in human and mouse.

the functional role of ube3b in different biochemical pathways is still unknown. our rt-pcr results show that, as in human  <cit>  and mouse  <cit> , bovine ube3b is expressed in several tissues. earlier results show that ube3b is involved in protein degradation under stress conditions. ube3b mrna expression was found to be up-regulated in damaged areas of chicken inner ear after noise trauma  <cit>  and the ube3b orthologue oxi- <dig> in c. elegans is associated with oxidative stress-response  <cit> . increased sensitivity toward oxidative stress might be associated with neuronal dysfunction  <cit> . in addition ube3b is connected with total cholesterol in plasma  <cit>  and importantly ube3b lesions in human and mouse are associated with hypocholesterolemia  <cit> . cholesterol is essential for normal development. decreased cholesterol synthesis might be particularly harmful to the brain, which cannot utilize circulating cholesterol because of the blood–brain barrier  <cit> .

both wild type and mutated transcripts are expressed in pirm-affected animals. this is most likely due to ineffective splicing. similar in-frame exon skipping mutations have been found in other developmental disorders, such as anophthalmia/microphthalmia  <cit> , cholesteryl ester storage disease  <cit>  and dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa  <cit> . bioinformatic analysis predicted that the mutated ube3b protein lacks  <dig> amino acids, including  <dig> in the n-terminal e <dig> subdomain of the highly conserved hect-domain. hect domains consist of two subdomains, the large n-terminal subdomain which contains the e <dig> binding site, and the small c-terminal subdomain that harbours the catalytic cys residue required for ubiquitin transfer to the substrate. the e <dig> binding site mediates the interaction with the cognate e <dig> ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme.

cooper et al.  <cit>  recently reported a segment with homozygous haplotype deficiency on bovine chromosome  <dig>  in ayrshire cattle, which encompasses the rs <dig> polymorphism. in our study, the rs <dig> a mutation was perfectly associated with ah <dig>  our findings suggest that in-frame exon skipping in ube3b might be connected to the lack of ah <dig> homozygous animals. missing homozygosity for ah <dig> could be associated with juvenile mortality, growth retardation and developmental disorders of pirm-affected calves. reduced fertility in ah <dig> carrier matings  <cit>  additionally could imply embryonic losses that agree with findings of ube3b deficiency in mice  <cit> . the estimated frequency of the ah <dig> haplotype was 26% in the us ayrshire herd  <cit>  even higher than the cohort we examined, and thus a matter of considerable concern to cattle breeders and ranchers. our study does however provide an avenue for further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
we showed here that bovine pirm syndrome, which resembles human kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome, is associated with a ube3b mutation. the ubiquitin/proteosome system  regulates many cellular signalling pathways such as the notch and hedgehog that play a key role in neurogenesis  <cit> . therefore, deregulation of ups can affect neuronal function and lead to neurological disorders  <cit> . our data support the importance of ube3b protein for normal development in mammals. moreover, pirm syndrome is the first inherited disease of the ubiquitin-dependent pathway identified in cattle. the bovine pirm model could provide the basis for comparative studies with mouse and human.

the rs <dig> a mutation was found in  <dig> % of analysed ayrshire ai bulls and is probably associated with the prevalent ah <dig> haplotype and therefore can cause serious economic problems for breeders and animal welfare problems if ai carrier bulls are used for breeding.
