BACKGROUND
post-translational modifications  are crucial mechanisms in cellular regulation. many proteins can be modified with small chemical groups or proteins in order to alter their interactions or function for a particular cellular outcome. studying post-translational modifications provide details for intricacies of protein function and response to various external or internal stimuli.

neddylation is a highly dynamic and reversible post-translational modification, in which nedd <dig> protein is covalently attached to a target lysine residue.

nedd <dig>  which is one of the ten neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally down regulated  genes, encodes the ubiquitin-like modifier of the same name in humans. nedd <dig> protein shows ~60% sequence identity with ubiquitin, and it is the most similar protein to ubiquitin among other ubiquitin-like modifiers   <cit> . in addition to sequence identity, nedd <dig> conjugation pathway is also similar to that of the ubiquitin. resembling sumo and other ubl proteins, nedd <dig> is synthesized in an immature form and activated by the cleavage of extra amino acids located beyond gly <dig>  <cit> . gly <dig> is then able to form a bond with target site's lysine residue  <cit> . after maturation, nedd <dig> follows ubl protein conjugation pathway with its own specific enzymes . nedd <dig> proteins then can be removed by nedd <dig> isopeptidases, making neddylation a dynamic and reversible process  <cit> .

neddylation may affect lifespan, function and structure of target protein profoundly by altering the 3d surface, stimulating conformational change, and recruiting nedd8-binding proteins  <cit> . additionally, neddylation may also cause further changes in subcellular localization.

neddylation target proteins are observed to be located predominantly in the nucleus  <cit> . the most characterized targets of neddylation belong to cullin protein family, whose members act as scaffold proteins of multisubunit e <dig> ubiquitin ligases called cullin-ring ligases  <cit> . therefore, neddylation mainly acts as a regulator of ubiquitin-protein ligases  <cit> . secondly, neddylation affects cell-cycle regulation, transcriptional regulation and signal transduction indirectly  <cit> . therefore, aberrations in the neddylation pathway or target sites have been observed in many complex diseases, such as cancer, alzheimer's, and parkinson's  <cit> . besides, severe disruptions in the neddylation pathway are shown to be lethal in many organisms  <cit> .

while neddylation performs significant roles in cellular processes, recognition of target sites and specificity of neddylation is still unclear. identification of neddylation target sites experimentally is an expensive and labour-intensive process. however, there are no previously reported neddylation site motifs or published neddylation site prediction tools available. therefore, there is an obvious need for in silico study of neddylation and prediction of neddylation target sites.

in this work, we have developed a novel method to identify neddylation target sites for the first time using sequence properties, evolutionary conservation, hydrophobicity, disorder and other physicochemical properties of neddylation sites. additionally, we have provided a list of experimentally verified neddylation sites in supplementary information accompanying this article, which can be used as a benchmark set in further neddylation site prediction studies.

RESULTS
initially, we have identified the optimal sequence window length using maximum feature count of  <dig>  fine-tuned svm classification results indicated that the highest average auc was obtained at a window size of  <dig> . therefore, we have continued with the rest of the experiments using this window size. sequence windows  containing neddylation sites were referred in short as positive windows and the rest as negative windows.

properties of neddylation sites
neddylation site properties have not been investigated thoroughly before. in order to fill this gap, we have performed statistical analyses to pinpoint the differences between neddylation sites and other lysine centred sequence windows. initially, we have investigated differences in amino acid preferences at each position of a sequence window. we have performed two separate analyses for this case: two-sample sequence logo analysis and amino acid enrichment analysis using chi-square test of independence. for both of these analyses, all sites from training, validation and test sets were combined to reveal the characteristics of neddylation sites using all available data.

two-sample logo analysis  <cit>  with default parameters showed that immediate vicinity of central lysine was enriched with a methionine residue and glycine residues . a band of positively charged amino acids was enriched in the close positions of central lysine while even further positions were enriched with polar amino acids, glycine residues, and aliphatic amino acids in the upstream.

statistical testing results with bonferroni correction validated the methionine finding of two-sample logo analysis. methionine enrichment at position - <dig> was found to be statistically significant, χ <dig>   =  <dig> , p < 10- <dig>  methionine at position - <dig> was present in 20% of the neddylation sites while only 2% of non-neddylated sites had a methionine residue at this position. similarly, isoleucine presence was also significantly different in position - <dig> of neddylated  and non-neddylated  sites, χ <dig>   =  <dig> , p < 10- <dig>  as it was observed in sequence logo, significantly more valine residues in position - <dig> were present in neddylated sites  than non-neddylated sites , χ <dig>   =  <dig> , p =  <dig> . another noteworthy difference, the frequency of arginine at position - <dig> of positive windows was found to be different than that of negative windows, χ <dig>   =  <dig> , p < 10- <dig>  it was observed that neddylation sites have positively charged amino acids at this position more frequently . all of the listed amino acid preference differences were partly identified before for determining a consensus cullin neddylation motif   <cit> . our findings support this motif for aforementioned positions. however, this motif does not account for other amino acid presence differences that were observed in this dataset, such as over-representation of histidine residues in position + <dig> of neddylation sites , and over-representation of asparagine in position + <dig> in neddylation sites .

position-independent aspartic acid , and glutamic acid  counts in a window were also found to be significantly lower in positive windows than negative windows, p < 10- <dig>  this finding was in parallel with positive amino acid enrichments, suggesting a preference of positive charges instead of negative ones in the vicinity of lysine residues in neddylation sites. besides, ratio of average occurrence of aspartic or glutamic acid residues in a window to average occurrence of these residues in whole protein indicated that these residues are significantly less observed in neddylated sites .

apart from amino acid preferences, we have identified various significant physicochemical differences between positive and negative windows. positive windows were found to be flexible more frequently  than negative windows, χ <dig>   =  <dig> , p < 10- <dig>  parallel to this finding, flexibility confidence ratio-based measure  was also found to be significantly different, χ <dig>   =  <dig> , p =  <dig> . 43% of positive windows had more confidently predicted flexible residues than rigid ones while it was only 17% for the negative windows. functionally similar to window flexibility, window disorder predictions with a cut-off of  <dig>  were also found to be different between positive and negative windows, χ <dig>   =  <dig> , p < 10- <dig>  again, 41% of positive windows were found to be disordered while only 9% of negative windows had this feature. we have also investigated the co-occurrence of window flexibility and window disorder predictions by further looking into sequence windows that have at least one these two properties. we found that majority of positive windows that were predicted to be flexible were also predicted to be disordered . only a single site was predicted to be flexible but not disordered. also, two sites were predicted as disordered but not flexible. this was not the case for negative windows. results indicated that these negative windows were a mixture of flexible but not disordered , disordered but not flexible , and both flexible and disordered .

lastly, positive windows were found more frequently at the n- or c- terminus of the protein than negative windows, χ <dig>   =  <dig> , p < 10- <dig>  57% of the positive sites were found to be at the termini while only 19% of the negative sites were in this region. 10% of the all residues located near n- or c- terminus were considered as at "termini" for this calculation. details can be found in the methods section. statistical significance of this property was also sensible as termini regions are relatively free to interact with partners. complete list of statistically significant features can be found in supplementary information .

model performance and feature selection
incremental feature selection using the mrmr ordered feature list resulted in an optimal feature set containing  <dig> features . this feature set included evolutionary conservation scores of some positions, both grouped and non-grouped amino acid preferences at some positions, average occurrence ratios and occurrence counts of particular amino acids or amino acid groups, binary window disorder prediction, and hydrophobicity of particular positions in the window. an interesting result was that solvent accessibility prediction and window flexibility predictions were not present in the retained feature set. top  <dig> of the selected features can be found in table  <dig> and the complete list was given in supplementary information . additionally, contributions to prediction performance of each related feature set in the selected features were evaluated by removing each set one by one from the training dataset . these results showed that positional amino acid preferences -or sequence motifs- are the most contributing features in prediction.

† cross-validation  results were reported as means of  <dig> repeats. as two standard errors were not exceeding  <dig> , they were not reported.

using all  <dig> selected features, we have further analysed the effect of class weights on classification accuracy. we observed that the average auc increases with the weight assigned to positive instances and becomes almost constant after 1: <dig> . therefore, optimal class weight was selected as 1: <dig> 

after optimization of class weights and features, we have investigated training performance of our model using different evaluation strategies . mostly due to the effect of the high weight assigned to the positive class, our model learned positive instances perfectly, as shown in the self-consistency results. however, this was not an overlearning case, considering consistently high specificity and sensitivity in cross-validation results. we also plotted receiver-operating-characteristic  curves to further investigate the behaviour of our prediction model . steadily high auc values suggest that our model demonstrates a robust performance. besides, independent test set results indicate that the high performance of our model was not limited to the training data, as holdout test data results show an auc of  <dig> .

† cross-validation  results were reported as means of  <dig> repeats. as two standard errors were not exceeding  <dig> , they were not reported.

comparison with known and derived motifs
our model is the first ever neddylation site prediction model in literature. therefore, it is not possible to compare with a state of the art method. in order to overcome this problem, we have used 21mers to discover neddylation motifs using meme  <cit> . meme was used in two different modes: normal and discriminative mode. using normal mode with one occurrence per sequence and minimum motif width of  <dig>  meme identified a single possible motif  with e-value of  <dig> x10- <dig>  using discriminative mode with same parameters, meme gave a similar result. it identified a single motif  with e-value of  <dig> x10- <dig>  these two motifs and one consensus cullin neddylation motif   <cit>  in literature were used for comparison . test set performance of these motifs revealed that they can correctly predict only a single cul3a neddylation site in a. thaliana and misclassify all non-cullin neddylation sites. additionally, another cullin neddylation site was misclassified by all three motifs. performance evaluation of all motifs indicates that there is no generalizable neddylation motif possible with the data available in the literature. therefore, it can be argued that sequence by itself is not sufficient in capturing variability of neddylation sites and additional sequence characteristics are needed for predicting neddylation sites in both cullins and other proteins.

1this motif was derived using meme normal mode. 2this motif was derived using meme discriminative mode. for prediction of both motifs, same training sites with svm training were used.  <dig> this motif was reviewed in  <cit> .

investigation of multiple ubiquitin-like modifications at same target sites
ubiquitylation and neddylation have been previously shown to act together to coordinate target protein activity  <cit> . also, some proteins are shown to be modified with multiple ubiquitin-like modifiers simultaneously  <cit> . this may be due to dynamic control of cellular signaling pathways, similarity of ubl conjugation mechanisms, lack of specificity of e <dig> enzymes, and enzyme sharing under certain circumstances  <cit> . in order to identify possible sites with multiple ubl modifications, we have obtained all known sumoylation and ubiquitylation sites of a. thaliana, r. norvegicus, m. musculus, and s. cerevisiae proteins from dbptm  <cit>  and applied our prediction method. summary of obtained dataset can be found in supplementary information . we have predicted putative neddylation sites in these proteins with two different thresholds: medium  and high . these thresholds were set to decision values outputted by svm, which represent the distance of the samples to the separating hyperplane. higher absolute decision values imply deeper points or more confident decisions. performance metrics under different thresholds can be found in supplementary information .

medium threshold prediction results show high amounts of neddylation sites in proteins obtained from dbptm .  <dig> proteins out of  <dig> were predicted to have at least one neddylation site  under medium threshold. large number of predicted neddylation sites may indicate an over-prediction of model, since it was developed with a small dataset. however, mouse iκbα protein were predicted to be sumoylated, ubiquitylated and neddylated at position  <dig>  this prediction was noteworthy as it may indicate a highly dynamic control of nf-κb pathway.

using more confident neddylation predictions with high threshold, neddylation predictions dropped significantly .  <dig> proteins out of  <dig> were predicted to have at least one predicted neddylation site . additionally, we have failed to observe any site that is modified by all three of the modifications. species-specific results can be found in supplementary information .

in addition to using our predictor with known other ubl modification sites, we have used other ubl prediction methods on known neddylation sites to determine possible unknown shared sites. we have merged training, validation and test sets of our method and predicted their ubl modification status with a ubiquitylation predictor, ubpred  <cit> , and a sumoylation predictor, gps-sumo  <cit> . for sumoylation site predictions, only covalent attachment of sumo proteins were considered, and non-covalent sumo interaction predictions were discarded.

ubpred predicted ~20% , ~12% , and ~2%  of the neddylation sites as ubiquitylation with low, medium and high confidence respectively. ubpred training dataset was not searched for presence of known neddylation sites, as uniprot ids and site locations were not reported in original publication of ubpred. on the other hand, gps-sumo predicted ~6% , ~4% , and ~4%  of neddylation sites as sumoylated with low, medium and high thresholds respectively. none of the predicted sites were present as sumoylation sites in gps-sumo training dataset. none of the sites predicted by ubpred and gps-sumo were the same site.

prediction difference between ubpred and gps-sumo was meaningful, since it has been observed that in environments with elevated nedd <dig> to ubiquitin ratio, neddylation is dependent on ubiquitylation enzymes  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that ubpred would capture targets of shared enzymes under certain circumstances. lastly, difference of predicted sites and low prediction ratio in known neddylation sites indicate that neddylation sites have their unique patterns; therefore, in silico identification of neddylation sites require separate predictors.

in conclusion, our analyses support the findings on multiple ubiquitin-like modifications at the same target site. however, it is not possible to identify intricate activation or repression relationship between different type of ubl modifications using our findings.

discussion
neddylation is one of the vital mechanisms in cellular machinery, and it significantly alters the fate of any target protein. hence, as with other post-translational modifications, it is one of the key components in understanding the function, regulation and lifetime of a protein. besides, aberrations in neddylation or deneddylation of a target protein may result in many anomalies and diseases. therefore, in addition to guiding proteomic studies, in silico identification of neddylation sites may be of help in functionalizing disease-related genomic variants and understanding aetiology and pathogenesis of many diseases, such as alzheimer's and parkinson's. this paper introduces the first method for predicting neddylation sites from protein sequences that may aid in such studies.

conformational flexibility was previously hypothesized to be a general feature of target sites in sumoylation and more generally ubiquitin-like protein modification mechanisms  <cit> . we can extend this hypothesis to include disorder, and more generally, freedom of movement of target sites. in this study, we showed that neddylated and non-neddylated sites are significantly different in conformational flexibility and disorder. also, disorder is one of the most important factors in prediction of neddylation sites. we have demonstrated this for the first time in literature for neddylation site prediction. besides, this finding is noteworthy as freedom of movement provides easy adjustment of partners in e2/e3-target protein interaction pairs. it also implies that structural information may improve neddylation site prediction; however, sequence-based structural information predictors are sufficient for such purposes. another interesting factor related to the movement freedom of the target site is the site's location. we observed that many of the neddylation sites are actually located in the c- or n- terminus. the statistical significance of all features related to freedom of movement  supports our hypothesis, in which ubl target site recognition requires a certain freedom of movement. furthermore, this finding is not limited to only neddylation sites, but can be employed in the development of various other post-translational modification prediction methods, such as ubiquitylation and phosphorylation. previously, we have exploited conformational flexibility and disorder in sumoylation site prediction with a different strategy, in which we were interested in conformational flexibility and disorder of the central lysine only  <cit> . in contrast, we used average window conformational flexibility and disorder in this work. window-wise measures of flexibility and disorder are more informative than measures of the central lysine, as site recognition is more likely to be based on not only the target lysine residue, but also the amino acids in the vicinity of the target residue.

moreover, we have investigated neddylation site properties to assist understanding the regulation of neddylation and the mechanisms of site recognition in a large scale. among other amino acid preferences, methionine enrichment at position - <dig> was interesting since sumoylation consensus site motif  includes a methionine residue at the same position. on the other hand, this shared enrichment does not indicate that sumoylation and neddylation sites have common overall patterns. for instance, while sumoylation sites are enriched with acidic amino acids after the central lysine, neddylation sites tend to have more basic amino acids. therefore, these two post-translational modifications may require separate mechanisms for target recognition. additionally, we also observed that some of the positions are occupied with conserved residues in neddylation sites, as three pssm scores were retained in feature selection. one of pssm scores  was ranked second in the ordered feature list.

the major limitation of this study was the size of the dataset used. the discovery of neddylation is relatively recent and studies on neddylation target proteins have been limited so far. this limitation may influence both the prediction performance and the confidence of statistical analyses. for instance, some of the statistically significant features may be declared significant only due to frequency differences particular to this dataset, not to an underlying biological principle. however, the ever-increasing amount of experimentally validated neddylation target sites as well as further studies on neddylation site recognition may improve prediction performance. another performance limiting factor can be mediated post-translational modifications. it has been argued that in some of the ubl modifications, special proteins, called degrons, mediate substrate site recognition with e <dig> enzymes  <cit> . alternatively, neddylation of a protein may require another post-translational modification to reveal its neddylation site. such cases would be completely missed out by our method and most of the other ubl target site predictors. another issue would be the reliability of the dataset as neddylation also uses ubiquitylation enzymes under elevated free nedd <dig> to ubiquitin ratio conditions  <cit> . therefore, there is still a need for experimental studies on reliable neddylation sites and various aspects of neddylation site recognition mechanisms.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have developed a novel neddylation site prediction method, exploiting the sequence characteristics and sequence-derived features of residues located in the vicinity of lysines. additionally, we have investigated the frequency of these properties to reveal valuable information for further understanding neddylation. major direction for future work lays in the development of a web service for neddylation site prediction to make it accessible to the biological research community.
