BACKGROUND
wheat , an allohexaploid species, is one of the most important and widely cultivated crops in the world. wheat has extensive agronomic adaptability and can be cultivated from 67° n in scandinavia and russia to 45° s in argentina, including the tropics and subtropics  <cit> . the crop is used largely for human food and livestock feed.

the chemical components of wheat seed include protein, carbohydrate, lipid, nucleic acid, pigment, vitamin, enzymes, and inorganic materials. mature wheat seeds consist mainly of starch  and proteins . carbohydrates exist mainly in the form of starch, which accounts for 55–70% of the whole seed weight and is activated to provide energy when the seeds germinate. seed proteins include albumins, globulins, gliadins, and glutenins  <cit> , of which gliadins and glutenins are the main storage proteins that determine the viscoelasticity of dough  <cit> . their mobilization also provides energy and other intermediate products during seed germination. albumins and globulins are important in human nutrition because they are abundant in essential amino acids such as lysine, tryptophan, and methionine  <cit> .

seed germination commences with imbibition, the uptake of water by the quiescent dry seed, and terminates with the elongation of the embryonic axis  <cit> . subsequent reserve mobilizations are associated with seedling growth. the seed undergoes a three-phase process of physiological and morphological changes. the first phase  is a rapid initial uptake, in which seeds begin to expand and the seed coat becomes softer. meanwhile, the physical state of storage materials such as starch, proteins, and lipids change gradually. then the germinated seed enters a plateau phase  and water uptake increases . the third phase occurs as the embryonic axes elongate after germination is complete  <cit> . respiration and energy production play key roles in whole seed germination. in the beginning, the energy for seed germination is mainly provided by anaerobic respiration, then respiratory activity increases as oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide release accelerate during imbibition. oxygen uptake is associated with oxidation phosphorylation through cytochrome oxidase  <cit> .

because seed germination is highly related to seedling survival rate and subsequent vegetative growth, it directly affects wheat yield and quality. initial primary studies on seed germination focused mainly on aspects of seed physiology and biochemistry  <cit>  and allowed us to have a basic understanding of the seed germination process. in recent years, proteome and transcriptome approaches have been used to study the biochemical mechanisms of plant seed germination. considerable proteomics work has been performed on the studies of seed germination in many plants, such as arabidopsis <cit> , cress  <cit> , sugar beet  <cit> , medicago truncatula <cit> , barley  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and rice  <cit> ; however, the number of proteins detected by the proteome approach is limited and therefore does not allow a complete genome-wide comparison. dry mature seeds contain a large number of mrna species. cotton was the first plant found to store rna in a mature dry seed  <cit> ; after the 1990s, stored rna was found to be universal in the mature dry seeds of plant species  <cit> . stored mrna in seeds reflects gene expression patterns during seed germination  <cit> . affymetrix arrays can provide a comprehensive description and real-time changes at the whole-transcriptome level during seed germination and have been used to investigate the biological processes of seed germination in many plants such as arabidopsis  <cit> , barley  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and maize  <cit> . wheat grain development has been studied mostly by transcriptome approaches  <cit> . investigations into wheat seed germination at the transcriptional level have remained limited to a particular germination stage  <cit> ; comprehensive dynamic transcriptome characterization during wheat seed germination has not been done.

modern allohexaploid wheat with a, b, and d genomes have a huge and complex genome . wheat genome sequencing has made recent progress  <cit> . genome projects on au genome in triticum urartu and dt genome in aegilops tauschii, the progenitors of a and b genomes in hexaploid wheat, respectively, have been completed  <cit>  and have facilitated further proteome and transcriptome studies on wheat seed germination. in this study, we used jimai  <dig>  an elite chinese bread wheat cultivar with high yield, wide adaptability, and superior quality  <cit> , to perform the first dynamic transcritpome microarray analysis during five germination stages using the genechip® wheat genome array . our results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of wheat seed germination.

RESULTS
morphology and sem observation during seed germination progress
upon imbibition, wheat seed inflated gradually, but embryo appearance was relatively unchanged in the first  <dig> hours after imbibition , as shown in figure 1a. at  <dig> hai, the structures surrounding the embryo were penetrated by the radical, and both radical and bud emerged at  <dig> hai. the plumule become slightly green and radicals elongated at  <dig> hai.

during the germination process, seed weight increased with imbibition . water uptake is rapid in the early germination stage; consequently, seed weight increased rapidly at  <dig> hai and continued to increase steadily from  <dig> to  <dig> hai. abundant early imbibition establishes a basis for the mobilization of water-soluble metabolites, which provide the continuous energy for the seed germination and subsequent seedling growth.

wheat endosperm contains three kinds of starch granules before imbibition: a-type , b-type  and c-type . these starch granules provide important energy supplies for seed germination. scanning electronic microscope  observation of endosperm demonstrated that the diameter of a-type starch granules increased along with seed imbibition . endosperm space become sparse after water uptake, and almost all starch granules inflated, indicating that storage starch gradually degraded to provide energy for germination.

transcriptome expression profile and functional categories during seed germination
to investigate transcriptome expression profiles during seed germination, we performed a gene chip analysis with genechip® wheat genome arrays, which contain  <dig>  probe sets representing  <dig>  transcripts  <cit> . in our experiment, a total of  <dig>  probe sets  representing  <dig>  transcripts were identified . the  <dig>  probe sets can be classified into  <dig> bins; among  <dig>  probe sets with different functions,  <dig> bins were classified with automatic annotations of metabolic pathways and large enzyme families. another  <dig>  probe sets were classified as unknown or not assigned . the probe sets related to protein, rna, enzyme families, signaling and transporters were a large proportion of those identified with functions, indicating their significant roles during seed germination.

genome-wide transcriptional profiling demonstrated that extensive gene expression occurred during germination. a total of  <dig>  probe sets corresponding to  <dig>  transcripts were declared differentially expressed during five seed germination phases . when successive time points were compared, the number of up- or downregulated genes between two successive time points was obtained . results showed that  <dig>  genes were upregulated, whereas  <dig>  genes were downregulated during the seed germination process.

further analysis of  <dig>  transcripts demonstrated that  <dig> expression profiles were highly significant, and these profiles were classified into four groups. as shown in figure  <dig>  the upregulated genes in group i and downregulated genes in group ii accounted for  <dig> % of the total differentially expressed genes. genes in group iii displayed upregulated expression between  <dig> and  <dig> hai but were downregulated sharply during the late germination progress. the genes in group iv were initially downregulated, then upregulated gradually after  <dig> hai. among  <dig> expression profiles, the two most significant patterns  according to their p-values had the largest number of differentially expressed genes, including  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively .

hierarchical cluster analysis  was used to reveal the coordinate changes in some important gene functional categories that were activated during each phase of seed germination . three distinct phases corresponding to two clear switch points at  <dig> and  <dig> hai could be divided according to cluster. the first phase with rapid initial uptake was 0– <dig> hai, when genes involved in small-molecule sucrose degradation were activated. the second phase was from 12– <dig> hai, when metabolism genes related to three major nutriments  and cell wall metabolism began to be activated. from  <dig> to  <dig> hai, seed germination entered the third phase, a distinct transition stage in which the metabolic genes were continuously and abundantly expressed. at the end of germination , genes related to photosynthesis were activated and the embryonic axis clearly elongated. thus, the seed germination process underwent two main switches, from the degradation of small-molecule sucrose to the metabolism of three major nutriments and then to photosynthesis. consequently, energy reserve decreased throughout the germination process, especially at  <dig> and  <dig> hai.

energy provision from reserve mobilization
mapman has been shown to be an effective tool to map transcriptome data, define functional categories, and perform time course analyses for identifying significantly overrepresented functional groups and has been applied to transcriptome analysis in arabidopsis, barley and rice  <cit> . in this study, important gene functional groups activated in different seed germination stages were analyzed by mapman, and the results are shown in figure  <dig> and additional file 2: table s <dig> 

reserve accumulation in the endosperm is initiated in early seed development then ends until the seed matures. during maturation, wheat seeds accumulate reserve materials, including starch, sucrose, lipids, and storage proteins. metabolic activities within the seed are drastically downregulated during dormancy then reactivated during imbibition, germination, and seedling growth. when seeds began to imbibe water, dormancy is broken and the quiescent embryo is able to germinate. in addition to the mobilization of reserves, an important stage for shoot apical meristem  and root apical meristem  development occurs during seed germination. several development-related genes were found to be significantly upregulated at  <dig> hai, such as ck <dig> and bj <dig> related to the wuschel-clavata pathway and cd <dig> and ck <dig> related to sam and ram . in addition, some meristem-related genes encoding signaling receptor kinases, such as bj <dig> and bj <dig>  also showed upregulated expression patterns during seed germination.

according to gene expression data, mobilization of deposited starch, sucrose, and storage proteins begins early in seed germination . for example, glycolysis was activated at the beginning of imbibition along with the mobilization of accumulated sucrose . in this process, genes encoding related key enzymes such as sucrose synthase , hexokinase, phosphofructokinase , and pyruvate kinase , which promote glycolysis, all displayed upregulated expression . for instance, from  <dig> to  <dig> hai, as the key genes in glycolysis, the gene cd <dig> encoding ppfk had 7-fold upregulation, whereas bj <dig> and ck <dig> encoding pk displayed 14- and 15-fold upregulation, respectively ; however, the gene  encoding udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase , the key enzyme for starch synthesis, was downregulated in glycolysis . correspondingly, due to the continuous synthesis of pyruvate, which then turned into alcohol and entered the fermentation pathway, the genes involved in the fermentation process were upregulated as glycolysis. for example, two important enzymes of catalysis in fermentation, pyruvate decarboxylase  and alcohol dehydrogenase , were significantly upregulated . both glycolysis and fermentation pathway–related genes were downregulated after  <dig> hai, probably due to the end of the mobilization of stored sucrose .

seed germination then entered the stationary phase. starch mobilization occurred after sucrose degradation. when the seed endosperm imbibed a certain amount of water, the starch genes were activated in the endosperm between  <dig> and  <dig> hai and reached a period of great prosperity after  <dig> hai, then related genes were gradually downregulated after  <dig> hai due to the continuous consumption of starch .

amylases are major enzymes for wheat starch cleavage. in our study, most genes related to alpha-amylase, such as ca <dig>  al <dig> and bf <dig>  were initially upregulated starting at  <dig> hai and reached a maximum at  <dig> hai, whereas expressions of beta-amylase were downregulated during the seed germination process . this result indicates that alpha-amylase is a major enzyme that hydrolyzes starch for glucose provision. along with the transcriptional activation of starch-degrading genes, the transcripts of genes encoding fructokinase invertases and hexokinase, sucrose synthesis and glycolysis increased , which might be due to hexose supply and sucrose synthesis from mobilized starch reserves  <cit> .

the storage of organic material from seed endosperm or cotyledon should be broken down into small molecular compounds such as ammonium, phosphate, amino acids, peptides, oligopeptides, sugars, and major intrinsic proteins and transported to the radicle and embryo in the process of use, so the transport genes were activated and upregulated following the reserve mobilization . our results showed that the transcripts encoding metabolite transporters at the mitochondrial membrane accumulated most quickly from  <dig> to  <dig> hai, whereas the transcripts encoding metabolite transporters at the envelope membrane were upregulated most quickly from  <dig> to  <dig> hai .

lipid mobilization begins soon after imbibition, followed by a lag phase. lipase is a key enzyme for lipid hydrolysis. as a result, fatty acid  is synthesized continuously . after  <dig> hai, the transcripts of fa synthesis were highly upregulated, and their expression was gradually downregulated at the end of lipid mobilization . genes involved in the β-oxidation pathway as a major pathway of fa degradation and phospholipases also were significantly upregulated from  <dig> to  <dig> hai . β-oxidation is involved in lipid degradation, which eventually results in energy release by peroxisomes and provides a carbon supply for the production of sucrose  <cit> .

storage proteins are located mainly in the endosperm and aleurone. according to our gene expression data, mobilization of deposited storage proteins begins during late seed germination , and their metabolic products, amino acids, serve as important nutritional resources for early seedling growth after germination. during this and the following period , the transcripts for storage protein degradation, such as cysteine protease, aspartate protease and serine protease, increased significantly . genes for amino acid metabolism, such as asp, met, ser, cys, phe and trp, were simultaneously activated . from  <dig> to  <dig> hai, the gene expression related to protein modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation increased . this result suggests that synthesis of some clastic enzymes is necessary to mobilize storage protein at this germination stage.

according to our experiments, photosynthesis genes were mobilized slightly after initiation of reserve mobilization during seed germination. as shown in figure 1a, the cotyledons gradually became green at  <dig> hai, indicating that preparations for photosynthesis were almost finished. the genes for photosynthesis, including those related to light reaction, photorespiration, and the calvin cycle, were activated, and their expression was highly upregulated at the end of  <dig> hai .

the seeds became tumescent quickly due to water absorption at the beginning of germination. genes related to the major constituents of the cell wall  were activated at  <dig> to  <dig> hai . due to the stasis following imbibition, the related genes of cell wall synthase and degradation were almost downregulated. the seed does not take up water again until the radicle breaks through the seed coat, then these genes are gradually upregulated . the cell wall is largely degraded after  <dig> hai , which activates some important enzymes related to degradation, such as cellulases and pectate lyases . meanwhile, the genes for cell wall synthesis and modification were largely upregulated . this indicates that lots of fractured cell wall was degraded into small molecules to provide raw materials for cell wall synthesis during seed germination.

signal pathway network analysis
a signal pathway network was established according to the functions of signal genes by java in the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database . in the network, three genes are at the center of a signal pathway network: os01g <dig> , os01g <dig> , and os09g <dig>  . phosphofructokinase is a rate-limiting enzyme in the glycolytic pathway that provides a phosphoryl group from atp to facilitate a wide variety of biological processes. the expression pattern of ppfk family protein belonged to profile no.  <dig>  which was upregulated at first then sharply downregulated after  <dig> hai. fructose- <dig>  6-bisphosphatase is an enzyme that converts fructose- <dig>  6-bisphosphate to fructose-6-phosphate in gluconeogenesis. its transcriptional level placed it in profile no.  <dig>  which trended opposite the ppfk family protein. activation of fructose- <dig>  6-bisphosphatase in gluconeogenesis seems to play an important role in amino acid metabolism. utp-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, also known as utp-glucose pyrophosphorylase , is associated with glycogenesis, which synthesizes udp-glucose from glucose-1-phosphate and utp and was upregulated throughout germination, reaching its peak at  <dig> hai.

metabolic pathway network analysis
metabolic pathway network was established as shown in figure  <dig>  according to the degree value , glycolysis and gluconeogenesis metabolisms were located at the center of pathway net, suggesting that the genes involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis such as those encoding the ppfk family protein, pk and fructose- <dig>  and 6-bisphosphatase, play key roles in providing energy for seed germination. the citrate cycle  had the second-highest degree value in the pathway net and mainly provided energy for the late germination of seeds. as the key enzymes of the tca cycle,  <dig> enzyme-coding genes  were upregulated gradually during germination. these genes related to energy metabolism were initiated early in the process, indicating the activation of respiratory activities in mitochondria and atp release. in accordance, at least  <dig> genes related to vacuolar atpase and mitochondrial atp synthase complexes and mitochondrial carrier proteins were preferentially upregulated during seed germination . the alcohol dehydrogenase  gene in the fermentation pathway was also upregulated sharply to provide energy for seed germination. pyruvate is an important intermediate product that plays a mediated role, and pyruvate metabolism is another important pathway. pyruvate metabolism converts pyruvate into acetyl-coa, which is used in lipid biosynthesis and the tca cycle, in two ways  <cit> . one way is catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase , which catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-coa. the other way is catalyzed by pyruvate decarboxylase  and aldehyde dehydrogenase , which catalyzes the irreversible conversion of pyruvate to acetaldehyde and co <dig>  so acetaldehyde can be converted into acetate to produce additional acetyl-coa.

from the metabolic pathway network, many amino acids, including lysine, tyrosine, arginine and praline, were triggered to provide a major nitrogen source for nitrogen metabolism and intermediates for the tca cycle. three kinds of enzymes are involved in lysine degradation: the aldehyde dehydrogenase  family protein, a set domain containing protein and the dihydrolipoyllysine-residue succinyltransferase component of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. fumarylacetoacetase, aspartate aminotransferase and alcohol dehydrogenase  <dig> are involved in tyrosine metabolism. in arginine and proline metabolism, the expression of four enzyme genes  was upregulated compared with the dry seed, whereas two enzyme genes  were gradually downregulated during germination .

gene co-expression network with k-core algorithm
to determine the functional genes that play pivotal roles in the germination of wheat seed, genes involved in some important pathways were further analyzed by gene co-expression network with a k-core algorithm . the most central gene has the highest degree value within the network. according to k-core values,  <dig> genes with higher k-core levels in our results were considered to have a core status . most of the genes are attributed to transport, signaling pathway, development, lipid metabolism, stress and defense response, nitrogen metabolism and the transcription progress. three of the most important core genes, cd <dig> encoding embryonic abundant protein  <dig>  cd <dig> encoding cax <dig> , and ck <dig> encoding cyp78a <dig>  were located at the center of the network with the highest k-core levels. they directly regulated  <dig> neighboring genes according to their degrees . these genes decreased drastically during germination, especially cd <dig> . in the network, ck <dig>  is one of the upregulated genes  and is located at the center of network with k-cores of  <dig> and  <dig> degrees, indicating its involvement in a variety of functions including defense response, signal transduction, lipid metabolic process, the carbohydrate metabolic process and the ethylene biosynthetic process.

in the network, three genes, bj <dig>  bj <dig> and cd <dig>  were involved in protein metabolism. bj <dig> , with k-cores of  <dig> and  <dig> degrees, and bj <dig> , with k-cores of  <dig> and  <dig> degrees, are mainly involved in regulating the degradation of proteins . because the products of protein degradation need be transported from endosperm to embryo, co-adjustment between the related genes of protein degradation and the correlative genes of transport  are consistent and show that these genes are positively regulated in the network, suggesting that the down/upregulation of protein degradation genes would lead to the down/upregulation of transport genes. the function of cd <dig>  is to regulate protein folding, then catalyze the modification of protein by regulating the other gene that participates in the posttranslational modification, ca <dig> . because the function of both cd <dig> and ca <dig> is the process opposite protein degradation, we can infer that the co-adjustment between cd <dig> and cd <dig> is negative regulation, which is consistent with the results shown in figure  <dig> 

verification of gene expression patterns by qrt-pcr
real-time quantitative reverse transcriptional pcr  was used to confirm the expression of  <dig> representative genes, including  <dig> upregulated genes and  <dig> downregulated genes with specific primers . optimal experiments showed higher amplification efficiency and specificity of  <dig> genes . as shown in figure  <dig>  the expression patterns of these  <dig> genes were generally consistent with their transcriptional expression models.

discussion
energy requirements of seed germination
plants require a large amount of energy for physiological activities during seed germination. due to the lack of a mineral-uptake system and photosynthetic apparatus, germinating seeds rely on reserve mobilization, mainly starch, proteins and lipids, to provide essential energy for growth until the seedling becomes photoautotrophic  <cit> . wheat is a monocot crop, and its energy reserves are mainly stored in the endosperm, which is degraded for embryo growth during germination. due to limited oxygen content, energy is supplemented by glycolysis and alcohol fermentation during early seed imbibition. rate-limiting enzymes ppfk and pk were involved in glycolysis, whereas pdc and adh were involved in ethanol fermentation. the energy demands of germinating cereal seeds seem to be met mainly by glycolysis  <cit> . the energy provided by anaerobic respiration cannot satisfy the needs of germinated seeds; at this point, the tca cycle provides a large amount of energy in oxygen-rich conditions. one of the rate-limiting enzymes in tca cycle, idh, accumulates during seed germination and post-germination. the ultimate purpose of starch mobilization, lipid mobilization and protein mobilization is to provide energy. the degradation products of energy reserves always go into glycolysis, then through the tca cycle and mitochondrial electron transport for atp synthesis. so, along with the degradation of starch, lipid and protein, the genes related to energy metabolism  were initiated from  <dig> to  <dig> hai, indicating the activation of respiratory activities in mitochondrial and atp release . the above three respiratory pathways are essential for energy provision of a wide range of cellular functions  <cit>  as described in this work.

starch and sucrose metabolism
the majority of stored endosperm reserves are starch, and their degradation is catalyzed by alpha-amylase. some genes that are vital to the degradation of starch were found in this study, such as bf <dig> and al <dig>  which encode alpha-amylase . the degradation of starch products can go into glycolysis in two ways. first, amylases can convert the starch into maltose, which then breaks down into glucose and participates in glycolysis; second, starch phosphorylase can convert starch into glucose-1-phosphate, which then enters glycolysis. in this study, most of the genes related to alpha-amylase and starch phosphorylase were upregulated after  <dig> hai . this result indicates that large-scale starch mobilization occurs at about  <dig> hai before radicle protrusion, similar to the results found in barley  <cit> . pritchard et al. suggested that the majority of sucrose results from storage lipid degradation and not from other soluble sugars within the arabidopsis seeds  <cit> ; however, our results revealed that initial sucrose is derived from soluble sugars, whereas the majority of sucrose comes from the mobilization of storage starch — lipids as well as some amino acids  — which is similar to germinating barley seeds  <cit> . sucrose may be resolved into glucose and fructose by susy , then enter glycolysis. we found one gene  highly similar to at3g <dig>  which encodes sus <dig> . sus <dig> is one enzyme of susy, which is a highly regulated enzyme that reversibly converts sucrose and nucleoside diphosphate into the corresponding nucleoside diphosphate glucose and fructose; this process may occur in most plants, including cereal crops  <cit> .

protein mobilization
besides starch, the other most important energy reserves are proteins in the seeds. in early germination, many genes related to protein synthesis, modification and degradation were significantly upregulated . we assume that these proteins are hydrolytic enzymes and proteins relating to hormone signaling, which prepares present and subsequent metabolism. according to the previous analysis, we can also speculate that many genes encode some preceding metabolic enzymes in dry seeds. when the seeds imbibed water, the enzymes activated directly and catalyzed important metabolism processes, such as glycolysis. the protein degradation for the authentic energy requirements occurred in late germination ; however, the expression of genes encoding some important enzymes in this process, such as cysteine protease, aspartate protease and serine protease, were activated a little early . germination is known to be partly under the control of gibberellins , which act to stimulate germination  <cit> , because phytohormone ga plays an important role in triggering the above major proteinases during germination  <cit> .

activation of developmental genes
shoot and root meristem, as the primary plant meristems, are initiated at opposite poles of the plant embryo. sam contains a self-renewing population of undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells, which supply cells for the development of all aboveground structures  <cit> , whereas ram produces the primary and lateral root systems  <cit> . in this study, sam-related gene cd <dig>  which belongs to the rna functional class, is involved in the regulation of transcription and was activated along with seed imbibition. the gene displayed upregulated expression during seed germination and reached its highest expression level at  <dig> hai. ram-related gene ck <dig> was rapidly activated after seed imbibition and exhibited an upregulated expression pattern during the seed germination process, which belongs to the redox functional class and is involved in stress response . previous reports have speculated that angiosperm ram evolved from the sam, probably due to plants’ adaptation to changing environmental requirements  <cit> .

in arabidopsis thaliana, stem cell homeostasis in the sam is controlled by the negative feedback loop of wuschel-vlavata   <cit> . this negative feedback was also found in the present study. both bj <dig>  and ck <dig>  had similar expression profiles during seed germination; i.e., they were upregulated from  <dig> to  <dig> hai, downregulated from  <dig> to  <dig> hai, \ then upregulated again at  <dig> hai . this result suggests a similar developmental pathway during seed germination in wheat as in arabidopsis thaliana.

activation of photosynthesis genes
our results showed that the photosynthetic apparatus was gradually integrated into the seed at about  <dig> hai, indicating that subsequent  growth depends not only on mobilization of energy reserves, but also on photosynthesis. genes related to photosynthesis, including light reaction, photorespiration and the calvin cycle, begin to be largely activated at  <dig> hai. tetrapyrroles have been shown to be important to photosynthesis  <cit> . as reported in barley  <cit> , during  <dig> to  <dig> hai, the tetrapyrrole synthesis genes as well as photosynthesis genes were activated . in this period, two genes encoding protochlorophyllide reductase and uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase related to tetrapyrrole synthesis displayed significantly upregulated expression . photosynthesis uses chlorophylls to convert light to chemical energy, and the protochlorophyllide reductase and uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase are key enzymes that synthesize the chlorophylls; consequently, we can deduce that tetrapyrrole is the intermediate product of chlorophyll synthesis, and the tetrapyrrole could regulate photosynthesis by regulating the chlorophylls.

activation of defense genes
seed development and maturation are accompanied by increased desiccation tolerance  <cit> . when placed in water, due to the change in external environment, wheat seeds are able to activate a series of mechanisms to respond to many biotic and abiotic stresses during germination . cells recognize external stresses and induce many signal proteins, including signaling receptor kinases, light-related proteins, calcium-dependent protein kinases, g-proteins and 14-3- <dig> proteins . studies have found that the tolerance of water, salt, hypoxic, cold stress, and wound or pathogen responses require changes in gene expression  <cit> . our results showed that the transcripts of these signal proteins accumulated during germination and that the expression of most genes was upregulated in early germination, thus demonstrating that stress response is mainly regulated by genes. the resumption of respiratory activity, which can be detected within minutes, is one of the first changes upon imbibition  <cit> . genes for glutathione peroxidase, redox metabolism and super oxide dismutase, which are involved in scavenging reactive oxygen species , were reported to be activated during seed germination at  <dig> hai in barley  <cit> . ros play a pivotal role as triggers of gene expression during biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . in our results, the transcriptional activation of genes for the redox state, peroxidase and glutathione-s-transferase was induced by the respiratory burst. their expression was largely emerging at about  <dig> hai, a little earlier than in barley.

plant hormones regulate plant growth and mediate responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . in the hormone signal pathways, besides the participation of two major players  in controlling germination events, other hormones are involved in an intricate interaction web regulating wheat seed germination  <cit> . studies revealed that abscisic acid  is a positive regulator of dormancy and a negative regulator of germination, whereas gibberelin , ethylene and brassinosteroids  promote seed germination and counteract aba effects in eudicot seeds  <cit> . our results showed that most aba biosynthetic genes were upregulated slightly from  <dig> to  <dig> hai due to the breaking of dormancy, then downregulated sharply during later germination stages . however, ga, ba and ethylene biosynthetic genes were largely upregulated from the beginning to the end of wheat seed germination. these results indicate that the regulation of plant hormones appears to be similar in both eudicot and monocotyledon seeds. in addition, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has been shown to play a surprisingly important role in hormone signaling  <cit> . our results indicated that the ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation started at the very beginning of germination, closely following imbibition . the degradation of these proteins is obviously earlier than that of the storage proteins and starch, which might be a precondition for seed germination, as discovered in rice  <cit> .

mitogen-activated protein kinases  are serine/threonine-specific protein kinases that are activated by a variety of stress stimuli, including osmolarity, drought, temperature, salinity, pathogen infection, wounding and ros, and modulate cellular activities such as proliferation, gene expression, differentiation, mitosis, cell survival and cell death  <cit> . studies have reported that most of the substrates for stress-activated mapks were transcription factors in animal and yeast cells and plants  <cit> . during wheat seed germination, the expression of many transcription factors  related to biotic and abiotic stresses changed significantly, such as the ethylene-responsive element binding protein family , the bzip transcription factor family , the wrky domain transcription factor family  and the myb transcription factor family . as found in barley  <cit> , these tfs were all upregulated in early seed germination, indicating their essential roles. related studies showed that the activation of a mapk can lead to the phosphorylation of transcription factors, which in turn activate gene expression  <cit> . in tobacco, mapks can induce expression of defense genes  <cit> . mapks receive hormonal and other signals and mediate the transcription factors through the mapk cascade reaction, and then these transcription factors regulate defensive genes encoding stress-related proteins’ responses to external biotic and abiotic stresses. in the current study, the expression of many proteins and pathways related to defense genes, such as cell wall synthesis, beta glucanase pr-proteins, proteolysis and secondary metabolites, were gradually upregulated in early germination, which could protect germinating seeds from the damages of biotic and abiotic stresses .

CONCLUSIONS
we used transcriptome approaches to characterize gene expression changes through the five stages of seed germination in elite chinese bread wheat cultivar jimai  <dig>  microarray analysis allowed us to detect a large number of genes related to seed germination. the wheat seed germination process included three distinct phases, and a large number of genes involved in seed germination were classified into different functional groups. mapman and hierarchical cluster analyses yielded a global glance at the changes in gene expression profiles during seed germination. these analyses revealed many important metabolisms  and functional groups  involved in seed germination. the co-regulations of the related genes guaranteed regular seed germination. in addition to obvious global changes during seed germination, kegg and co-expression net analysis revealed the interrelations of many significant filtered differential expression genes, which led to discovery of some pivotal genes and their roles in the seed germination. qrt-pcr analysis further validated the expression patterns of some significant genes. our transcriptome-level results provide new insights into the thoroughly metabolic changes of seed germination as well as the relationships between some significant genes.
