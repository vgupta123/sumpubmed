BACKGROUND
dermatophytes are parasitic fungi that infect skin, hair and nails of both humans and animals. they are the primary causative agents of dermatophytosis, a major public health concern in some geographic regions <cit> . while not fatal, dermatophyte infections cause significant morbidity and are of significant cost to society because of their chronic nature and resistance to therapy. dermatophytes encompass  <dig> genera, trichophyton, epidermophyton, and microsporum. t. rubrum, t. mentagrophytes and m. canis are the most common species in hospital isolates  <cit> . morbidity is less commonly associated with m. nanum while t. ajelloi is a geophilic fungus that only rarely infects human.

mitochondria are generally accepted as descendants of endosymbiotic alpha-proteobacteria <cit>  and are considered to be of monophyletic origin <cit> . as vital physiological processes and basic adaptive strategies do not always correlate with trees derived from ribosomal sequences <cit> , mitochondrial dna  sequences have become a popular tool for phylogenetic studies. individual gene sequences often contain a limited number of informative sites and can lead to incongruent phylogenetic trees. in contrast, entire mitochondrial genomes tend to produce reliable phylogenetic trees <cit> . despite the emergence of new technologies for rapid dna sequence determination, sequencing of complete mtdnas is still more feasible and economical than whole-genome sequencing. furthermore, complete mtdna sequences reveal gene content, order and position, and provide further information regarding introns and intergenic regions  <cit> .

the number of mitochondrial genomes sequenced has increased greatly over the past decade, notably through the interdisciplinary collaboration of the organelle genome megasequencing program . some thousands of complete mtdna sequences are already available from taxonomically diverse organisms including fungi, plants and animals. this resource provides an unprecedented insights into the origin and evolution of the mitochondrial genome  <cit> . in comparison to the genomes of free-living alpha-proteobacteria, the number of genes contained within the modern mitochondrial genome has been greatly reduced. it is inferred that many previously functional genes have been transferred to the nucleus; others appear to have been replaced by pre-existing nuclear genes of similar function  <cit> . moreover, recent studies have suggested that positive selection plays a role in mitochondrial evolution  <cit>  while mtdna polymorphisms are thought to be maintained within populations via selection on the joint mitochondrial-nuclear genotype  <cit> .

the fungal mitochondrial genome typically contains  <dig> conserved protein-coding genes, 22â€“ <dig> trna genes, and  <dig> rrna genes <cit> . mtdna divergence between different fungal species is predominantly associated with variation in intergenic regions, intronic sequences, and gene order <cit> . the fungal mitochondrial genome project was launched over a decade ago  <cit>  and more than  <dig> complete mitochondrial genomes of fungi have been determined to date . nevertheless, only one sequence is derived from a dermatophyte, i.e. e. floccosum  <cit> . indeed, the dearth of publicly available genomic data is a major barrier to biomedical research on dermatophytes  <cit> .

we report here complete mtdna sequences for  <dig> dermatophytes including  <dig> species of trichophyton  and  <dig> species of microsporum . these sequences, with the previously reported e. floccosum mtdna sequence  <cit> , have permitted systematic comparative analysis of dermatophytes. the mitochondrial genomes of dermatophytes are highly conserved, indicating that these superficial fungi are closely related. furthermore, phylogenetic analysis based on complete mitochondrial genomes has revealed that dermatophytes arose very late among the ascomycota fungi. this is the first comparative genomic study on dermatophytes and will provide valuable insights into the genomics and phylogeny of this important group of fungal pathogens.

RESULTS
general features
the mitochondrial sequences of t. rubrum, t. mentagrophytes, t. ajelloi, m. canis and m. nanum are circular dnas of  <dig>  bp,  <dig>  bp,  <dig>  bp,  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively . the mitochondrial genome of m. canis is the smallest of known dermatophytes, while the previously determined e. floccosum is the largest and exceeds  <dig> kb  <cit> . the size differences between mitochondrial genome sizes are primarily due to interspecific variation in intergenic regions and introns .

with the exception of t. rubrum and e. floccosum that carry several additional hypothetical genes, each genome encodes  <dig> conserved protein-coding genes,  <dig> rrna genes , and  <dig> trna genes . the dermatophyte mitochondrial genomes are highly compact: structural genes account for >70% of each genome . all genes are encoded on the same dna strand. moreover, all the mitochondrial genomes retain colinearity at the nucleotide level without detectable dna rearrangement . the high conservation of genome structure indicates that these dermatophytes are closely related.

*data from genbank record ay <dig> 

the overall g+c content of the  <dig> genomes is ~24%  consistent with the characteristic at-rich nature of fungal mitochondrial genomes. the g+c content of genomic regions encoding rna genes is usually higher than the genome average  while the majority of protein-coding genes, with exception of cox <dig>  have a lower g+c content . the unusual g+c content of cox <dig> may reflect its unusual location sandwiched between  <dig> trna gene clusters.

protein-coding genes and rrnas
the five mitochondrial genomes share  <dig> protein-coding genes. these include atp-synthase subunits  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> , cytochrome oxidase subunits i, ii, and iii , apocytochrome b , a ribosomal protein , and nadh dehydrogenase subunits . t. rubrum carries  <dig> additional hypothetical genes  located between trna-val and trna-met . both genes have homologs of >90% nucleotide similarity in the previously determined e. floccosum mitochondrial genome . the function of these putative genes is not yet known; further studies will be required to determine whether they play a role in mitochondrial function.

synonymous base substitutions  are considered to be selectively neutral while substitutions causing amino acid substitution, or non-synonymous substitutions , are almost always adaptive mutations. the dn/ds ratio therefore affords an index of selective pressures operating on protein-coding genes. because selection for adaptive amino acid substitutions increases dn, a dn/ds ratio of > <dig> is found in genes subject to selection for change . in contrast, a dn/ds ratio of < <dig> indicates conservation of essential amino acid sequences . we calculated the dn/ds ratio for each of the  <dig> dermatophyte protein-coding gene. this revealed that all genes are subject to strong negative selection; no statistically significant sites of positive selection were found .

the genomic organization of the  <dig> conserved protein-coding genes in mtdna is surprisingly identical across all the known dermatophytes . furthermore, the same gene order is also largely conserved in other pathogenic filamentous fungi such as penicillium marneffei and aspergillus niger that cause invasive infections  <cit> . however, the order of these conserved genes is markedly rearranged in the mtdna of the opportunistic pathogen candida albicans  <cit>  . the similarity of mtdna gene order between different fungal species was found to correlate with their evolutionary relationships inferred from phylogenetic analysis .

the large  and small  ribosomal rna genes are present in all dermatophyte mitochondrial genomes at the same relative locations. the rps <dig> gene encodes a ribosomal protein that may play a role in maintaining the integrity of the mitochondrial genome  <cit> ; this gene is present within the intron of rnl as expected. the intronic location of this ribosomal protein is therefore maintained in all known dermatophyte mitochondrial genomes.

the previously described nad4l-nad <dig> consecutive gene unit was observed in all  <dig> mitochondrial genomes. this gene pair is believed to be present in all ascomycota as well as the basidiomycota and zygomycota, but is interrupted by one or more genes in chytridiomycota. this may reflect early phylogenetic divergence of these fungi from the ascomycota  <cit> . interestingly, the additional continuous gene unit, nad4l-nad5-nad <dig>  characterized by one base overlap and no interruption in gene junctions, is shared by all dermatophyte mitochondrial genomes with the exception of the  <dig> earlier divergent species, m. canis and t. ajelloi . the arrangement of such uninterrupted blocks may reflect strong conservation during evolution from a common ancestor  <cit> ; more dermatophytes may be expected to carry the consecutive nad4l-nad5-nad <dig> gene unit.

trnas and codon usage
all  <dig> mitochondrial genomes encode the same set of  <dig> trna species with the potential to deliver all  <dig> amino acids. multiple trna isoacceptors exist for only leucine, serine, arginine and methionine. interestingly, the organization of the  <dig> trna genes is conserved between all the mitochondrial genomes. the majority of trnas  are grouped into  <dig> clusters flanked by the atp8-rnl-cox1-atp <dig> gene cluster and containing  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> trnas, respectively . the exceptions are t. rubrum and e. floccosum where the largest trna cluster between rnl and cox <dig> is interrupted and subdivided into two sub-clusters by a ~ <dig>  kb dna fragment containing additional hypothetical genes .

trna genes have been proposed to play a role in gene shuffling as they are located between protein-coding genes and can act as mobile elements  <cit> . homology between isolated trna genes may permit genetic recombination, and therefore genetic rearrangement, while gene shuffling is less likely to take place via recombination between conserved clusters of trna genes <cit> . the low number of isolated trna genes  may therefore contribute to the high conservation of dermatophyte mtdna.

all mitochondrial protein-coding genes commence with a classical methionine codon  and terminate with taa, the preferred fungal mitochondrial termination codon  <cit> . the only exception is atp <dig> where tga is the translation stop codon. table  <dig> summarizes codon usages for all protein-coding genes in the  <dig> mitochondrial genomes. the most frequently used codons are tta , ata , and ttt , accounting for about one third of all codons, and indicating a clear preference for amino acids with nonpolar side chains. this is likely to reflect the fact that the majority of the encoded polypeptides are integral membrane proteins. as expected from the at-rich nature of dermatophyte mtdna, the third position of the most frequently used codons is strongly biased towards a or t . furthermore, the most rarely-used codons, appearing no more than  <dig> times in all genomes , or absent , all contain  <dig> or more g/c nucleotides in each codon.

intergenic regions and introns
the dermatophyte genomes are highly compact with short intergenic regions. in m. canis there is no intergenic region > <dig> kb, while only one intergenic region exceeds  <dig> kb in the other genomes. because protein-coding genes and rnas are highly conserved between species, the differences in mitochondrial genome sizes between the different dermatophytes are largely explained by length variation in intergenic regions. the longest intergenic region in m. canis is only  <dig> nt while all other intergenic regions in this species are under  <dig> nt. in contrast, t. ajelloi mtdna contains  <dig> long intergenic regions  and the longest  spans > <dig>  kb . this divergence in intergenic regions explains the > <dig> kb difference in the genome sizes of t. ajelloi and m. canis.

mtdna intergenic regions diverge not only in size but also in sequence. indeed, multiple pairwise alignment of the different genomes indicates that colinearities are interrupted almost exclusively in intergenic regions . however, many intergenic regions were found to be conserved between t. rubrum and t. mentagrophytes, consistent with the close evolutionary relationship of these  <dig> species as revealed by phylogenetic analysis . remarkably, the longest intergenic region in all genomes is located between cob and nad <dig> , but pairwise alignment revealed little similarity between the cob-nad <dig> intergenic sequences of the different species as indicated by the blank space in the linear comparison view . such divergent intergenic regions may serve as potential genetic markers for species/strain identification of dermatophytes.

many fungal mitochondrial genomes are intron-rich  <cit> . in contrast, all the dermatophyte mtdna gene sequences harbor a single intron , with the exception of t. ajelloi that carries an additional group i intron  within nad <dig> . however, previous mtdna sequence studies revealed that another strain of t. rubrum  harbors  <dig> additional introns within nad <dig> and atp <dig>  respectively  <cit> . moreover, the e. floccosum mitochondrial genome carries  <dig> additional introns located within in cox <dig>  nad <dig>  and cob  <cit> . the number of introns is therefore strain-specific and also contributes to variation in mitochondrial genome size.

phylogenetic analysis
broad phylogenetic trees of fungi were previously constructed based on rdna  <cit>  or nuclear protein-coding genes  <cit>  but these studies did not permit the elucidation of higher-order relationships. a combination of  <dig> gene regions was recently employed to construct a fungal phylogenetic tree comprising ~ <dig> species  <cit> . unfortunately, no dermatophytes were included in this study. we therefore performed phylogenetic analysis based on the complete mitochondrial genomes of  <dig> species of ascomycota, including  <dig> dermatophytes,  <dig> other filamentous fungi, and  <dig> yeasts . the high bootstrap values of most nodes indicate the robustness of the tree computed. fungal species of ascomycota are clustered into  <dig> distinct groups corresponding to subphyla pezizomycotina , saccharomycotina  and taphrinomycotina  respectively . this confirmed the reliability of mtdna sequences in fungal phylogenetic analysis.

interestingly, the tree reported here divides the clade of filamentous fungi into  <dig> subgroups . with only a few exceptions, the dermatophytes cluster together with invasive pathogenic fungi of humans and animals, while the other filamentous fungi, mostly pathogens of plants or insects, form a parallel branch . this suggests that host adaptation has driven the evolution of filamentous fungi. indeed, previous phylogenetic studies revealed separation between anthropophilic and geophilic species of trichophyton  <cit>  suggesting that ecology is a particularly strong driver of dermatophyte evolution  <cit> .

in the tree established here all the dermatophytes species clustered into a single branch, confirming the monophyletic origin of the dermatophyte lineage. aspergillus  <cit>  and p. marneffei  <cit>  comprise a separate branch that shares an immediate ancestor with the dermatophyte group . however, the  <dig> sister branches of human pathogenic fungi  are represented by distinct patterns in the phylogenetic tree. the dermatophytes as a group show far less divergence but longer ancestral branch than the aspergillus-penicillium clade . this indicates the divergence from the latest common ancestor of dermatophytes was later than the aspergillus-penicillium group.

fossil evidence has allowed dating of the emergence of the ascomycota  <cit> . based on this calibration, the dermatophyte lineage may be estimated to have diverged from other fungi at about  <dig> million years ago . this result is consistent with a previous rough estimate  based on nucleotide substitution rates in the small ribosomal subunit rna  <cit> . however, the timing of the radiation of the dermatophytes is much later than the divergence of candida and saccharomyces at  <dig> ma as previously estimated using 20â€“ <dig> protein sequences  <cit> . the high conservation of the dermatophyte mitochondrial genome also suggests that the different dermatophytes diverged only recently.

conventional phenotypic taxonomy has divided the dermatophytes into  <dig> genera: trichophyton, microsporum and epidermophyton  <cit> . though only a limited number of dermatophyte species were included in the present study, the phylogenetic tree established here does not follow this genus demarcation . indeed, recent molecular phylogenetic studies have revealed that both trichophyton and microsporum are paraphyletic  <cit> , prompting reevaluation of the phylogenetic relationships between different dermatophytes  <cit> . remarkably, the divergence of t. ajelloi from the inferred common ancestor was much earlier than of the other dermatophyte species . this is consistent with the geophilic features of t. ajelloi: the soil environment may have afforded an early ecological niche for all dermatophyte species prior to more recent adaptation to specialized hosts including animals and humans. an earlier study based on 25s rrna sequences reported that t. ajelloi and t. terrestre  are separated from the 'true dermatophyte'  <cit>  and further support the suggestion that microsporum, as well as the zoophilic and anthropophilic trichophyton species, evolved from a geophilic member of trichophyton  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
previous studies into the evolutionary relationships between dermatophyte species have been based on nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers  <cit> , large ribosomal rna subunits   <cit> , chitin synthase   <cit> and dna topoisomerase ii genes  <cit> , as well as on pcr fingerprinting  <cit>  and restriction fragment length polymorphism   <cit>  analysis of mitochondrial dna. the dermatophytes were found to constitute a homogeneous group of species with low genetic diversity contrasting with high phenotypic heterogeneity <cit> . we now report comparative analysis of  <dig> complete mitochondrial genomes from all  <dig> dermatophyte genera . the composition and organization of genes within the mtdnas of all dermatophytes analyzed was found to be substantially identical, reinforcing the view that dermatophytes are closely related and constitute a highly conserved lineage of filamentous fungi.

comparative genomics provides a powerful tool for uncovering similarities and differences between species. the present study represents the first application of systematic comparative genomics to dermatophyte phylogeny. the common features shared by all  of dermatophyte mitochondrial genomes are as follows.  <dig>  retention of genome colinearity with high nucleotide sequence similarity  in coding regions; differences between species are largely restricted to introns and intergenic regions.  <dig>  strict conservation of the nad4l-nad <dig> gene unit; the consecutive nad4l-nad5-nad <dig> gene unit is also probably present in most dermatophytes.  <dig>  the presence of  <dig> trna gene clusters of identical composition with  <dig> isolated trna genes at identical locations in all dermatophyte mtdnas.  <dig>  a characteristic rarity of intronic sequences compared to other fungal species.

phylogenetic analysis has confirmed the monophyletic origin of dermatophytic fungi; these form a distinct clade among filamentous fungi. compared with other pathogenic fungi such as those causing invasive infections, dermatophytes comprise a closely-related and recently-diverged lineage of ascomycota fungi. the genomic data presented here will allow further exploration of the relationships between different dermatophyte species and will be of general utility in the study of mitochondrial evolution in higher fungi.
