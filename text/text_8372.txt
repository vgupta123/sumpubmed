BACKGROUND
tuberculosis  is the most significant bacterial infection of humans worldwide involving an estimated  <dig> billion people, that is one third of the world's population  <cit> . the host's immune system plays a central role in the progression of tb infection; it is in fact estimated that about 5-10% of individuals that become infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis develop active pulmonary tb and become infectious, while the large majority develop latent infection due to the immunological containment of infection in specific granulomas where tubercle bacilli do not multiply, but persist in a dormant state without provoking any clinical symptoms  <cit> . latent tb may undergo reactivation when the immune system is less efficient, for example due to hiv infection, malnutrition, aging or other causes. as it is estimated that  <dig> in  <dig> individuals infected with m. tuberculosis will develop active tb in their lifetime  <cit> , latent infection represents a huge reservoir for new tb cases.

at present, the main strategies pursued to improve tb control are more rapid case-finding, efficient drug treatment and the development of a new tb vaccine, more effective than the currently available mycobacterium bovis bacille calmette-guérin . there is therefore a pressing need to detect new tb antigens to set up sensitive immunological tests that may improve the identification of latent tb and to develop effective vaccines capable of activating the immune responses relevant for protection. a th1-type immune response, based on mhc class ii-restricted m. tuberculosis-specific cd4+ t cells producing ifn-γ, is considered essential for immunological containment of m. tuberculosis infection, although different immune cell subsets, such as αβ+ cd8+ or γδ+ t cells, or other unconventional t cells, namely cd1-restricted αβ+ t cells, contribute to immune protection  <cit> .

in the last years, our group has identified a novel antigen of m. tuberculosis, protein ppe <dig> , belonging to the "ppe proteins", a family of  <dig> polymorphic proteins of m. tuberculosis, defined on the basis of the amino acid  motif pro-pro-glu. together with the pe  proteins, they account for approximately 10% of the coding capacity of m. tuberculosis genome  <cit> . ppe proteins are characterized by a conserved nh2-terminus domain of approximately  <dig> aa residues and a c-terminal domain variable in sequence and length; although their role in m. tuberculosis infection is unknown, their polymorphic nature suggests that they represent antigens of immunological relevance  <cit> . in our past studies, we reported that infection of mice with bcg or with m. tuberculosis induced ppe44-specific humoral and cellular immune responses  <cit>  and, most importantly, vaccination of mice with ppe44-based subunit vaccines followed by an intratracheal challenge with virulent m. tuberculosis resulted in protective efficacy comparable to that afforded by bcg  <cit> . this finding makes ppe <dig> a promising antigen candidate for tb subunit vaccines.

in the present work, we evaluated the cellular immune response to ppe <dig> during mycobacterial infection by determining the t-cell response to ppe <dig> in a small cohort of subjects. moreover, by the use of synthetic peptides spanning the ppe <dig> molecule, we mapped a human immunodominant epitope potentially useful for the development of new subunit tb vaccines and immunological diagnosis of tb.

RESULTS
human t cell response to rppe44
we first determined the number of pbmc producing ifn-γ to recombinant ppe <dig>  by elispot in  <dig> ppd- ,  <dig> ppd+,  <dig> bcg-vaccinated subjects and  <dig> patients with active tb. as shown in figure 1a, no ifn-γ-secreting spots were observed in any but one ppd- healthy donors; two out of  <dig> subjects vaccinated with bcg responded to rppe <dig> by producing  <dig> and  <dig> spots per  <dig> ×  <dig> cells, respectively. all healthy ppd+ individuals responded to rppe <dig> yielding the highest numbers  of ifn-γ-secreting spots. importantly, for patients with active tb, the responders to rppe <dig>  as well as the numbers of ifn-γ sfu, were significantly lower  than ppd+ subjects, as only  <dig> of  <dig> responded to rppe <dig> yielding relatively few spots .

to ascertain that ppe44-specific responses were accounted by cd4+ t cells, we performed icc assays measuring the frequency of ppe44-specific cd4+ t cells producing ifn-γ. as shown in figure 1b, the frequency of ppe44-specific cd4+ t cells producing ifn-γ was lower than cut-off in all ppd- healthy donors;  <dig> out of  <dig> ppd+ healthy donors yielded the highest positive responses . these results probably reflect the lower sensitivity of flow cytometry compared to elispot, as shown by other authors as well  <cit> .

human t cell responses to ppe <dig> synthetic peptides
the next experiments were aimed at mapping ppe <dig> t-cell epitope by studying t-cell immune response in  <dig> of  <dig> ppd+ healthy volunteers used in previous experiment; the  <dig> subjects chosen tested positive to tuberculin-skin test and quantiferon tb gold test. donors' pbmc were stimulated with a panel of synthetic 20-mer peptides, most of which overlapped by  <dig> aa, spanning most of the  <dig> aa sequence of ppe <dig> and peptide-specific immune responses were then evaluated by elispot. as shown in figure  <dig>  pbmc from all the donors reacted with control rppe <dig>  as expected, generating numbers of ifn-γ-specific sfu ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> per  <dig> ×  <dig> cells; only one peptide, i.e., peptide p1l , spanning aa 1- <dig> of ppe <dig>  was efficiently recognized by pbmc from all the donors. with regards to the other peptides tested, one donor responded weakly to p6l, p9l, p11l, p12l, p21l, p22l and p30l, yielding  <dig> to  <dig> peptide-specific sfu per  <dig> ×  <dig> cells, while for the other donors spots were generally lower than  <dig> per  <dig> ×  <dig> cells or absent for all peptides other than p1l. no ifn-γ-positive spots were observed towards p18l , spanning aa 171- <dig>  in any of the donors tested. peptide p18l was therefore chosen as a negative control for subsequent experiments.

these results suggested that p1l represents an immunodominant t-cell epitope of protein ppe <dig> 

human t cell responses to p1l peptide
the t-cell immune response to p1l was then studied in ppd-, ppd+ and bcg-vaccinated healthy individuals and in patients with active tb by elispot and flow cytometry; ppd and esat- <dig> were included as controls. in ppd- healthy donors, practically no ifn-γ-producing cells were observed in response to p1l, ppd and esat- <dig>  as expected . conversely, all ppd+ healthy donors  yielded the highest numbers of ifn-γ-producing cells in response to p1l  and ppd ; among the ppd+ healthy donors,  <dig> out of  <dig> responded to esat- <dig>  and one donor responded to control peptide p18l  . a weak ifn-γ response was observed to peptide p1l  and antigen esat- <dig>  in one of the subjects vaccinated with bcg ; two subjects responded to ppd  and one subject responded to p18l . in the  <dig> patients with active tb , the response to p1l peptide was absent or very poor, as only one patient produced a number of ifn-γ-positive spots indicative of an immune response . the difference from ppd+ subjects is significant both in terms of proportion of responders and numbers of ifn-γ spots . among tb patients,  <dig> and  <dig> subjects responded to ppd and esat- <dig>  respectively, which is not statistically significant compared to the ppd+ group.

on the whole, results obtained by icc  were comparable to those obtained by elispot and confirmed that most ppd+ patients  had a detectable immune response to p1l peptide, while none of the patients with active tb exhibited a response to p1l peptide. again, although flow cytometry is less sensitive compared to elispot  <cit> , it proves that reacting subjects secrete ifn-γ via their cd4+ t cells. in the responders, the frequency of specific ifn-γ+ t cells was significantly higher than cut-off and reached levels of  <dig> %. among bcg-vaccinated donors, a weak response to p1l was observed in only one donor.

an example of the icc analysis for peptide p1l and rppe <dig> of pbmc obtained from a ppd+ donor is given in figure 5b-c. as can be seen, no reactivity was detected either against p1l, or against rppe <dig> in the cd4- population of cells. thus, p1l is recognized by all ppd+ healthy subjects tested by elispot and reactivity is accounted for by cd4+ cells.

discussion
the results reported in this paper show that an ifn-γ+ t cell immune response to ppe <dig> can be detected by elispot in all healthy individuals naturally ppd+ and, to a lower extent, in subjects vaccinated with bcg; cd4+ t lymphocytes account for ifn-γ secretion in ppe44-responder subjects, as shown by icc analysis. by the same approaches, our study has highlighted the presence of a strong cd4+ t-cell epitope in the nh2-terminus of the ppe <dig> molecule localized at the aa position 1- <dig>  conversely, no significant ifn-γ+ cd4+ t cell response to ppe <dig> or its immunodominant peptide p1l could be detected in most patients  with newly diagnosed active tb.

the ppe <dig> immunodominat t-cell epitope detected in the present study has been previously reported as the antigenic target of an il-2-induced ifn-γ+ response in mice in which immunization with ppe44-subunit vaccines conferred protective immunity in an experimental model of tb  <cit> . the data reported in this paper suggest that ifn-γ+ t-cell responses to ppe <dig> may be associated to immune protection also in human m. tuberculosis infection: indeed, ifn-γ+ t-cells specific for the immunodominant ppe <dig> peptide p1l were detectable in all individuals whose immune system is likely to have determined the containment of infection and prevented progression to active tb disease , as well as in a proportion of bcg-vaccinated subjects. on the other hand, most patients with active tb, i.e., those individuals whose immune system failed to contain tb infection, did not respond to ppe <dig> or p1l. in this respect, however, it has to be considered that tb patients enrolled in our study were under tb chemotherapy, which might have decreased the m. tuberculosis-specific ifn-γ responses  <cit> ; another explanation might be that ppe44-specific t cells are sequestered at the site of mycobacterial replication, usually the lung. alternatively, it is tempting to speculate that the poor t-cell immune responsiveness of tb patients to p1l might be related to a dynamic antigen display due to differential expression of ppe <dig> during active infection; indeed, in a previous paper, we reported great variations in the expression of the gene coding for ppe <dig> among m. tuberculosis isolates and that only about one third of patients with active tb produced antibodies to ppe <dig>  <cit> . a last attractive hypothesis could be that a t cell response to p1l/ppe <dig> helpes individuals to contain tb infection, while those who do not mount such a response are more prone to develop active disease.

one of the promising features of p1l is that it was recognized by all  <dig> ppd+ healthy individuals tested, as shown by elispot, suggesting that p1l is most probably able to bind a number of human hla-dr alleles. it also proved to be immunodominant in two different species, being a t-cell epitope also in the c57bl/ <dig> strain of mice  <cit> . "promiscuous" helper peptides are peptides that can bind a wide range of mhc class ii alleles. within their sequence, they typically have a motif, called p1-p <dig>  where position  <dig> can be an aromatic or a hydrophobic aa whereas position  <dig> can be a small or hydrophobic aa  <cit> . indeed, such motif can be found in  <dig> positions in p1l, namely 1- <dig>  3- <dig> and 10- <dig>  promiscuous peptides have been searched for and described both in mycobacterial antigens  <cit>  and in other antigens, such as the malarial circumsporozoite protein  <cit> . they allow to overcome the problem of the high degree of polymorphism of the hla-dr molecules expressed in the human population and for such a reason they are ideal candidates for subunit vaccine design and as diagnostic tools. to this aim, future studies will attempt to establish the hla class ii restriction elements binding p1l.

two other ppe proteins of m. tuberculosis have proven capable of inducing protection against m. tuberculosis in experimental models, namely i) the ppe <dig> , that has shown promising vaccine potential in human clinical trials  <cit> , and ii) the ppe <dig> , that is a component of the subunit vaccine mtb72f. the latter has recently been investigated in clinical trials showing good tolerability and immunogenicity in humans  <cit> . dillon et al.  <cit>  have reported proliferative response towards aa 1- <dig> of ppe <dig> in pbmc from ppd-positive human subjects, that is exactly the ppe region were our studies have mapped the cd4+ t-cell epitope. indeed, the immunodominant p1l domain shows  <dig> to 85% aa homology with the corresponding sequences of  <dig> ppe proteins of m. tuberculosis and, in particular, p1l shares  <dig> identical aa with the nh2-terminal 20-aa sequence of the protective antigens ppe <dig> and ppe <dig>  these observations raise the possibility that cross-reactivity might have contributed to the strong immunogenicity of the conserved and homologous nh2-terminal regions of the ppe proteins. these considerations make ppe proteins, especially their immunodominant nh2-terminal domains, promising antigen candidates for tb subunit vaccine development.

latent tb infection is conventionally screened for by the more-than-100-year-old tuberculin skin test, that measures in vivo reactivity to tuberculin or ppd, a mixture of mycobacterial antigens, some of which common to non-tuberculous mycobacteria and to the vaccine strain m. bovis bcg. recently, assays based on release of ifn-γ by pbmc exposed in vitro to m. tuberculosis-specific antigens, such as esat- <dig> and cfp- <dig>  have emerged as attractive specific alternatives to tuberculin skin test to distinguish between m. tuberculosis infection and bcg vaccination/reactivity to non-tuberculous mycobacteria  <cit> . however, the sensitivity of both tuberculin skin test and ifn-γ-release assays is suboptimal, and none of these tests distinguish between latent infection and active disease  <cit> . in this context, ppe <dig> might turn out as a useful reagent for the immunological diagnosis of latent tb and p1l could prove even more useful than the whole recombinant protein becauset cell reactivity, especially in thawed pbmc, has often been reported to be higher towards synthetic peptides than to recombinant proteins  <cit> . our data indicate that a ppe44- or p1l-specific ifn-γ+ t cell-response occurs in naturally ppd+ individuals, who are likely to harbour latent tb infection, and in a proportion of bcg vaccinees tested, but it is not detectable in most of our patients with active tb. these results, although very preliminary, would make p1l a good candidate, in association with the other tb-specific antigens available, to distinguish between latent infection and active disease.

CONCLUSIONS
the present report identifies p1l  as an immunodominant promiscuous peptide that is worth studiyng further both as a vaccine component and as a diagnostic reagent.
