BACKGROUND
dendritic cells  participate in a wide spectrum of immune cell functions including antigen-presentation, phagocytic activity and t cell-mediated immunities  <cit> . currently, a number of experimental approaches are being evaluated to develop dc-based immunotherapy and gene-based tumor vaccine strategies to elicit specific immunities against specific cancers  or infectious diseases  <cit> . dcs can capture and take up antigens present in peripheral tissue and transport them to primary and secondary lymphoid tissue for presentation to t cells  <cit> . therefore, extensive research regarding cell migration, homing, and the cellular fate of dcs in various tissue systems is considered a critical issue. research on mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells  has shown the importance of using experimental models for research into dc-based therapeutics  <cit> . we recently reported the effect and possible application of echinacea purpurea  phytocompounds as immune-modifiers for human dcs using functional genomic and proteomic approaches  <cit> . here, we extended our study to the mouse dc system, and investigated the effects of the chemically defined ep phyto-extracts  on immunomodulatory activity and cell migration/trafficking activities of dcs under ex vivo and in vivo conditions.

since the 1990s, the use of echinacea spp. as a medicinal plant or food supplement has gained popularity in the usa and europe  <cit> , and is now even recognized in asia . the possible effects of echinacea spp. extracts on in vitro activation of macrophages, natural killer  cells, and other immune cell types  <cit> , and on stimulating the expression of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha , interferon, interleukin- <dig> and interleukin- <dig>  <cit>  have all been reported. in vivo studies showed that treatment with echinacea extracts can increase white blood cell populations in the circulation system  <cit> , and enhance phagocytosis  <cit> . e. purpurea extracts have been evaluated in clinical trials for efficiency against the common cold, but the controversial results are continuously disputed  <cit> . to systemically assess the immunomodulatory effects on mouse dcs in vivo, we employed a chemically defined echinacea purpurea extract, termed , containing hypoxanthine, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, cichoric acid, quercetin-3-o-rhamnosyl- -galactoside, kaempferol-3-o-rhamnosyl--galactoside and rutin  <cit> .

profiling of specific and global gene expression patterns by dna microarray analysis coupled with proteomic analysis provides a useful approach for the investigation of complex biological phenomena  <cit>  as we have previously shown for immune cell systems  <cit> . in this study, we used a network knowledge-based approach to analyze genome-wide transcriptome activity in vitro and in vivo, for correlation to specific proteome activities and special functional phenotypes in mouse immature bmdcs, in response to treatment with . our findings suggest that  was able to modulate cell adhesion-, cell mobility-, cytokine- and nf-κb signaling-related activities in primary cultures of mouse dcs. in vivo trafficking experiments using ex vivo-treated dcs demonstrated that  could enhance the mobility of dcs to target specific lymphoid organs in test mouse. moreover, bioinformatics studies allowed us to predict several candidate target molecules for the future translational studies of this or other phytocompound mixtures. the significance of our findings and potential application to future studies of human dcs are discussed.

RESULTS
 <dig>  expression of dc markers in response to treatment with 
initially, we set out to examine whether  could influence the maturation activity of bmdcs. mouse bone marrow cells were isolated and cultured for  <dig> days in rpmi- <dig> supplemented with  <dig> u/ml gm-csf. dcs cultured in the presence of gm-csf showed the functional and phenotypic characteristics of the immature stage and could be further differentiated in vitro into mature dcs. lps, at  <dig> μg/ml, was then used to induce maturation of dcs. some test cells were analyzed for the effect of  for  <dig> h. since concentrations of  greater than  <dig> μg/ml were slightly cytotoxic to test dendritic cells ,  was used at a concentration of  <dig> μg/ml, where no cytotoxicity was detectable. as seen in figure  <dig>  sharp peak signals were obtained in flow cytometry analyses, demonstrating that high quality dcs were routinely obtained. flow cytometry analysis on the expression of cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  mhc class ii and cd11c on bmdcs showed that the control group expressed lower levels of co-stimulatory and activation molecules than the lps-treated groups. there was no significant difference between the dmso-treated and -treated groups . compared with the lps group, bmdcs co-treated with  <dig> μg/ml  and  <dig> μg/ml lps only showed a weak inhibition of cd <dig> at  <dig> h post-lps treatment, whereas expression of cd <dig>  cd <dig>  mhc class ii and cd11c were not significantly affected. these data indicate that  did not have a significant effect on the phenotypic maturation of mouse bmdcs.

 <dig>  differential gene expression in immature bmdcs as a response to treatment with 
we next investigated the expression of specific genes related to the cellular biochemistry and physiology of immature dcs. affymetrix dna microarray analyses showed that, although the gene expression of the cell surface markers tested above were not affected, a series of other genes related to dc activities were affected by  <dig> μg/ml . initial experimental setups using biological sample replicates showed that our test cell culture systems and experimental protocols, e.g., rna preparation, were highly reproducible and consistent, e.g., pearson's correlation values for test biological sample replicates were between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . all genes identified from the raw data of our affymetrix gene chip analyses were subjected to a gene filtering proctocol, using established statistics software , to select and identify candidate differentially expressed genes for further studies. we chose genes that scored positive in at least  <dig> different chips and that had a coefficient of variation  of over  <dig> . a total of  <dig> and  <dig> genes had changed expression significantly by  <dig> h and by  <dig> h post-treatment with , respectively. among these,  <dig> and  <dig> genes respectively were identified as immune-related genes . for up-regulated or down-regulated genes, only those genes that showed at least a 2-fold change in rna transcript level in two independent experiments were considered for further analysis. differences in expression level were calculated by dividing the signal intensity values of genes from -treated cells by the intensity values of genes from the vehicle-treated  cells. overall, similar numbers of genes were up-regulated and down-regulated after treatment with  . the expression of  <dig> genes more than doubled in -treated dcs, compared to vehicle control, at  <dig> h post-treatment, and a group of  <dig> genes were up-regulated  at  <dig> h post-treatment. in contrast,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were down-regulated  in -treated dcs at  <dig> h and  <dig> h post-treatment, respectively . it is important to note that two different sets of  <dig> non-immune related genes were highly affected at  <dig> h and  <dig> h time points . the relative changes in gene expression levels in -treated dcs are shown in table  <dig> and table  <dig> for  <dig> h and  <dig> h treatments, respectively. the unknown genes and sequences are not shown in these tables.

a number of genes that are reported to be differentially expressed in defined immune responses were found to have increased expression after treatment with   <cit> . these genes include angiomotin , chemokine  ligand  <dig> , pro-platelet basic protein  and immunoresponsive gene  <dig>  which were up-regulated at  <dig> h post-treatment with , and other genes including cytotoxic t-lymphocyte-associated protein  <dig>  and chemokine  ligand  <dig>  were strongly up-regulated at  <dig> h post-treatment. among them, cxcl <dig> was up-regulated at both  <dig> h and  <dig> h time points . in addition, the expression of dc surface marker genes, such as cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  mhc ii and cd11c, showed little or no changes after  treatment, confirming our previous flow cytometric analysis .

a number of the responsive genes found here have not previously been shown to be differentially expressed in dcs. some of these include specific cell surface molecules related to cell adhesion or to regulation of cytoskeleton molecules, such as cadherin  <dig> , cadherin  <dig> , integrin a <dig> , neural cell adhesion molecule  <dig> , microtubule-associated protein  <dig> , cd <dig>  and gap junction protein alpha  <dig> . rna transcript levels for genes encoding several secreted proteins were also increased by treatment with . these genes include chemokine  ligand  <dig> , pro-platelet basic protein  ligand 7) , acid phosphatase , chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan  <dig> , matrix metallopeptidase  <dig> , and serpin peptidase inhibitor . in comparison, the expression of transcripts encoding several enzymes fell after treatment with . these genes included protein kinase c , acyl-coa synthetase , st <dig> alpha-n-acetyl-neuraminide alpha- <dig> -sialyltransferase  <dig> , and src-like-adaptor . moreover, the expression of mrnas encoding transcription factors or dna binding proteins localized in the nuclear compartment, such as ankyrin repeat and socs box-containing  <dig>  and inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in b-cells , were increased in -treated dcs, and the expressions other transcription regulatory genes, such as synaptonemal complex protein  <dig> , rna binding motif protein  <dig> , hect domain containing  <dig>  and sry -box  <dig>  were decreased .

 <dig>  putative signaling networks involved in modulatory effect of  on ibmdcs
functional genomics experimental approaches were employed in our previous study on the modulatory effect of echinacea plant extracts on human dcs  <cit> . using the same defined phytocompound extracts here we analyzed the genome-wide transcriptional response in the context of known functional activities and interrelationships among specific protein molecules and/or different cell phenotypes by using ingenuity systems, a structured network knowledge-based approach, to provide insight into the regulation of bmdc activities that are relevant to the body immune system. figure 3a shows the hypothetical or candidate networks revealed by clustering analysis of representative genes involved in the bmdc response to  treatment. apparent temporal controls for coordination of specific gene expressions were classified into three different functional groups: the immune response related genes ; adhesion molecules, cytoskeleton and cell movement-related genes ; and the cell cycle, cell proliferation, and apoptosis-related genes . these responses to treatment with  extract in ibmdcs may be viewed as an integrated cell-wide response involving cell trafficking, attachment, immunity and apoptosis.

to identify possible signal transduction pathways in response to  treatment, we analyzed, for both the  <dig> h and  <dig> h treatments, the  <dig> up-regulated genes using transpath software in the manner previously reported  <cit> . signal transduction pathways involving the crbp <dig>  ahr, apc and cyr <dig> genes with a ≥ 2-fold change in expression level  were predicted. apparent signaling network and functional genomic analyses suggest that treatment of dcs with  may activate the jnk, pp2c-α, akt, erk1/ <dig> or mapkapk pathways, because expression of their downstream genes were up-regulated . for those down-regulated genes, the transpath software was not able to predict a matched upstream pathway.

 <dig>  identification of differentially expressed known or novel proteins in bmdcs that respond to 
using 2d gel electrophoresis, we were able to routinely obtain representative, high resolution, and highly reproducible 2d protein profiles of mouse dcs as putative proteomic maps . treatment of dcs with  at  <dig> μg/ml resulted in significant changes in expression of some proteins in comparison to the solvent-treated mouse dc samples. differentially-expressed proteins were then identified by maldi-tof-ms and in some cases subsequently analyzed with tandem ms/ms, after manual excision of these protein spots from gels. a total of  <dig> different known protein species were isolated and characterized by analysis with maldi-tof-ms peptide mass fingerprinting . table  <dig> lists the changes in protein expression in dcs treated with  in vitro for  <dig> h, as compared to solvent  treatment . expression of metabolism, cytoskeleton or nf-κb-signaling related proteins were most affected by . 2d gel electrophoretic analyses showed increased levels of a group of specific proteins, such as annexin a <dig> and peroxiredoxin . in contrast, the levels of some other proteins, such as macrophage capping protein, were reduced . these proteins, which function in cytoskeleton organization, did not show a detectable change in mrna levels after  treatment.

 <dig>  effect of  extract on bmdc trafficking
the effect of  on dc mobility was evaluated by an in vivo dc trafficking assay. primary bmdcs generated by in vitro culture were treated with  <dig> % dmso,  or lps separately. cells were then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer i  and administered to test mice via i.v. injection. after  <dig> h, mice were sacrificed and dc motilities in vivo were compared by scoring the presence and number of dcs with green fluorescence dye in tissue sections of inguinal lymph node, spleen and liver. as seen in figure  <dig>  dcs treated with  showed a higher capacity to target lymph nodes and spleen  than dmso-treated dcs . in comparison, dcs stimulated by lps showed a relatively higher capacity to target these immune tissues, particularly the spleen . tissues from liver of all test mice remained negative for trafficking of dcs throughout the tested experimental period . these data indicate that the echinacea extract can stimulate enhanced migration and mobility of dcs in vivo, in addition to its specific effect on the transcriptome seen in vitro.

as shown in the insets of d and e in figure  <dig>  for -treated dcs, the individual cellular events of dc migration, are seen mainly as separated, single unit fluorescent dots in the photomicrographs of test tissues, and the fluorescence intensities are, in general, medium to low. in contrast, the cellular behavior and light intensities of the fluorescent test dcs in lps-treated samples  are more aggregated and clumped together. in addition the colors are considerably brighter than those seen for the -treated dcs. it was also observed that under in vitro test conditions, the individual dcs treated with lps became enlarged in size, and thus could apparently absorb higher levels of fitc-labeled dextran and also already tended to aggregate together, as compared to dcs treated with . these effects of lps may also contribute to the observed results seen in trafficking experiments, where more aggregated and brighter dcs were detected in targeted tissues in lps-treated dcs than in cells treated with .

the potential effect of  on key cellular physiological functions of dcs was further investigated in an in vitro study, where the expression of specific chemotaxis-related receptors for trafficking of dcs was analyzed by flow cytometry. bmdcs with or without lps stimulation were treated with  for  <dig> h and then assayed for expression of the three cell surface markers ccr <dig>  ccr <dig> and ccr <dig> , which are known to play an important role in the mobility of dcs, are expressed on dcs at distinguishable differentiation stages, and are located at specific sites in different tissues  <cit> . here, ccr4+ccr5+ and ccr4+ccr7+ dendritic cells were considered as immature and mature dc populations, respectively, as observed during their in vivo maturation processes. our data show that in vitro treatment of dcs with  significantly increases the expression level of ccr <dig> on immature dcs . considering our prior results obtained both in vitro  and in vivo , the data shown in figure  <dig> thus confirm our current key finding that the -enhanced dc trafficking ability appears to be readily distinguishable from the lps-induced dc mobility.

discussion
by using a combination of genomic and proteomic experimental approaches, we investigated the ex vivo effects of a candidate medicinal plant extract, , on the differentiation and modulation activities of mouse bmdcs. this study extends our previous report  <cit> , where human dcs were used in a similar functional genomics study. in addition to the ex vivo test system, this study also examined the in vivo effect of  in experimental mice. together, our current and previous findings on both human and mouse dcs, under in vitro as well as in vivo conditions, have provided us with a comprehensive information base for future translational research into potential clinical application of  as botanical drugs or nutritional supplements. as demonstrated in fig  <dig>  our dna microarray test systems and the experimental cell culture replicate samples were highly reproducible and consistent. we identified that close to  <dig> % of the genes from the bmdc genome are significantly affected by treatment with . these differentially expressed and responsive genes were mostly related to cell adhesion and motility, immune response, signaling molecules and specialty enzymes. some of these genes have been previously reported to be related to functions of dcs, but a large portion are reported here for the first time.

in this study, flow cytometry analysis on a number of cd markers showed that expression of several mouse dc surface markers was not significantly affected by treatment with , this finding was not consistent with our previous data for human dcs  <cit> . this result may suggest that specific biochemical and cellular effects of herbal extract on dc maturation may vary considerably between different mammalian species, implying that future translation of experimental findings or results from animal models into human application need to be carefully addressed and considered with multiple references.

immature dcs migrate from the blood to other tissues where they take up and process target antigens. such dcs then subsequently migrate to the draining lymphoid tissues, resulting in the priming of naïve t cells following antigen presentation. during their migration, dcs are known to be involved in several adhesion or cognition events. for instance, e-cadherin, which is uniquely expressed by langerhans dcs , permits the residence of lcs in the epidermis  <cit> . such antigen encounter can result in down-regulation of e-cadherin that allows lc migration out of the skin  <cit> . the release of collagenase by dcs can facilitate their migration through the basement membranes  <cit> . our data show that the gene expressing e-cadherin was down-regulated in dcs at both  <dig> h and  <dig> h after treatment with . genes encoding for the cell adhesion protein integrin alpha  <dig>  and the cell signaling protein gap junction membrane channel protein α <dig>  were down-regulated at  <dig> h and  <dig> h post treatment, respectively. moreover, expression of specific collagenases and proteases, such as mmp- <dig> , mmp- <dig>  and mmp- <dig>  and the macrophage elastase mmp- <dig>  were appearently up-regulated after  <dig> h of treatment. taking these results together, and in conjunction with the in vivo trafficking assay data , we suggest that  phytoextract can confer a modulatory effect on cell mobility of mouse bmdcs. in future studies it will be important and interesting to determine whether such an in vivo effect is also observed for human dcs, and thus for potential clinical application.

in general, various major inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines such as il- <dig>  tnf-α, ifnγ, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  which are readily induced by injury or infection, are known to stimulate the production of a spectrum of different chemokines though mediation via their respective receptors  <cit> . for instance, it is known that mice deficient in ccr <dig>  the only known ccl <dig> receptor, have impaired th <dig> responses  <cit> , owing to a reduction of monocyte trafficking to the sites of inflammation  <cit> . in this study we show that a number of immune-related genes were up-regulated after  <dig> h and  <dig> h treatment of . these include genes encoding angiomotin , which is involved in cell movement and embryogenesis  <cit> , chemokine  ligand  <dig> , pro-platelet basic protein , involved in chemokine activity and leukocyte transendothelial migration  <cit> , immunoresponsive gene  <dig>  and cytotoxic t-lymphocyte-associated protein  <dig> . these results suggest that  may modify the chemotactic behavior of mouse dcs. since some responsive chemokines such as cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig>  which we detected here in test dcs, are currently not well defined in terms of cellular function and biochemistry, further studies are needed to examine how  can exert an effect on the secretion of these chemokines and to find out whether these chemokines do play a role in the chemoattraction and trafficking of treated dcs in the mouse system. on the other hand, our in vitro study did allow us to show that phenotypic expression of chemotaxis-related receptor proteins, including ccr <dig> and ccr <dig>  can be significantly regulated in test mouse dcs treated with  . whether or not specific chemotaxis-related receptors, such as ccr <dig>  can mechanistically modulate the -enhanced dc mobility will also require further investigations. unlike our previous findings on human dcs  <cit> ,  treatment had a readily distinguishable and a slower level effect on the expression of immune-related genes in mouse bmdcs. these results again suggest, like the effects observed for cell surface marker proteins, the immunomodulatory effects of phytocompounds from echinacea extracts apparently could also differ substantially between humans and mice.

it is well known that dcs are the principal antigen presenting cells  for t-cell priming  <cit> . it is important to note, however, that dcs are also involved in the induction of central and peripheral tolerance  <cit> . one protein, called cytotoxic t lymphocyte-associated antigen  <dig> , is known as an immunomodulatory membrane molecule. by decreasing t-cell responsiveness and raising the threshold for t-cell activation, ctla- <dig> plays a critical role in the maintenance of peripheral t-cell tolerance  <cit> . here, we found that the expression of ctla <dig> was drastically up-regulated in dcs after  <dig> h of treatment with . whether the ctla- <dig> signaling system for dcs were also affected by our test phyto-compound and could in turn further affect t cell or other dc associated immunities would need to be further analyzed in future studies.

in human dcs, we showed that  can effect the expression of specific cytoskeleton proteins, including macrophage-capping protein, cofilin, profilin, f-actin capping protein β subunit, and laminin a/c  <cit> . in the present study using mouse dc cells, our 2d gel electrophoretic analyses on dc proteins revealed that expression of several cytoskeleton-related proteins, such as alpha-actin- <dig> and f-actin capping protein alpha and macrophage capping protein, were also altered by . these results together suggest that ep phytocompound extract modulates specific cytoskeleton functions, which are known to play a role in testing dcs to specific immune processes. a group of specific proteins, such as annexin a <dig>  which can reversibly modify various membrane properties , anchoring of cytoskeletal elements, aggregation of vesicles, and the regulation of ion conductance  <cit> , and peroxiredoxin  <dig>  which exhibits thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase activity and regulates the activation of the transcription factor nf-κb  <cit> , were up-regulated in mouse dcs after treatment with  . these results suggest again that  may affect the cell mobility and nf-κb signaling of bmdcs. moreover, expression of several cellular metabolism-related proteins, including vimentin, proliferin- <dig> precursor- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  phenylalanyl-trna synthetase, phosphoglycerate mutase  <dig>  cathepsin s, nucleoside diphosphate kinase and alpha-enolase were also affecteded by  treatment . whether these changes are functionally related to specific cellular and molecular activities of mouse dcs needs to be further investigated.

previous studies have demonstrated that specific alkylamides of e. purpurea can effectively stimulate macrophage function in healthy rats or raw  <dig>  cells  <cit> . in addition, specific in vitro effects of echinacea extract and several of its phytochemical components on nf-κb expression in jurkat cells  have been reported  <cit> . recently we reported that phytocompounds from e. purpurea extracts could affect specific cell-surface marker expressions and cytoskeleton rearrangement in treated human dcs  <cit> . these findings suggest that a spectrum of specific immunomodulatory effects in dcs can be modulated by phytochemicals from e. purpurea at the cellular level. it is interesting to find that in this study, although the specific groups of responsive rna transcripts and proteins seem to differ substantially from the results obtained from our previous studies on human dcs, the end result in terms of cellular functions seems to suggest that many of them, such as cytoskeleton-associated gene or protein expression can in fact be quite similar, and this provides valuable correlated information for future evaluations of the various molecular mechanisms of these effects. the in vivo dc trafficking results obtained in this study may further suggest the importance of the mobility and cytoskeletal components of the differentially expressed transcriptome for future evaluation of pharmaco-genomics activities in a mouse dc system in vivo. besides, we believe that our current transient labeling system for dcs may provide future application to translational research on phytochemical or herbal medicinal effect on dcs.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, data obtained from both in vitro transcriptomic analyses and in vivo dc trafficking assays suggested that  treatment can affect dc mobility. the effects of this bioactive herbal extract on expression of cytoskeleton-related rna transcripts as well as on differential protein expressions related to cell adherence and other dc functions add complementary and supportive information to our previous studies on human dcs  <cit> . taken together, our research shows that this candidate herbal medicine may cause drastic modulatory effects on specific immune cells  by regulating key cellular behaviors. in addition, bioinformatics studies from this and our previous study  <cit>  have revealed a group of candidate target molecules and signaling networks, for example the jnk, pp2c-α, akt and mapkapk pathways, that we believe warrant future systematic studies as key targets for immunomodulatory phytomedicines, via mediation with dendritic cells.
