BACKGROUND
mulberry , an important feed crop for silkworms, is widely cultivated throughout subtropical and temperate regions in the world. however, the crop is susceptible to a number of diseases throughout the year  <cit> . these diseases can lead to deterioration of leaf quality, and consumption of infected leaves by silkworm larvae adversely affects their development and cocoon characters  <cit> . mulberry anthracnose, caused by colletotrichum dematium, is a commonly observed disease and has become a serious threat to the production and quality of mulberry leaves in susceptible varieties  <cit>  and thus a major problem in mulberry cultivation. as silkworms are reared on mulberry leaves, improper use of agrochemicals to treat the disease could be hazardous to the worms. therefore, the use of agrochemicals has not gained wide acceptance in mulberry gardens, and the need for alternative techniques that are safe to silkworms is acutely felt. biological control of plant pathogens using antagonistic bacteria is a promising strategy and has attracted considerable attention in the efforts to reduce the use of agricultural chemicals  <cit> .

endophytic bacteria are those that colonize plant tissues internally without showing any external symptoms or negative effects on their host  <cit> . research has shown the potential of endophytic bacteria as biocontrol and plant-growth-promoting agents  <cit> . the burkholderia cepacia complex  is a diverse group of bacteria commonly found in soil, water, and the rhizosphere; on bodies of animal including humans; and in the hospital environment  <cit> . as endophytic bacteria, members of bcc have been isolated from a few crops such as sweet corn, cotton, rice, yellow lupine, and sugarcane  <cit> , and b. cepacia strains have proved useful as antagonists of plant pests and in increasing the yield of several crop plants  <cit> .

strain lu10- <dig> of b. cepacia  is an antagonistic endophyte originally isolated from mulberry  leaves  <cit> ; however, no attempt has been made to use b. cepacia for controlling c. dematium infection in mulberry nor its colonization patterns have been studied using gfp reporter or other reporters. the objectives of this study were to evaluate the antifungal and plant-growth-promoting properties of lu10- <dig>  to clarify its specific localization within a mulberry plant, and to better understand its potential as a biocontrol and growth-promoting agent.

RESULTS
antifungal activity of strain lu10- <dig> against c. dematium in vitro
when c. dematium and lu10- <dig> bacteria were co-cultured on the same pda plate, a distinct zone of inhibition was observed around the bacterial inoculum . microscopic observation of the hyphae growing close to lu10- <dig> colonies showed changes in hyphal morphology such as excessive branching, irregular swelling, curling of hyphal tips, and disruption of apical growth. mycelium from the co-cultures showed coagulation of cytoplasm, degradation of the mycelium, and large vesicles inside the cell walls . fig.  <dig> shows the germination rate of conidia suspended in cell-free culture supernatant fluid , undiluted and in a series of dilutions. no conidia could germinate in suspensions containing cfcsf diluted up to 24-fold; at dilutions higher than that, the inhibitory effect decreased, and ceased altogether when the cfcsf was diluted 96-fold.

biological control of lu10- <dig> against mulberry anthracnose in a greenhouse
to assess the effect of lu10- <dig> on the anthracnose on mulberry leaves, the bacteria were applied to inoculated and uninoculated leaves or to the soil at different times before or after inoculation with c. dematium. when lu10- <dig> was applied to inoculated leaves before or up to  <dig> days after inoculation, the appearance of anthracnose symptoms was significantly suppressed but not when it was applied  <dig> days after inoculation . it is particularly noteworthy that the symptoms were also suppressed when lu10- <dig> was applied to uninoculated leaves or to the soil. in this case too, the degree of suppression varied with the length of the gap between the lu10- <dig> treatment and the inoculation , the effective interval being more than  <dig> days in the case of leaves and one day in the case of soil; intervals longer than these did not result in greater suppression. thus, it can be seen that strain lu10- <dig> proved to be an effective biological control agent against anthracnose of mulberry in greenhouses, and that the strain's effectiveness varied with the length of the interval between the strain treatment and inoculation with the pathogen.

survival of rifampicin-streptomycin-tolerant mutants of lu10- <dig> in soils
to quantify the survival of rifampicin-streptomycin-tolerant mutants of lu10- <dig>  in soils, lum10- <dig> strains were re-isolated from sterile and non-sterile soils at different times after the application . in sterile soil, over  <dig> days following the application, the number of bacteria decreased from the initial level of  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu g- <dig> soil to  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu g- <dig> soil. in non-sterile soils, the decrease was both greater and faster. beyond  <dig> days, the numbers from both soils remained relatively constant, although significantly higher in the sterile soil. overall, the lum10- <dig> strain could survive in both sterile and non-sterile soils and its population level remained stable for a long time.

growth-promoting effects of lu10- <dig> on mulberry seedlings
all mulberry seedlings could survive in soils treated with lu10- <dig>  seven days after the treatment, the growth of seedlings in the treated soil was not significantly different  from that in untreated soil. however,  <dig> days and  <dig> days after the treatment, growth was significantly better  in the treated soils: the seedlings were taller and the fresh weight of roots and of whole seedlings was greater. no significant differences were found between the seedlings in sterile and non-sterile soils . the results indicate significant growth-promoting effect of strain lu10- <dig> on mulberry seedlings.

 the same letters within a column mean that no significant differences exist between the numbers; the values are the means of all the seedlings sampled.

quantification of endophytic population of lum10- <dig> in mulberry seedlings
to quantify the endophytic population, lum10- <dig> was re-isolated from surface-disinfected roots, stems, and leaves of mulberry seedlings . the results showed that the bacteria could be re-isolated from surface-sterilized roots and stems on the 7th day after inoculation, implying that the bacteria could successfully establish their presence in roots and stems within  <dig> days. in the case of leaves, it took  <dig> days after inoculation, indicating that the bacteria had spread from roots to leaves. even  <dig> days after inoculation, the bacteria could be recovered from all parts of the plants, and no damage to the plants was visible. the results of monitoring the growth inside the plants are as follows. the number of bacteria increased initially and fell later, ultimately stabilizing at 1- <dig> ×  <dig> cfu per gram of fresh plant tissue. the control seedlings did not yield bacterial colonies when their surface-disinfected roots, leaves, and stems were plated on rifampicin and streptomycin nutrient agar. the above results show that strain lu10- <dig> is an endophyte and can spread systemically within mulberry seedling.

infection sites of lu10- <dig> in mulberry seedlings
microscopic observations revealed that the rhizoplane of mulberry seedlings had been colonized by lu10- <dig> cells within  <dig> h of lu10- <dig> inoculation of both primary and secondary roots . the bacteria had colonized the root surfaces in the differentiation, elongation, and root hair zones, as well as the sites from which lateral roots emerge. however, the population density of the bacteria varied with the site: in the root hair zone, the bacterial cells were distributed mainly along the root hair and at the points of their emergence whereas only a few bacteria were observed on the surface of root epidermal cells . it is remarkable that some bacteria were found to have entered the cortex directly through the epidermis in this zone . we also found that junctions between the primary and the secondary roots had been heavily colonized, indicating that the bacteria enter the roots through the fissures or cracks that are present at the site of emergence of lateral roots and of the radicle . in the elongation zone, surfaces of epidermal cells had been heavily colonized, and the bacteria had formed large cell aggregates , indicating that the elongation zone is another major point of entry. compared to the elongation zone, the bacteria were sparse in the root meristematic zone, and only single bacterial cells were found within the depressions between adjacent epidermal cells . similarly, only a few bacterial cells were found on the surface of root tips, a major point of entry into roots for many other microorganisms   <cit> . some lu10- <dig> bacteria were also observed within the cracks and depressions formed between epidermal cells of primary roots , which is another major entry point for many microorganisms  <cit> . higher magnifications  revealed that numerous cells of lu10- <dig> had colonized the area beneath the root epidermis, but none was found in the epidermal cells. no bacterial cell was observed anywhere on the roots  of the control seedlings. there was no obvious difference between observation taken  <dig> h and  <dig> h after inoculation .

infection process of gfp-tagged lu10- <dig> cells in mulberry seedlings
gfp-labelled lu10- <dig> was constructed by transferring an escherichia coli - bacillus cereus shuttle vector containing the gfp  gene into lu10- <dig>  the labelled lu10- <dig> cells emit green fluorescence with excitation and emission wavelengths of  <dig> and  <dig> nm, respectively, and could be detected by confocal laser scanning microscopy. after  <dig> generations in the absence of antibiotic pressure, 65% of the bacteria retained gfp fluorescence, and the expression of gfp did not delay the growth of the transformed strain significantly, which made them suitable for localization studies. the roots, stems, and leaves of mulberry seedlings were optically sectioned at different times after inoculation with gfp-labelled lu10- <dig>  and examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope. one day after inoculation, the bacterial cells were found to have colonized the surface of the primary roots in the zones of root hair and elongation, and only a few labelled cells were detected in the zones of differentiation and root tip . however, labelled lu10- <dig> cells were found in large numbers along the root hair  and also at the junctions of lateral roots with the main root . these results were consistent with the findings observed using the scanning electron microscope  and confirmed that these bacteria congregate at many entry sites along the length of the root. three days after inoculation, the bacteria were found in the intercellular spaces of cortical parenchyma of the primary root, and no bacterium was found inside the cells . these results are the same as those observed by sem. the bacteria could be detected in the inner cortex five days after inoculation , and could penetrate the pith of the primary root in the next two days . at this time, the bacteria were found in the form of cell aggregates in these root tissues, indicating that the process of root infection was complete. eleven days after inoculation, the bacteria were found in xylem vessels of the stem, indicating that the bacteria had migrated from the root to the stem . twenty days after inoculation, the bacteria were found in leaf veins , indicating that the bacterial cells had invaded the leaf. thirty days after inoculation, the bacteria were observed in the intercellular spaces of leaves, but no bacterium was found inside the cells . in contrast, no gfp-labelled lu10- <dig> cells were found in the control plants. in summary, our experiments show that the gfp-labelled bacterial cells infect the roots at the zones of differentiation and elongation and through the cracks formed at the junctions between lateral roots and the main root and penetrate the cortex, xylem, and pith. the bacteria can migrate from roots to stems and leaves, and are confined mainly to intercellular spaces.

siderophore and indole-3-acetic acid  production, phosphate solubilization, and nitrogenase activity
both the qualitative determination of siderophore production and phosphate-solubilizing capacity of lu10- <dig> on a solid medium showed positive results, indicating that lu10- <dig> can produce siderophores and solubilize phosphates. the rate of nitrogenase activity was  <dig>  μmol c2h <dig> mg protein- <dig> h- <dig>  thus, strain lu10- <dig> possesses all the plant-growth-promoting characters, namely siderophores, iaa production, p solubilization, and nitrogenase activity.

discussion
our results demonstrate that the strain b. cepacia lu10- <dig> is an endophyte that can colonize the roots, stems, and leaves of mulberry seedlings rapidly and efficiently following the application of the bacteria by soil drenching. using gfp-labelled cells b. cepacia was found mainly in intercellular spaces of roots and stems, although they were also present within the epidermis, xylem vessels, and cells of the root hair, cortex, and pith. the colonization pattern was similar to that observed for many other endophytes  <cit> .

several mechanisms of disease suppression have been proposed, such as antibiotic metabolites production, siderophore production, and induction of systemic resistance  <cit> . it was reported that induced systemic resistance  might be one of the most important operating mechanisms of disease suppression  <cit> . many investigators have shown that isr is triggered by bacterial inoculation  <cit> . our results demonstrate that lu10- <dig> is an effective biocontrol agent against anthracnose of mulberry in a greenhouse although the extent of disease suppression varied with the length of the gap between application of the bacterial strain and inoculation with the pathogen . although strain lu10- <dig> could multiply and spread inside mulberry plants, we could not re-isolate lu10- <dig> from the leaves inoculated with c. dematium pathogen within  <dig> days of applying the bacteria either to the soil or uninoculatd leaves. this rules out any physical contact between the bacteria and the pathogen on the leaf surfaces, and yet the plants showed resistance to c. dematium at sites distant from the site of application of lu10- <dig>  we therefore attribute the disease suppression to resistance induced in the mulberry plant, which might be one of the mechanisms underlying biocontrol by lu10- <dig>  it was reported that bacterial populations must be of certain minimum size before they can induce such resistance  <cit> . therefore, some time must elapse between the application of the bacteria and inoculation with c. dematium for the bacteria to build up their population to the level necessary for colonizing plant tissues--which is why the extent of disease suppression varied with the length of the interval between the application of lu10- <dig> and inoculation with the pathogen. though the disease was not suppressed when the treatment and the inoculation were simultaneous but the sites of the two interventions were separated in space, it was suppressed significantly when the bacteria were applied to the same site, that is to the inoculated leaves. furthermore, we found that lu10- <dig> produces a metabolite that is released into the medium and inhibits mycelial growth  and conidial germination  in c. dematium. our results show that lu10- <dig> can produce bacterial siderophores, which are low-molecular-weight compounds that can inhibit the growth of plant pathogens. these siderophores might also be partly responsible for the biocontrolling properties of lu10- <dig>  thus lu10- <dig> apparently has multiple mechanisms of antifungal activity that protect mulberry under greenhouse conditions against leaf infection by c. dematium. genetic and biochemical studies will be conducted to determine the exact mechanisms that are essential to the biocontrol potential of strain lu10- <dig> 

many endophytic bacteria are known to produce auxins and exhibit p solubilization and nitrogenase activity, all of which enhance root development and improve the uptake of minerals and water  <cit> . however, bacteria exhibiting all the plant-growth-promoting features simultaneously are rare  <cit> . our findings add to this list a novel bacterium, lu10- <dig>  which has all the plant-growth-promoting characters, namely nitrogenase activity, iaa production, and p solubilization. plant-growth-promoting effects of lu10- <dig> might be due to iaa alone or the combined effects of p solubilization and nitrogenase activity, and future work will elucidate the exact mechanisms.

CONCLUSIONS
strain lu10- <dig> inhibited the development of anthracnose significantly. the strain can survive in both sterile and non-sterile soils for more than  <dig> days, produces auxins, exhibits p solubilization and nitrogenase activity, and has significant growth-promoting effects on mulberry seedlings. it can also multiply and spread inside mulberry seedlings rapidly and efficiently. taken together, strain lu10- <dig> has great potential as a biocontrol and growth-promoting agent.
