BACKGROUND
early  <dig>  a search for genes deleted in wilms' tumors, a pediatric solid tumor of the kidney led to the identification of the x-linked gene wtx   <cit> . using large-scale interactome mapping a second independent study demonstrated that wtx induces degradation of β-catenin via the proteasome system, thus identifying this gene as an important modulator of this crucial signaling pathway  <cit> . wtx/amer <dig> also physically interacts with apc  <cit> , a tumor suppressor gene involved in colorectal cancer  <cit> . in addition, on the cellular level wtx localizes to subnuclear domains that have been identified as paraspeckles  <cit> . recent analysis suggests that wtx may also play an important function during normal development: expression analysis demonstrated a dynamic expression pattern throughout embryogenesis  <cit>  and mutations have been identified in patients suffering from a range of developmental defects including osteopathia striata congenita with cranial sclerosis  and cardiac anomalies  <cit> . to better characterize the functional and structural properties of the wtx/amer <dig> gene it is essential to understand its molecular evolution and its phylogenetic history. duplications are common events during evolution and are one of the main driving forces for the emergence of new genes that can lead to the appearance of new gene families. the aim of the present study was to identify potential new members of the "wtx/amer" family, characterize their phylogenetic relationships and analyze their evolutionary history.

RESULTS
wtx/amer <dig> is the founding member of a novel vertebrate gene family
using the wtx/amer <dig> sequence as a bait for protein-protein comparisons in the human genome, fam123a  and fam123c  were identified as two genes that share several domains of significant sequence identity with wtx/amer <dig> and are located in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. amer <dig> and amer <dig> were also present in mouse mapping to chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. alignment of the mouse and human sequences highlighted the presence of six highly conserved blocks that we named b <dig> to b <dig> . the mouse and human amer proteins are encoded by a single exon although 5' untranslated sequences map to additional exons . in the case of wtx/amer <dig> additional splicing within the coding exon can result in alternative protein variants  <cit> . these spliced forms are detected after transient transfection of mouse wtx/amer <dig> in human cells, but not in mouse embryos from e <dig>  to e <dig>  dpc . sequencing of rt-pcr products from the embryonic samples indicated the presence of a shorter transcript than expected for amer <dig> . this result showed that splicing leads to an in-frame deletion of amino acids within the n-terminal region of amer <dig>  the existence of two variants for human amer <dig> had already been reported by grohmann et al.   <cit>  after in silico analysis. alignment of the spliced form of amer <dig> with the full-length transcript revealed a splice site donor with an ag-gt core sequence which is universally found at the exon/intron junction. sequence analysis localized this splice site donor just after the conserved domain b <dig> . by contrast, amer <dig> does not seem to undergo splicing, as we detected only one long transcript by rt-pcr both in mouse embryos and in transiently transfected cells with mouse amer <dig> .

to further investigate the evolutionary origin and phylogenetic distribution of the amer genes, we extended the in silico searches to other available genomic databases. we could identify orthologs of wtx/amer <dig>  amer <dig> and amer <dig> in primates , and all other studied mammals , including the most basal therian groups, xenarthra , marsupials  and monotremes . the three amer genes were also present in other tetrapod species such as birds , amphibians  and in actinopterygians  . we were unable to find any ortholog in cyclostome genomes such as the lamprey , but this is probably due to the fact that this genome has not yet been completely sequenced and assembled.

in stark contrast to their presence in apparently all vertebrates, no amer genes could be identified in the genomes of model invertebrates including flies or nematodes and other protostomes such as mollusks  and annelids . a similar situation already exists for other wnt signaling components such as the dkk family, which was believed to be vertebrate specific  <cit> . more recently, however, dkk genes have been described in the diploblastic hydra and sea anemone  <cit> . it has, therefore, been postulated that gene families are missing in model protostomes due to the fast evolutionary rates and rampant gene loss in drosophila and caenorhabditis elegans genomes  <cit> . to test whether a similar situation may exist for the amer gene family, we searched for amer orthologs in a wide range of metazoans, from the most basal  to the vertebrates' closest relatives. no hits in any of the analyzed genomes could be detected, not even in non-vertebrate chordates  and other non-vertebrate deuterostomes such as sea urchin  despite the low occurrence of gene loss in some of these species  <cit> . although we cannot rule out the possibility that amer-related genes are present in some of these species, but have diverged beyond recognition, our data strongly suggest that this gene family is vertebrate specific. while the six conserved blocks of sequences found in the human and mouse proteins are present in all the vertebrate orthologs , prosite analysis did not identify protein domains of known function . taken together, our data support the common origin of the three genes, which seemed to have arisen at the time of the origin of vertebrates.

phylogenetic relationship of wtx/amer <dig>  amer <dig> and amer3
to analyze in more detail the evolutionary history of the amer gene family we constructed a phylogenetic tree using the protein sequences identified above. phylogenetic analysis revealed that wtx/amer <dig>  amer <dig> and amer <dig> form three independent groups in each class of vertebrate species from fish to placental mammals . among the three genes wtx/amer <dig> and amer <dig> show a higher extent of sequence similarity . in all the species analyzed, the three genes are located on three different chromosomes suggesting that they evolved by genome duplications rather than tandem duplication events . if wtx/amer <dig>  amer <dig> and amer <dig> genes arise from a common ancestor, one should expect to find them in the vicinity of a common gene family. schematic representation of chromosomal locations for each gene is given in figure sm <dig> . the following genes were found in syntenic position with wtx/amer <dig>  amer <dig> and amer3: mtmr6/ <dig>  and arhgef4/ <dig>  4/9). in drosophila the ortholog for both mtmr <dig> and mtmr <dig>  is the gene  located on chromosome 2r. similarly, the ortholog for arhgef <dig> and arhgef <dig> is rhogef <dig>  a gene located on the drosophila chromosome 3l . at those two putative syntenic regions, we could not find any gene with significant level of sequence conservation to the amer gene family. more precisely none of the six conserved sequence blocks could be found in the genes neighbouring cg <dig> or rhogef <dig>  the fact that arhgef4/ <dig> is a neighbour of both wtx/amer <dig> and amer <dig> and that mtmr6/ <dig> neighbours both wtx/amer <dig> and amer <dig> suggested that the ancestors of these two gene families  were located close to each other early in the vertebrate lineage . this suggests a loss of paralogs after or between the two rounds of complete duplication in vertebrates . based on our analysis, we propose an evolutionary model  that is consistent with the two rounds of complete genome duplication in vertebrates  <cit> . in our model, a putative amer <dig> gene may have been lost after duplication and the presence of a "protoamer" at the basis of the vertebrate lineage would represent the ancestral vertebrate condition preceding the gene split into amer1/ <dig> and amer3/ <dig> . surprisingly, the ortholog distribution of wtx/amer <dig>  amer <dig> and amer <dig> in teleosts does not reflect the additional round of genome duplication that occurred in these species . a secondary loss of the duplicated genes can explain the present situation. analysis of the degree of identical residues between human and zebrafish amer gene products shows that it is relatively conserved . in addition, residues showing a high degree of similarity after multiple alignment of amer proteins from human and zebrafish correspond to the specific conserved domains found in amer proteins .

the radial phylogenetic tree  confirmed the subdivision of the three genes into three different groups.

divergent and conserved molecular functions of wtx/amer <dig> genes
as noted by françois jacob in  <dig>  it is at the molecular level that the tinkering aspect of evolution becomes most apparent  <cit> . even when gene families evolve by duplication, their members can undergo significant changes leading to structural and functional diversity. according to this view, the protoamer gene may have encoded a short protein to which the highly divergent c-terminal half of wtx/amer <dig> and amer <dig> might have been added at a later time point during evolution . this c-terminal part of the wtx/amer <dig> protein is of importance as it has been demonstrated to be involved in the degradation of the wnt signaling pathway effector β-catenin  <cit> . according to the primary structure we expect that amer <dig> and amer <dig> are unable to inhibit β-catenin activity. indeed, amer <dig> failed to counteract β-catenin activation in an in vitro reporter system . while wtx/amer <dig> and amer <dig> are both long proteins, their c terminal half lacks significant sequence identity and our phylogenetic analysis places the two genes into two different groups . functional experiments revealed that amer <dig> was also unable to decrease β-catenin dependent gene activation . taken together these data indicate that wtx/amer <dig> might have been co-opted to interact with β-catenin. while addition of the β-catenin interaction domain to wtx/amer <dig> seems to be the most likely scenario, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of a functional loss of this capability in amer <dig> and  <dig> proteins. in contrast, the function of the amer gene family as proteins that recruit apc to the membrane might be conserved, as both wtx/amer <dig> and amer <dig> possess sequences that allow the molecular interaction with apc . the apc interacting domains overlap four of the six conserved blocks  indicating that amer <dig> might also be involved in apc shuttling. if so, it seems that the ability to recruit apc is one of the ancestral functions of the amer family.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we reported the first phylogenetic analysis of the amer gene family and identify amer <dig> as a novel family member. the common ancestry of the three amer genes is supported by the presence of six conserved sequence blocks in all the orthologs, as well as the syntenic conservation with ntmr and arhgef paralogs in their three genomic loci. the absence of any sequence similarity to amer genes in invertebrate genomes and the presence of three amer paralogs in all studied vertebrate species strongly support the hypothesis that these genes are novel inventions that originated early in vertebrate evolution. additional functional studies using animal models misexpressing amer <dig> and amer <dig> or knock out alleles will be required to determine their exact function in embryogenesis. given the importance of wtx/amer <dig> in normal development and its involvement in human pathologies, it is tempting to speculate that mutations in amer <dig> and amer <dig> may also underlie developmental disorders.
