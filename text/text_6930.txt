BACKGROUND
hdgf  is the eponymous member of a growth factor family comprising hdgf and five additional proteins . hdgf was initially purified from serum-free supernatant of human hepatoma cell line huh- <dig>  <cit> . hdgf contains a characteristic modular structure composed of an n-terminal region  conserved among all members of the family and an acidic c-terminus unique to hdgf  <cit> . two nuclear localization signals, one in the hath region, and in the carboxy-terminal domain are prerequisites for the mainly nuclear localization of hdgf  <cit> . however, in some cells hdgf appears also in the cytoplasm  <cit> .

in several studies it has been shown that recombinant hdgf is implicated in cellular proliferation  <cit> . furthermore hdgf has been suggested to be neurotrophic and involved in organ development and regeneration  <cit> . however, no obvious biochemical or morphological phenotype could be detected in a hdgf-deficient mouse model  <cit> .

over the last decade, hdgf research focuses on its possible role in tumour induction and/or tumour progression and metastasis. hdgf is highly expressed in a wide variety of carcinomas and has been shown to be a valid prognostic marker  <cit> . beside its proliferative activity hdgf was reported to have angiogenic as well as antiapoptotic activity thereby making it an interesting candidate for tumour therapy  <cit> . the latter activity may be explained by a modulation of the expression of members of the bcl- <dig> family of pro- and antiapoptotic factors in human cancer cells by hdgf  <cit> . besides this, the molecular mechanisms of the antiapoptotic activity of hdgf are poorly understood.

here we describe the identification of proteins copurifying with hdgfstrep-tag on strep-tactin®-macroprep beads. by transfecting a dna construct coding for an hdgfstrep-tag fusion protein, we were able to purify hdgfstrep-tag containing protein complexes and identified  <dig> possible interaction partners of hdgf. beside ribosomal proteins, heterogenous ribonucleoproteins, and members of the cellular dna-repair machinery we identified nucleolin as a possible hdgf interacting protein by mass spectrometry and western blot. similar to hdgf nucleolin was reported to play an important role in tumour biology by regulating proliferative, apoptotic and angiogenic signalling pathways  <cit> . we therefore focused in our study on a possible interaction of hdgf and nucleolin. the presented experiments reveal that the interaction of hdgfstrep-tag and nucleolin is rna-dependent and show that hdgf is able to regulate the cellular distribution of nucleolin. overexpression of bcl- <dig> mrna enhances complex formation of nucleolin and hdgfstrep-tag in hela cells. regarding our results we therefore propose a rna-containing nucleolin-hdgf protein complex possibly regulating the cellular amount of bcl- <dig> mrna.

protein purification
lysates from transfection experiments were either affinity-purified with strep-tactin®-macroprep beads or spin columns . briefly columns were equilibrated in  <dig> μl buffer w  and centrifuged at  <dig> × g for  <dig> min. lysates were applied onto the columns and centrifuged two times at  <dig> × g for one minute. columns were washed four times with  <dig> μl buffer w and centrifuged each time at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> s. proteins were eluted with buffer e  and centrifuged for one minute at  <dig> × g followed by thirty seconds at  <dig>  × g. beads were equilibrated with buffer l and incubated with lysates for  <dig> h at 4°c. beads were washed four times with  <dig> μl buffer w and centrifuged for  <dig> min at  <dig> × g. supernatants were removed and beads were either directly digested with trypsin for mass spectrometry analysis or eluted with  <dig> μl buffer e. eluate fractions were analyzed by western blot and mass spectrometry.

for affinity purification of endogenous hdgf rabbit anti-human hdgf antibody was immobilized on nhs activated beads .  <dig> μl of these beads were filled into a spin column  and washed with  <dig> column volumes of pbs. hela whole cellular extracts were prepared as described above and loaded onto the hdgf affinity column. after washing the column with pbs containing  <dig> mm nacl bound protein was eluted with  <dig> mm citric acid ph  <dig>  a column containing rabbit igg was used as a control. no elution of hdgf or nucleolin was detected from this column.

western blot analysis
proteins were separated on a 10% sds-page gel and electrotransferred to a protran nitrocellulose transfer membrane . free binding sites were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in tris–hcl buffered saline  ph  <dig>  for one hour at room temperature. primary antibodies used were monoclonal anti nucleolin antibody , peroxidase coupled strep-tactin®  and polyclonal anti hdgf antibody. membranes were washed three times for  <dig> minutes with tbs supplemented with  <dig> % tween <dig> . for detection peroxidase coupled goat anti rabbit or goat anti mouse antibodies were used. membranes were washed again three times with tbs/t and once with tbs before western blotting chemiluminescent substrate  was applied.

immunocytochemical staining
briefly, cells were transfected with either mouse hdgf wild type or mouse hdgf-nls <dig> mutant with turbofect reagent  following the instructions of the manufacturer. after  <dig> hours, hela cells were fixed by incubation in ice-cold methanol for  <dig> min on ice. coverslips were washed three times with tbs and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin  in tbs for  <dig> min at room temperature. antigens were detected by incubation with polyclonal rabbit anti hdgf antibody  and monoclonal mouse anti nucleolin antibody  in 1% bsa in tbs for one hour at room temperature. bound antibodies were visualized using cy3-conjugated goat anti rabbit  or alexa 488-conjugated goat anti mouse  antibodies . cells were counterstained with 4′6-diamidine-2-phenylidole-dihydrochloride . coverslips were mounted in mowiol and analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy on an axiovert  <dig> m instrument .

rnase digestion
cell extracts were incubated with rnase a  prior to protein purification. briefly, cell lysates were treated with  <dig> μg/ml rnase a at 4°c over night under mild rotation. protein purification was carried out as described previously.

rt-pcr
cells were transfected as described and  <dig> h after transfection rna was isolated using  <dig> ml trizol™  according to manufacturer’s instruction. five hundred nanogram rna was used for cdna synthesis using oligo dt-primer and the reverdaid kit  as recommend by the supplier. one microliter of cdna was used for pcr. primer sequences for 5′utr of bcl- <dig> were 5′gcaagcttgtaagctctggagagtgctgaagat3′  and 5′gcgaattcccttcccagaggaaaagc3′  and for gapdh were 5′gatgacatcaagaaggtggtga3′ and 5′ctgtagccaaattcgttgtcat3′. the pcr program consisted of initial denaturation at 95°c for  <dig> s, annealing at 54°c for  <dig> s and extension at 72°c for  <dig> min for  <dig> cycles in case of the bcl- <dig> 5′utr and  <dig> cycles for gapdh. the specificity of all pcr reactions was tested by parallel reactions using water instead of cdna . the pcr products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.

mass spectrometry
for analysis peptides generated by tryptic digest of strep-tactin®-macroprep beads were separated using an ultimate  <dig> rslcnano system . samples were loaded onto a trapping column  by the loading pump of the system operating at  <dig> μl/min, and  <dig> % trifluoroacetic acid in water was used as mobile phase. after  <dig> min, valve was switched and the sample was eluted onto the analytical separation column , using a flow rate of  <dig> nl/min. the mobile phases used were h2o/ <dig> % formic acid  for buffer a and 80% acn/ <dig> % formic acid  for buffer b. peptides were resolved by gradient elution using a gradient of 2 − 55% buffer b over  <dig> min, followed by a gradient of 50 − 90% buffer b over  <dig> min. after  <dig> min at 90% b the gradient returned to 5% buffer b preparing for the next run. column effluent was monitored using a  <dig> nl uv flow cell .

RESULTS
affinity purification and identification of components of hdgf containing protein complexes
to learn more about how hdgf might exert its biological effects we decided to identify interaction partners of the protein after overexpression in hek <dig> cells by taking advantage of the stringent purification scheme of the strep-tag/strep-tactin® system  <cit> . protein lysates from hek cells expressing hdgfstrep-tag or as a control gfp-streptag fusion proteins were applied to a strep-tactin® macroprep matrix. after washing, beads were incubated with trypsin and released tryptic peptides were analysed by esi-ms/ms . to control reproducibility this experiment was performed four times each for hdgf and gfp, starting with the transfection of the dna constructs coding for the strep-tagged proteins into hek <dig> cells. results were searched against swissprot human protein database using mascot search engine and all proteins identified by two or more peptides and with a sum psm  of higher then nine were included into a result list. this list contained  <dig> and  <dig> interacting proteins for hdgfstrep-tag and gfpstrep-tag lysates, respectively, of which  <dig> were identified in both samples . subtraction of the overlapping proteins resulted in a list of  <dig> proteins only found in the hdgfstrep-tag interactome. go molecular function analysis of these proteins shows that many of them have binding functions , including protein binding  and nucleic acid binding, especially rna binding  . besides hdgf, the highest score and the highest number of psms were obtained for nucleolin , a protein known to be involved in proliferation, apoptosis and neoangiogenesis similar to what was reported for hdgf. due to this surprising overlap with hdgf function we focused on nucleolin in our further analysis.


first of all we confirmed copurification of nucleolin with hdgf by an independent sds-page gel based identification strategy. therefore, hdgfstrep-tag copurifying proteins where not digested directly on the beads but were eluted with biotin, separated by sds-page, and the most abundant coeluting proteins were stained by coomassie brilliant blue . besides a strong signal corresponding to hdgfstrep-tag additional proteins of higher molecular weight could be detected specifically copurifying in the presence of hdgfstrep-tag but not in the eluate prepared from cells transfected with a control construct. peptides released from gel pieces by tryptic digest were analysed by nanolc-esi-iontrap mass spectrometry. mascot database searches of the peptide sequences revealed highly significant protein identifications for nucleolin, ku <dig>  parp <dig> and dna-pkcs. in detail, thirteen different peptides for nucleolin resulting in a sequence coverage of 22%, fourteen peptides for ku <dig> , fifteen peptides for parp <dig>  and twenty peptides for dna-pkcs  were identified . to confirm our mass spectrometry results we performed western blotting on the hdgfstrep-tag eluate fractions using a specific nucleolin antibody. results in figure 2b demonstrate the specific coelution of nucleolin from the hdgfstrep-tag resin using transfected hek <dig> cells. in addition copurification of ku <dig> could also be proofed by western blotting .


hdgf is part of a rna-dependent nucleolin containing complex and influences cellular distribution of nucleolin
influence of nucleolin on cellular mrna content in hela cells has been studied extensively in a recent study  <cit> . therefore, extracts from untransfected hela cells were passed over a human hdgf antibody column to investigate whether the nucleolin-hdgf complex formation can also be observed with endogenous hdgf. unspecifically bound proteins were removed by washing with high salt containing buffer. proteins bound to the column via the hdgf antibody were eluted with  <dig> mm citric acid ph  <dig>  eluted proteins were separated by sds-page, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and subjected to western blot analysis. immunoblotting with a monoclonal nucleolin antibody confirmed specific binding of nucleolin to the hdgf antibody column . thus, the interaction of hdgf with nucleolin is not a specific feature of the hdgfstrep-tag fusion proteins but occurs also with unfused endogeneous protein. interestingly, for both strategies described here only the full length nucleolin showed efficient copurification together with hdgf whereas smaller forms detected by the specific antibody against nucleolin did not purified together with hdgfstrep-tag as well as endogenous hdgf. this observation points to the specificity of the purification protocol.

hdgf is predominantly a nuclear protein with low expression in the cytoplasm. recent data, however, suggest a cytoplasmic localization in certain tumours. nucleolin is primarily a nucleolar protein with the ability to shuttle between nucleus, cytoplasm and cell surface. to investigate whether cellular localization of nucleolin can be manipulated by hdgf, hela cells were transfected with an expression vector encoding for a murine hdgf cdna with a mutation in the nls <dig>  sequence which has been shown before to cause a predominant cytoplasmic localization of hdgf . cells transfected with the hdgf-nls <dig> showed strong nucleolin expression in the cytoplasm  whereas in cells with wild type hdgf nucleolin was retained mainly in the nucleus . to quantify this effect, we counted cells  positive for hdgf staining and analysed these cells with regard to their localisation of nucleolin. we distinguished nuclear and cytoplasmic localization. 67% of cells transfected with hdgf-nls <dig> showed translocation of nucleolin from nucleus to cytoplasm. in comparison, only 7% of wild type hdgf transfected cells showed this effect . therefore, redistribution of hdgf into the cytoplasm leads to substantial cytoplasmic nucleolin localization. this observation is strong evidence of functionally relevant in vivo interaction of hdgf and nucleolin.


hdgf was shown to exhibit binding activity upon ribosomal rnas  <cit> . in accordance to this we observed copurification of rna from hela as well as hek  <dig> cells during purification of hdgfstrep-tag. together with  <dig> μg of protein an average of  <dig> μg rna could be eluted from hdgfstrep-tag macroprep beads. in comparison unspecific rna binding of beads not loaded with protein was less than  <dig> μg . nucleolin was reported to interact with other proteins in a rna-dependent manner  <cit> . therefore we investigated whether hdgfstrep-tag-nucleolin interaction depends on the presence of rna. therefore, cell lysates of hela cells expressing hdgfstrep-tag fusion proteins were incubated with  <dig> μg/ml rnase a prior to the affinity purification of hdgfstrep-tag containing protein complexes. this treatment completely abolished the interaction of hdgfstrep-tag and nucleolin as detected by western blotting against nucleolin .

hdgf-nucleolin complex formation is mediated by bcl- <dig> full length mrna
to investigate whether hdgf-nucleolin copurification occurs because of hdgfs general rna binding activity or whether it depends on the presence of certain mrnas we screened the literature for functional overlaps in hdgf and nucleolin activity. the latter is known to regulate cellular bcl- <dig> protein amount by binding to and stabilizing its mrna. interestingly, hdgf was also reported to manipulate cellular bcl- <dig> content  <cit> .

to examine whether bcl- <dig> mrna might be involved in the observed complex formation we took advantage of paclitaxel, a substance which was reported to destabilize bcl- <dig> mrna  <cit> . if the hdgfstrep-tag-nucleolin complex depends on the presence of bcl- <dig> mrna paclitaxel treatment should reduce the amount of nucleolin copurified with hdgfstrep-tag fusion protein. indeed, addition of  <dig> μm paclitaxel to the cell culture medium of hela cells led to a significant decrease of nucleolin in the hdgfstrep-tag eluate fractions .


to proof the role of bcl- <dig> mrna in hdgfstrep-tag-nucleolin complex formation hela cells were transfected with a vector encoding different parts of bcl- <dig> mrna and the hdgfstrep-tag fusion protein . all constructs led to a similar degree of bcl- <dig> protein expression in transfected cells . after purification of the hdgfstrep-tag fusion protein via affinity chromatography nucleolin was detected in the eluate fractions. figure 4c shows that expression of a full length version of bcl- <dig> mrna  leads to an increased amount of nucleolin in the eluate fractions. this indicates that bcl-2- mrna causes an enhanced interaction between hdgfstrep-tag fusion proteins and nucleolin. nucleolin was reported to bind to the utr’s of bcl- <dig> mrna  <cit> . if the interaction of hdgfstrep-tag and nucleolin depends on nucleolin binding to bcl- <dig> mrna one would expect that the coding sequence of bcl- <dig> alone will not increase the amount of nucleolin copurifying with hdgfstrep-tag. surprisingly, transfection of the corresponding construct  not only failed increasing nucleolin copurification but inhibited the complex formation of hdgf and nucleolin completely . to localize bcl-2-mrna regions responsible for hdgfstrep-tag nucleolin interaction in more detail we also transfected several vectors expressing different sections of the bcl-2-mrna . in contrast to the cds alone constructs containing one or both utrs were able to restore the activity of the bcl- <dig> mrna to increase hdgfstrep-tag nucleolin interaction. even addition of the are <dig> that was reported to be the minimal motive for nucleolin binding to the bcl- <dig> mrna was sufficient to restore the observed activity of bcl- <dig> mrna.

to examine whether the utrs are not only necessary but sufficient for this effect, we exchanged the cds of bcl- <dig> in its full length construct  for the cds of the secreted alkaline phosphatase . rt-pcr demonstrates the increased amount of the bcl- <dig> utrs after transfection of constructs coding for the bcl- <dig> full length mrna as well as the bcl-2/seap chimera in contrast to the cds alone . interestingly, only the full length bcl- <dig> construct was able to increase copurification of nucleolin demonstrating an important role of the bcl- <dig> cds in hdgfstrep-tag nucleolin complex formation in addition to its utrs .


discussion
in multiple studies it has been shown that elevated levels of hdgf in different types of tumours correlate with metastatic potential, increased malignancy and thus, a unfavourable prognosis for patients  <cit> . approaches to explain these observations showed that hdgf modulates a wide variety of cellular functions ranging from proliferation to angiogenesis and cellular survival  <cit> . regarding the latter, hdgf has been reported to exert antiapoptotic activity via the regulation of members of the bcl- <dig> protein family. depending on different cell types upregulation of bcl- <dig>  or downregulation of bad  was reported. however, whether hdgf achieves these modulations via transcriptional control mechanisms like reported for the set and mynd domain containing  <dig> gene  <cit>  or on a posttranscriptional level is completely unknown.

in this report, we investigated the hdgf interactom. most of the proteins identified here have functions in rna biogenesis and processing. furthermore, we identified members of dna repair pathways xrcc6/ku <dig>  xrcc5/ku <dig>  parp <dig> and dna-pkcs among the most prominent hdgf interaction partners. parp- <dig> was shown before to form a complex with both dna-pkcs and ku70/ku <dig>  <cit> . this complex plays an important role in non-homologous end joining a special form of dna repair  <cit> . lepourcelet and coworkers reported the correlation of hdgf reexpression with mismatch repair proficient colon carcinoma in contrast to carcinomas deficient for this type of dna repair suggesting an involvement of hdgf in this kind of biological process  <cit> . furthermore, a more global approach on hdgf interactions also found different members of dna repair pathways as possible interaction partners of hdgf  <cit> . the biological relevance of this finding is subject of further investigation but the identification of all three proteins underlines the specificity of our approach.

besides the members of dna repair pathways nucleolin copurified with hdgf. multiple functions have been assigned to nucleolin a rna-binding phosphoprotein of the nucleolus. besides its function in ribosomal biogenesis nucleolin is associated with many processes dysfunctional in tumour cells  <cit> . these properties are in line with probable hdgf functions. most interestingly, nucleolin has been shown to be a key regulator of bcl- <dig> via binding and stabilizing its mrna  <cit> . therefore, to investigate possible biological relevance of our results we focused on the hdgf-nucleolin interaction. first of all using an antibody based affinity chromatography approach we demonstrated the existence of an hdgf-nucleolin containing complex also for endogenous hdgf. this is important because all other proteomic studies to date only reported interactions after overexpression of hdgf.

nucleolin is a protein with predominant localization in the nucleus but is also able to translocate to the cytoplasm similar to what was reported for hdgf. of interest, as shown in figure  <dig>  hdgf is able to regulate the cellular localisation of nucleolin in hela cells. this finding again underlines the in vivo relevance of the hdgf-nucleolin interaction. previous data suggest that the phosphorylation state of nucleolin is important for the efficiency of nucleolin shuttling  <cit> . whether phosphorylation/dephosphorylation signalling or other mechanisms are involved in hdgf-nucleolin shuttling has to be revealed in further studies.

nucleolin has rna binding activity and many interactions of nucleolin occur in the presence of rna. binding to ribosomal rnas has also been recently demonstrated for hdgf  <cit> . not surprisingly the observed copurification of nucleolin with hdgfstrep-tag is also dependent on rna. here we show that specifically bcl- <dig> mrna is able to mediate hdgf-nucleolin complex formation. regulation of bcl- <dig> on mrna as well as protein level has attracted increasing attention over the last years and is frequently an obstacle on cancer treatment  <cit> . bcl- <dig> mrna stabilization and regulation of translation efficiency is regulated by nucleolin via binding to au-rich elements  in the 3′untranslated region   <cit> . consistent with this we show that the presence of these regions is a prerequisite for the bcl- <dig> mrna induced hdgf-nucleolin complex formation.

formation of the hdgf-nucleolin complex depends on the presence of either the 3′ or 5′ utr in combination with the coding sequence, respectively. in contrast, the coding sequence alone or its replacement by an unrelated coding sequence does not propagate complex formation. this clearly shows that the combination of utrs and bcl- <dig> coding sequence is essential for hdgf-nucleolin interaction. hdgf has been shown to bind rna rather unspecifically  <cit> . a model compatible with the bcl- <dig> mrna dependent formation of the hdgf/nucleolin complex would be that hdgf binds the coding sequence rather unspecifically and that nucleolin is incorporated via regions of the  <dig> and 5′ utr.

besides its already known function as a transcriptional repressor the results described here point to a possible role of hdgf in rna transport, stability and/or translational control. furthermore nucleolin was shown to regulate transport of mrna as a member of ribonucleoprotein complexes  <cit>  and translation for example of p <dig> together with ribosomal protein l <dig>  <cit> . future approaches should therefore target possible roles of hdgf in rna transport and translational control.

it is also not known whether there is a direct interaction between hdgf and nucleolin. this finding would be interesting regarding a possible interaction of hdgf and nucleolin at the cell surface. nucleolin was reported to function as cell surface receptor for molecules like midkine or pleiotrophin  <cit> . interestingly, as reported for hdgf nucleolin can also bind to certain glycosaminoglycans  <cit>  and heparin binding motifs of potential ligands can function as binding motifs for nucleolin  <cit> . similar to ribonucleic acids gags have been demonstrated to support a wide variety of protein-protein interactions. nucleolin therefore could possibly serve as the up to now unknown cell surface receptor for hdgf in a gag-dependent way explaining at least some of its proliferative as well angiogenic properties as an extracellular factor during tumour formation.

CONCLUSIONS
hdgf has been reported to be overexpressed in a wide variety of tumours and its expression correlates with an unfavourable prognosis for cancer patients. but how hdgf exactly contributes to tumourigenesis is not known up to now. interestingly, in this study we demonstrate that nucleolin, a protein known to be involved in a set of processes relevant during tumourigenesis, can participate in these complexes and that the mrna of bcl- <dig>  a known regulator of apoptosis, contributes to their composition. the results presented here give evidence that beside its activity as a transcriptional repressor intracellular hdgf might exerts some of its cellular functions by posttranscriptional regulation of rnas as a member of nucleoprotein complexes. these findings therefore contribute to the understanding of a possible role of hdgf during tumour onset and progression and are the base for a new set of biochemical and cell biological experiments addressing hdgf biology.
