BACKGROUND
ornamental kale  is a popular ornamental plant cultivated worldwide owing to its variegated, colorful leaves  <cit>  and strong resistance to cold. the leaves of ornamental kale are diverse and colorful: the edges are emerald green, dark-green, gray-green, or yellow-green, and the center can be white, yellow, pink, red, purple or other complex color varieties. the leaf pattern of ornamental kale is classified as foliage leaves, round leaves, cracked leaves, wave leaves and other types. furthermore, purple-leaf ornamental kale, which is mainly due to various anthocyanin components  <cit> , is reported to possess strong antioxidant capacity and thus potential benefits to human health  <cit> .

some leaf color genes have been mapped in brassica crops. for example, the red leaf color trait is reportedly controlled by the single dominant gene re in ornamental kale, which was mapped to c <dig> between ssr markers c9z <dig> and c9z <dig>  with genetic distances of  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm, respectively  <cit> . in brassica juncea, the purple leaf gene  was mapped between srap markers me7em <dig> and me2em <dig>  with genetic distances of  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm, respectively  <cit> . a purple leaf dominant gene  in brassica rapa was assigned to a locus between indel markers bvrcpi <dig> and bvrcpi <dig>  with a genetic interval of  <dig>  cm  <cit> . an incomplete dominant gene  for the purple leaf trait in brassica napus has been mapped, and the possible candidate gene is predicted to encode adenosine 5’-phosphosulfate reductase  <cit> . zhu et al. found the pink leaf color trait in ornamental kale to be controlled by a single semi-dominant gene mapped to c <dig> between ssr marker ni2c <dig> and co-dominant scar marker boac <dig>  with genetic distances of  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm, respectively  <cit> .

with the development of molecular biology and the release of the b. oleracea draft genome  <cit> , uncovering the genetic basis of important traits has become a focus of theoretical and applied studies in this species. to date, many genes/qtls have been mapped in brassica oleracea using indel markers, including the fusarium wilt resistance gene foc <dig>  <cit> , the petal color gene cpc- <dig>  <cit> , the yellow-green gene ygl- <dig>  <cit> , and qtls associated with heading traits  <cit> , head-splitting resistance  <cit> , diamondback  moth resistance  <cit> , and resistance to diseases such as sclerotinia sclerotiorum  <cit> , black rot  <cit> , and clubroot  <cit> .

in this study, kale inbred line w <dig>  was crossed to inbred line p <dig>  to construct f <dig> and backcross  populations, which were used for genetic analysis and fine mapping of the gene for the purple leaf trait. genes located within the fine-mapping region were analyzed. these findings will lay a foundation for the cloning and validation of bopr and will facilitate elucidation of the molecular mechanism for purple leaf formation in b. oleracea l. var. acephala.

the female kale inbred line w <dig>  was crossed with male kale inbred line p <dig>  to generate the f <dig> population. the f <dig> population was obtained via self-pollination of f <dig> plants; bc1p <dig> and bc1p <dig> populations were created by backcrossing of f1 × w <dig> and f1 × p <dig>  respectively. all materials were from cabbage and broccoli research group, institute of vegetables and flowers , chinese academy of agricultural sciences .fig.  <dig> phenotypes of the parental lines. a w <dig>  b p1835




genetic analysis and indel marker development
leaf color was identified visually. the segregation ratios of the f <dig> and bc <dig> populations were analyzed using a chi-square test with sas software.

the ‘02–12’ reference genome of cabbage was downloaded from brad   <cit> ; the to <dig> sequence was obtained from the genome sequence   <cit> . the sequencing-by-synthesis method was used to re-sequence the parents at approximately 10× coverage over the entire genome  <cit> . this work was completed at beijing genomics institute  . for preliminary mapping, the re-sequencing data for both parents was mapped to the ‘02–12’ reference genome of b. oleracea  to detect 3-5 bp insertion-deletion mutations between the parents. indel primers were then designed. due to the possible assembly error of the 02– <dig> reference genome, new primers in the preliminary mapping region were designed based on the to <dig> reference genome. primers were designed to have amplicon lengths of 100–200 bp, gc contents of 40–50% and tm values of 52–62 °c.

dna extraction and bulked segregant analysis 
genomic dna was extracted from fresh leaves using a modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide  protocol  <cit> . the concentration of dna was estimated using a spectrophotometer  and diluted to 40–50 ng/μl.

ten purple-leaf f <dig> individuals and ten white-leaf f <dig> individuals were selected to construct two pools using the bsa method  <cit> . polymorphic indel markers between the parents were used to screen these pools, and polymorphic markers between the pools were used to examine recombination with all white-leaf individuals in the f <dig> and bc1p <dig> populations.

the 20 μl pcr reaction mixture contained 4 μl dna template , 2 μl 10× pcr buffer ,  <dig>  μl dntps ,  <dig>  μl forward primer ,  <dig>  μl reverse primer ,  <dig>  μl taq dna polymerase  and  <dig>  μl ddh2o. reactions were performed in a thermal cycler as follows: 94 °c for 5 min; 35 cycles of 94 °c for 30 s, 55 °c for 30 s and 72 °c for 45 s; 72 °c for 10 min. amplicons were separated by 8% page at 160 v for  <dig>  h, followed by silver staining.

data analysis
for each marker, individuals with the w <dig> allele were categorized as ‘a’, and individuals with the p <dig> allele were categorized as ‘b’; those with the f <dig> allele were categorized as ‘h’. the kosambi mapping function was used to calculate genetic distances between markers  <cit> , and the genetic map was constructed using mapdraw  <cit> .

to identify probable genes associated with purple leaves, genes located within the candidate interval were analyzed based on annotations from the b. oleracea reference genome ‘to1000’.

analysis of the candidate gene
to amplify the candidate gene bo9g <dig>  primers were designed in dnaman  <dig>  using the sequence of bo9g <dig>  pcr amplification was performed using the q <dig> ultra high fidelity dna polymerase. the pcr amplification conditions followed the manufacturer’s specifications. the annealing temperature was determined using the neb tm calculator , and the elongation step was based on a rate of 30 s/kb. the candidate gene sequence was determined by sanger sequencing of the pcr amplicons.

RESULTS
genetic analysis of leaf color of w <dig> with p1835
sixteen f <dig> individuals generated by crossing w <dig> with p <dig> exhibited purple leaves, indicating that the purple leaf color trait is dominant over the white-leaf trait. in the f <dig> population,  <dig> of  <dig> individuals displayed white leaves and  <dig> purple leaves. the chi-square test confirmed this segregation ratio to be 3: <dig>  in the bc1p <dig> population,  <dig> of  <dig> individuals showed purple leaves and  <dig> white leaves, with the chi-square test confirming the segregation ratio to be 1: <dig>  the leaves of all  <dig> individuals in the bc1p <dig> population were purple . these results indicated that the purple leaf trait is controlled by a single dominant gene, which we termed bopr.table  <dig> the chi-square  goodness-of-fit test ratios of leaf color segregation in bc and f <dig> populations

preliminary mapping of bopr
illumina paired-end sequencing generated reads of  <dig>  gb for kale inbred line w <dig> and  <dig>  gb for line p <dig>  a total of  <dig> pairs of indel marker primers were designed by comparing the whole-genome re-sequencing data with the sequence of the ‘02–12’ reference genome.

these indel marker primers were used to screen for polymorphisms between the parents. ultimately,  <dig> of the  <dig> pairs of primers revealed polymorphisms, with a polymorphic rate of  <dig> %. the polymorphisms were further screened in two the bulks of the f <dig> population, and only boid <dig>  boid <dig> and boid <dig> exhibited polymorphisms between the two bulks. the three markers were preliminarily located on chromosome c <dig> according to the marker location in the reference genome.

subsequently,  <dig> new additional indel markers near the three polymorphic primers were designed,  <dig> of which showed polymorphisms. only co-dominant markers with clear and stable amplification were chosen for further analysis in the f <dig> and bc1p <dig> populations. a genetic map comprising  <dig> indel markers  was constructed using mapdraw  <cit>  . indel markers m <dig> and boid <dig> were found to be closest to bopr, flanking the gene at genetic distances of  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm, respectively. based on marker locations in the reference genome ‘02–12’, bopr is located on chromosome c <dig>  the interval between the two markers is 280 kb .table  <dig> the indel primer sequences used in this study

fine mapping of the purple leaf gene
the 280 kb interval spans two scaffolds , and no polymorphic marker between the parents was found in this narrow interval. moreover, the genetic distance for this 280 kb interval was calculated to be  <dig>  cm,  <dig> times higher than the usual level . thus, another reference genome, ‘to1000’  <cit> , was used to determine the accuracy of this interval. blast alignment analysis showed the physical distance between markers m <dig>  and boid <dig>  to be approximately  <dig>  mb in the ‘to1000’ reference genome, indicating possible assembly errors in the reference genome ‘02–12’ or ‘to1000’. to determine whether this  <dig>  mb interval is linked to the bopr gene,  <dig> pairs of indel marker primers were designed based on the ‘to1000’ reference genome. polymorphisms between the two bulks were found for  <dig> of the  <dig> pairs, and these were used to analyze the bc1p <dig> and f <dig> populations. a genetic map comprising  <dig> indel markers  was constructed using mapdraw . indel markers brid <dig> and brid <dig> were found to be the closest to bopr, flanking the gene at genetic distances of  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm, respectively. based on marker locations in the reference genome ‘to1000’, the interval between brid <dig> and brid <dig> is  <dig>  kb .

prediction and analysis of the candidate gene
based on the ‘to1000’ reference genome  , seven genes were identified in the  <dig>  kb region . according to domain annotations from interpro and blastx  analyses, four of these seven genes have not been annotated . the other three genes are as follows: bo9g <dig>  encoding the largest proteasomal subunit; bo9g <dig>  encoding inositol tetra-pentaphosphate 2-kinase; bo9g <dig>  encoding dihydroflavonol 4-reductase , which catalyzes conversion of dihydroquercetin to leucocyanidin in anthocyanin biosynthesis  <cit> . thus, we tentatively designated bo9g <dig> as the candidate gene controlling the purple leaf color in ornamental kale.table  <dig> annotation of b. oleracea genes in the candidate region

discussion
mapping of the purple leaf gene
purple-leaf traits have been studied in several species, such as rice  <cit> , tetraploid wheat  <cit> , brassica rapa  <cit> , and carrot  <cit> . some genes related to anthocyanins, which might be responsible for purple leaf color, have been reported in brassica, including brpur in b. rapa  <cit> , bnaa.pl <dig> in b. napus  <cit> , and the re and pi genes in b. oleracea  <cit> .

ren et al.  <cit>  reported that markers c9z <dig>  and c9z <dig>  are tightly linked to re, which controls the red-leaf phenotype in kale  <cit> . the red-leaf phenotype is similar with the purple phenotype of the parents used in the present study. based on reference genome ‘to1000’, our results show that c9z <dig> is located between indel markers brid <dig>  and brid <dig>  and that c9z <dig> is located between indel markers boid <dig>  and boid <dig> . this indicates that the mapping interval in ren et al.  <cit>  is larger than ours. furthermore, the distance between the re gene and the closest markers are  <dig>  cm for c9z <dig> and  <dig>  cm for c9z <dig>  <cit>  but  <dig>  cm for boid <dig> and  <dig>  cm for brid <dig> in our mapping population, which may be caused by different mapping populations. in our study, however, the bopr gene was successfully fine mapped to a  <dig> -kb interval based in the ‘to1000’ reference genome.

for the mapping population, f <dig> and bc <dig> populations are usually constructed for mapping important agronomic traits. in this study, for markers far away from the candidate gene, the recombination rate of the f <dig> population was larger than that of the bc1p <dig> population; however, the opposite case was true for markers close to the candidate region . the closest flanking markers brid <dig> and brid <dig> were all screened from the bc1p <dig> population, with no recombinants in the f <dig> population. furthermore, the rate of recessive individuals in the bc1p <dig> populations was 1/ <dig>  which was twice that of the f <dig> population. therefore, we used the large bc1p <dig> population to fine map the candidate gene.

possible assembly errors in cabbage reference genome ‘02–12’
with the development of technology, large amounts of data are produced by genome sequencing, though genome assemblies based on these data are often woefully incomplete. although the nipponbare reference sequence  exhibits the best quality among crop genomes, it still contains many assembly errors and gaps  <cit> . genome sequencing has been completed in three species of brassica: b.napus  <cit> , b. rapa  <cit>  and b. oleracea  <cit> . some assembly problems have been reported. for example, lee et al.  <cit>  revised the ‘02–12’ reference genome assembly when they mapped clubroot resistance qtls using genotyping-by-sequencing; new positions for  <dig> v-blocks and 10 s-blocks and several inversions of some alphabetically named blocks in reference genome ‘02–12’ and two mis-anchored sequence scaffolds in reference genome ‘to1000’ were identified. in addition, liu et al.  <cit>  found possible assembly errors in ‘02–12’ while mapping a yellow-green leaf mutant.

in this study, the recombination rate of markers m <dig> and boid <dig> in ‘02–12’  <cit>   was found to be almost  <dig> times higher than the usual level in the cabbage genome  in preliminary mapping. in ‘to1000’, the primary mapping interval was found to be  <dig>  mb . based on the ‘to1000’ genome, the bopr gene was fine mapped to a  <dig>  kb interval, but according to primary mapping, this  <dig>  kb is not located in the 280 kb region but is on an unanchored scaffold  of ‘02–12’. thus, the mapping results suggested possible assembly error and the potential location of the unanchored scaffold000035_p <dig> in the 02– <dig> reference genome. however, this scaffold is only  <dig>  mb. more unanchored scaffolds could be detected within this interval in the future if pacbio, a third-generation sequencing platform, is applied to improve the reference genome of ‘02–12’. these results will contribute to the improvement of the cabbage genome and provide guidance for map-based cloning of other genes in this region.

the dfr gene in anthocyanin biosynthetic pathways
the biosynthetic pathways of anthocyanins and related genes have been well characterized, and dfr is a key enzyme in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . in characterizing dfr genes, ahmed et al. found that these genes are associated with cold and freezing stresses in b. rapa  <cit> . guo et al. identified  <dig> anthocyanin biosynthetic genes, locating the dfr gene on chromosome a <dig>  named brdfr , in b. rapa  <cit> .

in our study, bo9g <dig> was found to be homologous to arabidopsis thaliana at5g <dig>  which encodes dfr. dfrs utilizing the three primary dihydroflavonol substrates have been characterized. expression of dfr clones together with plant-specific 4-coumaroyl: coa ligase, chalcone synthase, chalcone isomerase, and flavanone 3-hydroxylase in e. coli resulted in the synthesis of various levels of pelargonidin and could be used for engineering of other bioactive flavonoids, such as flavan-3-ols  <cit> . the purple-leaf trait of ornamental kale is largely attributed to various anthocyanin components  <cit> , and sequence alignment showed that the function of bo9g <dig> in the white-leaf line w <dig> is disrupted by two indels. furthermore, we designed a co-dominant marker based on sequence differences between w <dig> and p <dig>  and this marker co-segregated with the phenotype of all recessive individuals in the f <dig> and bc <dig> populations. thus, we suggest that bo9g <dig> is the most likely candidate gene for the purple-leaf trait. however, further work involving transformation is needed to verify whether the function of this gene is responsible for purple leaves in kale.

CONCLUSIONS
inheritance of purple leaves in kale was found to be controlled by a single dominant gene, bopr, and this gene was mapped to a  <dig>  kb interval  on chromosome c <dig>  indel markers brid <dig> and brid <dig> are closest to bopr, flanking the gene at genetic distances of  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm. in the fine-mapping region, only bo9g <dig> showed high homology to at5g <dig> , which was identified as a candidate gene for bopr. this study lays a foundation for the cloning of the gene bopr as well as further function analyses.
