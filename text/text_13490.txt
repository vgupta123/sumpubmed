BACKGROUND
phylogenetic relationships among basal angiosperms have been debated for over  <dig> years since darwin  <cit>  identified the origin and rapid diversification of flowering plants as an "abominable mystery". the difficulty of resolving these relationships is likely due to the rapid radiation of angiosperms. during the past decade there has been considerable interest in estimating phylogenetic relationships based on single or multiple genes to resolve the basal radiation of flowering plants  <cit> . recently, completely sequenced plastid genomes have been used to estimate relationships among basal angiosperms  <cit>  and comprehensive analyses of these data concur with earlier studies resolving either amborella or amborella plus the nymphaelales as the basal-most clade, sister to all other angiosperms  <cit> ,  <cit> . although the whole plastid genome approach has enhanced our understanding of basal angiosperm relationships, issues of taxon sampling and methods of phylogenetic analysis have generated considerable controversy regarding the efficacy of this approach  <cit> . one of the major limitations of this approach is the paucity of plastid genome sequences from early diverging lineages, especially the magnoliids, which are currently represented only by calycanthus  <cit> .

with four orders,  <dig> families, and approximately  <dig>  species, the magnoliids comprise the largest clade of early diverging angiosperms  <cit> . recent single and multigene trees have provided only weak to moderate support for the monophyly of this clade  <cit> . one notable exception is the phylogenetic estimate of qiu et al.  <cit>  based on eight plastid, mitochondrial, and nuclear genes and  <dig> taxa representing all of the major lineages of gymnosperms and angiosperms. this eight-gene tree provides the first strong support for the monophyly of the four orders of magnoliids, and for sister group relationships between the canellales/piperales and laurales/magnoliales.

one of the most important remaining phylogenetic issues regarding angiosperms is the relationship of magnoliids to the other major clades, including the monocots and eudicots. all three possible relationships among these major angiosperm clades have been generated based on single and multiple gene trees, but none receives strong support in any of these studies . the three-gene phylogenetic tree of soltis et al.  <cit>  placed the magnoliids and monocots in a clade that was sister to the eudicots. support for the monophyly of this group, which was referred to as eumagnoliids, was weak with a jackknife value of only 56%. this same topology was generated in bayesian analyses using the plastid gene matk, with a parsimony bootstrap value of 78% and a bayesian posterior probability of  <dig>   <cit> . two multi-gene molecular phylogenetic studies identified the magnoliids sister to the eudicots. the 11-gene mp trees in zanis et al.  <cit>  provided only weak support  for the sister group relationship between magnoliids and eudicots, and in the 9-gene analyses of qiu et al.  <cit>  support for this same relationship increased to 78% in ml trees. finally, a third possible resolution of relationships among magnoliids, monocots, and eudicots was recovered in two other studies based on phytochrome genes  <cit>  and  <dig> plastid genes  <cit> . these studies suggested that magnoliids were sister to a clade that included monocots and eudicots, however, support for this relationship had only weak or moderate bootstrap support . thus, despite intensive efforts during the past  <dig> years relationships among magnoliids, monocots, and eudicots remain problematic.

in this paper, we report on the complete sequences of three magnoliid plastid genomes . we characterize the organization of two of these genomes, including the most comprehensive comparisons of gc content among completely sequenced plastid genomes. furthermore, the results of phylogenetic analyses of dna sequences of  <dig> genes for  <dig> taxa, including  <dig> angiosperms and two gymnosperm outgroups provide new evidence for resolving relationships among angiosperms with an emphasis on relative positions of magnoliids, monocots and eudicots. these results have implications for our understanding of floral evolution in the angiosperms .

RESULTS
size, gene content, order and organization of the drimys and piper plastid genomes
we have sequenced the plastid genomes of three genera of magnoliids, drimys, liriodendron, and piper. in this paper, we only characterize the genome of two of these, drimys and piper, and we use  <dig> protein-coding genes from all three for the phylogenetic analyses. the genome sequence for liriodendron will be described in a future paper on the utility of  <dig> sequencing  <cit>  for plastid genomes .

the sizes of the drimys and piper plastid genomes are nearly identical at  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp, respectively , and within a kb of the liriodendron plastid genome size . the genomes include a pair of inverted repeats of  <dig>  bp  and  <dig>  bp , separated by a small single copy region of  <dig>  bp  and  <dig>  bp  and a large single copy region  <dig>  bp  and  <dig>  bp . the drimys ir has expanded on the ira side to duplicate trnh-gug. this expansion has not increased the overall size of the ir in drimys because two of the genes in the ir of drimys are shorter than they are in piper .

the drimys and piper plastid genomes contain  <dig> different genes, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  of these are duplicated in the ir, giving a total of 130– <dig> genes . there are only two differences in gene content between these two magnoliid genomes; one is due to the duplication of trnh-gug in drimys and the second is that ycf <dig> appears to be a pseudogene in piper, since it has an internal stop codon that results in a truncated gene that is only  <dig> bp long . eighteen genes contain introns,  <dig> of which contain one intron and three  with two introns . there are  <dig> distinct trnas, and  <dig> and  <dig> of these are duplicated in the ir of drimys and piper, respectively. the genomes consist of  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  protein-coding genes,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  rna genes, and  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  non-coding regions . gene order is identical in the magnoliid plastid genomes sequenced from drimys, piper, liriodendron , and calycanthus  <cit> , and those of most angiosperms, including tobacco.

gc content
the overall gc content of the piper and drimys plastid genomes is similar,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. these values are within the range of 34–39% gc content but slightly higher than that of the average for  <dig> plastid genomes representing all currently available angiosperms and one gymnosperm pinus . in some cases, overall gc content correlates with phylogenetic position: early diverging lineages  tend to have a higher gc content and legumes and non-grass monocots have lower values . gc content is not uniformly distributed across the plastid genome . in general, gc content is higher in coding regions than in non-coding regions  . this pattern is also supported by the observation that gc content of protein-coding genes is higher than the overall gc content for the complete genomes . a t test indicated that this pattern is statistically significant at p <  <dig> . gc content also varies by codon position with the 1st codon > 2nd codon > 3rd codon . gc content was also compared by partitioning protein-coding genes into three functional groups . this comparison demonstrates that the percent of gc for all three codon positions is highest in photosynthesis genes, followed by genetic system genes, and lowest in nadh genes. statistical tests using anova demonstrated that differences in gc content by codon positions and functional groups are significant at p <  <dig> . gc content is similar among all genomes  even in taxa that have different gene orders . the ir regions have higher gc content and the ssc has the lowest. the much higher gc content in the ir is due to the presence of rrna genes . the lower gc content in the ssc is due to the presence of eight of the  <dig> nadh genes, which have a lower gc content than photosynthetic and genetic system genes . this genome wide pattern of gc content is maintained even when one copy of the ir is lost .

phylogenetic analyses
our phylogenetic data set included  <dig> protein-coding genes for  <dig> taxa , including  <dig> angiosperms and two gymnosperm outgroups . the data set comprised  <dig>  nucleotide positions but when the gaps were excluded there were  <dig>  characters.

maximum parsimony  analyses resulted in a single, fully resolved tree with a length of  <dig> , a consistency index of  <dig>  , and a retention index of  <dig>  . bootstrap analyses indicated that  <dig> of the  <dig> nodes were supported by values ≥ 95% and  <dig> of these had a bootstrap value of 100%. of the remaining  <dig> nodes, five had bootstrap values between 80–95%. maximum likelihood  analysis resulted in a single tree with – lnl =  <dig>  . ml bootstrap values also were also high, with values of ≥ 95% for  <dig> of the  <dig> nodes and 100% for  <dig> these nodes. the ml and mp trees had similar topologies. both trees indicate that amborella alone forms the earliest diverging angiosperm, however, support for this placement is much higher in the mp tree  than the ml tree . the next most basal clade includes the nymphaeales  and support for this relationship is 100% in both mp and ml trees. recent phylogenetic trees based on complete plastid genome sequences  <cit>  have highlighted the difficulty of resolving the relative position of amborella and the nymphaeales. two alternative hypotheses that have received the most support are: amborella as the earliest diverging lineage of angiosperms, or amborella and the nymphaeales forming a clade sister to all remaining extant angiosperms. in a previous study using  <dig> plastid genes  the first hypothesis was strongly supported  in parsimony trees and the second hypothesis received only moderate support  in ml trees. both mp and ml trees support the basal position of amborella alone in our expanded taxon sampling. we performed a sh test  <cit>  to determine if the amborella/nymphaeales basal hypothesis is a reasonable alternative to the ml and mp trees that support the amborella basal topology. the ml score for the alternative topology was -ln l =  <dig>  versus  <dig>  for the best ml tree. the difference in the -ln l was  <dig>  with a p =  <dig> . thus, the amborella/nymphaeales basal hypothesis could not be rejected by the sh test, indicating that identification of the most basal angiosperm lineage remains unresolved even with the addition of three magnoliid genomes.

relationships among most other major angiosperm clades are congruent in the mp and ml trees. monophyly of the magnoliids is strongly supported with  <dig>  or 100%  bootstrap values. within magnoliids there are two well-supported clades, one including the canellales/piperales with  <dig>  or  <dig> % bootstrap support, and a second including the laurales/magnoliales with  <dig>  or  <dig> % bootstrap support. the magnoliid clade forms a sister group to a large clade that includes the monocots and eudicots. support for the sister relationship of magnoliids to the remaining angiosperms is moderate  or strong .

support for the monophyly of monocots and eudicots is strong with 100% bootstrap values, and relationships among the monocots is identical in both analyses. the ranunculales occupy the earliest diverging lineage among eudicots, and they are sister to two major, strongly supported clades, the rosids and caryophyllales/asterids. there is strong support for the sister group relationship between the caryophyllales and asterids . both mp and ml trees provide strong support for the placement of vitis as the earliest diverging lineage within the rosids. the only remaining incongruence between mp and ml trees is found within the rosids. in both analyses, eurosids i are not monophyletic, although support for relationships among the five representatives of this clade to the eurosid ii and myrtales clades is not strong.

discussion
genome organization and evolution of gc content
the organization of the drimys and piper genomes with two copies of an ir separating the ssc and lsc regions is identical to most sequenced angiosperm plastid genomes . the sizes of the genome at  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp, respectively are similar to the each other and liriodendron, but larger than the only other sequenced magnoliid genome . most of this size difference is due to the larger size of the ir in drimys  and piper  relative to calycanthus , although some is also due to the larger lsc region . expansion and contraction of the ir is a common phenomenon in land plant plastid genomes  <cit>  with the ir ranging in size from  <dig>  bp in the moss physcomitrella  <cit>  to  <dig>  bp in the highly rearranged angiosperm genome of pelargonium  <cit> . among angiosperms the ir generally ranges in size between 20– <dig> kb, and the magnoliid genomes except for calycanthus are at the high end of that range.

gene order of the magnoliid plastid genomes is identical to tobacco and many other unrearranged angiosperm plastid genomes. there are a few differences in gene content and these can be explained by two phenomena. the first concerns differences in the annotation of two genes in these genomes. two putative genes  in calycanthus were not annotated in drimys and piper because several recent studies indicated that they are not functional plastid genes. the sequence of ycf <dig> has been shown to be highly variable among angiosperms, with conserved motifs at the 5' and 3' ends and an intervening sequence that makes it a pseudogene  <cit> . an examination of ycf <dig> transcripts in spinach indicated that is not a functional protein-coding gene  <cit> . more recent sequence comparisons of ycf <dig> in other plastid genomes also supported the conclusion that this putative gene is not functional  <cit> . the acrs gene was identified by goremykin et al.  <cit>  in calycanthus based on its very high sequence identity with the mitochondrial acr-toxin sensitivity  gene of citrus jambhiri  <cit> . this conserved sequence has been identified  in a number of plastid genomes, however, in cases where it has been critically examined the presence of internal stop codons indicates that this is a pseudogene. the second explanation for gene content differences among the three magnoliid genomes is caused by the expansion of the ir in piper, which results in the duplication of trnh. small expansions of the ir boundary are common in plastid genomes  <cit>  resulting in duplications of genes at the ir/sc boundaries. the duplication of trnh in piper is shared with nuphar, a member of the nymphaeales . this expansion of the ir to duplicate trnh has clearly happened independently in piper and nuphar since none of the other basal angiosperms or magnoliids have this duplication.

examination of gc content in  <dig> seed plant plastid genomes reveals several clear patterns. gc content for the complete genomes ranges between 34–39% , confirming previous observations that plastid genomes are in general at rich  <cit> . the uneven distribution of gc content over the plastid genome is also very evident, and there are several explanations for this pattern. first, there is a clear bias for the coding regions to have a significantly higher gc content than non-coding regions , which again confirms previous observations based on comparisons of many fewer genomes  <cit> . second, there is an uneven distribution of gc content by regions of the genome with the highest gc content in the ir and the lowest in the ssc . the higher gc content in the ir can be attributed to the presence of the four rrna genes in this region, which have the highest gc content of any coding regions . this higher gc content in the ir region is maintained even when one copy of the ir is lost as in medicago and pinus . the lower gc content in the ssc region is due to the presence of  <dig> of the  <dig> nadh genes, which have the lowest gc content of any of the classes of genes compared . third, gc content varies by functional groups of genes. among protein genes, gc content is highest for photosynthetic genes, lowest for nadh genes, with genetic system genes having intermediate values. this same pattern was observed by shimada and sugiura  <cit>  in comparisons of the first three sequenced land plant plastid genomes.

differences in gc content were also observed by codon position in protein-coding genes . for each of the three classes of genes  the third position in the codon has a significant at bias. this pattern has been observed previously  <cit> , and it has been attributed to codon bias. previous studies have demonstrated that there is a strong a+t bias in the third codon position for plastid genes  <cit> . this is in contrast to a gc bias in codon usage for nuclear genes in plants  <cit> . several studies have examined codon usage of plastid genes to attempt to determine if these biases can be attributed to nucleotide compositional bias, selection for translational efficiency, or a balance among mutational biases, natural selection, and genetic drift  <cit> . all of these studies have been limited to examining a single or few genes, and they have been constrained by the limited sampling of complete genome sequences for taking variation in gc content into account. our comparisons of gc content variation for a wide diversity of angiosperm lineages provide a rich source of information for future investigations of the relationship between gc content and codon usage bias.

phylogenetic implications
the debate concerning the identity of the most basal angiosperm lineage continues even though numerous molecular phylogenetic studies of angiosperms have been conducted over the past  <dig> years  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> . several issues have confounded the resolution of relationships among basal angiosperms, including long branch attraction associated with sparse taxon density and poor taxon sampling, and conflict among trees obtained using different phylogenetic methodologies  <cit> . most recent studies agree that amborella and the nymphaeales represent the earliest diverging angiosperm lineages  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> . the most recent multi-gene phylogenetic reconstructions based on nine gene sequences from the plastid, mitochondrial, and nuclear genomes  <cit>  generate trees supporting each of these two hypotheses depending on the method of phylogenetic analysis and the genes included. trees generated from plastid genes supported the amborella basal hypothesis, whereas mitochondrial genes supported the amborella + nymphaeales hypothesis. furthermore, mp analyses tended to support the amborella basal hypothesis and ml analyses supported amborella + nymphaeales. a similar set of relationships was also observed in recent phylogenetic studies using sequences of  <dig> genes from completely sequenced plastid genomes  <cit> . in these studies, mp trees placed amborella alone as the basal most angiosperm with strong support and ml trees placed amborella + nymphaeales at the base with moderate support. these differences were attributed to rapid diversification and the lack of extant lineages that could be used to cut the length of branches leading to amborella and the most recent common ancestor of lineages within the nymphaeales.

our phylogenetic analyses include three additional magnoliids from three different orders. both mp and ml trees  support amborella alone as the earliest diverging lineage of angiosperms. support for this relationship is very strong in mp trees  and weak  in ml trees. however, a sh test that constrained amborella + nymphaeales in a basal position indicated that the two hypotheses of basal angiosperm relationships are not significantly different. thus, although both mp and ml analyses including the three additional magnoliid taxa support amborella as the basal-most branch in the angiosperm phylogeny, sampling of more taxa and genes, and further investigations of model specification in phylogenetic analyses are needed before this issue is fully resolved .

several earlier molecular phylogenetic studies based on one or a few genes  <cit>  did not support the monophyly of magnoliids. furthermore, morphological studies of angiosperms failed to detect any synapomorphies for this group. the circumscription, monophyly, and relationships of magnoliids has only recently been established based on phylogenetic analyses of multiple genes  <cit> . these earlier multigene trees provided only weak to moderate support for the monophyly of magnoliids and the sister group relationships of the canellales/piperales and laurales/magnoliales. a recent study using eight plastid, mitochondrial, and nuclear genes  <cit>  provided the first strong support for both the monophyly and relationships among the four orders of magnoliids. our phylogenetic trees based on  <dig> plastid protein-coding genes also provide strong support for the monophyly of magnoliids and the sister relationship between the canellales/piperales and laurales/magnoliales.

one of the most controversial remaining issues regarding relationships among angiosperms concerns the resolution of relationships among the magnoliids, monocots and eudicots. previous phylogenetic studies have supported three different hypotheses of relationships among these lineages:  ),  ), and  ). the first hypothesis was supported in phylogenetic analyses based on phytochrome genes  <cit>  and  <dig> plastid genes  <cit>  but bootstrap support for a sister relationship of monocots and eudicots was only 67%. several studies supported the second hypothesis  <cit> , however, bootstrap support was again weak ranging from  <dig> – 78%. the three-gene phylogenetic tree of soltis et al.  <cit>  supported the third hypothesis with only 56% jackknife support. this relationship was also recovered in a matk gene tree with a parsimony bootstrap value of 78% and a posterior probability of  <dig>   <cit> . both mp and ml trees based on  <dig> plastid-encoded protein genes support hypothesis  <dig> . branch support for this hypothesis is moderate  or strong . congruence of the results from both mp and ml analyses is notable because our previous phylogenetic analyses using whole plastid genomes that included only one member of the magnoliid clade  were incongruent. in these earlier studies, mp trees supported hypothesis  <dig> , whereas ml trees supported hypothesis  <dig> . these differences provide yet another example of the importance of expanded taxon sampling in phylogenetic studies using sequences from whole plastid genomes  <cit> . the addition of other angiosperm lineages, especially members of the chloranthales, certatophyllaceae, and illiciales may be critical for providing additional resolution of relationships among the major clades.

CONCLUSIONS
the genome sequences of three additional magnoliids have a very similar size and organization to the ancestral angiosperm plastid genome. comparisons of  <dig> seed plant plastid genomes confirm that gc content is unevenly distributed across the genome by location, codon position, and functional group. phylogenetic analyses for  <dig> protein-coding genes using both maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods for  <dig> seed plants provide moderate or strong support for the placement of amborella sister to all other angiosperms. furthermore, there is strong support for the monophyly of magnoliids and for the recognition of two major clades, the canellales/piperales and the laurales/magnoliales. finally, phylogenetic analyses provide the strongest support so far that magnoliids are sister to a large clade that includes both monocots and eudicots.
