BACKGROUND
the cultivated european vitis vinifera l. produces high quality grapes but is prone to several diseases. however, other species of the genus vitis, originally from eastern asia and north and central america, have been described as partially or totally resistant to several pathogens  <cit> . among these, the oomycete plasmopara viticola  berl. and de toni is a major problem for grapevine production around the world. in susceptible cultivars, this biotrophic pathogen rapidly invades infected leaves causing yellowish oily spots on the upper leaf surface and massive sporulations on the underside  <cit> . invasion also occurs in resistant genotypes, but proliferation is swiftly blocked by a combination of constitutive and post-infection resistance mechanisms  <cit> .

indeed, resistant vitis species may benefit from a higher level of constitutive resistance to p. viticola  <cit>  and display post-infection resistant mechanisms which trigger the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, antimicrobial phenolic compounds, as well as pathogenesis-related proteins and peroxidases  <cit> . these events lead to morphological changes in the cell, including cell-wall thickening, necrosis and in some cases localized hypersensitive response   <cit> .

stilbenoids represent the major antimicrobial phenolic compounds in grapevine  <cit> , and they may be constitutively expressed in the lignified organs  <cit>  and in the grapes  <cit> , or they may be elicited by fungal infection  <cit> , abiotic stresses or elicitors  <cit> .

the complex genetic basis of the resistance mechanisms of grapevine against p. viticola have been extensively investigated both by quantitative trait loci  analysis of segregating populations and by genome-wide expression studies comparing resistant and susceptible species. qtl studies have identified a few major resistance loci  <cit>  which are particularly rich in resistance gene analogs . transcriptomic analyses of compatible and incompatible interactions in grapevine  <cit>  emphasized the complexity of plant response and highlighted modulation of a large fraction of the entire transcriptome in both cases, although this occurs earlier and with greater intensity in the incompatible interaction.

in the present work we investigated the variability in resistance to p. viticola of the merzling  × teroldego  cross by assaying the stilbenoid profile of the entire population and the transcriptomic differences between resistant and susceptible individuals following p. viticola infection. this study is part of a wider survey of the mechanisms of resistance to p. viticola in the m × t cross, which included isolation and structural characterization of all viniferins  <cit>  and validation of a novel method of analysis by hplc-dad-ms for quantification of them in infected grapevine leaves  <cit> .

RESULTS
segregation of the p. viticola-resistant phenotype and stilbenoid content in the progeny population
a continuous variation in sensitivity to p. viticola, taken as the percentage area of sporulation  on the lower leaf surface, was found in the m × t population in all the infection experiments performed in the three different years . the two tails of the distribution were populated by individuals displaying total resistance on one side and by completely susceptible individuals on the other side. the former were characterized by small necrotic hr spots and absence of sporulation, whereas the latter exhibited diffuse chlorosis, yellowish oily spots and high sporulation .

comparison of the distributions for the three years highlighted a general conservation in the range of variation in the observed phenotype, and differences in the frequencies of the phenotypic classes. this phenotype appears to be dependent on environmental factors. in particular, in  <dig> and  <dig> the square root transformed % sp values  of the progeny had a bimodal distribution, while in  <dig> the central classes were more populated giving the distribution a normal trend.

assessment of sensitivity to downy mildew using the oiv <dig> descriptor  <cit> , which takes into account all the plant symptoms instead of just the area of sporulation, found individuals to be distributed in nine classes ranging from total resistance to total susceptibility .

the parents in all three years, one confirmed to be partially resistant  and the other susceptible , showed a certain degree of variability regardless of the severity of the symptoms. interestingly, the range of sensitivity to p. viticola identified in the segregating population was greater than that delimited by the parents, suggesting transgressive segregation of the resistance trait.

an improved version  <cit>  of a previous method  <cit>  was used to measure stilbenoid accumulation in the infected leaves of the  <dig> individuals in a pooled sample of the second and third leaves of the shoot. following analysis of the total stilbenoid content at  <dig> days post infection , individuals of the population were classified into three distinct groups . the high producers  had the highest total stilbenoid content with an average of  <dig>  μg/g fresh weight  and a range of  <dig>  μg/g fw to  <dig>  μg/g fw). the second group, low producers, was the largest  with an average total stilbenoid content of  <dig>  μg/g fw . the remaining  <dig> individuals were considered non-stilbenoid producers, concentrations being below the quantification limit.

at  <dig> dpi, we were able to identify  <dig> monomeric stilbenes and  <dig> stilbenoid viniferins in the high producer group, including dimers, trimers and tetramers of resveratrol. some of them, such as trans-resveratrol, trans-piceid, trans-pterostilbene, -e-ε-viniferin, α-viniferin, e-miyabenol c and pallidol have already been found in grapevine and have in some cases been linked to the plant's response to fungal attack  <cit> . in addition, we were able to identify and quantify other viniferins  as yet undiscovered in grapevine and which may contribute to p. viticola resistance. these compounds have been isolated and structurally characterized by mattivi et al.  <cit> . the relative quantities of the different stilbenoids varied considerably, isohopeaphenol being the most abundant  and z- and e-ω-viniferin the least . their distribution within the high stilbenoid producers was also highly variable, suggesting that stereospecific oxidation reactions led to different patterns of viniferins in the infected leaves of different genotypes .

it is also evident from figure  <dig> that there is a negative correlation between the content of the different stilbenoids and the percentage of sporulation observed following infection. with very few exceptions, the high producers were also the individuals with the least severe sporulation symptoms. this does not hold true in the case of the monomeric stilbenes trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid, which were also found in the individuals with high sporulation and were the only stilbenes detected in the low producers .

gene expression analysis of resistant and susceptible genotypes
phenotypic and metabolic profiling of the progeny population showed a positive correlation between the offsprings' resistance to p. viticola and the stilbenoid content of their leaves. to further investigate the plants' resistance response to p. viticola, we took advantage of one transgressive genotype  showing almost total resistance and a high content of stilbenoids. the f <dig> 21/ <dig> genotype and its resistant parent merzling were subjected to cdna-aflp analysis at different times following infection. the expression profile of the p. viticola-responsive genes was then validated by a targeted microarray analysis, which also allowed us to compare the expression response of the f <dig> 21/ <dig> genotype versus two susceptible ones .

cdna-aflp analysis
a cdna-aflp analysis was performed to study the transcriptional changes occurring during resistance response to p. viticola in the almost totally resistant offspring 21/ <dig> and in the partially resistant parent merzling.

the expression of approximately  <dig>  transcript-derived fragments  was monitored using  <dig> different bstyi+1/msei+ <dig> primer combinations  for selective amplification. we were able to visualize  <dig> to  <dig> fragments, 50- <dig> bp in size, for each pc. four hundred tdfs showed a modulated expression profile upon infection by comparing the intensity of the bands in treated samples  with those in controls . interestingly,  <dig>  of the  <dig> tdfs were modulated only in the f <dig> 21/ <dig> genotype and not in the parent merzling. moreover, the kinetics of the modulation of the  <dig> transcripts differed. two major gene expression patterns were predominant in both genotypes: a large group of early modulated genes which appear to be switched on within  <dig> hpi  and a group of late activated genes which were modulated from  <dig> hpi . the fraction of induced tdfs was generally much larger than the repressed ones in both groups; this tendency was more evident for the late genes of the resistant offspring .

the differentially-expressed fragments were excised from the gel and re-amplified by pcr using the appropriate selective pcs . the pcr products yielded  <dig> good quality unique sequences . of the  <dig> tdfs,  <dig> were modulated in f <dig> 21/ <dig> and  <dig> in merzling. the remaining sequences were not unique and could not be attributed unambiguously, probably because of two or more co-migrating fragments.

of the  <dig> sequences,  <dig> matched with a database and were functionally annotated . the remaining  <dig> sequences did not match any significant database nor the known phytophthora spp. sequences derived from the phytophthora genome sequence  <cit> . automatic annotation of the  <dig> transcripts was performed using the gene ontology  classification  <cit>  and this was then further curated manually. tdfs were assigned to  <dig> go functional categories, with distinctions made between early- and late-modulated transcripts and between the two genotypes, as depicted in figure  <dig> 

primary metabolism was the largest category in both genotypes, followed by signal transduction, transport, photosynthesis and response to stimulus. interestingly, genes of the defense response and secondary metabolism classes were more highly modulated in the resistant genotype, mostly occurring in the first  <dig> hpi. as expected, the lower number of late tdfs from  <dig> hpi onwards went hand in hand with a smaller number of functional categories. a high number of modulated transcripts of both genotypes were of unknown function.

microarray analysis
the transcripts identified by cdna aflp analysis were used to design a custom oligo-microarray for studying the response of the resistant f <dig> 21/ <dig> compared with the parent teroldego and the 22/ <dig> offspring, both susceptible to the fungus. in addition to the  <dig> tdfs, probes representing another  <dig> genes known to be involved in plant-pathogen interaction were also included. the arrays were hybridized with total rna extracted from leaves of the three genotypes collected at  <dig> hpmi ,  <dig> and  <dig> hpi  . these time points were chosen because they corresponded to the early and late phases of transcriptional modulation observed in the cdna-aflp experiments.

comparative analysis of the treated samples versus the control sample within each genotype highlighted  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> modulated genes in f <dig> 21/ <dig>  teroldego and f <dig> 22/ <dig>  respectively . of the  <dig> modulated genes in f <dig> 21/ <dig>   <dig> showed the same profile as in the cdna-aflp analysis, although the sampling times were only partially overlapping.

in particular,  <dig> of the  <dig> modulated genes identified in the resistant genotype were also up-regulated in the susceptible individuals. most of the genes in this subset belong to three categories: response to stimulus, primary metabolism and photosynthesis. a group of  <dig> genes were exclusively modulated in the resistant genotype. of these,  <dig> were up-regulated at  <dig> hpi,  <dig> were up-regulated at  <dig> hpi while the remaining  <dig> were down-regulated at one of the time points. some of these transcripts were assigned to the categories defense response, photosynthesis and primary metabolism, as were the common modulated genes, and the others were assigned to the main functional groups of secondary metabolism, signal transduction and transport. we also found a group of genes specifically modulated in the susceptible individuals,  <dig> of which were exclusively induced in teroldego and  <dig> in the offspring  both at  <dig> hpi and at  <dig> hpi.

the microarray data for  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts, whose relative expression varied from  <dig> -fold to  <dig> -fold, were validated by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction  analysis . they were selected because they were related to the resistance process and also because of a large variation in fold change between control and treated samples. as shown in additional file  <dig>  there was good agreement with the array data and in some cases the magnitude of change determined by rt-qpcr revealed greater differential expression, indicating that the microarray results underestimated actual changes in gene expression.

discussion
in contrast to vitis vinifera, a species indigenous to eurasia, american and asian wild grapevine species are generally resistant to plasmopara viticola, having co-evolved with this mildew which occurs in the same habitat. there is compelling evidence that there are diverse p. viticola-resistance mechanisms  <cit>  and that they may rely on recognition of general elicitors or specific elicitors encoded by avr genes, as demonstrated in other models  <cit> .

in this study we used a combination of metabolic and transcriptional analyses to investigate p. viticola resistance in grapevine in a population of offspring generated by crossing merzling  with v. vinifera teroldego. this population clearly segregates for p. viticola resistance. the degree of individual sensitivity to the oomycete showed a distribution typical of traits controlled by a few major qtls with dominant effects, in line with the literature  <cit> .

a frequently observed defense mechanism in grapevine is the accumulation of phytoalexins belonging to the stilbene family  <cit> . we measured the concentration of the monomeric stilbenes and all the oligomer stilbenoids in the leaves of the entire population six days post inoculation and found a large variation both in the type and the relative quantity  of the stilbenoids. different levels of resveratrol monomers and oligomers have previously been reported in healthy grapes  <cit> , but also in infected leaves where they have been linked to the genotype's susceptibility to p. viticola  <cit> . estimated stilbenoid concentrations in the inoculated leaves ranged from less than  <dig> μg g - <dig> fw to more than  <dig> μg g - <dig> fw , suggesting that at least some of them were present at concentrations toxic for the pathogen . results from activity assays using the isolated stilbenoids will allow us to draw final conclusions. further investigation which merits being carried out, is a detailed kinetic analysis of stilbenoid accumulation and spreading of the pathogen in the infected leaves in order to corroborate the correlations emerging from this study. we performed our analysis at  <dig> dpi as this interval was ideal for discriminating stilbenic phytoalexin production in the different genotypes, as highlighted in vrhovsek et al.  <cit> .

our data indirectly confirmed that trans-resveratrol and its glycosilated form trans-piceid are not per se very toxic against p. viticola, as previously demonstrated by direct assays  and by analysis of grapevine genotypes with varying degrees of resistance to the oomycete  <cit> . type of substitution and oligomerisation state appear to be of importance in determining the role of a stilbene as a phytoalexin  <cit> . the two resveratrol monomers were in fact found in most of the susceptible genotypes, while resveratrol oligomers accumulated almost exclusively in the resistant offspring. there were two kinds of exception: three genotypes with detectable levels of oligomers, but displaying an intermediate degree of sporulation , and a group of genotypes with no detectable or very low levels of oligomers, but still resistant to p. viticola. both groups of individuals represent highly interesting material for further analysis, in particular the latter group whose resistance could be ascribed to a different mechanism which does not involve the presence of viniferins.

interestingly, with respect to both resistance trait distribution and stilbene profiles, the population included transgressive members which express the characteristic under investigation to an extent beyond the range delimited by the parents. for this reason our transcriptional analysis included the f <dig> 21/ <dig> genotype.

several studies have demonstrated that v. vinifera undergoes strong transcriptional modulation upon p. viticola infection in order to prevent pathogen invasion  <cit> , but the response seems to be more variable in the case of incompatible reactions. very limited gene modulation has been reported in the interaction between v. aestivalis and erysiphae necator  <cit> , while more recently, study of the incompatible interaction between v. riparia and p. viticola revealed instead a pronounced transcriptional change  <cit> .

to investigate gene expression response in our pathosystem we carried out a comparative analysis on resistant and susceptible individuals using a combination of cdna-aflp and oligo-array techniques. the microarray experiments highlighted very different behaviors in the resistant and the susceptible genotypes upon infection. there was a much higher number of modulated transcripts in the 21/ <dig> offspring than in teroldego and the 22/ <dig> offspring. it should be noted that the design of the study does not allow us to extend this result to the fraction of genes which were not represented on the array.

half of the f <dig> 21/ <dig> modulated genes had the same profile observed in the cdna-aflp experiment and they were generally up-regulated . a difference was, however, seen in the timing of the modulation: gene induction was detected mainly after  <dig> hpi in the microarray experiment, whereas 53% of the genes were already induced at  <dig> hpi in the cdna-aflp study. this difference likely resides in the higher number of sampling times considered in the cdna-aflp study and in the fact that the microarray technique is less sensitive than the pcr-based cdna-aflp technique. a similar technical discrepancy was found in a recent study involving molecular analysis of resistance to leaf stripe in barley  <cit> .

of the  <dig> modulated genes in the resistant offspring only  <dig> were also induced in the susceptible individuals. this class includes genes encoding for proteins involved in transcription and translation activation, namely an elongation factor 1-alpha  and a pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein , and for a phase change-related protein  and a lipid transfer protein  activated in other plant-pathogen interactions  <cit> . their early up-regulation, within  <dig> hpi, suggests metabolic reprogramming and plant defense response following recognition of general elicitors in both resistant and susceptible genotypes.

of special interest were  <dig> genes exclusively modulated in the resistant genotype. given the functional categories and, in some cases, the specific genes affected by the oomycete, we presume that the resistance mechanism observed in our study is quite similar to that found in v. riparia following p. viticola infection  <cit> .

genes encoding for recognition and signal transduction components, such as two receptor-like protein kinases  and one tir-nbs receptor , were slightly activated. a calcium-dependent protein kinase  was also specifically induced in the resistant offspring suggesting that this secondary messenger may play a role in the defense response. a major role, however, seems to be played by ethylene as a signaling molecule. several transcripts involved in ethylene biosynthesis , as well as downstream ethylene responsive factors , appeared to be induced. interestingly, we detected transcriptional activation of genes encoding for a v. vinifera osmotin-like protein  and a β <dig> -glucanase , which belong respectively to class  <dig> and class  <dig> pathogenesis-related proteins. several studies have proved that ethylene modulates grapevine pr- <dig> and pr- <dig> genes  <cit>  and have shown the role these play in resisting biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens  <cit> . consistent with previous reports regarding p. viticola-infected grapevine leaf discs  <cit> , we also observed accumulation of a pr <dig>  and a pr <dig>  transcript at  <dig> hpi.

resveratrol accumulation is strictly controlled at the transcriptional level by regulation of the steady state of stilbene synthase transcripts  <cit> , both during development  <cit>  and under elicitation  <cit> . however, no transcriptional regulators have been identified so far. as expected, we found two isoforms of stilbene synthase,   <cit>  and   <cit> , which were activated in the resistant individual at  <dig> hpi. on the other hand, no modulation was observed in the susceptible genotypes. the timing of the induction is consistent with our biochemical results and with the literature  <cit> . in particular, strong up-regulation of the isoform  , between  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, is indeed compatible with the complex profile of viniferins accumulated in the resistant offspring at six days post infection.

interestingly, cdna-aflp analysis revealed induction of the expression of two peroxidase genes  in the resistant offspring at  <dig> hpi. peroxidases are known to catalyse oxidation of trans-resveratrol in the presence of h2o <dig>  giving rise to a resveratrol radical which then oligomerizes to form the stilbenoid oligomers  <cit> .

we found three other induced genes belonging to the phenylpropanoid metabolism, encoding for a caffeoyl-coa o-methyltransferase , a flavonoid 3', 5'-hydroxylase  and a dihydroflavonol reductase . although we did not check accumulation of monolignols and proanthocyanidins in the infected leaves, they are known to play a role in the plant's defense response. monolignols are essential for cell wall reinforcement  <cit>  and proanthocyanidins are toxic compounds for pathogens  <cit> .

the defense response in biotrophic interactions also involves primary metabolism reprogramming  <cit> . in our study, several genes which could be associated with protein degradation appeared to be induced by p. viticola in the resistant genotype, as reviewed previously for other plant-pathogen interactions  <cit> .

interestingly, a ubiquitin e3-ligase with ring-h <dig> domain  and a ubiquitin protein  were induced upon infection, as observed in v. riparia  <cit> . many other genes encoding for catabolic enzymes of proteins  and carbohydrates  were also up-regulated at  <dig> hpi.

most of the  <dig> modulated genes specific to susceptible individuals turned out to be induced  but did not exhibit a coherent expression profile in either susceptible genotypes. this analysis does not, therefore, allow us to draw conclusions about the mechanisms underlying grapevine-p. viticola compatibility, also because  <dig> of these genes showed the same cdna-aflp profile in the resistant genotype.

among the modulated genes, we found  <dig> genes whose modulated expression had no common rule in the resistant versus the two susceptible genotypes. this group contained genes encoding for a plastidic aldolase  and for photosynthetic proteins such as chlorophyll a-b binding proteins , a cytochrome b  and a ribulose 1-5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase . most of the genes were already down-regulated in teroldego at  <dig> hpi and highly activated in the resistant offspring, mainly at  <dig> hpi. down-regulation of photosynthesis-related genes following pathogen infection in susceptible genotypes during compatible interactions has already been widely reported  <cit> . up-regulation of the photosynthetic genes in resistant genotypes, as reported here, has been described in only a few cases  <cit> . this could be an alternative strategy adopted by the cell to gain energy for defense response, as opposed to induction of invertase activity previously described in the case of p. viticola infection  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this work reports a biochemical and transcriptomic analysis of downy mildew resistant and susceptible individuals selected from a grapevine crossing population  which segregates for resistance and stilbenoid content traits.

a strong negative correlation between the concentrations of stilbenoid viniferins in the leaves and the progress of infection was demonstrated. moreover, a comprehensive transcriptome profiling of resistant and susceptible individuals of the cross following infection led to the identification of a set of genes specifically modulated in the resistant genotype which should be taken into account in future breeding programs.
