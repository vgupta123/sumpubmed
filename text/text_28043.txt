BACKGROUND
developmental dyslexia is characterized by a difficulty in written language processing in persons possessing the intelligence and motivation considered necessary for accurate and fluent reading. more formally, it has been defined as a specific developmental impairment in the ability to read and spell despite adequate educational resources, average non-verbal intelligence, no obvious sensory deficits and appropriate socio-cultural opportunities  <cit> . dyslexia occurs in all languages and is perhaps the most common developmental learning disorder affecting children with prevalence rates ranging from 5% to  <dig> %  <cit> . both, prospective and retrospective longitudinal studies indicate that dyslexia is a chronic, persistent condition  <cit>  and, thus, does not represent a developmental lag  <cit> . over time, poor and good readers tend to maintain their relative positions along the spectrum of reading ability. however, adult dyslexic readers have problems that differ from those of dyslexic children. their main problems are poor spelling, slow reading, decoding, and nonword-reading  <cit> .

most researchers agree that developmental dyslexia is a disorder of neurobiological origin. family history is one important risk factor:  <dig> to  <dig> percent of children with a dyslexic parent are also dyslexic  <cit> . independent research groups identified gene-loci on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> that appear to be linked to dyslexia , whereas loci on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> have been reported by single research groups only  <cit> . the exact relationship between biological and cognitive factors causing the disorder is still under debate, however . theories proposed to explain developmental dyslexia include the visual theory  <cit> , the rapid auditory processing theory  <cit> , the cerebellar theory  <cit> , the magnocellular theory  <cit>  and the phonological theory  <cit> .

a great number of behavioral and event-related brain potential  studies have been aimed at seeking evidence for these theories and thus have used rather simple stimuli . the question to what extent different aspects of language processing are impaired has been addressed to a much lesser extent. therefore, the present study investigates the processing of visually presented pairs of words by means of erps in three different conditions: a phonological or rhyme judgment task , a semantic judgment task , and a syntactic judgment task .

erps can be used to study language processing  because different components have been found to be sensitive to semantic and syntactic aspects of language processing. for example, the n <dig> component of the erp is a negative peak usually occurring approximately  <dig> ms post-stimulus. it is generally reduced for visually or auditorily presented words that are semantically primed, i.e. for target words that are preceded by a related word, or that are part of a semantically congruous sentence . the prevailing interpretation of the n <dig> is that its amplitude varies as a function of the ease with which a word can be integrated into the overall meaning representation that is built up on the basis of the preceding language input, be it a sentence or a single word  <cit> . in line with this interpretation, n400-amplitude has been found to be influenced by phonological information as well  <cit> . as an example, rugg  <cit>  observed that when the second of two visually presented words rhymed with the first, the n <dig> for the second word was reduced compared to a non-rhyming word. the scalp distribution of this n400-effect for rhyming words is similar to that of the semantic priming effect. typically, the n <dig> has a broad scalp distribution with a slight lateralization to the right and a maximum at centro-parietal locations  <cit> .

syntactic violations have been reported to elicit negativities that differ in timing and scalp distribution from those observed for semantic incongruencies   <cit> .

erp-studies of semantic and phonological processing in dyslexic readers have yielded mixed results. some authors reported delayed, reduced or absent n <dig> word priming effects for adult  <cit>  and adolescent dyslexics  <cit> . these findings were interpreted as reflecting problems in the engagement of long-term semantic memory. these deficits have been found to vary as a function of presentation rate   <cit> , word frequency   <cit> , mode of stimulus presentation , and subtype of reading disability   <cit> . in contrast, bonte and blomert , silva-pereyra et al. , and rüsseler et al.   <cit>  observed normal n <dig> priming effects in dyslexic and poor reading children and adults, respectively.

syntactic processing in dyslexia has not often been the subject of investigation with erps, and all of the studies to date have employed sentence reading tasks. leikin  <cit>  found higher amplitudes and longer latencies for the p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> in dyslexic readers that were interpreted as suggesting the existence of a syntactic processing weakness in dyslexic readers. rispens  <cit>  obtained no differences between normal and dyslexic readers in the elan, an early, left frontal negativity reflecting a highly automatised processing phase of syntactic parsing  <cit> . as in the aforementioned studies of leikin and coworkers, the p <dig> was changed in dyslexics, but only for some forms of grammatical violations. a recent study by sabisch and co-workers  <cit>  presented phrase structure violations in passive sentences to dyslexic children and controls. while control children showed an early starting bilaterally distributed anterior negativity and a late centro-parietal positivity , dyslexics erps were characterized by a delayed left lateralized anterior negativity, followed by a p <dig>  the authors concluded that early automatic phrase structure building processes, which are reflected in the anterior negativity, are delayed in dyslexic children. furthermore, the bilateral distribution of the early effect in controls was taken to suggest an involvement of prosodic processes localized in the right hemisphere in addition to the left hemispheric syntactic processes. the left-lateralized negativity in dyslexic on the other hand was interpreted in the sense of phonological impairment in dyslexic children  which might lead to an impariment of syntactic processes. thus, there is evidence for syntactic processing difficulties in dyslexic readers, but the exact nature of the problems is still a matter of debate.

the heterogenity of the findings in erp-research on semantic, phonological, and syntactic processing in dyslexia can be attributed to several factors. first, different tasks have been used . second, dyslexics taking part in the above mentioned studies differed with respect to age and level of reading impairment. finally, semantic, phonological and syntactic processing have not been studied in the same sample of dyslexics outside of the sentence context. thus, in the present study, semantic, phonological and syntactic processing was investigated in a same sample of adult normal and dyslexic readers. to this purpose, we used the presentation of word pairs rather than sentences.

as stated earlier, three word reading tasks were employed. in the rjt, subjects had to decide whether the second of two consecutively presented words rhymed with the first. in the sjt, participants had to judge whether the second word was semantically related to the first whereas in the gjt, it had to be decided whether the gender of the critical word matched that indicated by the first word. erps were computed relative to the presentation of the second word of the consecutively presented word pairs.

we decided to include only high-achieving dyslexic readers  in our sample to minimize the chances of studying individuals with another comorbid developmental disorder, such as specific language impairment , adhd or developmental coordination disorder . thus, any deficit in language processing found in the present study can be viewed as a "core deficit" of developmental dyslexia.

because of the well-known difficulties in phonological processing in dyslexia  <cit> , we expected a delay of erp effects in the rjt. to the extent that these difficulties might propagate to later processing stages , a delay in the erp effects to gender and semantic violations was also expected.

event-related brain potentials
rjt
for the first  <dig> ms the erps to congruent and incongruent words are almost identical. however, beginning approximately  <dig> ms after the onset of the word the erps to incongruent, non-rhyming words display a more negative-going waveform . this effect is most prominent at central and parietal electrode locations and slightly larger for right hemisphere sites . the incongruency effect is reflected by the difference waves  for normal and dyslexic readers. obviously, the n <dig> starts and peaks earlier in normal compared to dyslexic readers. by contrast, the n <dig> persists much longer in dyslexics. statistically, this is reflected in an earlier n <dig> onset latency for normal compared to dyslexic readers  and an earlier n <dig> peak latency  =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  measured at c4).

due to the different n <dig> peak latencies, amplitude differences between normal and dyslexic readers were analyzed using the n <dig> peak amplitude values. the negative maximum for each subject was determined in a time-window ranging from  <dig> –  <dig> ms. in contrast to the visual impression , no significant n <dig> amplitude difference between the groups emerged at any electrode. the analysis of the differences waves yielded the same pattern of results.

the incongruency effect  turned out to be highly significant for both, dyslexic and normal readers .

statistical evaluation of the n <dig>  and the anterior negativity . the f- and p-values for the main effect of word type  are shown for the different electrode clusters used . as a further illustration, the results for the single electrode c <dig> are also shown. note that in all analyses except for the midline electrodes, the word type by electrode interactions were significant . mean amplitudes in the following time-windows were used: rjt:  <dig> –  <dig> ms; sjt:  <dig> –  <dig> ms; gjt:  <dig> –  <dig> ms.

sjt
for the first  <dig> ms the erps to words following semantically congruent primes and to words following incongruent primes are virtually identical. however, beginning approximately  <dig> ms after the onset of the word, the erps to incongruent words display a more negative-going waveform . this effect is most prominent at central and parietal electrode locations and again is slightly larger for right hemisphere sites . the incongruent – congruent difference waves  suggest that the n <dig> has the same onset latency for normal and dyslexic readers but that it is more extended in time in the dyslexic group. indeed, n400-onset-latency does not differ between dyslexic and normal readers . however, while the n <dig> amplitude seems to be larger in the dyslexic group no significant group differences were obtained for the mean amplitude in the  <dig> to  <dig> ms and  <dig> to  <dig> ms time windows . in addition, no group by anteriority or group by laterality interactions were seen. again, the incongruency effect  turned out to be highly significant for both groups .

an analysis of the mean amplitude values of the difference waves at electrode p <dig> revealed a strong tendency for the n <dig> to persist longer in dyslexics compared to the controls  =  <dig> , p < .074).

gjt
for the first  <dig> ms the erps to syntactically correct words and to syntactically incorrect words show a very similar waveform. however, beginning at approximately  <dig> ms the erps to grammatically incorrect words  display a more negative going waveform . this effect is most prominent at central and right temporal electrode locations as is evident in the topographic isovoltage maps .

the difference waves  show an anterior negativity which starts earlier in normal compared to dyslexic readers. this is reflected by onset latency differences between the two groups . due to the differences in onset latency of the anterior negativity, peak amplitude for each subject was determined in a time-window ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> ms to evaluate amplitude differences between the groups. despite the impression of a slightly larger peak amplitude for the control group, the anovas did not show any significant main effect of group or a significant interaction between the group and the electrodes factors. the incongruency effect  turned out to be highly significant for both groups .

comparison between the three tasks
the topographies of the incongruency effects can be appreciated from the maps presented in figures  <dig> to  <dig>  the topographies for rhyme and semantic tasks are very similar. in contrast, the anterior negativity in the gjt shows a more frontal distribution for both groups. distributions are very similar for both groups. statistically, this is reflected in non-significant group  by electrode  interactions in anovas of the standardized mean amplitudes in the n400/anterior negativity time-windows . furthermore, in anovas of the standardized data comprising the repeated measures factors task  and electrode , significant interactions emerged for task and electrode  =  <dig> , p < .0001; dyslexics: f =  <dig> , p < .002). post-hoc comparisons revealed that the gjt-anterior negativity topography differs from both, the sjt and the rjt topography of the n <dig> in dyslexics as well as controls. no differences were seen between sjt and rjt.

discussion
the present study employed phonological, semantic, and syntactic judgment tasks to investigate the processing of visually presented words in adult dyslexic and normal readers with event-related brain potentials. normal readers responded faster compared to dyslexics in all three tasks. furthermore, both, dyslexic as well as normal readers were faster in their responses in the rhyme judgment compared to the other two tasks. in all three tasks the incongruent words were characterized by more negative going erps of different distributions. the onset latencies of these negative effects were delayed in dyslexic readers compared to controls in the phonological judgment and in the gender judgment task, but not in the semantic judgment task. peak amplitudes did not differ between the two groups. in the phonological judgment and the semantic judgment tasks the incongruency effects persisted longer in the dyslexic groups. while some authors  <cit>  have pointed out that the phonological and semantic effects have different distributions, we will use the label n <dig> for both, the semantic and phonological incongruency effects, while the syntactic effect will be termed anterior negativity.

the phonological n <dig> displayed a delayed onset and persisted longer in our sample of adult dyslexic readers. this indicates that adult dyslexics have difficulties with phonological processing of written words, a finding that is compatible with the notion of a phonological core deficit in developmental dyslexia  <cit> . in line with previous research  <cit> , we observed a normal n <dig> semantic priming effect in adult dyslexic readers: n <dig> onset latency was not delayed for dyslexics in the semantic judgment task, and n <dig> peak amplitude was comparable in impaired and normal readers. as was the case with the phonological task, the semantic n <dig> persisted longer in dylexics. furthermore, they needed longer to perform the semantic judgment task. thus, it seems that dyslexic readers need more time and effort for semantic integration processes. similar results were obtained in a sentence reading task using slow presentation rates comparable to the ones used here .

with regard to syntactic processing, we observed a delayed onset and a longer persistence of the anterior negativity as well as prolonged response times indicating syntactic processing difficulties in dyslexic adults. interestingly, in an auditory sentence comprehension task in dyslexic children  <cit>  a delayed anterior negativity was observed as well. moreover, in this study normal readers showed a bilateral distribution of the negativity , while the strong left lateralization in the dyslexics suggested no contribution of prosodic/phonological processes in the detection of the phrase structure violations. this pattern might be taken to suggest an impairment of phonological processing which results in problems of automatic syntactic processing. our own data lend themselves to similar interpretation.

to summarize, the present experiment suggest that adult dyslexic readers do not only show phonological difficulties in written word processing but also have problems in syntactic and semantic integration processes. remediation programs created for dyslexic adult readers should take these processing deficits into account.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study replicates the well-known finding that dyslexics are phonologically impaired . furthermore, we show that they also have difficulties in other, non-phonological aspects of reading . specifically, semantic and syntactic integration seem to require more effort for dyslexic readers and take longer irrespective of the reading task that has to be performed. these aspects of reading impairment in dyslexia should be taken into account when designing new interventions for dyslexic readers.
