BACKGROUND
high consumption of saturated fatty acids  is associated with increased serum levels of cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins , considered risk factors for the occurrence of cardiovascular disease  <cit> . the sfas prevalent in beef fat are the myristic , palmitic  and stearic  fatty acids  <cit> . the polyunsaturated fatty acids  present in beef, such as linoleic  and linolenic , and monounsaturated , as oleic acid  protect the cardiovascular system, since moderate consumption has been linked to decreasing serum cholesterol and increasing high-density lipoprotein  .

furthermore, the fat of ruminants is a natural source of conjugated isomers of linoleic acid , such as c18: <dig> cis- <dig> trans- <dig>  <cit> , which are synthesized in the rumen as a result of biohydrogenation of fatty acids, performed by microorganisms  <cit> . the clas have a positive effect on human health, related to anticancer activity, immune functions, and potential beneficial effects on coronary heart disease  <cit> . strategies such as diet  <cit>  and gene manipulation  <cit>  have been used to satisfy the growing consumer demand for protein sources with healthier lipid profile. thus, regions associated with the expression of beef fatty acid profile have been identified aiming to locate key genes in the genome  that contribute to these features. this genomic tool will assist the use of information that is beneficial to human health.

recently, several genome-wide association studies using taurine breeds and their crosses  have identified genetic variants for fatty acid  profile in beef. these results would allow producers to select for desirable nutritional values with respect to meat fa that could increase beef value and consumer satisfaction. however, there are limited number of genomic association studies with a large sample size that aim to determine genome regions associated with the meat fatty acid profile of zebu cattle reared in tropical conditions  <cit> . the study of  <cit>  utilized  <dig> nellore steers, sired from  <dig> unrelated sires, from an experimental herd, and applied the bayes b method to perform the genome-wide association analysis. in the literature, there is some controversy regarding the capacity of different methods to identify genomic regions related to phenotypes due to differences in method presuppositions . moreover, it is important to perform genome-wide association studies  in indicine populations due to differences in environment and management conditions, and also differences in allele frequency of genetic markers and qtl, that would influence the results. the identification of genomic regions that affect the meat fatty acid composition may become an important and highly applicable tool to improve the nutritional value of zebu meat given the expensive and difficult nature of collecting phenotypic records.

the objective of this study was to identify regions associated with saturated, mono- and polyunsaturated and n- <dig> to n- <dig> ratios, in the longissimus thoracis muscle from confined nellore, using the single-step method.

RESULTS
fatty acid profile
the individual fatty acids with the highest concentration in the intramuscular fat of longissimus thoracis were c16: <dig>  c18: <dig> cis- <dig>  c18: <dig> trans- <dig>  and c18: <dig>  representing  <dig>  % of its fat composition . these results agreed with those reported by some authors  <cit>  who observed high levels of palmitic, stearic and oleic fas. some authors  <cit>  also reported that palmitic fatty acid was the predominant fa in beef fat. in nellore finished in feedlot  <cit> , oleic acid  displayed the highest concentration in intramuscular fat. the myristic and palmitic fas are associated with an increase in circulating ldl cholesterol due to interference with hepatic ldl receptors  <cit> . the saturated fatty acid were predominant, followed by the mufas and pufas. similar results  <cit>  were reported for nellore cattle,  <dig>  % ,  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  % . however, studies using taurine  <cit>  and nellore  <cit>  breeds found similar concentrations for sfa and mufa,  <dig> and  <dig> ; and  <dig> , and  <dig>  %, respectively.

in the present study, the n-6:n- <dig> ratio was less than 4: <dig>  the value recommended by the department of health and some authors  <cit> . excessive amounts of n- <dig> and a high n-6:n- <dig> ratio can lead to pathogenies, including cardiovascular, inflammatory, cancer and autoimmune diseases while increased levels of omega- <dig> fatty acids help to suppress such effects  <cit> . studies have associated a 4: <dig> ratio to 70 % decrease in mortality of humans, and also to preventing cardiovascular diseases  <cit> . the department of health recommends values above  <dig>  for the pufa/sfa ratio. the average value for this ratio in this study is below this limit . a pufa/sfa ratio of  <dig>  has been reported in beef purchased at supermarkets in the uk  <cit> . however, this pufa/sfa ratio may vary depending upon genetic and dietary factors  <cit> .

heritability estimates
the gibbs sampling approach was used to estimate de variance components and the convergence for all estimated parameters was verified through inspection of trace-plots and the geweke’s  <cit>  and heidelberger and welch convergence diagnostic  <cit>  indicated convergence of the chain. thus, the burn-in period considered was sufficient to reach the convergence in all parameter estimates. the posterior marginal distributions of heritability estimates for fatty acid profile, presented showed accurate values, tending to normal distribution . the symmetric distributions of central tendency statistics are indicative that the analyses are reliable.table  <dig> descriptive statistics for the fatty acids profile of nellore beefa

the heritability estimates for the individual fatty acids profile of intramuscular fat in the longissimus thoracis muscle were mostly moderate, but low for the c18: <dig>  c16: <dig> and cla cis- <dig> trans- <dig> acids and high for the c12: <dig> and cla trans- <dig> cis- <dig> acids . the linolenic fa heritability estimate obtained in this study was similar to that found by some authors   <cit>  and lower than that reported by other studies   <cit> . however, higher estimates have been reported for linolenic acid in other studies   <cit> , and also for palmitoleic acid   <cit>  and   <cit> . higher heritability estimates were reported for linoleic fa,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, in the intramuscular fat of japanese black cattle, suggesting that genetic influence on linoleic acid varies among breeds  <cit> . lower and similar heritability was estimated for myristic  and palmitic  fas  <cit> , respectively, while studies with nellore estimated low heritability for these fas, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> . however, studies  <cit>  reported high estimates for the myristoleic fa  and  <cit>  also found high estimates for myristic , palmitic , myristoleic  and linoleic . other authors also estimated low heritability estimates for the stearic  <cit> , cla cis- <dig> trans- <dig>  <cit>  and arachidonic  <cit>  fas.

the heritability estimates for the sum of omega- <dig> series fatty acids, the n-6:n- <dig> ratio, and the sum of saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids and their ratios were low . however, moderate heritability estimates were obtained for the sum of monounsaturated fatty acids and the sum of n- <dig> and n- <dig> fatty acids. studies estimated low heritability estimates for sfa and mufa and moderate values for n- <dig> and n- <dig>  <cit> . low to moderate heritability estimates for pufa , mufa  and sfa  have been reported  <cit> . nevertheless, other studies reported higher heritability estimates for these groups of fatty acids,  <dig>  for pufa,  <dig>  to  <dig>  for sfa and  <dig>  to  <dig>  for mufa in japanese black cattle  <cit> . recently, authors also estimated high heritability for sfa  and mufa  and, therefore, concluded that there is sufficient genetic variation in the fatty acid profile of cattle subcutaneous fat to respond to selection  <cit> . the results of this study suggest that it is possible to change the lipids composition of intramuscular fat of nellore meat through selection. this information is important for breeding programs of zebu breeds that aim at improving the beef fatty acid composition.

in gwas studies of intramuscular fat and fat deposition in meat of nellore cattle, using the same marker density as in this study, the authors found 33genomic regions  associated with the traits, deposition of intramuscular fat and meat fatty acid profile  <cit> . similarly, other gwas for angus cattle, using a 54 k genotyping panel, found fifty-seven genomic regions associated with the fatty acids profile trait in meat  <cit> . for any fatty acid, non-overlapping regions were found with the results obtained by  <cit> , who also performed gwas for beef fa profile in several breeds. even though no overlapping regions were found for the same fatty acids, regions in the same chromosome were found, but at the longer distances . this inconsistent between our results and previous studies could be due the differences between studied populations , distribution of linkage disequilibrium among the causal mutations and genetic markers, model applied to perform the gwas, genetic marker density. in addition, physiological and metabolic factors involved in those populations might help to explain the differences observed by researchers. in this sense, it is important to highlight that the expression of fa profile in beef is probably influenced by many loci of small effect. thus, it is expected that each pcg contribute differently for the additive genetic variance of each fa in different populations, environments and management conditions.

saturated fatty acids
a total of  <dig> genomic regions that explain more than 1 % of genotypic were found for total saturated fatty acids, c12: <dig>  c14: <dig>  c16: <dig> and c18: <dig>  these regions are distributed on chromosomes bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig>  and bta <dig> .

the vacenic fatty acid  was associated with eight regions in seven different chromosomes. one of these regions, on bta <dig> at 88 mb, was the same associated with lauric , thus the pcg erssb gene was described above.

polyunsaturated fatty acids 
forty genomic regions explained more than 1 % of the additive genetic variation for the polyunsaturated fatty acids group, as: c20: <dig> n- <dig>  c18: <dig> cis- <dig> cis <dig> n- <dig>  c18: <dig> n- <dig>  c22: <dig> n- <dig> and c20: <dig> n- <dig> cis- <dig> cis- <dig> cis- <dig> .

on bta <dig> at 63 mb, the tmem <dig> gene was associated with the total pufa. tmem  <dig> variants were associated with decreased fasting plasma insulin and also with the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, indicating plausible effect through impaired insulin secretion  <cit> . the fatty acid c20: <dig> n- <dig> was associated with eight different genomic regions . on bta <dig> at 84 mb, the fbxo <dig> gene was associated with arachidonic acid. bta <dig> at 61 mb  had five associated genes: abca <dig>  abca <dig>  abca <dig>  map2k <dig>  and prkar1a. the genes of the abc group are associated with cholesterol metabolism and lipids homeostasis  <cit> , as well as abca <dig>  abca <dig> and abca <dig>  <cit> . the map2k <dig> gene was associated with backfat thickness, marbling score and carcass weight in hanwoo cattle  <cit>  and identified in two selection signatures in galloway and gelbvieh cattle  <cit> . the prkar1a is involved in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism and is a component of the signal transduction mechanism of certain gpcrs   <cit> . mutations in this gene have been associated with obesity phenotypes in humans  <cit> .

on bta <dig> at 25 mb, the elovl fatty acid elongase  <dig>  gene was associated with the fatty acid c20: <dig> n- <dig>  this gene plays an important role in the elongation of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids up to  <dig> carbons , condensing enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids of very long chains, specifically the current polyunsaturated acyl-coa with higher activity c18: <dig> acyl-coa  <cit> . in mammals, seven enzymes have been identified in the elovl family . each elovl enzyme has a distinct distribution in different tissues, and different enzymes exhibit different preferences for the fatty acid substrate. the elovl <dig> and elovl <dig> genes are involved in the production/synthesis of palmitic , palmitoleic , stearic  and oleic  fatty acids, important beef fatty acids. therefore, the role of elovl <dig> and elovl <dig> genes in the synthesis of these fatty acids is of great importance in beef breeding programs  <cit> .

nine qtl regions were associated with c22: <dig> n- <dig> fa, but pcgs were found in only two of these regions: bta <dig> at 92 mb and bta <dig> at 44 mb. bta <dig> at 92 mb was associated with the gpr <dig> gene. this gene encodes a member of the receptors superfamily coupled to the g protein. this encoded protein contains a seven-transmembrane receptor domain bound to calcium. it is expressed in the central nervous system  <cit>  and associated with the body condition score in humans  <cit> . bta <dig> at 44 mb was also associated with the fatty acid c18: <dig> cis- <dig> cis- <dig> n- <dig> and, therefore, pcg adtrp has been described above.

the fatty acid c20: <dig> n- <dig> cis- <dig> cis- <dig> cis- <dig> was associated with seven regions in seven different chromosomes, but pcgs were identified in only two regions: bta <dig> at 62 mb and bta <dig> at 1 mb. the pcg pellino e <dig> ubiquitin protein ligase  <dig>  was identified on bta <dig> at 62 mb. bta <dig> at 1 mb had two pcgs identified: family with sequence similarity  <dig>  member b  and dedicator of cytokinesis  <dig> . dock <dig> is involved in cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for lymphocyte migration in response to chemokines. this pgc activates rac <dig> and rac <dig>  but not the cdc <dig>  because it acts as a guanine exchange factor  nucleotide that changes the gdp to free gtp  <cit> .

omega  <dig> and  <dig> fatty acids
a total  <dig> genomic regions accounted for more than 1 % of the genetic variance for n- <dig> and n- <dig> fatty acids, and the n-6:n- <dig> ratio .

on bta <dig> at 7 mb, bta <dig> at 92 mb, bta <dig> at 88 mb, bta <dig> at 1 mb, bta <dig> at 17 mb, and bta <dig> at 12 mb were associated with total n- <dig> fatty acids. on the other hand, no pcgs were identified on bta <dig> at 88 mb, bta <dig> at 1 mb, and bta <dig> at 12 mb. moreover, bta <dig> at mb 7 mb and bta <dig> at  <dig> were also associated with the c18: <dig> cis- <dig> and c22: <dig> n- <dig> fatty acids  and, therefore, with the nos1ap and gpr <dig> genes described above, respectively.

on bta <dig> at 63 mb, bta <dig> at 49 mb, bta <dig> at 97 mb, bta <dig> at 36 mb, bta <dig> at 80 mb and bta <dig> at 44 mb were associated with total n- <dig> fatty acids. the bta <dig> at 63 mb harbors the gene transmembrane protein  <dig> . this same region has also been associated with total polyunsaturated fatty acids . the bta <dig> at 49 mb was the largest region associated with the omega fatty acids group, where the bcar <dig> gene is found. this gene has been linked to breast cancer in humans  <cit> . bta <dig> at 36 mb, bta <dig> at 80 mb and bta <dig> at 44 mb have been associated previously with other long-chain fatty acids, whereas the latter region explained the greatest proportion of variance . bta <dig> at 36 mb and bta <dig> at 80 mb were also associated with total polyunsaturated fatty acids and the genes already described. bta <dig> at 44 mb was also associated with the polyunsaturated fas: c18: <dig> cis- <dig> cis- <dig> n- <dig>  c22: <dig> n- <dig> and total pufa.fig.  <dig> manhattan plot of the genome-wide association study for sum omega- <dig> in nellore. the x-axis represents the chromosomes, and the y-axis shows the proportion of genetic variance explained by windows of  <dig> adjacent snps omega- <dig> fatty acids in nellore



the single step method method allows to combine the information of genotyped and non-genotyped animals in the genetic evaluation process, thus expanding the scope and identification of potential regions associated with loci responsible for variations in the studied traits  <cit> . in this sense, some authors  <cit>  compared different gwas methodologies and reported that the single step method method partitions the genetic variance for a particular region among all snps markers. on the other hand bayesb or bayescpi methods, for example, penalizes the zero regions and tends to overestimate the genetic variability explained for each of the identified regions. there is some controversy regarding the capacity or ability of different methods to identify genomic regions associated with the phenotype . therefore, caution should be applied when interpreting results from different populations, using various methods because the identified associations depend on the strength or magnitude of the association, methodology, and implementation details.

in this study, we found several nearby areas of major qtl associated with groups of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, in nellore meat. these regions harbor interesting pcg, which are involved in lipid metabolism, as a constituent of cell membranes, receptors for reproductive hormones, biosynthesis and hydrolysis of phospholipids and membrane constituents, synthesis of protein kinases, transport and use of fatty acids and cholesterol, energy metabolism, elongation factors and synthesis of long-chain fatty acids in different species. among the many genes identified, the elovl <dig> gene located on chromosome bta <dig> at 25 mb and associated with the c20: <dig> n- <dig>  is highlighted. the genes responsible for the elongation of very-long-chain fatty acid  encode enzymes that play an important role in the elongation of long-chain fatty acids. the fatty acid synthesis involves a number of enzymes, such as fatty acid synthase , which is located on chromosome bta <dig> between  <dig> . <dig> and  <dig> .614 bp, while its variations have been related to fatty acid composition of angus beef  <cit> . in mammals, fasn synthesizes the fatty acids that contain up to  <dig> carbon atoms, and the genes of the elovls group produce long-chain fatty acids with  <dig> carbon atoms or more  <cit> .

the results of the present study pointed out some pcg that were found associated to several fa of different saturation state: the cdk <dig> gene was associated with c18: <dig> trans- <dig> and sfa; the tmem <dig> gene related to n- <dig> fatty acids and pufa; and the slc51a, pcyt1a, tctex1d, and galntl <dig> genes that influence the linoleic acid and also some individual saturated fatty acids, like the c14: <dig> and c16: <dig>  these results could be due to pleitropic effects, where the expression of differents fa could influenced by the same gene which acts in a coordinate manner to contribute to the synthesis of beef fa. similar findings were reported by  <cit> , where both genes, fasn and thrsp, exhibited pleiotropic effect for the most studided fa in angus cattle. genes involved in muscle lipid composition of  <dig> european bos taurus breeds were studied by  <cit> , which reported pleiotropic effects for genes like cri <dig>  dgat <dig>  foxo <dig>  mmp <dig>  soc <dig> and neb, affecting several beef fa.

the large number of genomic regions associated with the fatty acid profile found in this study should help to understand the genetic and metabolic mechanisms that determine the fatty acids profile of intramuscular fat, especially in zebu. according to the results of this study, the meat fatty acid profile of zebu is probably controlled by several qtl of small effect and, therefore, the identification of relevant genes or large effect seems to be difficult, since for most fatty acids, the contribution of each region or window for the additive genetic variation was small. therefore, strategies such as genomic selection using or considering the variability among markers at the same time would be more appropriate to improve the fatty acid profile of the bovine meat. the database used in the study is broad since it contains animals that participate in beef cattle breeding programs, and breeders that are sold and used in various regions of the country. therefore, the results should contribute to the selection and improvement of the meat quality from zebu raised in tropical conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
several genomic regions associated with qtl related to lipid metabolism and fatty acid composition were identified. the identification of such regions and the respective candidate genes associated with lipid metabolism and energy transport hormones such as, for example, elovl <dig>  essrg, pcyt1a and genes of the abc group , should contribute to improve the genetic knowledge regarding the fatty acids profile of nellore  and help to improve the selection of such traits to favor human health. in addition, these regions can be used in future fine mapping studies, whose primary function is to search for informative causative mutations. these polymorphisms can be inserted into customized low-density chips that assist a more cost-effective genetic evaluation.
