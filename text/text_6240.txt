BACKGROUND
the esat- <dig>  family collects small mycobacterial proteins secreted by mycobacterium tuberculosis, particularly in the early phase of growth. they were found in culture supernatant in the form of heterodimer with the related cfp- <dig>  proteins  <cit> . there are  <dig> esat- <dig> family members in m. tuberculosis h37rv; located in  <dig> genomic loci, their genes have been named as esxa-w  <cit> .

inspection of the genetic neighbourhood revealed that in five out of eleven cases the esx genes are flanked by blocks of conserved genes. besides esx genes, the other conserved regions encode pe and ppe proteins, atp-dependent chaperones of the aaa family, membrane-bound atpases, transmembrane proteins and serine proteases, which are known as mycosins  <cit> . these five esat- <dig> gene clusters were named regions  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> .

the genomes of m. tuberculosis h37rv, m. bovis and m. bovis bcg have been compared, and various regions of difference  have been identified. one of these regions, designated as rd <dig>  is a  <dig> bp region that is absent in all m. bovis bcg strains  <cit> . this deletion entirely removes the genomic fragment from rv <dig> to rv3879c. among the lost genes are esxb  and esxa , which respectively encode cfp- <dig> and esat- <dig> proteins. this deletion is thought to be responsible for the primary attenuation of m. bovis to m. bovis bcg  <cit> . moreover, using differential display to compare gene expression in m. tuberculosis h37rv and h37ra strains, rindi et al.  <cit>  showed that tb <dig>   is produced in the virulent, but not in the avirulent strain, a finding which suggests that this protein may be involved in functions that contribute significantly to the virulence of m. tuberculosis.

the secretion of cfp- <dig> and esat- <dig> proteins is promoted by a secretory apparatus that is encoded by the surrounding genes in the rd <dig> locus; these genes encode at least one transmembrane protein  and two aaa-family atpases   <cit> .

it is well known that cfp- <dig> and esat- <dig> are potent t-cell antigens that are recognized by tb patient sera  <cit> , but their precise role in infection and virulence is still to be clearly defined. they are thought to possess a cytolytic activity and to be involved in cell-to-cell spread in the host, thus facilitating the dissemination of infection among macrophage and dendritic cells  <cit> .

more recently, esat- <dig>  cfp- <dig> and their complex were demonstrated to modulate the macrophage signalling pathway, and in particular the erk 1/ <dig> map kinase pathway  <cit> . the modulation was exerted by a strong inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation and subsequent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/ <dig>  in the nucleus; this inhibition was achieved by an increase in phosphatase activity in the nucleus, which in turn caused dephosphorylation of perk1/ <dig> coming from the cytoplasm. the limitation of erk 1/ <dig> activation affected the expression of c-myc, a key factor in macrophage activation, and thus downregulated the expression of lps-inducible gene c-myc. moreover, the esat-6/cfp- <dig> complex was shown to be able to inhibit the production of reactive oxidative species  and to interfere with lps-induced ros production. as a consequence, the downregulation of lps-induced nuclear factor-kb  dna binding activity  <cit>  caused a reduced expression of several proinflammatory cytokines, such as tnf-α, il- <dig>  interferon-γ and nitric oxide synthase  <dig>  <cit> .

the multiple duplicates of the esat- <dig> gene cluster found in the genome of m. tuberculosis h37rv are also observable in the genomes of other mycobacteria, such as m. bovis, m. leprae, m. avium, and the avirulent strain m. smegmatis; it follows that the presence of the esat- <dig> gene cluster is a feature of some high-g+c gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . in particular, the m. smegmatis genome contains three of the five esat- <dig> gene cluster regions, namely regions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which in term of protein show  <dig> and 75% similarity to m. tuberculosis h37rv  <cit> . no deletion, frameshifts or stop codons were identified in any of these genes, and it is therefore assumed that these regions are functional  <cit> .

besides, in m. leprae genome, which is believed to contain the minimal gene set required for pathogenesis, functional copies of both ml0050/ml <dig> and ml2532/ml <dig>  are retained, a fact which suggests the importance of these proteins in mycobacterial virulence  <cit> .

in a previous work, we identified thirty-two genes, which we hypothesised as being organized in  <dig> operons, under zur  transcriptional control in m. tuberculosis; of these, five proteins belong to the esat-6/cfp- <dig> family   <cit> . while esxg  and esxh  are part of esat- <dig> cluster  <dig>  esxq, esxr, and esxs are physically associated, but do not belong to any of the five gene clusters  <cit> . interestingly, the same gene cluster  <dig> is induced by iron starvation and is repressed by iron and ider  <cit> . consistently with the notion that this gene cluster is dually regulated by zur and by ider, we identified two different promoters upstream of its first gene ; one overlaps the zur binding site, while the other overlaps the ider binding site  <cit> .

in this research we performed emsa experiments and transcriptional analysis of esat- <dig> cluster  <dig> in m. smegmatis. in contrast with what we had observed in m. tuberculosis, we found that in m. smegmatis esat- <dig> cluster  <dig> responds only to iron and not to zinc.

RESULTS
genetic organization of esat- <dig> cluster  <dig> and emsa experiments on msmeg <dig> and rv <dig> promoters
the transcriptional regulation of esat- <dig> cluster  <dig>  in m. tuberculosis is well documented  <cit> . the promoter region upstream of the rv <dig> gene  was found to be regulated by zur protein in a zinc-dependent manner, as well as by ider in an iron-dependent manner  <cit> . m. smegmatis esat- <dig> cluster  <dig> presents a similar genetic organization, and comprises  <dig> genes numbered msmeg0615-msmeg <dig>  .

sequence analysis of the msmeg <dig> upstream region revealed the presence of a hypothetical ider binding region  , while no evident region of homology with m. tuberculosis zur dna binding box  could be found.

to define metal-dependent regulation of cluster  <dig>  we cloned m. smegmatis zur  and ider  genes into the pgex-6p- <dig> vector. the corresponding proteins were expressed in escherichia coli xl1-blue and purified by on-column digestion with prescission protease . the quality of purified proteins was checked on sds polyacrylamide gel  and the molecular sizes were confirmed. purified m. smegmatis zur protein showed the molecular weight of  <dig> kda, similarly to m. tuberculosis zur, while ider protein showed the molecular weight of  <dig> kda .

in order to verify the regulation of msmeg0615-msmeg <dig> cluster, we used the m. smegmatis purified proteins in emsa experiments on the rv <dig> and msmeg <dig> upstream regions . as shown in figure 3a, m. smegmatis ider was able to bind both promoter regions, while m. smegmatis zur seemed to recognize and efficiently retard only the rv <dig> promoter, but not the corresponding region of m. smegmatis . the data suggest that cluster gene regulation differs between m. tuberculosis and m. smegmatis; we particularly note the lack of zinc regulation for the msmeg <dig> promoter.

determination of the transcriptional start site and effects of different metal ions on pr1
5' race experiment was performed to further characterize the m. smegmatis msmeg <dig>  promoter region. similarly to m. tuberculosis  <cit> , the hypothetical start site, mapping at - <dig> upstream of the msmeg <dig> gene , identified a consensus promoter sequence that partially overlapped the palindromic sequence  , which was highly homologous to the previously identified m. tuberculosis ider binding site  <cit> .

β-galactosidase assays were performed to better define the activity of the msmeg <dig> promoter . a fragment extending from - <dig> to + <dig>  which was obtained by amplification with pr1msf and pr1msr primers , and which contained the promoter region, was cloned in fusion with the lacz gene into the integrative plasmid pmyt <dig>  β-galactosidase activity was tested in sauton medium, in the presence and in the absence of metal ions. in accordance with emsa results, those data clearly demonstrated that m. smegmatis cluster  <dig> is repressed by iron, while other metal ions like zinc, nickel and manganese have no effect on its expression .

5'-race and transcriptional analysis of pr2
cluster  <dig> gene organization seems to exclude the presence of internal promoter regions with one exception; the distance between the ppe  and esxg  coding regions suggested the presence of an internal putative promoter upstream of m. tuberculosis esxg and the corresponding homologous msmeg <dig> gene . the short rv0287-rv <dig> and msmeg0620-msmeg <dig> intergenic regions were not analyzed, as the two genes had previously been reported to be cotranscribed  <cit> . to determine whether the putative pr <dig> promoter was present, we amplified the rv0286-rv <dig> and the msmeg0619-msmeg <dig> intergenic regions  and cloned them into pmyt <dig>  the recombinant plasmids were transformed into m. smegmatis, and β-galactosidase activity was measured.

as shown in figure  <dig>  the data suggest the presence of an alternative promoter just upstream of the esx genes, as enzymatic activity, particularly for the msmeg0619-msmeg <dig> intergenic region was significantly higher than that measured in the control culture . the data regarding m. tuberculosis are less clear, since detectable promoter activity was low.

to better define promoter sequences, we performed 5' race experiment. the transcriptional start site, indicated with an arrow in figure 2b, mapped at - <dig> upstream of the msmeg <dig> translational start codon. although no siga promoter consensus sequence was observed in the upstream region, we could found hypothetical - <dig> and - <dig> sequences that resembled those reported as to be possibly recognizable by m. tuberculosis sigh factor  <cit> . we did not identify any pr <dig> promoter sequence in m. tuberculosis, as the 5' race experiments were unsuccessful.

quantitative pcr on msmeg <dig> and msmeg <dig> genes and their homologs in m. tuberculosis
m. smegmatis mc <dig> was grown at different growth phases and in different stress conditions; rna was extracted, retrotranscribed and used in relative quantitative pcr  experiments. to determine the effect of pr <dig> and pr <dig> activity on cluster  <dig> genes, we analysed the expression of two representative coding regions, msmeg <dig> and msmeg <dig>  located immediately downstream of these promoters. siga  gene, which codes the primary sigma factor, was used as a normalizing reference. the normalized values were referred to gene level expression of m. smegmatis as grown in 7h <dig> medium to mid-log phase .

the data reveal  that the expression of msmeg <dig> and msmeg <dig> is essentially similar in most of the conditions analysed. the results confirm that metal deficiency  is associated with esat- <dig> cluster  <dig> derepression; the presence of zinc  has no effect on gene expression, while iron clearly determines gene repression .

both genes appear to be repressed in most of the other conditions, such as late phase of growth , nutrient starvation , surface stress , ethanol stress , oxidative stress , and heat shock . curiously, the msmeg <dig> and msmeg <dig> genes respond differently to acid stress , with the former induced by about 4-fold, and the latter appearing to be repressed.

rv <dig> and rv <dig> gene expression was monitored by means of qpcr to verify ph-dependent regulation in m. tuberculosis. with the siga gene as a normalizing reference, the data revealed a higher level of expression in acid stress conditions than was the case for 7h <dig> standard medium with respective inductions of about 3-fold  for rv <dig> and  <dig> -fold  for rv <dig> 

β-galactosidase activity in m. smegmatis cultures, transformed with pmyt <dig> derivatives carrying m. smegmatis and m. tuberculosis pr <dig> regions, revealed that promoter activities were significantly  lower under acid stress than in control conditions .

discussion
esat- <dig>  proteins, including the previously mentioned cfp- <dig> , form a large family that is defined on the following base: basis of protein size ; the occurrence of the cognate genes in pairs; their location downstream of a pe and ppe gene pair, which are coding mycobacterial protein with a characteristic proline-glutamic  and proline-proline-glutamic  motif.

the interest in esat genes derives from the observation that esxa and esxb genes are comprised in the rd <dig> , whose deletion is thought to be responsible for the primary attenuation of m. bovis in m. bovis bcg  <cit> . complementation experiments have demonstrated that mutations that abolish production or secretion of rd <dig> esat- <dig> proteins confer an attenuated phenotype in various animal models, which in turn suggests that esat-6/cfp- <dig> play an important role in survival and multiplication of m. tuberculosis within the host cell  <cit> .

moreover, esat- <dig> proteins have been identified as strong targets for human b- and t-cell response, a finding which stimulates great interest in the potential of these antigens for vaccine use  <cit> . besides esxa and esxb, esxh , included in cluster  <dig>  has also been identified as a strong antigen in tb patient and bcg vaccinated donor  <cit> . two other esat proteins , despite their high degree of identity with rv <dig>  display a unique epitope pattern  <cit> . these observations strengthen the hypothesis that these genes could encode proteins whose functions are similar, but whose recognition by the immune system differs; differential expression of individual genes could lead to antigenic variation, which would help mycobacteria to escape from the host defence. to better understand esx genes function it is important to investigate their expression in varying conditions and in differing phases of the infective process.

esx genes were also identified in other mycobacteria; in particular the fast growing m. smegmatis contains three esat- <dig> gene clusters, which correspond to the previously identified regions  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of m. tuberculosis. the finding that bacteria carrying esat- <dig> genes live in varying environmental niches suggests that, besides virulence, these proteins could have a more general role in mycobacterial physiology.

to better define the putative role of cluster  <dig> in mycobacterial pathogenicity and physiology, we decided to study esat cluster  <dig> gene regulation in m. smegmatis and in m. tuberculosis. as the rv <dig> promoter region had been previously characterized  <cit> , we analysed msmeg <dig> promoter region activity. our results suggest that regulation differs in these organisms; while in m. tuberculosis gene cluster  <dig> is controlled by ider and zur regulators in an iron- and zinc-dependent manner, in m. smegmatis only ider-dependent regulation is retained, while zinc has no effect on gene expression. iron is a growth limiting factor both in the environment and during human infection. in mammalian hosts this metal is bound to high affinity iron-binding proteins, and abnormal high iron levels in serum are associated with exacerbation of the disease  <cit> . it is worth noting that the differences in esat- <dig> cluster expression  <dig> in m. tuberculosis and m. smegmatis could be due to differences in the life styles of these organisms. as a pulmonary pathogen, m. tuberculosis has to confront with a zinc-deficient environment, as this metal's concentration is low in lung alveoli  <cit> . while esat- <dig> cluster  <dig> is known to be essential to virulence, the role of cluster  <dig> is still to be defined; nevertheless, iron- and zinc-dependent expression strongly suggest a high level expression in the lung during the infective process, and hence a contribution to the antigenic profile throughout the course of infection  <cit> .

to better understand the expression of esat- <dig> cluster  <dig> genes, it was important to verify whether internal promoters appear within this region; in both organisms, the presence of promoter upstream of msmeg <dig> and rv <dig> coding regions suggests that gene expression within esat- <dig> gene cluster could be differential. to better define the effect of each promoter on overall esx gene regulation, we compared msmeg <dig> and msmeg <dig> expression in varying conditions by means of relative quantitative pcr. as an internal control to normalize loaded rna we used siga, which encodes the mycobacterial major sigma factor  <cit> . siga is widely used as a standard in qpcr because its expression is constitutive in various growth phases and under differing stress conditions. an approximate 3-fold decrease in siga transcript was reported in m. tuberculosis during the stationary growth phase  <cit> ; these data do not seem to affect our results significantly, as we observed increased repression of this promoter in the stationary phase.

the expression of msmeg <dig> and msmeg <dig> genes is essentially similar; they appear to be repressed in most of the tested conditions, with the exception of acid stress . these data suggest the presence of two transcriptional units: the first, regulated by pr <dig> , encompasses the whole cluster, while the second, regulated by pr <dig>  includes the msmeg <dig> downstream genes. although previous studies  <cit>  noted the coordination of all genes expression within cluster  <dig> under zur regulation, divergence between rv <dig> and rv <dig> induction levels under acid stress and the appearance of an internal promoter also suggest that two overlapping transcriptional units exist.

as regards the hypothetical role of the cfp-10/esat- <dig> complex in escaping from the phagosomal compartment of professional phagocytic cells  <cit> , the finding of cluster  <dig> gene induction in acidic ph condition is surely noteworthy. acidification may indeed be a signal for the induction of genes needed in phagosome survival.

a previous transcriptional analysis by means of microarray failed in the identification of rv <dig> and rv <dig> among m. tuberculosis genes induced under acid stress  <cit> . this discordance could be explained with different sensitivity of the methodologies used in these investigations.

both ider and iron-regulated genes were previously reported to be upregulated during macrophage infection  <cit> . this apparent contradiction can be explained by direct or indirect inhibition exerted by environmental acid on ider function. indeed, to date no data suggest the presence of an alternative ph-dependent promoter upstream of esat- <dig> cluster 3; msmeg <dig> and rv <dig> gene induction could be indirect, presumably as an effect of the environment on ider function or stability. differential gene expression inside the esat- <dig> cluster could be related to the presence of the internal promoter pr <dig>  whose activity diminishes under acid stress. as pr <dig> seems to be a weak promoter, its effect in m. tuberculosis could be less evident, while in m. smegmatis it could effectively reduce pr2-regulated genes expression. unfortunately, it was not possible to identify pr <dig> promoter sequence in m. tuberculosis, as 5' race experiments were unsuccessful; the probable reason is low expression levels. in m. smegmatis, no siga consensus sequence could be found upstream of the 5' end of the transcript. we can hypothesize the involvement of an alternative sigma factor; indeed, this region showed sequence  that resembled the sequence putatively recognized by m. tuberculosis sigh  <cit> . however, in this organism, sigh is induced by heat shock and oxidative stress  <cit>  and we are accordingly unclear as to the meaning of this observation. on the other hand, a bioinformatics search has predicted the existence of  <dig> sigma factors in m. smegmatis, with a significant enrichment in the sigh subfamily  <cit> . these paralogous members might have acquired specific functions, and might be induced in varying as yet unidentified conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that esat- <dig> cluster  <dig> regulation in mycobacteria varies. particularly, in m. tuberculosis the gene cluster is induced by iron and zinc starvation and is repressed by ider and zur regulators. in m. smegmatis, only ider-dependent regulation is retained, while zinc has no effect on gene expression. differences in expression could be due to diversity in the life styles of these organisms. iron is a limiting growth factor in the environment and during human infection, but as a pulmonary pathogen m. tuberculosis also contend with a zinc-deficient environment. although the role of cluster  <dig> is not defined, induction in iron- and zinc-deficient condition, as pertain in the lung, strongly suggests a high level expression of this cluster during the infective process.

both in m. tuberculosis and in m. smegmatis we identified an internal promoter just upstream of the esx genes . these promoters seem to be repressed under acid stress, and thus to contribute to differential expression of this gene cluster in varying environmental conditions.
