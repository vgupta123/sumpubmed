BACKGROUND
arabidopsis, like most plant species, accumulates free proline  to high concentration in response to salt and drought stress. the physiological function of pro is subject to controversial debate, and arabidopsis plants with a reduced capacity to accumulate pro showed only a moderate decrease or no change in stress tolerance  <cit> . pro is suggested to act as a compatible osmolyte, a stabilising agent for macromolecules, a radical scavenger or as a nitrogen and energy store for the recovery phase  <cit> . other hypotheses attribute the beneficial function to the process of pro metabolism rather than the mere accumulation of pro. along this line, energy transfer between cellular compartments, regeneration of electron acceptors or signalling functions have been proposed  <cit> .

the biochemistry of pro biosynthesis and degradation has been intensively studied and most of the participating proteins and the genes encoding for these enzymes were characterised with respect to temporal and spatial expression patterns and enzymatic properties . the first step of pro synthesis is catalysed by pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase , which uses glutamate, nadph and atp to generate glutamate-γ-semialdehyde . gsa is in spontaneous equilibrium with the cyclic pyrroline-5-carboxylate , which is converted to pro by p5c reductase , again consuming nadph. arabidopsis contains two isoforms of p5cs that are differentially regulated. p5cs <dig>  expression was consistent with a housekeeping function, and the p5cs <dig> protein was found to be localised in the cytosol under normal conditions while being partially re-located to plastids during stress  <cit> . pro accumulation under stress conditions is primarily contingent upon induction of p5cs <dig>  expression. also p5cs <dig> was observed in the cytosol, partly as presumably inactive aggregates, and re-localised to plastids during stress  <cit> . p5cr seems to be predominantly localised in the cytosol, while some activity was also associated with plastid preparations  <cit> . however, direct investigations of the localisation and enzymatic properties of arabidopsis p5cr  are still pending. a second pathway for pro synthesis from ornithine had also been postulated, but characterisation of ornithine-δ-aminotransferase indicated that ornithine is degraded to glutamate inside the mitochondria prior to its conversion to pro by the standard pathway  <cit> . loss or gain of function mutants provided valuable evidence for the physiological role of pro accumulation, although the interpretation of the mutant phenotypes was always hampered by the primary function of pro in protein biosynthesis  <cit> .

for degradation, pro is imported into the mitochondria, where it is converted back to glutamate by the tightly coupled activities of pro dehydrogenase  and p5c dehydrogenase . in arabidopsis, one prodh  and one p5cdh  have been characterised at the molecular level. prodh <dig> and p5cdh expression is repressed by osmotic stress and upregulated by pro, with the changes being more pronounced for prodh <dig>  <cit> . also in flowers, strong expression of prodh <dig> was observed in the stigma and in pollen, while p5cdh is only upregulated in pollen  <cit> . mutants with defects in pro degradation grew without obvious phenotypic differences under greenhouse conditions, only a slight decrease in seed quality was noted for p5cdh mutants  <cit> . common to the p5cdh mutants and the prodh <dig> mutant pdh1- <dig> were an enhanced and prolonged accumulation of pro during stress and an unexpected hypersensitivity to external pro supply in the absence of stress. in wildtype plants, external application of harmful amounts of pro caused the loss of mitochondrial and plastid integrity  <cit> . hare et al.  hypothesised that excess pro degradation would cause misdirection of electrons to o <dig> in mitochondria and plastids due to electron overflow or acceptor limitation, respectively. recent results confirmed the pro-dependent production of reactive oxygen species  in mitochondria, an effect that was more pronounced in prodh overexpressing or p5cdh mutant plants  <cit> .

the only obvious gap in the molecular characterisation of pro metabolism in arabidopsis remains a second isoform of prodh , which has been identified as an expressed gene with high homology to prodh <dig>  <cit> . the predicted pre-proteins of prodh <dig> and prodh <dig> share 75% identical amino acids . hanson et al.  demonstrated a direct induction of prodh <dig> by the sucrose-repressed transcription factor bzip <dig>  <cit> . however, until now the enzymatic functionality of prodh <dig> had not been addressed. here, we demonstrate that prodh <dig> expressed in yeast can mediate pro degradation equal to prodh <dig>  overexpression of a prodh2-gfp construct in arabidopsis was able to rescue the pro-hypersensitive phenotype of the pdh1- <dig> knockout mutant. we detected prodh2-gfp in the mitochondria and analysis of gus expression under control of the prodh <dig> promoter demonstrated specific expression in the vascular tissue and in the abscission zone of petals, sepals and stamina. in striking contrast to prodh <dig>  prodh <dig> expression was induced by salt stress and was absent in reproductive tissues.

RESULTS
at5g <dig> encodes a protein with prodh activity
reports on successful determination of prodh activity from plant mitochondrial membranes are very rare. a variety of papers ascribe a soluble activity of pro dependent nad+ reduction at ph  <dig>  to prodh, but this is more likely to be the reverse reaction of p5cr . therefore we choose to test the enzymatic function of the putative prodh <dig>  by heterologous expression in yeast. to obtain a suitable test system, we generated a mutant yeast strain in which the put <dig> gene, encoding the single prodh, was replaced by a kanamycin and geneticin resistance cassette by homologous recombination. the resulting geneticin resistant strain Δput <dig> was unable to catabolise pro as a source of nitrogen for growth . transformation of the Δput <dig> strain with a plasmid harbouring the full-length cdna of at5g <dig> did not enable the cells to metabolise pro. a similar observation for prodh <dig> has been described by kiyosue et al.  and was confirmed by our results  <cit> . exchange of the predicted mitochondrial transit peptide  of the putative prodh <dig>  against the mtp of the flavoprotein subunit of yeast succinate dehydrogenase  lead to the expression of a protein that rescued the pro metabolism defect of the Δput <dig> strain. also an exchange of the first  <dig> amino acid residues of prodh <dig> against the scsdh1-mtp enabled the expression of a functional protein. the scsdh1-mtp was chosen because it is unlikely to interfere with the functionality test for the arabidopsis prodhs. from these results we concluded that the name prodh <dig> was justified for at5g <dig>  under non-inducing conditions, with glucose instead of galactose as carbon source, none of the prodh <dig> or prodh <dig> expression constructs enabled the Δput <dig> strain to catabolise pro . expression of the full-length prodh <dig> cdna in wildtype yeast did not alter the growth properties and western blot analysis of cells expressing a prodh <dig> protein with 6×his-tag confirmed the presence of the recombinant protein . these findings indicate that the native prodh <dig> protein is not harmful to yeast, but does not have sufficient prodh activity to enable utilisation of pro as nitrogen source.

prodh <dig> is expressed specifically in the vascular tissue
the presence of two prodh genes in the arabidopsis genome, which both encode functional prodhs, raised the question of the specific function of prodh <dig>  expression analysis of prodh <dig> indicated ubiquitous expression in all organs, with the highest expression levels detected in pollen grains and in the stigma of the carpel  <cit> . to compare the expression of prodh <dig> and prodh <dig>  we fused  <dig> bp of upstream sequence of the prodh <dig> gene to a β-glucuronidase  gene. bioinformatic analysis of  <dig> bp of genomic sequence upstream of the start codon of prodh <dig> with the athena analysis tool did not reveal any potential transcription factor binding sites that were more abundant than the expectations for random distribution would predict  <cit> . however, consensus motifs for an abscisic acid responsive element and a drought responsive element were identified at - <dig> and - <dig> bp, respectively. most of the putative binding motifs that were found between - <dig> and - <dig> bp were also present in the region between - <dig> and - <dig> bp. therefore we chose to include only the region up to - <dig> bp in the gus-construct. transgenic plants harbouring this construct expressed gus activity exclusively in the vascular tissue . of the  <dig> analysed primary transformants, all showed a very similar expression pattern, albeit the amount of gus activity detected by x-gluc staining varied considerably . staining was generally weak in the youngest leaves and strongest in the older leaves. for further analysis, plants with intermediate activity in mature leaves were chosen. in inflorescences, the prodh2-promoter induced gus expression only in the abscission zone immediately below the pistils or siliques. this high expression persisted through silique maturation, demonstrating a partial spatial separation of prodh <dig> and prodh <dig> expression in flowers. northern blot analysis of rna isolated from various tissues of soil grown arabidopsis wildtype plants confirmed that the expression of prodh <dig> is stronger in floral organs . in young  and mature leaves , no prodh <dig> transcripts were detected, presumably due to the low relative content of vascular tissue, whereas a strong signal in senescent leaves  confirmed age-dependent regulation of prodh <dig> expression. in petioles from mature leaves, no prodh <dig> expression was detected by northern blot although this part of the leaf should be enriched in vascular tissue. also in roots and leaf-derived cell cultures, a strong expression of prodh <dig> was detected. in contrast, prodh <dig> was expressed also in a root-derived cell culture and was only slightly induced in senescent leaves. in the inflorescence, prodh <dig> expression reached its peak before prodh <dig>  p5cdh was detected in all organs analysed. however, a surprisingly low transcript level of p5cdh was observed in roots, where both prodh isoforms were strongly expressed.

prodh <dig> is induced by proline and salt but repressed by sugar
since the variation of gus activity between different transgenic lines was high, we used northern blot analysis to investigate the regulation of prodh <dig> expression. hanson et al.  identified prodh <dig> as a direct target of the transcription factor bzip <dig>  <cit> . in agreement with these findings, prodh <dig> transcript levels were higher when plants were incubated in medium without sucrose compared to treatment with  <dig> or  <dig> mm sucrose . also incubation for  <dig> h in medium containing  <dig> mm pro or  <dig> mm nacl in addition to  <dig> mm sucrose enhanced prodh <dig> expression slightly. these concentrations were found to be sub-lethal during the period of the treatment and effective in triggering changes in pro metabolism. induction of prodh <dig> by salt stress was surprising, since prodh <dig> is repressed under these conditions. induction of p5cs <dig> expression by  <dig> mm nacl demonstrated that the treatment was efficient in triggering pro accumulation. in general, the signals obtained for prodh <dig> were near the detection limit, while prodh <dig> detection yielded much stronger signals. this observation was confirmed by analysis of publicly available microarray data, in which prodh <dig> expression is frequently not clearly detected . for example, in the atgenexpress stress series, the maximal signal intensity for prodh <dig> is  <dig> -fold higher than for prodh <dig>  in the same dataset, the prodh <dig> expression pattern was more similar to p5cdh than to prodh <dig>  pathogen challenge and drought stress were among the rare cases, in which microarray analyses detected a stronger expression of prodh <dig> than of prodh <dig> 

we also analysed potential compensatory changes of prodh <dig> expression in the prodh <dig> knockout mutant pdh1- <dig>  <cit> . basal levels and sugar-dependent regulation of prodh <dig> were only mildly affected in the pdh1- <dig> mutant. induction of prodh <dig> by pro was slightly enhanced, presumably by the higher intracellular pro content caused by lack of the prodh <dig> isoform, which seems to be predominant in most tissues of wildtype plants. p5cs <dig> transcript levels were the same in wildtype and pdh1- <dig> mutant plants, while prodh <dig> transcripts were mostly undetectable in the mutant. under conditions of prodh <dig> induction, some aberrant transcripts were also detected in pdh1- <dig> 

a role of prodh <dig> in pro tolerance
the low and spatially limited expression of prodh <dig> posed the question of whether the prodh <dig> protein can make a significant contribution to pro metabolism. therefore we directly compared the pro sensitivity of pdh1- <dig>  pdh1- <dig>  and p5cdh- <dig> mutants, reasoning that pro degradation is completely blocked in p5cdh- <dig> mutants, while pdh <dig> mutants still contain the active prodh <dig> isoform. as described earlier, neither of these mutants was able to use  <dig> mm pro as the sole source of nitrogen . seedlings of both mutant genotypes did not expand properly and stayed etiolated, while wildtype seedlings turned green and developed true leaves. compared to col- <dig>  the ler ecotype showed a decreased ability to de-etiolate and grow with pro as the only nitrogen source. a transposon insertion mutant devoid of prodh <dig>  did not show increased sensitivity compared to the parental ler ecotype.

when pdh <dig> and p5cdh mutants were assayed for pro sensitivity in the presence of mineral nitrogen, only p5cdh- <dig> mutants showed a dose dependent inhibitory effect of pro on hypocotyl elongation  and fresh weight accumulation  that was different from the wildtype . these findings indicate that expression of prodh <dig> is not sufficient to compensate fully for the lack of prodh <dig>  but may still be able to confer limited pro tolerance in the presence of mineral nitrogen. contrary to the loss of prodh <dig> or p5cdh expression, loss of prodh <dig> did not result in pro hypersensitivity.

robust splicing of t-dnas in the first intron of prodh <dig> and prodh2
to enable a direct comparison of mutants completely devoid of prodh activity to the p5cdh- <dig> mutant, we screened the public t-dna insertion lines for pdh <dig> mutants. several lines  with t-dna insertions immediately upstream or downstream of the prodh <dig> coding sequence had little or no effect on transcript abundance . two lines were identified with a t-dna or a transposon in the first intron of prodh <dig> . by northern blot and rt-pcr analysis we were unable to detect native transcripts in homozygous gt <dig> plants, while both aberrant and a small amount of native transcripts were present in gabi_328g <dig> . therefore we termed these two insertion-lines pdh2- <dig> and pdh2- <dig>  respectively. histochemical analysis revealed no detectable gus activity in pdh2- <dig> plants, indicating that the gus gene of gene-trap construct contained in the transposon is not in frame with the first prodh <dig> exon after potential splicing events . a similar analysis of prodh <dig> insertion lines confirmed the absence of native transcripts in pdh1- <dig>  salk_ <dig>  and gabi_308f <dig> . in line salk_ <dig> , which carries an inverted tandem repeat of the t-dna in the first intron of prodh <dig>  a mixture of aberrant and native transcripts was detected, similar to the pdh2- <dig> insertion line. when grown under greenhouse conditions, all prodh <dig> or prodh <dig> insertion lines showed no phenotypic differences to the corresponding wildtypes . the production of useful pdh1/pdh <dig> double mutants is impeded by the fact that the insertion line pdh2- <dig> is in ler background, in which stress-responsive pro accumulation and pro sensitivity differs from col- <dig> . therefore, double mutants will have to be compared to multiple families of col-8/ler hybrids or crossed several times to one of the parental ecotypes.

prodh <dig> is localised to mitochondria
the reason for the inability of prodh <dig> mutants to utilise pro as nitrogen source, despite a functional prodh <dig> copy, could be that prodh <dig> is not in the correct subcellular localisation to support pro degradation. prediction programs clearly indicated a mitochondrial localisation, which we analysed with the help of transgenic plants expressing a prodh2-gfp fusion protein. the gfp signals obtained from such plants were much weaker compared to prodh1-gfp expression driven by the same promoter, but both prodh2-gfp and prodh1-gfp were clearly localised in mitochondria . subcellular localisation and enzymatic functionality of prodh <dig> indicated that the low expression level and/or the tissue specificity were responsible for the inability of pdh1- <dig> mutants to utilise pro as nitrogen source.

prodh2-gfp overexpression rescues the pdh1- <dig> mutant
to test the functional equivalence of prodh <dig> and prodh <dig>  also the pdh1- <dig> mutant was transformed with the constructs for the 35s-driven expression of prodh1-gfp and prodh2-gfp. overexpression of prodh2-gfp or prodh1-gfp restored the capability of pdh1- <dig> mutants to use pro as the sole source of nitrogen . these findings indicate that tissue specificity and expression levels are the main determinants of the different functionality of the two prodh isoforms in arabidopsis.

discussion
functional expression of arabidopsis prodhs in yeast
in the initial characterisation of prodh <dig>  two groups reported conflicting results concerning the expression of a functional protein from the native arabidopsis gene in yeast. the contra group circumvented the problem by using the mtp of the yeast prodh gene put <dig>  which might in itself interfere with the functionality test  <cit> . the data provided by the pro group lack proper positive and negative controls, for which it is impossible to tell if there is some strain specificity in the use of non-native mtps  <cit> . both studies suffer from the use of tryptophan auxotrophic strains, which necessitated the addition of low amounts of tryptophan, a potential nitrogen source. we circumvented these limitations by generating a Δput <dig> deletion strain in the 23344c background, which is wildtype except for the ura <dig> mutation that served as a selection marker for the expression plasmids. in this background, the native cdnas of either prodh gene from arabidopsis did not confer sufficient prodh activity to enable pro utilisation. exchange of the predicted mtps for the n-terminus of a metabolically unrelated mitochondrial protein from yeast allowed the expression of functional prodhs as evidenced by complementation of the pro utilisation defect of the Δput <dig> strain. from this we concluded that both prodh genes from arabidopsis encode proteins that mediate pro catabolism to p5c/gsa. functional expression of the hybrid genes in yeast indicated that protein folding and co-factor insertion of the arabidopsis proteins worked correctly in the heterologous system. mitochondrial localisation of prodh1-gfp and prodh2-gfp fusion proteins in arabidopsis demonstrated functionality of the prodh-mtps in the native organism. complementation of the pro hypersensitive phenotype of arabidopsis pdh1- <dig> mutant by overexpression of prodh1-gfp or prodh2-gfp provided further evidence that both proteins have the same enzymatic activity. it remains to be investigated, why the native arabidopsis prodh genes do not enable the expression of sufficient amounts of active and correctly targeted protein, whereas the arabidopsis p5cdh gene produced a functional protein with its native mtp  <cit> .

spatial, temporal and metabolic regulation of prodh <dig> expression
analysis of the tissue specificity of prodh <dig> expression by promoter-gus fusion demonstrated that prodh <dig> expression is restricted to the vascular tissue. this finding is in agreement with regulation of prodh <dig> expression by the transcription factor bzip <dig>  which is also spatially confined to the vasculature  <cit> . translation of bzip <dig> is repressed by sucrose, which resulted in reduced transcript levels of prodh <dig> in the presence of high sucrose concentrations. high sucrose concentrations  might also be the reason for the absence of prodh <dig> transcripts in the root-derived heterotrophic cell culture. the medium of the mixotrophic leaf-derived cell culture contained 1% sucrose , which is not sufficient to switch off prodh <dig> expression. prodh2-promoter driven gus expression increased with leaf age and was strongest in the abscission zone of the floral organs, indicating that developmental signals also play a role in prodh <dig> regulation. prodh <dig>  which had also enhanced promoter activity in the abscission zone, was additionally strongly expressed in pollen, in the stigma and in developing embryos, where no prodh <dig> expression was detected  <cit> . in roots, both prodh <dig> and prodh <dig> were strongly detected, while p5cdh was only weakly expressed. potentially, arginine catabolism, which is the second task of p5cdh, is less prominent in roots. alternatively, the strong prodh expression could result from the preparation of the roots by extensive washing in  tap water. expression changes of prodh <dig> are reportedly very fast, while regulation of p5cdh was slower  <cit> . increased prodh <dig> expression in old leaves was confirmed by northern blot analysis and evaluation of publicly available microarray data  <cit> . the spatial expression pattern was the most striking difference between prodh <dig> and prodh <dig> expression but also nacl treatment caused down-regulation only of prodh <dig>  similarly, ribarits et al.  found a differential regulation of two prodh isoforms during dehydration in tobacco, while under these conditions the arabidopsis prodhs were co-regulated  <cit> . over the broad range of different treatments documented in the microarray data collection, co-regulation of prodh <dig> and prodh <dig> is only sparsely observed, supporting our findings that the two prodh isoforms fulfil at least partially different physiological functions. up-regulation of prodh <dig> expression during salt or drought stress might indicate a special need for proline degradation in the vasculature, while down-regulation of prodh <dig> occurs in the remaining tissues and enables proline accumulation. these findings imply that proline accumulation might not be favourable in the vascular tissue and the continued degradation of proline may provide energy and glutamate for other metabolic pathways or for long distance transport.

prodh <dig> cannot fully compensate the lack of prodh1
loss-of-function mutants of prodh <dig> were identified and characterised as sensitive to external pro supply and heat treatment  <cit> . the existence and potential activity of prodh <dig> was neglected in these studies. mutants in p5cdh, which is a single copy gene in arabidopsis, were completely unable to degrade pro  <cit> . in a direct comparison of pdh <dig>  pdh <dig> and p5cdh mutants, we observed that pdh <dig> and p5cdh mutants were unable to utilise pro as the sole nitrogen source, whereas pdh <dig> mutants grew equally well as the corresponding wildtype. when pdh1- <dig>  pdh1- <dig> and p5cdh- <dig> mutants were grown on medium containing mineral nitrogen, only p5cdh- <dig> was more sensitive to growth-inhibition by external pro than the wildtype. preliminary characterisation of the pdh2- <dig> mutant showed a slightly enhanced pro accumulation in response to salt stress but not after external pro application . pro sensitivity and stress induced pro accumulation differed between the col- <dig> and ler wildtypes, confirming that a useful double mutant can only be produced after extensive backcrossing. from these data we conclude that the slightly enhanced prodh <dig> expression in pro treated pdh <dig> mutants could not fully compensate the loss of prodh <dig>  while it may be able to diminish the toxic effects of pro. alternatively, the toxic effects of pro supply might result from p5c, which is only expected to accumulate in the p5cdh- <dig> mutant. recent results presented by miller et al.  suggest that ros production by prodh rather than p5c accumulation is the cause of the toxic effects of pro application  <cit> . unfortunately, miller et al.  did not analyse prodh mutants and from the data presented it is not possible to determine, whether ros production is the cause or a consequence of the loss of mitochondrial integrity that was observed in earlier studies  <cit> . our identification of pdh <dig> mutants and the possibility to generate double mutants completely devoid of prodh activity opens new possibilities to dissect the contribution of pro degradation to pro toxicity and stress tolerance. the detailed characterisation of the pdh <dig> mutants will also help to identify the specific physiological function of prodh <dig> in the vascular tissue.

CONCLUSIONS
despite numerous biochemical and molecular approaches, the protective mechanism of pro accumulation remains unclear. each new piece of experimental evidence added to our picture of pro metabolism in plants requires careful re-interpretation of previous results. only by a thorough analysis of all components and also non-obvious side effects it will become possible to understand the seemingly dual nature of pro as a protective and toxic compound. the functional characterisation of prodh <dig> opens up a whole new set of experimental approaches to understand the function of pro in the stress tolerance of plants.
