BACKGROUND
enterococcus faecium is a common enterococcal species increasingly isolated from hospital-associated infections in the usa  <cit> . compelling evidence suggests that this substantial increase in e. faecium nosocomial infections is due to the worldwide occurrence of a genetic subcluster  which encompasses clones that appear to have evolved independently  <cit> . several genes have been associated with cc <dig> e. faecium including i) espefm, encoding a surface protein which has been associated with increased biofilm formation and urinary tract infection   <cit> ; ii) some fms genes , encoding putative microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules  or components of enterococcal pili   <cit> ; iii) an intact acm gene encoding a collagen adhesin which was shown to be important in the pathogenesis of endocarditis  <cit>  and, iv) plasmids carrying the hylefm gene  <cit> .

it has been previously shown that hylefm is carried by large transferable megaplasmids of different sizes  in hospital-associated e. faecium which are widely distributed worldwide  <cit>  these plasmids also can harbour antibiotic resistance determinants and some pilus-encoding genes of e. faecium which are present with hylefm in the same plasmid  <cit> . the acquisition of the hylefm-plasmid by an e. faecium laboratory strain  from a us clinical isolate  increased the colonization of the gastrointestinal tract of mice, an effect that was independent of the presence of antibiotic resistance determinants  <cit> . moreover, the acquisition of the hylefm-plasmid from another us clinical strain  increased the virulence of a commensal strain e. faecium tx1330rf in experimental peritonitis  <cit> .

the hylefm protein was initially predicted to have homology with hyaluronidases which have been associated with virulence in other gram-positive pathogens  <cit> , although hyaluronidase activity has not been detected in e. faecium isolates carrying this gene  <cit> . the most recent annotation and sequence comparisons indicate that this protein is likely to encode a family  <dig> glycosyl hydrolase  <cit> . in fact, the homolog of hylefm in streptococcus pyogenes  encoded in a genetic locus with a similar organization to that of the hylefm-region and sharing 42% identity at the amino acid level , was recently shown not to have any detectable hyaluronidase activity. spy <dig> was characterized as a family  <dig> glycosyl hydrolase with β-n-acetyl-glucosaminidase specificity after purification and substrate analysis  <cit>  and expression of spy <dig> in s. pyogenes was found to be up-regulated during phagocytosis  <cit> . for this reason, and because of the almost exclusive occurrence of hylefm in isolates from clinical origin in different surveillance studies  <cit> , this gene has been postulated as an important pathogenic determinant of hospital-associated e. faecium. however, its exact role in virulence has not been established. in this work, we assess the role of the hylefm-region in e. faecium pathogenesis of experimental peritonitis.

construction of a deletion mutant of the hylefm-region using the phes* counter-selection system in tx <dig> and its transfer to tx1330rf
the phes* system   <cit>  is based on the acquired sensitivity of bacteria to p-chloro-phenylalanine  if they carry a phes* allele encoding a phenylalanine trna synthetase with altered substrate specificity  <cit> . in order to apply this approach to e. faecium strains, which are commonly macrolide resistant, we constructed a derivative of the phes* vector pcjk <dig> by replacing its erm gene with aph2"-id, which confers resistance to gentamicin. the full aph-2"-id gene  was amplified by pcr using plasmid ptex5501ts  <cit>  as the template with primers a and b . the amplified fragment  was digested with nsii and bglii and ligated with pcjk <dig> digested with the same enzymes resulting in phou <dig> . subsequently, phou <dig> was digested with bamhi and psti and ligated with a  <dig> bp fragment released from ptex5501ts after digestion with the same enzymes and containing the chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase gene , obtaining a  <dig>  bp vector designated phou <dig> .

in order to create a deletion mutant of the hylefm-region , fragments upstream  and downstream  of this region were amplified by pcr  and cloned upstream and downstream of the cat gene in phou <dig>  respectively, using bamhi and xhoi for the upstream fragment and apai and ecori for the downstream fragment; the correct insert was confirmed by sequencing in both directions. this recombinant plasmid was introduced into e. faecalis ck <dig> by electroporation as described previously  <cit>  and blue colonies were recovered on brain heart infusion  agar plates containing gentamicin  and x-gal . subsequently, the phou <dig> derivatives were introduced into strain tx <dig> by filter mating  <cit>  with e. faecalis ck <dig> as the donor. single cross-over integrants were selected on gentamicin  and erythromycin  and purified colonies were then resuspended in  <dig> μl of normal saline and plated on mm9yeg media  supplemented with  <dig> mm of p-cl-phe  <cit>  and incubated for  <dig> h at 37°c. to confirm that colonies which grew on mm9yeg media supplemented with p-cl-phe were excisants, the corresponding colonies were grown simultaneously on bhi agar in the presence and absence of gentamicin. colonies that were susceptible to gentamicin were further screened by pcr, pulsed field gel electrophoresis  and hybridizations with hylefm and cat probes as described before  <cit> . the mutated region was also sequenced in order to confirm deletion of the corresponding genes. subsequently, the mutated hylefm-containing plasmid  was transferred from e. faecium tx <dig> to tx1330rf  by filter mating as described previously  <cit>  to obtain the strain tx1330rf. acquisition of the mutated plasmid by tx1330rf was also confirmed by pfge, pcr, hybridizations and sequencing. s <dig> nuclease digestion and pfge was performed with the mutant to confirm that no other plasmid had transferred during the conjugation event as previously described  <cit> .

complementation of the hylefm-region mutant tx1330rf
the hylefm gene was pcr amplified with primers g and h   using total dna from tx <dig> as template, and the dna fragment  cloned into the shuttle plasmid pat <dig>  <cit>  under the control of the p <dig> promoter  and upstream of the aac-aph gene  using saci and smai sites . in order to evaluate if the deletion of hylefm had an effect in the downstream gene , the hylefm and down genes  were also cloned together into pat <dig> following a similar strategy and using primers g and i . recombinant pat392-derivatives were purified from e. coli grown on luria-bertani agar containing gentamicin  and all their dna inserts sequenced. subsequently, they were introduced into e. faecium tx1330rf, and the tx1330rf mutant by electroporation. stability of the plasmid constructs was tested by isolating ca.  <dig> colonies from overnight cultures  and from the spleens of dead animals  after intraperitoneal inoculation of the corresponding strain  and plating them simultaneously on bhi and bhi-gentamicin .

construction of additional mutants of the hylefm-region in e. faecium tx1330rf
to investigate the specific role of the hylefm locus in e. faecium pathogenesis, complete in-frame deletions of four genes of the hylefm-region, hylefm alone, hylefm plus its downstream gene and the gene downstream of hylefm were generated using tx1330rf. fragments upstream and downstream of each region were amplified by pcr with the corresponding primers . these fragments, with overlapping ends, were subsequently amplified by crossover pcr and cloned into phou <dig> using ecori and noti ; and bamhi and psti . the inserts were sequenced in both directions to confirm that no mutations had been introduced during the cloning process. the recombinant plasmids were electroporated or transferred by conjugation  into tx1330rf. single crossover events and deletions of targeted regions  were obtained by plating in bhi with gentamicin and p-cl-phe containing medium, respectively, as previously described  <cit> . confirmation of the deletion was performed by pcr, pfge, hybridizations and dna sequencing.

rt-pcr
rna was extracted from bacterial cells , tx1330rf and strains containing pat <dig> derivatives) grown in bhi broth at 37°c with mild agitation  as described before  <cit> , and using the rna isolation kit rnawiz . rna was treated twice with dnase  and synthesis of cdna was performed using the commercial kit superscript one-step reverse transcription-pcr  with platinum taq , according to the manufacturer's instructions. the mixture contained  <dig>  μm of each primer, designed to detect overlapping transcripts of the four putative metabolic genes  and an internal transcript of hylefm . a primer pair directed to detect a 550-bp transcript of the housekeeping gene ddle. faecium was used as an internal control for rt-pcr experiments  <cit> .

mouse peritonitis model
female , outbred icr mice  were used as previously described  <cit> . groups of  <dig> mice per inoculum  were included in each experiment. inocula for each peritonitis experiment were prepared by growing bacteria initially on bhi agar plates. subsequently, one colony was grown in bhi broth for  <dig> h at 37°c and the cells were concentrated in saline  to an a <dig> of ca.  <dig> . strains containing pat <dig> and derivatives were handled similarly before the intraperitoneal inoculation, except that the bhi agar and broth contained gentamicin . comparison of the survival curves at similar inocula was performed using a log-rank test with prism for windows®. a p <  <dig>  was considered significant. all experiments were approved by the animal welfare committee, university of texas health science center at houston.

RESULTS
deletion of  <dig> genes in the e. faecium hylefm-region altered in vitro growth and attenuated virulence of tx1330rf but not tx <dig> in murine peritonitis
since acquisition of the transferable phylefmtx <dig> by tx1330rf conferred increased virulence in experimental peritonitis  <cit> , we explored the possibility that the hylefm region was an important mediator of this effect. using rt-pcr assays, we were able to detect in vitro expression of hylefm during the exponential phase of growth in both tx <dig> and tx1330rf  . rt-pcr with primers located at the 3' and 5' ends of contiguous genes yielded products of the expected size in each case, suggesting that these genes are likely to be co-transcribed . then, we adapted the phes* counter-selection system  <cit>  developed for e. faecalis to obtain several deletions of the hylefm-region. the hylefm gene in e. faecium tx <dig>  is located in a cluster of genes whose putative function appears to involve the transport and breakdown of carbohydrates   <cit> . as an initial step to test the mutagenesis system, a relatively large deletion  from phylefmtx <dig> was obtained. the deletion involved three genes predicted to encode glycosyl hydrolases  and a gene downstream of hylefm whose function is unknown . part  of a gene encoding a hypothetical transmembrane protein and located upstream of the putative family  <dig> glycosyl hydrolase gene and part  of a gene located  <dig>  nt downstream of hylefm encoding a putative gmp-synthase and likely transcribed in the opposite direction from the hylefm cluster  were also deleted. as it is shown in figure 4a, the deletion of  <dig>  bp in the hylefm-region did not affect the virulence of tx <dig>  in murine peritonitis.

next, we considered the possibility that an in vivo effect might be more clearly dissected if studies were performed in the background of a non-clinical strain. we hypothesized that an in vivo effect of a virulence determinant might more likely be seen in strains which are less successful clinically; that is, that a commensal strain such as tx1330rf  <cit>  is likely to have decreased fitness or ability to produce disease compared to tx <dig>  <cit>  and, thus, acquisition plus subsequent loss of a virulence determinant that alters such fitness would be easier to identify  <cit> . thus, the mutated plasmid from strain tx <dig> was transferred to tx1330rf by conjugation and the in vivo effect of acquiring the intact plasmid  <cit>  vs the plasmid carrying the deletion was evaluated. the two strains  appeared to differ only in the size of the hylefm plasmid by pfge and s <dig> nuclease assays  <cit>  . figure 4b shows that deletion of  <dig>  bp in the hylefm region of tx1330rf caused an in vitro growth defect. the alteration of growth was also seen in a second transconjugant from the same mating experiment between tx <dig> and tx1330rf . the mutant strain tx1330rf was attenuated in the mouse model of peritonitis   . due to the alterations produced in the growth of tx1330rf, these results suggest that the attenuation in virulence may have also been due to factors other than those specifically related to virulence.

complementation of the hylefm-region mutant with hylefm and a combination of hylefm and the downstream gene did not restore the virulence of tx1330rf
in order to further evaluate if the attenuation observed in tx1330rf  was mediated by a direct effect of hylefm in the peritonitis model, we explored complementation of this mutant in trans with the full hylefm gene and a combination of hylefm and the downstream gene using the shuttle vector pat <dig>  <cit> . the cloning strategy placed these genes upstream of the aac-aph gene  resulting in all open reading frames under the control of the constitutive p <dig> promoter. up to 80% loss was observed with all strains in the absence of gentamicin; however, in the presence of the antibiotic during inoculum preparation, the tx1330rf-derivatives containing the pat <dig> constructs were stable both in vitro and in vivo . introduction of hylefm or a combination of hylefm plus its downstream gene  did not restore the virulence of the mutant strain tx1330rf, compared to pat <dig> alone in the presence of gentamicin . the results indicate that constitutive expression of hylefm alone or in combination with its downstream gene  was not able to restore the phenotypic differences observed in the mutant strain tx1330rf, supporting the fact that hylefm may not be directly responsible of the attenuation observed in the mutant.

under our experimental conditions, we cannot completely rule out that the in vivo attenuation observed with phylefmtx16Δ <dig>  in the tx1330rf background may have been caused by the partial deletion of the hypothetical transmembrane protein or the putative gmp-synthase located upstream and downstream of the hylefm-cluster, respectively. indeed, a deletion of  <dig> amino acids in the c-terminus of the hypothetical membrane protein occurred in this plasmid, resulting in the deletion of three predicted transmembrane helices. similarly,  <dig> amino acids in the c-terminus of the putative gmp-synthase were deleted; the removal of these amino acids is likely to disturb the dimerization domain of this protein  <cit>  affecting its function in nucleotide metabolism. moreover, a second tx1330rf mutant also exhibited an almost identical growth defect . thus, it is tempting to speculate that changes in these two genes may have affected the "metabolic" fitness of the tx1330rf strain. however, since no evident change in fitness or virulence was observed with the mutated plasmid in the tx <dig> background, another possibility is that an extraneous change elsewhere in the plasmid  occurred during the conjugation process that influenced the in vitro growth of the tx1330rf mutant and its virulence.

additional deletions of genes in the hylefm-region did not alter the virulence of tx1330rf in the mouse peritonitis model
in order to dissect further the in vivo role of hylefm and the adjacent genes, we produced several in-frame deletions of these genes  including: i) a four gene mutant of the hylefm-region  , ii) a deletion of hylefm alone , iii) a deletion of hylefm plus its downstream gene mutant  and, iv) a single deletion of the gene located downstream from hylefm . the mutagenesis strategy removed the open reading frame from the start codon of the first gene to the stop codon of the last gene . in case of single gene deletion, the complete orf  was removed, leaving the surrounding dna intact as in the wild type plasmid. none of the four mutants of the hylefm-region showed a deleterious effect in the growth kinetics compared to tx1330rf  . moreover, we were unable to observe any attenuation of virulence in the mouse peritonitis model compared to the parental strain with the intact plasmid , which further supports the fact that the four genes of the hylefm region do not appear to be directly involved in increasing the pathogenic potential of phylefmtx <dig> in strain tx1330rf.

megaplasmids  have been recently found to be widespread among clinical isolates of e. faecium worldwide  <cit> . the proportion of these plasmids carrying hylefm appears to vary according to geographical location   <cit> . our findings indicate that the four genes of the hylefm-cluster studied here, including hylefm are not the main mediators of the virulence effect conferred by the plasmid carrying them in experimental peritonitis. since the phylefm plasmids are large, it is presumed that other genes  are more relevant in mediating this effect. additionally, we cannot exclude that the hylefm cluster studied in this work may play a role in other infections such as endocarditis or urinary tract infections . as a final remark, the adaptation of the phes* counter-selection system for targeted mutagenesis in plasmid and chromosomal genes of e. faecium will facilitate the understanding of the role of other specific plasmid genes in the pathogenesis of e. faecium infections in the near future.

CONCLUSIONS
we provided evidence that four genes of the hylefm-region  do not mediate the virulence effect of the e. faecium plasmid phylefm in experimental peritonitis. the adaptation of the phes* counter-selection system for targeted mutagenesis of e. faecium should facilitate the study of the role of other phylefm genes in the pathogenesis of murine peritonitis.
