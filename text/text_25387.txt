BACKGROUND
acinetobacter baumannii is a nonfermentative, nonmotile, catalase-positive, gram-negative bacterium found in soil, water, sewage, and many health care environments. a. baumannii is also a commensal microbe existing on human skin and mucous membrane, capable of opportunistic infections, especially in immunocompromised individuals, including pneumonia, meningitis, septicaemia, and urinary tract infection  <cit> . since its first discovery, a. baumannii has become resistant to many common antibiotics due to both intrinsic mechanisms and its capability to acquire drug resistance determinants. the increasing prevalence of multi-drug and pan-drug resistant a. baumannii strains found in clinics has rendered it one of the few important nosocomial pathogens, only next to pseudomonas aeruginosa among non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . a. baumannii is resistant to dehydration, uv radiation, common chemical sanitizers, and detergents, making it extremely difficult to eradicate a. baumannii contaminations from hospital settings, especially catheter-related devices used in intensive care units . in fact, regular antimicrobial agents only inhibit its growth. currently, there are no procedures available for removing a. baumannii in hospital environments, greatly increasing the risk of hospitalized patients, especially patients in icu, to the infection by antibiotic-resistant a. baumannii  <cit> .

recently, there have been renewed interests in the researches and applications of bacteriophages as antibacterial agent, partly due to their specificity in targeting and lysing host bacteria  <cit> . discovered over one hundred years ago, bacteriophages have been successfully used in the treatments of various infectious diseases. as an alternative to antibiotic therapy, bacteriophage therapy is potentially a powerful approach for the treatment of bacterial infection, especially when antibiotic resistance is increasingly becoming a serious challenge facing the medical community  <cit> . recently, bacteriophage preparations have been approved by the food and drug administration of usa as a food additive in ready-to-eat products to prevent foodborne bacterial diseases  <cit> . animal tests of phage therapy are being conducted for treatments of various bacteria infections, and many lytic phages have been isolated and tested for such applications  <cit> .

phages specific to acinetobacter genus were isolated and subsequently used in phage-typing of acinetobacter spp. isolates  <cit> . using an animal model, soothill examined phage efficacy against infections caused by a. baumannii. specifically, tested mice survived the otherwise lethal challenge of  <dig> ld <dig>  cells of a virulent a. baumannii strain, when protected by as few as  <dig> pfu of one lytic acinetobacter phage  <cit> . however, to our best knowledge, no detailed characterizations on any lytic a. baumannii phages have been reported  <cit> . in this paper, clinical isolates of a. baumannii were collected and used as indicator hosts for screening phages in marine sediment sample. virulent phage ab <dig> was isolated and characterized. the results showed phage ab <dig> as a double-stranded dna bacterial virus capable of efficiently lysing a. baumannii kd <dig> 

RESULTS
identification of a. baumannii clinical strains
before starting phage screening, clinically isolated acinetobacter spp. strains were first confirmed the identity of the a. baumannii by using sequence information derived from their 16s rrna gene. as described in material and methods, dna fragment containing 16s rrna gene from each clinical isolate was pcr-amplified and sequenced. the resulted sequences were deposited to genbank and aligned to search for the most similar sequences. five collected clinical strains  were validated to be a. baumannii and kd <dig> was stenotrophomonas maltophilia, one pathogen often isolated accompanying with a. baumannii infections.

bacteriophage isolation
five a. baumannii clinical isolates were used as indicator strains for virulent bacteriophages screening from marine sediment samples. after enrichment, phage-containing samples were plated onto semi-solid agar plates with the indicator strain forming a bacterial lawn, and plaques were allowed to form by incubating at 35°c for  <dig> hours. clear plaques were obtained from these samples only when strain kd <dig> served as the indicator, with plaques forming at size of about 1- <dig> mm in diameter. the phage isolate  was selected for further study.

restriction fragment analysis of genomic dna
phage ab <dig> was amplified and its genomic dna extracted as described. purified genomic dna was digested with several restriction endonucleases or their combiantions, including apai, bamhi, bglii, ecori, ecorv, hindiii, kpni, ncoi, psti, pvuii, sali, sphi, xbai, bglii/xbai, ecori/bglii, and ecori/xbai, and subsequently subjected to electrophoretic analyses. as shown in fig.  <dig>  out of the tested enzymes, the enzyme combinations generated clear dna patterns. based on the digestion profiles of bglii/xbai, ecori/bglii, and ecori/xbai, the genome size was determined to be approximately at the range of  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb. the restriction analyses also indicated that phage ab <dig> was a dsdna virus. determination of the phage genome sequence is also underway.

morphology study by transmission electron microscopy
phage ab <dig> solution was filtrated with amicon- <dig> filter to remove soluble macromolecules up to  <dig> kd in size. after washing three times with  <dig>  m ammonium acetate solution, the retained phage solution was used directly for negative staining. images of phage ab <dig> were developed using transmission electron microscope . the results showed that phage ab <dig> had an icosahedral head, about  <dig> nm in diameter, a  <dig> nm long non-contractile tail, and collar or whisker structures, thus morphologically similar to phages belonging to siphoviridae family.

proteomic analysis of phage structural proteins
purified phage particles were subjected to sds-page and proteomic patterns were obtained after coomassie blue g- <dig> staining and destaining . totally, five major protein bands and six minor protein bands were observed on the gel, with molecular weights ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kilo-dalton.

determination of the multiplicity of infection 
a. baumannii culture of exponential growth phase was aliquot into vials with equal number of bacterial cells , which were infected with different amount of phage ab <dig> as designed, then plated after  <dig> hours of incubation. the group with a moi of 10- <dig> gave the highest production of phage progeny , and the moi of 10- <dig> was chosen for the subsequent experiments in this study.

analysis of calcium effect on adsorption rate
adsorption was the first step of phage infection of host bacteria and is often affected by the presence of divalent metal ions in the solution  <cit> . in the experiments, calcium ions were added to test their effects on adsorption efficacy. phage ab <dig> and a. baumannii cells were mixed, free phage numbers, left in the solution, were detected at different time intervals. statistical analysis showed significant differences existed between the two groups, and the results indicated calcium ions might stabilize phage adsorption process .

latent time and phage burst size
single step growth experiment was performed to determine the latent time and phage burst size of phage ab <dig>  as shown in fig.  <dig>  a triphasic curve, including the latent phase, rise phase, and plateau phase, was obtained. using these data, the latent time was determined to be about  <dig> minutes, and the burst size of phage ab <dig> was  <dig> pfu/infected cell.

ph and thermal stability tests
optimal ph was determined by testing the stability of phage ab <dig> under different phs. almost no reduction of infectious phage ab <dig> was observed after one hour incubation at ph <dig> , while different reduction percentages were obtained at other phs, only  <dig> % recovery of infectious phage ab <dig> at ph <dig> . these results suggested that extreme phs might affect phage ab <dig> stability .

thermal stability test was carried out to analyze heat resistant capability of phage ab <dig> at ph <dig> . the preliminary experiments showed that phage ab <dig> stock solution retained almost 100% infection activity after incubation at 37°c for one month , so higher temperatures of 50°c, 60°c, 70°c, 80°c, and 90°c were chosen to test thermal stability of phage ab <dig> . the results showed phage ab <dig> was extremely heat stable,  <dig> % and  <dig> % phages still remained alive after  <dig> minutes incubation at 50°c and 60°c, respectively; only  <dig> % phages were alive after  <dig> minutes incubation at 70°c; while more than 99% phages lost their infection ability in  <dig> minutes at 80°c, or  <dig> minutes at 90°c.

host range
the susceptibility to phage ab <dig> was also investigated with four other clinical strains of a. baumannii, one clinical strain of stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and other lab bacteria strains such as pseudomonas aeruginosa pak and pao <dig>  no strain tested was found susceptible to phage ab <dig>  the results indicated phage ab <dig> had a narrow host range, consistent with the previous discoveries  <cit> . phages specifically targeting acinetobacter spp. have narrow host ranges, usually one host one phage, and it's probably due to the existence of abundant surface bacterial antigens on this bacterium. these antigens are sufficient for different phage recognition  <cit> .

the susceptibility test
recently, most clinical isolates of a. baunannii were found to be resistant to many antibiotics still in use, making difficult the choice of an adequate antibiotic for the treatment of a. baunannii infections  <cit> . in our study, in vitro susceptibility tests of the  <dig> clinical strains were carried out . among the  <dig> antibiotics tested, all strains were resistant to amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, cephalothin, and nitrofurantoin. strain kd <dig> was only susceptible to  <dig> antibiotics, resistant to  <dig> others including imipenem. strain kd <dig>  the host of phage ab <dig>  was susceptible to only  <dig> antibiotics including imipenem but resistant to gentamicin, differing from all other clinical isolates. all these data was coincident with the prevalence of multi-drug resistant a. baunannii infections throughout the world, indicating urgent statue of new drugs discovery.

discussion
most classified acinetobacter phages are tailed viruses with double stranded dna genomes. they are classified into three families of the order of caudovirales, including myoviridae, podoviridae, and siphoviridae  <cit> . one exception is phage ap <dig> which is a ssrna virus propagating in acinetobacter species  <cit> . it belongs to leviviridae family and tentatively classified into levivius genus. in this study, phage ab <dig> had an icosahedral head with a non-contractile tail, and its genome was a molecule of double stranded dna, so it was tentatively classified as a member of siphoviridae family. moreover, collar or whisker structures were also observed in the phage ab <dig> . similar complexes have been found in escherichia coli phage t <dig>  <cit>  and lactic acid bacteria phages  <cit> . these structures are involved in phage assembly, possible regulation functions, sensing environmental conditions, and holding long tail fibers in a retracted conformation  <cit> .

thermal resistant phages were usually isolated from extreme thermal habits  <cit> , but they could also be found in other environments. recently, thermal resistant phages have been isolated and characterized from various dairy products  <cit> . our experiment results showed that phage ab <dig> was quite heat resistant,  <dig> % phages  were still infectious even after  <dig> min incubation at 90°c . in the preliminary experiments, phage amplification lysate  was heated directly at 100°c for stability test. after  <dig> minutes boiling, the alive phage concentration was still about 105- <dig> pfu/ml . previous studies showed that media components of phage solution could affect the thermal stability of phage  <cit> . for phage ab <dig>  the lysate supernatant of phage amplification was used directly in thermal stability tests without any additional substance added to lb medium. to demonstrate the mechanism of its notable thermal resistance, more experiments need to be done.

nowadays, phage therapy has regained much attention due to the emergence of drug resistant pathogens and the dearth of new antibiotics in pipeline. in this study, phage ab <dig> specific to a. baumannii was isolated and characterized. the virus had some outstanding aspects including rapid growth nature, high ph stability, and high thermal resistance. all these characters made this phage very promised for possible applications in eradication of a. baumannii contaminations and or treatment of a. baumannii infections. however, there was a great diversity of surface antigens existed among the isolated clinical a. baumannii strains  <cit>  and individual phage like ab <dig> with narrow host range was not suitable to be used directly  <cit> . in the future, more phages need to be isolated for preparations of cocktails which might be the best choice for phage applications.

CONCLUSIONS
characterization of phage ab <dig> showed that it was very efficient in lysing a. baunannii, combined with its outstanding thermal stability, it may be a good candidate to be used as an alternative nontoxic green sanitizer. however, host range tests showed phage ab <dig> did not infect other a. baunannii clinical strains included in this study, suggesting that more virulent bacteriophages specific to different a. baunannii strains need to be screened and collected in future. a pool of lytic phages might be more useful against a. baunannii strains for possible phage applications.
