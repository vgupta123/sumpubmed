BACKGROUND
animal studies are performed in controlled environments, and provide an acceptable compromise for studying events that occur in human beings, providing clues for understanding when and where such events originally occur. for example, sufficient technological progress has now been achieved to make it possible to see, literally, when and where an acute kidney injury will induce patchy necrosis of tubular epithelial cells  <cit> . obtaining mechanistic insight into why and how this occurs is another similarly important challenge: new drug discovery implies the ability to distinguish between the molecular causes and the biological effects in specific cell types. in-vitro studies clearly provide an important technical complement here  <cit> . the biological relevance of what is observed in a culture dish is, however, very uncertain, because the study environment is even more restricted. furthermore, the cells are completely isolated from the source organ, as well as from the whole source animal. not to mention the fact that immortalizing a cell lineage, something routinely performed to save time and money, may profoundly alter cell programming and how it responds to injury.

ex-vivo study of the cell lysate of a whole organ subjected to some form of injury would obviously be uninformative, since it would mix many different cell types and could provide misleading observations or mask significant ones. another approach would be to examine the population of interest after the injury has been imposed in vivo . the limitations of this approach so far have been 1) the dissociation, using enzymes at 37°c, which can dramatically modify the cell phenotype   <cit> , and 2) the heterogeneity of the dissociated cell suspension which, as far as we know, was always cultured before being studied   <cit> .

here, we describe a fast, low-cost method that keeps the cells alive and does not necessitate costly equipment, that can be used to extract thousands of intact proximal tubular cells from one or a few fresh kidneys, making it possible to carry out ex vivo and extemporaneous quantification of multiple molecular pathways or cell-type specific selection for subsequent analysis or culture .figure  <dig>

RESULTS
instantaneous, enzyme-free preparation of a cellular suspension from whole kidneys
immediately after being harvested from adult c57bl6/j mice, each kidney was immersed in dissociating buffer, chopped and dissociated using the gentlemacs cell dissociator  for 2 minutes at 4°c, with no added enzymes. this protocol, which takes no more than 10 minutes total, is detailed in the methods section and in table  <dig> table  <dig> 
protocol for direct dissociation of a whole kidney into a cell suspension




debris exclusion prior to cell analysis
the suspension contained cells of various sizes and structures, plus many cellular fragments and aggregates that would prevent proper gating using the classical fsc/ssc  plot on a cytometer. it should be noted that debris resulting from mechanical dissociation of the kidney can lead to significant autofluorescence; this debris must be excluded in order to obtain a reliable and accurately quantitative signal. because debris does not contain chromatin, hoechst staining was used firstly to 1) detect dna  and to exclude non-cellular debris, and 2) among intact cells, select singlets using a peak versus area plot . autofluorescence preponderantly emits in the green channels, which is why we used the v <dig> signal to compensate for the v <dig> signal, further excluding autofluorescent debris. this further improved the quantification of dna cellular content, and made it possible to analyze the cell-cycle .figure  <dig>

ex-vivo analysis of proximal tubular cells in the whole kidney suspension
proximal tubular epithelial cells are highly differentiated renal cells. prominin- <dig> is a surface glycoprotein expressed in the brush border  <cit> . anti-prominin- <dig> antibodies are theoretically appropriate for use in that a) they are commercially available , b) they have been conjugated with a number of tags, and c) they target the extracellular region of prominin- <dig>  which makes it possible to work with live, unpermeabilized cells.

there are several isoforms of prominin- <dig>  and some anti-prominin- <dig> antibodies show clone-dependent specificities for renal epithelial cellular subtypes  <cit> . to confirm that prominin-1+ cells detected with clone mb9-3g <dig> were indeed proximal epithelial tubular cells, we measured its coexpression with megalin, a reliable marker of proximal tubules, by means of two different techniques. using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, we showed that prominin- <dig> and megalin colocalize . megalin and prominin- <dig> also colocalized after ischemia reperfusion injury .figure  <dig>

we studied the effect of ischemia reperfusion injury on the expression of prominin- <dig> and cd <dig>  in cells from dissociated kidneys. in control mice, prominin- <dig> was positive in  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the cells, and cd <dig> was expressed respectively in  <dig> % and  <dig> % of these prominin-1+ cells. at day  <dig> post ischemia reperfusion injury, prominin- <dig> was positive in  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the cells, and cd <dig> was expressed respectively in  <dig> % and  <dig> % of these prominin-1+ cells .figure  <dig>

isolation of proximal tubular cells from a whole kidney cell suspension
we reasoned that we could capture proximal tubular cells by using magnetic microbeads conjugated with an anti-prominin- <dig> antibody that specifically targets the proximal tubules; thus, a strong magnetic field applied to the preparation would separate the proximal tubular cells from the others. we therefore incubated the kidney cell suspension obtained as described above with microbead-conjugated anti-prominin- <dig> antibodies. allophycocyanin -conjugated anti-prominin- <dig> antibodies were also added to label prominin-1+ cells in order to check the quality of the magnetic separation by flow cytometry. we chose apc since its emission wavelenghth is barely affected by autofluorescence  <cit> , and because it doesn’t overlap with hoechst fluorescence spectrum.

the prominin- <dig> negative cells were eluted, and the prominin-1+ cells were flushed at the end of the procedure after the magnetic field had been lifted. this isolation protocol is detailed in table  <dig>  the percentage of prominin-1+ cells is assessed extemporaneously by flow cytometry . hundreds of thousand cells can be obtained per kidney. this yield may vary depending on experimental conditions . assessed by flow cytometry, the purity of prominin- <dig> cells in the positive fraction was  <dig>  ±  <dig> %. to further verify the specificity of the enrichment in proximal tubular cells, we used real-time pcr to compare the quantity of cell-type specific transcripts . we confirmed by rt-qpcr that the enriched fraction was indeed significantly enriched in prominin- <dig> mrna compared to the eluted fraction . cd <dig> and aqp <dig> mrnas expression was very low in the enriched and the eluted fraction .table  <dig>

cellular culture of a specific cell type isolated from a whole kidney cell suspension
prominin-1+ cells proved suitable for primary culture. after a period of proliferation, cells became contiguous and re-acquired an epithelial phenotype. using contrast-phase microscopy, we observed a monolayer of polygonal, contiguous cells . a component of epithelial tight junctions, the transmembrane protein zona occludens  <dig>  is a marker of differentiated epithelia. zo- <dig> was found to be expressed in prominin-1+ cells . the cells expressed mrnas of prominin- <dig> and megalin, and ctgf, but not of cd <dig> or collagen  <dig> . when exposed to tgf-ß, collagen  <dig> and ctgf mrnas were induced and megalin mrna was down-regulated , whereas prominin- <dig> mrna remained stable. these phenotypic changes are typical of the effect of tgf-ß on epithelial cells, and these data suggest that prominin- <dig> expression remains stable at least in the first steps of epithelial injury .figure  <dig>

discussion
our method can be used to analyze and separate distinct cell types from an organ  during in vivo experiments. it yields operator-independent, quantitative and multi-parameter data on specific cell types. this resolves the issues of the irrelevance of cell cultures to investigate organ pathology and the cell heterogeneity characteristic of in vivo studies using whole organ lysates, which makes them unsuitable for proteomics or molecular biology.

other approaches had been used previously: laser micro-dissection on frozen or fixed tissues  <cit> ; primary culture obtained by enzymatic kidney dissociation followed by facs  <cit> ; and, more recently, translating ribosome affinity purification   <cit> .

although these techniques can be useful, they all have some major drawbacks: 1) laser microdissection can only be applied to dead cells  and cannot finely differentiate between cellular subtypes ; 2) enzymatic dissociation/facs implies a long and aggressive step of dissociation at 37°c when massive changes can occur within the cells  <cit> , biasing any subsequent analysis; in addition, cell sorters are onerous equipment which are not suitable for benchtop use; 3) trap is restricted to the study of translation within cells, and needs a genetically modified strain for each cell type of interest.

our method may a have some drawbacks. first, cell dissociation does not allow to study the interactions between different kind of cells. second, it is dependent on the quality of the antibody used to capture epithelial cells. third, the yield may vary depending on experimental settings, but this should be considered as informative data rather than as a bias.

in addition to allowing flow cytometry analysis and cell-type specific isolation, our methods yields live cells that can be used for cell-specific primary cultures, which may be very useful for studying the phenotype of a specific cell-type in any animal strain .

CONCLUSIONS
overall, we believe that our method offers a robust and simple tool to isolate and further study a specific cell type from an organ downstream of in vivo experimental models. this method allows a better understanding of cell-type specific biological processes in a solid organ, and provides easy cell-specific primary cultures for any chosen animal strain.
