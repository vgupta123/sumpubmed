BACKGROUND
the non-viral plasmid vector pepi- <dig> was constructed in  <dig> by piechaczek et al  <cit> , by cloning a  <dig> bp long matrix attachment region sequence , that was derived of the human β-interferon gene cluster  <cit> , into the commercial vector pgfp-c <dig> . the pepi- <dig> vector contains a total of  <dig> cpg motives, most of them within the vector elements necessary for bacterial propagation. furthermore, pepi- <dig> consists of two mammalian transcription units oriented in a clockwise direction. the first, cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter  driven enhanced green fluorescent protein  transcription unit is oriented into the mars and has been shown to be a functional component of the pepi- <dig> vector plasmid replicon. the second, simian virus  <dig> ori/promoter  driven neomycin phosphotransferase  transcription unit has been used for bacterial and mammalian selection purposes, but is dispensable for the vectors' episomal replication in mammalian cells. pepi- <dig> replicates episomally in a copy number of approximately 5- <dig> molecules per cell in all mammalian cell lines tested, is mitotically stable even in the absence of selection and facilitates long-term expression of transgenes or shrna's  <cit> . the vector replicates once per cell cycle during early s-phase, with the origin recognition complex  being able to assemble at various regions on the vector dna  <cit> . the episomal replication is due to stable association with early replication foci by mars mediated binding to the nuclear matrix protein scaffold attachment factor a . within early replication foci, dna replication of pepi- <dig> vector molecules is likely facilitated by a conformational change resulting from mrna transcription  <cit>  . the mitotic stability of pepi-based vectors can be explained by the mars mediated stable interaction with metaphase chromosomes  <cit>  . the functional element of the pepi- <dig> plasmid replicon could be mapped as transcription unit, regulated by a constitutive promoter and directed into a chromosomal mars without termination signal between transcription unit and mars  <cit>  .

similar to ebv plasmid replicons administered as naked dna, the establishment of stable pepi- <dig> episomes in transfected cells is very inefficient  <cit> : only  <dig> -5% of transiently pepi-1-transfected cells develop stable clones. this is also the case when pepi- <dig> plasmids are isolated from already established mammalian cell clones and reintroduced into cells demonstrating that the primary sequence of dna is not involved in the establishment process  <cit>  but rather epigenetic features such as chromatin structure and nuclear localization  <cit> .

a cytosine monophosphate  followed by a guanine monophosphate  in a nucleotide sequence is referred to as cpg dinucleotide . in eukaryotic dna, cpg dinucleotides in eukaryotes appear at lower frequency and are often methylated to 5-methyl-cytosine , whereas in most bacterial genomes, however, cpg dinucleotides are represented according to their statistical expectation, and the cytosine residue is normally unmethylated  <cit> . the human innate immune system has evolved mechanisms to differentiate bacterial dna from its own via toll-like receptor  <dig>  signalling. tlr <dig> interacts with endocytosed dna comprising unmethylated cpg dinucleotides and triggers downstream signalling via myd <dig>  irak and traf <dig> to increase nfêb and ap <dig> expression. this in turn results in the production of inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . in fact, hyde et al. demonstrated that a single cpg motif present in a dna vector backbone elicits an inflammation after pulmonary delivery in vivo  <cit> .

the majority of human promoters belong to the high-cpg class of promoters, for which it is well established that the methylation status of the surrounding cpg islands has a direct influence on the promoter activity unmethylated cpg islands in the promoter region correspond to active promoters, whereas heavily methylated mcpg islands correspond to inactive promoters  <cit> . the cmv-iep is most often used in commercial vectors conferring robust expression of a transgene in several cell types. this strong activity is due to the presence of several transcription factor binding sites within its sequence. the expression profile of cmv-iep typically peaks at around 1- <dig> days after vector administration, followed by a steady decrease in its activity over a period of 1- <dig> weeks. methylation of cpg islands within the cmv-iep region has been suggested as one explanation for this long-known, but undesired silencing phenomenon  <cit> , even if recent publications indicate other mechanisms for this effect  <cit> .

taken together, these findings suggest that a state of the art plasmid vector for gene delivery into mammalian cells should be composed of a promoter element that is depleted of cpg islands in order to minimize silencing phenomena, and a cpg depleted vector backbone to prevent undesired stimulatory effects on the innate immune system  <cit> . such optimized plasmid vectors have already been realized as cpg depleted vectors  <cit>  exhibiting increased levels and persistence of transgene expression, as well as reduced inflammation in vivo.

in the present study we hypothesized that pepi- <dig> based plasmid replicons can be improved by reducing the cpg content in the vector backbone to achieve more efficient transgene expression in vitro and in vivo. the novel vector named pepito has been constructed by cloning the pepi- <dig> plasmid replicon into a plasmid backbone without cpg islands and omitting a second transcription unit.

herein we demonstrate that the novel pepito vector exhibits several advantages over its precursor pepi- <dig>  including higher transgene expression levels and colony-forming efficiencies in vitro and more persistent transgene expression profiles in vivo. additionally, the performance of all vectors is improved when replacing the cmv-iep by the human cmv enhancer/human elongation factor  <dig> alpha promoter  element, that is known to be less affected by epigenetic silencing events  <cit> .

RESULTS
generation of pepi-based vectors with improved efficacy
we systematically generated a panel of  <dig> different pepi-1-derived vectors, all of them constructed in a modular way enabling the easy exchange of backbone, promoter, or transgene elements by restriction digest with pcii, nhei, bglii, or mlui . vectors based on the pepi- <dig> backbones contain a puc ori for bacterial propagation, a mars, a second mammalian sv40-o/p driven npt transcription unit for bacterial kanamycin or mammalian geneticin  selection purposes, and a total of  <dig> cpg motives. the pepito backbones contain a r6k ori  <cit>  for bacterial propagation, a β-lactamase gene  for bacterial ampicillin selection, a mars, no second mammalian transcription unit, and only  <dig> cpg motives. control vectors pepi-1-Δmars and pepito-Δmars without mars elements contain a total of  <dig> and  <dig> cpg motives, respectively. all vectors contain either the cmv-iep, or the hcmv/ef1p promoter element, with the latter one known to be less affected by epigenetic silencing events  <cit> . depending on the experiment, three different transgenes have been used: an egfp-bsd cassette with which both egfp  and bsd  are expressed via a synthetic internal ribosomal entry site   <cit> , a firefly luciferase   <cit> , or an egfp-luciferase fusion protein   <cit> . all  <dig> different vectors have been constructed, propagated, and amplified in e.coli db <dig> ëpir  <cit> .

increased transgene expression and colony formation of pepito vectors in vitro
in order to compare the novel cpg depleted pepito vector backbone with the original pepi- <dig> vector backbone, a set of eight novel vectors were constructed . all novel vectors comprised an identical transgene, i.e. an egfp-bsd cassette connected via a recently described,  <dig> bp long internal ribosomal entry site   <cit> . this cassette enabled both the analysis of transgene  expression by flow cytometry and the selection of transfected mammalian cells with blasticidin.

in vitro experiments were performed in hek <dig> and nih3t <dig> cells, with the latter cell line having shown to silence exogenous dna rapidly  <cit>  . equal amounts of vector dna were used to exclude undesired effects of any added stuffer dna, as for example sonicated salmon sperm dna or any other small plasmid dna with varying cpg contents. transient transfection results assayed by flow cytometry of egfp positive cells  <dig> hours post transfection are shown . on hek <dig> cells, all pepito-based vectors exhibited transfection efficiencies of around 75%, independent of plasmid size, promoter type, or the presence or absence of the mars element, whereas with all pepi- <dig> based vectors 45-65% egfp positive cells were found . pepi- <dig> based vectors with hcmv/ef1p promoter element resulted in the lowest transient transfection efficiencies, indicating an effect of the used promoter elements. when performing identical experiments on nih3t <dig> cells, overall lower transient transfection efficiencies were observed, ranging from 4% to 16% . the pepito-Δmars vectors, the smallest vectors used, exhibited the highest transient transfection efficiency indicating either an inverted effect of the plasmid size, or an effect of the initial molar amount of dna used for transfection or both. in pepi- <dig> based vector constructs the hcmv/ef1p promoter element exhibit lower transient transfection efficiencies compared to the cmv-iep promoter element, and smaller, mars depleted vectors exhibit higher transfection efficiencies compared to the larger plasmid constructs.

when analyzing the level of egfp per cell, the mean egfp intensity levels hek <dig> cells were not significantly different in six out of the eight novel vector constructs . only pepi-1- -  and pepi-1- - -Δmars resulted in a lower egfp signal indicating an effect of the promoter elements only within the pepi- <dig> vector backbone . in nih3t <dig> cells, pepito based vectors with hcmv/ef1p promoter resulted in slightly higher egfp expression levels as compared to the cmv-iep . in contrast, pepi-based vectors with cmv-iep promoter always resulted in slightly higher expression levels as the respective hcmv/ef1p promoter constructs. in concordance with transfection efficiencies, the overall mean intensity of the egfp signal, however, was much weaker in nih3t <dig> cells than in hek <dig> 

for further analysis, stably selected mixed-clone cells were generated from initially transfected cells as batch by selection with blasticidin for  <dig> days. when selecting hek <dig> cells transfected with the eight different vector constructs, stably selected mixed-clone cells could be obtained in all cases . in hek <dig> cells the mean egfp signal intensity per cell was influenced by the promoter element used, the nature of the vector backbone, and the presence or absence of a mars. vectors with the cmv-iep promoter element exhibited higher egfp expression levels as compared to their corresponding vectors with the hcmv/ef1p promoter element. furthermore, pepito-based vectors always exhibited higher expression levels compared to their respective pepi-1-based counterparts. finally, vectors with a mars element always performed better than their mars depleted controls, with respect to the egfp expression level . with nih3t <dig> cells, stably selected mixed-clone cells could not be obtained with the three cmv-iep promoter element containing constructs indicating a negative effect of the cmv-iep promoter element on the establishment of stable nih3t <dig> cell lines . the mean egfp signal intensity per cell was mainly influenced by the promoter element and the nature of the vector backbone used, as the cpg depleted pepito vectors always performed better than their pepi-1-based counterparts. as most vectors based on the cmv-iep promoter element could not be selected to obtain stable mixed-clones and that the vector pepito- -  exhibits a weaker mean egfp signal intensity then the vector pepito- - , we conclude that the promoter element has a strong influence on the egfp expression levels in nih3t <dig> cells. in contrast to hek <dig> cells, the promoter preference is inverted in nih3t <dig> cells with the hcmv/ef1p always performing better than the cmv-iep promoter element .

the episomal status of all four mars bearing vectors could be verified by bacterial rescue experiments using chromosomal dna extracted from stably selected hek <dig> mixed-clones. rescued plasmids did not exhibit any rearrangements as checked by restriction analysis and gel electrophoresis . the plasmids pepito- -  and pepito- -  could be rescued from chromosomal dna extracted from stably selected nih3t <dig> cells, but no mars depleted control vector could be rescued .

first column: consecutive vector numbers and systematic vector names. second and third column: rescue from hek <dig> and nih3t <dig> at  <dig> days post transfection . fourth column: rescue from mouse genomic liver dna of mice sacrificed at  <dig> days post injection . the first number always indicates the number of rescue experiments were plasmid dna could be rescued without any rearrangement from the isolated chromosomal dna. the second number indicates the total number of performed rescue experiments. '-' indicates that no clones could be obtained by a particular rescue experiment; n.a.: not assayed.

to further analyze colony-forming efficiencies of the eight novel vectors, transfected hek <dig> and nih3t <dig> cells were serially diluted and selected with blasticidin. in case of hek <dig> cells the results of the colony-forming assays performed are presented as fold increase in relation to pepi-1- - -Δmars . since this vector did not result in any stably selected nih3t <dig> cells, the results of the colony-forming assays in nih3t <dig> cells are presented as fold increase in relation to pepi-1- - -Δmars, . in hek <dig> cells, pepito- -  exhibited a ~ <dig> fold increased colony-forming efficiency over its pepi-Δmars-control, followed by a ~ <dig> fold increase within pepito- - , indicating a positive effect of the mars sequence in the pepito vector backbone on colony-forming efficiency. vectors based on the pepito-Δmars or pepi- <dig> vector backbones exhibited a ~ <dig> fold increased colony-forming efficiency as compared to the vectors based on the pepi-1-Δmars vector backbones in hek <dig> cells, indicating a positive effect of the cpg depleted pepito-Δmars vector backbone or the presence of a mars element on colony-forming efficiency .

in nih3t <dig> cells, only vectors based on the hcmv/ef <dig> promoter element resulted in significant numbers of formed colonies : pepito- -  exhibited a ~ <dig> fold increased colony-forming efficiency as compared to pepi-1- - -Δmars indicating a positive effect of the pepito vector backbone. vectors based on the pepito-Δmars vector backbones exhibited a ~ <dig> fold increased colony-forming efficiency as compared to the vectors based on the pepi-1-Δmars vector backbones indicating a positive effect of the cpg depleted pepito-Δmars vector backbone on colony establishment.

increased expression and stability of pepito vectors in murine liver in vivo
the in vivo performance of the novel pepito vector backbones was studied in mf- <dig> mice by hydrodynamic injection of  <dig> μg of respective vectors intravenously into mf- <dig> mice and the transgene expression in the liver measured over time by bioluminescence imaging as described earlier  <cit> . for this purpose, a set of four novel pepito vectors were constructed containing the egfp::luc fusion protein as transgene transcription unit. . the vector pepi-1- -   has been included as additional control , which contains a firefly luciferase  transgene instead of the egfp::luc fusion protein . the sequences of both luciferases, however, are identical. in concordance with all previous  experiments, equal amounts of vector dna have been injected, in order to avoid undesired effects of any added stuffer dna. luciferase activity was quantified after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days post injection  . all animals exhibited an equally strong luciferase signal on day one after injection, at later time points the luciferase signal steadily decreased. with the pepi- <dig> based control vector pepi-1- - , and in the two mars depleted pepito control vectors pepito- - -Δmars and pepito- - -Δmars the luciferase signal is weakly detectable until  <dig> d.p.i., but is below detection limit at  <dig> d.p.i this result indicated a positive effect of the pepito vector backbone and the mars element on prolonged luciferase expression. in contrast, the two pepito based vectors pepito- -  and pepito- -  exhibit a longer lasting luciferase expression until  <dig> d.p.i obviously, the pepito vector with the hcmv/ef1p promoter element exhibited the strongest in vivo luciferase expression  <dig> d.p.i., about  <dig> fold higher compared to the cmv-iep in pepito and more than a  <dig> log difference to pepi-luc indicating a positive effect of the hcmv/ef1p promoter element on prolonged transgene expression in mf- <dig> mice in vivo. after sacrificing all animals at  <dig> d.p.i., chromosomal dna was extracted from their livers. in order to estimate the copy numbers of vector molecules present in liver tissues a quantitative pcr  was performed. vector dna could be detected in all animals at  <dig> d.p.i the copy number of vector molecules as detected by qpcr varied between  <dig>  -  <dig> vector molecules per liver cell, but did not vary significantly within the livers of the animals injected with any of the five different vector constructs, implying that no degradation  of vector dna is responsible for the decrease in the luciferase signal over time . as indicated in table  <dig>  the two pepito based vectors with mars element, i.e. pepito- -  and pepito- - , could be rescued from chromosomal liver dna preparations without any rearrangements at  <dig> d.p.i., indicating that the presence of a mars element within the pepito vector backbone facilitates the persistence of episomes in a "rescue"-able form in vivo. we did not succeed in rescuing pepi- -luc.

discussion
in this manuscript we present a novel pepi-vector derivative, named pepito, with higher transgene expression levels and increased colony-forming efficiencies in vitro, and more persistent transgene expression profiles in vivo. in order to compare the novel pepito-backbone with the backbone of the original vector, pepi- <dig>  a series of  <dig> novel vectors was constructed. eight vectors, comprising an identical transgene transcription unit, i.e. egfp-ires-bsd, were generated to evaluate vector-backbone performance in vitro. these eight vector constructs were subsequently selected for bsd expression, present in the first transgene transcription unit that is part of the pepi-vectors' episomal plasmid replicon . this is noteworthy, since all previous pepi- <dig> based vectors were selected for the npt gene, present in the second dispensable sv40-o/p driven transcription unit  <cit> . it is also worth mentioning, that in previous studies the expression of the first, cmv-iep promoter driven transgene transcription unit has not been studied extensively, since main focus was laid on the analysis of the vectors' episomal replication potential, but not on transgene expression levels  <cit> . in these studies partial, i.e. background, integration of few pepi-vectors was never fully excluded, but the episomal maintenance and replication was described  <cit> . when assaying all novel egfp-ires-bsd cassette containing vectors, the cpg-depleted, pepito based constructs constantly performed better than the pepi- <dig> based constructs, with respect to transient transfection efficiencies, transient egfp expression levels, egfp expression levels within stably selected cells, and colony-forming efficiency . since all experiments were performed by transfecting equal amounts of vector dna - and not equal molar ratios of vector molecules,- to exclude side effects of stuffer dna, some of the differences within the increased transient transfection efficiencies of the smaller plasmids are caused by this. pepito-based vectors are on average some 25% smaller than their respective pepi-1-based counterparts and as a consequence ~one third more pepito vector molecules as compared to its direct pepi- <dig> counterpart had been transfected initially. the differences in transient egfp expression, the egfp expression levels of stably selected mixed-clones, and the 7- <dig> fold increase in colony-forming efficiency are impressive and not caused by the different equimolar levels of the transfected dna, which differ at a maximum of 33%. the known establishment efficiency for pepi-1-replicons is about 1-5%  <cit> . in our modified experimental setup this efficiency was lower, considering the colony-forming assay, the initial transfection rate and cell growth, and resulted in about  <dig> % of the transfected and selected cells for the pepi-1- -construct, and - ~ <dig> fold higher - about  <dig> % for the comparable pepito- -construct in hek  <dig> 

increased transgene expression levels and longer lasting transgene expression in vitro and in vivo have also been reported for so-called minicircles which lack any residual elements necessary for bacterial propagation  <cit> , or for cpg-depleted or cpg-free vectors that have been constructed depleted or free of any cpg motives  <cit> . it was shown, that the cpg content of a minicircles' transgene transcription unit does not affect the epigenetic silencing of its transgene  <cit> , in contrast to epigenetic elements present in the bacterial origin of replication or backbone  <cit> . chen et al. speculate that there might be a recruitment of repressive heterochromatin as inducer of a silencing complex that is initiated within bacterial vector elements  <cit> , implying an important role of the chromatin structure for epigenetic silencing. as bacterial elements usually contain cpg motifs, the known effects of cpg-isles and the work of chen et al.  <cit>  are neither identical nor contradictory, but these effects might be linked at some points in our understanding. further research has to elucidate, if and how these facts are connected. no or only weak silencing effects have been described within cpg-free plasmids  <cit> . our novel pepito vector, which consists of a rather cpg-rich transgene transcription unit within a cpg-depleted bacterial vector backbone, seems to exhibit similar expression profiles as the described minicircles and cpg-free vectors.

the cmv-iep promoter element is frequently used within commercial plasmid vectors, since it confers robust expression of a transgene in several cell types. the expression profile of cmv-iep, however, decreases steadily over time, which could be explained by methylation of cytosines within this promoter region  <cit> . for pepi- <dig> based vectors methylation of cytosines within the cmv-iep promoter region has been reported to be inhibited by the vector encoded mars element in cho and hacat cells in vitro  <cit> . in contrast, argyros et al. described silencing of a cmv-iep promoter driven luciferase transgene within a pepi- <dig> vector backbone after hydrodynamic gene delivery in mice. within the latter study, however, the cytosine methylation of the cmv-iep promoter element has not been investigated in detail  <cit> . taken together, no cytosine methylation of cmv-iep promoter elements within pepi-based vectors has been observed so far in vitro and in vivo. therefore, a possible explanation for the silencing of transgenes regulated by the cmv-iep promoter element within a pepi-vector backbone might be histone deacetylation as proposed by papapetrou et al.  <cit> .

when comparing the cmv-iep and hcmv/ef1p promoter elements within our constructs , it is obvious that the relative promoter strength has a strong influence on vector performance. in case of stably selected hek <dig> cells, cmv-iep promoter based vectors exhibited a stronger transgene expression - as a measure of promoter strength - as vectors based on the relatively weaker hcmv/ef1p promoter element . this situation, however, is inverted in stably selected nih3t <dig> mixed-clones, in which the hcmv/ef1p promoter element results in higher transgene expression levels than the cmv-iep . we assume that increased transgene expression levels reflect increased transgene mrna transcription levels, despite this has not been experimentally verified so far.

in both, hek <dig> and nih3t <dig> cells, the colony-forming efficiency of vectors with a functional pepi-plasmid replicon, i.e. all mars containing vectors, seems to partially correlate with the relative promoter strength . the rather weak performance of the cmv-iep promoter element within nih3t <dig> cells has been already described by nehlsen et al.  <cit> . these findings suggest, that the cmv-iep promoter element seems to be extraordinarily susceptible for epigenetic silencing within nih3t <dig> cells. for the latter cell line rapid silencing of exogenous plasmid dna by histone deacetylation has been frequently observed  <cit> . the hypothesis presented in chen et al.  <cit> , i.e. the formation of heterochromatin after histone deacetylation involvement  <cit>  triggered by certain bacterial elements, may serve as an explanation for the better performance of pepito based vectors with respect to transgene expression and colony-forming efficiency within stably selected nih3t <dig> cells , since the pepi- <dig> vector backbones exhibit significantly higher numbers of cpg motives .

the positive effect of the mars element within the different pepi-vector backbones can be observed best within our colony-forming assays in vitro and within the expression profiles of our mf- <dig> mice in vivo. in all colony-forming assays the presence of a mars as a functional component of the pepi-vector plasmid replicon  increased the number of established colonies as compared to their respective control vectors without mars . this could be explained by the episomal replication of respective vectors, which could be further supported by bacterial rescue experiments . the cpg depleted backbone also influences the colony forming efficiencies. as the pepi-replicon needs the transcription into the mars-element to establish an episome, the higher transgene expression of the pepito vectors might lead to a higher chance of an establishing event, resulting in higher colony forming unit numbers. in mf- <dig> mice the pepito based vectors with the mars elements resulted in prolonged transgene expression . since liver cells are quiescent cells, episomal replication of pepi-based vectors might not serve as a suitable explanation for the prolonged transgene expression. above all, we showed by qpcr that all five hydrodynamically delivered vectors persisted at equal copy numbers of approximately  <dig>  -  <dig> vector molecules per liver cell. the failure of rescuing of the pepi- <dig> based vector could be due to the formation of heterochromatin as discussed for the in vitro results before. we favour the theory, that the prolonged transgene expression profiles of pepito-based vectors in vivo results from a combination of  reduced epigenetic silencing due to the modified bacterial vector backbone  <cit> , and  the presence of the mars which might trigger the translocation of vector molecules to sites of active chromatin   <cit> , or enhance overall transcription levels  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we developed a cpg-depleted pepi-vector derivative named pepito in this study which combines the ability of episomal replication and mitotic stability described for pepi-based vectors with the diminished tendency towards epigenetic silencing of vector encoded transgenes due to the cpg depletion of the vector backbone. in contrast to recently described minicircles, pepito-based vectors can be propagated, modified, and amplified in e.coli db <dig> λpir. we could further demonstrate, that the cpg content and/or the bacterial vector backbone of any plasmid vector exhibits a strong influence on long-term transgene expression. the detailed molecular mechanism of the epigenetic silencing of vector encoded transgenes has to be further investigated. our novel pepito vector will have crucial implementations for biotechnological applications in vitro, e.g. within the fast generation of stably selected mixed-clone cells with arbitrary transgenes at low costs. due to its ability for prolonged transgene expression in vivo, pepito is also expected to serve as an improved vector for non-viral gene therapy.
