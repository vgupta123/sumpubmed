BACKGROUND
there are  <dig> serotypes  of botulinum neurotoxins  and types a, b, e or f are the most frequent causes of botulism in humans. strains of clostridium botulinum producing bont/e share similar metabolic characteristics including the inability to digest proteins such as gelatin, casein, or meat. these non-proteolytic strains are psychrophilic with the ability to grow at refrigeration temperatures
 <cit> . in rare cases, strains of clostridium butyricum have been shown to produce bont/e
 <cit> .

clostridium botulinum type e strains can be isolated from various marine environments and cases of botulism due to bont/e typically occur in canada, alaska, northern europe, and japan
 <cit> . a total of  <dig> cases of type e botulism were reported to the centers for disease control and prevention between 2001– <dig> and  <dig> % of these cases occurred in alaska . type e botulism has also occurred in the lower  <dig> states including various outbreaks associated with smoked fish from the great lakes
 <cit> . a recent outbreak of botulism in birds and fish in the great lakes region was attributed to genetically distinct strains of c. botulinum type e and the organism was also found in lake sediment
 <cit> . a case of infant botulism occurred in illinois in  <dig> although the source of spores in this case could not be determined
 <cit> .

genetic analysis of 16s rrna sequences from various c. botulinum strains reveals the presence of distinct phylogenetic groups 
 <cit>  which correspond to previously recognized metabolic differences. all group ii strains are non-proteolytic and include type e strains and some type b and type f strains. nucleotide sequencing of various toxin genes has demonstrated the presence of amino acid variation within genes encoding a single toxin serotype and these variants are identified as toxin subtypes
 <cit> . among type e strains, a total of  <dig> such subtypes  have been identified
 <cit> . these subtypes differ at the amino acid level by up to 6%.

the genes encoding bont/a-g are found in toxin gene clusters that also encode several nontoxic proteins and regulatory proteins. the gene encoding bont/e is found within a toxin gene cluster that includes ntnh , p <dig>  and orfx1- <dig> <cit> . hill et al.
 <cit>  demonstrated that the bont/e toxin gene cluster inserted into the rara operon. the transposon-associated gene, rara, likely plays a role in this insertion event in which the gene is split into small and large fragments that flank the toxin gene cluster
 <cit> . remarkably, an intact rara gene is also located within the toxin gene cluster and the nucleotide sequences of the intact and split genes were shown to differ by phylogenetic analysis. moreover, the split rara gene fragments can be pasted together to form a gene with a nucleotide sequence with similarity to the gene found in the group ii c. botulinum type b strain 17b. in another study, the intact and split rara genes were detected across a panel of  <dig> type e strains
 <cit> .

in this study, we characterized a previously unreported c. botulinum type e strain isolated in  <dig> from soil in chubut, argentina. this represents the first report of a type e strain  originating from the southern hemisphere. we further show evidence that this strain produces a unique type e toxin subtype and that the genetic background of this strain is highly divergent compared to other type e strains.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis of bont/e in c. botulinum strains
the nucleotide sequence of the entire bont/e gene was determined for each of the  <dig> c. botulinum type e strains examined in this study. previous studies have identified several bont/e subtypes
 <cit> . nucleotide sequences of bont/e determined in this study were compared along with representatives of other reported bont/e subtypes . it is important to note that in some cases strain names used in previous reports may not refer to identical strains examined in this study with a similar name. for instance, the cdc reference strain labeled “alaska” harbored a gene encoding a subtype e <dig> toxin and is unlikely to be related to the genome-sequenced strain alaska e <dig>  which encodes a subtype e <dig> toxin. another strain labeled “minnesota” was distinguished from a strain with the same name reported by macdonald et al.
 <cit> . the cdc minnesota strain harbored an e <dig> subtype-encoding gene while the strain examined by macdonald et al.
 <cit>  encoded an e <dig> subtype toxin.

strain cdc <dig> harbored a significantly divergent bont/e gene which formed a unique clade when compared to other bont/e genes. comparison of the translated amino acid sequence of this gene with the gene encoding bont/e <dig> in strain beluga indicated that the sequences differed by ~11%. since previous comparisons of bont/e subtypes resulted in differences of up to 6% amino acid sequence variation, the bont/e produced by strain cdc <dig> can be considered a unique subtype 
 <cit> . comparison of the amino acid sequence of bont/e <dig> with representatives of bont/e subtypes e1-e <dig> demonstrated that the most divergent region of the toxin was located in the last ~ <dig> residues  which corresponds to the c-terminal part of the heavy chain  that is involved with binding to neuronal cells
 <cit> . blast analysis of this region indicated < 75% amino acid sequence identity with other bont/e sequences.

blast analysis of the 16s rrna nucleotide sequence from strain cdc <dig> shared >  <dig> % identity with strains alaska e <dig> and 17b indicating that the strain clusters with other group ii c. botulinum strains
 <cit> .

mass spectrometric analysis of bont/e produced by strain cdc66177
since the bont/e produced by strain cdc <dig> appeared to be a previously unreported toxin subtype, the enzymatic light chain activity of the toxin was assessed in culture supernatants generated from the strain. the light chain of bont/e cleaves the synaptosomal-associated protein, snap- <dig>  and the endopep-ms method was used to measure this activity upon a specific peptide substrate mimic of snap- <dig> . endopep-ms analysis revealed that the toxin cleaved the peptide substrate for bont/e in the expected location, resulting in products with peaks at m/z  <dig>  and  <dig> 
 <cit>  .

bont/e <dig> extracted from culture supernatants of strain cdc <dig> was subjected to tryptic digestion and the products were analyzed by mass spectrometry to confirm that the toxin's amino acid sequence was indeed unique based on the predicted translation of the dna sequence. the amino acid sequence of bont/e <dig> was determined with  <dig> % coverage .

dna microarray analysis of strain cdc66177
a group ii c. botulinum subtyping dna microarray
 <cit>  was used to evaluate gene content in a panel of  <dig> group ii strains from the cdc culture collection. briefly, this array featured  <dig> probes targeting ~15% of the annotated genes in the c. botulinum type e strain alaska e <dig> and  <dig> additional probes targeting genes present on the bont/b-encoding plasmid  in c. botulinum type b strain 17b. genomic dna isolated from  <dig> type e strains  hybridized with  <dig> % of the probes on this array while dna isolated from type b strains  and type f strains  hybridized with  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the probes, respectively. genomic dna from strain cdc <dig> hybridized with  <dig> % of the probes present on the array.

comparison of the profile of present or absent genes demonstrated the presence of two clusters of strains . cluster  <dig> consisted entirely of type e strains. interestingly, strain cdc <dig> grouped with cluster  <dig> which included the group ii type b and type f strains examined in this study.

southern hybridization of the split rara gene in strain cdc66177
in order to determine if the toxin gene cluster in cdc <dig> inserted into the rara operon as described for other type e strains
 <cit> , we performed southern hybridization using a probe that binds to the larger split rara gene fragment in type e strains or the intact rara gene in the type b strain 17b. genomic dna isolated from cdc <dig>  beluga, and 17b was digested with xbai and hybridized with the probe. the presence of xbai sites flanking the intact rara gene in strain 17b generated a ~ <dig>  kb fragment that hybridized the rara probe shown in figure
 <dig>  a ~ <dig>  kb fragment hybridized with the rara probe in dna isolated from strain beluga. these results were expected based on analysis of the c. botulinum type e strain beluga genome sequence  which demonstrated the presence of separate xbai sites flanking the larger split rara than found at the corresponding intact rara gene in strain 17b . the rara probe hybridized a similar size fragment in several other type e strains examined . unexpectedly, a ~ <dig>  kb band was hybridized by the probe using dna isolated from strain cdc <dig> suggesting the possibility that the regions flanking the toxin gene insertion in this strain were not similar to those of other type e strains.

whole genome shotgun sequencing of strain cdc66177
since the region flanking the rara operon in strain cdc <dig> was suspected to be unlike that of other type e strains, whole genome shotgun sequencing of this strain was performed using the pacbio smrt sequencer. an ~ <dig>  mb draft sequence consisting of  <dig> contigs was assembled . analysis of this sequence revealed that the toxin gene cluster inserted into the rara operon . the nucleotide sequence of the bont/e gene extracted from the genome sequence data was identical to that determined previously by sanger sequencing. the nucleotide sequence of a ~ <dig>  kb region starting at alas and extending through clh_ <dig>  was similar to that found in strain 17b but differed from the sequences found in strains alaska e <dig> and beluga.

as shown in figure
 <dig>  the regions between orfx <dig> and the larger split rara fragment  and between the smaller split rara fragment and bont/e  contain insertion sequences that are likely involved with transposon-mediated mobility of the toxin gene cluster
 <cit> . it is notable that regions i and ii differ in size and nucleotide sequence between strains alaska e <dig> and cdc <dig>  in order to determine if the nucleotide sequences of these regions are strain-specific, we also performed an alignment of these regions with strain beluga. interestingly, region i in strain beluga differed from both cdc <dig> and alaska e <dig> while region ii was identical to that found in alaska e <dig>  while the mechanism of toxin gene cluster insertion into the rara operon is unclear, the sequence similarity in region ii between strains beluga and alaska e <dig> suggests at least a partial similarity in the origin of the recombination event that results in the insertion of the toxin gene cluster. however, strain cdc <dig> lacks similarity to either strain beluga or alaska e <dig> at either region suggesting that the recombination event resulting in the insertion of the toxin gene cluster in strain cdc <dig> originated differently compared to strains beluga or alaska e <dig> 

analysis of the genome sequence data explains the unexpected ~ <dig>  kb band hybridized by the rara probe in strain cdc <dig>  the presence of an xbai site within the toxin gene cluster of both cdc <dig> and alaska e <dig> and an additional site downstream of the larger rara fragment in strain cdc <dig> yield an ~ <dig>  kb fragment. notably the genome sequence of strain 17b also demonstrates the presence of a xbai site downstream of the intact rara gene. similar to other type e toxin gene clusters, strain cdc <dig> contains an intact rara gene that does not hybridize the rara probe used in our studies. blast analysis of this gene demonstrated 98% nucleotide similarity with the gene present in alaska e <dig> 

since the bont/e gene in strain cdc <dig> displayed significant divergence compared to other reported bont/e genes, we compared the nucleotide sequences of the remaining toxin gene cluster components  to those found in alaska e <dig> and beluga . while these genes are nearly identical in alaska e <dig> and beluga, the genes in cdc <dig> ranged from  <dig> - <dig> % nucleotide identity compared to those in alaska e <dig> and/or beluga.

in order to further investigate the genomic sequence of strain cdc <dig>  the average nucleotide identity  of this strain was compared to alaska e <dig> and beluga. briefly,  <dig>  nucleotide fragments of the query genome were compared to the subject genome using blast to determine the ani value
 <cit> . richter and rosselló-móra
 <cit>  proposed an ani of 95-96% as the boundary of considering two genomes as belonging to a single bacterial species. while comparison of the genomes of strains alaska e <dig> and beluga resulted in an ani > 97%, comparison of strain cdc <dig> with alaska e <dig> and beluga resulted in ani values between 93-94% . interestingly, comparison of strain cdc <dig> with 17b displayed > 98% ani while comparison of either alaska e <dig> or beluga with 17b resulted in ani values < 94%. importantly, only the strain 17b chromosomal sequence was used in these calculations. however, ani calculations were based on the entire cdc <dig> genome sequence since it is unknown if any of the contigs represent mobile elements such as plasmids. notably, all three strains , share nearly identical 16s rrna sequences and clearly cluster with group ii c. botulinum .

† the following genome sequences were used in the ani analysis: beluga, accession number: acsc <dig> ; cdc <dig>  accession number: alyj <dig> ; 17b, accession number: nc_ <dig>  ; alaska e <dig>  nc_ <dig>  .

* ani values ≥ 96% are marked with an asterisk.

our analysis of the genetic diversity of type e strains using a dna microarray was limited to those isolated from botulism cases. therefore, we considered the possibility that strain cdc <dig> was genotypically divergent since it was isolated from an environmental source. we performed an in silico analysis of multilocus sequence typing  alleles from selected type e strains  reported by macdonald et al.
 <cit> . these alleles were compared with alleles extracted from the genome sequences of strains 17b and cdc <dig>  not surprisingly, strains 17b and cdc <dig> formed a separate clade when concatenated mlst alleles were compared to other type e strains .

CONCLUSIONS
in a previous study
 <cit> , botulinum toxin-producing clostridia were isolated from  <dig> % of soil samples collected in argentina. the distribution of toxin serotypes reported from the southern region of argentina included types a, b, and f. in this study, we characterized a previously unreported c. botulinum type e strain  isolated in  <dig> from soil collected in chubut, argentina. this region is located at a latitude of approximately 43°s which is located as far from the equator as the great lakes are located in the northern hemisphere. while strain cdc <dig> was isolated from soil in proximity to the atlantic ocean, it is notable that no cases of type e botulism have been reported in argentina. this is the first known report of the isolation of this strain and extends the known global distribution of c. botulinum type e.

while the strain cdc <dig> produces a novel bont/e subtype, the toxin was shown to cleave a peptide substrate in the same location as other bont/e subtypes. it remains to be determined if the toxin produced by this strain varies in its neuronal cell receptor compared to other bont/e subtypes. finally, the presence of bont/e in the rara operon of a strain with genetic similarity to strain 17b raises the intriguing possibility of a bivalent non-proteolytic strain expressing bont/e encoded by a chromosomally located gene and bont/b encoded by a plasmid .
