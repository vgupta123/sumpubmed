BACKGROUND
breast cancer is a leading cancer in women, accounting for 32% of new cancers. it is also the second leading cause of cancer death for women, and an estimated  <dig>  new cases occurred this year in the usa  <cit> . approximately 40% of primary human breast cancers tissues have shown expression of mrna that encodes a g-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channel  <dig> , and this expression of girk <dig> was associated with a more aggressive clinical behavior  <cit> . previous data from our laboratory has indicated that a functional link exists between the girk <dig> channel and the beta-adrenergic receptor pathway in breast cancer cell lines, and these pathways were involved in growth regulation of these cells  <cit> . the estrogen receptor positive  cell lines mcf- <dig>  mda-mb- <dig>  and zr-75- <dig> and the er negative  cell line mda-mb- <dig> expressed mrna for the girk <dig> channel, while the er  cell lines mda-mb- <dig> and mda-mb-435s did not express girk <dig>  <cit> .

ethanol has been shown to increase proliferation and camp levels in two er  cell lines  but not in er  cell lines   <cit> . although alcohol is an established risk factor for breast cancer , little is known of its mechanism of action. ethanol has been found to open g-protein inwardly rectifying potassium channels  in both the heart and brain  <cit> , but no effects of ethanol on girk channels in breast cancer have been reported in the literature. however, treatment of mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells with ethanol increased erk1/ <dig> activities and resulted in subsequent increased cell growth  <cit> .

in order to further investigate girk channels in breast cancer and possible stimulation by ethanol, we identified girk channel protein expression in breast cancer cells. previously we had identified girk channel mrna expression in multiple lung cancer cell lines; however girk <dig> protein expression was seen only in a subset of small cell lung cancer cell lines  <cit> . girk <dig> must assemble with either girk <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> to form functional channels because girk <dig> cannot form channels alone . therefore, in the present research, we determined that breast cancer cell lines express girk <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> and that ethanol alters the expression of the protein for these channels.

RESULTS
in order to further investigate the effects of girk channels in breast cancer, expression of girk proteins needed to be determined. since the predominant girk heterotetramers seem to be girk1/ <dig>  and girk1/ <dig>  , we concentrated on girk <dig>  girk  <dig>  and girk <dig> expression in these breast cancer cells. girk <dig> expression was shown at the correct molecular weight  in zr-75- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> . girk <dig> expression was also seen at a lower molecular weight  for zr-75- <dig>  mda-mb- <dig>  mcf- <dig>  mda-mb- <dig>  and mda-mb- <dig> . additional experiments also indicated girk <dig> was also expressed at the lower mw in mda-mb- <dig> cells . to determine that this lower mw protein was girk <dig> , we immuno-precipitated two samples of mda-mb- <dig> with goat polyclonal antibody  for girk <dig>  then separated by western blot and probed with rabbit polyclonal antibody . in these immuno-precipitated cells, girk <dig> protein expression was mainly seen at the lower mw . similar results were seen when mda-mb- <dig> cells were immuno-precipitated . girk <dig> must assemble with either girk <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> to form functional channels because girk <dig> cannot form channels alone . to determine if the other girk channel subunits exist in the breast cancer cells, we identified girk <dig> and girk <dig> expression. girk <dig> expression was shown at the correct molecular weight  in zr-75- <dig>  mcf- <dig>  and mda-mb- <dig> . girk <dig> expression was shown at the correct molecular weight  in all six cell lines .

the majority of our previous research has been done with the er  breast cancer cell line mda-mb- <dig>  <cit> . therefore, in the present study we continued using this cell line for studies on girk channel function. to determine if these girk channels are functional, we used ethanol, which is known to open girk channels  <cit> . girk <dig> protein expression was decreased by 5– <dig> minute ethanol treatment , and girk <dig> expression was changed at both mws. in addition, both girk <dig> and girk <dig> protein expression were decreased by 5– <dig> minute ethanol treatment . data presented in figure  <dig> did not indicate expression of girk <dig> in mda-mb- <dig> cells. in these experiments with ethanol treatment, however girk <dig> was expressed in mda-mb- <dig> cells. other experiments have indicated variable expression of girk <dig> in mda-mb- <dig> cells . this data indicates that expression of girk channels varies during long-term growth of the cells in culture.

to determine the effects of over-expression of girk <dig> and girk <dig> on mda-mb- <dig> cells, girk <dig> and girk <dig> plasmids were transfected into mda-mb- <dig> cells  <cit> . increased girk <dig> protein expression was seen in mda-mb- <dig> breast cancer cells  <dig> hours after transfection with girk <dig> or girk <dig> . these bands are also at the lower mw indicated in figure  <dig>  on the other hand,  <dig> hours after transfection of either girk <dig> or girk <dig> plasmids, girk <dig> gene expression was lowered in mda-mb- <dig> breast cancer cells. girk <dig> expression was decreased by girk <dig> transfection but increased by girk <dig> transfection. experiments were performed by real-time rt-pcr and are expressed as gene-specific ct value-18s control ct value; mean ± standard deviation. higher ct values indicate lower gene expression. girk <dig> gene expression–control:  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; girk1:  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; girk4:  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; p <  <dig> . girk <dig> gene expression–control:  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; girk1:  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; girk4:  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; p <  <dig> . all the above data indicate that the lower mw band in these cells is girk <dig> 

we found that the 16-hour serum-free  media pre-treatment normally used for western blot experiments largely inhibited girk <dig>  girk <dig> and girk <dig> protein expression in the mda-mb- <dig> cells . therefore, pre-treatment with sf media was not used in experimental treatments described in figure  <dig>  this decrease in expression may be due to lack of k+ ions in the media or to removal of estrogen. in support of this hypothesis, treatment of the mda-mb- <dig> cell line led to an increase in girk <dig> protein expression after treatment for  <dig> hours with charcoal-stripped serum, and girk <dig> levels returned to control levels with addition of estradiol . however, we saw a decrease in girk protein levels after  <dig> hours of treatment with estradiol but no change in protein expression in cells treated with charcoal-stripped serum, indicating that charcoal stripping and estradiol have different time-dependent effects on mda-mb- <dig> cells . to further investigate this decrease in girk <dig> expression, we incubated mda-mb- <dig> for  <dig> hours  and found this had no effect on girk <dig> mrna expression . however, previous data from our laboratory have indicated that 6– <dig> days of treatment were needed for β-adrenergic modification of girk <dig> gene expression in the mda-mb- <dig> cells  <cit> . therefore the mda-mb- <dig> cell line was grown in sf media for  <dig> days, after which real-time pcr revealed decreases in girk <dig> mrna expression. data are expressed as described above: control:  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; sf:  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; p <  <dig> . these results indicate that both girk <dig> protein and gene expression are inhibited by serum-free conditions.

discussion
our previous work has indicated that breast cancer cells express mrna for the girk channels. since protein expression would also be necessary for functional girk channels, we determined girk protein expression in the six breast cancer cell lines. zr-75- <dig>  mda-mb- <dig>  mcf- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> express girk <dig> mrna and protein; mda-mb-435s does not express girk <dig> protein or mrna; and mda-mb- <dig> expresses girk <dig> protein but not mrna  <cit> . in addition, data indicated that mrna for girk <dig> was observed in all cell lines except zr-75- <dig> and mda-mb-435s  <cit> . girk <dig> protein expression was seen in mda-mb- <dig>  mcf- <dig>  and zr-75- <dig> and has variable expression in mda-mb- <dig>  gene expression data also indicated that mrna for girk <dig> was observed in all cell lines  <cit> , while girk <dig> protein expression was also seen in all six breast cancer cell lines. this is the first report of girk protein in breast cancer cells. we previously first reported girk <dig> protein was seen in the three small cell lung cancer  cell lines that express girk <dig> mrna, and determined girk <dig> protein was not expressed in non-sclc cell lines  <cit> . the present data also indicates that expression of girk channels varies during long-term growth of the cells in culture. this data would correlate with previous data indicating that expression of girk <dig> was associated with a more aggressive clinical behavior  <cit> .

alcohol is an established risk factor for breast cancer , but little is known of its mechanism of action. although treatment of mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells with ethanol increased erk1/ <dig> activities and resulted in subsequent increased cell growth  <cit> , no effects of ethanol on girk channels in breast cancer have been previously reported in the literature. to determine functionality of the three girk channels, mda-mb- <dig> cells were treated with ethanol, which has been found to open girk channels in both the heart and brain  <cit> . since the predominant girk heterotetramers seem to be girk1/ <dig> and girk1/ <dig> , we concentrated on girk <dig>  girk <dig>  and girk <dig> expression in these cells. girk <dig>  girk <dig>  and girk <dig> protein expression was decreased by ethanol treatment. we feel that the data indicates that some of the effects of ethanol in breast cancer may be mediated by girk channels. further research is needed to determine whether girk1/ <dig> or girk1/ <dig> is the predominant heterotetramer in breast cancer. no differences were previously seen between brain-type girk1/ <dig> channels and cardiac-type girk1/ <dig> channels in their responses to ethanol treatment  <cit> , and these studies involved girk1/ <dig> and girk1/ <dig> transfected into xenopus oocytes, an artificial system. it is our hypothesis that the predominant heterotetramer in mda-mb- <dig> breast cancer cells is girk1/ <dig>  since we see variable expression of girk <dig> in this cell line.

in our study, girk <dig> was seen at two different molecular weights in breast cancer cell lines. the higher mw  is indicated on the antibody data sheet. in sclc cell lines, we saw expression only at  <dig> kda  <cit> . we believe that the immuno-precipitation studies likely prove that the lower mw protein is girk <dig>  in addition, ethanol decreased girk <dig> expression at both mws. furthermore, protein levels of girk <dig> were increased at the lower mw after overexpression of girk <dig> by transfection studies. this data indicates that girk <dig> protein is also expressed at a lower mw in breast cancer cells, a key difference from our data on small cell lung cancer  <cit> . we believe some of this change in mw may be due to long-term growth of the breast cancer cells in culture also indicating why there is a difference between the mws in figure  <dig> and figure  <dig> 

it is our contention that the lower mw protein in these gels is girk <dig> and all the data confirm this lower mw. in the research, we used two different girk <dig> antibodies, and the lower mw band appeared in the gels using both antibodies. according to the manufacturer's data sheet  the antibody used in figure  <dig> corresponded to amino acids 6– <dig> of rat girk <dig>  as per the manufacturer's data sheet , the antibody used in figures 4– <dig> was raised against a peptide within an internal region of human girk <dig>  since these two antibodies map different regions, we believe it is unlikely that this is an artifact. in addition, previous work from our laboratory indicated the upstate antibody only appeared at the higher mw in sclc cell lines  <cit> . it is also possible that this lower mw was a degradation product of girk <dig>  but we think this is unlikely because the same protein samples were used for determining girk <dig> and girk <dig> protein expression, and these samples showed no differences in mw. it is our hypothesis that this lower mw is a splice variant of girk <dig>  since splice variants with truncated versions of girk <dig> have been previously reported  <cit> . further research is needed in order to confirm this hypothesis.

girk <dig> protein expression was increased by transfection of girk <dig> and girk <dig> plasmids: however, mrna expression of girk <dig> was decreased by transfection of either girk <dig> or girk <dig>  we believe that the increase in girk proteins negatively regulates girk <dig> gene expression. it is also our contention that this transfection data confirms previous work indicating girk <dig> is overexpressed in cancer cells  <cit> . in support of this theory, in the present studies, transfection of girk <dig> leads to an increase in girk <dig> mrna levels. in addition, sf media decreased girk <dig> expression. we believe that this change is due to lack of estrogen in the media. this is confirmed by our data with charcoal-stripped serum and estradiol. previous investigators have indicated 17-β-estradiol can modulate girk channel activation in the brain, and this modulation is blocked by protein kinase a and protein kinase c inhibitors  <cit> . it is our contention that effects of some risk factors for breast cancer, such as estrogen and ethanol, can be mediated by girk channels.

CONCLUSIONS
our data indicate that functional girk channels that are involved in cellular signaling exist in breast cancer cells. serum free media  inhibited girk <dig> protein expression, possibly due to lack of k+ ions or estrogen. these data indicate that the girk channels are functional and an integral part of the intra-cellular signaling in breast cancer.
