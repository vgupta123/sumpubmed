BACKGROUND
toxic metal contamination to foods causes major global health problems. humans are exposed to toxic metals primarily from air, water, and food
 <cit> . pollution of foods with environmental toxic metals even in trace quantities has attracted considerable attention in the global era with rapid transportation. the simple and inexpensive monitoring of food pollution needs to be developed for reducing or eliminating the amounts of toxic elements into the environment. milk and milk products provide good quality nutrients necessary for a strong healthy body and mind, and act as a primary source of nutrients in diets all around the world
 <cit> . however, the presence of toxic elements in milk and milk products may create health problems especially for infants, school age children, and old people who consume large quantity of those products. their presence in milk and its products is caused by different agricultural activities. irrigation with toxic metal-contaminated water and use of pesticides, parasiticides, drugs, and environmental disinfectants to cows may result in toxic metal contamination in feeds
 <cit> , meat, and milk
 <cit> . as the mammary glands are the most physiologically sensitive part of dairy cows, the input and output of toxic metals in these organisms are clearly reflected in the milk
 <cit> . heavy metals, specially cadmium, arsenic, zinc, and lead, are ubiquitously found in nature and, therefore, their contamination to milk and milk products must be considered
 <cit> . among these toxic metals, zinc is the most abundant one
 <cit>  and provided to humans. although an adequate amount of zinc is physiologically important, exposure to the excess amount is harmful and toxic aspects of zinc arise
 <cit> . therefore, it becomes consumers’ benefits to monitor whether the zinc concentration in milk or milk products is adequate or not.

analytical methods towards hazardous chemical compounds in environments and foods have attracted much attention. flame atomic absorption spectrometry , electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry , inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy , inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry , hydride generation coupled with atomic absorption spectroscopy  or atomic fluorescence spectroscopy , x-ray spectroscopy, spectrofluorimetry, spectrophotometry, and electroanalytical techniques have been commonly used for determination and quantification of metals
 <cit> . however, such standard methods require expensive and bulky laboratory equipments, analytical expertise and sample transportation, and generate hazardous wastes
 <cit> . expensive and bulky hg-aas and hg-afs have limits of detection  in the microgram per kilogram range
 <cit>  although icp-aes sensitivity can be improved by coupling to hg. under certain circumstances, sensing approaches with low cost can compete with traditional analyses in south-east asia where contaminations by massive arsenic or other heavy metals in water or foods occur. in this sense, biosensors that measure bioavailable fractions of toxic metal ion have attracted much attention. to compensate the weaknesses of traditional methods, the biosensors that can detect as  and cd /pb /zn  in water have been developed using the trans factors/cis elements, arsr/ars promoter−ars operator  and cadc/cad promoter−cad operator 
 <cit> . arsr, encoded by arsr, binds exclusively to either pars−oars or as , and cadc, encoded by cadc, binds to either pcad−ocad or cd . the simple, inexpensive, and sensitive analysis of toxic metals in water was achieved by fusing arsr or cadc to green fluorescent protein . however, although different types of gfp-tagged biosensors have been developed for on-site determination of toxic metals in drinking water and soil extracts
 <cit> , these biosensors have not been tested for foods. therefore, it remains unknown in milk and milk products whether these recombinant proteins keep their binding capabilities to metals or dna and what amounts of toxic metals are quantified with previously established methods.

the aims of this study are to investigate responsiveness of trans factors that can bind to toxic metals or dna in whole composition of cow’s milk and yoghurt as well as in whey fractions and to develop simple methods for determination of toxic metals in the dairy products by application of the gfp-tagged trans factors and immobilized cis elements.

RESULTS
arsr-gfp responds to externally added as 
only inorganic as  resulted in a decrease of fluorescence and no responses to inorganic as  and the organic forms of as such as methylarsonic acid, cacodylic acid, and arsenobetaine were observed
 <cit> . arsenic concentrations in milk were low and mostly in the form of trivalent inorganic arsenic
 <cit> . therefore, inorganic as  was taken under consideration in this study. whole milk and yoghurt, to which as  was externally added, were fluorometrically tested with the assay using the separately prepared biosensor. the fluorescence response of arsr-gfp to the as  within  <dig> min was analyzed in milk  and yoghurt  with a microplate fluororeader  and a portable fluorometer . the results showed that fluorescence was significantly decreased at as  concentrations of 10– <dig> μg/l in milk and 10– <dig> μg/kg in yoghurt. the lods for as  were determined to be  <dig> μg/l in milk and  <dig> μg/kg in yoghurt. the fluorescence intensities were linearly decreased with the increase in as  concentrations in milk   and yoghurt  . using the separately prepared biosensors, the same lods and working range for as  externally added to milk and yoghurt were reproduced . in measurement by et-aas, however, non-linearities were obtained between the as  concentrations added to milk or yoghurt and the absorbance values. only  <dig> μg/kg as  was detected by et-aas . the result shows that the specific protein-dna and protein-metalloid interactions can be applied to quantification of the lower concentrations of as  in whole milk and yoghurt in comparison with et-aas.

1et-aas and icp-aes were used for measurement of externally added as /cd  and intrinsic zn , respectively.

cadc-gfp responds to externally added cd  but not to externally added pb 
whole milk and yoghurt, to which cd  or pb  was externally added, were also tested with the separately prepared biosensor. responses of cadc-gfp were analyzed in whole milk and yoghurt using a fluororeader and a portable fluorometer. cadc-gfp responded to cd  dose-dependently at concentrations of 5– <dig> μg/l in whole milk and 5– <dig> μg/kg in whole yoghurt when the fluorescence was measured by fluororeader and fluorometer . the lods were  <dig> μg/l in whole milk and  <dig> μg/kg in whole yoghurt. the fluorescence was linearly decreased with the increase in cd  concentrations in milk   and yoghurt  . in measurement by et-aas, the linearity was obtained within a range of 0– <dig> μg/kg for milk  and yoghurt  . the result shows that although the lower linearity is disadvantageous, almost same performance in terms of lod as in et-aas is available in the fluorescent bioassay for cd  in milk and yoghurt. using the separately prepared biosensors, the same lods and working range for cd  in milk and yoghurt were reproduced . on the other hand, the fluorescent intensity of cadc-gfp significantly decreased at  <dig> μg/l pb  in milk and  <dig> μg/kg pb  in yoghurt. however, lower reduction of fluorescence intensity and lower linearity of the response were found within the tested range . therefore, cadc-gfp might not be suitable for measurement of pb  using whole products. the fluorescence decreases at each concentration were more marked in cd  than in pb  in the assays.

cadc-gfp responds to zn  extracted into whey fractions but not to zn  in whole composition
whole milk and yoghurt, to which zn  was externally added, were tested with the separately prepared biosensor. the significant responses of cadc-gfp to externally added zn  were observed at  <dig> μg/l for whole milk  and  <dig> or  <dig> μg/kg for whole yoghurt . the linearity was obtained within a range of 5– <dig> μg/l for milk  and within a range of 5– <dig> μg/kg for yoghurt . however, as observed in the fluorescence responses to externally added pb , low reduction of fluorescence intensity was found in response to externally added zn  concentrations in milk and yoghurt. it has been reported that zinc in milk usually binds to the low molecular weight ligands as citrate and amino acids, and to proteins such as casein, α-lactalbumin, and lactoferrin
 <cit> . it was expected that externally added pb  or zn  in whole milk and yoghurt might bind to the low molecular weight ligands or the milk proteins strongly. it has been reported that lowering ph of cow’s milk changed zinc and protein distribution and resulted in the shift of zinc from pellet  to whey
 <cit> . therefore, pre-treatments for milk and yoghurt were considered. firstly, ph of whole milk was lowered to  <dig>  or below to change zinc and protein distribution and extract zinc from pellet into whey. secondly, in order to reduce concentrations of substances in the whey fractions of yoghurt or acid-treated milk, 100-times dilution was performed with sterilized ultrapure water. the previous analysis concerning the cadc-gfp specificity revealed the enhancement of its background fluorescence by ca
 <cit> . milk or yoghurt usually contains abundant elements such as ca, p, mg, na, and zn. therefore, an excess amount of ca   was externally added to zn  standard solutions so that the effect of intrinsic ca  in the diluted whey fractions on the background fluorescence was eliminated. the ph of standard solutions was adjusted to an average ph of tested whey fractions. fluorescence intensities of cadc-gfp bound to pcad−ocad after incubation with whey fractions from different brands of milk  and yoghurt  were measured using a portable fluorometer. the fluorescence intensities decreased in the separately prepared biosensor with increasing concentration of zn  in the standard solutions . this can be explained by an assumption that, in this assay, the fluorescence arises from the cadc-gfp associated with pcad−ocad and the association constant between cadc-gfp and pcad−ocad decreases in the presence of zn . besides this, cadc-gfp also responded to whey fractions derived from different brands of milk  and yoghurt  using the solid phase biosensor. fluorescence intensities increased in response to zn  in the standard solutions . in this assay, the fluorescence arises from the cadc-gfp dissociated from pcad−ocad and the dissociation constant between cadc-gfp and pcad−ocad might increase in response to zn 
 <cit> . measurement of zn  concentrations in the whey fractions was repeated in different batches . the concentrations of different brand of milk and yoghurt determined using the separately prepared biosensor varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/l and  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/kg, respectively. when those were determined using the solid phase biosensor,  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/l for milk and  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/kg for yoghurt were obtained. these zn  concentrations overlapped with the reported ranges of zinc content, which varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg/g in raw bovine milk
 <cit>  and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg/g in yoghurt
 <cit> . the result suggests that the pre-treatments and fluorescence measurements are adequate and reproducible in determination of zn  concentrations.

correlation between zinc contents measured with the bioassays and icp-aes
the zn  contents were determined towards the whey fractions in the bioassays. in order to evaluate whether or not the bioassays are available as simple and on-site protocols to measure zinc content in milk or yoghurt, zinc in whole milk or yoghurt was quantified with a standard protocol, icp-aes. then, correlations between the zn  contents in whey fractions and the zinc contents in whole products were evaluated. positive and linear correlations were found in the separately prepared biosensor for milk  and yoghurt . when bioassay was performed using the solid phase biosensor, the correlation coefficients for milk and yoghurt were smaller than those obtained with the separately prepared biosensor . although, the data obtained with biosensor and icp-aes were not highly correlated, those were plotted within narrow concentration ranges of  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/l or mg/kg for milk and  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/kg for yoghurt. therefore, both types of biosensor could detect an unexpected or abnormal value in routine monitoring of zn  for milk and yoghurt with a simple protocol and a handheld device.

discussion
the bioassays to quantify toxic metals can even compensate with expensive instrumental analyses such as aas, icp, and afs. for traditional analytical techniques such as icp-aes and et-aas, dry mineralization or microwave-induced combustion methods are generally essential for quantitative extraction of toxic metals from samples. contrary to necessity of these time-consuming pre-treatments, toxic metals in milk and yoghurt could be measured directly or only with preparation of whey and dilution in the fluorescent bioassays. the simple pre-treatment for the fluorescent bioassays was required to prepare transparent samples because the samples were loaded into the solid phase biosensors and provided directly to fluorescence measurement. it has been reported that casein was precipitated at ph  <dig>  and about 90% of the zinc content and 95% of the citrate content identified as zinc citrate were released into the whey fraction
 <cit> . this knowledge supports the results obtained in this study that zinc concentrations in whey fractions measured by biosensors correlated with those in whole milk measured by icp-aes. the analytical performances of the biosensors, icp-aes, and et-aas were summarized . the reported ranges of arsenic, cadmium, and zinc are  <dig> - <dig> ,  <dig> - <dig> , and  <dig> - <dig>  mg/kg in milk, and  <dig> - <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  mg/kg in yoghurt
 <cit> . using the bioassays developed in this study,  <dig> - <dig>  mg/kg as ,  <dig> - <dig>  mg/kg cd  could be quantified in milk and yoghurt. the ranges of  <dig> - <dig>  mg/l of intrinsic zn  in milk and  <dig> - <dig>  mg/kg for yoghurt were determined using commercially available brands. therefore, it is likely that the biosensors harbour practically available ranges of detection for as , cd , and zn .

the gfp-tagged trans factors responded to several metals and metalloids. among these elements, the responses and sensitivities to sb  were lower than those to other toxic metals
 <cit> . pb  or zn  in whole milk and yoghurt bound to the low molecular weight ligands or the milk proteins strongly so that cadc-gfp could not respond to these metals sufficiently. therefore, specificity to as  or cd  in the direct bioassay using whole milk and yoghurt would be expected. it has been reported that, among heterogeneous elements generally contained in milk and yoghurt, ca  and mg  affected fluorescence intensity of arsr-gfp and cadc-gfp
 <cit> . therefore, it remains to be clarified before practical use whether the fluorescence intensity is affected by ca  and mg  when as  or cd  would be quantified directly using whole milk and yoghurt. it is also important to prepare standard solution or whole product that could control fluorescence intensity as a background.

the toxic metal biosensors have been developed based on interactions between gfp-tagged trans factors and immobilized cis elements. in addition to the biosensors composed of protein and dna, a large number of recombinant whole-cell sensors that utilize the sensitivity and selectivity of trans factors have been reported. practical advantages of such biosensor in respect of portability, cost, and manipulation were shown in monitoring drinking and environmental water when it was compared to conventional analytical instruments. however, recombinant whole-cell sensors that could work under nutrient-rich and not defined conditions, as in milk and yoghurt, had not been established. it is expected that whole-cell sensors that can detect zn  in nutrient-poor water might not work in milk and dairy products because carbon sources and other nutrients must affect their metabolisms and cell growth. even though conventional analytical instruments would be used, extraction techniques of zinc from milk and dairy products will be required prior to measurement as shown previously
 <cit> . considering such complexity, it is quite advantageous that the elements of biosensor can work in the whole products towards as  and cd  as well as in the whey fractions obtained with extraction towards zn . the isolation of trans factors and cis elements from bacterial cells enabled application of transcriptional switches to sensing toxic metals in the dairy products. to our knowledge, the assays developed in this study are the first one that could quantify toxic metals in milk and yoghurt using biosensing elements.

CONCLUSIONS
interactions between gfp-tagged trans factor and cis element could be effectively applied to measurement of as , cd , and zn  in milk or yoghurt. fluorescence intensities obtained with the separately prepared biosensors, which arose from the associated protein, decreased significantly with increasing concentrations of the toxic metals, whereas fluorescence intensities with the solid phase biosensors, which arose from the dissociated protein, increased in response to zn . the gfp-tagged proteins were able to respond to as  within ranges of 10– <dig> μg/l in milk and 10– <dig> μg/kg in yoghurt and cd  within ranges of 5– <dig> μg/l in milk and 5– <dig> μg/kg in yoghurt. however, lower reduction of fluorescence response was obtained towards pb  and zn . therefore, the optimized pre-treatments, which were lowering ph and 100-times dilution of the obtained whey fractions, were important for measuring zn  in milk and yoghurt. positive correlations were found between zn  determined with the separately prepared biosensor or solid phase biosensor and total zinc determined with icp-aes. thus, the interaction between trans factor and cis element could be utilized to simple quantification of toxic metals in milk and yoghurt that protects us from excessive and chronic exposure to them.
