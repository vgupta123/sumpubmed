BACKGROUND
basic-helix-loop-helix  transcription factors are central to neurogenesis in metazoans  <cit> . the most well known role for such factors in neurogenesis is the so-called 'proneural' function. this function underlies the commitment of neuroectodermal cells to a neural fate, and the term comes originally from the study of proneural genes in drosophila. in this organism, proneural genes include atonal , amos, scute , and achaete  which are required for the specification of sense organ precursors  of the peripheral nervous system  <cit> . in mutations of these genes, specific subsets of sops fail to be formed. for instance, ato is required for the formation of sops of chordotonal  proprioceptive sensory organs  <cit> .

other members of the bhlh protein family are expressed after neural commitment and play a variety of roles in neural cells leading up to neural differentiation. this is particularly apparent in vertebrates, where for instance the factors neurom and neurod are required for neuronal migration and differentiation respectively  <cit> . in drosophila, such 'downstream' neural bhlh factors are represented by asense , cousin of atonal , deadpan  and target of poxn . these genes are related to sc, ato, hairy/e and neurogenin respectively. ase, cato and dpn are widely expressed in developing neurons  <cit> , whereas tap expression is confined to a small subset of sensory neurons  <cit> . the functions of these genes are less well known compared with proneural genes. ase is expressed in all neural precursors of both the cns and pns  <cit> . mutations of ase result in reduced viability but mutant embryos exhibit only subtle pns defects  <cit> . in the larval optic lobes, ase participates in the control of mitotic activity in neural precursors  <cit> . in this process, ase limits proliferation by antagonising dpn. in turn, dpn antagonises dacapo   <cit> . dap encodes a p <dig> cyclin-dependent kinase  inhibitor that is expressed transiently in cells prior to their terminal cell division in order to prevent further divisions  <cit> .

unlike ase and dpn, the expression of cato is confined to the developing pns, where it was reported to be expressed in all sops and their progeny  <cit> . the function of cato is poorly known. examination of embryos bearing large deficiencies of the cato region suggested a role in sensory neuron differentiation  <cit> . we report here the generation and analysis of specific cato mutations. flies homozygous for cato loss-of-function mutations are viable. mutant embryos show no gross neuronal differentiation defects, but have a defect in cell proliferation within the ch sensory lineages. combination of cato mutation with those of ato and ase reveals a second role for cato in the maintenance of ch sop fate or survival.

RESULTS
expression of cato differs in ato/amos and sc lineages
it was previously reported that cato mrna was initially activated in ch sops, and subsequently it appeared to be expressed generally in all cells of the sensory pns  cells)  <cit> . an anti-cato antibody confirms and extends these findings. expression of cato protein was assessed relative to other markers of early sensory neurogenesis. these include: amos, which marks the amos-dependent dorsal bipolar dendrite  and dorsal multidendritic  <dig>  neural precursors  <cit> ; ato, which marks all ch precursors as well as the dbd and dmd <dig> cells  <cit> ; and ase and senseless , which mark all sops and their progeny  <cit> . cato protein is initially detectable at stage  <dig> in the first ato-dependent ch sop , followed shortly by the first amos-dependent precursor, dbd . at this stage it is not expressed in the so-called 'a' cell, which is the first es sop to appear . shortly after, it is expressed in further ch sops and also in a cell presumed to be the second amos-dependent precursor, dmd <dig>  <cit>  . at this stage, cato is still not expressed in es cells, although numerous es cells are detectable by ase and sens expression . eventually, at late stage 11/stage  <dig>  cato is detectable in the progeny of most sops, including es cells, and overlaps extensively but not completely with ase and sens . in ato mutant embryos, cato expression is reduced, consistent with loss of most ch precursors . however, expression remains in the amos-dependent cells. it also remains in the c <dig> cell, consistent with the observation that this ch precursor usually appears even in the absence of ato function  <cit>  . in summary, cato is first expressed in ato- and amos-dependent sops. in contrast, it is not expressed in sc-dependent es cells until after the first division of the sops. this difference in expression between the two sensory lineages was also observed in imaginal discs .

cato protein expression persists in sensory lineages until terminal differentiation. expression ceases only after the beginning of terminal differentiation, since there is substantial co-expression of cato and elav, a terminal differentiation marker . the latest expression appears to mark a specific subset of cells that only partially overlaps with the expression of ase and sens . this later expression is recapitulated by a gfp reporter gene construct driven by the genomic region upstream of cato, which contains enhancers for the entire cato expression pattern . between stages  <dig> and  <dig>  gfp expression reflects that of endogenous cato . in ch lineages, gfp perdures strongly into neuron, scolopale and ligament cells, but only weakly in cap and attachment cells . this suggests that whilst cato expression begins in the ch sops, it is subsequently maintained preferentially in daughter piib and then piiib - the intermediate precursors leading to the neuronal branch of the sense organ lineage  <cit> . expression also perdures in the dbd neuron and its glial sib, in one of the v'td neurons, and in a possible peripheral glia cell . in es organs, gfp is only weakly expressed in general. however, it perdures strongest in most of the multidendritic  neurons that derive from es lineages  . this suggests that the late expression of cato protein noted above is mostly associated with ch and md neurons.

evidence that cato is directly regulated by ato and amos but only indirectly regulated by sc
cato is expressed in ato- and amos-dependent sops, where its expression overlaps that of ato and amos . in contrast, cato is not expressed until later in the progeny of sc-dependent es sops. sc expression in es sops is transient: it is downregulated before sop division  <cit> . cato expression does not begin until after this time. it therefore appears that cato expression does not overlap with that of sc in the es lineage. consistent with this, at stage  <dig> es cells express the direct sc targets, ase and sens, but not cato . moreover, cato expression does not overlap with the expression of the proneural gene, ac, which is thought to be coexpressed with sc  <cit>  . therefore, as a proneural target gene, cato may be directly regulated by ato and amos but only indirectly regulated by sc.

to investigate this, we identified the cis-regulatory elements of cato . a  <dig> -kb genomic dna fragment upstream of the cato transcription unit supports gfp reporter expression in a pattern closely resembling that of the endogenous gene. that is, expression is observed initially in ch cells and later in all pns cells . examination of the sequence of the  <dig> -kb region revealed the presence of several e box motifs that resemble the previously identified ato-specific dna binding site  <cit> . when two of these eato boxes were mutated, the early expression of gfp in ch cells was abolished but later es/md cell expression was unaffected . subsequently, we found that the  <dig> -kb fragment could be subdivided into at least two enhancers, one that supports early expression in ato- and amos-dependent cells  and one that shows late expression in es/md cells . the former contains the two eato sites identified above. mutation of both sites or of the e <dig> site alone in cato2a resulted in loss of gfp expression in ch cells . it is notable that the e <dig> site is well conserved in drosophila pseudoobscura  whereas the e <dig> site differs markedly in the nucleotides flanking the core e box . thus, it is highly likely that ato directly regulates cato via the e <dig> binding site in the 2a enhancer. in contrast, cato is activated only indirectly by sc in es lineages. the identity of the factor directly activating cato in es lineages remains unknown, but it would presumably bind to the 2b enhancer .

the early ch enhancer is also expressed in the amos-dependent dbd and dmd <dig> cells . these cells express both amos and ato, with the expression of ato dependent on that of amos  <cit> . thus, cato could be a direct target of amos, or an indirect target via activation of ato. we find, however, that cato expression is not affected in these cells by the loss of ato function . in contrast, this expression is absent in amos mutant embryos . moreover, expression in amos-dependent cells is also absent when the e <dig> site is mutated . we conclude that cato is likely to be directly activated by both ato  and amos  via the same e box binding site . this is the first identified direct target gene of amos.

cato mutation does not cause lethality
the fly stock, kg <dig>  contains a p-element insertion about  <dig>  kb upstream of cato . to generate cato mutations, we mobilised the p-element to create imprecise excisions extending in the direction of the cato gene. two deletions were generated named cato <dig> and cato <dig> . cato <dig> is a protein null: the deletion removes the cato orf and no cato expression is apparent in homozygous cato <dig> embryos . cato <dig> deletes the cato upstream region but does not affect the transcription unit. homozygous embryos show very little protein expression, particularly in the trunk . this is consistent with the loss of the major regulatory elements upstream of cato. both mutations are viable, with little sign of gross defects. adult flies appear normal and active. thus, cato does not appear to play an essential role in gross neurogenesis.

cato mutant embryos exhibit duplicated chordotonal neurons
embryos homozygous for either cato mutation show a near normal arrangement of sensory neurons and support cells, as judged by mab22c <dig> and anti-cpo staining . there is no clear evidence of differentiation or axon defects, in contrast to the phenotypes proposed previously based on the examination of chromosomal deficiencies  <cit> . a defect was observed, however, in the number of ch neurons: embryos homozygous for either cato mutation exhibit frequent duplications of ch neurons . for cato <dig> mutant embryos, the v'ch <dig> neuron is duplicated in  <dig> % of abdominal segments . of these, very few  seem to be associated with duplicated scolopale cells with the remainder having a single scolopale cell . cap cells are more difficult to identify with certainty, but in at least the majority of cases a single cap cell could clearly be associated with the duplicated neuron . given this general lack of change in support cell numbers, we conclude that the duplicated neuron most likely results from a defect in cell division number rather than a disruption of asymmetric cell division or an increase in sop formation . ch neuron duplication is also seen for the vcha and vchb neurons, but only rarely for the lch <dig> neurons. similar levels of neuronal duplication were observed in cato <dig> mutant embryos, and the phenotype is present in embryos expressing a cato rnai construct , thus ruling out the possibility that it results from an effect of the deletion on the adjacent gene, cg <dig> 

we explored this neuronal duplication defect by looking for interaction with other genes involved in regulating the number of cell divisions that pns neural precursors undergo. cyclin a is known to be required for sop cell divisions and it has been proposed that proneural factors regulate its expression by binding to an element in its first intron  <cit> . loss of one copy of the cyclin a gene resulted in suppression of ch neuronal duplication in cato homozygote embryos . this finding supports the conclusion that cato mutants exhibit a specific proliferation defect in ch neuronal lineages. dap encodes a cdk inhibitor that is required in the epidermis and cns to terminate cell divisions at the appropriate time  <cit> . in dap mutants, cells typically undergo one extra round of division. we found that this is true for the pns too: extra sensory neurons are present in dap <dig> homozygous mutant embryos . interestingly, not all sensory neurons are equally affected: the dap mutant phenotype closely resembles that of cato in that duplication appears most apparent for ch neurons. in addition, dap/cato double homozygotes do not appear greatly different from either single mutant , suggesting that both genes function in the same pathway.

cato expression was shown above to persist particularly in type ii md neurons. these do not appear duplicated. most of these are dendritic arborisation  neurons that have elaborately branched dendrites extending beneath the larval cuticle. we investigated whether differentiated da neurons showed morphological defects in cato mutants by examining dendrite branching patterns in third instar larvae. da neuronal dendrites were detected using 22c <dig>  or gal4447/uas-mcd8-gfp . however, analysis showed no clear defects in the pattern or extent of branching of da neuron dendrites .

redundancy between cato and ato in c <dig> precursor development
in ato mutant embryos almost all ch neurons are missing, but one neuron of the abdominal lch <dig> cluster usually still develops  <cit> . this is the anterior-most neuron of the cluster  and it arises from c <dig>  the first ch sop to appear. cato expression in c <dig> persists in ato mutant embryos . therefore, although cato mutants do not exhibit loss of lch <dig> neurons , we speculated that cato might be responsible for c <dig> formation in the absence of ato function. to test this, we determined whether the lch5a neurons that remain in ato mutant embryos require cato function. in ato <dig> homozygotes,  <dig> % of abdominal segments contained an lch <dig> neuron  . in cato536; ato <dig> double homozygotes, however, the presence of this neuron is strongly reduced : only 5% of segments contained a possible lch <dig> neuron . thus, c <dig>  can develop when either ato or cato are functional, suggesting at least some redundancy in their function for this cell.

ase and cato cooperate in lch <dig> development
like cato, ase is expressed after sop selection. ase has roles downstream of sop selection, but its phenotype in sensory lineages is mild considering its wide expression pattern <cit> . one phenotype observed in ase <dig> mutant embryos at a low frequency is the loss of one chordotonal organ from the lateral cluster of five organs ; 7% segments showing defect; n =  <dig> segments). we observed that the frequency of this lch phenotype is greatly enhanced in ase <dig> mutant embryos with one copy of cato <dig> ) . since support cells are missing in addition to the neuron, it appears that this phenotype results from an early defect in some ch sops and is not linked to the later neuronal duplication defect of cato described above.

discussion
although cato is a pns-specific gene, its expression and function appear to be different in distinct lineages of the pns. its expression begins in ch precursors just after their formation, but appears much later in es lineages. correlating with this pattern, we found that cato is directly regulated by ato in ch sops but it is not a direct target of sc in es sops. this expression pattern, and its underlying regulation, appears to be characteristic of a number of genes, including the transcription factor rfx and a number of its targets . we refer to the pattern as 'ch-enriched' and suggest that such genes mediate part of ato's subtype specificity in neurogenesis. interestingly, in different sensory lineages, it seems that cato is regulated by amos and ato through the same e box binding site.

the functions we have characterised for cato relate to its major site of expression: the ch organs. the most obvious defect in cato mutant embryos involves supernumerary cell divisions in the neuronal branch of ch lineages. this is reminiscent of the known roles of the other non-proneural bhlh proteins, dpn and ase. thus, in the larval optic lobe, dpn expression maintains proliferation, whilst ase promotes cell cycle exit and neuronal differentiation  <cit> . the function of cato and ase in limiting cell division resembles the well-known function of vertebrate proneural-like bhlh factors in promoting the cell cycle exit of neuronal progenitors as a prelude to differentiation. this is opposed by hes factors , which maintain proliferation  <cit> .

in the case of the larval optic lobe, ase functions in part via the cdk inhibitor, dap  <cit> . dap itself is generally required for cells to terminate cell division appropriately and cells generally undergo one extra division in dap mutants  <cit> . dap expression is highly dynamic in embryos  <cit> , and it appears that a pulse of dap expression helps to ensure the timely shut down of cyclin function for appropriate cell cycle exit. we show here that dap is similarly required for ch neurons. moreover, the pns phenotype of dap mutant embryos is strikingly similar to that of cato. this suggests that cato regulates dap in ch neurons. genetic analysis suggests this might be so, but we see no clear change in dap expression in cato mutant embryos . however, the complex and highly dynamic expression of dap may make small lineage-specific changes in expression difficult to detect. the idea that cato might regulate dap is consistent with previous observations that dap is under the control of multiple developmental regulators rather than of cell cycle regulators themselves  <cit> , and also that dap is regulated by ato in the developing eye  <cit> . dap is one of several cell cycle regulators  that have complex modular cis-regulatory regions. it is notable that cato appears to regulate only the division of the neuron and not support cells. we speculate that this division may require independent regulation from those of the support cells, because the number of neurons within a ch organ varies in different locations, presumably as a result of extra neuronal cell divisions. for instance, some ch organs in the adult femur have two neurons, whilst ch organs in the antenna have three neurons  <cit> .

the other functions detected for cato appear to be unrelated to the neuronal duplication function and show at least some redundancy with other bhlh regulators . in both these cases we suggest that cato plays a partially redundant role in maintaining sop fate. in the absence of ase and cato, some ch sops fail to form scolopidia. a similar situation applies to c <dig> in the absence of ato and cato. the apparent redundancy between ato and cato suggests that c <dig> sop can form via alternative routes involving ato and cato . however, cato is expressed too late to be a proneural gene, and so another factor must supply the proneural function in the absence of ato. it seems likely that this factor is sc, which is expressed in c <dig> despite being the es proneural gene  <cit> . embryos with a mutation of the achaete-scute complex often show one missing scolopidium in the lch <dig> cluster  <cit> , while as-c/ato mutant embryos have no ch cells at all. such interchangeability of proneural functions between ato and sc is surprising since sc does not generally have the capacity to direct ch subtype specification, as shown in misexpression experiments  <cit> . in contrast, ato's subtype specificity function is reflected in its ability to convert es sops to a ch fate  <cit> . we suggest that expression of cato in a sc-dependent c <dig> cell may provide sufficient subtype determination information when ato is absent. it is not clear why such a complicated exception should have arisen. one possibility is that c <dig> forms a unique neuronal type among ch organs. certainly there are a number of genes that are only expressed in, or are only absent from, this one neuron. for instance, mab49c <dig> detects an antigen that is expressed in all lch <dig> neurons except lch5a  <cit> . moreover, c <dig> appears to be functionally unique in that it acts to induce surrounding cells to differentiate as oenocytes via egfr signalling  <cit> . this function of c <dig> appears to be 'rescued' by cato function, since the c <dig> cells present in ato mutants are able to recruit oenocytes  <cit> .

expression of cato in es lineages appears to be mainly as a prelude to late expression in the md/da neurons that derive from both es and ch lineages. as yet, no function has been discerned for this late expression, but we speculate that cato mutant larvae may exhibit a physiological defect in da neurons, which are thought to be required for nociception and thermoreception  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
characterisation of the first mutations for cato has revealed roles in maintenance and cell division in ch lineages. these roles are relatively subtle considering that cato is expressed widely in the developing pns. moreover, cato orthologues can be readily recognised among drosophila species and other diptera , suggesting strong conservation. it is possible that further functions remain to be uncovered, perhaps in da neuron physiology or in the complex cephalic sense organs.
