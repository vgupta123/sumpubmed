BACKGROUND
canine distemper virus  is a single-stranded, negative-sense, nonsegmented rna virus of genus morbillivirus within the family paramyxoviridae. cdv is a highly contagious pathogen that can cause disease with high morbidity and mortality in immunologically naive hosts as a result of viral tropism for the cutaneous, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and central and peripheral nervous systems  <cit> . cdv has a broad host range and primarily affects animals belonging to the canidae  and mustelidae  families . previous studies had implicated cdv in the pathogenesis of paget’s disease  <cit> , and natural cdv infection of non-human primates has been reported . in  <dig>  a cdv outbreak occurred in rhesus monkeys  at a breeding farm in guangxi province, china, with a morbidity rate  and a mortality rate , unexpectedly  <cit> . two additional cd occurred in monkeys were reported in  <dig>  one occurred in rhesus monkeys at a laboratory animal center in beijing with a reported 60 %  mortality  <cit> , another occurred in japan following the importation of cynomolgus monkeys  from china and was associated with a  <dig>  %  mortality  <cit> .

host cell infection initiates with viral binding to receptor proteins on the surface of cells. the cdv viral envelope contains two integral glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin  protein and fusion  protein. the h protein mediates the binding of the virus to the cell membrane, and the f protein serves to fuse viral and host membranes, thereby enabling release of the viral contents into the cytoplasm  <cit> . the cdv-h glycoprotein mediates viral attachment through specific interactions with signaling lymphocyte activation molecule   <cit>  or nectin- <dig> cellular receptors  <cit> . slam is expressed on a subset of immune cells, while nectin- <dig> is expressed on epithelial cells of various organs. although slam is a main receptor for morbilliviruses, each morbillivirus preferentially uses the slam of its host animals, as the specific residues within slam responsible for mediating interactions with the cdv-h protein can vary by species  <cit> . the specificity of the cdv-h protein for the slam receptor imposes species barriers and is partly responsible for restricting cdv host range  <cit> . nectin- <dig> is highly conserved among different animals  <cit> . unlike the slam receptor, the characteristics of binding between nectin- <dig> and cdv were unknown. in this study, we evaluated the replication capacity of a cdv isolate obtained from a naturally infected monkey on vero cells expressing dog, monkey, or human slam receptor proteins to better understand how cdv-h protein receptor specificity affects host range restriction.

RESULTS
surface expression of dog, monkey, and human slam on vero cells
vero cells were transfected with expression plasmids to express the dog, monkey, or human version of the slam protein. the expression plasmids included an ha epitope tag to allow confirmation of the surface expression of the slam protein. after cells stably transfected with g <dig> had been selected, slam expression was examined by flow cytometry using an ha tag-specific monoclonal antibody. the results showed that dog, monkey, and human slam was expressed equally on the surface of the resulting cell lines  but not on the empty vector-transfected vero cells . these cells were named vero/dogslam, vero/monkeyslam and vero/humanslam, respectively. for virus isolation study, these cells were passaged fewer than five times.fig.  <dig> stable expression of dog, monkey and human slam protein on vero cells. vero cells were transfected with expression plasmids to mediate expression of ha epitope-tagged slam proteins from dog, monkey, and human and selected with g <dig>  the control vero cells were transfected by empty vector. the resulting cell lines were named vero/dogslam,vero/monkeyslam and vero/humanslam. anti-influenza virus ha epitope mab was used to confirm surface expression of each version of the slam protein by flow cytometry



isolation of cdv from the lung tissue of a deceased rhesus monkey
we used the vero/dogslam cells to isolate cdv from lung samples collected previously from a deceased rhesus monkey that had displayed signs of cd. inoculation of the vero/dogslam cells with supernatants from the homogenized tissue resulted in an obvious cytopathic effect , whereas no cpe was observed after four blind passages of the supernatants on the vero cells . nucleoprotein expression in the cells was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence assay . the nucleoprotein antigen was detected in vero/dogslam cells inoculated with homogenized tissue supernatants but was not detected the inoculated vero cells . the viruses isolated from the inoculated vero/dogslam cells were named monkey-bj01-dv.fig.  <dig> infection of vero cells expressing dog slam protein with cdv from a deceased rhesus monkey. microscopic evaluation of vero/dogslam cells  and vero cells  following inoculation with monkey-bj01-dv at a moi of  <dig> . inoculation of vero/dogslam cells resulted in obvious cpe. detection of cdv antigens in vero cells expressing the dog slam protein  and untransfected vero cells  64 h following inoculation with monkey-bj01-cdv at a moi of  <dig> . cells were fixed and probed with a mouse monoclonal anti-cdv nucleoprotein antibody. a fitc-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody was used for detection



phylogenetic analysis of the h protein of monkey-bj01-dv
we sequenced the full-length h protein of the monkey-bj01-dv  and performed a phylogenetic analysis of this strain and others deposited in genbank . the monkey-bj01-dv was highly similar to the other cyn07-dv monkey strains  and monkey-km- <dig> , which were isolated from a cynomolgus monkey and from a rhesus monkey, respectively  <cit> . these three monkey strains are each associated with cdv outbreaks among monkeys in china and belong to the asia type i lineage. the cdv h protein is responsible for host cell attachment, is the most variable protein described for all members of the genus morbillivirus and is an important determinant of the cdv host range  <cit> . we found that the h protein from these three strains of monkey-cdv possessed a number of amino acid specific substitutions compared to the h protein of cdv epidemic in other animals at the same period, as shown in table 1: e276v, q392r, d435y and i542f. the glycine  residue at position  <dig> and the tyrosine  residue at position  <dig>  which correspond to the partial slam-receptor binding region, were conserved among all three monkey cdv isolates and among cdv isolates from members of canidae and mustelidae .table  <dig> amino acid differences between the hemagglutinin of monkey-bj01-dv and other cdv isolates

replication of monkey-bj01-dv on vero cells expressing slam from dog-, monkey-, or human- origin
we next evaluated the replication ability of the monkey-bj01-dv in engineered vero/slam cell lines. monkey-bj01-dv replicated to the highest titers on vero/dogslam  and vero/monkeyslam  at 48 h post-infection, whereas replication on the vero/humanslam cells was reduced approximately 100-fold . the dog-cdv isolate from a tibetan mastiff replicated to high titers on the vero/dogslam cells and displayed reduced titers on the vero cells expressing slam from monkey- or human- origin. our results indicate that both the monkey- and dog-cdv isolates can efficiently replicate on vero cells expressing either the monkey- or dog-origin slam receptor, but replicate less efficiently on cells expressing the slam receptor of human- origin.fig.  <dig> replication of monkey-bj01-dv and cdv-tm-cc in vero/slam cells. cells were infected at a moi of  <dig> . viral titers were measured 48 h post-infection



discussion
morbilliviruses, including measles virus , cdv, and rinderpest virus , are thought to have originated from a common ancestor several thousand years ago  <cit> . in general, however, each virus is able to naturally infect a relatively restricted number of host species. mv infection is limited to primates, cdv infection is limited to members of the canidae, mustelidae and procyonidae families, and rpv infection is limited to ruminants  <cit> . experimentally, monkeys are susceptible to mv infection and dogs to cdv infection  <cit> . despite the apparent host range restriction of morbilliviruses, cdv has crossed species barriers, suggesting a potential ongoing expansion of host range. the first report of natural cdv infection of non-human primates was reported in  <dig> among japanese monkeys  <cit> . in  <dig>  a cdv epidemic affected a rhesus monkey  breeding farm in china, inflicting high morbidity  and mortality  in young monkeys  <cit> . in  <dig>  japan imported  <dig> cynomolgus monkeys  from china and  <dig> died from cdv while held in quarantine  <cit> . we isolated cdv from a deceased rhesus monkey  following a  <dig> outbreak in beijing in which  <dig> of  <dig> rhesus monkeys died from cdv  <cit> . collectively, these reports suggest significant changes in the epidemiology of cdv caused by an expanding cdv host range and/or viral virulence.

the complete genomes of three monkey-origin cdv isolates associated with outbreaks in china have been reported , cyn07-dv  and mky-km- <dig>  and are highly related to other epidemic cdv strains affecting species of the canidae and mustelidae families in china  <cit>  . the h protein mediates viral attachment by binding to one or more cellular receptors  <cit> . several studies have speculated about the impact of specific amino acid substitutions within the h protein on interactions with the slam receptor. in vitro receptor-binding studies showed that amino acid residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of the h protein are conserved among all morbilliviruses and are crucial for cdv-h to slam dependent fusion  <cit> . in particular, residues  <dig> and  <dig> both fall into receptor-binding domains located on propeller β-sheet  <dig> of the h protein  <cit> . sequence analysis of the h gene of all three monkey cdv strains revealed a glycine  and a tyrosine  at amino acid positions  <dig> and  <dig> of the partial slam-receptor binding region. g <dig> and y <dig> are typically found in viral strains obtained from dogs in china, whereas other amino acid residues are present in cdv isolates obtained from wildlife  <cit> . this suggests that the cdv isolated from monkeys was transmitted from domestic dogs rather than from other wildlife. in this study, we found that amino acid y <dig> was conserved within cdv lineages of the isolates analyzed, regardless of host species. cdv transmission in wild carnivore and non-canid species may most often occur between individuals within a species, and may also be influenced by a range of additional factors such as population size and ranging patterns. the three monkey cdv strains possessed e276v, q392r, d435y and i542f substitutions, which are unique changes when compared to the other asia type i lineage strains. in particularly, the i542f substitution falls with the slam-binding regions of the h protein. the h protein amino acid substitutions identified among monkey cdv isolates may help explain recent changes in cdv host range.

the monkey-bj01-dv can efficiently grow on the vero cells expressing slam from dog- and monkey-origin, but not the cells expressing slam receptor of human- origin. interestingly, while the amino acid sequence identity of dog and monkey slam is only  <dig>  %, the monkey-bj01-dv strain can replicate on the vero cells expressing slam receptor of dog-origin as efficiently as the vero cells expressing monkey-origin slam. factors other than the receptor binding, such as intracellular replication of the viruses may also be important for the establishment of infection. further studies are required to understand the mechanisms by which cdv can cross species barriers.

CONCLUSIONS
canine distemper virus isolated from a deceased rhesus monkey efficiently replicates on the vero cells expressing non-human primate slam receptors but not human slam receptor. the monkey origin-cdv-h protein could possess specific substitutions to adapt to the new host.
