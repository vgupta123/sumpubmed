BACKGROUND
in  <dig>  the pioneering work of sprott showed that parenteral administration of nano-sized vesicles  prepared with total polar lipids  extracted from microorganisms of the archaea domain of life  <cit> , produced a strong humoral response in mice  <cit> . archaeal lipids exhibit radically different hydrocarbon backbones and polar head groups, as compared to polar lipids synthesized by organisms from eukarya and bacteria domains. archaeal lipid backbones possess ether linkages and isoprenoid chains, mainly phytanyl and bysphythanediyl - archaeols and caldarchaeols- in sn- <dig>  enantiomeric configuration, in contrast to the ester linkages, straight fatty acyl chains and sn- <dig>  configuration of the glycerophospholipids from eukarya and bacteria domains  <cit> . ether links are more resistant to acid hydrolysis than esters and the backbone/head group cross section of archaeal lipids is almost two folds higher than that of glycerophospholipids from eukarya and bacteria domains  <cit> . the same as liposomes, arc can be prepared by self association of archaeal lipids upon a small input of energy in aqueous media . however, beyond those apparent similarities, there are remarkable structural differences: the arc surface is highly entropic, possessing half the surface tension than that of liposomes  <cit>  and its permeability to protons and sodium cation is nearly one third of that determined for liposomes; the inclusion of macrocyclic archaeols and caldarchaeols further impairs arc permeability to water and small solutes  <cit> .

those structural features make the arc capable of establishing unique interactions with the biological environment, specifically eliciting adjuvancy to foreign proteins upon subcutaneous administration in preclinical models by strongly stimulating both the humoral as well as the cellular response, together with a sharp memory recall. additionally, lipopolysaccharides are absent in archaea  <cit>  and, opposite to conventional immunomodulators that usually must be included into the liposomal structure  <cit> , no toxicity has been found after parenteral administration of arc, even at high or multiple dosage  <cit> .

for strategic development of third world countries, it is of crucial importance to count on vaccines of unproblematic storage-conservation, with high resistance to hydrolysis, oxidation and mechanical destruction, or easily reconstitutable upon lyophilization  <cit> . adjuvants should preferably be biodegradable, non toxic, abundant, cheap and available from sustainable sources. because arc are suitable candidates to fulfill those requirements, it is relevant to survey the adjuvant properties of arc made of tpl extracted from unexplored archaeal genera and species. in such context, we determined the cytotoxicity, intracellular transit and adjuvant activity of arc prepared with total polar lipids of two h. tebenquichense strains isolated from argentine patagonia, upon two subcutaneous bsa doses followed by a single boosting inoculation in c3h/hen mice.

RESULTS
strain isolation, growth and characterization
halophilic archaea isolated from the upper gray crystals  and the deeper black mud  strata grown in enriched medium were characterized as disc-shaped , motile gram-negative microorganisms. differentially, gc and bm colonies exhibited orange-red and reddish pigmentation, respectively. however, when grown in basal medium, a mixture of pleomorphic rods and disc-shaped motile archaebacteria displaying undefined gram staining was observed.

the colonies grew in 10-20% nacl-containing media, without mg+ <dig> requirements, but optimum growth occurred at 20% nacl, 40°c and ph  <dig>  -  <dig> . remarkably, gc was able to grow at increased temperature . both colonies were non-alkaliphilic, aerobic, oxidase and catalase positive. only gc produced acid from a fructose source. fructose, pyruvate, trehalose and galactose, but not starch, were used as sole carbon and energy sources by both colonies . both gc and bm organisms were chloramphenicol resistant and experienced no lysis even in the total absence of sodium salt.

symbols: + positive result; - negative result; +/- slight mark; nr not reported.

for each isolate, a nearly complete 16s rdna gene region  was sequenced  and compared with the same segment from other halophilic archaea. phylogenetic analyses showed that both isolates belong to the archaea domain and are related to the halorubrum cluster, with the highest similarity to halorubrum tebenquichense . the g+c contents of the two isolates and the reference strain alt-92t  <cit>  were determined. bm and gc had a g+c content of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mol%, respectively , whereas alt-92t presented  <dig>  mol%. on the basis of the ad hoc committee recommendations  <cit>  of a threshold value of 70% dna-dna similarity for the definition of bacterial species, the two strains formed an homogeneous cluster with a high degree of internal similarity  and should be considered as members of the same h. tebenquichense species.

the random amplified polymorphic dna  or arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction  dna fingerprinting technique provides one of the most sensitive and efficient of current methods for distinguishing different strains of a species  <cit> . in order to corroborate such differences between the two isolates, ap-pcr fingerprint analysis was performed . the band pattern showed visible differences between bm and gc fingerprint , in concordance with biochemical tests and 16s rdna sequence data. in sum, differences in fructose metabolism, utilization of starch and optimum growth conditions , together with those revealed by the ap-pcr, suggested that bm and gc isolates were different not only from those described for h. tebenquichense alt- <dig> t  <cit> , but also between each other and could be classified as new h. tebenquichense strains.

lipid extraction and characterization
the tpl, defined as the acetone insoluble portion of the total lipids, extracted from frozen cells obtained from a batch of  <dig> litres, ranged between  <dig> and  <dig> mg for each isolate.

a high content of phosphate groups is reported in the literature for the halorubrum genus. hence, for tpl quantification two colorimetric methods were applied: one, for detecting total phosphate  and the other for detecting organic phosphate . two calibration curves were prepared employing dry mass of tpl as standards that resulted linear between 10- <dig> μg for bötcher and 20- <dig> μg for stewart, with correlation coefficients exceeding  <dig> , for each source of tpl.

on the other hand, calibration curves using inorganic phosphate  as standard were prepared with the aim of determining the phosphate percentage of archaeal lipids by the bötcher method. a linear plot of dry mass of tpl vs. μg inorganic phosphate was determined and the relative amount of phosphate in the extracted tpl was similar for both isolates, in the order of  <dig> % w/w.

esi -ms polar lipids profile
the esi-ms spectrum  analyses of the tpl of h. tebenquichense, bm and gc showed three main peaks at m/z  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  . in addition, gc displayed intense ion peak at m/z  <dig> that was less intense for h. tebenquichense and bm extracts. the peaks at m/z  <dig>   and  <dig>  that were reported for halorubrum sp.  <cit>  could not be detected in any of our samples. negative ion esi-ms  identified major signals corresponding to pg m/z  <dig> , pgp-me m/z  <dig>  ,  <dig>  and s-dgd m/z  <dig>  . the diagnostic peak of archaeal cardiolipin  at m/z  <dig>  and  <dig>  was detected only as a small signal in the three tpl extracts.

arc characterization
as revealed by transmission electron microscopy, the two arc preparations were multilamellar, with a mean size of  <dig> ±  <dig> nm and zeta-potential near to - <dig> mv. bsa incorporation did not modify size or zeta potential, the protein/lipid ratio was  <dig> μg/mg and the encapsulation efficiency around 3-4%.

arc uptake by cells and cellular toxicity
none of the arc or hspc:cholesterol liposomes significantly reduced the viability of non phagocytic cells  upon  <dig> h incubation . on the other hand,  <dig> μg/ml arc-gc was non cytotoxic but the higher concentrations reduced cell viability by 25%, while increased concentrations  of arc-bm and hspc:cholesterol liposomes did not affect cultured macrophages  .

as shown in figure 4a, and independently of the tpl source, a minimal time period of  <dig> min was required for arc uptake by phagocytic cells, as judged by the detection of intracellular fluorescence after incubation with both arc-hpts/dpx. in addition, j- <dig> macrophages incubated  <dig> min with both arc- hpts/dpx showed punctual fluorescence  that resulted from the confinement of the hpts/dpx into vesicular compartments in the cytoplasm. in case membrane fusion between arc and the phagosome occurred, the arc inner content should be released to the cytoplasm. consequently, the hpts would be dequenched from dpx and an homogeneous brightness filling the cytoplasm should be observed  <cit> . however, the punctual emission upon excitation at  <dig> nm, indicating confinement of the pair hpts/dpx in acidic compartments, remained unchanged. hence, the arc did not fuse/disrupt, staying inside the phagosomes for at least  <dig> minutes .

antibody response
to evaluate the adjuvant activity of both arc formulations, we tested the antigen-specific humoral immune response after immunization of mice with bsa-loaded arc. following sc inoculations at  <dig> and  <dig> days, mice responded by day  <dig> with similar anti-bsa antibody  titers for both arc-bm/gc-bsa , and presented a strong enhancement  of antibody titers over those of bsa and bsa-al groups. immunization with either empty arc-bm/gc failed to evoke any anti-bsa igg response, whereas only one out of four mice receiving adjuvant-free bsa displayed detectable specific antibodies. mean titers in arc-bm/gc-bsa groups were sustained until at least day  <dig> and declined by day  <dig>  in all cases, very little anti-bsa igm reactivity was detected throughout the study .

to investigate the ability of arc to generate long-term memory immunity, a boost-dose with bsa alone was injected on day  <dig>  three weeks later, a significantly higher serum antibody response  was detected in arc-bm/gc-bsa compared with the bsa group .

we further examined the igg isotype distribution in the sera of immunized mice on day  <dig>  both igg <dig> and igg2a increased antibody titers could be demonstrated in long-term responses from arc-bm/gc-bsa groups .

discussion
the extreme halophilic archaea genus halorubrum is worldwide distributed  <cit>  either at high altitude as well as under the sea level  <cit> . the only halorubrum species so far described in south america is the halorubrum tebenquichense alt6- <dig> strain isolated from the water of lake tebenquiche at the unique environment of the atacama saltern, located in northern chile at  <dig> metres above sea level  <cit> . here we report the finding of new h. tebenquichense non alkaliphilic strains in a salt flat from the littoral of the argentinean patagonia, the salina chica in península de valdés , at the province of chubut. remarkably, the salina chica is separated from lake tebenquiche by the highest  and younger  mountains in america, the cordillera de los andes, distant  <dig> km south-east away and placed  <dig> meters below sea level in a zone of temperate weather.

the membranes of extremely halophilic archaea such as h. tebenquichense have several unique characteristics that vary little within specific genera  <cit> . phospholipids with ethanolamine, inositol, and serine head groups are generally absent and specific phosphatidylglycerol phospholipids, sometimes including several sulfated glycolipids, predominate. extreme halophiles contain 50-80% archaetidylglycerol methylphosphate , an archaeal analogue of phosphatidylglycerol methylphosphate  <cit>  that contributes to membrane stability in hypersaline environments  <cit> , archaetidylglycerol , and also some strains have minor amounts of sulfated pg  <cit> .

analysis of esi-ms spectra of polar lipid isolates from h. tebenquichense, bm and gc, through comparison with the reference data  <cit>  suggested the main phospholipids present in the extracts were phosphatidylglycerol , phosphatidylglycerophosphate methyl ester  and sulfated diglycosyl diphytanylglycerol diether . the prominent peak at  <dig>  corresponded to s-dgd and is representative of the halorubrum genus  <cit> . the archaeal cardiolipin, bisphosphatidyl glycerol  was only found as traces in the three samples. while the complete lipid quantitation from each sample as well as the rmn identification of the s-dgd sulfonolipid will be accomplished in ongoing research.

up to now, only arc made of tpl extracted from methanobrevibacter smithii, a methanogen archaea, are known to enhance the recruitment and activation of antigen presenting cells  <cit> , induce co-stimulatory molecules expression  <cit> , elicit cd8+ cytotoxic responses even in the absence of cd4+ helper t-lymphocytes  <cit> , and to evoke a profound memory response, those all important stimuli that other vesicular systems such as liposomes, niosomes and iscoms are unable to trigger  <cit> . additionally, although inflammation in innate responses can enable further adaptive responses  <cit> , arc made of tpl from m. smithii evoke immunologic memory in the lack of visible inflammation, activating dendritic cells in the absence of il-12-dependent initial inflammatory response  <cit> .

as regard to the extreme halophiles, arc made of tpl extracted from halobacterium salinarum was reported to induce a robust initial ctl and antibody response in mice  <cit> . such titers, however, were not increased after boost administration and failed to induce a significant memory response. only arc made of tpl extracted from the hyperthermophile thermoplasma acidophilum produced the most intense antibody memory responses to antigen challenge, together with a parallel induction of intense cell cycling in cd4+ t cells suggesting efficient maintenance of t-cell memory  <cit> . a further study showed that among arc from nine archaeal strains tested, all triggered remarkable primary ctl responses but only m. smithii and t. acidophilum, both rich in caldarchaeols, evoked a strong recall at >  <dig> weeks  <cit> .

this is the first report of adjuvancy after parenteral administration of arc-bm/gc-bsa. both arc elicited a strong and lasting primary antibody response, and remarkably in the absence of caldarchaeols in their lipid compositions, an enhanced memory humoral response after boosting with the bare antigen in c3h/hen mice upon subcutaneous immunization. arc-bm/gc-bsa initially triggered higher antibody titers than bsa formulated in alum adjuvant. additionally, igg isotype analysis of immunized mice revealed that both bsa-specific igg <dig> and igg2a antibodies were raised by both arc-bm/gc-bsa, suggesting induction of a mixed th1/th <dig> response, in agreement with a previous report  <cit> . our preliminary finding of humoral immune memory response elicited by arc from extreme halophiles, together with established data on primary ctl and memory responses from arc made of tpl from methanogens and hyperthermophiles, suggests that the headgroups are of crucial importance in the induction of immune responses, as recently determined by employing synthetic glycoarchaeols  <cit> .

to sum up, even though our results for igg isotyping in a single strain of mice  may not be extrapolated to the response in humans, it is promising to note that, in preclinical evaluation in animal model, arc-bm/gc-bsa would appear as an efficient adjuvant delivery system to promote both humoral and, probably, cell-mediated immunity to the entrapped antigen.

CONCLUSIONS
two sc immunizations with either arc-bm/gc-bsa, plus a boost with bsa alone rendered a long term humoral response stronger than that achieved with bsa formulated in alum.

remarkably, our results were elicited in c3h/hen mice, less prone to render potent humoral responses than balb/c and c57bl/ <dig> backgrounds  <cit> . such preliminary results merit deeper insights on the search of cd8+ ctl activity and the induction of this type of long term memory upon sc immunization with arc. as judged by the phagosomal traffic followed by the pair hpts/dpx loaded in arc, our results indicated that there was neither fusion nor arc content delivery to the cytoplasm, for at least  <dig> minutes post arc uptake. hence, cytoplasmic delivery of hydrosoluble material loaded in arc-bm/gc should not happen, could either take longer than  <dig> minutes  or could occur through mechanisms other than the fusion mechanism recently reported for methanobrevibacter smithii archaeosomes  <cit> . finally, in spite of their tpl invariance, extreme halophilic archaea are source of glycolipid fractions that probably markedly influence the induction of primary responses and memory recall  <cit> . in view of that, the complete composition of arc tpl and the mechanisms of recruitment, uptake and intracytoplasmic traffic of this antigen-delivery system are currently being analyzed in parallel with the arc ability to induce expression of co-stimulatory molecules on professional apc.
