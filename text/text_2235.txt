BACKGROUND
on the basis of lymphokines profile, cd4+ t cells can be differentiated into th <dig> and th <dig> subtypes. th <dig> cells secrete il- <dig>  ifn-γ, lymphotoxin, etc., and are mainly involved in the generation of cell-mediated immunity. th <dig> cells secrete il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  etc., and are generally involved in humoral immunity  <cit> . these differentiated cells are the effector arms of the immune system that respond more rapidly and effectively to pathogens that have been encountered previously and reflect the pre-existence of clonally expanded populations of antigen-specific lymphocytes. hence it is quite crucial to study the factors that govern the reactivation of the differentiated th <dig> and th <dig> cells. many factors such as antigen presenting cells , pro-th <dig> and proth- <dig> cytokines, strength of first signal and expression of costimulatory molecules may influence the activation of th <dig> and th <dig> cells  <cit> . antigen presenting cells like b cells, macrophages and dendritic cells are critical players in the immune response. dendritic cells are potent activators of naïve t cells but it has been reported that b cells are the most potent apcs in inducing proliferation of differentiated th <dig> cells and splenic macrophages for differentiated th <dig> cells  <cit> . further, it has also been suggested that peritoneal macrophages are favored apcs for both th <dig> and th <dig> cells. however, it has also been shown that b cells can function, as apcs for th <dig> cells but for th <dig> cells, the presence of il- <dig> is required  <cit> . the strength of signaling through mhc-peptide  can also affect the activity of terminally differentiated th <dig> and th <dig> cells. it has been reported that differential signaling via anti-cd <dig> mab inhibits il-2-dependent proliferation of th <dig> but not th <dig> cells  <cit> . the expression of costimulatory molecules on apcs is also crucial for the optimum activation of t cells and therefore may have relevance with diseases  <cit> . array of costimulatory molecules are expressed on the surface of apcs but the best-defined costimulators are b7- <dig> and b7- <dig>  <cit> . it has been reported that b7- <dig> and b7- <dig> and presence of pro-th <dig>  and pro-th <dig>  cytokines can differentially regulate the activation of th <dig> and th <dig> cells  <cit> .

it appears that apcs, costimulatory molecules and pro-th <dig> and pro-th <dig> cytokines operate in a complex and concerted manner that can manipulate the activation of effector th <dig> and th <dig> cells. to address this issue, we studied the role of pro-th <dig> and pro-th <dig> cytokines in the activation of th <dig> and th <dig> cells when b cells, splenic and peritoneal macrophages were used as apcs. further, the role of different doses of first  and second signals  was also studied. it was observed that regulation of the activation of th <dig> and th <dig> cells is not a mere function of cytokines but can be significantly modulated by the type of apcs and dose of first and second signals.

RESULTS
influence of pro-th <dig>  and pro-th <dig>  cytokines on the proliferation and ifn-γ secretion by th <dig> cells when b cells, splenic and peritoneal macrophages were used as a source of apcs. in the present study we have chosen very well characterized and widely studied th <dig>  and th <dig> clones . antigen-pulsed and gamma-irradiated b cells and macrophages were used as apcs. we observed the maximum proliferation of th <dig> cells with peritoneal macrophages  followed by splenic macrophages  . minimum proliferation  was observed when b cells were used as a source of apcs. interestingly, when either il- <dig> or il- <dig> was added into the cultures, there was a significant  enhancement in the proliferation of th <dig> cells when b cells were used as a source of apcs. it may also be noted here that in all the experiments, most potent dose of cytokines was used that was selected after conducting dose dependent experiments . there was a marginal increase with il- <dig>  but ifn-γ failed to bring any noticeable change in the proliferation of th <dig> cells when b cells were used as a source of apcs. surprisingly, addition of cytokines  could not induce any change in the proliferation with splenic macrophages. in contrast, ifn-γ  inhibited the proliferation when peritoneal macrophages were used .

we observed maximum secretion of ifn-γ by th <dig> cells when peritoneal macrophages  were used as a source of apcs followed by splenic macrophages  and b cells . interestingly, the presence of il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  significantly enhanced the secretion of ifn-γ when b cells, but not splenic and peritoneal macrophages were employed to present antigen . the presence of il- <dig> could not modulate any change in ifn-γ release in the presence of either b cells or macrophages.

influence of pro-th <dig>  and pro-th <dig>  cytokines on the proliferation and il- <dig> and il- <dig> production by th <dig> cells when b cells, splenic and peritoneal macrophages were used as a source of apcs. peritoneal macrophages  were the most potent apcs followed by b cells  in inducing the proliferation of th <dig> cells. splenic macrophages  induced lowest proliferation. interestingly, il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> significantly  enhanced the proliferation of th <dig> cells when b cells and splenic macrophages were used as a source of apcs . no change was observed with il- <dig>  however, the proliferation was significantly inhibited by ifn-γ in the presence of splenic  and peritoneal  macrophages.

th <dig> cells maximally secreted il- <dig> when peritoneal macrophages  were used as a source of apcs followed by b cells  . splenic macrophages  were poor stimulator of th <dig> cells for il- <dig> secretion. interestingly, addition of ifn-γ significantly augmented the yield of il- <dig> irrespective of the type of apcs used in the study. addition of il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> significantly enhanced the secretion of il- <dig> when splenic and peritoneal macrophages but not b cells were used as apcs.

there was dramatic increase in the release of il- <dig> by th <dig> cells with peritoneal macrophages . b cells  and splenic macrophages  could also induce moderate production of il- <dig>  addition of il- <dig> significantly increased the production of il- <dig> with all the three apcs . further, incorporation of il- <dig> into b cell cultures also enhanced the secretion of il- <dig>  addition of il- <dig> and ifn-γ in the cultures failed to show any dramatic change in the secretion of il- <dig> 

influence of first and second signals in the proliferation and ifn-γ secretion by th <dig> cells. after studying the role of apcs, we also monitored the role of different doses of first  and second  signals in the activation of th <dig> and th <dig> cells . the first signal was provided using low , moderate  and high concentration  of anti-cd <dig> ab and second signal in the form of low , moderate  and high number  of b7- <dig> transfectants. moderate to high but not low concentration of anti-cd <dig> ab induced optimum proliferation of th <dig> cells . interestingly, addition of high concentration of b7- <dig> transfectants  into the cultures also successfully enhanced the proliferation of the cells stimulated with low strength of first signal  . even though, moderate dose of anti-cd <dig> ab induced the optimum level of proliferation but the addition of high dose of b7- <dig> transfectants further enhanced the proliferation of th <dig> cells . in contrary, delivery of strong first signal in association with high number of b7- <dig> transfectants showed inhibitory effect. low dose of first signal alone failed to induce the secretion of ifn-γ . however, with the increase in the concentration of anti-cd <dig> ab , detectable level of ifn-γ was noticed. when t cells were stimulated with low dose of first signal, b7- <dig> costimulation showed marginal increase in the ifn-γ yield. interestingly, addition of low to high dose of b7- <dig> transfectants in the th <dig> cell cultures stimulated with either moderate or strong first signals could substantially enhance the secretion of ifn-γ . similar results were also obtained in the case of ae <dig> th <dig> cells .

importance of the first and second signals in proliferation and cytokine  secretion by th <dig> cells. it was observed that moderate dose of anti-cd <dig> ab induced the proliferation of th <dig> cells  . like th <dig> cells, addition of high dose of b7- <dig> transfectants augmented the proliferation of th <dig> cells stimulated with low dose of anti-cd <dig> ab . interestingly, b7- <dig> signal showed marginal increase in the proliferation with the moderate dose but inhibition was observed with high dose of first signal . also delivery of b7-1-mediated signal could not show any change in the secretion of il- <dig> when cells were stimulated with low dose of first signal . however, high dose of first signal alone induced significant level of il- <dig> secretion. unlike proliferation, addition of moderate to high, but not low numbers of b7- <dig> transfectants further enhanced the secretion of il- <dig> by th <dig> cells that were stimulated with high dose of anti-cd <dig> ab. as observed in the case of il- <dig> secretion, similar results were demonstrated in the case of il- <dig> production .

influence of pro-th <dig>  and pro-th <dig>  cytokines in proliferation and ifn-γ secretion by th <dig> cells stimulated with anti-cd <dig> ab and b7- <dig>  it was observed that il- <dig> significantly  enhanced the proliferation of th <dig> cells that were activated with anti-cd <dig> ab and b7- <dig> . we also observed that il- <dig> enhanced the secretion of ifn-γ by th <dig> cells stimulated with anti-cd <dig> ab and b7- <dig> . in control cultures, anti-cd <dig> ab alone induced the secretion of ifn-γ and addition of b7- <dig> transfectants substantially enhanced its production.

influence of pro-th <dig>  and pro-th <dig>  cytokines in proliferation and il- <dig> and il- <dig> secretion by th <dig> cells stimulated with anti-cd <dig> ab and b7- <dig>  it was observed that both il- <dig> and il- <dig> significantly  enhanced the proliferation of th <dig> cells activated with anti-cd <dig> ab and b7- <dig> . interestingly, ifn-γ not only inhibited  the proliferation of th <dig> cells activated with anti-cd <dig> ab and b7- <dig> but also decreased il- <dig> and il- <dig> mediated proliferation significantly . in the control wells, anti-cd <dig> ab alone showed marginal proliferation but when b7- <dig> transfectants were added, significant proliferation  was noticed. il- <dig> further augmented the secretion of il- <dig> when th <dig> cells were stimulated with anti-cd <dig> ab and b7- <dig> transfectants . surprisingly, like il- <dig>  ifn-γ also upregulated the secretion of il- <dig>  when il- <dig> and ifn-γ were used in combination, they showed additive effect. il- <dig> induced remarkable amount of il- <dig> production by th <dig> cells that were activated with anti-cd <dig> ab and b7- <dig> . we also observed that il- <dig> secretion augmented by il- <dig> was significantly decreased on addition of il- <dig> and ifn-γ into the cultures. in the control cultures, we detected significant secretion of il- <dig> by th <dig> cells activated with anti-cd <dig> ab but there was no major change with the addition of b7- <dig> transfectants.

discussion
both th <dig> and th <dig> cells play a major role in generating effective immune response. but th <dig> and th <dig> cells can also be devastating in some disease conditions like allergy and autoimmunity respectively  <cit> . many factors like the strength of first signal, expression of costimulatory molecules, presence of cytokines, interaction with different apcs, etc., can influence the activation of th <dig> and th <dig> cells  <cit> . but how the concerted action of these factors influence their activation is not very well documented. it is therefore of enormous interest to know how these factors govern the proliferation, cytokine production and development of effector function of th <dig> and th <dig> cells. we therefore conducted this study to investigate the role of pro-th <dig> and pro-th <dig> cytokines in the activation of rested th <dig> and th <dig> cells. this activation is caused by different concentration of anti-cd <dig> ab and b7- <dig> transfectants as a source of first signal and second signals respectively and b cells, splenic and peritoneal macrophages as apcs.

we observed that as compared to b cells and splenic macrophages, maximum proliferation and cytokine secretion by th <dig> and th <dig> cells was observed when peritoneal macrophages were used as apcs. this may be due to the fact that thioglycollate elicited peritoneal macrophages release cytokines and express high level of costimulatory molecules  <cit> . interestingly, ifn-γ, in the presence of peritoneal macrophages but not splenic macrophages and b cells suppressed the proliferation of th <dig> cells mainly. the reason for this observation may be explained by the fact that on interaction with th <dig> cells, macrophages produce nitric oxide . thioglycollate elicited macrophages are high producers of il- <dig>  il- <dig> skews immune response towards th <dig> cells, which in turn produce ifn-γ. recently, it has been reported in the case of t. crassiceps that peritoneal macrophages impair t cell proliferation by secreting no. nitric oxide also contributes to asthma pathogenesis by selective down-regulation of th <dig> responses  <cit> . it may be inferred from this finding that activated macrophages interact with th <dig> cells in a manner that leads to high production of ifn-γ that can inhibit their proliferation and impair their capacity to respond to cytokines. this strategy may be utilized by intracellular pathogens in taming macrophages in their favor and thereby suppressing th <dig> response  <cit> . therefore targeting antigen to other apcs like b cell and dendritic cell for the activation of th <dig> cells during intracellular infection of macrophages may avoid immunosuppression. our observation shows that b cells can significantly respond to cytokines to further enhance the proliferation and cytokine release by th <dig> and th <dig> cells . addition of exogenous cytokines  had no effect on the proliferation of th <dig> and th <dig> cells in the presence of macrophages . in contrast, ifn-γ and il- <dig> significantly enhanced the production of il- <dig> and il- <dig> respectively by th <dig> cells in presence of b cells, splenic and peritoneal macrophages. this indicates that signals delivered by ifn-γ or il- <dig> worked irrespective of the type of apcs. il- <dig> is an important mediator of eosinophilia in mice with parasite infections. it has also been shown that mice administered il- <dig> developed eosinophilia. therefore our study indicates that precaution should be taken while using il- <dig> for immunomodulation, since despite inhibiting, it induces eosinophilia  <cit> . further, the finding that ifn-γ induces il- <dig> secretion by th <dig> cells is in contrast with the earlier findings but recently, it has been reported that ifn-γ has dual role in the activation of th <dig> cells  <cit> . high concentration of ifn-γ can inhibit whereas low dose can prime cells to develop into il- <dig> secreting th <dig> cells. this indicates that depending on the concentration, a cytokine can have dual role on th <dig> and th <dig> cells and subsequently on the outcome of the disease. further, these observations indicate that cytokine-mediated regulation of polarization of cd4+ t cells to the th <dig> or th <dig> phenotype is more complex than originally envisioned in the studies that examined the dominant role of cytokines  <cit> .

our observation also indicates that ifn-γ can act directly on differentiated th <dig> cells to enhance il- <dig> production and not necessarily through apcs. ifn-γ enhanced the secretion of il- <dig> when th <dig> cells were stimulated with anti-cd <dig> ab and b7- <dig> transfectant. however, this does not rule out the possibility of ifn-γ working on th <dig> cells through apcs as well. this is evident by the fact that the production of il- <dig> was higher when stimulated with apcs as compared to anti-cd <dig> ab and b7- <dig> transfectants .

another important observation of the study was that appropriate dose of first signal and expression of costimulatory molecules is quite crucial for the optimum proliferation and cytokine secretion by th <dig> and th <dig> cells. interestingly, addition of b7- <dig> transfectants in the cultures using low dose of anti-cd <dig> ab , significantly enhanced the proliferation and cytokine secretion. the significance of this observation is that it may have important application in vaccine design and development. formulating a device using costimulatory molecules may elicit optimal t-cell response with even low dose of antigen. therefore, one can overcome the problems related to high dose inoculation of antigen. we also observed that a high dose of first signal delivered in the form of anti-cd <dig> ab inhibits the proliferation of th <dig> and th <dig> cells. this indicates that high dose of antigen and constant stimulation can suppress the t cells. this may explain why the immune response generated due to dna vaccination fails to evoke a better response than protein antigens. further, constant stimulation with high dose of antigen can limit protective function of t cells  <cit> .

thus it is quite obvious from our study that not only the presence of particular cytokines, but also the type of apcs and the dose of first and second signals may have significant impact on the activation of th <dig> and th <dig> cells. so it is quite necessary to take into account the concerted action of the type of apcs, effectiveness of first and second signals and the presence of cytokines while studying the activation of rested th <dig> and th <dig> cells. this study may be of paramount importance when studying the in vivo immune response generated by the vaccines. different individuals respond in a different way to vaccines. one possible reason may be the difference in type of apcs that encounter the antigen, the density of antigen, the expression of costimulatory molecules and cytokine milieu. thus our experiments emphasize the need for detailed analysis of the host immune system before immunizing with a vaccine or immunotherapeutic agents to generate effective immune response. further, our study suggests that immunization with antigen along with costimulatory molecules may significantly reduce the dose of antigen and can generate better immune response than observed with high dose of antigen.

CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrates the involvement of different type of apcs, cytokine milieu, dose of first and second signals in a concerted manner in the outcome of the immune response. the significance of this study is that the immunization with antigen along with costimulatory molecules may considerably decrease the quantity of antigen and can produce better immune response than antigen alone.
