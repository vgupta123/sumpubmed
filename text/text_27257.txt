BACKGROUND
development in microarray techniques makes it possible to profile gene expression on a whole genome scale and study associations between gene expression and occurrence or progression of common diseases such as cancer or heart disease. a large amount of efforts have been devoted to identifying genes that have influential effects on diseases. such studies can lead to better understanding of the genetic causation of diseases and better predictive models. analysis of microarray data is challenging because of the large number of genes surveyed and small sample sizes, and presence of cluster structure. here the clusters are composed of co-regulated genes with coordinated functions. without causing confusion, we use the phrases "clusters" and "gene groups" interchangeably in this article.

available statistical approaches for gene selection and predictive model building can be roughly classified into two categories. the first type focuses on selection of individual genes. examples of such studies range from early studies of detecting marginally differentially expressed genes under different experimental settings  <cit>  to selecting important genes for prediction of binary disease occurrence  <cit>  and detecting genes associated with patients' survival risks  <cit> . since the dimension of gene expressions measured  is much larger than the sample size , variable selection or model reduction are usually needed. previously employed approaches include the singular value decomposition  <cit> , principal component analysis  <cit> , partial least squares  <cit>  and lasso  <cit> , among others. these approaches aim at identifying a small subset of genes or linear combinations of genes-often referred as super genes, that can best explain the phenotype variations. a limitation of these approaches is that the cluster structure of gene expression data is not taken into account.

biologically speaking, complex diseases such as cancer, hiv and heart disease, are caused by mutations in gene pathways, instead of individual genes. statistically speaking, there exist genes with highly correlated expressions and should be put into clusters  <cit> . although functional groups and statistical clusters may not match perfectly, they tend to have certain correspondence  <cit> .

the second type of methods focuses on detecting differential gene clusters. examples include the global test  <cit> , the maxmean approach  <cit>  and the gene set enrichment analysis  <cit> . in classification and survival analysis, cluster-based approaches have also been considered  <cit> . one approach is to construct gene clusters first, which can be based on statistical measurements  or biological knowledge  <cit>  or both. then the mean expression levels are used as covariates in downstream analysis  <cit> . with the simple cluster based methods, it is assumed that if a cluster is strongly associated with the outcome, then all genes within that cluster are associated with the outcome, which is not necessarily true. within cluster gene selection may still be needed.

lasso  <cit>  is a popular method for variable selection with high-dimensional data, since it is capable of producing sparse models and is computationally feasible. for example, this method has been used for correlating survival with microarray data  <cit> . standard lasso approach carries out variable selection at the individual gene level. a recent development of the lasso is the group lasso method  <cit>  . the glasso is designed for selecting groups of covariates. in a recent study,  <cit>  proposes logistic classification with the glasso penalty and considers its applications in microarray study. direct application of the glasso can identify important gene groups. however, it is not capable of selecting important genes within the selected groups. the fitted model may not be sparse, especially if the clusters are large.

in this article, we propose a supervised group lasso  approach, which selects both important gene clusters and important genes within clusters. compared to individual gene based approaches such as lasso, the sglasso takes into consideration the cluster structure and can lead to better predictions, as shown in our empirical studies. compared to cluster based methods such as the glasso, the within-cluster gene selection aspect of sglasso leads to more parsimonious models and hence more interpretable gene selection results. the proposed approach is applicable as long as the objective function is well defined and locally differentiable. in this article, we apply the sglasso to logistic binary classification and cox survival analysis problems with microarray gene expression data.

RESULTS
binary classification
colon data
in this dataset, expression levels of  <dig> tumor and  <dig> normal colon tissues for  <dig> human genes are measured using the affymetrix gene chips. a selection of  <dig> genes with the highest minimal intensity across the samples has been made by  <cit> , and these data are publicly available at  <cit> . the colon data have been analyzed in several previous studies using other statistical approaches, see for example  <cit> .

nodal data
this dataset was first presented by  <cit> . it includes expression values of  <dig> genes of  <dig> breast tumor samples. the expression data were obtained using the affymetrix gene chip technology and are available at  <cit> . the response describes the lymph node  status, which is an indicator for the metastatic spread of the tumor, a very important risk factor for the disease outcome. among the  <dig> samples,  <dig> are positive  and  <dig> are negative . we threshold the raw data with a floor of  <dig> and a ceiling of  <dig>  genes with max/min <  <dig> and/or max – min <  <dig> are also excluded  <cit> .  <dig>  genes pass the first step screening. a base  <dig> logarithmic transformation is then applied. the nodal data have also been studied by  <cit> .

although there is no limitation on the number of genes that can be used in the proposed approach, we first identify  <dig> genes for each dataset based on marginal significance to gain further stability as in  <cit> . compute the sample standard errors of the d biomarkers se,..., se and denote their median as med.se. compute the adjusted standard errors as  <dig>  + med.se),...,  <dig>  + med.se). then the genes are ranked based on the t-statistics computed with the adjusted standard errors. the  <dig> genes with the largest absolute values of the adjusted t-statistics are used for classification. the adjusted t-statistic is similar to a simple shrinkage method discussed in  <cit> .

for the colon and nodal data, clusters are constructed using the k-means approach and the gap statistic is used to select the optimal number of clusters. we show in figure  <dig> the gap statistic as a function of the number of clusters.  <dig> clusters are constructed for the colon data and  <dig> clusters are constructed for the nodal data. details of the clustering information are available upon request. with the generated clusters, we apply the proposed sglasso approach. tuning parameters are chosen using 3-fold cross validation. summary model features are shown in table  <dig>  for the colon data,  <dig> genes are present in the final model, representing  <dig> clusters. for the nodal data,  <dig> genes are selected, representing  <dig> clusters. we list the identified genes in tables  <dig> and  <dig> 

nonzero: number of genes in the final models. cluster: number of clusters in the final models. prediction: for colon and nodal, leave-one-out prediction error; for follicular and mcl, the logrank statistic.

for the colon data, gene has. <dig> has also been identified to be associated with colon cancer in  <cit> . gene hsa. <dig> is estrogen sulfotransferase. research show that certain compounds, such as soy, have protective effect for colon cancer. the protective role of these compounds could be due to an ability to inhibit competitively the activation of promutagenic estrogen metabolites into carcinogens by estrogen sulfotransferases. the official symbol of gene hsa. <dig> is csnk1e. studies have revealed a negative regulatory function of ck <dig> in the wnt signaling pathway, where ck <dig> acts as a negative regulator of the lef-1/beta-catenin transcription complex, thereby protecting cells from development of cancer. gene hsa. <dig> has official symbol dcgr <dig>  it has been shown to be associated with mammary cancer and tumor cell proliferation in general. gene hsa. <dig>  has been shown to be related to cancer cell proliferation. gene hsa. <dig> is also identified as a colon cancer biomarker in  <cit> . gene hsa. <dig> has official symbol btn1a <dig>  rt-pcr analysis has revealed strongest expression of btnl <dig> in small intestine, colon, testis, and leukocytes. tristetraproline  has been reported to negatively regulate tumor necrosis factor alpha  production by binding the au-rich element within the 3' noncoding sequences of tnf-alpha mrna. gene hsa. <dig> is s100p protein. 100p is expressed in human cancers, including breast, colon, prostate, and lung. in colon cancer cell lines, its expression level was correlated with resistance to chemotherapy.

for the nodal data, gene u27185_at has official symbol rarres <dig>  also known as tig <dig>  the expression of this gene is upregulated by tazarotene as well as by retinoic acid receptors. silencing of tig <dig> promoter by hypermethylation is common in human cancers and may contribute to the loss of retinoic acid responsiveness in some neoplastic cells. the role of the matrilins  in tumorigenesis has not been studied. however, a related family of proteins  has been implicated in cancer. increased fibulin expression is seen in breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, colon cancer, and other solid tumors, suggesting that these proteins might play a role in tumor formation or progression. gene u <dig> is a member of the chimerin family and encodes a protein with a phorbol-ester/dag-type zinc finger, a rho-gap domain and an sh <dig> domain. decreased expression of this gene is associated with high-grade gliomas and breast tumors, and increased expression of this gene is associated with lymphomas. findings suggest that ceacam <dig>  participates in immune regulation in physiological conditions and in pathological conditions, such as inflammation, autoimmune disease, and cancer. gene d87071_at is a confirmed breast cancer biomarker. ras  and c-myc play important roles in the up-regulation of nucleophosmin/b <dig> during proliferation of cells associated with a high degree of malignancy, thus outlining a signaling cascade involving these factors in the cancer cells. gna <dig>  is involved in signaling of gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor, which negatively regulates cell growth.

down-regulation is suggested to be involved in human breast cancers. gene d <dig> encodes a member of the c-type lectin/c-type lectin-like domain  superfamily. members of this family share a common protein fold and have diverse functions, such as cell adhesion, cell-cell signaling, glycoprotein turnover, and roles in inflammation and immune response. gene x <dig> is human mrna for integrin beta  <dig>  colonization of the lungs by human breast cancer cells is correlated with cell surface expression of the alphabeta integrin and adhesion to human clca <dig> , tumor cell adhesion to endothelial hclca <dig> is mediated by the beta integrin, establishing for the first time a cell-cell adhesion property for this integrin that involves an entirely new adhesion partner. this adhesion is augmented by an increased surface expression of the alpha beta integrin in breast cancer cells selected in vivo for enhanced lung colonization but abolished by the specific cleavage of the beta integrin with matrilysin. wnt-5a  has been shown to influence the metastatic behavior of human breast cancer cells, and the loss of wnt-5a expression is associated with metastatic disease. nfat <dig>  a transcription factor connected with breast cancer metastasis, is activated by wnt-5a through a ca2+ signaling pathway in human breast epithelial cells. endogenous rxr beta  contributes to ere binding activity in nuclear extracts of the human breast cancer cell line mcf- <dig>  detailed microscopic analysis of the morphology of mcf <dig> breast cancer cells lacking ctbps  reveals an increase in the number of cells containing abnormal micronucleated cells and dividing cells with lagging chromosomes, indicative of aberrant mitotic chromosomal segregation. methyl-cpg-binding domain protein- <dig>  mediates transcriptional repression associated with hypermethylated gstp <dig> cpg islands in mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells. the nmt55/p54nrb protein  is post-transcriptionally regulated in human breast tumors leading to reduced expression in er- tumors and the expression of an amino terminal altered isoform in a subset of er+ tumors. expression of elastin  in breast carcinoma cells has been demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. cytochrome p <dig> 1b <dig>  is active in the metabolism of estrogens to reactive catechols and of different procarcinogens. the cyp1b <dig> gene polymorphisms do not influence breast cancer risk overall but may modify the risk after long-term menopausal hormone use. genetic deficiency of dpyd enzyme  results in an error in pyrimidine metabolism associated with thymine-uraciluria and an increased risk of toxicity in cancer patients receiving 5-flourouracil chemotherapy.

we evaluate the prediction performance of the proposed approach via leave-one-out  cross validation. for the colon and nodal data, we compute the loo cross validation errors. in this evaluation process, tuning parameters are computed using 3-fold cross validation for each reduced set. for comparison purposes, we also consider the following alternative approaches.

 <dig>  lasso: we ignore the clustering structures and apply the lasso directly. this approach has been considered in  <cit>  for cox survival analysis and  <cit>  for logistic binary classification.

 <dig>  glasso: we ignore the first step supervised selection and apply the glasso directly. for binary classification, the glasso has been investigated in  <cit> .

 <dig>  simple clustering: with the generated clusters, we compute the median of the gene expression level for each cluster. the medians are used as covariates. since the number of "covariates" is less than the sample size, logistic/cox models can be fit directly. this mimics the approach in  <cit> .

for the alternative approaches, we also compute the loo cross validation errors. tuning parameters when presented are also chosen via 3-fold cross validation. comparison results are shown in table  <dig> 

we can see from table  <dig> that the sglasso is capable of feature selection at both the cluster level and the within cluster gene level. the number of genes selected is much less than its counterpart from the simple clustering approach and glasso. the lasso is also capable of selecting a small number of genes. especially we note that the number of genes selected by lasso is smaller than by sglasso. for simple data sets such as the colon data, the lasso prediction error is the same as the sglasso. however for data sets that are more difficult to classify , the sglasso prediction error is much smaller. both data sets have also been analyzed by other approaches. for the colon data, roc based approach has prediction error  <dig>   <cit> ; logitboost has classification errors  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> ; and classification tree has classification error  <dig>   <cit> . we note that since different sets of genes are used in those studies, table  <dig> only provides rough comparisons. for the nodal data, in  <cit> , logitboost yields prediction error  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , while classification tree has prediction error  <dig>  and 1-nearest neighbor has prediction error  <dig> .

survival analysis
follicular lymphoma data
follicular lymphoma is the second most common form of non-hodgkin's lymphoma, accounting for about  <dig> percent of all cases. a study was conducted to determine whether the survival probability of patients with follicular lymphoma can be predicted by the gene-expression profiles of the tumors at diagnosis  <cit> . fresh-frozen tumor-biopsy specimens and clinical data from  <dig> untreated patients who had received a diagnosis of follicular lymphoma between  <dig> and  <dig> were obtained. the median age at diagnosis was  <dig> years , and the median follow up time was  <dig>  years . the median follow up time among patients alive at last follow up was  <dig>  years. eight records with missing survival information are excluded from the downstream analysis. detailed experimental protocol can be found in  <cit> .

affymetrix u133a and u133b microarray genechips were used to measure gene expression levels from rna samples. a log <dig> transformation was applied to the affymetrix measurements. we first filter the  <dig> gene measurements with the following criteria:  the max expression value of each gene across  <dig> samples must be greater than  <dig>  .  the max-min should be greater than  <dig>  .  compute correlation coefficients of the uncensored survival times with gene expressions. select the genes whose correlation with survival time is greater than  <dig> . there are  <dig> genes that pass this screening process. we normalize genes across samples to have mean  <dig> and variance  <dig> 

mantel cell lymphoma data
 <cit>  reported a study using microarray expression analysis of mantle cell lymphoma . the primary goal of this study was to discover genes that have good predictive power of patient's survival risk. among  <dig> untreated patients with no history of previous lymphoma included in this study,  <dig> were classified as having mcl, based on established morphologic and immunophenotypic criteria. survival times of  <dig> patients were available and other  <dig> patients were censored. the median survival time was  <dig>  years . lymphochip dna microarrays  <cit>  were used to quantify mrna expression in the lymphoma samples from the  <dig> patients. the gene expression data that contain expression values of  <dig> cdna elements are available at  <cit> .

we pre-process the data as follows to exclude noises and gain further stability:  compute the variances of all gene expressions;  compute correlation coefficients of the uncensored survival times with gene expressions; and  select the genes with variances larger than the first quartile and with correlation coefficients larger than  <dig> .  <dig> out of  <dig> genes  pass the above initial screening. we standardize these genes to have zero mean and unit variance.

we use the k-means method and gap statistic in the cluster analysis.  <dig>  and  <dig>  clusters are established. plot similar to figure  <dig> can be obtained and omitted here. model estimation and prediction features are also provided in table  <dig>  we show in tables  <dig> and  <dig> the genes included in the final models.

for the follicular data, gene 23098_x_a is associated with tumor protein p <dig>  in transfected cells and kshv-infected b lymphoma cells, kshv-encoded latency-associated nuclear antigen  expression stimulates degradation of tumor suppressors von hippel-lindau and p <dig>  in a recent case study with a japanese girl who had eec <dig> and developed diffuse large b-cell type non-hodgkin lymphoma, researchers identified heterozygosity for a 1079a-g transition in exon  <dig> of the tp73l gene, resulting in a germline asp312-to-gly  mutation. gene 223333_s_a is a member of the angiopoietin/angiopoietin-like gene family and encodes a glycosylated, secreted protein with a fibrinogen c-terminal domain. the encoded protein may play a role in several cancers and it also has been shown to prevent the metastatic process by inhibiting vascular activity as well as tumor cell motility and invasiveness. gene 224357_s_a encodes a member of the membrane-spanning 4a gene family. members of this nascent protein family are characterized by common structural features and similar intron/exon splice boundaries and display unique expression patterns among hematopoietic cells and nonlymphoid tissues. chemokines  are a group of small , mostly basic, structurally related molecules that regulate cell trafficking of various types of leukocytes through interactions with a subset of 7-transmembrane, g protein-coupled receptors. chemokines also play fundamental roles in the development, homeostasis, and function of the immune system, and they have effects on cells of the central nervous system as well as on endothelial cells involved in angiogenesis or angiostasis. serpin al  has an invasion-promoting effect in anaplastic large cell lymphoma. gene 216950_s_a has official symbol fcgr1a. findings showed that both fcgamma ria and fcgammariia mediated enhanced dengue virus immune complex infectivity but that fcgammariia appeared to do so far more effectively. trpm4-mediated  depolarization modulates ca2+ oscillations, with downstream effects on cytokine production in t lymphocytes. the protein encoded by gene 210973_s_a is a member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor  family, where amino acid sequence is highly conserved between members and throughout evolution. chromosomal aberrations involving this gene are associated with stem cell myeloproliferative disorder and stem cell leukemia lymphoma syndrome. fgfr- <dig> is expressed in early hematopoietic/endothelial precursor cells, as well as in a subpool of endothelial cells in tumor vessels. gene 227697_at encodes a member of the stat-induced stat inhibitor , also known as suppressor of cytokine signaling , family. over expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling  <dig> is associated with anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

genes identified in the mcl study also have sound biological basis. when the positive cells are treated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase c , a significant decrease in both stain intensity and percentage of positive cells is demonstrated by immunofluorescence. the protein encoded by gene hs.  <dig> is the fourth major glycoprotein of the platelet surface and serves as a receptor for thrombospondin in platelets and various cell lines. since thrombospondins are widely distributed proteins involved in a variety of adhesive processes, this protein may have important functions as a cell adhesion molecule. mutations in this gene cause platelet glycoprotein deficiency. the protein encoded by gene hs. <dig> belongs to the dual specificity protein phosphatase family. it was identified as a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, and has been shown to interact with, and dephosphorylate cdk <dig> kinase, thus prevent the activation of cdk <dig> kinase. this gene was reported to be deleted, mutated, or overexpressed in several kinds of cancers. studies show top2a  is a proliferation marker, indicator of drug sensitivity, and prognostic factor in mantle cell lymphoma. this gene encodes a dna topoisomerase, an enzyme that controls and alters the topologic states of dna during transcription. the gene encoding this enzyme functions as the target for several anticancer agents and a variety of mutations in this gene have been associated with the development of drug resistance. reduced activity of this enzyme may also play a role in ataxia-telangiectasia. gene hs. <dig> encodes a protein that associates with the centromere-kinetochore complex. autoantibodies against this protein have been found in patients with cancer or graft versus host disease. dna pol theta  has a specialized function in lymphocytes and in tumor progression. gene hs. <dig> encodes tumor suppressor proteins. the protein encoded by gene hs.  <dig> catalyzes the transfer of galactose to lactosylceramide to form globotriaosylceramide, which has been identified as the p antigen of the p blood group system. plg  has the potential to simultaneously regulate calcium signaling pathways and regulate phi via an association with nhe <dig> linked to dpp iv, necessary for tumor cell proliferation and invasiveness.

we show the prediction comparison in table  <dig>  we can again see that the models obtained under sglasso are much smaller than those from the simple cluster approach and glasso. however the sglasso models are larger than their lasso counterparts. for both data sets, the proposed sglasso has the largest logrank statistics, indicating the best prediction performance. for the follicular data, only lasso and sglasso have logrank statistics with p-value less than  <dig> . the glasso and simple approaches cannot properly predict survival based expressions. for the mcl data, all approaches have logrank statistics with p-value less than  <dig> , with the largest logrank statistic from the sglasso.

discussion
remark: clustering method selection
gene expression clustering can be based on many approaches including the k-means, hierarchical, self-organizing map, and model based methods  <cit> , among many others. without making specific data assumptions, there do not exist optimal clustering method. the proposed k-means approach has been extensively used in microarray study. it is attractive because of its computational simplicity and optimality under the normal distribution assumption. we have also analyzed the four data sets using other clustering schemes including hierarchical clustering. our studies show that other approaches generate comparable or worse prediction results than the k-means approach. since the k-means method yields satisfactory estimation and prediction results for the four data sets and other data , we focus on the k-means approach only. a comprehensive comparison of different clustering is interesting but beyond the scope of this paper.

we propose using the gap statistic for selecting the optimal number of clusters. empirical studies in  <cit>  and this paper show that it can lead to satisfactory results. we note again that there is no best selection method for number of clusters, unless stronger data assumptions are made. we refer to  <cit>  for comprehensive discussions of gene clustering.

remark: prediction evaluation
in our examples, we carry out gene screening before analysis. the goal of such screening is to remove noisy genes and obtain more stable models. gene screening has been employed in almost all microarray studies. we note that such screening may lead to bias in the prediction evaluation, since all records have been used in the screening. however since the number of genes passed screening is still large, the bias in the prediction is expected to be small. especially all four approaches listed in table  <dig> use the same sets of genes. so comparisons in table  <dig> should be fair.

remark: two-step gene selection
the proposed sglasso is a two-step approach. another two-step gene selection approach is the supervised principal component analysis . significant differences exist between the sglasso and other two-step approaches like spca. in other two-step approaches, the first supervised screening step considers all genes simultaneously. the cluster structure is ignored, whereas the main merit of the sglasso is the usage of the cluster structure. moreover, in spca, the selected features are the principal components. although they may have satisfactory prediction performance, biological interpretations may not be clear. as a comparison, clear biological interpretations of gene identification results are available as shown in the results section.

CONCLUSIONS
gene selection is essential in classification or survival analysis using high dimensional microarray data. such selection can generate parsimonious, stable models with interpretable estimates. in this article, we propose the sglasso approach. this approach explicitly takes into account the cluster structure and carries out feature selection at both the gene and cluster levels. applications of this approach to four data sets show that it can produce parsimonious predictive models with satisfactory prediction performance.

compared to available approaches, the sglasso is the first to consider penalized gene selection at both the cluster level and the within cluster level. compared to individual gene selection methods, the sglasso is capable of taking cluster information into consideration. this makes it possible to reveal the associations between diseases and gene clusters. with the proposed approach, we can identify co-regulated genes which are jointly significantly associated with diseases. compared to simple cluster based methods, sglasso carries out the additional within cluster selection. this leads to a small number of genes within each cluster. so beyond identifying influential clusters, the proposed approach can also identify the genes that actually cause the association. from a scientific point of view, identifying important genes  is critical.

as we point out, gene clusters can also be constructed based on biological information  <cit> . we should use such information whenever available. however we also note that such pathway information is far from complete or not available for many genes. in the absence of such information, we can use clustering methods to divide genes into groups. it is of interest to compare results based on statistical clustering with those based on biological clustering, when full pathway information is available. however, such empirical studies is beyond the scope of the current paper and will be pursued in later studies.
