BACKGROUND
streptomycetes are common saprophytic soil bacteria that constitute some of the most proficient producers of naturally occurring therapeutic molecules like antibiotics, immunosuppressants and anti-cancer agents  <cit> . the regulation of biosynthesis of these compounds has therefore evoked considerable interest among researchers. it is well-known that antibiotic biosynthesis in bacteria is generally elicited as a physiological response to a variety of environmental stimuli including high cell density, nutritional imbalance and/or presence of stress-inducing agents. in streptomycetes, evidence hinting at the interplay between stress signals and antibiotic synthesis have emerged with the findings that mutants of several streptomyces coelicolor sigma factors implicated in stress-response are also perturbed in antibiotics production  <cit> . growth limitations resulting from nutritional imbalances like nitrogen or phosphate starvation are also known to trigger antibiotic synthesis  <cit> . yet, despite extensive efforts aimed at elucidating antibiotic regulatory pathways, the exact chain of molecular events leading from sensing of stress or nutritional starvation signal to the eventual activation of antibiotic pathways remains largely obscure.

years of genetic research, recently aided by the availability of complete genome sequence of s. coelicolor  <cit> , has identified several key players involved in the regulation of secondary metabolism in s. coelicolor. one such set of genes is the afsk-afsr-afss system that globally controls antibiotic synthesis under certain conditions . when afsk, one of numerous serine/threonine kinases in s. coelicolor, is autophosphorylated, it phosphorylates afsr. phosphorylated afsr has enhanced dna-binding activity specific to the promoter of afss and positively regulates its transcription. afss is then proposed to lead to the onset of antibiotic production in an as yet unknown manner. recent studies have uncovered some of the upstream events leading to the activation of this signaling pathway. it has now been proposed that the autophosphorylation of afsk is caused by increased levels of s-adenosyl-l-methionine, a probable intracellular signaling factor  <cit> , and that this phosphorylation is modulated by another protein, kbpa  <cit> . in addition, phosphorylation of afsr by other serine/threonine kinases like pkag and afsl have also been demonstrated  <cit> . an understanding of the signaling cascade downstream of the afsk-afsr-afss system, however, continues to remain elusive.

in this study we employ dna microarrays to perform a genome-wide transcriptome profiling of a s. coelicolor afss disruption mutant. overexpression of afss in s. coelicolor and s. lividans had previously been shown to significantly enhance actinorhodin synthesis  <cit>  while disruption of afss diminished actinorhodin production  <cit> . we show here that the regulatory implications of afss are not limited to modulation of antibiotic synthesis but extend to the control of certain phosphate starvation response, and nitrogen and sulfate metabolism genes as well. this suggests a far more pleiotropic role for afss than that theorized by our current understanding and provides an important link between nutritional stress and activation of antibiotic pathways in s. coelicolor. furthermore, clustering and comparative transcriptome analysis of wild-type and this mutant enabled us to gain insights into the biological functions of certain poorly annotated genes.

RESULTS
construction of an afss mutant
the gene afss encodes a relatively small 63-amino-acid "sigma-like" protein containing three repeats of a short 12-amino acid segment that are thought to be crucial for its activity  <cit> . to investigate the physiological role of afss in s. coelicolor m <dig>  a disruption mutant was constructed by replacing two of these tandem repeats with an apramycin resistance cassette. the deleted segment was  <dig> bp in length  and the resulting strain was designated as ysk <dig> 

growth and antibiotic production kinetics
these observations were confirmed by performing an independent biological replicate culture. genetic complementation of afss in ysk <dig> restored antibiotic synthesis . taken together, these findings reaffirm the pleiotropic role of afss in regulation of antibiotic synthesis in s. coelicolor.

microarray analysis
whole-genome microarrays containing duplicate probes for ~96% of the predicted orfs in s. coelicolor were fabricated as reported earlier  <cit> . fluorescently labeled cdna prepared from total rna extracts isolated during various growth stages were used in hybridizations. the sampling points chosen for m <dig> were  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h; for ysk <dig>  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h were chosen. genomic dna  was used as a universal reference for all hybridizations. the relative fluorescence intensity of cdna to gdna, referred to hereafter as the 'log <dig> expression value', is thus an estimate of transcript abundance. hybridizations were generally performed as duplicates and outlier data points from four spots  were filtered out using a mean ±  <dig>  times standard deviation cut-off. key conclusions reported here were confirmed by additional hybridizations performed on the biological replicate culture.

identification of kinetically perturbed genes in afss mutant
after normalization, the overall log <dig> expression values for both m <dig> and ysk <dig> samples ranged approximately from - <dig> to + <dig>  we focused our initial attention on transcripts expressed at moderate to high levels because they show more prominent dynamics allowing higher confidence in identification of differentially expressed genes. therefore,  <dig> genes whose log <dig> expression values rose above zero in at least 10% of all sampled time-points in either strain were considered for initial analysis.

to identify kinetically perturbed genes in ysk <dig>  we first performed a linear interpolation of the time-series data to obtain corresponding values at every time-point in the two series. we then employed two approaches to identify genes with altered profiles in ysk <dig>  in the first approach, we calculated a 'difference profile' by subtracting log <dig> expression value of genes in ysk <dig> from corresponding values in m <dig>  these 'difference profiles' were then analyzed using principal component analysis . two major patterns  emerged from this analysis, each displaying a significant deviation from zero at different growth stages. principal component  <dig>  which accounted for ~38% of all the variance in the 'difference profiles'  accounted for genes that had progressively higher expression levels in m <dig> compared to ysk <dig> as the culture entered stationary phase. principal component  <dig>  indicated that some genes also had a tendency to display a higher relative expression in m <dig> between  <dig> h and  <dig> h but lower levels thereafter with respect to ysk <dig>  to identify genes that had extreme values along each of these component axes, we plotted pc- <dig> versus pc- <dig> for the selected set moderate/high expression genes . as we describe in later sections, certain families of genes cluster together in this plot, suggesting coordinate differential regulation for these genes in m <dig> and ysk4425

in a second complementary approach to identify genes with altered profiles in ysk <dig>  we calculated euclidean distance between gene profiles in m <dig> and ysk <dig>  normalized by the total number of sampling points . higher euclidean distances imply that gene expression patterns in the two strains are dissimilar. in general, many genes with high euclidean distance – greater than mean  plus  <dig>  times the standard deviation  – also had higher component along pc- <dig> and/or pc- <dig>  these euclidean distance estimates were used as a means to verify findings from principal component analysis and are reported in relevant tables in later sections.

validation of microarray results using qrt-pcr
quantitative real-time pcrs were performed on reverse transcribed rna samples to independently validate the microarray results. a total of  <dig> genes  were chosen for analysis. relative expression levels from qrt-pcr for samples  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h in m <dig> and  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h in ysk <dig> with respect to the  <dig> h of m <dig> were plotted against those obtained from microarray experiments . the comparison indicates a good concordance between qrt-pcr and microarray results. we note that the range of dynamics for relative log <dig> ratios obtained from qrt-pcr  was significantly higher than that from microarray , indicating that qrt-pcrs are more sensitive particularly in low expression ranges. this probably reflects on the pearson's correlation coefficient for the plot, resulting in lower value than what could be expected.

functional classification of genes with altered expression profiles in afss mutant
principal component analysis of microarray data not only identified a set of differentially expressed genes in ysk <dig>  but also enabled their classification into coordinately perturbed subgroups. each sub-group then represented a distinct pattern of differential expression; the two most commonly observed patterns were briefly mentioned earlier. further analysis revealed that genes exhibiting each of these patterns also fell within a handful of functional categories  suggesting a role for afss in coordinating those functions. these and other related genes are discussed below with reference to figure 2c.

antibiotic biosynthesis genes
in r5- medium, s. coelicolor m <dig> begins synthesis of the polyketide antibiotic, actinorhodin, nearly  <dig> h after entering the stationary phase; antibiotic titers continue to rise in the culture until onset of cell death characterized by gradual fragmentation of mycelia. microarray analysis revealed that genes belonging to the actinorhodin biosynthesis cluster in m <dig> were up-regulated slightly ahead of the appearance of blue pigment in culture supernatants. in ysk <dig>  consistent with the phenotypic observations, we found that these genes were not activated at any stage. by the nature of their profiles in m <dig> and ysk <dig>  these genes had a high component along pc- <dig> discussed earlier . a direct comparison of the gene expression profiles are shown in figure 4a. this observation clearly indicates that afss exerts its control of actinorhodin synthesis through direct or indirect transcriptional regulation of the relevant biosynthetic genes.

in addition to actinorhodin, at least two other antibiotics, undecylprodigiosin and calcium-dependent antibiotic  are synthesized by s. coelicolor. the expression profiles of both these antibiotic biosynthesis clusters showed a bimodal distribution in m <dig> with an early peak at  <dig> h and a later gradual peak between  <dig> h and  <dig> h. in ysk <dig>  while the first peak was present at the same time-point as m <dig>  the second peak for many genes were either absent or delayed . these profiles also corroborate with the phenotypic observation that undecylprodigiosin accumulated to a lower extent in ysk <dig> compared to m <dig> particularly in late stationary phase.

phosphate starvation response and other similarly regulated genes
analysis of figure 2c revealed that many genes with a high value along pc- <dig> were either annotated as phosphate starvation response elements or were conspicuously related to phosphate metabolism. these genes also displayed distinct bimodal peaks – at around  <dig> h and  <dig> h – in m <dig>  a profile search based on correlation coefficient yielded additional genes with similar differential profiles in m <dig> and ysk <dig> . a total of  <dig> genes that belonged to this category along with their euclidean distance values are listed in table  <dig>  they include genes encoding the two-component system – phorp , phosphate specific transporters – pstscab, alkaline phosphatases  and glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase  homologs . a large locus  consisting of several hypothetical or membrane proteins as well as those involved in putative phosphorus-free teichuronic acid biosynthesis  which may substitute for phosphate-rich teichoic acids in cell envelope polymers also belong to this category. a recent study discovered that these genes are phop-dependent  <cit> . in addition, several genes encoding twin-arginine translocation  dependent exported proteins  identified in an earlier study  <cit>  also belonged to this category. several other genes encoding secreted proteins, nucleases and other hypothetical proteins were also included in this cluster . by virtue of their similarity in expression in m <dig> and differential regulation in ysk <dig>  we postulate that many of these elements likely belong to the phosphate starvation response system. transient up-regulation of these genes in m <dig> might reflect a concerted effort by s. coelicolor to counter phosphate starvation by active transport, scavenging, and phosphate regeneration through catabolism from intracellular sources like nucleotides.

† euclidean distance normalized with number of time-points. compare with the average euclidean distance  for all genes =  <dig>  and standard deviation  =  <dig> . euclidean distances ≥ μ +  <dig>  σ indicates significant differential expression. however, there may be other genes which have lower euclidean distances due to low expression levels. these genes were identified by profile similarity search and difference between m <dig> and ysk <dig> were confirmed by visual inspection.

it is interesting to note that disruption of afss led to perturbation of the phosphate starvation response system. figure 5a indicates that the second of the characteristic bimodal peaks for these genes were either absent or delayed in ysk <dig>  earlier studies in s. coelicolor and s. lividans using deletion mutants of phorp  <cit> , ppk  <cit> , and psts  <cit>  largely concluded that disruption of pho system components caused a premature phosphate-starvation-like situation leading to overproduction of actinorhodin in these strains. one hypothesis put forward was that phosphorylated phop represses transcription of afss and inhibits actinorhodin synthesis until a time when, perhaps, a more severe form of phosphate starvation or another independent mechanism sets in to relieve this repression  <cit> . however, contrary to expectations from this hypothesis, we observed here that a delay or inactivation of phosphate starvation response genes in stationary phase was accompanied by a complete abolishment of actinorhodin synthesis. moreover, although it has been hypothesized that afss might be under the control of phop, our results indicate that presence of afss is required for normal expression of phorp in stationary phase. therefore, for the previous hypothesis to be valid, it appears that some form of feedback regulation must exist, whereby afss and phorp can regulate the transcription of each other.

nitrogen metabolism genes and their chromosomal neighbors
the enzyme glutamine synthetase  catalyzes the conversion of nh4+ to glutamine, a key step in nitrogen assimilation particularly under low nitrogen conditions. although, single copies of gs-encoding genes are typically found in most bacteria, the genome of s. coelicolor encodes five gs-type enzymes, two of which  have so far been confirmed to be involved in nitrogen metabolism  <cit> . in addition, several other genes, including an ammonium transporter  and a signal transduction protein pii  are implicated in nitrogen assimilation  <cit> . our microarray analysis revealed that, consistent with previous observations  <cit> , glna, the probable housekeeping glutamine synthetase in s. coelicolor was constitutively expressed at high levels in both m <dig> and ysk <dig> . however, we found that glnii, glnk and amtb clustered together with actinorhodin biosynthesis genes in figure 2c indicating differential expression in strain ysk <dig>  like actinorhodin biosynthesis genes, these were activated during stationary phase in m <dig> but remained dormant throughout the culture period in ysk <dig> . interestingly, a phop-deletion mutant also perturbed the expression of glnii, glnk and amtb indicating a link between phosphate and nitrogen starvation response  <cit> ; but, in contrast to our observations, these genes were up-regulated in the absence of phop in those experiments. the effect of glnii expression on antibiotic synthesis is, however, consistent with previous reports. it has been shown previously that a mutation in rpob, the rna polymerase β chain, leads to a remarkable increase in glnii expression as well as the induction of actinorhodin biosynthesis in an otherwise non-producing strain of s. lividans  <cit> . also, a recent report found that a homolog of s. coelicolor glnr  in amycolatopsis mediterranei, when cloned into s. coelicolor, had pleiotropic effects on host antibiotics production  <cit> . these findings suggest that nitrogen starvation response is linked to antibiotic synthesis, and our results propose a central role for afss in coordinating this response.

in addition to known nitrogen metabolism genes, certain other chromosomally linked genes also exhibited similar differential profiles in m <dig> and ysk <dig> . one of them, sco <dig>  located immediately downstream of and co-transcribed with glnii  <cit> , encodes a putative hypothetical protein with a signal peptide sequence. further downstream, sco <dig> and sco <dig>  encoding putative secreted and membrane-bound proteins respectively as well as three upstream genes , including a marr-type transcriptional regulator were similarly regulated. interestingly, mutational and dna-binding studies of sco <dig> and sco <dig>  <cit>  concluded that these were not involved in nitrogen metabolism. although it has been shown that deletion of sco <dig> does not affect gs activity in s. coelicolor, one cannot exclude the possibility that these genes are controlled by a common regulator. our data suggest that transcription of all these genes are either directly or indirectly activated by afss activity. it is known that glnrii  is the exclusive transcriptional activator of glnii while both glnrii and its homolog, glnr bind to the promoter of amtb-glnk-glnd operon  <cit> . it is therefore likely that the presence of afss induces their expression or, perhaps, enhances their dna-binding ability in an as yet unknown way.

sulfate assimilation genes
a closer inspection of figure 2c revealed that a probable thiosulfate sulfurtransferase  had a reasonably high component along pc- <dig>  although the 'difference profile' of this gene was similar to many phosphate starvation induced genes discussed earlier, the absolute profile in each of m <dig> and ysk <dig> did not resemble them. instead the profile was characterized by a sharp but transient up-regulation of cysa by nearly 60-fold at ~ <dig> h in m145; the mutant, however, lacked this peak. a genome-wide similarity search yielded  <dig> additional sulfate assimilation genes each having the same  distinct pattern in both m <dig> and ysk <dig> . we note that these profiles could be reproduced in an independent biological replicate culture and that a representative profile from this set was verified using qrt-pcr. several genes organized as possible operons including cysteine biosynthesis enzymes  belonged to this category. certain aliphatic sulfonate assimilation proteins  located immediately downstream of cysihcdn also displayed a similar pattern. an earlier study  <cit>  had reported that several of these genes were activated upon osmotic shock and this activation was mediated by a stress response sigma factor, σb . yet, many other genes reported to be under the control of σb were not affected in ysk <dig>  thus it appears that while σb and afss may each have a broad set of genes under their control, they probably operate cooperatively in a direct or indirect manner to activate a subset of those genes.

other differentially regulated genes
in addition to antibiotic and nutrition starvation genes described above, several other gene profiles were altered in ysk <dig>  however, these genes might not fit into one of the two major patterns discovered using pca. hence, euclidean distances were used as primary indicators of differential expression to identify additional genes perturbed in ysk <dig>  also, unlike earlier cases, not all of the identified genes could be grouped together into functional classes. therefore, in the absence of additional confidence through similar behavior from functionally related genes, we resorted to a stricter statistical test based on significance analysis of time-series data using profiles from biological replicate cultures . this analysis provides a q-value for every gene, an estimate of false discovery rate when all genes with lower q-values are called as differentially expressed. a q-value less than  <dig>  was taken as an indication of significant differential expression. we note that at this confidence, the p-value for expression profiles were less than  <dig> . these calculations were performed in addition to the euclidean distance estimates described earlier. genes that passed the euclidean distance cutoff  in both replicate cultures as well as a q-value cutoff  from the significance analysis test were further inspected manually and reported in table  <dig>

*q-value from significance analysis of time-series data. values less than  <dig>  are statistically significant.

as with most cases discussed earlier, the effect of afss mutation was not visible until mid/late stationary phase for many of these genes. among them is a major s. coelicolor catalase  which was up-regulated by nearly eight-fold in m <dig> during stationary phase but displayed a less prominent increase in ysk <dig>  a few genes downstream, sco <dig> and sco <dig>  which are categorized as secondary metabolism genes  displayed a similar pattern. in fact, several genes in the deoxysugar synthase/glycosyl transferase cluster  were similarly regulated  although many did not meet our statistical criteria due to smaller fold-changes. the stationary phase activation of another set of genes  organized as a single operon was also attenuated in ysk <dig>  these genes have previously been implicated in control of glucose-dependent activation of actinorhodin biosynthesis in s. coelicolor  <cit> . interestingly, carbon source dependent modulation of afss has been shown earlier to be responsible for activation of antibiotic synthesis in s. lividans  <cit> . two additional proteins, sco2195– <dig>  encoding a hypothetical and membrane bound protein respectively were also significantly suppressed in ysk <dig> during stationary phase.

the "sigma-like" domains of afss do not contain any obvious dna-binding sites. yet, as described here, a large set of genes with diverse functions appear to be under its control. this prompted us to search for possible transcriptional regulators differentially expressed in ysk <dig> as these could be the potential mediators through which afss may exert its control on downstream targets. our analysis indicated that expression profile of a putative ecf-sigma factor  was significantly altered in ysk <dig> . consistent with this finding, a recent study had identified this gene as a positive regulator of actinorhodin synthesis in s. coelicolor  <cit> . moreover, it was also found that activation of sco <dig> accompanied the up-regulation of afss in a redz over-expressing strain  <cit> . the expression profiles of another putative regulator, sco <dig> and its upstream neighbor, sco <dig>  were also dramatically altered in ysk <dig>  although these genes have not been previously studied in detail, it is known that sco <dig> is homologous to a negative regulator of differentiation and antibiotic synthesis, nsda, in s. coelicolor  <cit> . in addition to these regulators, we note that another sigma factor  and its cognate anti-sigma factor  were both suppressed in one of the replicate cultures in ysk <dig> during stationary phase ; the difference in the other culture, though, was not as drastic. however, this observation might still be interesting because an rsua deletion strain was significantly delayed in actinorhodin synthesis in s. coelicolor  <cit> . we also note that sigu as well as sco <dig> and sco <dig> were recently reported as differentially expressed in a phop-deletion strain  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
afss-like proteins are relatively rare in nature. thus far, only a handful of related streptomycetes like s. lividans, s. griseus and s. noursei are known to encode such proteins. with no precedent analyses from model organisms like escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis or closer relatives like corynebacteria and mycobacteria, it should, perhaps, come as no surprise that even the basic molecular function of afss has not been elucidated yet. in this work, we have demonstrated that afss regulates both antibiotic synthesis and nutrition starvation response genes in s. coelicolor. over  <dig> genes were perturbed in the afss disruption strain. an overwhelming majority of these genes were down-regulated in the mutant strain indicating that afss is primarily a direct or indirect positive regulator of transcription for numerous downstream genes. a common thread linking almost all these observations was that the phenotypic and transcriptional effects of the mutation were not evident until the onset of stationary phase. in this aspect, afss resembles alterative sigma factors, many of which have been implicated in stress response and stationary phase adaptation in bacteria. in fact, afss is annotated as a "sigma-like" protein because it contains certain conserved residues of the domain  <dig> of sigma factors  <cit> . this domain, containing three α-helices, mainly interacts with the β-subunit of rna polymerase and acts as a linker between domains  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, ecf sigma factors,  <dig> of which are found in s. coelicolor, lack this domain and instead contain only a short stretch of linker segment. thus, an intriguing possibility that may, perhaps, be tested in future studies is if afss acts cooperatively with one or more of s. coelicolor ecf sigma factors.

one possible hypothesis that can be put forth from this work is that the regulation of actinorhodin synthesis by afss is mediated by phosphate starvation genes. thus, in the absence of afss, the phosphate starvation mechanism is impaired leading to the abolishment of actinorhodin synthesis. an alternative hypothesis would suggest that afss activates actinorhodin synthesis in an as yet unknown manner, but, under the conditions tested, antibiotic biosynthesis requires sequestering of cellular resources through expression of phosphate, sulfate and nitrogen metabolism genes. thus, abolishment of actinorhodin synthesis by disruption of afss obviates the need for expression of these genes. a third possible hypothesis would be that the activation of nutrient starvation genes and antibiotic biosynthesis genes are two unrelated activities of afss. further work is needed to test these hypotheses. irrespective of these possibilities and the mode of action of afss, we have shown that it is a master regulator of both antibiotic synthesis and nutrition starvation response genes in s. coelicolor. the findings reported here should provide some important clues to unraveling the intricate antibiotic regulatory machinery in s. coelicolor and related microbes.
