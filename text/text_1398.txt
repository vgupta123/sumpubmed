BACKGROUND
alternative splicing, the production of multiple mrna isoforms from a single gene, is critical to the generation of biological complexity and the differentiation of both tissues and species  <cit> . consequently, there has been great interest in recent years in developing in silico models of the splicing code – the interactions of cis and trans regulatory elements – from simpler biological features such as genetic sequence, nucleosome positions and rna secondary structure  <cit> . ideally, a splicing model should be able to make several types of predictions: the ‘absolute’ percent-spliced-in
Ψ of any exon in various tissues, Δ
Ψ between tissues, the impact of mutations on Ψ  <cit> , and binding sites for rna-binding proteins  that affect splicing  <cit> . notably, none of these goals requires the model to actually mimic the inner workings of the cell, and most metrics used to evaluate the quality of a model’s predictions do not take into account its biophysical fidelity.

it has long been known that alternative splicing is associated with modified evolutionary conservation of both exons  <cit>  and their flanking introns  <cit> . modrek and lee  <cit>  found that newly created exons  have low Ψ and hypothesized that this served a useful evolutionary purpose, by allowing the exon to accumulate beneficial mutations without the organism losing the benefits of the original protein in the meantime. sorek and ast  <cit>  noted that alternatively spliced exons are disproportionately likely to have conserved flanking introns, and identified that one abundant k-mer in conserved downstream introns had known cis-regulatory properties.

the role of intronic conservation extends to tissue-specific splicing regulation as well. sugnet et al.  <cit>  found that exons with high Δ
Ψ between brain or muscle and other tissues tended to have highly conserved flanking introns. yeo et al.  <cit>  discovered that conserved fox and nova motifs in introns are associated with higher Ψ in brain tissue. wang et al.  <cit>  found that exons with ‘switch-like’ Δ
Ψ>  <dig>  between any pair of tissues have increased conservation in flanking introns.

computational models of splicing often depend on conservation for their accuracy. a previous study on alternative splicing modelling  <cit>  found that a metric of model quality increased by one-third when conservation was incorporated into the model. the most accurate existing models of alternative splicing  <cit>  also rely heavily on conservation. these models train neural networks on over  <dig> ‘hand-crafted’ features, including motif counts, position weight matrix  correspondences, sequence lengths, rna secondary structure, nucleosome positions, and translatability and frameshift features. in these models, conservation is used both in raw form, as averages over the first  <dig> bp of each flanking intron , and to weight motif counts. the underlying assumption is that conservation is mostly useful to indicate the overall level of cis elements in flanking introns  and to determine which occurrences of interesting motifs are actually relevant for splicing .

this article introduces several computational models of splicing that depend on conservation, with the goal of understanding the evolution of alternative splicing. some previous studies of alternative splicing and conservation  analyze the conservation of alternative splicing patterns between species. instead, we prefer to focus on the conservation of the sequence near alternative splice sites, as this incorporates flanking introns into the analysis and provides more fine-grained insights into the differing roles of conservation in various regions of the sequence.

RESULTS
we constructed several computational models of alternative splicing in humans from rna-seq data and compared the accuracy of their absolute Ψ predictions, measured as the ability to distinguish cassette exons with high Ψ  from those with low Ψ  for all tissues simultaneously . strikingly, one technique which surpasses all previous techniques ) does not use any hand-crafted features at all: instead, it learns directly from the sequence and conservation track . no additional information is provided besides the locations of the splice sites.

however, even this minimalist model, which we call consnet, or conservation-weighted convolutional neural network, is substantially more complex than what is necessary to predict Ψ. nearly equivalent performance was obtained with a very simple neural network model trained on just two features for each exon: the conservation on the intronic side of each of its splice junctions  normalized by the average conservation over the first  <dig> bp of the corresponding flanking introns , hereinafter called the junc/avg model ). .

when trained in a simple logistic regression with all of the hand-crafted features from previous models, these two features have the highest weights , emphasizing that the junc/avg features are individually more useful than any previous features. further, adding the junc/avg features to the previous features improves auc by  <dig>  %  and ), indicating that junc/avg provides substantial new information not captured by any previous features. in particular, junc/avg is not merely a proxy for splice site strength: a deep learning model trained to predict Ψ from the maxentscan  <cit>  splice site scores of the two alternative splice sites and the two neighbouring constitutive splice sites achieves an auc of only  <dig>  ±  <dig> , subtantially lower than the junc/avg model.

while the junc/avg model is worse than  <cit>  at predicting the absolute Ψ values of events with intermediate Ψ , it still performs respectably well even at this task.

the junc/avg model appears to be an exceptionally concise summary of phastcons conservation information: it performs as well as a neural network trained on the full  <dig> bp of intronic conservation  and ); and it is the simplest model to do so, as junction and average conservation individually perform far worse /).

the utility of junction and average conservation is not limited to phastcons. gerp++  <cit> , a measure of purifying selection derived from multiple sequence alignments, is not normalized to be between  <dig> and  <dig> so the heuristic of dividing junction by average conservation is not applicable. however, a model trained to predict Ψ from the upstream and downstream gerp++ junction and average scores individually  obtains an auc of  <dig>  ±  <dig> , comparable to using phastcons.

nonetheless, there are limits to the power of conservation. the junc/avg model performs worse than existing models at predicting Δ
Ψ between tissues: the spearman correlation between its predictions and the true tissue differences, concatenated over all tissue pairs and excluding pairs of measurements that are statistically indistinguishable >|Δ
Ψ|), is a mere  <dig> , compared to  <dig>  using the method described in  <cit> . even so, the junc/avg model does well at predicting Ψ for exons with substantial tissue differences in inclusion , with an auc of  <dig>  ±  <dig> .

the junc/avg model is also too simple to predict differences in Ψ due to mutations, not least because it does not have access to the sequence and thus has no conception of what a mutation is. even for absolute Ψ prediction, the sequence contains information beyond what is provided by conservation: giving the model access to the sequence improves auc  by  <dig>  %  and ).

on a more fundamental level, this model does not capture as much biophysical information as previous models, which can predict the effect of trans elements on splicing. xiong et al.  <cit>  found that removing muscleblind-like rbps from their model had a similar effect on Ψ to knocking down these rbps in actual cells.

intronic splicing regulation occurs predominantly within  <dig> bp of the alternative splice sites
comparing fig.  <dig> and , we see that consnet performs worse at predicting absolute Ψ from the  <dig> bp at each end of the cassette exon than from the first  <dig> bp of each flanking intron, perhaps because exonic conservation is not a pure indicator of splicing regulation as it is confounded by effects on protein function. with this in mind, we focus on intronic splicing regulation rather than exonic regulation for the remainder of our analysis.

is there anything special about  <dig> bp? figure  <dig> shows the correlation between junction/average conservation and Ψ as the averaging window is increased from  <dig> to  <dig> bp into the flanking intron. for upstream introns, the maximum correlation occurs at an averaging window of  <dig> bp; for downstream introns,  <dig> bp. beyond these distances, incorporating additional distal conservation information into the average only degrades the prediction.
fig.  <dig> most intronic splicing regulation occurs within  <dig> bp of the splice site. correlation between junction/average conservation and tissue-averaged Ψ as the averaging window is increased from  <dig> to  <dig> bp of the flanking introns nearest the splice site. the correlation peaks at  <dig> bp for the upstream splice site and  <dig> bp for the downstream splice site




to confirm that using only the first  <dig> bp of each flanking intron does not miss much information, note that once consnet is provided with these  <dig> bp, it does not help the prediction any further to provide it with the conservation and sequence of an entire  <dig> bp on both the intronic and exonic sides of the splice sites and the same 768-bp region around the two nearest constitutive splice sites  and ).

under the assumption that conserved sequences near introns are predominantly splicing regulators, these results provide evidence that most intronic splicing regulation occurs within about  <dig> bp of the splice site in both upstream and downstream introns. this does not negate the fact that some important intronic splicing regulation occurs further away from the splice site  <cit> ; however, such distal regulation appears to be the exception rather than the rule.

new exons, and old exons with conserved cis elements, have reduced Ψ
we next investigated why junc/avg conservation is significantly more informative than either junc or avg on their own. fig.  <dig> shows a scatter plot of upstream junction versus average conservation for high Ψ  and low Ψ  events . the events are divided into  <dig> regimes based on whether they have high  or low junction or average conservation:

the size of the fourth category, with low junction and high average conservation, is negligible with only  <dig>  % of events. we note that old and new are relative terms and are on the time scale of the most recent common ancestor of the species included in the conservation track.

as seen from the pie charts of fig.  <dig>  events in old- overwhelmingly have high Ψ, those in new mostly have low Ψ, and those in old+ are evenly split between high and low Ψ with most exons exhibiting differential regulation between cell types . this explains why junc/avg is so effective: junction conservation distinguishes low Ψ new from high Ψ old-, average conservation distinguishes high Ψ old- from lower Ψ old+, but junc/avg does both because it assigns similarly low values to both new and old+, which both have relatively low Ψ .

the success of both consnet and the junc/avg model, compared to previous models of alternative splicing, is primarily attributable to the use of junction conservation. previous models assumed that only the conservation of intronic cis elements was important, but our results show that conservation of the splice junction, which is related to the evolutionary age of the exon, is also extremely predictive of splicing.

conserved cis elements are associated with reduced Ψ across multiple evolutionary timescales
the inverse correlation between conserved cis elements and Ψ is not limited to conservation across mammalian species. within each of the regimes new, old– and old+ – which, recall, refer to mammalian conservation – we compared the Ψ values of exons with high versus low average primate conservation over  <dig> bp of flanking introns . among old– exons, exons with high average primate conservation – which recently developed conserved cis elements – have lower Ψ than exons which never developed many conserved cis elements. conversely, among old+ exons, exons with low average primate conservation – which recently lost conserved cis elements – have higher Ψ than exons that retained them.

mean and standard error of Ψ for events in each regime, broken down further by whether the average primate conservation over  <dig> bp of the upstream flanking intron is high  or low . events in old- have higher Ψ than those in old+; within each of these regimes, events with low average primate conservation also have higher Ψ





this indicates that an increase in the conservation of cis elements over both the evolutionary timescale of primates  and mammals  is associated with a reduction in Ψ. however, these two timescales are not equally important: exons with many conserved cis elements in mammals but not in primates  still have lower Ψ than those with many conserved cis elements in primates but not in mammals . this indicates that mammalian conservation of cis elements has a more pronounced relationship with Ψ than primate conservation, and that exons with intronic cis elements that diverged farther in the past have greater differences in splicing patterns.

conserved flanking introns are associated with increased tissue-specific splicing, particularly in the brain
echoing the relationship demonstrated by  <cit>  between intronic conservation and tissue-specific splicing , table  <dig> shows that the proportions of low, medium and high Ψ exons have much more inter-tissue variance in old+ than in old–. this suggests that conserved flanking introns cause tissue differences in splicing patterns. there is a particularly large difference in splicing between brain tissue and other tissues in old+ that barely appears in the other regimes, indicating that the cassette exons responsible for giving the brain its unique phenotypic qualities lie disproportionately in old+.

however, tissue-specific regulation is not the primary reason why old+ is evenly split between high and low Ψ. among exons in old+ with high-confidence measurements in at least half of tissues,  <dig> % upstream and  <dig> % downstream are either high- Ψ or low- Ψ in every tissue. in other words, only about a quarter of old+ exons display any substantial tissue-specific regulation.

a new definition of intronic splicing regulatory elements
we next studied the relationship of k-mer counts to intronic conservation and splicing. we restricted our analysis to between  <dig> and  <dig> bp into the intron from the splice site , since regions beyond  <dig> bp are less important for splicing regulation, and using the first  <dig> bp adjacent to the splice site would confound our analysis with splicing consensus sequences.

yeo et al.  <cit>  defined intronic splicing regulatory elements  as k-mers that are significantly more conserved than the background in the nearest  <dig> bp to the splice site of both upstream and downstream flanking introns. voelker and berglund  <cit>  also used conserved regions as a basis for finding novel isres. however, conservation alone is not enough to predict whether a k-mer is associated with increased or decreased splicing, i.e. whether it is an intronic splicing enhancer  or an intronic splicing silencer .

an intuitive definition of an ise  is a k-mer with the property that events containing the k-mer have a higher  Ψ than events that do not. however, this definition does not account for differences in mono- and dinucleotide frequencies between high- and low- Ψ events, and would for instance result in gc-rich k-mers being labelled as ises and at-rich k-mers as isss because gc-rich introns are associated with increased splicing. to control for this, we trained a linear regression model to predict tissue-averaged Ψ from mono- and di-nucleotide frequencies and considered the residuals of this model – the difference between the true and predicted Ψ values for each event, which are assumed to be the component of Ψ not attributable to mono- and di-nucleotide frequencies – which we call residual
Ψ. we define a k-mer as an ise if residual Ψ is significantly higher in events containing the k-mer than in events not containing the k-mer at fdr  <cit>  q<  <dig> , and as an iss if residual Ψ is significantly lower, according to a mann-whitney test. under this definition, there are  <dig> upstream/ <dig> downstream ise 6-mers and  <dig> upstream/ <dig> downstream iss 6-mers, or  <dig> isre-region pairs in total .

to validate this definition, we trained a neural network to predict absolute Ψ using only isre counts in the upstream and downstream 15– <dig> bp regions, and achieved an auc of  <dig>  ±  <dig> , increasing to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  when two additional features were included to account for nonsense-mediated decay , translatable.c1c <dig> and translatable.c1ac <dig> .   <cit> ’s  <dig> upstream and  <dig> downstream 6-mers were less useful at predicting Ψ, performing no better than the same number of random 6-mers , despite containing over  <dig> times as many 6-mers as our list.
aucs for absolute Ψ prediction using k-mer counts, counts plus two nonsense-mediated decay  features from  <cit> , and conservation-weighted counts for various k-mer sets. the conservation weight of each k-mer instance is the minimum conservation over its k bases, to avoid counting non-functional k-mer instances that partially overlap functional ones. our isres predict Ψ more accurately than  <cit> ’s, which perform no better than the same number of random k-mers




interestingly, there is little overlap between our and  <cit> ’s isres: upstream, only  <dig> of our isres  overlap  <cit> ’s ,  <dig>  % of our isres’ instances and  <dig>  % of our isres’ total basewise conservation; downstream, only  <dig> of our isres  overlap ,  <dig>  % of their instances and  <dig>  % of their conservation overlap. one hypothesis for the lack of overlap is that the two definitions may capture different types of isres: perhaps our isres are moderately functional in a wide variety of locations, while  <cit> ’s are highly functional but only in conserved locations, i.e. in specific genetic contexts. however, using conservation-weighted k-mer counts instead of raw counts,  <cit> ’s isres are still less predictive than ours , which seems to contradict this hypothesis.

there is also little overlap between our isres and known rbp binding sites. we catalogued  <dig> 6-mers which contain the nova binding site ycay  <cit>  or are subsequences of 7-mers found by  <cit>  to have a high affinity  for at least one of  <dig> rbps. we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> upstream isres and  <dig> of the  <dig> downstream isres matched one of these  <dig> 6-mers, compared to the  <dig> * 793/ <dig> =  <dig>  upstream and  <dig> * 793/ <dig> =  <dig>  downstream isres that would be expected to match if the two sets were selected randomly. additional file 1: section  <dig> and additional file  <dig> list the rbps which had high affinity for each of the matching 6-mers.

common k-mers are more conserved in flanking introns
for each k-mer and region , we define three properties. first, a k-mer’s intronic conservation enrichment is the average conservation of all bases in the 15– <dig> bp region that are part of an instance of the k-mer, divided by the average conservation of the 15– <dig> bp region across all events. conservation enrichment can be defined per event or globally across all events. if a k-mer has a conservation enrichment greater than  <dig>  it is more conserved than a typical k-mer within 15– <dig> bp of the splice site.

second, a k-mer’s enrichment bias is the spearman correlation of its per-event conservation enrichment with residual Ψ across all events where the k-mer appears at least once. positive values indicate conservation enrichment near high- Ψ exons and negative values indicate enrichment near low- Ψ exons.

third, a k-mer’s ise/iss character is the spearman correlation of its count in the 15– <dig> bp region with residual Ψ across events . k-mers with more positive  spearman correlations with residual Ψ are more likely to be ises .
fig.  <dig> 6-mer count versus conservation enrichment. total count of each 6-mer versus conservation enrichment in upstream flanking introns . the high variation among k-mer counts  indicates substantial selection pressure on flanking introns. more common 6-mers tend to be more conserved . the most severely under-conserved k-mers  are also extremely rare, appearing in a tight band along the lower left edge of the plot




isss are more conserved near low Ψ exons; ises are more conserved near high Ψ exonsfig.  <dig> a ‘meta-correlation’ plot for 6-mers. the x coordinate of each 6-mer is the correlation across events where the k-mer appears of its count in the upstream 15– <dig> bp region  with tissue-averaged Ψ , and the y coordinate gives the correlation of its conservation enrichment with Ψ . these two properties have a spearman correlation of  <dig>   across all 6-mers. 6-mers appearing in fewer than  <dig> events or never appearing more than once in any event are not shown




this further supports the view that k-mers have some degree of ‘inherent’ regulatory activity, in addition to activity that depends on location and context. similar k-mers tend to become conserved in the introns flanking exons with similar Ψ, even though the k-mer occurs in different genetic contexts in each intron. if it is evolutionarily advantageous for an exon to have high Ψ, then ises will be under selection and eventually become conserved, and vice versa.

Ψ appears to explain differences in iss and ise conservation patterns
in the analysis of the previous section, one might wonder whether Ψ was just an extraneous variable: perhaps ise/iss character and conservation bias are only correlated because k-mer count and conservation enrichment are themselves correlated. to rule out this possibility, we generated  <dig> random permutations of Ψ values for each exon, then recalculated the two properties and their spearman correlation. upstream, the correlation was only larger in magnitude than  <dig>  for  <dig> of these  <dig> trials ; downstream, the correlation was larger than  <dig>  for  <dig> of  <dig> trials . though sub-significant, these results suggest that Ψ explains differences in iss and ise conservation patterns and that conserved intronic elements near splice sites are conserved because they regulate splicing.

isss are more conserved than ises in new exons
we then compared the overall conservation of ises versus isss for various regimes, using a mann-whitney test to compare the distribution of conservation scores for every base in every ise with the comparable distribution for isss . overall, upstream ises are more conserved than isss and downstream isss are more conserved than ises. despite this difference, isss are more conserved near new exons both upstream and downstream, suggesting that intronic regulatory elements are at least partially responsible for the low percent inclusion of this set of exons.

CONCLUSIONS
there are several pathways by which alternative splicing can evolve  <cit> : exonization from non-coding regions, transition from constutitive splicing, and exon shuffling. lev-maor et al.  <cit>  argued that the evolutionary transition from constitutive to alternative splicing is triggered by a weakening of the 5’ splicing consensus sequence. our results suggest an additional mechanism for this transition: the emergence of conserved isss. originally, old constitutive exons would be situated in old-, with high Ψ and few conserved cis elements; if at some time it became beneficial for the exon to be alternatively spliced or have tissue-specific splicing patterns, conserved isss would eventually emerge and the exon would migrate to old+.

we have identified 6-mer isres that are associated with Ψ in the upstream and downstream introns flanking alternatively spliced exons, listed in the additional files. the relatively high predictive power of these isres suggests the existence of novel rna-binding proteins and/or novel splicing roles for known rna-binding proteins. alternatively, some isres could influence splicing via rna secondary structure or effects on transcription rate. these isres are promising candidates for future experimental study.
