BACKGROUND
nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins synthesized in the cytosol are targeted to the mitochondria by one of two types of targeting signals, a hydrophobic presequence  and/or a cryptic internal sequence  <cit> . the mls directs the precursor protein to the translocase of the outer membrane  where translocation begins. in addition, the mls affects the precursor import efficiency as determined by the length of signal peptide  <cit>  and encodes the submitochondrial localization of mitochondrial proteins after mitochondrial processing, as exemplified by the presence of a cleavable or non-cleavable stop-transfer signal  <cit> . redistribution after mitochondrial processing can also be affected by protein folding, even though most precursor translocation requires unfolding. of the two reported examples of protein folding affecting mitochondrial import, the propeller domain of pp2a/bβ <dig> subunit arrests the import process and becomes on omm protein  <cit>  whereas rapid folding of yeast fumarase during the import favors the retrograde movement for a cytosolic localization  <cit> . interestingly, there are only a handful of proteins that distribute between the mitochondria and cytosol in a constitutive manner, fumarase being the most studied example. it has been demonstrated that fumarase has a 30%/70% mitochondria/cytosol isoprotein distribution and this dual localization occurs after mitochondrial processing  <cit> .

the pink <dig> gene encodes a kinase protein that contains an n-terminal mls and mutations in pink <dig> are linked to a recessive form of parkinson's disease. using a heterologous expression system, varying lengths of pink <dig> mls were tested  and all pink <dig> mls-gfp fusion proteins co-localized with mitochondrial markers, such as mitotracker or tom <dig> fluorescence  <cit> . these studies proved that pink <dig> mls is sufficient for mitochondrial targeting. the submitochondrial localization of pink <dig>  by biochemical fractionation, shows that all forms of pink <dig> are found at the outer membrane, intermembrane space, and inner membrane, but not the matrix  <cit> . however, the subcellular localization of endogenous and overexpressed pink <dig> in cell culture models show that pink <dig> does not solely localize to the mitochondrial fraction, as cytosolic and microsomal fractions are found to contain all cleaved forms of pink <dig>  <cit> . overexpression of cytosolic pink <dig>  one that lacks the mls, exhibits protective function against mptp toxicity in mice and in cell culture  <cit> . also, proteins found to associate with pink <dig> are either cytosolic  or cytosolically exposed . only htra <dig> and trap <dig> are found to associate with pink <dig> in the mitochondria  <cit> . currently no studies have examined the function of the mitochondrial form of pink <dig> in the absence of the cytosolic pink <dig> 

several important questions arise from pink <dig> dual localization: what purpose does the pink <dig> mls serve if a functional pink <dig> protein is also found in the cytosol? how does pink <dig> redistribute after mitochondrial processing? is the function of pink <dig> different in mitochondria as compared to the cytosol? we are very interested to understand the mechanism behind pink <dig> dual distribution, especially given the evidence that the mitochondrial pool of pink <dig> is tethered to the omm  and removal of the pink <dig> transmembrane domain mislocalizes pink <dig> inside the mitochondria  <cit> . we previously showed that pink <dig> cleaved forms are generated from the mitochondrial processing of pink <dig> precursor, thus suggesting that pink <dig> cytosolic redistribution occurs after cleavage  <cit> . we hypothesize that while the pink <dig> mls can direct proteins to the mitochondria, the required interaction between the pink <dig> kinase domain and hsp <dig> chaperone favors a retrograde movement, thus resulting in a cytosolic localization. to test our hypothesis, we fused wildtype pink <dig> as well as pink <dig> mutant that lacks hsp <dig> chaperone interaction with other known mls and examined the cytosolic and mitochondrial distribution of these proteins when expressed in a cell culture model.

RESULTS
pink <dig> n-terminal cleavages occur before and after pink <dig> transmembrane domain
at first glance, pink <dig> mls is similar either to those of inner membrane  or intermembrane space proteins . the difference between these two signals is the cleavage site after the transmembrane domain, which would determine whether or not the protein is anchored. overexpression of wt pink <dig> in cell lines leads to the generation of three or more pink <dig> forms, suggesting the presence of multiple cleavage sites  <cit> . the pattern of endogenous pink <dig> protein is debatable due to low endogenous pink <dig> expression and the lack of a high affinity antibody although it is generally accepted and agreed upon that at least two endogenous pink <dig> bands are detectable-the full length and a cleaved form around  <dig> kda  <cit> . a most recent paper showed three endogenous bands  <cit> . we and others have previously demonstrated that endogenous pink <dig> behaves similarly to the overexpressed pink <dig> counterparts in that pink <dig> fl accumulates under valinomycin treatment and pink <dig> Δ <dig> and Δ <dig> accumulate under proteasome inhibitor treatment  <cit> . using these two chemical inhibitors, we first wanted to establish that hela cells express three forms of endogenous pink <dig>  we observed that valinomycin treatment led to the increase of pink <dig> fl, and epoxomicin treatment increased two lower protein bands when compared to untreated cells . with epoxomicin, the heavily accumulated protein is pink <dig> Δ <dig> and the protein around  <dig> kda is the pink <dig> Δ <dig> form. we also tested the specificity of these three pink <dig> bands by using sirna to knockdown endogenous pink <dig>  in two independent sipink <dig> transfections, western blot showed all three endogenous pink <dig> proteins were decreased , confirming the hypothesis that endogenous pink <dig> also expresses two cleaved forms. in addition, we do not believe that the pink <dig> Δ <dig> form is a mere degradation product because our previous metabolic labeling data showed that pink <dig> Δ <dig> form is most stable protein of all pink <dig> forms  <cit> .

potential mitochondrial processing motifs have been examined for pink <dig> mls, where one predicted site is mapped at amino acid  <dig> and the second site around amino acids  <dig>  <cit> . both predicted cleavage sites correspond with the consensus r- <dig> or r- <dig> matrix processing motif  <cit> . the second processing consensus motif is upstream of the pink <dig> transmembrane domain  and proteolysis at this site can generate a protein with similar molecular weight to pink <dig> Δ <dig> form. we were first interested in determining the approximate molecular sizes of each pink <dig> cleaved products, which might yield clues about possible proteolytic sites. we constructed and expressed n-terminal serial truncation mutants, Δ <dig> pink <dig>  Δ <dig> pink <dig>  Δ <dig> pink <dig>  and Δ <dig> pink <dig>  by western blot, Δ <dig> and Δ <dig> pink <dig> showed proteins expressed as similar molecular weight as wt pink <dig> Δ <dig> and Δ <dig> cleaved products . we also observed that Δ <dig> pink <dig> was only expressed as a single form, corresponding to the smallest band in all of the pink <dig> constructs . data from these truncation mutants suggests that possible cleavage sites are within aa70- <dig> and aa105- <dig>  this is similar to a recent publication using serial n-terminal deletion pink <dig> constructs which suggested that the first cleavage site resides between aa91- <dig>  <cit> , placing the putative cleavage site within the transmembrane domain. since the disruption of n-terminal sequences may have affected mitochondrial targeting and cleavage, we also studied internal deletion mutants to map out the proteolytic sites in the pink <dig> mls . by targeting the predicted cleavage sites in the pink <dig> n-terminus, we truncated from aa25- <dig>  aa66- <dig>  aa66- <dig>  aa90- <dig>  and aa130- <dig>  unfortunately none of the internal deletions were able to abolish pink <dig> cleavage , illustrating the complexity of pink <dig> mls proteolysis. we did find that Δ25- <dig> pink <dig> was consistent with Δ <dig> pink <dig> in ruling out the cleavage site predicted at position  <dig>  based on n-terminal deletion mutants we predicted that a second cleavage site resides downstream of the transmembrane domain.

pink <dig> transmembrane and kinase domain determine pink <dig> subcellular distribution
as demonstrated before, wt pink <dig> overexpression showed dual subcellular distribution with all three forms found in both mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions . we asked how elements in the pink <dig> structure can contribute to the mechanism behind pink <dig> dual distribution. pink <dig> protein contains three easily identifiable elements, an n-terminal mls, a tm, and a c-terminal kinase domain. in general, the presence of a transmembrane domain in the mls serves as a stop-transfer, or sorting signal, that prevents mitochondrial proteins from matrix import. we tested three most feasable hypotheses: 1) pink <dig> tm serves as a stop-transfer signal, given that pink <dig> is not found in the matrix and pink <dig> mislocalized to the matrix compartment when the tm was deleted  <cit> , 2) the cleavage after the transmembrane domain allows mitochondrial pool of pink <dig> to become soluble, thus making it possible to redistribute to the cytosol, 3) the kinase domain interaction with hsp <dig> in the cytosol prevents pink <dig> from complete mitochondrial import, thus pink <dig> adopts a topology where the kinase domain is exposed to the cytosolic face on the omm.

we first tested the involvement of the tm in topology and dual distribution by using pink <dig> mls-gfp, where the pink <dig> tm is intact but the c-terminal kinase domain is now replaced with gfp. we found that pink <dig> mls-gfp distributed only to the mitochondria and not the cytosol . this gfp fusion protein was protected from proteinase k digest, suggesting that it is likely localized inside the outer membrane . as a control, we examined the mito-gfp protein by fractionation, using the cytochrome b <dig> mls . mito-gfp also resisted proteinase k digest and was not found in the cytosol . combined, the data suggests the tm alone is not enough to lead to pink <dig> topology with c-terminal portion of the protein facing the cytosol or cytosolic redistribution.

next we examined our earlier hypothesis that the cleavage after the transmembrane domain allows tethered mitochondrial pink <dig> to become cytosolic. because we are unable to abolish the second pink <dig> cleavage with our internal deletion mutants, we constructed and expressed immt-Δ <dig> pink <dig> fusion protein, one that contains the mitofilin mls and the pink <dig> kinase domain . mitofilin is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein whose mls includes a classical presequence followed by a tm, but not a proteolytic site downstream of the tm  <cit> . we found immt-Δ <dig> pink <dig> protein localized solely to the mitochondria and its sensitivity to proteinase k suggests an outer membrane topology . we reasoned that the lack of proteolysis after the tm prevents the release of immt-Δ <dig> pink <dig> from the mitochondria and it is very likely that immt-Δ <dig> pink <dig> is tethered to the outer membrane, similar to wt pink <dig>  the immt-Δ <dig> pink <dig> construct represents the first successful demonstration that we are able to eliminate the cytosolic pool of pink <dig> while retain proper pink <dig> mitochondrial topology.

we then asked whether the pink <dig> kinase domain itself can confer tethered topology and cytosolic distribution. this time we deleted pink <dig> mls and fused cytochrome b <dig> mls to the kinase domain. when we expressed mito-Δ <dig> pink <dig>  which now lacks a tm but retains the c-terminal kinase domain, we found this protein distributed equally to the cytosol and the mitochondria. the mitochondrial fraction of mito-Δ <dig> pink <dig> was protected from proteinase k digest, similar to matrix chaperone hsp <dig> . we also examined the subcellular distribution of Δ90- <dig> pink <dig>  where the pink <dig> tm is deleted. we found that Δ90- <dig> pink <dig> predominantly localized to the mitochondrial fraction that is insensitive to proteinase treatment and a small fraction of cleaved Δ90- <dig> pink <dig> was found in the cytosolic fraction . thus in the absence of a transmembrane domain, pink <dig> has altered submitochondrial localization but some cytosolic redistribution remains. taken all together, our data suggests that 1) the tm and the kinase domain are both needed for a tethered, cytosolic-facing, kinase domain topology and 2) pink <dig> cytosolic redistribution requires both proteolysis after the tm and the kinase domain.

it was previously shown that pink <dig> lacking mls is mostly cytosolic although it can still interact with omm or ims proteins  <cit> . when we expressed Δ <dig> pink <dig>  lacking the n-terminal mls, we found that this protein localized mostly to the cytosol, but some was still found in the mitochondrial fraction and co-localized with mitochondrial markers . it is likely that Δ <dig> pink <dig> contains additional internal cryptic targeting signal because mitochondrially-localized Δ <dig> pink <dig> was protected from proteinase k digest. finally, we asked whether or not pink <dig> dual distribution is evolutionarily conserved by examining the subcellular localization of drosophila pink <dig>  we found drosophila pink <dig> in both cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions with two cleavage sites similar to the mammalian form .

to further examine the idea that pink <dig> kinase domain-hsp <dig> interaction modulates mitochondrial entry of pink <dig>  we hypothesized that destabilizing the pink1-hsp <dig> interaction will increase pink <dig> import into the mitochondria. we wanted to test the idea that the hsp <dig> interaction is preventing pink <dig> forward movement during mitochondrial import. we chose to use the pink <dig> l347p mutation, a naturally occurring pd mutation with reduced hsp <dig> interaction  <cit> . first we compared the subcellular localization between pink <dig> wt and pink <dig> l347p and found there was not observable difference in the cytosolic or mitochondrial distribution between the two proteins . even with a loss of hsp <dig> binding, we reasoned that the intact transmembrane domain was enough to prevent pink <dig> l347p from completely entering the mitochondria. therefore, we constructed and expressed mito-Δ <dig> pink <dig> where we exchanged the pink <dig> mls with that of cytochrome b <dig>  to isolate the effect of tm out of the equation and to focus on hsp <dig> interaction . we compared the subcellular distribution of mito-Δ <dig> pink <dig> in the absence and presence of hsp <dig> inhibitor, 17-aag . we observed that in the presence of 17-aag, mito-Δ <dig> pink <dig> loses its cytosolic distribution with slight reduction in mitochondrial pink <dig>  we also noticed that the pink <dig> protein sizes are slightly different between cytosol and mitochondria, although we are unsure of the explanation behind this size shift. it has been reported that matrix-localized pink <dig> appears as a doublet either through post-translational modification or this size difference may arise from pink <dig> having entered the mitochondria to have its mls cleaved off by mitochondrial matrix protease  <cit> . in addition to the hsp <dig> inhibitor experiment, we constructed mito-l347p pink <dig> and compared its subcellular distribution to mito-Δ <dig> pink <dig>  when we compared the cytosol/mitochondria distribution between mito-Δ <dig> pink <dig> and mito-l347p pink <dig>  there was significantly more  mito-l347p pink <dig>  than mito-Δ <dig> pink <dig>  in the mitochondria . lastly, we confirmed the hsp <dig> interaction by co-immunoprecipitation and found a reduction in hsp <dig> binding with mito-l347p pink <dig> compared to Δ <dig> or mito-Δ <dig> pink <dig> . full length l347p pink <dig> also interacted less with hsp <dig> compared to wt pink <dig>  and none of the gfp fusion proteins associated with hsp <dig> . these data suggest that the hsp <dig> chaperone interaction on the cytosolic side can prevent pink <dig> from further mitochondrial entry, consequentially leading to the release of pink <dig> from the mitochondria once proteolysis removes pink <dig> from the transmembrane anchor.

discussion
as mentioned in the introduction, both cytosolic and mitochondrial functions of pink <dig> have been suggested. elucidating the exact pink <dig> subcellular localization will help us to understand these reported functions. the distribution of pink <dig> in cells suggests that while a small percentage of pink <dig> can be fully imported or associated with the mitochondria, the majority of pink <dig> is believed to reside in the cytosol. the demonstration that pink <dig> contains a functional mls and localizes within the mitochondria supports the hypothesis that pink <dig> has a functional role in the mitochondria. while this functional role is unclear, several studies suggest a role of pink <dig> in the mitochondrial fission/fusion pathway  <cit>  and in mitophagy of damaged mitochondria  <cit> . other compelling scientific data supports the hypothesis that pink <dig> is also a cytosolic kinase. strong evidence of a cytosolic degradation, cytosolic binding partners, and a protective function in the cytosol all point to a kinase protein with a dual localization and possibly two different functions, depending on the subcellular compartment. a major limitation in understanding the subcellular localization of pink <dig> is the fact that many studies on pink <dig> rely on pink <dig> overexpression. two challenges force researchers to utilize a heterologous overexpression system: the lack of a specific multi-purpose antibody against pink <dig>  and the fact that the endogenous pink <dig> expression level is very low. as we have demonstrated previously  <cit> , properties of exogenous pink <dig> are reflected by the endogenous pink <dig>  justifying that overexpressed pink <dig> serves as a good model for the endogenous protein.

unlike other mitochondrial proteins that localize exclusively to the mitochondria, mitochondrial proteins that adopt a cytosolic localization do so in a stimulus-induced fashion. with the exception of yeast fumarase and human pink <dig>  no other single gene-encoded, mls-containing protein constitutively localizes to both the mitochondria and the cytosol, with the majority of the isoprotein residing in the cytosol.  in this paper, we investigated the important factors for pink <dig> topology and dual localization and found three necessary components in the pink <dig> protein-the transmembrane domain, the cleavage site after the tm, and the hsp <dig> interaction . we confirmed that the pink <dig> mls is responsible for mitochondrial localization and that two cleavage sites in the pink <dig> mls are responsible for generating pink <dig> Δ <dig> and Δ <dig>  present in both endogenous and exogenous pink <dig>  we attempted to map out the proteolytic sites by deleting the protein sequence encompassing the predicted cleavage sites. however, pink <dig> continued to be cleaved into two products from the precursor. this could mean that we did not target the correct cleavage sites even though they are predicted by mitoport or other prediction programs. pink <dig> presequence cleavage might not follow the classical r-2/r-3/r- <dig> motif, where there are numerous examples  <cit> . alternatively, it is thought that cleavage specificity of mitochondrial peptidases is less dependent on the primary protein sequence and more on the structural elements present in both the presequence as well as the mature protein  <cit> . thus mutational or deletion studies  will have variable results, including a lack of obvious effect on presequence cleavage. what is clear from our internal deletion study is that a second cleavage site is present after the transmembrane domain and this site plays an important role in pink <dig> subcellular redistribution. removal of this second cleavage site completely abolished cytosolic distribution of pink <dig>  as we showed with a noncleavable tm in mitofilin mls. because we are unable to abolish the cleavage of pink <dig> mls, we took advantage of the similarity between pink <dig> mls and mitofilin mls to determine how presequence cleavage plays a role in pink <dig> topology and distribution. even though immt-Δ <dig> pink <dig> was not found in cytosol, it was digested by proteinase k, similar to wt pink <dig>  suggesting that it is tethered to the outer surface of the mitochondria. we predict that if we substitute the pink <dig> mls with a bipartite presequence of an intermembrane space protein  then pink <dig> would become soluble and redistribute to the cytosol.

when we addressed the role of the transmembrane domain, we confirmed the previous hypothesis that the transmembrane domain, acting as a stop-transfer signal, prevents forward import of pink <dig> into the matrix. we demonstrated that in the absence of a transmembrane domain, either by deleting the pink <dig> tm or by substituting pink <dig> mls with a matrix targeting signal, we were able to redirect mitochondrial pink <dig> into proteinase-insensitive fraction. thus the transmembrane domain is important, although not sufficient, for membrane tethering and cytosolic-facing topology.

we found that the pink <dig> kinase domain, in conjunction with presequence cleavage, contributes to cytosolic redistribution of pink <dig>  mitochondrial-targeted gfp  were not found in the cytosol nor was gfp co-immunoprecipitated with hsp <dig>  when pink <dig> kinase domain was present and co-immunoprecipitated with hsp <dig>  these recombinant proteins all showed dual subcellular distribution, except for immt-Δ <dig> pink <dig> . when we introduced natural pink <dig> mutation l347p in the kinase domain, we not only disrupted the hsp90-pink <dig> interaction, we increased the mitochondrial pink <dig> level, provided that a tm is absent. more pink <dig> l347p mutant protein was found in the mitochondrial fraction compared to its wildtype counterpart. to explain why l347p pink <dig> and mito-l347p pink <dig> are found in the cytosol, we believe that a complete loss of hsp <dig> interaction is necessary, as demonstrated by gfp proteins. in our co-immunoprecipitation experiment, l347p pink <dig> and mito-l347p pink <dig> showed significant reduction but not a 100% loss of hsp <dig> interaction. this residual hsp <dig> binding may account for the cytosolic redistribution. of course, to completely eliminate pink1-hsp <dig> interaction will render pink <dig> unstable and destine for rapid proteasome degradation. importantly, we want to point out that decreased pink <dig> retention in the cytosol consists of both accelerated degradation and increased pink <dig> mitochondrial entry. when hsp <dig> inhibitor, 17-aag, was used in the experiment for figure 4b, we did not see an increase in total mitochondrial pink <dig> comparing untreated to 17-aag-we actually saw a loss of signal. this is probably due to accelerated degradation and the loss of total pink <dig>  thus we chose to complement the inhibitor data with the l347p mutation experiment-to avoid accelerating pink <dig> degradation and other non-specific effects from 17-aag, thereby to focus on how l347p mutation influences subcellular distribution. in that setting, mitochondrial pink <dig> increased. together, we believe that once pink <dig> enters the mitochondria, pink <dig> adopts a tethered topology because both the transmembrane domain and the kinase domain prevent pink <dig> forward movement into the mitochondria. subsequent proteolysis downstream of the transmembrane domain then releases pink <dig> for retrograde movement while pink <dig> kinase interacts with the hsp <dig> chaperone.

as demonstrated by zhou et al , we find that pink <dig> tm is required for kinase domain facing the cytosol. in addition, pink <dig> kinase domain facing the cytosol also requires hsp <dig> interaction and we believe it is the combined effects of tm and chaperone interaction that give mitochondrial pink <dig> its proper topology. we have demonstrated that pink <dig> Δ <dig> lacks the tm domain and thus its association with mitochondria must be through another mechanism. the question turns to whether or not pink <dig> Δ <dig> is tethered to the mitochondrial membrane? we already know that this pink <dig> cleaved form is rapidly degraded by the proteasome. given the evidence that the first cleavage site might reside within the tm region, this suggests that pink <dig> Δ <dig> might be loosely anchored or not anchored at all in its transient half-life.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the interaction of the kinase domain with hsp <dig> plays a significant role in pink <dig> topology and cytosolic redistribution. it is conceivable that hsp <dig> binding to the pink <dig> kinase domain is preventing the vectorial movement of pink <dig> precursor protein during the entire import process. while pink <dig> is targeted to the mitochondria, pink <dig> function in the mitochondria is unclear. published results show that loss of pink <dig> can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, but it is not clear that this is the result of losing mitochondrial pink <dig> or cytosolic pink <dig>  echoing a concern previously raised by beilina et al , the possibility that the cytosol contains mature pink <dig> kinase challenges researchers to delineate how exactly pink <dig> function links directly to mitochondrial functions. embedded in this dual subcellular localization model is the proposal that pink <dig> has compartment-specific functions, as was found for yeast fumarase. we believe that functional studies of pink <dig> need to implement the experimental design of examining pink <dig> function when it resides in only one subcellular compartment in order to tease apart pink <dig> functional roles.
