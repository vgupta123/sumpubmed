BACKGROUND
during development of the central nervous system , all types of neuronal and macroglial cells derive from neuroepithelial neural stem cells   <cit> . nscs self-renew and continue to function as source of new cells in adults  <cit> . the fate determination of neural stem cells is regulated by cell-intrinsic programs as well as extrinsic cues from the surrounding environment  <cit> . in the adult, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the production of new neurons in the dentate gyrus or in the subventricular zone are still unknown, although extrinsic factors expressed for example by astrocytes could play a role  <cit> .

bmps  are secreted members of the tgf-β superfamily. together with their receptors, they are abundantly expressed in the brain both during embryogenesis and in the adult  <cit> . more specifically, an expression of bmp <dig> was demonstrated in different cell types like ectodermal cells  <cit> , radial glia  <cit> , haematopoietic cells  <cit> , chondrocytes  <cit>  and stromal cells  <cit> . as for other members of the tgf-β superfamily, bmps signal transduction is triggered by binding to type  <dig> and type  <dig> serine-threonine kinase receptors, inducing their dimerization. in this manner, bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> signalling specifically leads to the formation of bmpr-1a/bmpr-ii and bmpr-1b/bmpr-ii heterodimers  <cit> . bmps have been shown to play a role in patterning and cellular fate determination in many tissues  <cit> . for examples, during development, bmps are involved in the induction of the neuroectoderm, the patterning of the dorsal roof of neural tube, the development of neural crests and of the peripheral nervous system  <cit> . in postnatal animals, they promote the differentiation of neuronal precursors in the spinal cord  <cit>  and in the cortex  <cit> . finally, they facilitate an astroglial lineage commitment of forebrain subventricular zone progenitor cells  <cit> .

cellular therapies using stem cells are promising approaches for the treatment of several chronic or acute neurological diseases such as parkinson's  <cit>  or huntington's diseases  <cit>  or spinal cord injuries  <cit> . one main problem relates to the origin and the nature of the cells to be used for such procedures. foetal brain tissue has already been shown to have significant effects in patients with parkinson's disease. clinical use of the foetal brain tissue is, however, limited by ethical and technical problems as it requires high numbers of grafted foetal cells and a possible immunosuppression. alternatively, somatic stem cells derived from adult tissues seem to be better candidates for cell replacement therapy  <cit> . these observations raise hopes in cell replacement strategies based on an autograft approach. however, the exact mechanism by which mesenchymal stem cells  adopt a neural fate is not completely understood as recent in vivo studies demonstrated that mscs fuse with host neuronal cells  <cit> . these observations impose a better knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the phenotypic plasticity of somatic stem cells and the characterization of their daughter differentiated cells is a prerequisite before considering their use in the treatment of human patients.

recently, we demonstrated that two phenotypes of mscs could be obtained in culture: nestin-positive mscs  which are able to integrate some extrinsic signals when co-cultured with neurons leading to a differentiation into astrocyte-like cells and nestin-negative mscs  which are unable to adopt a neural phenotype but remain able to differentiate into adipocytes, chondrocytes or osteocytes  <cit> . when considering the use of mscs as a source of material for cell replacement protocols in neurological diseases, one has also to be concerned by a possible effect of these mscs on the host nervous tissue and more particularly on immature resident neural cells. in several models of neurological diseases, grafted mscs were shown to favour host cns regeneration rather than to express themselves a neural phenotype  <cit> . this positive effect of msc grafts could result from the release of factors acting on resident immature cells in the adult brain. recently, it has been demonstrated that following ischemia in the adult striatum, intra-ventricular egf injections are able to stimulate neurogenesis from resident neural stem cells, although egf is devoid of any effect in non-ischemic striatum  <cit> . these observations emphase the importance of the lesion priming in order to respond to extrinsic factors or cytokines. in this paper, we address the question of the influence of mscs on neural stem cells in vitro and demonstrate that mscs favour astroglial lineage. we observe that npmscs are able to stimulate astroglial fate in striatal progenitor cultures and to repress neuronal and oligodendroglial fate through the release of diffusible factor. using brdu incorporation, we demonstrate that this npmsc conditioned medium has no effect on the astrocytic or oligodendrocytic progenitor proliferation. propidium iodide incorporations suggest that the npmscs conditioned medium protect gfap-positive cells from cell death in comparison to the effect of nnmscs conditioned medium or to the control condition. meanwhile, no increase of cell death is observed in neuronal and oligodendroglial populations. we then demonstrated that bmp <dig> is present in a biologically-active form in the npmscs but not in nnmscs conditioned medium and is responsible for both the increase of astroglial numbers and the inhibition of oligodendrocyte differentiation in striatal nsc cultures.

RESULTS
nestin-positive mscs increase astrocytes number in differentiating neural stem cell cultures
neurosphere-derived cells from gfp-positive e <dig> green mouse striata include neural stem cells and progenitors which are still proliferating but already committed to a given cell fate. upon transfer on adherent surfaces , these cells spread and spontaneously differentiate as follows after  <dig> days of culture:  <dig>  ±  <dig> % gfap-positive cells ,  <dig> ±  <dig> % tuj1-positive cells  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % 04-positive cells . when co-cultivated with nestin-positive mscs , phenotypic allocation of neurosphere-derived cells  become strikingly different: gfap labelling is increased to  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  , while tuj- <dig> and o <dig> are decreased to respectively  <dig>  ±  <dig> %   and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  . on the other hand, if neurospheres are co-cultured with nestin-negative mscs , the percentage of labelled cells were  <dig>  ±  <dig> %,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for respectively gfap, tuj- <dig> and o <dig>  these numbers are not significantly different from the numbers obtained in control cultures for gfap- and o4-positive cells , while significantly lower for tuj-1-postive cells .

mscs effect on neurospheres-derived astrocytes number is due to a soluble factor
to further characterize the mechanism  responsible for such an increase in astrocytes number in presence of npmscs, we tried to induce the differentiation of neurospheres with npmsc conditioned medium. the following data were obtained:  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the neurosphere-derived cells became gfap-positive,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % were tuj1-positive and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % were 04-positive . conversely, in nnmscs conditioned medium, differentiated phenotypes were distributed as follows:  <dig> ±  <dig> %,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  and were similar to results obtained in corresponding co-cultures. moreover, we confirmed those results by absolute count: 1) in npmscs conditioned medium 392/ <dig> cells were gfap-positive, 9/ <dig> cells were o4-positive and 32/ <dig> cells were tuj1-positive ; 2) in nnmscs conditioned medium 251/ <dig> cells were gfap-positive, 29/ <dig> were o4-positive and 23/ <dig> were tuj1-positive; 3) in the control condition , 211/ <dig> cells were gfap-positive, 27/ <dig> cells were o4-positive and 167/ <dig> cells were tuj1-positive. hence, regarding the phenotypic allocation, no significant difference is observed between neurosphere differentiated in co-culture and in conditioned medium. . this clearly suggest that npmscs-derived soluble factor is  responsible for an increase in the astrocytes number and a decrease in the neurons and oligodendrocytes numbers.

nestin-positive msc conditioned medium act on the gfap-positve cell death
as mentioned above, neurosphere derived-cells include neural stem cells and progenitors which are still proliferating but already committed to a given cell fate. we characterised the proportion of each progenitor cell-type present in our neurospheres. after dissociation, cells were allowed to adhere for one hour in coated dish and then fixed, labelled and counted. in those conditions we observed  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of gfap-positive cells,  <dig> ±  <dig> % of tuj1-positive cells and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of o4-positive cells .

in order to define if npmscs conditioned medium has an instructive or/and a selective effect on neural cells, we analysed the proliferative capacity and the cell death in the differentiating neurospheres. the brdu incorporation in differentiating neurosphere-derived cells cultivated in npmscs- or in nnmscs-conditioned medium or in control  medium  did not show any significant differences . these data rule out a proliferative effect on already committed astrocyte progenitors or an inhibition of cell proliferation in oligodendroglial and neuronal progenitors. furthermore, using propidium iodide incorporations and counting, we quantified the cell death in gfap-, tuj1- and o4-positive cell population during the differentiation culture in the three conditioned media . after  <dig> hours, we observed a significant decrease of the number of gfap-positive cells which have incorporated the propidium iodide in npmscs-conditioned medium  in comparison to the two other culture condition. this result suggests that npmsc conditioned medium partially inhibit the cell death in the gfap-positive cell population. nevertheless, no significant increase of cell death is observed in o4- and tuj1-positive cell population . when propidum iodide incorporations are performed after four days of differentiation without renewing the conditioned media, no significant differences in the cell death could be observed in the three lineages, whatever the culture condition .

bmp <dig> is present in nestin-positive conditioned medium and is responsible for the increase of gfap-positive cells in differentiating nscs
previous reports have shown that several secreted growth factors, including bmp <dig>  bmp <dig>  lif and cntf stimulate the differentiation of cultured neural precursors into astrocytes  <cit> . the expression of those cytokines was compared in nnmscs and in npmscs using quantitative rt-pcr. compared to nnmscs, we found that npmscs slightly increased the expression level of bmp <dig> mrna  while the bmp <dig>  and lif  expression is slightly decreased . no significant difference was observed concerning the cntf mrna expression. western blotting analyses of npmscs, nnmscs and neurosphere-derived cells conditioned media showed that only npmscs release in their culture medium the mature and biologically-active form of bmp <dig> , although nnmscs and neurosphere-derived cells expressed the biologically-inactive precursor form of bmp <dig>  . finally, we observed that neurospheres-derived cells cultivated in npmscs conditioned medium supplemented with an anti-bmp <dig> blocking antibodies, differentiate into  <dig>  ±  <dig> % gfap-positive cells,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % tuj1-positive cells and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % o4-positive cells . statistical analyses did not show significant differences in gfap- or o4-positive cells compared to control culture conditions . however, the number of tuj1-positive cells remains significantly lower . we thus conclude that the major glial effects  of the npmscs on the neural progenitor differentiation is due to the release of biologically-active bmp <dig>  the inhibition of neuronal differentiation should be attributed to another yet uncharacterized soluble factor.

discussion
during the last few years, a number of studies have addressed the phenotypic plasticity of mscs. most of them were performed in vivo and demonstrated that environmental factors play important roles in determining the ability of grafted mscs to adopt a neural-like phenotype. grafting of a subset of mscs into the lateral ventricle of neonatal mice resulted in their migration within the forebrain and cerebellum, and their differentiation into astrocytes  <cit> . when mscs were grafted into adult rat cerebellum after an ischemic lesion, they differentiated into cells expressing neuronal markers  <cit> . nakano et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that murine bone marrow cells differentiated into three distinct glial phenotypes  when they were directly injected into the striatum of previously irradiated mice. similarly, systemic injection of mscs in lethally irradiated mice allowed their differentiation into neuronal and astroglial cells  <cit> . interestingly, the systemic injection of mscs in non-irradiated but brain-lesioned mice had positive effects on injury repair, but very few msc-derived cells expressed neural marker in such conditions  <cit> . given those results, somatic stem cells raise thus hopes in cell replacement strategies based on an autograft approach. recent in vivo studies  <cit>  demonstrated that mscs adopt neural fate by fusion with host neural cells. at least so far, there is no a clear and conclusive demonstration of a real differentiation of mscs in neural cells. however, all those data obtained in vivo suggested that somatic stem cells seem to be promising for cellular therapy in neural diseases whatever the mechanism responsible for. it remains that a better knowledge of the molecular and cellular mechanism underlying the neural phenotypic plasticity of mscs is required before considering those cells in human graft protocols.

as we mentioned above, environment is able to modify the cellular differentiation capacity. in this study, we addressed the question of a possible effect of mscs on neural progenitor cell fate and we choose an in vitro approach. co-culture experiments demonstrate that mscs display multiple activities in the regulation of embryonic striatum-derived progenitors and stem cells. their effect mainly depends of their age in vitro: npmscs  increase the astrocytes numbers while inhibiting neuronal and oligodendroglial numbers. conversely, nnmscs  only decrease the neuronal differentiation. since similar results were obtained using msc conditioned media, we concluded that these effects could be mediated by diffusible factor. we then analysed the effect of various conditioned media on the cell proliferation  as well as the cell death  in each neurosphere-derived cell types and at two different differentiation period . we only observed a significant decrease of propidium iodide incorporation in gfap-positive cell population at  <dig> hours of differentiation suggesting that soluble factor select astroglial lineage by protecting those cells from cell death.

the activity which drives neurosphere-derived cells into astrocytes only occurs in npmsc conditioned medium while the neuronal differentiation-inhibiting activity is present both in np- and nnmsc conditioned media. we tried to identify the astrogliogenetic factor by measuring the expression by nn- and npmscs of cytokines known to promote an astroglial fate  <cit> . our results show that only npmscs express mature and biologically-active bmp <dig> while a biologically-inactive bmp <dig> precursor form is expressed and released by nnmscs and neurosphere-derived cells in culture. indeed, bmp <dig> is synthesized and released as an inactive precursor before being proteolytically activated by cleavage at the amino acid motif -arg-ser-lys-arg-  <cit> . relatively little is known about the regulatory mechanisms controlling the susceptibility of individual tgf-β family members to proteolytic cleavage. however, recent studies suggest that members of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase  family, spc <dig> and spc <dig>  could enhance the cleavage of bmp <dig> precursor. the availability of biologically active bmps may therefore be controlled by the released of their precursor followed by the action of the proprotein convertases  <cit> .

the release by npmscs of biologically-active form of bmp <dig> which promotes astroglial differentiation and inhibits oligodendroglial differentiation is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that bmps play multiple roles in development  <cit> . other studies have reported that the effects of bmps are age- and tissue-dependent  <cit>  and that bmps promote astroglial differentiation and inhibit oligodendroglial differentiation when applied to cultures of cortical cells plated at e <dig>  <cit> . likewise, brief treatment with bmps induces astroglial fate in cultured neural precursors from embryonic mice  <cit>  or in oligodendrocytes from newborn rats  <cit> . more recently, rajan et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that bmp <dig> induces astroglial differentiation of e <dig> and adult cortical neural stem cells from the subventricular zone when they are placed in high density culture. in this case, bmp <dig> has a true instructive role as nscs cultures were clonal. beside the instructive effect of bmp <dig> on glial lineages, some studies explained how bmp <dig> could act on astrocytic and oligodendrocytic precursors. a study realised on cerebellar primitive neurectodermal tumor cell line demonstrated that a high concentration of bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> attenuate apoptosis  <cit> . bmp-mediated inhibition of oligodendrogenesis is controlled through the repression of the former transcription factor olig <dig> known to be essential for the oligodendrocytic development  <cit> . all of these data suggest that bmp <dig> released by npmscs selectively act on astrocytic and oligodendrocytic progenitors. in our experiments, we only demonstrate the anti-apoptotic effect of npmscs-conditioned medium but we didn't test its possible instructive effect in clonal cultures. as bmp <dig>  present in a biologically-active form in npmscs conditioned medium, has been identified to be responsible of the increase of astrocytes numbers by the immunoblocking experiment and as it has been already demonstrated to be instructive  <cit> , one could hypothesise that, in our system, the increase of astrocytes in response to npmscs-derived bmp <dig> is a consequence of both a anti-apoptotic effect on gfap-positive cells and also an instructive effect on nscs.

CONCLUSIONS
when considering the use of mscs in cell replacement strategies for the treatment of various neurological diseases, it should be taken into account that those cells could also influence the development host neural precursors.
