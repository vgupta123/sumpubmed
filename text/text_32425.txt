BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small regulatory molecules of between  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides. they play important roles in many biological processes, including development, differentiation and metabolism  <cit> . the mirna regulation of target genes occurs mostly at the 3′-untranslated region of mrnas. the transcriptional profiles of mouse 3t3-l <dig> cells  have been monitored during differentiation using microarrays and of the  <dig> differentially expressed sequence tags, 71% of the differentially expressed genes could be regulated by mirnas  <cit> . the process of mature mirna production contains three steps. first, mirna genes yield pri-mirnas via rna polymerase ii. second, the pri-mirnas are processed to generate pre-mirnas by a complex containing drosha. finally, mirna:mirna* duplexes are generated under the effect of dicer. the mirna:mirna* duplexes have two strands. one strand is more stable and is incorporated into an rna-induced silencing complex , while the other strand  is usually discarded  <cit> . however, guo et al. reported two different fates for the mirna* strand: it is either degraded as merely a carrier strand or it is expressed abundantly as a potential functional guide mirna  <cit> .

the involvement of mirnas with lipid metabolism was first reported in 2003; a lack of mir- <dig> can increase the accumulation of diacylglycerol and triglyceride in drosophila  <cit> . in vivo and in vitro data show that mirnas play an important role in lipogenesis  <cit> . for instance, the expression of mir- <dig> increased in differentiating adipocytes. also the inhibition of mir- <dig> can effectively suppress the differentiation of adipocytes. this indicated a potential role of mir- <dig> in adipocyte differentiation  <cit> . during differentiation of the mouse pre-adipocyte 3t3-l <dig> cell line, mir-17- <dig> was identified as a significantly up-regulated mirna cluster at the clonal expansion stage  <cit> . on the other hand, some mirnas were also reported as inhibitors of adipocyte differentiation, such as mir-27b and let- <dig>  <cit> .

it is well known that castration of male pigs can decrease an unpleasant odor in pork. however, it also results in unwanted fat deposition  <cit> . mangelsdorf et al.  <cit>  found that androgens influence gene transcription through the activation of the androgen receptor , a ligand-activated transcription factor that binds specific dna motifs in its target genes. ribas et al. showed that androgen-induced ar can bind to the defined mir- <dig> promoter, mippr- <dig>  which demonstrated that ar can directly regulate the transcription of mir- <dig> mrna  <cit> . we hypothesized that decreased levels of ar may directly regulate the transcription of certain mirnas after castration. these mirnas may contribute to the fat deposition phenotype. we therefore compared the expression of mirnas between castrated and intact male pigs from full-sib pairs, in order to identify novel fat-deposition-related and differentially expressed mirnas after castration. the purpose of this research is to gain new insight into fat deposition-related mirnas in pigs, which will improve our understanding of fat deposition after castration.

RESULTS
overview of the fat-deposition-related mirna transcription profile
a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads ranging in size from  <dig> nt- <dig> nt were retrieved from the f <dig> and f <dig> libraries, respectively. the size distribution of the clean reads is shown in figure  <dig>  interestingly the size distribution of the small rnas was similar between the small rna libraries of the castrated  and intact  male pigs. by aligning the clean reads against the pig genome sequences ,  <dig> , <dig> reads in the f <dig> library and  <dig> , <dig> reads in the f <dig> library were matched to the pig genome. a read was assigned to a mirna by blasting against the non-mirna databases. the clean reads were annotated into different categories. the number of 21– <dig> nt sequences  was significantly greater than that of shorter or longer sequences. almost half of the sequences in the f <dig> and f <dig> libraries were  <dig> nt, which is consistent with the known specificity of dicer processing and the features of mature mirnas .

identification of known and novel porcine mirnas and mirtrons
a total of  <dig> unique mirna genes comprising  <dig> known pre-mirnas and  <dig> novel pre-mirnas were identified. one hundred and sixty-seven pre-mirnas overlapped between the two libraries. one hundred and fifty-three and  <dig> known mirnas genes were identified in the f <dig> and f <dig> libraries , respectively, of which  <dig> and  <dig> were novel mirna*s . the novel mirna*s constituted  <dig> % of the total known expressed mirnas. from this data set,  <dig> novel mirnas and  <dig> novel mirna*s were identified in the f <dig> library, corresponding to  <dig> novel mirna genes. of those  <dig> candidate novel mirnas in the f <dig> library,  <dig> were conserved in other mammals and the other  <dig> were considered to be pig-specific . in the f <dig> library,  <dig> novel mirnas and  <dig> novel mirna*s were detected, corresponding to  <dig> novel mirna genes. of those  <dig> candidate novel mirnas in the f <dig> library,  <dig> were conserved and  <dig> were pig-specific . hairpin structures of the partial novel mirna precursors are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

f3: castrated male pig mirna library; f4: intact males pig mirna library; * <dig> pre-mirnas were common to both f <dig> and f <dig> 

the chromosome locations of known and candidate novel pre-mirnas were determined based on the pig draft genomic sequence  from ensembl . all of these mirnas were mapped on autosomes or the x chromosome . about  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the novel pre-mirnas in the f <dig> and f <dig> libraries, respectively, were located in intergenic regions. interestingly some pre-mirnas had multiple copies. nine pre-mirnas in the f <dig> library and  <dig> pre-mirnas in the f <dig> library were mapped to two positions on the same chromosome. in addition, ssc-mir-f4-s <dig> has three matched loci . the genomic density of pre-mirnas is shown in figure  <dig>  in the f <dig> library, the average density of pre-mirnas located on the auto-chromosome and x chromosome ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mirnas per  <dig> mbp. the shortest chromosome,  <dig>  and the longest chromosome,  <dig>  encoded  <dig> and  <dig> pre-mirnas, respectively, corresponding to  <dig>  and  <dig>  genomic densities. in the f <dig> library, the average density was from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the shortest and the longest chromosomes encoded nine and  <dig> pre-mirnas, respectively, corresponding to  <dig>  and  <dig>  genomic densities. based on the dataset,  <dig> and  <dig> pre-mirnas were found on the x chromosome in the f <dig> and f <dig> libraries, respectively, and the corresponding average genomic density was  <dig>  and  <dig> .

in this study, mirtrons were identified as special pre-mirnas, which constitute a recently described category of mirna that relies on splicing rather than processing by the microprocessor complex to generate the rnai pathway. mirtrons were originally recognized in the fly and worm, but they have also been reported in mammals  <cit> . from our dataset, five mirtrons  were identified. however, they were only found in the f <dig> library at low levels of expression . these mirtrons need to be further validated with rt-qpcr to confirm that they are not false-positives caused by specific expression from one single animal.

differentially expressed mirnas in backfat between castrated and intact male pigs
one hundred and seventy-seven mirnas, including  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated , were found to have more than 2-fold differential expression between the castrated and intact male pigs . in the f <dig> library, ssc-mir- <dig>  ssc-mir- <dig>  ssc-mir-199b, ssc-mir- <dig>  ssc-mir- <dig>  ssc-mir-10a, ssc-mir-320a, ssc-mir- <dig>  ssc-mir-23a and ssc-mir-23b were the dominant expressed mirnas, with the number of reads ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> , <dig>  the reads of dominant mirnas constituted  <dig> % of the total reads. in the f <dig> library, the  <dig> most abundant mirnas  had reads numbering from  <dig>  to  <dig> , which contributed to  <dig> % of the total mirnas. interestingly, the ratio of known mirnas sequence reads to total reads was  <dig>  and the ratio of novel mirnas was  <dig>  in the castrated male pigs, which differed from that in the intact male pigs, where the ratios were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

expression of mirna clusters in castrated and intact male pigs
usually, mirnas located consecutively within 10 kb of each other along the genome are considered as an mirna cluster  <cit> . in this study, the mirnas were categorized into different clusters based on their chromosome locations . briefly, there were  <dig> mirnas clusters detected in the f <dig> library, each of which had 2– <dig> mirnas. ten novel mirnas were grouped into eight mirna clusters. in the f <dig> library, there were  <dig> mirna clusters, each of which had two to four mirnas, and six novel mirnas were distributed into five mirna clusters . clustered mirnas can be coordinately transcribed as a polycistronic transcript or expressed individually. based on the obtained results more than half of the mirna clusters had a similar expression pattern . as an example the ssc-mir-181a- <dig> cluster includes ssc-mir-181a- <dig> and ssc-mir-181b- <dig>  two different mirnas according to the mirbase <dig>  database. in this study both of them were found to have a similar level of expression. another polycistronic mir- <dig> cluster showed a differential expression pattern. it contains six mature mirnas: ssc-mir- <dig>  ssc-mir-18a, ssc-mir-19a, ssc-mir- <dig>  ssc-mir-19b- <dig> and ssc-mir-92a-1; however, only ssc-mir- <dig>  ssc-mir-18a and ssc-mir-19a were expressed in castrated male pigs .

sequence variations between mirnas of castrated and intact male pigs
porcine mirnas frequently exhibit variation from their “reference” mirbase sequences , producing multiple mature variants that we herein refer to as isomirs  <cit> . sequence variations of mirna*s and isomirs were also observed in this study. there were  <dig>  mirna isomirs and  <dig> mirna* isomirs found in the f <dig> library, and different isomirs for a given mirna and mirna* ranged from two to  <dig> and two to  <dig>  respectively. in the f <dig> library,  <dig>  mirna isomirs and  <dig> mirna* isomirs were detected. the observed isomir number varied from two to  <dig>  there were  <dig> mirna genes in the f <dig> library and  <dig> in the f <dig> library that did not show any mature mirna or mirna* isomirs. in some cases, the most abundant sequence did not correspond exactly to the current porcine mirbase  <dig>  reference sequence. as an example, the size of ssc-mir- <dig> in our library was 23 bp , while the size of ssc-mir- <dig> in mirbase is 22 bp . ssc-mir-205* was identified in this study; however, it was not found in the mirbase database .

prediction of target genes and pathways analysis
to better understand the biological function of the  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated mirnas   in the castrated male pigs compared with intact male pigs, their target genes were predicted using targetscan and the ncbi entrez database. the predicted target genes were further classified to identify pathways that were actively regulated by mirnas in adipose tissues according to kegg functional annotations . the predicted target genes of mirnas that participate in signaling pathways, as shown by david kegg analysis, are shown in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  it is worth noting that the targets of the majority of up-regulated mirnas in the castrated pigs belonged to the mapk  signaling pathway, which is closely related to the inhibition of lipogenesis  <cit>  . another pathway targeted by over-represented mirnas is the wnt signaling pathway. this pathway is known to be involved in adipocyte lineage commitment, adipogenesis metabolism, and also inhibits adipogenesis through beta-catenin-dependent and -independent mechanisms. the wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway was reported to inhibit porcine adipogenic differentiation potential  <cit> . furthermore,  <dig> putative target genes, regulated by down-regulated mirnas, are involved in the gnrh signaling pathway. some target genes are also components of the insulin signaling pathway, which is related to the biological function of adipose tissue. another important pathway targeted by down-regulated mirnas in adipose tissue is the tgf-beta signaling pathway. this is associated with cellular functions, such as proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and migration  <cit> . based on our results, the tgfbr <dig> gene was the target of down-regulated ssc-mir-23b, ssc-mir-320a, ssc-mir- <dig>  ssc-mir-142-5p and mir- <dig>  tgfbr <dig> is part of the fat deposition-related tgf-beta signaling pathway and is known to inhibit adipose differentiation of preadipocyte cell lines and primary cultures  <cit> . all putative target genes and their involvement in signaling pathways are shown in additional file  <dig> 

validation of mirna expression with stem-loop rt-qpcr
stem-loop qpcr was adopted to validate the sequencing data. a total of eight mirnas were validated in the castrated and intact male pigs: ssc-mir- <dig>  ssc-mir-30a, sssc-mir-27a, ssc-mir- <dig>  ssc-mir- <dig>  ssc-mir-142-5p ssc-mir-f3-c <dig> and ssc-mir-7134-3p. the expression levels of ssc-mir- <dig>  ssc-mir-142-5p, ssc-mir-27a, ssc-mir-7134-3p and ssc-mir- <dig> were significantly higher in the intact male pigs than in the castrated male pigs, while the expression levels of ssc-mir-30a, ssc-mir- <dig> and ssc-mir-f3-c <dig> were lower in the intact male pigs . these data were consistent between rt-qpcr and solid sequencing. the detailed data is shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

discussion
the domestic pig is important economically for meat production and as a model for comparative genomics and biomedical studies  <cit> . the castration of domestic pigs has an important effect on the accumulation of adipose tissues  <cit> . the molecular mechanism behind this is still unclear. recent studies have provided some clues to solve this problem since they show that mirnas may play a regulatory role in white adipose tissue development in animals. to gain new insight into the role of mirnas in fat deposition in castrated pigs, novel and differentially expressed mirnas were identified by solid sequencing. the regulatory pathways of putative target genes were also analyzed in the castrated and intact male pigs. it was found that there were significantly different mirna expression patterns in backfat tissue between castrated and intact male pigs. the differences can be described according to two aspects. first is the varied expression of up-regulated and down-regulated genes. one hundred and seventy-seven mirnas, including  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated, had more than 2-fold differential expression between the castrated and intact male pigs . second is the specific expression of some mirnas in each library. we speculate that the above two differences might be a reason for the different fat deposition patterns of castrated and intact male pigs. in conclusion, mirnas may play an important role in backfat deposition in castrated male pigs.

ssc-mir- <dig> had the highest level of expression in pig backfat tissue among all expressed mirnas. moreover, it was expressed at a higher level in castrated male pigs than in intact pigs . this is consistent with ssc-mir- <dig> being the most highly expressed mirna  in the backfat of  <dig> day-old obese rongchang pigs  <cit> . in addition, mir- <dig> was up-regulated after differentiation induction in both human preadipocytes and mouse 3t3-l <dig> cells. it was also reported that the introduction of antisense oligonucleotides against mir- <dig> inhibited adipocyte differentiation by up-regulating mapk <dig>  which thereby reduced fat deposition. the above results suggested that the mir- <dig> plays a role in prompting adipocyte differentiation  <cit> . our results together with the above published findings show that mir- <dig> is directly related to fat deposition in pigs. a possible mechanism for this action is that mir- <dig> down-regulates mapk <dig>  and increases pparγ transcriptional activity by mediating its phosphorylation  <cit> . in addition, mapk <dig> is also a predicted target gene of ssc-mir- <dig>  ssc-mir-129-5p, ssc-mir-194a, ssc-mir-181a, ssc-mir-130a and ssc-mir- <dig> . we have previously shown that mapk <dig> expression is significantly decreased, while pparγ expression is increased in the backfat of castrated pigs compared with intact male pigs  <cit> , and both genes were involved in mapk signaling, which is an important pathway in fat deposition. it is likely that these mirnas promote the generation of pig adipose tissue by down-regulating mapk <dig> and up-regulating pparγ.

in contrast with mirnas regulating the mapk signaling pathway, five of the mirnas involved in the tgf-beta signaling pathway for fat deposition  had decreased levels of expression in castrated male pigs. however, the significantly different expression of mir- <dig> between castrated and intact male pigs  was unexpected because it is inconsistent with an increase in mir- <dig> expression during adipogenic differentiation of hascs  <cit> . the expression pattern of the let- <dig> gene family is another conflicting result since the expression of the let- <dig> gene family was undetected in this study, while previously it accounted for  <dig> % of the total mirna expression in pig fat  <cit> . the above inconsistences might be due to different fat-deposition patterns and different experimental designs.

we also observed a reduction in some mirna levels in the backfat of castrated male pigs compared with intact pigs. as an example, ssc-mir-27a and ssc-mir- <dig> were decreased by  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold in the castrated male pigs, respectively. this result is consistent with a previous report showing that ssc-mir-27a negatively regulates adipocyte differentiation by inhibiting the expression of pparγ <cit>  , and that mir- <dig> expression is also negatively correlated with cattle backfat thickness  <cit> . the fat mass and obesity associated  gene was reported to be associated with fat deposition in italian duroc pigs  <cit>  and its inactivation can protect from obesity  <cit> . fto was predicted by this research as a potential target of ssc-\mir- <dig>  ssc-f3-c <dig>  ssc-mir- <dig>  ssc-mir- <dig> and ssc-mir- <dig>  which were down-regulated in the castrated male pigs . these five down-regulated mirnas might play an important role in lipogenesis by targeting fto; however, this needs experimental verification.

levels of androgen and expression of the androgen receptor gene  dramatically decrease after castration  <cit> . in this study, we focused attention on ssc-mir-30a and ssc-mir-30e, which target the ar gene . levels of ssc-mir-30a were significantly increased in the backfat tissue in castrated male pigs compared with intact male pigs. this was consistent with a recent report showing that inhibition of mir-30a blocked adipogenesis, while over-expression of mir-30a stimulated human adipogenesis  <cit> . from these observations, we suggest that the increased fat deposition in castrated pigs may be caused by the inhibitory effect of mir-30a on ar expression since expression of fat deposition-related genes will also be relaxed if the transcription of ar and androgen are decreased. however, whether mir-30a can cleave the ar mrna needs to be further investigated. this rationale can be also applied to ssc-mir-30e, which exhibited a significant increase in the backfat tissue in castrated male pigs.

interestingly, the expression of known mirnas and mirna*s was detected in the constructed libraries. most mirna*s were expressed at very low levels. this is consistent with the fact that the expression of mature mirnas is always higher than that of the mirna*s. this may be due to the gene structure and/or spatial and temporal regulation. however, there is an inconsistent result from the f <dig> library; the expression of ssc-mir-30e*  was higher than that of ssc-mir-30e , indicating that this mirna*s is abundantly expressed, potentially as a functional guide mirna  <cit> . the expression of mir-30e* was significantly decreased in white adipose tissue of mice fed a high-fat diet  <cit> . our results therefore suggest that the high level of mir-30e* expression inhibited fat deposition in the intact male pigs. the ssc-mir-f3-c <dig> mirna and mirna* had the same expression level. the underlying reason for this may be that the 5′ ends of both mirna and mirna* have similar stabilities and, therefore, the same chance to combine with risc to avoid degradation  <cit> . similar expression patterns of mirna genes have also been identified in other species, such as chicken, fruit flies  <cit> . above results can be explained by a specific molecular mechanism; however, the quality of the different constructed libraries cannot be excluded as an explanation of the results.

several studies have shown that isomirs may function in animals  <cit> . here, the length of ssc-mir- <dig> varied from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides. the length variation occurred at the 3′ end of mirna, the 5′ end or both. this was mainly in the form of missing nucleotides and/or terminal additions of nucleotides and likely resulted from variations in the pre-mirna secondary structures. these variations result in variable cleavage sites for dicer or drosha. on the other hand, it cannot be excluded that these isomirs could have been generated by the digestion of mir- <dig>  the 5′ end variation may affect the seed region, which is at the 2nd-8th position of a mature mirna. the target of a mirna may alter owing to change in the nucleotides in this region. these end-sequence variations are intriguing as they may allow mirna variants to perform distinct roles by influencing mirna/target mrna hybrid duplex formation.

stem-loop rt-qpcr was adopted to validate the sequencing data. generally, the rt-qpcr validated the sequencing results and the results from the two different methods were consistent. however, there were few differences in expression levels, for example, the expression of ssc-mir- <dig>  ssc-mir-142-5p and ssc-mir-7134-3p were not detected in the castrated male pigs according to the solid sequencing, but a trace amount of expression was detected by rt-qpcr in the castrated male pigs. such discrepancies in detection levels might be caused by the sensitivity and capability of the different methods.

CONCLUSIONS
this study significantly expands the cohort of fat-related mirnas expressed in the pig and also identifies mirnas whose expression patterns alter significantly in response to castration. in total,  <dig> novel mirnas were identified in the backfat tissues from both castrated and intact male pigs. approximately  <dig> %  of the mirnas were found to have more than 2-fold differential expression between intact and castrated male pigs, with p-values <  <dig> . putative target genes of these mirnas and regulation pathways suggest that these mirnas may play a regulatory role in the adipose accumulation caused by castration. this research provides novel information for the study of human obesity.
