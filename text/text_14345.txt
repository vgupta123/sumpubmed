BACKGROUND
entamoeba histolytica, the protozoan causative of human amoebiasis, has a world-wide distribution with a higher prevalence in developing countries, affecting more than  <dig> million people each year  <cit> . trophozoites show a dramatic virulence variability that could be related to great genome plasticity  <cit> . frequent ploidy changes, unscheduled gene amplification and duplication have been reported  <cit> , and it has been largely assumed that these processes are linked to genetic rearrangements, although no direct experimental evidence has been provided yet.

in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, homologous recombination  is an accurate mechanism to generate genetic diversity. hr is also used by cells to properly repair the dna double strand-breaks . generally, this kind of damage is produced by genotoxic agents or during cellular processes like meiotic division, telomere maintenance, and restoration of collapsed replication forks in the course of dna synthesis  <cit> . cellular response to dna dsbs activates a complex network of proteins that transiently arrests cell cycle and enhances dna repair mechanisms. particularly, saccharomyces cerevisiae h2a and homo sapiens h2ax histones are rapidly phosphorylated in the chromatin micro-environment surrounding dna dsbs, inducing nucleosome remodeling to promote accumulation of checkpoint and dna repair proteins at these sites  <cit> . in case of extreme dna damage, cells are targeted to apoptosis  <cit> . additionally, hr is also a useful tool to analyze gene function by gene targeting and gene knock out approaches  <cit> .

molecular genetics of hr dna repair has been well preserved throughout evolution. rad <dig> epistasis group genes involved in dna dsb repair, including mre <dig>  rad <dig>  nsb1/xrs <dig>  rad <dig>  rad51c/rad <dig>  rad51b/rad <dig>  rad51d, xrcc <dig>  xrcc <dig>  rad <dig>  rad <dig>  rad54b/rdh <dig> and rad <dig> genes, have been identified in human and yeast cells  <cit> . pivotal protein in hr pathway is the rad <dig> recombinase, which catalyses strand transfer between a broken dna and its undamaged homologous strand, allowing damaged region to be repaired  <cit> . strand exchange reaction is initiated by rad51-coating of single-stranded dna  released from dsbs, to generate a nucleoprotein filament. this active thread binds the intact double-stranded dna  substrate, searching and locating homologous sequences, and promoting dna strand exchange in an atp-dependent manner, forming a heteroduplex structure called d-loop  <cit> . after dna damage, rad <dig> protein has been observed in nuclear complexes forming discrete foci, which are considered as the recombinational dna repair sites  <cit> .

hr remains the predominant mechanism to repair dsbs in lower eukaryotes  <cit> . rad <dig> proteins have been identified in trypanosoma brucei and plasmodium falciparum parasites, which perform hr to switch the expression of genes encoding surface membrane glycoproteins and generate antigenic variation  <cit> . furthermore, recombinational rearrangements are responsible for amplification of the multidrug resistance pfmdr <dig> gene in p. falciparum  <cit> , demonstrating the relevance of hr to generate genomic versatility and plasticity in protozoan parasites.

in this paper, we identified and analyzed the mrna expression profile of e. histolytica rad <dig> epistasis group related genes in response to dna damage. additionally, we presented experimental evidence of ehrad <dig> function as a recombinase, which suggest its potential role in dna damage response. these findings constitute the initial efforts to understand the dna repair mechanism in e. histolytica that will contribute to the further elucidation of events regulating genome integrity and variability in this early-branch protozoan.

RESULTS
high dose of uv-c light induces dna fragmentation in trophozoites
it has been shown in a wide variety of cells that x-rays exposure, uv irradiation and chemicals activate cellular responses to dna repair  <cit> . to initiate the study of the mechanisms involved in dna repair in e. histolytica, we used uv-c light irradiation to induce dna damage in trophozoites. our experiments showed that during the first  <dig> h after irradiation with  <dig> nm uv-c , cell survival was not significantly affected . using the same experimental conditions, we analyzed the presence of 3'-hydroxyl dna ends by tunel and facs assays. in untreated trophozoites, facs analysis evidenced the presence of <1% tunel positive cells; meanwhile,  <dig> min after treatment,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of uv-c irradiated cells showed dna fragmentation . dna damage reduction was observed at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h after treatment . propidium iodide stained cells were checked under the fluorescence microscope to confirm the absence of cytoplasmic stain .

the comet assay  is widely used to measure dna damage and repair. results obtained through neutral comet assay  confirmed the induction of dsbs in trophozoites by uv-c treatment. typical comet-like structures were observed at  <dig> min and  <dig> h, while a reduction of the dna tails was observed at  <dig> h after uv-c treatment. as expected,  <dig> h after the genotoxic insult, dna migration was similar to the control untreated cells . taking altogether, these data indicated that uv-c irradiation efficiently induced dna damage and consequently, repair mechanisms were activated to restore dna integrity allowing cell survival.

early ehh2ax histone phosphorylation correlates with the presence of dna dsbs
dna dsbs induce early phosphorylation of yeast h2a  and human h2ax histones on a conserved serine residue located in the sq motif at c terminus, producing γh2a and γh2ax, respectively  <cit> . as in yeast, e. histolytica seems to have replaced the canonical h2a with h2ax  <cit> . two genes  that encode putative proteins with  <dig> and 57% identity  to yeast h2a and human h2ax histones, respectively, were found in the e. histolytica genome. these genes predict two  <dig>  kda conserved paralogous h2ax proteins that share 93% identity. notably, both contain the h2ax exclusive sq motif with the potentially phosphorylable serine residue  .

taking advantage of the high conservation between h. sapiens and e. histolytica h2ax c-terminus, we performed western blot assays using the anti-human γh2ax antibody to detect serine-phosphorylated ehh2ax homologues  in cytoplasmic  and nuclear  extracts of trophozoites. protein amount and integrity were confirmed on coomassie blue stained-gels . in ne from non-irradiated cells, we identified a 17-kda weak band, which corresponds to the expected molecular weight of γehh2ax histones . interestingly,  <dig> min after uv-c irradiation, this band was five-fold more intense, suggesting an increase in the amount of nuclear γehh2ax, and  <dig> min after treatment no band was found . however, these assays did not allow us to distinguish whether one or both ehh2ax proteins were phosphorylated. in contrast, no signals were observed in ce . we used as an integrity control an anti-ehpap serum, which recognized the 63-kda ehpap protein  <cit>  in non-irradiated and irradiated trophozoites . in addition, an anti-actin monoclonal antibody, used as control for cell fractionation, strongly detected the expected 42-kda band in ce and a slight signal in ne, as expected for a major component of cytoskeleton . these data showed that uv-c irradiation of trophozoites is a useful model to generate dna dsbs and study dna repair in e. histolytica.

e. histolytica genome contains rad <dig> epistasis group related genes
in order to investigate the presence of rad <dig> epistasis group related genes in e. histolytica genome, we surveyed the parasite pathema database . we found ehmre <dig>  ehrad <dig> and ehnbs <dig> genes, which could encode the e. histolytica putative mre11-rad50-nbs <dig> protein complex that functions as the primary sensor of dna dsbs in other organisms  <cit> . both ehmre <dig> and ehrad <dig> proteins exhibited  <dig> to 23% identities  with s. cerevisiae and h. sapiens orthologous proteins, respectively; whereas the ehnbs <dig> sequence appears to be more divergent . e. histolytica also contains genes encoding the putative recombinase ehrad <dig> and its paralogous protein ehrad51c. ehrad <dig>  ehrad <dig>  ehrad54b and ehrad <dig>  predicted proteins are also encoded in the e. histolytica genome. as in yeast, rad <dig> paralogs  that participate in hr in vertebrates were not found in e. histolytica . in conclusion, e. histolytica genome contains a conserved set of repair genes, which suggests that it is skilled to perform recombinational dna repair.

e. histolytica genes of the rad <dig> epistasis group are differentially expressed in response to uv-c irradiation
as a first step towards establishing the role of the e. histolytica rad <dig> epistasis group related genes, we evaluated their mrna expression by semi-quantitative rt-pcr using the uv-c irradiation model described above. most genes exhibited a differential mrna expression profile before and after irradiation . ehmre <dig>  ehrad <dig>  ehrad51c and ehrad <dig> genes were transcribed at a very low level in non-irradiated trophozoites; meanwhile mrna expression was induced from  <dig> min to  <dig> h after genotoxic damage. particularly, the ehrad <dig> mrna expression was 16-, 11- and 4-fold increased at  <dig> min,  <dig> h and  <dig> h, respectively, after uv-c irradiation, when compared with untreated cells . on the other hand, the ehnbs <dig>  ehrad <dig> and ehrad <dig> genes were abundantly transcribed in untreated trophozoites; however, mrna levels were down-regulated after uv-c treatment. the ehrad <dig> gene expression showed the highest steady-state mrna levels in non-irradiated trophozoites. at  <dig> min after uv-c irradiation, ehrad <dig> transcript levels dropped drastically;  <dig> h later, they moderately increased, and at  <dig> h they diminished again. in contrast, ehrad54b gene did not seem to be expressed under the experimental conditions tested here . we observed minimal changes in the 25s rrna expression used as control . these data showed that e. histolytica rad <dig> epistasis group related genes were differentially expressed in response to dna damage.

the predicted ehrad <dig> conserves the typical architecture of reca/rad <dig> family members
since rad <dig> recombinases are considered as key enzymes in hr and dna repair processes in many organisms  <cit> , we focused on the characterization of the e. histolytica ehrad <dig> protein. ehrad <dig> is an intron-less  <dig> bp gene, which encodes a  <dig> amino acids  polypeptide . sequence similarity searches by blast showed the lowest e-values  and high identity  with many eukaryotic rad <dig> proteins, from plants to human, including protozoan parasites. moreover, ehrad <dig> showed 51% and 36% identity with methanococcus voltae rada and escherichia coli reca bacterial recombinases, respectively . amino acid sequence alignment of ehrad <dig> protein with yeast and human rad <dig> orthologs revealed that these proteins share functional and structural conserved motifs . ehrad <dig> contains the putative polymerization motif , which tethers individual subunits to form quaternary assemblies in human rad <dig> protein  <cit>  . we also identified the atpase walker a or phosphate binding loop  and walker b motifs , the ssdna binding loops l <dig>  and l <dig> , as well as the atp-stacking motif or atp cap  at the c-terminus, which are essential for nucleofilament assembling and atp hydrolysis in rad51/reca-like recombinases  <cit> . remarkably, the ehrad <dig> n-terminus has a low-complexity region of 34-aa highly enriched in glutamic residues, which is not present in homologous proteins . phylogenetic relationships among ehrad <dig> and rad51/reca related proteins from diverse organisms, revealed a progressive evolution from eubacteria to eukaryotes, being ehrad <dig> more related to protozoan recombinases .

the ehrad <dig> protein is overexpressed in response to dna damage
the recombinant ehrad <dig> protein  was expressed in e. coli bl <dig>  plyss strain as a 6x his-tagged fusion polypeptide and subsequently purified by affinity chromatography . by western blot assays using monoclonal anti-6xhis tag antibodies, the purified rehrad <dig> was detected as a single  <dig> kda band, which was slightly higher than the  <dig>  kda expected weight . then, rehrad <dig> was used to generate rabbit polyclonal anti-ehrad <dig> antibodies. these antibodies recognized the  <dig> kda rehrad <dig> band , whereas the preimmune serum, used as negative control, did not detect any signal . to evaluate the expression of the native ehrad <dig> in e. histolytica, we performed western blot assays using anti-ehrad <dig> antibodies and protein extracts from irradiated and non-irradiated trophozoites. antibodies reacted with a weak  <dig> kda band in ce from non treated trophozoites, but not signal was detected in ne . meanwhile, at  <dig> min after uv-c irradiation, antibodies strongly detected the expected  <dig> kda endogenous ehrad <dig> in ce, but not in ne . intriguingly, antibodies also detected a  <dig> kda band in both ne and ce from uv-c irradiated trophozoites, which may correspond to a modified form of the  <dig> kda protein. the specificity of anti-ehrad <dig> antibodies was confirmed performing a similar western blot assay using anti-ehrad <dig> antibodies previously pre-incubated with purified rehrad <dig> protein and the recognition of both  <dig> and  <dig> kda proteins was specifically inhibited . in addition, the use of anti-ehpap and anti-actin antibodies confirmed protein integrity and cell fractionation of ce and ne . our findings showed that ehrad <dig> was overexpressed in response to uv-c irradiation, and distributed in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments.

ehrad <dig> relocalizes into nuclear foci-like structures in response to dna damage
in order to better characterize the ehrad <dig> expression and function, we investigated its subcellular location in trophozoites through immunofluorescence and laser confocal microscopy. in agreement with the western blot results, ehrad <dig> was detected at low levels in the cytosol of non-irradiated trophozoites , whereas at  <dig> min after uv-c irradiation we noted a dramatic accumulation of cytoplasmic ehrad <dig> protein. interestingly, we also observed a scattered distribution of ehrad <dig> typical foci-like structures in the nucleus . three hours later, the cytoplasmic signal diminished, while nuclear foci-like structures remained . at  <dig> h after genotoxic damage, both cytoplasmic and nuclear ehrad <dig> signals were very weak, being ehrad <dig> foci-like structures scarce . quantification of nuclear foci like-structures by statistical microscopic analysis showed that about 60% of the cells contained at least one focus at  <dig> min after uv-c irradiation . these findings confirmed that ehrad <dig> was up-regulated after uv-c irradiation and suggested that it was redistributed into the nucleus during the first  <dig> h after dna damage.

rehrad <dig> exhibits dna binding activity in vitro
in silico analysis of the ehrad <dig> aa sequence evidenced the presence of two putative dna binding domains. to verify that ehrad <dig> is a dna binding protein, we performed emsa using increasing amounts of purified rehrad <dig> protein and a fixed concentration of radiolabeled 50-bp ssdna or 270-bp dsdna fragments as probes. in order to discard interactions of contaminant e. coli proteins with dna probes, we used mock purified fractions obtained from untransformed bacteria as a negative control. results showed that incubation of rehrad <dig> with ssdna and dsdna probes resulted in five dna-protein complexes  formation, suggesting that alternative populations of rad <dig> protomers were associated to each dna probes . the fastest migration ssdna-protein complex ci that was also formed with the mock fraction was considered as unspecific . no complexes were formed in the emsa control performed with the dsdna probe . notably, the abundance of slow migration dna-protein complexes appeared to increase in the presence of the highest rehrad <dig> amount . these results showed that rehrad <dig> was able to efficiently bind both ssdna and dsdna substrates in vitro.

rehrad <dig> exhibits homologous dna strand transfer activity in vitro
in order to evaluate the homologous dna strand transfer function of the rehrad <dig> protein, we performed a pairing assay involving the d-loop structure formation as described in experimental procedures. results revealed that rehrad <dig> was able to shift the electrophoretic mobility of the radioactive-labeled 200-bp ssdna probe incubated with homologous circular dsdna . this indicated that rehrad <dig> was able to catalyze ssdna transfer to homologous dsdna forming the three-stranded pairing molecule or d-loop structure, which has a reduced electrophoretic mobility in comparison with the ssdna probe. the d-loop formation specificity was confirmed by incubation of rehrad <dig> and ssdna probe in the absence of homologous dsdna substrate , and in the presence of a heterologous dsdna substrate , since no complex was observed. in addition, we did not observe any d-loop structure in the absence of rehrad <dig> . densitometric analysis of radioactive products showed that d-loop structure formation using  <dig>  μg of rehrad <dig> was  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold higher than with  <dig>  and  <dig> μg of rehrad <dig>  respectively . these results indicated that ehrad <dig> protein was able to catalyze specific dna paring and exchange between dna homologous strands in vitro.

discussion
while non-homologous end joining plays a major role in dsb dna repair in higher eukaryotes including mammals, hr remains the predominant mechanism to repair this kind of lesions in lower eukaryotes  <cit> . the high amount of repetitive dna in protozoan parasites, such as e. histolytica, suggests that the genome of these organisms can be potentially recombinogenic. therefore, the study of hr process in e. histolytica may advance our understanding about trophozoites genetic and virulence variability, as well as dna repair mechanisms.

here, we developed a  <dig> nm uv-c light irradiation model, which induces dna damage in e. histolytica trophozoites and activates recombinational dna repair pathway. irradiation dose  and time  were determined as no lethal conditions for cells in comparison with other uv doses previously evaluated. growth curves were performed up to  <dig> h, the doubling time of trophozoites, without observing any significant changes . early phosphorylation of e. histolytica h2ax histones after uv-c irradiation was consistent with dna dsbs formation, suggesting chromatin remodeling and recruitment of histone-phosphorylating enzymes, as observed in other eukaryotic systems  <cit> . moreover, e histolytica trophozoites survival throughout almost  <dig> h after irradiation indicated the existence and activation of dna repair mechanisms. in silico analysis of the e. histolytica genome sequence revealed that this pathogen has genes that encode putative ehrad <dig> epistasis group members, which participate in recombinational dna repair in other organims. given the place of this ancient protista in the eukaryote phylogenetic scale, ehrad <dig> epistasis group had equivalent similarity with homologous proteins from different organisms, such as mammals, plants and other protozoan parasites.

rt-pcr assays evidenced a differential mrna expression of e. histolytica rad <dig> epistasis group genes, before and after dna damage. some genes  were down-regulated after dna damage, others  were up-regulated at different times following genotoxic stimulus, whereas ehrad <dig> mrna levels were regulated in a variable manner, suggesting a complex transcriptional response. interestingly, ehrad54b gene did not seem to be transcribed under our experimental conditions. however, in yeast and human, both rad <dig> and rad54b are dna helicases which participate in the formation of heteroduplex dna in recombination processes  <cit> . it is possible that the expression of ehrad <dig> homolog is sufficient to cover this activity in trophozoites, although additional experiments are required to confirm this hypothesis. the absence of a coordinated transcriptional activation of ehrad <dig> epistasis group genes suggest that trophozoites have enough stationary levels of enzymes for dbb repair and the main regulation could be occurring at translational and/or posttranslational level. a further evaluation of ehrad <dig> epistasis group proteins regulation in response to dna damage will help us to better understand dna repair by hr in e. histolytica. it seems that the molecular events related to dna lesions produced by genotoxic agents can be barely inferred from gene expression profiling. indeed, studies in yeast and mammals have shown no-relationship between genes whose expression is increased after different dna-damaging treatments  and those genes that are involved in protecting against cytotoxicity to the same agents  <cit> .

we focused on ehrad <dig> gene because rad <dig> proteins have been demonstrated as key players in recombinational dna repair in lower and higher eukaryotes . interestingly, the ehrad <dig> transcript steady state levels were about 15-fold higher at  <dig> min post-uv-c treatment and decreased  <dig> and  <dig> h later, suggesting that ehrad <dig> could be participating in hr in the early steps of dna repair. similar transcriptional activation after uv treatment has been reported as a common characteristic for reca/rad <dig> homologs of tetrahymena thermophila  <cit>  and halobacterium sp.  <cit> . in agreement with the rt-pcr results, western blot assays showed a dramatic increase of ehrad <dig> in cytoplasm and nucleus,  <dig> min after dna breaks were introduced into the e. histolytica genome. the fact that specific polyclonal antibodies immunodetected a  <dig> kda ehrad <dig> protein suggest that some posttranslational modifications of the cytoplasmic  <dig> kda ehrad <dig> could be a requirement for its translocation to the nucleus where dna repair takes place. taking in consideration that the ehrad <dig> sequence lacks a nuclear localization signal, an alternative possibility might be that ehrad <dig> needs to interact with other protein to be transported inside the nucleus. however, additional experiments are required to corroborate these hypotheses.

as observed for yeast and human homologs  <cit> , laser confocal microscopy evidenced focal sites of the ehrad <dig> protein scattered in the nucleus at  <dig> min and  <dig> h after dna damage. congruently, the ehrad <dig> nuclear foci-like structure occurrence was consistent with the dna fragmentation degree observed in tunel and neutral comet assays. since uv-c treatment did not affect trophozoites viability, it is tempting to suggest that dna repair mechanisms involving ehrad <dig> foci formation were activated to restore genome integrity after genotoxic insult.

in silico analysis demonstrated that the predicted ehrad <dig> protein contains all functional and structural motifs that are important for reca/rad <dig> recombinases activities. to experimentally support its role in dna repair by hr, we performed the basic characterization of ehrad <dig> protein. ehrad <dig> functional properties were similar to those previously reported for rad <dig> homologous  <cit> . ehrad <dig> was able to bind both ssdna and dsdna substrates in the presence of atp and mg2+. the various rehrad51-dna complexes may be related to different amounts of rehrad <dig> molecules bound to ssdna or dsdna probe. finally, ehrad <dig> promoted specific three-stranded pairing structure formation or d-loop. based on the data presented here, we proposed a working model for dna dsb repair involving the ehrad <dig> recombinase. when a dsb is introduced in e. histolytica genome, ehh2ax histones become phosphorylated, which could induce chromatin remodeling and accumulation of the ehrad <dig> epistasis group proteins at the dna dsb site. we observed that ehrad <dig> was relocated into the dna repair nuclear foci, where it could mediate dna paring and homologous strand exchange to restore genome integrity. it is also possible that e. histolytica rad <dig> protein may play a role in genome rearrangements that naturally occur within this organism during dna synthesis. therefore, it will be interesting to evaluate its involvement in frequent ploidy changes, unscheduled gene amplification and duplication events observed in e. histolytica genome  <cit> . our next challenge will involve studying in vivo hr and the relevant role of ehrad <dig> in this process in e. histolytica.

CONCLUSIONS
our results provide the first data supporting the role of the rad <dig> epistasis group genes in dna repair process in e. histolytica. we showed that e. histolytica rad <dig> epistasis group genes, were differentially expressed when dna fragmentation was induced by uv-c irradiation. we also showed that ehrad <dig> protein was overexpressed and relocalized in nuclear foci-like structures after dna damage, and demonstrated that recombinant ehrad <dig> function as a recombinase in vitro. these data evidenced a potential role of ehrad <dig> protein in dna damage response in this ancient eukaryotic parasite.
