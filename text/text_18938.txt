BACKGROUND
the haematopoietic growth factor erythropoietin  has been in clinical use for over  <dig> years to treat patients with anaemic conditions, ranging from renal failure to cancer. upon introduction of epo to the clinic, it was observed that cognitive performance of treated individuals also improved. this improvement was essentially attributed to anaemia correction with subsequently enhanced tissue oxygenation also in the brain  <cit> . much later, epo and its receptor were found to be produced by and act on cells of the nervous system  <cit> . many reports on neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects of epo in rodent models of neurological diseases followed  <cit>  . our recent human studies in schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis revealed profound epo effects on cognitive performance  <cit> . the separation of haematopoietic and neuroprotective properties upon slight modification of the epo molecule ultimately proved the haematopoiesis-independent effect of epo on the nervous system  <cit> .

to investigate, in the absence of interfering disease variables, the physiological role of the brain epo system regarding cognition, we performed a series of studies in healthy young mice where we found hippocampal memory, measured by classical fear conditioning, improved after  <dig> weeks of epo treatment. at the time of improved memory, an increase in short-term and long-term potentiation was documented in hippocampal slices  <cit> . along the same lines, application of a single high intravenous dose of epo in healthy human volunteers enhanced the hippocampal response during memory retrieval measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging one week later  <cit> . it should, however, be also mentioned that preclinical studies using disease models failed to show effects of epo treatment on cognition in their respective healthy control groups . this is most likely explained by the application of tests , well suited to measure pathology but less sensitive for assessing subtle improvements in cognitive performance in healthy individuals.

since the development of new therapies, targeting cognitive performance is of major interest for clinical neuroscience, and epo might here be a promising candidate; thus the spectrum of cognitive functions potentially influenced by epo has to be better defined. for this purpose, we employed the five choice serial reaction time task , originally developed for rats by carli and colleagues  <cit>  and adapted for mice by humby and co-workers  <cit> . the 5csrtt has been used to analyse attention and executive functions in different rodent models of neuropsychiatric diseases, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder  <cit> , schizophrenia  <cit>  and impulsivity disorders  <cit>  . with 5csrtt, we systematically studied the effect of epo on different types of learning, memory and attention in healthy young mice. we note that obtaining cognitive results in healthy young individuals cannot automatically be translated to disease situations or aged mice. nevertheless, this approach is the simplest first step to providing a foundation for mechanistic insight. we report here that early epo treatment indeed improves most of the sequential learning and memory components of a complex long-term cognitive task, ultimately leading to better and more stable cognitive achievements.

RESULTS
erythropoietin increases overall performance in 5csrtt
first, we compared the overall performance of epo, placebo, or no-inject groups in 5csrtt. kaplan-meier analysis revealed that the proportion of mice that finished training in the 5csrtt  up to day  <dig> after cessation of treatment was significantly higher in the epo-treated group as compared with placebo and no-inject groups . there were no differences between placebo and no-inject groups . taken as a group, epo-treated mice learn faster.

erythropoietin accelerates associative, operant and discriminant learning in 5csrtt
since different types of learning determine performance in the 5csrtt, we asked whether the superiority of epo-treated mice is reflected in initial learning parameters. indeed, the number of head entries during habituation and magazine training appeared higher throughout all phases  in epo-treated mice compared with the placebo group . a significant difference between groups in phases m <dig> and m <dig> of magazine training by kruskal-wallis test  could be attributed to superior performance of the epo versus placebo group following post hoc analysis . during the operant learning phase , epo-treated mice made more nose pokes  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) on days  <dig> and  <dig>  . additionally, there was a significant group effect in the discriminant learning phase , with epo-treated mice demonstrating higher choice accuracy  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) .

we wondered whether the improvement in operant and discriminant learning parameters would continue in face of more complex conditions and thus enhanced cognitive challenge during the 5csrtt training. in fact, the 5csrtt procedure is much more complex than the preceding shaping phases and consists of more parallel stimuli in addition to stimulus duration . we analysed accuracy in the consecutive stimulus duration phases:  <dig> sec,  <dig> sec and  <dig> sec. the percentage of correct responses over the first  <dig> days of each phase served as readout of initial learning capabilities in the 5csrtt training . epo-treated mice performed better in 16-sec and 8-sec phases  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig>  and f =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> , respectively, figure 2d and 2e), but no longer in the following ones, from  <dig> sec  to  <dig> sec,  <dig>  sec,  <dig>  sec,  <dig>  sec and  <dig>  sec . overall accuracy increased over consecutive phases until reaching a plateau at  <dig> sec for both groups, which then stayed essentially stable over the following shorter-duration phases . there was no consistent difference in accuracy  during the attentional challenge phase of  <dig>  sec  =  <dig> , p =  <dig>  and f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> , respectively).

erythropoietin improves task adaptation and stabilizes performance in 5csrtt
we next analysed the number of training days required to reach performance criteria in 5csrtt for each stimulus duration, that is, acquisition days . there was a significant effect of stimulus duration on the number of training days needed, independent of treatment  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). starting immediately from  <dig> sec, mice required more days to reach criteria compared with previous phases. to further address the phenomenon of an abrupt increase of training days in the 2-sec phase , we analysed omissions more closely. in fact, omissions in all training phases from  <dig> sec to  <dig> sec were comparable between the two experimental groups, and rates were low up to the switch from the 4-sec to the 2-sec phase . it turned out that from the 4-sec phase to the 2-sec phase, omissions promptly doubled and stayed at a high level up to the end of 5csrtt training , independent of treatment group. this may explain the prominent increase in training day requirement starting from  <dig> sec.

we next averaged omitted trials in each of the six 10-trial blocks over the first  <dig> days of this 2-sec phase . there was no significant overall effect of treatment; however, there was a significant interaction between trial block and treatment  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). post hoc analysis revealed that epo-treated mice had significantly fewer omissions in the first trial block compared with controls , pointing to a faster adaptation to the task.

as fluctuations in performance may increase the number of days needed for reaching performance criteria, we analysed the magnitude of fluctuation  in the 2-sec phase. here, the control group had significantly more relapses compared with the epo group, pointing to more stable performance upon epo  . to further explore the effect of epo on stability of performance, we analysed total omissions after reaching criteria  over additional  <dig> days. epo-treated mice were superior  as compared with the control group .

erythropoietin does not affect locomotor activity in 5csrtt
to clarify whether increased locomotion has contributed to the superior performance of epo-treated mice in phases with 16-sec and 8-sec stimulus duration, we analysed the average of reward latency  as well as the 'latency correct'  in the corresponding phases. there were no differences between groups in either reward latency or in 'latency correct' in any phase of the 5csrtt training .

discussion
in the present study, a 3-week high-dose epo treatment of healthy young mice increased the probability of these animals finishing training in the 5csrtt. while there were no differences in the number of total days needed to terminate the task among ultimately successful individual mice, regardless of group assignment, the proportion per group was different, with more successful mice in the epo-treated cohort. epo-treated mice showed superior performance in associative, operant and discriminant learning as well as in initial 5csrtt training phases. moreover, epo-treated mice demonstrated better task adaptation and higher performance stability. in contrast, with the number of mice remaining in the task, there were no clear effects with this particular epo treatment schedule  on attentional performance, as defined by response to the  <dig> -sec stimulus duration.

to gain an overall impression of the progress in cognitive training of our mouse groups, we employed the survival analysis of kaplan-meier. this methodological approach was crucial for our purposes as it describes, over a long testing period, the development of group performance in a higher cognitive task, the 5csrtt. by applying standard statistical methods only, the clear superiority of the epo group would not have been detectable. in fact, the kaplan-meier results inspired us to dissect out potential learning processes contributing to the superior group performance of epo-treated mice. the success of this statistical approach would suggest the usefulness of this method for future group analysis in the 5csrtt.

while clear benefits of epo treatment could easily be demonstrated throughout all initial learning phases including the 5csrtt training up to 8-sec stimulus duration, we did not find differences in accuracy in phases with stimulus durations of  <dig> sec and below. this might be due to a ceiling effect, as both groups had reached almost maximal performance at this stage. nevertheless, also in these more progressed phases, epo superiority was visible when analysing more subtle readouts of cognitive performance, for example, stability and task adaptation.

a particularly difficult 5csrtt training step for mice is the switching from the 4-sec to the 2-sec stimulus duration phase. in this challenging phase, epo-treated mice had consistently lower omission rates when entering the task, indicating immediate task adaptation. this improvement just failed to translate into significant differences in acquisition days. interestingly, a previous study on galanin transgenic mice, a model for impaired learning capacity, reported for this critical 2-sec phase more than doubling of required training days compared with controls, due to more omissions  <cit> . in contrast to the improved task adaptation shown in the present study, reflected by less omissions in the first trial block, galanin transgenic mice exhibited more omissions in the last two trial blocks, pointing to deficiency of sustained attention  <cit> . in contrast to all other studies employing 5csrtt, we have additionally analysed parameters representing stability of performance. the analysis of relapse frequency  in the challenging 2-sec stimulus duration phase with its increasing attentional challenge again revealed a more consistent performance by the epo group.

an important limitation of the current study  has to be addressed: the strong selection bias of mice with higher cognitive abilities means that mice that do not learn crucial steps of the task are excluded from further testing . this gradual decrease of numbers in advanced training phases renders statistical analysis increasingly difficult. for instance, in the current study, there would not have been enough mice in the placebo and the no-inject group for separate analysis in the attentional phase with stimulus duration of  <dig>  sec, despite starting out with  <dig> mice per group. a total of  <dig> mice to be run simultaneously in this task already reaches the limits of a generous set-up of five chambers and more than a full working day of the investigator. since performance of placebo and no-inject groups did not differ much in the early phases, pooling of both groups to obtain a 'control cohort' was possible.

CONCLUSIONS
the findings of the present study, that is, improved sequential learning and memory components of a complex long-term cognitive task upon epo treatment, will provide the basis for further work targeting molecular facets of these critical phases. such studies will include quantitative and qualitative evaluation of neurogenesis and synapse formation in respective brain regions, for example, cingulate cortex and hippocampus. in the latter, we recently detected increased long-term potentiation after epo treatment  <cit> . in addition, future work will have to assess whether the effects of epo obtained here are restricted to the use of very young and healthy animals, or would be similarly strong in older mice and/or disease conditions. further untangling of molecular mechanisms of epo action on higher cognitive functions may then ultimately open new avenues for prevention strategies and therapeutic interventions in neuropsychiatric diseases.
