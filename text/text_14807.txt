BACKGROUND
bacterial strains belonging to the enterobacteriaceae species escherichia coli are common as commensals in the intestinal flora of humans and warm-blooded animals  <cit> . typing systems for identification of related e. coli strains were developed in the early 1940ies when it became evident that certain e. coli strains were agents of infantile gastroenteritis  <cit> . in  <dig>  kauffmann established the method of serological typing for e. coli o-  and h- antigens which allowed the grouping of e. coli strains according to their o:h-types   <cit> . serotyping proved to be widely useful for identification of enteropathogenic e. coli  strains from stools of diarrhoeic infants  <cit>  and is successfully employed for characterization of pathogenic e. coli strains from both humans and animals  <cit> .

the genetic analysis of e. coli populations by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis  and multilocus sequence typing  allowed the detection of clonal types of strains which carry specific virulence markers and are associated with disease in humans  <cit> . it was shown that the o:h serotype is a good marker for identification of strains belonging to clonal types of pathogenic e. coli  <cit> . at present,  <dig> o- and  <dig> h-antigens are described for e. coli which can occur in different combinations in wildtype isolates of strains  <cit> . however, the large number of o- and h-antisera which are needed for e. coli serotyping and the laborious typing procedure restricts its usage to a few reference laboratories. therefore, alternative typing methods were developed including molecular characterization of genes coding for the o- and h-antigens in e. coli  <cit> . typing of flic genes by pcr was successfully employed for characterization of human pathogenic o157:h <dig> and o26:h <dig> strains  <cit> . analysis of the nucleotide sequence of flic genes coding for flagellar antigens h <dig> and h <dig> revealed large sequence similarities between strains sharing the same h-type but different o-types  <cit> . moreover, molecular typing of the flic gene allows h-typing of non-flagellated  e. coli isolates which cannot be analyzed for their flagella with h-specific antisera  <cit> .

the flagellar type h <dig> is frequently occurring in e. coli belonging to many different o-groups including strains of shiga toxin-producing e. coli  and extraintestinal pathogenic serotypes  <cit> , . moreover, a cryptic flic-h <dig> gene was described to be present and to be spontaneously expressed in e. coli strain p12b  which carries another type of flagella called h <dig> which is not encoded by the flic gene  <cit> . therefore, we became interested in the genetic variability of flagellar h <dig> genes in e. coli strains belonging to different o-serogroups and pathotypes. we have used the published nucleotide sequence of the flic gene present in the e. coli h <dig> reference strain u9- <dig>  to develop a pcr which allows discrimination between the flic-h <dig> gene variants. nucleotide sequence analysis of the flic gene was performed on other e. coli h <dig> strains that either showed deviations in the pcr analysis or were reported to harbour allelic types of the h4-flic gene  <cit>  or revealed differences in the agglutination reaction compared to the reference strains. to study the expression of different flagellar h <dig> types we have cloned their corresponding flic genes and have introduced them into the laboratory e. coli k- <dig> strain jm <dig>  <cit> . expression of recombinant flagella was demonstrated by serotyping and by immuno electron microscopy.

RESULTS
serological detection of the flagellar h <dig> antigen in different e. coli wildtype host strains
e. coli reference strains u9- <dig>  and p12b   <cit>  and the e. coli k- <dig> strain jm <dig>  , which was used for expression studies were investigated for inhibition of motility in swarm-agar containing 1: <dig> dilutions of either h <dig>  or h48-antiserum . u9- <dig> and p12b were fully inhibited for their motility in the presence of h <dig> antiserum derived from strains u9- <dig> or from p12b but not in the presence of h <dig> specific antiserum. the e. coli k- <dig> strain jm <dig> was not inhibited for motility by h <dig> antisera but by h <dig> antiserum. these findings indicate that h <dig> antisera specifically inhibited the motility of e. coli h <dig> strains and that the antigenically different flagellar type h <dig> was not expressed or lost in our p12b isolate, similar as previously described with spontaneously arising variants of p12b  <cit> . we became interested if other e. coli h <dig> strains would also carry the genes for expression of h <dig> type flagella as it was described for p12b  <cit> . for this, we have investigated five additional e. coli h <dig> strains  for their serological reaction with different h <dig> specific antisera and all strains showed specific positive reactions . h-serotyping performed with strains from the collection of the robert koch-institute revealed  <dig> e. coli strains which agglutinated with h <dig> antisera and the results obtained with  <dig> representative strains are shown in table  <dig>  all strains agglutinated with both, h4u9- <dig> and h4p12b antiserum, but were not agglutinating with antisera made against other h-antigens . differences in agglutinating titers between h4u9- <dig> and h4p12b antisera were not more than twofold with either strain indicating that both sera were similar for their specificity . the strains p7d, e1541- <dig>  107- <dig> and 305- <dig> showed significantly lower agglutination titers with h <dig> antisera than did the reference strains u9- <dig> and p12b, which had been used for production of h <dig> typing sera, respectively . these findings prompted us to compare all the h <dig> strains with all other e. coli h-types for polymorphisms in the flic gene by hhai digestion of flic-pcr products as described in the method section.

hhai-rflp typing of flic genes in e. coli
pcr products obtained with primers flic- <dig> and flic- <dig> were digested with hhai to obtain h-serotype specific rflp patterns from reference strains for the  <dig> different e. coli h-serotypes  <cit> . hhai-rflp typing of e. coli flic genes coding for flagellar types h <dig> to h <dig> revealed individual patterns corresponding to the different h-serotypes . flagellar antigens h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig> were reported to be not encoded by flic but by other genes  in the corresponding e. coli strains and the flic hhai patterns obtained from these strains do therefore not correspond to their h-serotypes  <cit> . hhai-rflp patterns were found conserved among strains sharing the same h-serotype independent of their o-antigen as previously described  <cit>  . an exception was found for h-serotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in which single strains possessed different hhai-rflp patterns when compared with the corresponding h-type reference strain . the hhai-rflp patterns of different h-types were distinguishable from each other . the results from hhai-rflp typing corresponded with the earlier reports showing that the flic gene in strain p12b codes for flagella of serotype h <dig>  the relationship between flic genes present in the different e. coli strains was further investigated by nucleotide sequencing.

nucleotide sequence analysis of the flic genes present in representative e. coli h <dig> strains
to obtain the entire coding region of the flic gene in e. coli strains oligonucleotide primers flic- <dig> and flic- <dig> were deduced from the flic-h <dig> chromosomal region and applied to amplify the corresponding chromosomal regions from e. coli strains u9- <dig> , p12b , u1- <dig> , p7d , c107- <dig>  and e1541- <dig>  as listed in table  <dig>  these strains were taken as flagellar type h <dig> representatives according to previously published results  <cit>  and according to the h-serotyping performed in this study. the analysis of the coding sequences of the flic genes present in these strains revealed in all cases a length of  <dig> bp. as a control, the flic gene of the strain u9- <dig> was sequenced and found to be identical to the previously deposited flic sequence . the identity of the flic-h <dig> sequences ranges from  <dig>  % to  <dig> %. the greatest sequence difference to the flic gene coding sequence of strain u9- <dig> was found in the flic gene of strain p7d , whereas the flic sequences of strains u1- <dig> and u9- <dig> were identical to each other. all deduced flagellins have a length of  <dig> amino acids. the greatest deviation in the primary structure to the flic protein of the reference strain u9- <dig> was again observed for the flic protein of strain p7d . fig.  <dig> shows the alignment of the deduced flic proteins of all investigated strains. the flic protein of strain u1- <dig> is 100% identical to that of strain u9- <dig> and therefore not shown. similarities of the deduced amino acid sequences of the flic proteins  are summarized in table  <dig> 

pcr based detection of flic-h <dig> specific dna sequences
amplification of the flic genes present in e. coli strains u9- <dig> and p12b with primers flic- <dig> and flic- <dig> resulted in the generation of a  <dig> bp internal pcr product with both strains . the nucleotide sequences of this stretch of dna of strains u9- <dig> and p12b were compared for restriction enzymes which cut at different sites in the flic-h4u9- <dig> and flic-h4p12b sequence. hhai was found to cut at identical sites confirming the results from hhai rflp typing . in contrast, enzymes hpaii and mboi were found to generate each different restriction fragments from pcr products of the flic-h4u9- <dig> and flic-h4p12b gene, respectively. both enzymes were taken for rflp typing of amplified flic genes  from  <dig> e. coli strains which showed agglutination reactions with h <dig> antisera . eighty-six of the  <dig> strains showed hpaii and mboi restriction profiles which corresponded to the patterns obtained with strain u9- <dig>  . exceptions were made by strains p7d  and p12b  which showed individual restriction patterns which differed from all other h <dig> strains investigated in this study. .

cloning and expression of flic-h <dig> genes in the e. coli k- <dig> strain jm109
in order to study the functional expression of the flic-h <dig> genes in a different genetic background we cloned the corresponding pcr products of strains u9- <dig> and p12b into the vector plitmus <dig> as described in the methods section. the flic coding regions were inserted downstream of the lacz promoter of plitmus <dig> and the flic recombinant plasmids were transformed into the laboratory e. coli k- <dig> strain jm <dig>  <cit> . jm <dig> was serotyped as o-rough:h <dig>  and it showed the same hhai-rflp flic-pattern as the e. coli reference strain p <dig>   <cit>  . the functional expression of the cloned flic-h <dig> genes in the jm <dig> derivative strains tpe <dig>  and tpe <dig>  was analyzed by tube agglutination with h <dig> and h <dig> antisera, respectively. the strains tpe <dig> and tpe <dig> showed agglutination with h <dig> and h <dig> sera whereas the parental jm <dig> strain reacted only with h <dig> serum . to find out if the flagellins of the flic recombinant plasmid carrying jm <dig> strains were co-assembled in all flagella or assembled separately we studied the parental strain jm <dig> and its flic-h <dig> derivative tpe <dig> by iem . both strains were found to express 2- <dig> flagella per cell which appeared morphologically typical as long helical filaments  ,  <cit> . the reaction of h <dig> antiserum with bacteria followed by detection of adsorbed antibodies with anti-rabbit-igg coupled with  <dig> nm immuno-gold particles showed a specific and homogeneous labelling of flagella present on the surfaces of jm <dig>  and of tpe <dig> . when h <dig> serum was used, only flagella of strain tpe <dig> became immuno-labelled   and no labeling was observed with jm <dig> , confirming h-serotyping results. sequential double labeling experiments with h <dig> and h <dig> antibodies resulted in staining of all flagella on the surfaces of jm <dig>  and tpe <dig> . however, both  <dig> nm  and  <dig> nm  gold particles were only bound to flagella of tpe <dig>  whereas the flagella of jm <dig> were exclusively labelled with  <dig> nm gold particles which indicates the h <dig> antigen . these results demonstrate that both h <dig> and h <dig> flagellins are co-assembled in the flagella made by the flic-h48/h <dig> genes in strain tpe <dig> 

discussion
the flic genes of representative e. coli strains for the  <dig> different h-types were recently investigated and compared for their nucleotide sequences  <cit> . among the h-type reference strains which were not analyzed for their complete flic gene sequences, were the reference strains for the e. coli h <dig>  and h <dig>  flagellar antigen  <cit> . in this work, we performed a complete characterization of the flic-h <dig> genes from different e. coli strains with primers which were generated on the basis of the previously published flic sequence  of the e. coli h <dig> reference strain u9- <dig>  the comparison of the flic gene sequence encoding h <dig> flagella in strain p12b with the flic sequences of five other e. coli h <dig> or h <dig> strains revealed a high similarity on the dna and on the amino acid level . we established a pcr/rflp typing assay for genotypic investigation of clinical e. coli isolates which reacted with h <dig> antisera. genotyping of  <dig> e. coli strains comprising  <dig> different o-serogroups  revealed that  <dig> of the strains gave rflp patterns with hhai, mboi and hpaii which were indistiguishable from the prototype flic-h <dig> gene and only two strains showed alternative patterns. the detection of some genetic variants in the flic-h <dig> gene of e. coli strains studied here points to a sequence diversity similar as described previously for the flic genes of e. coli h <dig> and h <dig> strains  <cit> . these results correspond to previous findings indicating that the h <dig> antigens in different e. coli typing strains are not fully identical  <cit> .

it was suggested earlier that the strain p12b encodes two flagellins, h <dig> and h <dig>  which are subject to phase variation for their expression  <cit>  and mutants of p12b could be isolated which expressed only the h <dig> antigen  <cit> . recent studies have demonstrated that the flic gene of strain p12b encodes flagellar type h <dig> and it was suggested that the gene for the h <dig> flagellin is encoded by a locus outside flic, however the gene responsible for the flagellar type h <dig> was not identified in the study  <cit> . in our study, cultures of strain p12b were fully inhibited for motility and swarming in the presence of h <dig> antiserum but not in the presence of h <dig> antiserum which was used a non-specific control. this result indicates that h <dig> type flagella were not expressed or lost from our p12b isolate, similar as previously described with mutant strains of p12b  <cit> .

the functional expression of the cloned flic-h4u9-41and flic-h4p12b genes in the genetic background of e. coli k- <dig> strain jm <dig> which shows flagellar serotype h <dig> confirmed their coding capacity. since we found coexpression of cloned flagellins with the parental h <dig> flagellin, we became interested in the composition of flagella made by the flic recombinant plasmid carrying jm <dig> strains. electron microscopy of flagella from jm <dig> and from the flic-h4p12b recombinant plasmid carrying strain revealed no differences between jm <dig> and tpe <dig> showing both a typical helical organization of normal sized flagella on their surface . immuno-gold staining of bacteria which were prior incubated with h <dig> and h <dig> antisera revealed high specificity of the rabbit antisera for the flagellar structure . single  and double labelling  experiments with different sized gold markers demonstrated that all flagella present on the surface of tpe <dig> were labelled after incubation with h <dig> and h <dig> antiserum. our results indicate that both h <dig> and h <dig> flagellins are coassembled in the flagella made by the flic-h4p12b recombinant plasmid carrying strain. this finding is surprising in view of the molecular weight size differences found between h <dig> and h <dig> flagellin. to our knowledge, the assembling of two different flagellins in the same filament has not yet been demonstrated before. the h <dig> flagellin of e. coli k- <dig>  is a  <dig>  kda protein consisting of  <dig> amino acids and thus much larger than the  <dig>  kda h <dig> flagellin which is composed of  <dig> amino acids. however, both flagellins share conserved n- and c-terminal sequences which are known to be involved in the structural assembly of flagella  <cit> . h <dig> and h <dig> flagellins differ largely for their central regions which are not involved in flagellar assembly and function but which contain flagellar antigenic epitopes  <cit> .

we were able to show that the introduction of an isolated flic gene in e. coli can change the antigenic properties of the flagella made by this strain. horizontal transfer of flic genes may contribute to the diversity of flagellar serotypes by recombination within e. coli recipient strains. the mammalian host immune system is the driving force for continuous selection of new flagellar antigens in e. coli. published data indicate that both mutation and recombination events in the flic gene have taken place in the evolution of e. coli flagellar antigens  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our flic sequence data have shown that the flagellar type h <dig> which is present in e. coli strains of clinical importance covers several genetic variants which are closely related to each other. we have shown for the first time that flagellins of different molecular size are expressed and coassembled into functional flagella in a laboratory e. coli k- <dig> strain.
