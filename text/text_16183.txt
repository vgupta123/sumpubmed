BACKGROUND
programmed cell death, often referred to as apoptosis, is an evolutionarily conserved process that plays critical roles in normal animal development and tissue homeostasis; dysregulation of programmed cell death can cause disorders as diverse as cancer, autoimmune disease and retinal degeneration  <cit> . the genetic pathway that controls programmed cell death in c. elegans is known and evolutionarily conserved. both pro-death and pro-survival proteins are likely present in most if not all cells  <cit> . the decision of a cell to die is generally made at the level of the transcriptional control of the pro-apoptotic gene egl- <dig>  <cit> . when the egl- <dig> bh <dig> family protein is produced, it disrupts the cell-protective interaction between the anti-apoptotic ced- <dig> bcl-2-family protein and the ced- <dig> apaf-1-like protein, releasing ced- <dig> to activate the pro-apoptotic caspase ced- <dig> . these genes function cell-autonomously in cell death  <cit> , and c. elegans cell deaths have generally been considered to be suicides.

each dying cell is engulfed by a neighboring cell. in mutants deficient in the engulfment process, the vast majority of cells still undergo programmed cell death, but the cell corpses persist unengulfed and only slowly degrade . only a very small number of cells stochastically fail to die in engulfment-defective mutants  <cit> . thus, engulfment is not generally required for the death process. engulfment can promote the deaths of sensitized cells , possibly by preventing injured cells from recovering . by contrast, there is one cell death in c. elegans that has been speculated to be a murder, based on the observation that if the engulfing cell is killed using laser microsurgery, cell death can be prevented. specifically, the two left-right homologous cells b.alapaav and b.arapaav in the tail of the third-larval stage male constitute a developmental equivalence group  <cit> : either can survive , while the other undergoes programmed cell death and is engulfed by a neighboring cell, p <dig> pa  . this death occurs during the fourth larval stage  <cit> .fig.  <dig> b.alapaav and b.arapaav are left-right homologs and b.al/rapaav death is dependent on engulfment and suicide genes. a the b.alapaav and b.arapaav cell lineages. figure adapted from sulston et al.  <cit> . b b.alapaav and b.arapaav are located close to each other and to the engulfing cell p <dig> pa in the developing male tail. cell nuclei were traced from a dic image of an otherwise wild-type male of genotype nis343[p

two lines of evidence suggest that this programmed cell death is not a normal suicide. first, both b.alapaav and b.arapaav can survive in animals in which the engulfing cell p <dig> pa has been ablated with a laser microbeam  <cit> . second, b.al/rapaav death does not occur in mutants defective in the engulfment genes ced- <dig> or ced- <dig>  <cit> . we use “b.al/rapaav” to refer to the homolog that is fated to die , which can be either b.alapaav or b.arapaav. we use “the b.al/rapaav homolog” to refer to the homolog that is fated to survive. these observations suggested that b.al/rapaav death is dependent on p <dig> pa and that this death might be a murder mediated by the engulfment process. however, it was later observed that b.al/rapaav death also fails in mutants defective in the caspase ced- <dig>  leading to the suggestion that this death might be an induced suicide initiated by p <dig> pa engulfment or by another function of the engulfment genes  <cit> . we sought to characterize this unusual programmed cell death to further understand the interaction between the cell autonomously-acting cell-death genes and the cell non-autonomous process of engulfment.

RESULTS
b.al/rapaav death is caspase- and engulfment gene-dependent
to confirm and extend the observations that b.al/rapaav death is dependent on the engulfment genes ced- <dig> and ced- <dig>  <cit>  and the caspase ced- <dig>  <cit> , we assayed b.al/rapaav death in a variety of cell-death mutant backgrounds. specifically, we scored the presence of a cell that expressed a reporter specific for the dying b.al/rapaav, pegl-1::4xnls::gfp , in a position consistent with that of an undead b.al/rapaav in late fourth larval stage animals and interpreted such a cell as one that had failed to undergo programmed cell death. in this way, we confirmed that b.al/rapaav cell death is dependent on both the suicide and engulfment pathways. specifically, strong loss-of-function alleles of the pro-apoptotic genes egl- <dig>  ced- <dig> or ced- <dig> or a gain-of-function allele of the anti-apoptotic gene ced- <dig> almost completely blocked b.al/rapaav death . strong loss-of-function alleles of any of the major engulfment genes were also sufficient to prevent b.al/rapaav death . in two engulfment-defective animals that we observed into adulthood, the undead b.al/rapaav cell continued to persist for the duration of observation, indicating that engulfment defects prevent b.al/rapaav cell death rather than temporarily delaying it. while loss of engulfment gene function can weakly contribute to the survival of other cells in c. elegans, the effect is smaller than that of weak reduction-of-function mutations in suicide genes  <cit> . by contrast, weak reduction-of-function mutations in the pro-apoptotic genes ced- <dig> or ced- <dig> had smaller effects on b.al/rapaav survival than did loss of engulfment gene function . this finding indicates that b.al/rapaav death is particularly dependent on the function of engulfment genes rather than highly sensitive to any slight perturbation to the cell-death pathway. mutations in unc- <dig> rab <dig> cause severe defects in phagosome maturation and cell-corpse degradation after engulfment  <cit> , but a mutation in unc- <dig> did not significantly block b.al/rapaav death, suggesting that the engulfment process and not downstream degradation processes are important for b.al/rapaav death.

the dying b.al/rapaav expresses cell-death genes
the cell-death genes in c. elegans act cell-autonomously to specify and cause cell death  <cit> . to examine if the presumptive cell-death suicide genes indeed act in the dying b.al/rapaav, we used a transcriptional reporter for egl- <dig>  the most upstream gene in the core cell-death pathway; egl- <dig> is transcriptionally upregulated to drive programmed cell death  <cit> . the egl- <dig> reporter was expressed strongly in the b.al/rapaav cell fated to die and not at all or only weakly in the b.al/rapaav homolog, which is fated to live . all b.al/rapaav corpses in fourth larval stage wild-type animals were gfp-positive , confirming that the gfp expression is associated with the secondary fate of cell death.fig.  <dig> cell-death genes are expressed in b.al/rapaav. a gfp under the control of the egl- <dig> promoter is expressed brightly in b.al/rapaav in the tail of an early fourth larval stage “wild-type” male of genotype nis343; him- <dig>  scale bar:  <dig> μm. b the average intensity of pegl-1::4xnls::gfp in the nucleus is higher in the dying b.al/rapaav cell than in the surviving b.al/rapaav homolog in early fourth larval stage animals. the b.al/rapaav fate was assigned based on partial cytoplasmic refractility and/or nuclear position and distance from the midline of the animal. average fluorescent intensity within the nucleus was measured for confocal images of b.alapaav, b.arapaav and p <dig> pa in each animal, and the average background intensity was subtracted from each. a.u., arbitrary units. all genotypes include nis <dig>  and some also contain †: him-5; ‡: him-8; °: nis <dig>

we used single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization  to determine whether, like the pegl-1::4xnls::gfp reporter, endogenous cell-death genes are transcribed in the dying b.al/rapaav. we usually detected egl- <dig> mrna expression in b.al/rapaav and only rarely in the b.al/rapaav homolog, consistent with the expression pattern of pegl-1::4xnls::gfp . we detected low levels of ced- <dig> and ced- <dig> transcripts broadly . ced- <dig> transcripts were visible in only a subset of cells, usually including b.al/rapaav, and only rarely in the b.al/rapaav homolog . primary- and secondary-fated cells were identified based on nuclear position and morphology . because b.al/rapaav cell death is dependent on suicide genes that are expressed in the dying b.al/rapaav and not in nearby cells, b.al/rapaav death is likely a form of cell suicide rather than a murder.

engulfment genes do not induce the caspase-mediated suicide pathway
as in wild-type animals, pegl-1::4xnls::gfp was expressed in the undead secondary b.al/rapaav in cell-death suicide and engulfment mutants . similarly, endogenous transcripts of the cell-death genes egl- <dig> and ced- <dig> were generally present in one, but not both, of b.alapaav and b.arapaav in the engulfment-defective double mutant, ced- <dig> ced- <dig> . these data indicate that the induction of suicide gene expression in b.al/rapaav requires neither engulfment nor signals transduced via the engulfment pathway.fig.  <dig> b.al/rapaav and the b.al/rapaav homolog express pro-apoptotic genes differentially in cell-death mutants. all genotypes include nis <dig>  and some also contain †: him- <dig>  ‡: him- <dig>  °: nis <dig>  §: lon- <dig> dpy- <dig>  : lon- <dig>  ★: unc- <dig>

while mutations in either the suicide pathway or the engulfment pathway were sufficient to block b.al/rapaav from acquiring the highly refractile appearance characteristic of programmed cell death, we discovered that the morphology of b.al/rapaav as viewed with dic optics was different between these two classes of mutants: in the mid-fourth larval stage, b.al/rapaav was a highly-refractile corpse in most wild-type animals ; the undead b.al/rapaav in engulfment mutants generally was round with a refractile cytoplasm and non-refractile nucleus  and the undead b.al/rapaav in ced- <dig> and other suicide mutants generally was non-refractile, similar to other living cells, including the b.al/rapaav homolog . the morphology of the undead b.al/rapaav in engulfment mutants was indistinguishable from that of the dying b.al/rapaav at an earlier stage of the cell-death process. we interpret this morphology to be that of a cell in which caspases have been at least partially activated, as this morphology is dependent on ced- <dig> and the rest of the core cell-death pathway. these results further show that the engulfment genes are not required for the initiation of the cell-death process but are rather required in a later process. we examined unc- <dig> rab <dig> mutants, which are defective in phagosome maturation in the engulfing cell and hence in the degradation of cell corpses  <cit> . b.al/rapaav died and formed a fully refractile corpse in unc- <dig> mutants, suggesting that the failure of b.al/rapaav to form a fully refractile corpse in engulfment mutants is unlikely to be caused by a block in cell-corpse degradation.

in engulfment mutants the caspase pathway is activated, but b.al/rapaav death is not completed. the undead b.al/rapaav cell in engulfment mutants is similar to living cells and unlike other unengulfed cells fated to die, which form fully refractile corpses. like b.al/rapaav cells that have not yet died or undead b.al/rapaav cells in suicide-defective mutants, the undead b.al/rapaav cell in engulfment mutants was not fully refractile by dic optics, retained nuclear localization of pegl-1::4xnls::gfp and membrane localization of the cytoplasmic membrane marker pevl-20::mcherry::ph , and had diffuse chromatin as revealed by dapi staining ; by contrast, in fully-refractile b.al/rapaav corpses and other cell corpses in the male tail pegl-1::4xnls::gfp and pevl-20::mcherry::ph were distributed throughout the cell corpse, and chromatin after dapi staining appeared condensed . the distribution of pegl-1::4xnls::gfp throughout the cell corpse likely reflects nuclear disruption and/or inactivation of nuclear transport; nuclear disruption and chromatin condensation are two hallmarks of apoptotic cell death  <cit> . additionally, during time-course observations, we occasionally saw fluctuations in the level of b.al/rapaav cytoplasmic refractility in engulfment mutants, as was previously reported for other cells that had initiated but not completed the cell-death process  <cit> . these other cells sometimes survived and differentiated, establishing that cells with partial cytoplasmic refractility are not dead. similarly, b.al/rapaav is not dead, as it can return to a non-refractile morphology and lacks two canonical hallmarks of apoptotic dead cells, nuclear disruption and chromatin condensation. we conclude that ced- <dig> activity does not inevitably lead to the death of b.al/rapaav and that the b.al/rapaav cell fated to die in engulfment mutants is abnormal but alive.fig.  <dig> the undead b.al/rapaav cell in engulfment mutants fails to display characteristics of dead cells. a–c a living b.al/rapaav cell  in the early fourth larval stage before cell death is complete  lacks refractility in the nucleus,  has pegl-1::4xnls::gfp in the nucleus but not in the rest of the cell and  has pevl-20::mcherry::ph localized to the membrane. d–f a b.al/rapaav cell corpse has  refractility throughout the cell,  pegl-1::4xnls::gfp throughout the cell, and  pevl-20::mcherry::ph throughout the cell. g–i an undead b.al/rapaav cell in the late fourth larval stage of an engulfment-defective mutant  lacks refractility in the nucleus,  has pegl-1::4xnls::gfp in the nucleus but not the rest of the cell, and  has pevl-20::mcherry::ph localized to the membrane. j–l an undead b.al/rapaav cell in the late fourth larval stage of a suicide-defective mutant  lacks refractility,  has pegl-1::4xnls::gfp in the nucleus but not the rest of the cell, and  has pevl-20::mcherry::ph localized to the membrane. animals were of genotypes nis343; him- <dig> unc-76; nis349; nex <dig> , nis343; ced- <dig> him-8; nis <dig> , or nis343; ced- <dig> him-8; nis <dig> . scale bars:  <dig> μm. m a b.al/rapaav cell  in the early fourth larval stage has diffuse chromatin similar to neighboring living cells. n a dying or dead b.al/rapaav cell in the mid-fourth larval stage has condensed chromatin. o an undead b.al/rapaav cell in the late fourth larval stage of an engulfment-defective mutant has diffuse chromatin similar to neighboring living cells. p an undead b.al/rapaav cell in a suicide-defective mutant has diffuse chromatin similar to neighboring living cells. scale bars:  <dig> μm. animals were of the genotypes nis343; him-5; nis <dig> , ced- <dig> ced-1; nis343; him- <dig> , or nis343; ced- <dig> him- <dig> . a–l depict different animals than in , since the fixation required for visualizing dapi staining precludes the use of dic optics



the engulfing cell p <dig> pa is not required for the b.al/rapaav death
it has been reported that the engulfing cell p <dig> pa is required for b.al/rapaav cell death  <cit> . to examine the role of p <dig> pa in b.al/rapaav cell death, we ablated p <dig> pa or its precursor p <dig> p early in development, about 15– <dig> hours prior to the generation of b.alapaav and b.arapaav, and looked for signs that b.al/rapaav had initiated the cell-death program. in the absence of p <dig> pa, b.alapaav and b.arapaav adopted normal primary and secondary fates and one initiated the cell-death process, as evidenced by egl- <dig> reporter gene expression and by the positions and morphologies of the two cells . thus, p <dig> pa is not required for b.alapaav and b.arapaav to differentially adopt the primary and secondary fates or to initiate the death process in the secondary b.al/rapaav.fig.  <dig> p <dig> pa ablation does not prevent initiation of b.al/rapaav death. a percentages of p <dig> pa-ablated and mock-ablated males that have cytoplasmic refractility in b.al/rapaav, p

to our surprise, we found that b.al/rapaav died in many of the animals that lacked p <dig> pa , contrary to the previous report  <cit> . thus, although b.al/rapaav death is almost completely dependent on engulfment genes, it is only partially dependent on the presence of the normal engulfing cell. to reconcile this difference, we postulated that other cells might engulf b.al/rapaav in the absence of p <dig> pa. we designed a reporter protein with mcherry fused to the pleckstrin homology domain, which binds to lipids in the plasma membrane  <cit> , and expressed this construct  using a promoter from the evl- <dig> gene  <cit> , which is widely expressed throughout the animal, including in p <dig> pa, b.alapaav and b.arapaav . this construct highlights cell membranes and allowed us to visually determine if a corpse is internalized by another cell. we ablated p <dig> pa in this strain and found again that b.al/rapaav died in many of the animals. in animals in which b.al/rapaav survived, the undead b.al/rapaav was not engulfed . b.al/rapaav died in  <dig> p <dig> pa-ablated animals, and in  <dig> of these  <dig> cases the b.al/rapaav corpse was engulfed by a neighboring cell . we conclude that the discrepancy between the essentially complete dependence on engulfment genes and the weaker dependence on the engulfing cell p <dig> pa is a consequence of the compensatory ability of other cells to engulf b.al/rapaav in the absence of p <dig> pa.

in nine of the  <dig> animals, the engulfing cell was the surviving primary b.al/rapaav homolog, and in five animals it was a more lateral cell. the identities of the other engulfing cells are uncertain. based on position, likely candidates are k.a or the left rectal gland cell, b.alapaad and f.lvv. the b.al/rapaav homolog, k.a, the rectal gland cells, b.al/rapaad and f.l/rvv are cells that do not normally engulf corpses, since the only nearby dying cell is b.al/rapaav, which is engulfed by p <dig> pa. these findings demonstrate that other cells are competent to engulf b.al/rapaav in the absence of p <dig> pa and that even cells that do not normally engulf cell corpses can have a cryptic ability to recognize and engulf dying cells to promote cell death.

in short, b.al/rapaav likely becomes fated to die and begins to die cell-autonomously but generally requires engulfment by p <dig> pa or another neighboring cell to fully execute the death process. the death of b.al/rapaav thus does not seem to be an induced suicide, the process proposed by reddien et al.  <cit> .

engulfment by p <dig> pa precedes the b.al/rapaav death
if engulfment is required for the b.al/rapaav death, b.al/rapaav might be engulfed early in the cell-death process, before it becomes a fully refractile corpse. to test this hypothesis, we imaged b.al/rapaav in fourth larval stage animals with cell membranes labeled by pevl-20::mcherry::ph. we characterized the morphology of each b.al/rapaav as either non-refractile, round with cytoplasmic refractility  or fully refractile . then, we imaged pevl-20::mcherry::ph to determine the boundaries of b.al/rapaav and p <dig> pa. we found that b.al/rapaav corpses were always  internalized by p <dig> pa, cell-death initiated cells were usually  internalized by p <dig> pa, and cells with no sign of cell death initiation were never  internalized . these data indicate that p <dig> pa engulfs b.al/rapaav in the early stages of its death, but probably not before the cell death has already been initiated . these findings are consistent with our observations that the suicide pathway acts before the engulfment pathway. we also confirmed that the identity of the engulfing cell was always p <dig> pa in intact animals : other cells engulf b.al/rapaav only if p <dig> pa is absent.fig.  <dig> engulfment precedes the b.al/rapaav death. a all non-refractile b.al/rapaav cells are unengulfed, most cells that are round with partial cytoplasmic refractility are engulfed by p <dig> pa and all fully refractile cells are engulfed by p <dig> pa. representative dic and fluorescent images corresponding to each of the b.al/rapaav morphology classes are shown, with the p <dig> pa  and b.al/rapaav cell membranes  outlined . all animals were in the fourth larval stage, but were at slightly different ages for visualization of b.al/rapaav at different stages of the death process. b, c a b.arapaav cell with partial cytoplasmic refractility  visualized by  dic and  electron microscopy . c the b.arapaav cell is engulfed by p <dig> pa  but otherwise does not display obvious ultrastructural signs of cell death. the animal was of genotype him- <dig> 
d b.al/rapaav does not die in a weak engulfment mutant without being engulfed. engulfment and cell-killing are not independent events . b.al/rapaav was classified as being dead or undead based on morphology as seen with dic optics and was then examined to determine whether it was inside of p <dig> pa based on pevl-20::mcherry::ph. animals were of the genotype nis343; ced- <dig> him-8; nis735




we confirmed that engulfment can precede the completion of cell death using electron microscopy. we observed a dying b.arapaav cell using dic microscopy and fixed and stained the animal at the stage at which the b.arapaav cell was round with cytoplasmic refractility . b.arapaav had already been internalized by p <dig> pa but, ultrastructurally, it lacked signs of cell death such as nuclear envelope dilation or crenulation, extensive chromatin condensation, and membrane whorling   <cit> .

it is conceivable that engulfment genes act to promote b.al/rapaav cell death by cell-killing activities independent of their roles in engulfment per se. the weak loss-of-function allele ced- <dig> stochastically prevents b.al/rapaav cell death in only some animals . we hypothesized that if ced- <dig> promoted b.al/rapaav death through a cell-killing activity independent of its role in engulfment, these two functions might stochastically fail in different animals. for example, b.al/rapaav might be killed without being engulfed or engulfed without being killed. however, if the cell-killing activity of ced- <dig> were mediated through engulfment, b.al/rapaav would not be killed unless it were engulfed. we found that b.al/rapaav corpses in ced- <dig> were always engulfed by p <dig> pa . undead b.al/rapaav cells were sometimes unengulfed and sometimes engulfed. these data are inconsistent with the hypothesis that engulfment and cell-killing are independent events . we conclude that engulfment precedes b.al/rapaav death and that the killing activity of ced- <dig> is mediated through its engulfment function.

like most other cell deaths in c. elegans, b.al/rapaav death requires the canonical suicide genes, with these genes being expressed in the cell that dies. thus, the suicide pathway is activated in b.al/rapaav. however, while such activation is sufficient to kill most cells , it is insufficient to kill b.al/rapaav, which appears injured but intact without engulfment. thus, engulfment is dispensable for other cell deaths but is required for the b.al/rapaav death. this death is unlikely to be a murder , as it requires suicide genes, or an induced suicide , as neither the engulfing cell p <dig> pa nor the engulfment genes are required for the initiation of the cell-death process. we conclude that b.al/rapaav death is instead an assisted suicide , since engulfment occurs early in the b.al/rapaav death process and is necessary to facilitate the suicide process and cause cell death.fig.  <dig> models of alternative modes of b.al/rapaav cell death. a suicide: b.al/rapaav initiates the suicide program and undergoes programmed cell death, resulting in a fully-refractile corpse, which is engulfed by the neighboring cell p <dig> pa. a suicide cell death would occur in engulfment mutants and in p <dig> pa-ablated animals but not in suicide-pathway mutants. our data are inconsistent with this model, as the death does not occur in engulfment mutants. b murder: b.al/rapaav is healthy until it is engulfed by p <dig> pa, after which it dies. this form of cell death would occur in suicide-pathway mutants but not in engulfment mutants or p <dig> pa-ablated animals . our data are inconsistent with this model, as the death does not occur in suicide mutants. c induced suicide: b.al/rapaav is signaled by p <dig> pa to induce the suicide program. this form of cell death would not occur in suicide-pathway mutants or p <dig> pa-ablated animals but would occur in engulfment mutants . our data are inconsistent with this model, as initiation of the b.al/rapaav death process is not dependent on the presence of p <dig> pa or the activities of the engulfment genes . d assisted suicide: b.al/rapaav initiates the suicide program, which is ineffective at causing programmed cell death and results in a suicide-stalled cell. once b.al/rapaav is engulfed, the death reaches completion. this form of cell death would not occur in suicide mutants, engulfment mutants, or p <dig> pa-ablated animals . the suicide-stalled cell in an engulfment mutant might show signs of cell-death initiation. our data are consistent with this model



are there other assisted suicides? cell deaths in c. elegans exist along a spectrum of sensitivities to engulfment. for example, in the anterior pharynx, postdeirid and ventral cord, cells that are fated to die survive only 0– <dig> % of the time in a ced- <dig> engulfment mutant  <cit> , making b.al/rapaav, which survives  <dig> % of the time , a clear outlier. b.al/rapaav death is the only death in c. elegans known to be strikingly dependent on engulfment. however, comprehensive studies have not been performed. b.al/rapaav death was identified as possibly engulfment-dependent and further studied in engulfment mutants based on its major dependence on the engulfing cell p <dig> pa  <cit> . b.al/rapaav is always engulfed by p <dig> pa in intact animals. by contrast, hoeppner et al.  <cit>  found that, for nine of  <dig> embryonic cell deaths studied, the identity of the engulfing cell varied among animals. additionally, our studies of b.al/rapaav have shown that cells that do not normally display engulfment activity can have cryptic engulfment ability and engulf the dying cell if the normal engulfing cell is absent. in such cases, ablation of an engulfing cell would not prevent cell death, since a secondary engulfing cell would assume the engulfment function. more comprehensive analysis using engulfment-defective mutants rather than laser-ablation experiments could reveal more instances of assisted suicide in c. elegans.

how might engulfment promote the death process? it has recently been reported that engulfment genes promote the death of the sister cell of the c. elegans nsm neuron by affecting its precursor cell  <cit> . specifically, in the precursor cell that generates the nsm neuron and its sister cell, which dies, there is a higher level of ced- <dig> activity in the region that will form the dying nsm sister; the engulfment genes ced- <dig> and ced- <dig> are required for the formation of this gradient, suggesting that engulfment can promote the cell-death process at least in part by causing cells to differentially inherit apoptotic potential. this mechanism is unlikely to be the way in which engulfment causes the b.al/rapaav death. first, the situation is inherently different: b.alapaav and b.arapaav are not sister cells, and at the time of their generation neither is committed to dying  <cit> . thus, even if b.alapaav and b.arapaav inherit more pro-apoptotic potential than their sister cells, that potential is not sufficient to cause cell death. second, engulfment genes are not required for the difference in levels of apoptotic activity in b.al/rapaav and the b.al/rapaav homolog: we have shown that the dying cell b.al/rapaav up-regulates cell-death genes and displays morphological changes characteristic of cell-death initiation while the surviving b.al/rapaav homolog does not do so, and neither of these differences is engulfment-dependent.

engulfment- or phagocyte-dependent cell deaths have been described in other organisms. for example, phagoptosis of stressed-but-viable neurons in mammals  <cit>  and entosis of weaker-but-viable cells in tumors  <cit>  are engulfment-dependent mechanisms of cell killing. tumor cells can evade phagocytosis by upregulating the “don’t eat me” signal cd <dig>  and this evasion can be abrogated with anti-cd <dig> antibodies, which allow tumor cells to be engulfed and killed  <cit> . however, these deaths appear to be caspase-independent murders rather than caspase-dependent assisted suicides. it was reported that both engulfment and caspase genes are necessary for cell competition in drosophila, a phenomenon in which fitter cells can outcompete and cause the death of neighboring less fit cells  <cit> , but more recent studies suggest that these deaths might not be engulfment-dependent  <cit> . purkinje cells in slices of the mouse cerebellar cortex show signs of apoptosis  that is dependent on microglia, which are engulfing cells  <cit> . however, it is unclear if engulfment is involved or if the microglia act to induce cell suicide by releasing reactive oxygen species. suicides induced by microglia have been observed in other cases  <cit> .

do assisted suicides exist in other species? it might be difficult to identify such assisted suicides, since suicide-initiated, stalled cells in c. elegans engulfment mutants appear morphologically similar to normal cell suicides in progress. in c. elegans it is possible to identify stalled cells as failed deaths because it is known when and where all cell deaths normally occur. it is likely that findings from future studies of assisted suicide in c. elegans will provide insights into the cell non-autonomous factors involved in engulfment-dependent deaths of other species. better understanding of assisted suicides in c. elegans could also lead to the identification and study of assisted suicides in other organisms. given that engulfment-mediated cell deaths likely act in the progression of various human diseases, such as the loss of neurons by phagoptosis in neurodegenerative disorders  <cit>  and the removal of cancer cells through engulfment or entosis  <cit> , further studies of assisted suicides might provide insights of medical importance.

why does b.al/rapaav require assistance by an engulfing cell to die? b.al/rapaav is able to express egl- <dig> and the caspase ced- <dig> without dying; these processes are necessary but insufficient for the b.al/rapaav death. weak mutations in ced- <dig> or ced- <dig> allow other cells to survive only rarely  <cit> , but allow b.al/rapaav to survive most of the time . these results suggest that b.al/rapaav is hard to kill and generally resistant to activation of the cell-death suicide pathway, which may be why assistance from an engulfing cell is needed. we believe that ced- <dig> is activated in the dying b.al/rapaav based on the morphological changes that occur in a caspase-dependent but engulfment-independent manner, but we do not know the level of active ced- <dig> in b.al/rapaav. translational and post-translational effectors have been shown to regulate cell death in c. elegans, so the level of ced- <dig> transcript does not necessarily correspond to the level of activated ced- <dig>  <cit> . it is possible that b.al/rapaav has lower levels of activated ced- <dig> than most dying cells or that b.al/rapaav might require more activated ced- <dig> to die than most dying cells, and that this difference causes b.al/rapaav death to require assistance. tumor cells can be more sensitive than non-tumor cells to treatments that induce apoptosis such as radiation and chemotherapy  <cit> . we suggest that understanding the mechanistic basis of the difference in sensitivity between b.al/rapaav and other cells that undergo apoptosis during c. elegans development might reveal aspects of cancer biology.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate that the b.al/rapaav programmed cell death is dependent on both the core apoptotic pathway and the engulfment pathway. initiation of the cell-death process requires the core apoptotic pathway, but death does not occur unless b.al/rapaav is engulfed. thus, this death represents a novel form of cell death, which we term “assisted suicide.” this form of cell death might occur in other organisms. further studies of how engulfment can promote cell death and what makes a cell require non-cell autonomous assistance during the cell-death process will likely reveal findings important for cancer biology and medicine.
