BACKGROUND
annexin v, formerly known as human placental anticoagulation protein, is a member of a family of calcium-dependent phospholipid binding proteins  <cit>  that binds preferentially to phosphatidylserine , a negatively charged phospholipid highly enriched in the inner leaflet of plasma membranes  <cit> . annexin v shows minimal capacity to bind phospholipids that are constitutively present in the outer leaflet of plasma membranes, such as phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin  <cit> . during the early stages of apoptosis, cells expose ps on the surface, which is specifically recognized by phagocytic cells  <cit> . the exposed ps residues can be bound selectively by annexin v with nanomolar to picomolar affinity  <cit> . because of the role of apoptosis in the pathophysiology of many diseases, there is a wide range of current and potentially new applications for annexin v as an apoptotic marker in clinical diagnosis  <cit> . staining cells simultaneously with annexin v labeled with the fluorochrome fluorescein isothiocyanate  and the non-vital dye propidium iodide  allows the discrimination among intact cells  early apoptotic cells  and late apoptotic or necrotic cells   <cit> . moreover, recombinant human annexin v  serves as an important in vivo diagnostic tool when labeled with different radionuclides, such as iodine- <dig>  and the metastable isotope technetium- <dig>  providing a broad range of imaging applications in apoptosis research, as single-photon emission computed tomography and auto-radiography to positron emission tomography  <cit> . in nuclear medicine, annexin v radiolabeled with 99mtc or 123i is used to evaluate the efficacy of cancer therapy and disease progression or regression  <cit> .

because of its widespread use as a diagnostic tool, rhanxa <dig> is commercially produced in microorganisms such as escherichia coli using recombinant dna techniques  <cit> . to produce rhanxa <dig> in large scale in this study, we used e. coli, the most commonly used host for recombinant protein production  <cit> . in shake flask cultures, all components are added at the start of the cultivation, without the need to monitor or control any parameter such as ph or the level of dissolved oxygen, leading to slow growth and low recombinant protein production  <cit> . high cell-density culture techniques have been developed to improve productivity and to provide advantages such as reduced culture volume, enhanced downstream processing, reduced wastewater, lower production costs and reduced investment in equipment  <cit> . fed-batch cultivation is an effective and simple method  <cit> , allowing substantial concentrations of glucose, an inexpensive and readily usable carbon and energy source  <cit> . to our knowledge, there is currently no protocol available for a bioreactor-based, large-scale production of rhanxa <dig> 

in this work, we describe a procedure for the production of  <dig>  mg of homogeneous, nontagged rhanxa <dig> from 3 g wet weight of bacterial cells from bioreactor cultures. the identity and absence of host contaminants in purified rhanxa <dig> was confirmed by lc-ms/ms peptide mapping experiments. the molecular mass determination of intact rhanxa <dig> confirmed the integrity of the purified protein. additionally, the produced rhanxa <dig> protein was shown to be functional in a bioassay for in vitro apoptosis/necrosis detection, in which it performed similarly to a commercially available kit.

RESULTS
cloning and expression of rhanxa5
the gene encoding human annexin v, anxa <dig>  is located on human chromosome 4q <dig> locus and spans a region of dna 29 kb in length containing  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns. anxa <dig> encodes a  <dig>  kda protein of  <dig> amino acid residues in length which is translated from a single mature transcript of approximately  <dig>  kb  <cit> . the human anxa <dig> coding sequence was subcloned into the pet-30a  expression vector to generate the recombinant pet-30a ::anxa <dig> plasmid. both the sequence and the absence of pcr-introduced mutations in the anxa <dig> coding sequence were confirmed by automated sequencing.

the bl <dig>  and c <dig>  e. coli strains were transformed with the pet-30a ::anxa <dig> construct by electroporation. the expression profiles were tested in lysogeny broth  and in our semi-defined  medium. the best results of soluble recombinant protein production from shaker cultivation were obtained using the bl <dig>  strain in sd medium induced with 1 mm iptg at 37°c .

bioreactor cultivation
the best growth conditions found in shaker cultivations were applied to the bioreactor batch and fed-batch cultures. we employed our sd medium and a temperature of 37°c in all experiments.

transformed bl <dig>  e. coli was grown from a master cell bank  under batch cultivation in 1 l of sd medium at 37°c monitoring glucose consumption. within 4 h, glucose was depleted from media, indicating this was the right time to start feeding. we compared do-stat, ph-stat and linear ascending feeding strategies in uninduced cultures. a biomass concentration of  <dig>  g  l− <dig> was attained in an uninduced culture using the linear ascending feeding profile  <cit> . lower values for biomass concentration were obtained using do-stat  l−1) or ph-stat  l−1) feeding strategies. therefore, we selected the linear ascending feeding strategy for further fed-batch cultivations.

after 4 h of batch cultivation without feeding, the biomass concentration reached  <dig>  g  l− <dig> . we induced rhanxa <dig> expression in fed-batch cultivations with linear ascending feeding by adding iptg to a final concentration of 1 mm. from three independent fermentations, we obtained a mean value of  <dig>  g  l− <dig>  for the biomass concentration and a total protein content of  <dig>  g l− <dig> . in contrast, we obtained a biomass concentration of  <dig>  g  l− <dig> in shaker cultivation  after 6 h of culture. this represents a 45-fold increase in biomass concentration.

in an independent bioreactor cultivation, we performed densitometric analysis of culture samples  to calculate the product yield  l−1), the productivity  l−1 h−1) and the specific yield  g −1). rhanxa <dig> corresponded to  <dig> %  of the total protein content  . therefore, we obtained a product yield of  <dig>  g  l− <dig> of culture medium, a specific yield of  <dig>  g  g − <dig> and a productivity of  <dig>  g  l−1 h− <dig>  considering the entire fermentation period .

moreover, we can consider the entire procedure, from bioreactor cultivation to protein purification, and calculate the yield and productivity of homogeneous rhanxa <dig>  from four independent purifications, we obtained a mean value of  <dig>  mg of purified rhanxa <dig> from 3 g wet weight of cells . in terms of volumetric yield, we obtained   <dig>  g  l− <dig> . the productivity over the entire fermentation  was  <dig>  g  l−1 h− <dig> .

purification
the overexpressed protein was purified by a single-step protocol consisting of a strong anion-exchange column . figure  <dig> shows the steps of rhanxa <dig> purification. the target protein eluted at approximately 190 mm of nacl from a monoq hr 16/ <dig> column . the eluted protein was pooled and dialyzed against hepes 100 mm nacl ph  <dig> , concentrated using an amicon ultra-filtration membrane and stored at −80°c in 1 ml aliquots. this purification protocol yielded  <dig>  mg of purified rhanxa <dig> from 3 g wet weight of cells .

rhanxa <dig> identification by mass spectrometry
homogeneous rhanxa <dig> samples were desalted and digested with trypsin, and the peptide mixtures were analyzed in lc-ms/ms peptide mapping experiments. a total of  <dig> spectra were identified with  <dig> different peptides derived from rhanxa <dig> protein. these peptides covered 80% of the rhanxa <dig> sequence.

determination of rhanxa <dig> molecular mass
the spectra of intact rhanxa <dig> samples were recorded with a linear ion trap analyzer. peaks spanning charge states 18+ to 39+ were detected  and the spectra deconvoluted. we obtained a value of  <dig>  da for the average molecular mass of rhanxa <dig> , consistent with the post-translational removal of the n-terminal methionine .

fitc-annexin v binding test
to test the functional activity of purified rhanxa <dig>  we assayed its ability to detect cells undergoing apoptosis. we treated b16f <dig> cells with cisplatin to induce apoptosis and after  <dig> or 12 h, we stained treated cells simultaneously with the non-vital dye pi and with rhanxa <dig> labeled with the fluorochrome fitc. double staining allows the discrimination between intact cells , early apoptotic cells  and late apoptotic or necrotic cells   <cit> . the ability of fitc-labeled rhanxa <dig> to detect apoptotic cells was compared with a commercial kit from bd. we performed dose curve experiments with different concentrations of cisplatin and stained treated cells for 6 h  or 12 h  after treatment. we obtained similar results using our homemade kit  or the commercial kit at different times after treatment  and concentrations of cisplatin , indicating that purified rhanxa <dig> is functionally active. dot plot representations of flow cytometry experiments with cells stained 12 h after treatment clearly show differences in the distribution of fitc/pi cell populations between untreated cells , cells treated with 40 μg/ml and cells treated with 160 μg/ml of cisplatin .

CONCLUSIONS
fed-batch cultivations represent an alternative to shaker cultivations, allowing control of process variables and improvement on biomass concentration and product yields  <cit> . a chimeric protein containing the c-terminus of hirudin fused to annexin v was previously expressed in large scale using fed-batch fermentation  <cit> . however, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a scale up of rhanxa <dig> production.

recombinant protein production methods must continuously be improved to meet commercial demands  <cit> . in this work, we produced  <dig>  mg of purified recombinant human annexin v from 3 g wet weight of cells  obtained in fed-batch cultures induced with iptg. moreover, this protocol generated a yield of homogeneous rhanxa <dig>  of  <dig>  g  l− <dig> . the productivity over the entire fermentation  was  <dig>  g  l−1 h− <dig> .

rhanxa <dig> could be commercially distributed to several research groups and to radiopharmaceutical companies. the use of fluorescence-labeled annexin v to identify apoptotic cells is currently limited to histologic and cell-sorting studies performed in vitro. its use for in vivo imaging studies is hampered mainly by cost issues. hence, production in large scale may expand the commercial utilities for rhanxa <dig>  reducing costs and allowing a greater access of the scientific and physician community to this product.
