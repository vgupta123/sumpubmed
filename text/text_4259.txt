BACKGROUND
neural networks are shaped through the formation, stabilization and elimination of synapses that connect neurons with their targets. the neuromuscular junction , a model synapse in the peripheral nervous system, forms by the contact of motor neurons and muscle fibers. these interactions lead to a polyinnervated synapse at birth, in which acetylcholine receptors  are clustered in a flat, plaque-like postsynaptic membrane. in a postnatal phase of elimination, nmjs mature and achrs become stabilized at the crests of postjunctional folds to form pretzel-shaped areas, while all but one axon withdraw in a process in which adjacent achrs are destabilized  <cit> . mechanisms of stabilization of achr clusters are thus important for proper postnatal maturation of the nmj, which ultimately will allow for correct nerve-evoked muscle contractibility.

the molecular processes that first form nmjs are well known. neural agrin, by activating the kinase musk, plays a crucial role by triggering downstream signaling pathways that cause clustering and tyrosine phosphorylation of achrs, as reviewed recently  <cit> . neural activity dissolves receptor clusters that are not protected by local agrin deposition in the basal lamina, thereby shaping the postsynaptic architecture  <cit> . in cultured myotubes, a short pulse of agrin leads to long-lasting musk phosphorylation and normal achr clustering much later, implying that, once activated, a balance of downstream protein tyrosine kinases  and protein tyrosine phosphatases  keeps postsynaptic clustering mechanisms activated  <cit> .

much less is known about the molecular pathways that mature nmjs postnatally and stabilize adult pretzel-shaped achr clusters. although musk is involved  <cit> , these pathways differ from those in nmj induction  <cit> . stability of achr clusters can be modeled in cultured myotubes, by adding and then removing agrin, and studying cluster dispersal in the withdrawal phase. despite the difference in time scale, this method reveals many parallels to postnatal stabilization of the nmj in vivo, which can be assessed by electroporating interfering constructs into mouse soleus muscle  <cit> . thus, the protein complex associated with utrophin including the components dystroglycan and dystrobrevin, and src-family kinases , stabilize the postsynapse and achr clusters both in vivo and in cultured myotubes in vitro  <cit> . sfks are activated by agrin  <cit> , interact with achrs  <cit> , and maintain achr β subunit phosphorylation and interaction of the receptor with its anchoring protein rapsyn  <cit> . in cultured src-/-;fyn-/- myotubes, agrin or laminin induce normal achr clustering, but the clusters dissemble rapidly within a few hours after withdrawal of these factors  <cit> . sfks act in a dual mechanism with cholesterol-rich lipid microdomains related to lipid rafts, as sfks promote normal microdomain assembly, while the microdomains allow sfks to act upon postsynaptic proteins  <cit> . in vivo, interfering with sfk function causes postsynaptic disintegration of adult nmjs. interestingly, decreasing or increasing sfk activity through expression of dominant-negative  or constitutively active src both cause disassembly of achrs aggregates in vivo  <cit> . this raises the possibility that balanced sfk activity is important for postsynaptic stability and suggests that ptps may be involved in stabilization of achr clusters as well. one ptp known to be enriched at the nmj is the non-receptor phosphatase shp- <dig>  <cit> . shp- <dig> can modulate agrin/musk signaling and neuregulin-regulated achr transcription  <cit> , making it a good candidate for postsynaptic signaling processes.

we have therefore analyzed the role of ptps, especially shp- <dig>  in the stabilization of achr clusters, and their interplay with sfks. we find that phosphatases such as shp- <dig> stabilize achr clusters after withdrawal of agrin from cultured myotubes. shp- <dig> is also necessary to stabilize adult achr pretzels at nmjs in mouse soleus muscle in vivo. interestingly, in src-/-;fyn-/- myotubes shp- <dig> is overexpressed, and blocking ptp activity restores achr cluster stability completely, showing that a fine balance of ptps with sfks is crucial for maintaining achr clusters.

RESULTS
ptp inhibition by pervanadate reduces the stability of agrin-induced achr clusters
to address the role of the activity of ptps in the stabilization of agrin-induced achr clusters, we made use of the potent ptp inhibitor sodium pervanadate  <cit>  and cultured c2c <dig> myotubes, in which achrs were visualized by treatment with fluorescent α-bungarotoxin . ptp inhibition did not lead to any change in the number of spontaneous achr clusters observed per field when compared to the untreated control . the stability of achr clusters can be modeled in cell culture by incubating c2c <dig> myotubes with agrin to induce maximal clustering, followed by agrin withdrawal, washing the cells, incubating them in agrin-free medium for a number of hours, and counting clusters at the end of this withdrawal period  <cit> . when pervanadate was added at the time of agrin withdrawal, significantly less achr clusters were observed after a  <dig> h withdrawal period than in controls lacking pervanadate . these data show that block of ptp activity enhances the disintegration of pre-existing agrin-induced achr clusters and that therefore, ptps are required to stabilize clusters of achrs. this is a specific process operating in cells that were previously exposed to agrin, since block of ptp activity as such does not alter the level of spontaneous achr clustering.

a balance of ptp and sfk activities stabilizes achr clusters: the instability of achr clusters in the absence of sfks is rescued by pervanadate treatment
sfks are key in stabilizing achr clusters in vivo and in cultured myotubes in vitro  <cit> . in src-/-;fyn-/- myotubes, agrin induces normal achr clustering, but the clusters disassemble rapidly within few hours upon agrin withdrawal  <cit> . we analyzed whether under these circumstances ptps may also influence the stability of achr clusters. for this purpose we treated src-/-;fyn-/- myotubes with agrin to induce maximal clustering, then withdrew agrin and added pervanadate at the same time, for a withdrawal period of  <dig> h. this pervanadate treatment prevented achr clusters from disappearing, such that clusters remained completely stable during the withdrawal period . in sharp contrast, omitting pervanadate led to disassembly of the agrin-induced clusters down to spontaneous levels . thus, block of ptp activity causes stabilization of achr clusters in the absence of src and fyn. this is a specific process that only affects pre-existing agrin-induced clusters, because pervanadate treatment alone did not alter the levels of spontaneous clusters . moreover, when added together with agrin, pervanadate did not affect the extent of agrin-induced achr clustering .

src and fyn are not the only members of this family of kinases present in myotubes. a third member of the sfks, yes, is present in muscle and upregulated in src-/-;fyn-/- myotubes  <cit> . this led us to investigate whether the observed destabilizing effect of ptps was solely due to the absence of src and fyn, or whether this effect would also occur when all members of the sfks in muscle were blocked. we therefore made use of the specific inhibitor pp <dig> to block sfks in c2c <dig> myotubes  <cit> . we again induced achr clustering by agrin and then removed agrin to analyze the effect on the stability of these achr clusters. we found that when added together with agrin, pp <dig> had no effect on the level of clustering induced by agrin , as has been previously observed  <cit> . however, upon removal of agrin, blocking sfks with pp <dig> led to a two-fold decrease in the number of remaining achr clusters, almost down to spontaneous levels . this instability was completely prevented when ptps were inhibited with pervanadate in the withdrawal phase . these data confirm those from src-/-;fyn-/- myotubes and show, firstly, that sfk activity maintains the stability of achr clusters in cultured wild-type myotubes, similar to recent findings in muscle in vivo  <cit> . secondly, ptps destabilize achr clusters in the absence of sfk activity and could indeed be the key destabilizing factor for agrin-induced achr clusters in the absence of sfks. taken together, these data show that the stability of agrin-induced achr clusters following the withdrawal of agrin requires a fine balance between the kinase activities of sfks and the phosphatase activities of ptps.

protein tyrosine phosphatase shp- <dig> increasingly associates with musk upon agrin stimulation
we wanted to identify possible ptps that play a role in stabilization of achr clusters. an example of how the activity of a ptp is required in positively controlling the actions of a kinase is the regulation of src activity by the sh <dig> domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase shp- <dig>  <cit> . shp- <dig> is enriched at neuromuscular synapses and colocalizes with achrs in vivo  <cit> . in cultured myotubes, shp- <dig> is a major ptp and can control the phosphorylation level of musk and the extent of agrin-induced achr clustering  <cit> . shp- <dig> is therefore a likely candidate ptp for playing roles in the stabilization process of achr clusters.

we first determined whether shp- <dig> is in a position to affect cluster stabilization by testing its association with musk. we treated c2c <dig> myotubes with agrin to induce musk phosphorylation, following which we immunoprecipitated musk and probed for both musk and shp- <dig>  we found that shp- <dig> is co-immunoprecipitated together with musk, also without agrin treatment, and that the association between the two proteins increases  <dig> -fold following musk phosphorylation by agrin .

since shp- <dig> is known to colocalize with achrs and hence presumably also with musk at nmjs  <cit> , we investigated this association between musk and shp- <dig> further using a heterologous cell system. we transfected cos cells with myc-tagged musk and flag-tagged shp- <dig> constructs, and visualized musk and shp- <dig> in the transfected cells by immunocytochemistry. as expected, being a ubiquitously-expressed non-receptor ptp, shp- <dig> was localized throughout the whole of the cell, but also along membrane ruffles on the plasma membrane . on the other hand, musk showed more of a membrane localization, characteristic for a receptor tyrosine kinase . shp- <dig> and musk colocalized within these membrane ruffles present along the plasma membrane . they however did not cause the relocalization of one another, since singly-transfected cos cells also exhibited similar distribution patterns of the expressed proteins .

from these results we can conclude that musk and shp- <dig> colocalize in ruffles along the plasma membrane. they also associate with one another, and shp- <dig> increases its association to musk upon musk activation by agrin, perhaps through an interaction of the sh <dig> domains in shp- <dig> with musk phosphorylation sites. the association with musk highlights that shp- <dig> is in a position to affect achr cluster stability.

knockdown of shp- <dig> in myotubes by vector-driven shrna specifically reduces shp- <dig> protein levels
to address the role of shp- <dig> in stabilization of achr clusters, we used a knockdown approach by rna interference . we cloned three short-hairpin rna  loops into the psuper.gfp vector and tested their efficacy in downregulating shp- <dig> expression in c2c <dig> myotubes. we used shrna loops generated against different regions of the murine shp- <dig> open-reading frame , based on already published and successfully used sirna or shrna sequences  <cit> . these constructs co-expressed egfp, allowing easy identification of the successfully transfected myoblasts, and observation of the differentiation of these myoblasts into mature myotubes. transfection efficiencies at the myoblast level were 40–50%, which upon differentiation and fusion led to close to 100% of the myotubes expressing egfp . by western blot analysis of c2c <dig> myotube lysates we probed for the effective suppression of endogenous shp- <dig> protein. one of the three constructs, termed psuper.shshp <dig>  led to a strong  reduction of endogenous shp- <dig> protein levels when compared to control transfected myotubes . we therefore proceeded to analyze the effect of shp- <dig> downregulation on other postsynaptic proteins. in immunoblots, levels of other postsynaptic proteins such as musk, src, rapsyn and β-dystroglycan were not affected by shp- <dig> knockdown . using radioligand binding of 125i-α-btx we probed functional surface achrs following transfection with psuper.shshp <dig> and observed no significant effect . psuper.shshp <dig> thus allows specific and strong knockdown of shp- <dig> without interfering with other muscle proteins.

shp- <dig> is required for stabilization of achr clusters in cultured myotubes
to study the role of shp- <dig> for achr cluster stability, we used c2c <dig> myotubes and suppressed shp- <dig> by shrna as described above. we incubated the cells with agrin to induce maximal clustering and withdrew the agrin to assess the stability of the clusters. in both control cells  and after shp- <dig> knockdown , spontaneous achr aggregates were present and agrin induced strong clustering of the receptors , similar to a recent report  <cit> . after withdrawal of agrin for  <dig> h, few clusters remained in psuper.shshp2-transfected cells whereas more clusters were present in psuper-treated cells .

to quantitate the effect of shp- <dig> knockdown on the stability of agrin-induced achr clusters, we normalized the number of achr clusters following agrin withdrawal  to the number of clusters that were induced by agrin  in psuper.shshp2- and psuper-transfected cells. the result shows that there is a significant decrease in the stability of achr clusters following agrin withdrawal when shp- <dig> expression is knocked down by shrna . these data illustrate that shp- <dig> is required for optimal stabilization of achr clusters in cultured myotubes.

requirement of shp- <dig> for stabilization of postsynaptic achr pretzels at the nmj in vivo
to address the role of shp- <dig> in stabilization of postsynaptic achrs at the nmj in vivo, we used rna interference in soleus muscles of adult mice as described earlier  <cit> . the shrna construct psuper.shshp <dig>  together with a construct expressing gfp containing a nuclear localization signal , was introduced into adult soleus muscle by electroporation. after  <dig> weeks, muscles were dissected, stained as whole mount preparations with rhodamine-α-btx and antibodies against neurofilament and synaptophysin, and analyzed by confocal microscopy including 3d reconstruction.

the in vivo expression of psuper.shshp <dig> led to the disassembly of adult pretzel-shaped achr clusters . this was in sharp contrast to the intact achr pretzel structures observed at nmjs of neighboring gfp-negative myofibers  and of myofibers of mice electroporated with control psuper vector and nls-gfp .

disassembled nmjs of myofibers expressing shp- <dig> shrna lost their typical pretzel morphology and were fragmented  and sometimes altogether widened in appearance . in addition, the synapse-associated myonuclei were sometimes no longer tightly packed subsynaptically but associated more loosely with the disassembled achr pretzel . in contrast, in myofibers electroporated with control psuper vector, the nerve was hardly visible from inside the muscle and synaptic nuclei were clustered just beneath the achr pretzels .

a quantitative assessment was made following the criteria described earlier  <cit> , by analyzing many nmjs from several mice, for both psuper.shshp <dig> and psuper control vector. in the control, almost all nmjs scored as intact, but in myofibers where shp- <dig> was suppressed, only a minority  of all nmjs analyzed was intact and most synapses scored as disassembled. these data show that shp- <dig> is required for maintenance of the adult postsynaptic apparatus of the nmj in vivo including typical pretzel-shaped achr domains and synaptic myonuclei. these results are very similar to the role of shp- <dig> in stabilization of agrin-induced achr clusters in myotubes in vitro.

elevated levels of shp- <dig> in the absence of src and fyn
we have observed similar destabilizing effects on achr clusters in c2c <dig> myotubes upon ptp inhibition by pervanadate, and upon knockdown of shp- <dig> by shrna . this instability is also present in the absence of src and fyn  <cit> , or upon blocking sfks with the inhibitor pp <dig>  and is rescued completely by inhibition of phosphatase activity by pervanadate . these observations lead to the conclusion that it is the balance between ptk and ptp activity that regulates the stability of achr clusters in myotubes. for this reason we sought to compare the levels of shp- <dig> between src-/-;fyn-/- myotubes and wild-type myotubes. we carried out western blot analysis of myotube lysates, and found that shp- <dig> levels are 3-fold higher in myotubes lacking src and fyn compared to wild-type myotubes . this finding suggests that these high levels of shp- <dig> may cause cluster destabilization and further strengthens our proposal that a crucial aspect for achr cluster stabilization is the balance between src and fyn, and ptps such as shp- <dig> 

discussion
we have analyzed the role of ptps in the stabilization of achr clusters and report that ptps are required for cluster maintenance and that the fine balance between ptps and sfks is a key aspect in this process. on one hand, block of ptps by pervanadate or knockdown of shp- <dig> in wild-type myotubes both rendered agrin-induced clusters less stable. in vivo, shp- <dig> knockdown in muscle caused disassembly of adult pretzel-shaped achr-rich areas at nmjs. on the other hand, pervanadate restored the defective stability of clusters in myotubes lacking sfk activity, and src-/-;fyn-/- myotubes had elevated levels of shp- <dig>  thus, ptps such as shp- <dig> stabilize achr clusters under normal circumstances, but when these ptps are not balanced by sfks, they render clusters unstable.

ptps such as shp- <dig> stabilize achr clusters
we used two approaches to illustrate the role of ptps in the maintenance of achr clusters: inhibiting the activity of all ptps by pervanadate, and testing the role of a candidate ptp, shp- <dig>  the stability of achr clusters was modeled in cell culture, by adding and then removing agrin, and pervanadate was added at the point of agrin withdrawal to specifically test its effect on the maintenance of pre-existing agrin-induced clusters. the withdrawal and washing procedure removes the vast majority of agrin from cells, such that signaling processes in the myotubes during the withdrawal phase do not reflect the activity of extracellular agrin but ongoing processes within the myotubes  <cit> . when agrin is withdrawn from wild-type myotubes, achr clusters slowly disintegrate over the course of several hours  <cit> . block of ptps by pervanadate accelerated the decay of clusters, showing that ptp activity is a requirement for optimal achr cluster stability. this was a specific process, since pervanadate as such did not alter levels of spontaneous achr clustering. rather, following an agrin stimulation to produce maximal aggregates, ptps act to fully maintain these clusters.

ptps exist in many families, as receptor tyrosine phosphatases or cytosolic non-receptor phosphatases, similar to kinase families. while several ptps could share the function of maintaining achr clusters, we identified shp- <dig> as one ptp that plays such a role. shp- <dig> has previously been put into the context of the nmj as a regulator of achr synthesis and musk activity  <cit> , and we first further verified whether shp- <dig> is located to play a postsynaptic role. we found shp- <dig> to associate with musk, and this association to be increased  by an agrin treatment that caused heavy musk tyrosine phosphorylation. in cos cells, musk and shp- <dig> showed colocalization in membrane ruffles at the plasma membrane, implying that they can interact with each other independently of muscle-specific linker proteins. these data show that shp- <dig>  by increasingly interacting with musk, is positioned to control postsynaptic stability of achr clusters.

we determined the role of shp- <dig> in the stabilization of achr clusters by an rnai strategy, using vector-driven shrna and short-hairpin loops that were previously used to knock down shp- <dig>  <cit> . one of the shrna constructs tested  was effective in myotubes when using an efficient transfection protocol that allowed its expression in nearly 100% of myotubes. psuper.shshp <dig> massively reduced protein amounts of shp- <dig> without significantly interfering with other postsynaptic proteins such as musk, src, rapsyn and β-dystroglycan or with levels of functional achr at the cell surface. this specificity in knockdown allowed the study of the role of shp- <dig> in achr cluster stability.

in the absence of normal shp- <dig> levels, spontaneous achr aggregates were present and achr clusters were induced by agrin, but the stability of these clusters was reduced compared to controls, showing that, similar to the results described above with pervanadate, shp- <dig> stabilizes achr clusters. shp- <dig> was also important at nmjs in vivo, because electroporation of psuper.shshp <dig> into adult mouse soleus muscle led to disassembly of the postsynapse: pretzel-shaped achr-rich areas became fragmented and some lost their overall pretzel outline, and sometimes myonuclei were no longer packed subsynaptically but more loosely associated with fragmented achr cluster remnants. taken together, our data show that shp- <dig> is a ptp that, perhaps together with other ptps, contributes to the maintenance of achr clusters at nmjs in vivo and in cultured myotubes in vitro.

upon knockdown of shp- <dig>  fragments of achr clusters were visible at nmjs but not in cultured myotubes from which agrin had been withdrawn. in myotubes, cluster disappearance appears as a statistical process whereby some clusters still exist while others have vanished and are outside the detectable ranges used in our method. this could point towards differences in cluster dynamics between our in vitro and in vivo systems. such differences could result from one or more of several possibilities: at nmjs, the turnover of achrs is much slower and the subsynaptic cytoskeleton more elaborate, presumably immobilizing the achr in a stronger fashion; cultured myotubes lack innervation and the continuous presence of basal lamina-anchored agrin as seen in vivo; and the timing of achr cluster disassembly is different as indicated by the different time scale of our in vivo vs. in vitro analysis. however, equally likely is the possibility that upon shp- <dig> knockdown and agrin withdrawal, achr cluster fragments do exist in cultured myotubes but cannot be visualized due to low intensity; in comparison the density of achrs in pretzels is much higher in vivo. furthermore, fragments of achr pretzels may completely disappear from psuper.shshp2-expressing myofibers after prolongated times.

there are several possibilities of how shp- <dig> could act to maintain clusters. the agrin-induced increase in musk-shp- <dig> interaction is very similar to shp- <dig> association with tyrosine phosphorylated dok <dig>  a member of insulin receptor substrate protein family that binds β <dig>  association with dok <dig> also occurs under basal conditions, and upon stimulation of dok <dig> by insulin-like growth factor i , shp-2-dok <dig> association increases  <dig> -fold. this association is important for dok <dig> to present shp- <dig> to downstream shps- <dig>  <cit> . in a similar fashion, shp- <dig> associates, via its sh <dig> domains, to other rtks including the platelet-derived growth factor  and epidermal growth factor  receptors  <cit> . in shp- <dig>  the engagement of the n-sh <dig> domain is required for its activation  <cit> . by inference, in our case, shp- <dig> recruitment to tyrosine phosphorylated musk may allow for proper shp- <dig> localization at the muscle membrane, and at sites where its phosphatase activity would be required in postsynaptic stabilization. possible downstream targets of recruited shp- <dig> could be musk itself, allowing fine-tuning of musk phosphorylation levels in a feedback mechanism  <cit>  or sfks. shp- <dig> is known to interact  <cit>  and positively regulate src activity, either directly or through intermediate proteins such as pag and csk  <cit> . shp- <dig> could also associate with and dephosphorylate the achr as proposed earlier  <cit> ; the achr is known to undergo dephosphorylation in myotubes, since pervanadate treatment rapidly causes strong achr β phosphorylation  <cit> .

the balance does the trick: upon lack of balance by sfks, ptps destabilize achr clusters
we unraveled the mechanism by which ptps such as shp- <dig> act in stabilizing postsynaptic achr clusters by testing their interplay with sfks. we used two models: src-/-;fyn-/- myotubes, and wild-type  myotubes treated with the specific inhibitor pp <dig>  in both situations, agrin induced normal achr clusters, but upon agrin withdrawal these clusters disintegrated more rapidly than in the parallel controls. importantly, in both src-/-;fyn-/- myotubes and pp2-treated c2c <dig> myotubes, blocking ptps with pervanadate after agrin induction restored stability of the pre-existing agrin-induced clusters. this stabilization was a specific process by several criteria: pervanadate did not alter levels of spontaneous clusters; the stability, not the formation of clusters was affected by having less sfks; and when added together with agrin, pervanadate did not affect formation of achr clusters in src-/-;fyn-/- myotubes. interestingly, src-/-;fyn-/- myotubes were found to have substantially elevated levels of shp- <dig> protein. the elevated amounts may be the result of changes in shp- <dig> synthesis, turnover or degradation, and the amounts may be an attempt of src-/-;fyn-/- myotubes to produce normal sfk activity, because shp- <dig> is known to activate sfks, at least in other cells  <cit> . along the same lines, levels of the sfk member yes are upregulated in src-/-;fyn-/- myotubes  <cit> .

collectively, our data show that in the absence of normal sfk activity, ptps no longer act to stabilize achr clusters . rather, ptps, when not counterbalanced by sfks, destabilize the clusters, and blocking ptp activity restores cluster stability. in a related mechanism, agrin activates ptks as well as ptps in xenopus muscle cells, and this allows formation of new achr clusters but at the same time causes disassembly of pre-existing spontaneous achr hotspots. hotspot disassembly is blocked by pervanadate, implying that agrin-activated ptps disassemble achr clusters when they are not protected by local agrin-activated ptks  <cit> .

our findings strengthen the proposal that it is the balance between ptks such as sfks and ptps such as shp- <dig>  which controls achr cluster stability. in src-/-;fyn-/- myotubes, elevated shp- <dig> levels could be causing the instability of achr clusters. using the inhibitor pervanadate on these myotubes could bring down the phosphatase activity, normalizing the ptp-ptk balance in the system, and allowing for more stable achr clusters. on the other hand, in wild-type myotubes phosphatase inhibition by pervanadate reduces the phosphatase activity below normal levels, tipping the balance towards increased ptk activity, and leading to a destabilization of the system and consequently of achr clusters.

the balance of sfks and shp- <dig> also plays in vivo: very similar to our present findings on shp- <dig>  it was recently shown, using the same electroporation technique, that a decrease or increase in sfk activity causes disassembly of postsynaptic pretzel-shaped achr clusters and often displacement of subsynaptic myonuclei  <cit> . thus interfering with sfk activity produces the same effect as reducing shp- <dig> function at nmjs in vivo.

our results describe a "phosphostat", which is required to keep achr clusters optimally stable, but what could be the effector machinery that translates this phosphostat into postsynaptic stability? most likely it is not just a classic simple mechanism where ptks phosphorylate targets whereas ptps dephosphorylate them. rather, it appears to be a combination of common phosphorylation substrates and mutual control of activity of ptks and ptps. since shp- <dig> positively controls the activity of src kinase  <cit> , block of shp- <dig> would result in less src activity, leading to unstable achr clusters. this may indeed be part of the situation in our c2c <dig> myotubes and at nmjs in vivo, where ptp block or shp- <dig> knockdown destabilizes achr clusters. on the other hand, achr β subunit phosphorylation is a factor for efficient receptor clustering and cytoskeletal anchorage, and the achr is dephosphorylated by ptps, as shown by its overphosphorylation due to pervanadate treatment  <cit> , also in our cultures . with this in mind, blocking ptps would be expected to lead to more stable achr phosphorylation and thus to more stable clusters. however, the fact that pervanadate treatment increases achr phosphorylation but destabilizes achr clusters shows that phosphorylation of the receptor itself is not sufficient to keep clusters stable. rather, other processes govern the stability of achr aggregates, and shp-2-mediated sfk activation governing activation of downstream substrates is one possibility in vitro and in vivo.

in the absence of sfks, unbalanced ptp activity leads to dephosphorylation of achrs, as shown in the agrin withdrawal phase in src-/-;fyn-/- myotubes  <cit> , and most likely of other downstream substrates such as cytoskeletal organizers. accordingly, the strength of the overall cytoskeletal link of achrs is reduced in src-/-;fyn-/- myotubes  <cit> . from studies on non-muscle cells, cortactin, p190rhogap and wasp are known direct substrates of sfks and involved, via direct or indirect action upon the arp2/ <dig> complex, in the dynamics of actin filaments  <cit> . actin reorganization, in turn, and the action of rac and cdc <dig>  are important in clustering of achrs  <cit> . dephosphorylation of such regulators in the absence of sfks could be a further reason for postsynaptic instability  <cit> , and blocking ptps could restore the activity of the regulators to normal operating levels, thereby stabilizing clusters.

these considerations lead to a model in which, in the stabilization phase of postsynaptic achr clusters, ptps such as shp- <dig> associate with musk. besides fine-tuning musk dephosphorylation, ptps keep, indirectly or directly, sfks activated . this activity maintains achr β phosphorylation, achr-rapsyn interaction  <cit>  and may maintain phosphorylation of critical downstream cytoskeletal regulators at operating levels. in parallel, ptps such as shp- <dig> dephosphorylate achrs and the downstream regulators . under normal circumstances the balance of process a and b leads to a certain level of achr and substrate phosphorylation, keeping clusters stable. upon block of ptps, sfk activity is compromised and clusters unstable. in the absence of sfks, process b dominates, destabilizing clusters, but ptp block rescues stability.

thus the effector pathway that operates between this ptp-ptk phosphostat and postsynaptic stabilization through achr phosphorylation and cytoskeletal intermediates could be complex and awaits further investigation. another level of complexity lies in the possible compensation between different ptps or between ptp families, and this could explain why upon inactivation of the shp- <dig> gene in muscle, no clear effect was seen at nmjs in vivo  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our data show that ptps such as shp- <dig> stabilize postsynaptic achr clusters and that the fine balance between ptps and sfks is a key aspect in this process. the data are the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate a role for a tyrosine phosphatase in postsynaptic stabilization of a synapse in the nervous system in vivo. previous reports concentrated on the role of ptps in neurotransmitter receptor trafficking underlying synaptic plasticity  <cit> , identified presynaptic ptp actions  <cit> , or were limited to in vitro cultured neurons  <cit> .

in our experiments, pharmacological inhibition of ptps or knockdown of shp- <dig> render achr clusters less stable, whereas ptp inhibition restores the defective stability of clusters in myotubes lacking sfk activity. in addition, src-/-;fyn-/- myotubes, which have unstable achr clusters, show elevated levels of shp- <dig> protein. thus, under normal circumstances ptps such as shp- <dig> stabilize achr clusters; but when these ptps they are not balanced by sfks, then they destabilize clusters.

while the crucial role of a balance between ptps such as shp- <dig> and kinases such as sfks for achr cluster maintenance is clear from the present study, the underlying cytoskeletal pathways and downstream targets await further investigation.
