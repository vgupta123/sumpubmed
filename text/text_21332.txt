BACKGROUND
the ability to survive the extremely low ph environment present within the stomach  is essential for colonization of the intestine by commensals and for the pathogenesis of enteric bacteria. three distinct acid resistance  systems are responsible for protecting bacterial cells from acid shock  <cit> . ar system  <dig> is a glucose-repressed system and does not require any external amino acids to function at low ph  <cit> . unidentified components of this system are controlled by the alternate sigma factor rpos, with the underlying mechanism remaining unclear  <cit> . in contrast, ar systems  <dig> and  <dig> provide ar by consuming intracellular protons via the glutamate  and arginine  decarboxylation reactions  <cit> . ar <dig> is the most efficient ar system. it involves two isozymes of glutamate decarboxylase, encoded by genes gada and gadb, and a membrane-associated antiporter  that exchanges external glutamate for the intracellular decarboxylation product γ-aminobutyric acid   <cit> .

ar <dig> is hierarchically regulated by multiple regulators, which include small noncoding rnas  dsra and possibly gady. dsra activates the expression of rpos  <cit>  and several ar genes including hdeab, gadax, and gadbc  <cit> . gady, whose effects on ar have yet to be determined, controls the synthesis of gadx and gadw, which are regulators of the gada and gadb glutamate decarboxylases  <cit> . in recent years, an increasing number of sncrnas have been identified, but the functions of the vast majority of these are unknown. this prompted us to investigate whether sncrnas in addition to dsra and gady, were involved in ar; and if so, to establish how they exerted their regulatory actions.

in the present study, seventy-nine snrnas identified prior to  <dig>  <cit>  were selected for the construction of a single-gene knockout library within e. coli k12-mg <dig>  comparison of each mutant with the wild type strain enabled us to identify the sncrna gcvb as a previously unknown regulator of ar in e. coli. we demonstrate that gcvb positively regulates ar predominantly by upregulating the levels of the rpos transcription factor . our findings provide further insight into the regulatory roles played by sncrnas in ar, which contributes to virulence of e. coli.

RESULTS
construction of single-sncrna gene knockout mutant collection in e. coli k- <dig> mg1655
to systematically characterize sncrnas, we established a single-sncrna gene knockout library within e. coli k12-mg <dig>  recombineering techniques were used to replace the target gene with a selectable chloramphenicol-resistance cassette, which was generated by polymerase chain reaction  using primers containing homology  to the gene-flanking regions. this homologous recombination-based approach enabled precise gene deletion with minimal interference to adjacent genes   <cit> . in total, seventy-nine genes encoding sncrnas identified prior to  <dig>  <cit>  were deleted individually from the mg <dig> chromosome .

the sncrna gcvb is a novel regulator of ar in e. coli
we investigated the involvement of sncrnas in the ar of e. coli by challenging the sncrna mutants as well as the wild type strain by incubation in lb medium at ph  <dig>  , and comparing their percent survival and/or rates of recovery after ph neutralization . unless otherwise stated, bacterial cells were grown for  <dig> hrs to the early stationary phase before the acid challenge. as expected, cells lacking dsra, which is a known ar regulator, were sensitive to the acid challenge, confirming previous findings   <cit> . however, deleting gady did not affect acid survival , suggesting that gady is not required for ar in spite of its positive control of gadx, a transcriptional activator of the gada and gadb glutamate decarboxylases  <cit> . interestingly, the absence of the sncrna gcvb resulted in a significant reduction in acid survival . the same ar phenotypes in the sncrna mutants were also observed during the exponential growth phase , suggesting that gcvb exerts constant ar regulatory functions throughout the various growth phases. we also individually deleted gcva and ygdi which are the two genes immediately adjacent to gcvb. both mutants displayed comparable ar as the wild type . this shows that the observed acid vulnerability in the gcvb mutant is not due to the disruption of the activities of its adjacent genes.

next, we cloned the gene encoding gcvb  into plasmid pet32a  and overexpressed the sncrna in the e. coli mg <dig> gcvb null mutant. the gcvb mutant carrying an empty vector served as a negative control. we found that overproducing gcvb restored the ability of the gcvb mutant to survive at low ph . these observations together with the knockout data revealed that gcvb acts as a positive regulator of ar.

the known gcvb target oppa plays a minor, if any, role in gcvb-mediated ar
gcvb has been demonstrated to repress the translation of oppa and dppa in e. coli by masking the ribosome binding sites of their mrnas, which encode periplasmic substrate-binding proteins of abc uptake systems for amino acids and peptides  <cit> . to determine whether these two proteins played a role in gcvb-mediated ar, we individually deleted their encoding genes, and examined the ability of the resultant mutants to survive at low ph. we found that deleting oppa slightly increased ar, as revealed by their acid recovery  and percent acid survival  levels, while the absence of dppa had little effect on ar . thus dppa is not involved in gcvb-mediated ar, and oppa plays a minor, if any, role in this process. we reasoned that the gcvb sncrna may be exerting its effects on ar via a previously unidentified molecular target.

gcvb mediates ar by upregulating rpos expression
rpos is the central regulator of glutamate-dependent ar <dig> genes such as gada, gadbc  <cit> , gadx  <cit> , gade  <cit> , and gady  <cit> . it is also required for the ar <dig> system  <cit> . we therefore set out to determine whether gcvb regulated ar by modulating rpos expression levels. we found that deleting gcvb did not lead to a further reduction in acid survival levels in an rpos mutant background . more importantly, the absence of rpos completely abolished ar elicited by the plasmid-encoded gcvb , suggesting that gcvb-mediated ar is dependent on rpos. next, an rpos-lacz translational fusion was constructed to examine whether the presence or absence of the gcvb sncrna significantly affected rpos expression levels. deleting gcvb reduced the expression levels of the rpos-lacz fusion by 50% , whereas gcvb overexpression increased it 3-fold . furthermore, deleting oppa, whose absence had previously been shown to slightly increase ar levels, had no effect on rpos-lacz expression . this indicates that the gcvb-mediated regulation of rpos expression does not involve oppa.

we then investigated whether gcvb indirectly controls rpos production via an upstream regulator. in the literature, there are numerous reports outlining mechanisms by which the synthesis of rpos is regulated at the transcriptional  <cit> , translational and posttranslational levels  <cit> . of these regulators of rpos expression, crp  <cit> , h-ns  <cit> , gadx  <cit> , and a hybrid sensor kinase called bara  <cit>  have previously been associated with ar. although bara acts as a positive regulator of rpos transcription, its effect is restricted to the exponential phase. it is therefore unlikely that bara is a potential target for gcvb. consequently, we examined whether gcvb exerts its positive control of rpos through crp, h-ns or gadx. we found that deleting gcvb reduced acid survival levels in an hns mutant background. this was also the case for crp- or gadx-deficient strains . consistent with the knockout data, gcvb overexpression increased ar levels in the hns-, crp- or gadx-deficient strains . these results suggest that hns, crp and gadx are not involved in the gcvb-mediated regulation of rpos expression.

rpos transcription is driven by a major promoter rposp and two weak promoters nlpdp <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . to examine whether gcvb affected rpos expression at the transcriptional level, we deleted the region spanning the rposp, nlpdp <dig> and  <dig> promoter sites . as removing these promoters will eliminate rpos expression, a constitutive promoter encoded in the knockout cassette  was used to drive rpos transcription in the absence of rposp, nlpdp <dig> and  <dig>  the resulting mutant was referred to as d567– <dig>  as shown in fig.  <dig>  replacing the native promoters of rpos with this heterologous promoter had little effect on gcvb-induced ar. these results indicate that gcvb does not regulate rpos expression at the transcriptional level.

discussion
in this study, we constructed a library comprising single-gene knockout mutants of seventy-nine sncrna genes in e. coli. we used this mutant collection to identify sncrnas involved in acid resistance  within this bacterium. consequently, we were able to identify the sncrna gcvb as a novel regulator of ar.

dppa and oppa, which were previously identified as targets of gcvb, were shown not to be responsible for gcvb-mediated ar. while the dppa deletion did not affect ar, the absence of oppa slightly improved the ability of e. coli to survive under extreme acid conditions. since gcvb-mediated inhibition of oppa and dppa only weakly increased ar, we reasoned that the gcvb sncrna may be regulating ar via some other mechanistic pathway.

upon rpos deletion, gcvb had no influence on ar. furthermore, we found that gcvb positively regulated rpos expression. deleting oppa had no effect on the levels of rpos, providing evidence that the gcvb-mediated control of rpos does not involve the oppa protein. also, gcvb does not regulate rpos via h-ns, crp, or gadx; as gcvb-mediated ar was unaffected when these genes were singularly deleted. the region spanning from - <dig> to - <dig> nt harbors all three of the of the rpos promoters . replacing these native promoters with the constitutive promoter from a cm knockout cassette had no affect on gcvb-mediated ar. this suggests that gcvb does not regulate rpos expression at the transcriptional level.

like gcvb, the sncrnas dsra and rpra also act as positive regulators of ar in e. coli. dsra and rpra bind to the same region of the 5' leader of rpos mrna. a sequence within this region was previously predicted to form a self-inhibitory stem loop structure that probably occludes the shine-dalgarno ribosome binding site and prevents translation  <cit> . dsra  <cit>  and rpra  <cit>  bind to this stem-loop structure, free the ribosome binding site, and thereby mediate rpos translation. this region also contains rnase iii cleavage sites that result in rapid decay of the rpos transcript  <cit> . the base-pairing of dsra within this region stabilizes rpos mrna by creating an alternative rnase iii cleavage site  <cit> . as for gcvb, it regulates rpos expression by an unknown mechanism. computational sequence analyses using the rnahybrid server  <cit>  have indicated that gcvb does not contain any extensive regions of sequence complementary to the 5' leader of rpos mrna . as such, the mechanism by which gcvb regulates rpos expression remains a subject of further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
here we reveal that the sncrna gcvb positively regulates the ability of e. coli to survive low ph conditions by upregulating the expression of rpos. our findings provide insight into the control of ar by gcvb. however, further detailed studies will be required to investigate the precise nature of the gcvb/rpos interaction at the molecular level.
