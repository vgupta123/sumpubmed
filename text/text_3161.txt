BACKGROUND
the genomes of crustaceans are extremely diverse in their size, with the smallest one having a c-value of  <dig>  pg and the largest one weighing  <dig>  pg, differing by a factor of  <dig>  <cit> . despite their economic importance and production in huge biomass, little is known about the genome organization of crustaceans, especially malacostraca  except for the presence of numerous repetitive sequences  <cit> . recently, although the genomic dna sequence of a crustacean, water flea daphnia pulex, has been determined, it seems improper to make any conclusion on the crustacean genome because recent phylogenetic analysis based on the dna sequence data and morphology comparison between hexapoda  and crustacea provided an unexpected finding that branchiopoda  is phylogenetically much closer to hexapoda rather than malacostraca  <cit> . therefore, the crustacean genome, in particular the genetic differences between branchiopoda and hexapoda group and other sister groups need to be elucidated.

the penaeid shrimp, which is classified into decapoda in malacostraca, has been the subject of intense research. due to its commercial value, several papers on expressed sequence tag  analysis and genetic linkage mapping has been published in the past few years. however, in depth information of their large genome, which is estimated to be about 70% of human genome in size and rich in at and aat sequences, is largely unknown  <cit> . as the first step towards understanding the shrimp genome organization, we constructed a bac library  from kuruma shrimp  and performed bac-end sequencing. the results clearly showed extreme redundancy of certain sequences in many bac clones of the mjbl <dig> library. we chose one bac clone  for detailed analysis in terms of its entire sequence and redundancy in the shrimp genome and found numerous copies of dna segments that contain the mj024a04-sequence. this indicates that hyper-expansion of such peculiar dna segments occurred through segmental duplication events during evolution of the kuruma shrimp genome.

RESULTS
bac library construction and bac-end sequencing
to provide an overview of the composition and organization of the kuruma shrimp nuclear genome, we constructed bac library  using kuruma shrimp genomic dna prepared from hemocytes of  <dig> shrimps and analyzed the bac-end sequence . mjbl <dig> consists of  <dig>  bac clones, which were arrayed in  <dig> microtiter plates and stored at -80Â°c. the average insert size was estimated to be  <dig> kb by noti digestion of  <dig> randomly selected bac clones. bes analysis was further performed using  <dig> bac clones randomly selected from mjbl <dig> and retrieved reads were assembled for contiguity . resulting bess were classified into  <dig> singletons and  <dig> contiguous sequences consisting of  <dig> to  <dig> reads. notably, the blastn and blastx analyses revealed that many of these bess  contained a sequence encoding a protein similar to "inhibitor of apoptosis protein " reported in black tiger shrimp  .

dna sequence of a representative bac clone
one of the bac clones  that possessed a sequence similar to "black tiger shrimp iap" gene was randomly selected from mjbl <dig> for detailed analysis of its entire dna sequence by employing shotgun sequencing method. the resulting genomic dna sequence of  <dig> kb  was analyzed by in silico annotation, revealing  <dig> putative genes that apparently seemed to be normal genomic region with exon-intron structure  . as shown in figure  <dig>  large ggtta repeats were found in the middle of the sequence flanking gene  <dig>  which encodes a protein similar to a reverse transcriptase of takifugu rubripes  <cit> . notably, of the other  <dig> genes, three genes  encode a protein homologous to iap of three species, xenopus laevis , drosophila melanogaster  and rattus norvegicus  and seven genes  were homologous to orfs in "white spot syndrome virus ", the major shrimp pathogenic dsdna virus, which is highly virulent to penaeid shrimps as well as other crustaceans such as crabs and crayfish  <cit> .

redundancy of mj024a04-sequence homologues in the kuruma shrimp bac library
to determine what portion of the mj024a04-sequence were redundant in the mjbl2-kuruma shrimp bac library, we performed colony hybridization using three distinct probes that correspond to the 5'-end , middle  and 3'-end  of the mj024a04-sequence . surprisingly, numerous bac clones were positive for at least one of the three distinct probes used  suggesting that relevant dna fragments are highly redundant in the mjbl2-kuruma shrimp bac library. the  <dig> positive bac clones were sorted into  <dig> groups based on the hybridization pattern  . furthermore, we examined possible amplification of the  <dig> out of  <dig> putative genes  on  <dig> bac clones  that were proven to be independent by dna fingerprinting with restriction enzymes hindiii and ecori . ten of the  <dig> genes  were selected because they match other genes in the databases with e-values less than 1e- <dig> and the other seven  were selected because of their homology to wssv genes. as seen in figure  <dig>  two genes  were present in group f; seven genes  in group f+m; seven genes  in group m; all genes except gene  <dig> in group f+m+r; twelve genes  in group m+r; nine genes  in group r. as expected, some genes were not detected because size of the inserted kuruma shrimp dna fragments in the selected bac clones varied. nevertheless, it is noted that in the group f+m+r, which were supposed to contain all genes, all of the genes except gene  <dig>  which was assigned as retro-transposon, were indeed detected . the independent amplifications of the retro-transposon  in the bac clone samples can be explained by its known nature, which tend to be randomly integrated  <cit> . random appearance of the retro-transposon suggests that the primordial dna fragment is void of this gene.

detection of mj024a04-sequence and its copy number in the kuruma shrimp genome
we next employed southern blot hybridization to detect multiple copies of mj024a04-sequence in the kuruma shrimp genome using several different restriction enzymes. results showed multiple dna bands for each of the  <dig> putative genes  , confirming the presence of multiple copies of these genes. in addition, we performed fluorescent in situ hybridization  using labeled mj024a <dig> bac clone. fish images clearly showed numerous fluorescence spots in the nucleus of the adult shrimp testis cells . with the duplication of the large repeats, we further examined the copy number of the putative genes by quantitative pcr of gene  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> using genomic dnas prepared from  <dig> different organs  and  <dig> larvae. our results indicated that copy numbers of those putative genes are  <dig> times more than the putative single copy gene transglutaminase , except for the gene  <dig> . this suggested the presence of multiple copies of mj024a04-sequence . taken all together, our results suggest that large dna fragment mj024a <dig> occurs numerous times in the genome.

bac genotyping and pcr detection of putative genes in mj024a04-sequence
to exclude a possible cloning bias, we performed bac genotyping using three microsatellite polymorphisms.  <dig> different genotypes out of  <dig> f, m, r positive bac clones screened from mjbl <dig> plate  <dig> to  <dig> representing  <dig>  coverage of shrimp genome were detected . pcr-based putative gene detection on eight independent bac clones selected from different genotypes showed the presence of almost all of the  <dig> putative genes . assuming that all shrimps have heterogeneous chromosomes, two genotypes from one allele should be detected. since we constructed mjbl <dig> library from  <dig> individuals, at most  <dig> different haplotypes were expected for one chromosomal locus. the  <dig> different genotypes detected indicate that at least  <dig> different chromosome loci contain duplications of the entire mj024a04-sequence. as we used only  <dig> bac clones from mjbl <dig> plate  <dig> to  <dig>  probability estimation method was also performed to estimate how many genotypes could be detected if we performed screening and genotyping with excess bac clones. this is done with the assumption that all of genotypes were present only once in the  <dig> diploid chromosomes of the kuruma shrimp  <cit> . result indicated  <dig> genotypes with 95% confidence interval  <dig> to  <dig>  suggesting that at least  <dig> different chromosome loci might appear in each haploid genome .

kuruma shrimp mj024a04-sequence has unique characteristic among arthropod genomes
we performed micro-synteny comparisons of mj024a04-sequence with genome sequences of other  <dig> arthropods drosophila melanogaster   <cit>  and daphnia pulex   <cit>  using tblastn algorithm. however, we could not find any micro-synteny relation between mj024a <dig> and drosophilla or daphnia genome , suggesting the uniqueness of mj024a04-sequence within known arthropod genomes.

discussion
bac library construction and bac-end sequencing for a first characterization of the kuruma shrimp genome
the amount of kuruma shrimp nuclear dna has been reported to be  <dig>  pg indicating that kuruma shrimp genome size is almost the same as other penaeid shrimps such as litopenaeus vannamei and penaeus monodon whose genome size are reported to be approximately  <dig>  mbp  <cit> . in this study, we first constructed bac library from the kuruma shrimp. average insert size of mjbl <dig> bac clones were estimated to be  <dig> kb and total mjbl <dig> insert size could be calculated as approximately  <dig>  mbp, showing that mjbl <dig> represented  <dig>  times coverage of kuruma shrimp genome. although mjbl <dig> is not suitable for physical mapping and genome sequencing because it was constructed from  <dig> shrimps, mjbl <dig> is useful as the first step for characterizing the kuruma shrimp genome. we performed bes analysis to acquire the first glimpse into the sequence composition of the unsequenced kuruma shrimp genome. the results of bes analysis were very surprising because even with only  <dig> clones analyzed, we detected  <dig> contigs and each contigs contained multiple reads varying from  <dig> to  <dig>  this suggested that following the typical bac construction method  <cit> , we obtained multiple copies of the same dna fragments in the kuruma shrimp genome. however, putative genes such as black tiger shrimp iap gene homologue that we annotated by blast does not seem to be the gene that has potential duplication activity like the transposable elements. to further ascertain the abnormality of the kuruma shrimp genome, we further analyzed these dna segment in the kuruma shrimp genome.

gene contents of a representative bac clone mj024a04
mj024a <dig> bac clone randomly selected from bac clones that possessed black tiger shrimp iap sequences was fully sequenced and  <dig> genes were predicted in silico. of the  <dig> predicted genes, we found three genes homologous to iap. it is known that apoptosis is a genetically programmed pathway of controlled cell suicide that has critical roles in several processes such as development, tissue homeostasis, dna damage responses and pathological processes  <cit> . iaps have been shown to block apoptosis by inhibition of the proteolytic activity of caspases, the central components of the apoptotic machinery, through direct binding of baculoviral iap repeat  domains present in the iaps  <cit> . cellular homologues called the bir-domain-containing protein  are characterized by the presence of a variable number of bir domains. these homologues have been identified in yeasts, nematodes, flies and higher vertebrates  <cit> . in drosophila, four kinds of iap homologues  have been found  <cit> . we analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of putative gene  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with other bir domains in several organisms . the bir domains in the putative gene  <dig> were clustered together with the bir domains found in black tiger shrimp iap gene, suggesting the putative gene  <dig> may have the same function as black tiger shrimp iap  <cit> . particularly of interest, putative gene  <dig> contains five bir domains and this is the first report on birps containing more than three bir domains. bir domains are known to play important roles in protein-protein interactions and it has been shown that the presence of multiple bir domains in a single protein molecule increases the affinity of birps to a target protein. in addition, the range of target molecules in which birps can interact also increases with the number of bir domains  <cit> . hence, putative gene  <dig> that has five bir domains may be a novel birp that has a different function.

furthermore, of the other  <dig> genes, we found seven genes homologous to orfs in wssv. it is known that certain mammalian dsdna viruses, such as herpesvirus and poxvirus, mimic structure and function of host genes to evade detection and destruction by the host immune system  <cit> . similarly, "potential horizontal gene transfers" has been found in baculoviruses, infectious pathogens of insects  <cit> , hence such viral genome structure can be regarded as repositories of important information about host immune processes  <cit> . the presence of multiple wssv-like genes in kuruma shrimp genome strongly suggests similar mimicking mechanisms or horizontal gene transfers can also be seen in this virus group. moreover, with the absence of homologous proteins in the current database, this information will provide a good starting point for understanding unknown wssv-host interactions.

the first identification of multiple duplications of large dna segments in the shrimp genome
as high-resolution whole genome sequences are not yet available for malacostraca or decapoda species, it is difficult to make any conclusion if multiple copies of peculiar large dna segments  found in kuruma shrimp are also present in other species. however, micro-synteny analysis revealed that mj024a04-sequence is not found in two other arthropod genomes, drosophila and daphnia, suggesting that the duplicated large dna fragments have occurred after establishment of malacostraca in the crustacea.

it is also unclear whether the redundancy is the result of polyploidization or segmental duplication. previous studies revealed a wide range of chromosome numbers and variation of genomic dna content in several species in decapoda, suggesting the possibility of polyploidization. however, re-association kinetics of genomic dna and electrophoretic analysis of enzyme polymorphism have suggested that polyploidization is considered to be a rare event  <cit> . thus, we assumed that highly redundant large dna segments in the kuruma shrimp may have arose from segmental duplication events.

segmental duplications  are duplicated blocks of genomic dna, typically ranging in size from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb  <cit> . sds are composed of apparently normal genomic dna containing high-copy repeats and gene sequences with intron-exon architecture, hence it is difficult to detect a priori without having well-assigned genome information  <cit> . in this regard, the human genome is the most studied genome about sds. human reference genome contains an abundance of large dna segments with various copy numbers , representing â¥ 5% of the genome, that have been accumulated through evolution over  <dig> million years  <cit> . these duplications are shown to be clustered up to 10-fold enrichment within pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions of human chromosomes  <cit> .

sds are also reported in drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . in fly, sds account for ~ <dig> % of the genome , ranging from  <dig> bp to  <dig>  kb in length. the drosophila genome appears to be significantly poor in large  duplicated blocks with only  <dig> % as compared to human genome. the chromosome  <dig> that appears to be enriched in heterochromatic domains and the pericentromeric regions of the chromosomes x,  <dig> and  <dig> in drosophila have also high sd density.

it is reported that subtelomeres are notably rich in degenerate telomeric repeats relative to adjacent single-copy sequences or other genomic regions  in the human genome  <cit> . we analyzed the number of kuruma shrimp bac clones harboring ggtta repeats based on colony hybridization  <cit> . results showed that the rate of ggtta-positive bac clone are found to be  <dig> times higher in the bac clones positive for f, m or r probes than ggtta-positive rate in all bac clones tested , suggesting that mj024a04-sequence and its duplicates are located predominantly in subtelomeric regions and perhaps in pericentromeric regions.

the absence of transcripts of putative genes in mj024a <dig> in several tissues of an adult shrimp
we attempted to detect rna transcripts for some putative genes analyzed in several tissues of kuruma shrimp but gene expression was so weak despite their high copy number. together with subtelomeric localization, we considered that this low level of gene expression might be caused by epigenetic control mechanisms, such as cpg-methylation, histone-hypoacetylation and histone-methylation. although we have attempted to detect cpg-methylation in mj024a <dig> segments by genomic sourthern blot analysis with cpg-methylation insensitive restriction enzyme mspi and its sensitive isoschizomer hpaii, we could not detect any cpg-methylation indicating that transcription level of mj024a <dig> is strictly suppressed by other factors .

CONCLUSIONS
genome rearrangements are common phenomena in the eukaryotes, which facilitate not only species diversification but also genetic variation within species. studies based on the whole genome sequence in primates suggest that significant proportion of the lineage-specific duplication results in different gene expression pattern and mechanistic consequence of changes in the chromosome structure  <cit> . furthermore, in a study on plasmodium falciparum, a causative agent of severe human malaria, the authors revealed that eight sds, which are located on seven different chromosomes, have copy number polymorphism among different strains. the expression levels of the genes found within the sds are also correlated in part with the gene copy number  <cit> . these studies strongly suggest that sds are widely distributed and play significant roles in making biological differences among closely related species. biological significance of sds in kuruma shrimp marsupenaeus japonicus is still obscure due to lack of the entire genome sequence information of decapoda species. nonetheless, it is interesting how sds and numerous putative genes such as wssv homologues act in this species. furthermore, such hyper-expansion of dna segments should be taken into serious consideration in whole-genome sequencing and effective construction of genetic linkage maps of this economically important species.
