BACKGROUND
porcine circovirus  is the smallest virus that replicates autonomously in mammalian cells. the viral genome consists of a covalently closed, circular, ambisense, single-stranded dna molecule  <cit> . two types of pcv , have been characterized to date  <cit> . pcv <dig> is a persistent contaminant of porcine kidney - <dig> cell lines and it is not considered to be pathogenic  <cit> . in contrast, pcv <dig> has been detected consistently in pigs with pcv-associated diseases such as post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome   <cit> .

the genome of pcv <dig> contains at least two open reading frames  with known functions: orf <dig> codes for two replicase proteins, and orf <dig> for the structural capsid protein  <cit> . the capsid protein is the only structural protein and the major protein involved in immunogenicity. at least five overlapping conformational epitopes of pcv <dig> capsid protein, within residues 47- <dig>  165- <dig> and 230- <dig>  have been mapped in chimeric pcv <dig> and pcv <dig>  <cit> . the conformational epitopes recognized by monoclonal antibodies  with neutralizing activity against pcv <dig> have been determined in the transfected pk- <dig> cells, and residues 231- <dig> participate in the formation of conformational epitopes  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis distinguishes three genotypes of pcv <dig>   <cit> . pcv2a and pcv2b are found in many countries, whereas pcv2c is only found in denmark  <cit> . recent epidemiological studies in many countries have linked a shift from infection with pcv2a to pcv2b  <cit> . although several studies have indicated that pcv2b is not more pathogenic than pcv2a  <cit> , field experience suggests that the pcv2b genotype is more virulent  <cit> . however, to date, there are no confirmed conclusions about which genotype is more pathogenic.

mouse mabs directed against pcv <dig> have shown some differences in reactivity with different pcv <dig> strains  <cit> . mabs  have been used to identify critical amino acids of conformational epitopes  <cit> . however, other critical amino acids of the conformational epitope with neutralizing activity against pcv <dig> capsid protein have not been identified.

in this study, one mab against the capsid protein of pcv <dig> was produced and characterized. meanwhile, one key amino acid constituent of the conformational epitope was identified by using chimeras and mutants of pcv2a/cl and pcv2b/yj strains.

methods
cells, viruses and antibodies
spodoptera frugiperda  cells , used for expression of the recombinant capsid protein of pcv2a/lg, were grown in grace's medium  supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum  and  <dig> % trypsin phosphate bean soup  at 27°c. pcv1-free pk- <dig> cells, grown in rpmi  <dig> medium  containing 10% heat-inactivated fbs, were used for virus propagation. sp2/ <dig> cells, cultured in rpmi  <dig> medium containing 10% fbs, were used for preparation of mabs.

a high-titer seed recombinant baculovirus that expressed recombinant capsid protein derived from pcv2a/lg strain was produced by liu et al.  <cit> . six different pcv <dig> strains adapted to pk- <dig> cells were used in this study. their origins, genotypes and genbank accession numbers are shown in table  <dig>  a recombinant virus designated as recpcv1/g was rescued from the infectious clone . the genome of this virus was amplified from contaminated pk- <dig> cells by pcv <dig>  genbank accession number of this virus is jn <dig> 

isolate name
porcine serum with antibodies against pcv2a/lg  and porcine serum with antibodies against recpcv1/g , along with porcine serum lacking specific antibodies against pcv <dig> and pcv <dig>  were derived from huang et al.  <cit> . it was confirmed that mab 6f <dig>  against the epitope in the nuclear location signal region of pcv <dig> capsid protein, did not react with pk- <dig> cells infected with pcv <dig>  and did not have the capacity to neutralize pcv <dig>  <cit> .

preparation of mab against pcv <dig> capsid protein
the production of one new mab against the capsid protein of pcv <dig> was performed as described previously  <cit> . the isotype of the mab was determined using a mouse monoab-id kit  .

western blot analysis
the reactivity of mab 8e <dig> to pcv2a/lg strain was determined by western blot analysis as described previously  <cit> . mab 6f <dig> and the supernatant of sp2/ <dig> cells were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.

immunoperoxidase monolayer assay 
the ipma was used to detect the reactivity of mab 8e <dig> to six pcv <dig> strains and one pcv <dig> strain. briefly, the 96-well ipma plates containing cells infected with pcv2a/lg, pcv2a/cl, pcv2a/jf <dig>  pcv2b/yj, pcv2b/sh, pcv2b/jf, recpcv1/g, and mock-infected cells, were produced and stored at -20°c as described by liu et al.  <cit> . the staining procedure was similar to the ipma technique described previously  <cit> . mab 8e <dig> was used as primary antibody. pcv2- or pcv1-positive serum and mab 6f <dig>  were used respectively as positive and negative controls. the results were examined under an inverted light microscope. the ipma was performed in triplicate.

serum neutralization assays
to detect the neutralizing activity of mab 8e <dig>  a serum neutralization assay was adapted from the method of lefebvre et al.  <cit> . briefly,  <dig>  × tcid <dig>  of pcv <dig> in a volume of  <dig> μl was incubated for  <dig> h at 37°c, with an equal volume of undiluted hybridoma supernatant containing mab against the pcv <dig> capsid protein. after incubation, this mixture was added to semi-confluent monolayers of pcv-negative pk- <dig> cells in four wells of a 96-well plate. after  <dig> h at 37°c, the cell cultures were washed twice with rpmi  <dig> and fresh medium was added. the cell cultures were incubated for a further  <dig> h at 37°c, then detected using the ipma as described by liu et al.  <cit>  with pcv2-positive serum. assays were performed with six different strains of pcv <dig>  and recpcv1/g. pcv2-positive sera and mab 6f <dig>  were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. the number of infected cells per well was determined by light microscopy. the neutralizing activity of the hybridoma supernatant was expressed as the percentage reduction in the number of infected cells in comparison with negative control. a mab was considered to have neutralizing ability when its mean neutralizing activity was > 50%.

capture elisa
to develop a pcv <dig> antigen capture elisa, the pcv2-positive serum and the supernatant of mab 8e <dig> were purified using protein a sepharose™cl-4b , respectively. the purified mab 8e <dig> was labeled using a peroxidase labeling kit  according to the manufacturer's instructions. elisa plates  were coated with purified pcv2-positive serum  in  <dig>  m carbonate buffer  overnight at 4°c. the plates were washed three times with pbs-t and blocked with  <dig> μl of pbs-t with 10% horse serum for  <dig> h at 37°c. one hundred microliters of the pcv <dig> strain cultures diluted in pbs-t to a final  <dig> tcid50/ml were distributed in each well and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> h. after washing with pbs-t,  <dig> μl mab  conjugated with horseradish peroxidase  diluted  in pbs-t was added, and the plates were incubated at 37°c for  <dig> min. after the plates had been washed three times, the colorimetric reaction was developed for  <dig> min by adding  <dig>  mg/ml  <dig> -azino-di  in  <dig>  m citrate  containing  <dig> % hydrogen peroxide . the reaction was stopped by adding  <dig> μl 1% naf. the optical density  was measured at  <dig> nm using a microplate reader . assays were performed with cultures of six different strains of pcv <dig> , recpcv1/g and mock-infected pk- <dig> cells . the capture elisa was performed in triplicate. a p /n  value >  <dig>  was considered positive.

analysis of orf <dig> from different strains
multiple alignments of amino acid sequences in the capsid protein of six strains of pcv <dig>  were performed using clustal w within the dnastar software .

construction of pcv2-orf2-cl/yj chimeras and mutants
plasmids pmd18/pcv2a-cl, pmd18/pcv2b-yj and pmd18/pcv2a-lg, containing the complete genomic sequences of the pcv2a/cl, pcv2b/yj and pcv2a/lg strains, were constructed as described previously  <cit> . plasmid pmd18/pcv2a-jf <dig> containing entire genomic sequences of pcv2a/jf <dig> strain was constructed as described by guo et al.  <cit>  with primers q-r and q-f . a series of chimeric pmd/pcv2- orf2-cl/yj  containing regions deletion of pmd/pcv2-cl-orf <dig> fused with the corresponding orf <dig> regions of yj-orf <dig> were constructed by fusion pcr or mutation pcr. briefly, the pmd18/pcv2a-cl templates were respectively pcr-amplified using primers a-f and a-r, c-f and c-r, e-f and e-r, or g-f and g-r  according to the instructions that accompany the kod-plus kit . those pcr products that did not contain regions  of pcv2a/cl capsid protein were respectively gel purified, and subsequently served as the templates for fusion pcr using primers b-f and b-r, d-f and d-r, f-f and f-r, or h-f and h-r , which inserted the corresponding regions of pcv2b/yj capsid protein. the fusion pcr products were then used to transform escherichia coli strain top <dig> according to the manufacturer's recommendations . the resulting chimeric plasmids were verified by sequence analyses  and were respectively designated as rcl-yj- <dig>  rcl-yj- <dig>  rcl-yj- <dig> and rcl-yj- <dig> . mutations were introduced into the pmd/pcv2a-cl-orf <dig>  pmd/pcv2a-lg-orf <dig>  pmd/pcv2a-jf2-orf <dig> and pmd/pcv2b-yj-orf <dig> by pcr using a set of primers  by quickchange lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit  according to the manufacturer's recommendations. the resulting plasmids were verified by sequence analyses  and were designated as rcl-yj- <dig>  rcl-yj-1- <dig>  rcl-yj-1- <dig>  rcl-yj-1- <dig>  rcl-yj-1- <dig>  rlg-yj-1- <dig>  rjf2-yj-1- <dig> and ryj-cl-1- <dig> .

in vitro transfection
plasmids were excised by sali digestion to produce sali fragments that contained the complete genomic sequence. the purified sali fragments were self-ligated for  <dig> min at 16°c, using t <dig> dna ligase , and subsequently transfected into pk- <dig> cells  in each well of a 24-well plate, using lipofectamine  <dig>  according to the manufacturer's instructions. mock-transfected pk- <dig> cells were regarded as the negative control. after incubation for  <dig> h at 37°c,  <dig> μl rpmi  <dig> containing 10% fbs was added to each well and incubated at 37°c with 5% co <dig>  at  <dig> h post transfection, the cells were tested in the ipma with pcv2-positive serum and mab 8e <dig> 

RESULTS
generation and characterization of mab against pcv <dig> capsid protein
one stable hybridoma secreting pcv <dig> mab was generated and designated as 8e <dig>  the isotype of the mab was identified with the mouse monoab-id kit . it was determined that the isotype and light chain of 8e <dig> was igg2a and λ type, respectively.

the reactivity of mab 8e <dig> with pcv2a/lg strain purified by ultracentrifugation was determined by western blot analysis . mab 6f <dig>  gave a strong and specific reaction with the 28-kda capsid protein of pcv <dig>  however, mab 8e <dig> did not give a positive reaction. no reaction was observed with the culture supernatant of sp2/ <dig> cells, used as a negative control.

reactivity of mab 8e <dig> with different pcv <dig> strains
the ipma was used to examine the reactivity of mab 8e <dig> with six different pcv <dig> strains and recpcv1/g. the pcv2-positive serum stained all the pcv <dig> strains , whereas the pcv1-positive serum stained the recpcv1/g antigen. mab 8e <dig> stained pcv2a/lg, pcv2a/cl and pcv2a/jf <dig> antigens, and did not stain pcv2b/sh, pcv2b/yj, pcv2b/jf antigens  or the recpcv1/g antigen.

a serum neutralization assay was used to determine the neutralizing activity of mab 8e <dig>  8e <dig> possessed neutralizing activity for pcv2a/lg, pcv2a/cl and pcv2a/jf <dig>  figure 3b shows the percentage neutralization of 8e <dig> against different pcv <dig> strains and recpcv1/g. a mab was considered to be neutralizing when its mean neutralizing activity was > 50%. mab 8e <dig> that reacted equally with three pcv2a strains in ipma demonstrated neutralization of pcv2a/lg , pcv2a/cl  and pcv2a/jf- <dig> . however, mab 8e <dig> did not neutralize the other three pcv2b strains or recpcv1/g.

a capture elisa was used to determine whether mab 8e <dig> reacted with virions of different pcv <dig> strains. among the six pcv <dig> strains, three  produced a positive signal , whereas pcv2b/sh, pcv2b/yj, pcv2b/jf and recpcv1/g produced a negative signal  .

analysis of orf <dig> from different pcv <dig> strains
the similarity of the capsid proteins of six different strains used in this study was determined using pairwise alignments and the clustal w method. there was high amino acid identity of the capsid protein among isolates of pcv2a  and pcv2b  respectively, while there was only 88% -  <dig> % amino acid identity of the capsid protein between pcv2a and pcv2b . on the basis of the alignment shown in figure  <dig>  five regions  were chosen for construction of pcv2-orf2-cl/yj chimeras that included amino acids that differed between them.

the percentage amino acid identities given are the result of pairwise alignments of the capsid proteins. percentage identities between the pcv2a strains are shown in bold; percentage identities between the pcv2b strains are shown in bold and italics; percentage identities between the pcv2a and 2b strains are underlined.

reactivity of different pcv <dig> infectious clones with pcv2-positive serum and mab 8e4
the ipma reactivity of pcv2-positive serum with clones pcv2a/cl , pcv2b/yj , pcv2a/lg  and pcv2a/jf <dig>  is shown in figure  <dig>  at a dilution of 1: <dig>  pcv2-positive serum recognized the antigens produced by all four clones and thus served as a positive transfection control. however, mab 8e <dig> did not react with the antigen produced by clone ryj-orf <dig> . these results demonstrated that mab 8e <dig> reacted with the capsid protein of pcv2a , but not pcv2b/yj.

reactivity of chimeras with pcv2-positive serum and mab 8e4
to identify the antigenic sites  on the capsid protein of pcv <dig>  four pcv2-orf2-cl/yj chimeras and one mutant were constructed in which the five regions of pcv2a/cl-orf <dig> were replaced with the corresponding regions of pcv2b/yj-orf <dig> . the ipma reactivity of these chimeras with pcv2-positive serum and mab 8e <dig> is shown in figure 1a. pcv2-positive serum reacted strongly with all of the chimeras. mab 8e <dig>  which recognized the pcv2a/cl capsid protein, reacted with chimeras rcl-yj- <dig>  rcl-yj- <dig>  rcl-yj- <dig> and rcl-yj- <dig>  but not with rcl-yj- <dig> . when residues 47- <dig> of pcv2a/cl-orf <dig> in chimera rcl-yj- <dig> were replaced with those of pcv2b/yj-orf <dig>  mab 8e <dig> lost its reactivity with the rcl-yj- <dig> chimeric capsid protein. this indicates that aa 47- <dig> are important for the recognition of mab 8e <dig> 

reactivity of mutants with pcv2-positive serum and mab 8e4
to identify the antigenic sites recognized by mab 8e <dig> on the capsid protein of pcv2a/cl further, four pcv2-orf2-cl/yj mutants , in which the amino acids  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of pcv2a/cl-orf <dig> were replaced, respectively, with the corresponding amino acid of pcv2b/yj-orf <dig>  were constructed . the reactivity of pcv2-positive serum and mab 8e <dig> to these mutants in the ipma is summarized in figure 1b. pcv2-positive serum produced strong signals with all of the mutants, which indicates that the mutants are infectious and can replicate in pk- <dig> cells. mab 8e <dig> reacted strongly with mutants rcl-yj-1- <dig>  rcl-yj-1- <dig> and rcl-yj-1- <dig>  but did not react with rcl-yj-1- <dig> , in which alanine  at position  <dig> of pcv2a/cl-orf <dig> was replaced with arginine  of pcv2b/yj-orf <dig> 

in order to determine whether the amino acid residue a at position  <dig> is important for the binding of mab 8e <dig> to the capsid protein of the other two strains of pcv2a , two mutants  that contained a single mutation of a to r at position  <dig> in the capsid protein of pcv2a/lg-orf <dig> and pcv2a/jf2-orf <dig>  respectively, were constructed . the reactivity of pcv2-positive serum and mab 8e <dig> to these mutants in the ipma is summarized in figure 1c. pcv2-positive serum produced strong signals with the two mutants, whereas there was no reactivity with mab 8e <dig> .

another mutant was then generated in the pcv2/yj-orf <dig> background that contained a single mutation of r to a at position  <dig> of capsid protein . the pcv2-positive serum produced a strong signal with the mutant, however, mab 8e <dig> did not produce a positive reaction .

discussion
several studies have suggested that genetic differences in pcv <dig> are associated with the geographical region from which the isolates originated, and a classification system that has been proposed divides pcv <dig> into three genotypes ; a and b are the two major genotypes of pcv <dig>  <cit> , but c is only isolated in demark  <cit> . therefore, pcv2c was not used in the present study. until now, only one serotype has been identified among strains of pcv <dig>  however, mabs directed against pcv <dig>  have shown some differences in reactivity with different pcv <dig> strains  <cit> .

mab 8e <dig> generated in the present study reacted with pcv2a , by the ipma and capture elisa, and had the capacity to neutralize pcv2a . therefore, using mab 8e <dig>  three strains of pcv2a could be differentiated from three pcv2b strains. however, mab 8e <dig> did not give a positive reaction by western blot analysis. thus, the above results suggest that mab 8e <dig> recognizes a conformational epitope in the capsid protein of pcv <dig> 

there were several regions of diversity identified by alignment of the amino acid sequences of the capsid protein between pcv2a and pcv2b strains in the present study. the first  <dig> residues at the n terminus of the capsid protein are probably not involved in the formation of conformational epitopes. this region contains residues rich in basic amino acids and thus may be involved in the formation of the interior surface of the virion, and may interact with the negative charges of genomic dna during virus assembly, as reported for many icosahedral viruses  <cit> . amino acids from residue  <dig> to the c terminus within the capsid protein may be important for formation of pcv <dig> capsid protein. several epitopes in the pcv <dig> capsid protein that are involved in reactions with antibodies are also within this range  <cit> . therefore, five regions  were chosen for construction of pcv2-orf2-cl/yj chimeras that included amino acids that differed between pcv2a and pcv2b.

a chimera in which 230plkp <dig> of the c terminus of pcv2a/cl-cap was replaced by 230plnlne <dig> of the c terminus of the pcv2b/yj-cap was constructed to analyze whether elongation of the c terminus affected the conformational neutralizing epitope against mab 8e <dig>  elongation of the c terminus by two amino acids did not change the reactivity of mab 8e <dig> against pcv2a/cl in the ipma . furthermore, rjf2-orf <dig>  derived from pcv2a/jf <dig>  in which the c terminus was elongated by three amino acids, had the same reactivity with mab 8e <dig> as rcl-orf <dig> and rcl-yj- <dig> in the ipma .

in previous studies, analysis of the reactivity of pcv1/pcv <dig> chimeras has suggested that the amino acid sequences from aa 47- <dig> and 165- <dig>  as well as the last four c-terminal amino acids of the capsid protein, are likely to be in close proximity and may form a cluster of conformational epitopes on the surface of the pcv <dig> virion  <cit> . in the present study, the replacement of an amino acid residue  in the capsid protein altered the reaction of pcv2a  with mab 8e <dig>  therefore, it could be concluded that the alanine at position  <dig> was a critical amino acid in the conformational neutralizing epitope recognized by mab 8e <dig>  alanine is a nonpolar hydrophobic amino acid with a molecular weight  of  <dig> da, whereas arginine is a polar basic hydrophilic amino acid with a mw of  <dig>  due to the differences in size, charge and hydrophobicity between alanine and arginine, this may have major consequences on the secondary and tertiary structure of the pcv <dig> capsid protein. therefore, it could be concluded that the replacement of an amino acid residue  in the capsid protein of pcv2a  disrupted the binding of mab 8e <dig> completely. furthermore, the amino acid at position  <dig> is located on loop bc of the capsid protein  <cit> . this loop together with loop de and hi are on the exterior surface of the pcv <dig> to form the highest protrusion  <cit> . therefore, this position may be more easily recognized by b cell receptor and with a high possibility to become a conformational b cell epitope.

it was confirmed that another mutant , which contained a single amino acid mutation of r to a at position  <dig>  did not have the ability to react with mab 8e <dig>  we suggest that the amino acid at position  <dig> of capsid protein is a necessary but not sufficient residue for epitope recognition by mab 8e <dig>  the 3d structure of capsid protein and mab 8e <dig> complex should be studied to gain full knowledge of the conformational epitope against mab 8e <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, a mab  with neutralizing activity could be used to differentiate pcv2a strains  from other pcv2b strains . these results confirm that there are antigenic differences among pcv <dig> strains  <cit> . furthermore, reverse genetics were used to explore the genetic basis of the different reactions of pcv2a/cl and pcv2b/yj with mab 8e <dig>  evidence is presented that the amino acid at position  <dig> of pcv2a  capsid proteins is a critical amino acid in the conformational neutralizing epitope recognized by mab 8e <dig>  this study may provide valuable information for further in-depth mapping of the conformational neutralizing epitope, understanding antigenic difference among pcv <dig> strains, and development of a useful vaccine for control of pcv2-associated disease.
