BACKGROUND
type  <dig> diabetes and cushing's syndrome have similar phenotypes, including visceral obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance  <cit> . in the case of cushing's syndrome, the patients have elevated circulating glucocorticoids whereas patients with type  <dig> diabetes have normal circulating levels but higher intracellular levels  <cit> . the concentration of active glucocorticoids  formed at the cellular level is regulated by the degree of reductase activity of the 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  type  <dig> enzyme  <cit> .

glucocorticoids have been shown to decrease the levels of adiponectin in animal models  <cit>  and in humans  <cit> . adiponectin is a hormone secreted exclusively from adipose tissue  <cit> , the concentrations of which are positively correlated with a favorable metabolic phenotype in humans  <cit> . it circulates in serum as a basic trimer, a hexamer, and larger multimeric structures  <cit> . the full-length protein influences hepatic gluconeogenesis whilst the globular domain of adiponectin stimulates β-oxidation in muscle. these effects are mediated by the adipor <dig>  and adipor <dig>  receptors respectively  <cit> . recently it was shown that the appl <dig> adaptor protein binds to the intracellular domain of adiponectin receptors and confers some of adiponectin's actions  <cit> , and thus may be an important mediator of adiponectin-dependent insulin sensitization in skeletal muscle. the mrna expression of adiponectin is reduced in adipose tissue in obese mice and humans  <cit>  although the picture differs somewhat depending on fat depot. adiponectin is not only decreased in obese individuals but also in type  <dig> diabetic patients  <cit>  and a low level is a risk factor for developing this disease  <cit> . physiological doses of adiponectin improve insulin sensitivity in db/db and kkay mice, two mouse models of type  <dig> diabetes, partly by decreasing triglycerides  in liver and muscle tissue  <cit> . treatment with thiazolidinediones increases the expression and secretion of adiponectin in both rodents and humans  <cit> , indicating that changes in this adipokine may be integral to the therapeutic effects of thiazolidinediones  <cit> .

transgenic mice overexpressing 11β hsd1-selectively in adipose tissue develop type  <dig> diabetes and visceral obesity  <cit> , in contrast to the 11β hsd <dig> knockout mouse, which displays a favorable phenotype with normoglycemia and normal weight  <cit> . this animal resists diet-induced obesity, has improved glucose and insulin tolerance and demonstrates favorable changes in cytokine expression, including a doubling in adiponectin. another transgenic mouse overexpressing hsd type  <dig> in adipose tissue, and thereby inhibiting corticosterone exposure intracellularly, also had higher expression of adiponectin than its wild type counterparts when fed a high fat diet  <cit> . various inhibitors of 11β hsd <dig> have been disclosed, with multiple favourable effects on the metabolic phenotype. in addition to increased insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance  <cit> , anti-obesity effects such as reduced food intake, body weight gain and reduced percentage body fat have been reported  <cit> . furthermore, atherosclerotic plaque lesions in apoe knockout mice were improved after treatment with 11β hsd <dig> inhibitors  <cit> . however, despite favourable effects on the insulin-sensitising adipokine adiponectin in genetic models of 11β hsd <dig> inhibition and corticosterone reduction, no such analysis has been reported in pharmacological models. substance bvt <dig> inhibited11β hsd <dig> in adipose tissue. it has good bioavailability  and low clearance, resulting in high cmax values  <cit> . when tested in c57bl <dig> mice, the compound displayed excellent pharmacodynamics in adipose tissue, inhibiting 11β hsd <dig> activity by 90%,  <dig> and  <dig> hours after dosing   <cit> . the aim of this study was to investigate if inhibition of 11β hsd <dig> in adipocytes with the specific inhibitor bvt <dig> affects the concentrations of adiponectin with concomitant impact on glucose homeostasis in diabetic mice. we compared the effects with bvt <dig>  <cit> , another 11β hsd <dig> inhibitor shown to exert its effects through alteration of glucose handling in the liver.

RESULTS
potency and pharmacodynamic activity of 11β hsd <dig> inhibitor bvt116429
bvt <dig> -2--1-ethylamino)-5-methyl-5-thiazol-4-one  is a potent reversible competitive inhibitor of human and mouse 11β hsd <dig> with >  <dig> fold selectivity over human 11β hsd <dig>  inhibitory constants derived from in vitro inhibition assays using purified recombinant mouse and human 11β hsd <dig> were  <dig> and  <dig> nm, respectively . representative data for human the enzyme is shown in figure  <dig>  bvt <dig> had no significant effect on a panel of  <dig> unrelated proteins and ion channels . to determine the effect of bvt <dig> in cells, human primary adipose cells were treated with increasing concentrations of compound and the ability of the cells to convert cortisone to cortisol was assessed using a cortisol elisa assay. repeated assays showed that bvt <dig> inhibited intracellular 11β hsd <dig> with an ic <dig> of  <dig> nm . to understand the degree of 11β hsd <dig> inhibition in liver from mice dosed with bvt <dig> at  <dig> mg/kg, the liver was excised  <dig> h post last dose, minced and exposed to cortisone ex vivo for  <dig> minutes. data showed that the compound inhibits conversion of cortisone to cortisol by 11β hsd <dig> in liver such that two hours post-dosing, liver 11β hsd <dig> activity was reduced by 35% . this contrast with the compounds greater effects in adipose tissue   <cit> . thus, bvt <dig> displays significant inhibitory activity against the enzyme in key target organs after oral dosing in c57/bl6j mice with especially high activity in adipose tissue.

effect of bvt <dig> treatment on plasma glucose
to test the effects of bvt <dig> on the diabetic phenotype of kkay mice, male mice were treated with compound for  <dig> days as described in the methods section. fasting glucose was reduced in animals treated with  <dig> mg/kg bvt <dig>  an effect that was comparable to that of rosiglitazone .

effect of bvt <dig> treatment on adiponectin in vivo and in vitro
different transgenic mouse models with altered 11β hsd <dig> activity or glucocorticoid concentrations demonstrate elevated adiponectin concentrations. for this reason, and considering the apparently greater effects of bvt <dig> on 11β hsd <dig> activity in adipose tissue, we measured adiponectin in kkay mice treated with bvt <dig>  total adiponectin levels were elevated in kkay mice after treatment with both bvt <dig>  and rosiglitazone compared with control . in view of recent findings that the distribution of different adiponectin complexes is critical in determining insulin sensitivity  <cit> , we decided to investigate the complex composition of adiponectin in serum from the kkay mice. the most prominent adiponectin complex in kkay mice was the hexamer . both the hexameric and the high molecular weight  multimeric forms were increased after treatment with bvt <dig>  and rosiglitazone . in order to understand the mechanistic interplay between 11β hsd <dig> inhibition and a concomitant increase of adiponectin levels better, we studied human primary adipocytes in culture. terminally differentiated human adipocytes were treated with bvt <dig> for  <dig> hours in the presence of cortisone. adiponectin concentrations released into the culture medium increased by  <dig> -fold, from  <dig>  ng/ml in the absence of compound to  <dig>  ng/ml in its presence . thus, inhibition of 11β hsd <dig> activity in adipocytes is able to increase adiponectin production, suggesting that the effect seen in intact mice is a direct one on the adipose mass.

effect of bvt <dig> on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity
glucose excursions after a glucose challenge in ogtt were not altered by either rosiglitazone or bvt <dig>  indicating no effect on glucose tolerance in these animals . the insulin curve is shown in figure 7b. basal plasma insulin level was decreased for both rosiglitazone  and bvt <dig>  compared with vehicle  indicating increased insulin sensitivity already after seven days of treatment.

to examine more specifically the effects of bvt <dig> on insulin sensitivity, an insulin tolerance test was performed in male kkay mice. animals were treated with bvt <dig> for seven days prior to the test. after an overnight fast, animals were given an intraperitoneal bolus of insulin  and blood glucose was followed for two hours. when fitted to a single exponential equation, the glucose elimination rate constant  were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . the apparent increased elimination rate constant did not however show statistical significance .

euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp
to examine the effects of bvt <dig> at the level of the liver more specifically, a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp was performed in male kkay mice. animals were treated once daily with  <dig> mg/kg bvt <dig> or vehicle for eight days, starting three days after surgery to implant a catheter in the right jugular vein. after a  <dig> hour fast, the clamp was performed as described in the methods section. bvt <dig> had no effect on hepatic glucose production. basal endogenous glucose production was  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , and after insulin infusion  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , for vehicle and bvt <dig> respectively.

effect on food intake, body weight and leptin
there were no differences in food intake between different treatment groups over the  <dig> day treatment period . the group of rosiglitazone treated animals was the only group that gained weight during the study . to determine the proportion of fat in the animals, fat pads were dissected and weighed and normalized to the whole body weight . the data showed no significant changes in fat mass after treatment with bvt <dig> or rosiglitazone. in a separate experiment, body composition was determined by dual energy x-ray absorptimetry to take total body fat into account instead of epididymal fat alone. these results showed that there were no significant change in total body adiposity after treatment with bvt <dig> compared to vehicle . by contrast, animals treated with rosiglitazone showed increased adiposity to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % . as expected, the leptin level was elevated for the rosiglitazone group compared with the vehicle group . the highest dose group of bvt <dig>  had higher leptin levels than the control group despite no significant changes in total body adiposity.

data are mean ± sem, n =  <dig> per group. *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig>  and ***p <  <dig>  significantly different from vehicle

effect on plasma and liver lipids
total plasma cholesterol was elevated in animals treated with rosiglitazone compared with the control group, and this was accompanied by elevated plasma hdl-cholesterol and lowered cholesterol in the liver , but no effects were seen with bvt <dig> 

effects of the 11βhsd <dig> inhibitor bvt <dig> on adiponectin concentrations
to assess the effects of a second 11β hsd <dig> inhibitor, bvt <dig>  on plasma adiponectin concentrations, male kkay mice were treated with three different doses of the compound twice daily for  <dig> days, as described in the methods section. analysis of the plasma samples showed that bvt <dig> had no significant effect on adiponectin concentrations . by contrast, rosiglitazone again caused significant increases in plasma adiponectin. analysis of plasma hba1c concentrations showed that the treatment with bvt <dig> reduced hba1c significantly at  <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg, confirming its expected anti-hyperglycemic effects .

discussion
patients with type  <dig> diabetes have high intracellular levels of glucocorticoids  <cit> . the level is regulated by 11β hsd <dig> and inhibition of this enzyme in the adipose tissue is one possible novel way of treating type  <dig> diabetes. in contrast to their wild type siblings, 11β hsd <dig> -/- mice lack mrna for 11β hsd <dig> and cannot convert 11-dehydrocorticosterone to active corticosterone  <cit> . when these mice were fed a high fat diet, blood glucose concentrations were lower compared with wild type animals. indeed, 11β hsd <dig> -/- mice fed a high fat diet do not become hyperglycemic. morton et al studied 11β hsd <dig> -/- mice with a focus on lipid metabolism and reported lower plasma triglyceride levels compared with wild type animals  <cit> . the same group studied mrna expression of leptin and adiponectin in epididymal fat of 11β hsd <dig> -/- mice and saw decreased leptin and increased adiponectin  <cit> . kershaw et al created a transgenic model in which human 11β hsd <dig> was expressed under the control of the murine adipocyte fatty acid binding protein promoter and thereby increased 11β hsd <dig> expression and activity exclusively in adipose tissue, resulting in a phenotype with less glucocorticoid in adipose tissue due to enhanced inactivation of corticosterone. this model displayed increased expression of adiponectin in subcutaneous adipose tissue, when fed a high fat diet compared with wild type  <cit> . this is in accordance with the report of masuzaki et al which describes transgenic mice overexpressing 11β hsd <dig> in adipose tissue with decreased adiponectin expression in mesenteric fat  <cit> . mesenteric fat was increased nearly four times in this animal and expression of mrna of adiponectin was decreased to 42% compared to non-transgenic mice. transgenic mice also had reduced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, measured by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests and insulin tolerance tests, compared to non-transgenic mice.

thus these three animal models implicate an association between glucocorticoid dynamics in adipose tissue and adiponectin expression. in the present study, we show that treatment with the specific 11β hsd <dig> inhibitor bvt <dig>  increases adiponectin concentrations, both in adipocytes and, quantitatively and qualitatively, in serum. this is in accordance with other studies where glucocorticoid is reported to inhibit both expression and secretion of adiponectin  <cit> . adiponectin is an activator of amp activated protein kinase  which is proposed to be a metabolic master switch  <cit> . activation of ampk is supposed to lead to improved glucose and fat metabolism including increased glucose uptake in muscle, increased insulin sensitivity, increased ffa uptake and oxidation and repressed lipogenesis  <cit> . interestingly some of these ameliorations are achieved by treatment with bvt <dig>  in this study we show that treatment with the specific 11β hsd <dig> inhibitor bvt <dig>  improves the glucose homeostasis in diabetic kkay mice. fasting blood glucose was lowered by approximately 25%  after ten days and plasma insulin was reduced already after seven days of treatment. unfortunately the itt did not show any significant differences in insulin sensitivity between the groups, probably due to a combination of groups of too few animals in which insulin resistance varies substantially, and a varied response to the experimental dose of insulin. 11β hsd <dig> -/- mice have higher expression of uncoupling protein  <dig>  when fed high fat diet and this might be due to the elevated expression in adiponectin  <cit> . similar metabolic modifications were shown with another 11β hsd inhibitor, compound  <dig>  fasting serum glucose was lowered by 15% and insulin levels were normalised in diet induced obese mice after  <dig> days treatment  <cit> . the same group also reported decreased food intake and decreased body weight gain.

adiponectin is an important link between type  <dig> diabetes and vascular disease <cit> . kumada et al showed in their study in men that hypoadiponectinemia was associated with coronary artery disease prevalence even after adjustment for risk factors such as type  <dig> diabetes and body mass index  <cit> . adiponectin suppresses atherogenesis by inhibiting adherence of monocytes, reducing their phagocytic activity and suppressing accumulation of lipoproteins in the vascular wall  <cit> . hermanowski-vosatka et al  <cit>  showed that inhibition with compound  <dig>  another 11β hsd inhibitor, slowed plaque progression in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. we suggest that the beneficial results regarding atherosclerosis may be due, at least in part, to increased adiponectin. this study did not report on concentrations of adiponectin in 544-treated animals but we hypothesize that prolonged treatment with bvt <dig> will demonstrate similar effects due to elevations in circulating adiponectin.

our earlier 11β hsd <dig> inhibitor, bvt <dig>  has been shown to exert significant effects on feeding behavior and energy balance as well as glucose homeostasis in various animal models of glucose intolerance and type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> . thus, the compound has shown strong effects in the liver and possibly in the brain. our analysis here shows that bvt <dig> has no effect on plasma adiponectin concentrations, whilst bvt <dig> has no effects on the hepatic glucose production. these data indicate therefore that whilst inhibition of 11β hsd <dig> can be expected to be beneficial for treating the pathology of type  <dig> diabetes mellitus, all inhibitors are not the same, and different mechanistic effects can be expected with different compounds. the differences likely lie in the subtly different pharmacodynamics exerted by the compounds in different tissues in the body. thus bvt <dig>  which has strong effects in the liver, likely regulates glucose homeostasis in this organ, whilst bvt <dig> has less effect in the liver but upregulates the major insulin sensitizing adipokine adiponectin, due to its greater effects in the adipose tissue.

CONCLUSIONS
in our study we have treated an animal model of type  <dig> diabetes with an 11β hsd <dig> inhibitor bvt <dig> for up to ten days and obtained several ameliorations of the diabetic phenotype, specifically lowered plasma glucose, which is the most important clinical chemistry parameter to improve. ten days is a relatively short treatment time and a longer treatment could possibly lead to further improvements such as improved dyslipidemia. increases in adiponectin concentrations may be an integral component in the mechanism of action of 11β hsd <dig> inhibitors which are active in the adipose tissue and may be a useful marker of efficacy during the clinical development of inhibitory compounds. this approach to the treatment of type  <dig> diabetes might also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
