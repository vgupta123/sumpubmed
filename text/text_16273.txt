BACKGROUND
in  <dig>  corynebacterium aurimucosum was taxonomically described as new species within the genus corynebacterium, with c. minutissimum as the nearest phylogenetic neighbour  <cit> . the phylogenetic and molecular taxonomic description was based on two isolates from human clinical specimens, one from an unknown source and one from blood cultures of a patient with bronchitis. c. aurimucosum is a non-lipophilic species, and growth is facultatively anaerobic. on columbia blood agar colonies are generally slightly yellow in colour  <cit> . the isolation of c. aurimucosum from other human clinical sources has been reported, although very rarely. c. aurimucosum was detected in samples from patients with acute or chronic joint or bone infections  <cit> , in infected diabetic foot wounds  <cit>  and in a biopsy sample from a patient with rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> . furthermore, c. aurimucosum 16s rdna was detected in a bacterial population collected in the entrance area of a clean room environment in the johnson space center  <cit>  and in dust samples taken from office rooms in buildings located in central finland  <cit> .

moreover, unusual charcoal-black-pigmented variants of c. aurimucosum were isolated in the u.s.a. and canada from female urogenital sources, mostly from vaginal and cervical swabs  <cit> . in  <dig>  shukla and co-workers reported the characterization of strain cn- <dig>  that was isolated from a vaginal swab of a 34-year-old female who experienced a spontaneous abortion during month six of pregnancy  <cit> . subsequently, additional isolates with similar phenotypic and genotypic characteristics were recovered from the genital tract of women who had complications during pregnancy  <cit> , suggesting that this newly recognized corynebacterium might be an opportunistic pathogen in pregnant women  <cit> . according to their black pigmentation, the name corynebacterium nigricans was proposed for these isolates, and cn- <dig> was selected as type strain of this species  <cit> . however, morphological and biochemical analyses and sequencing of 16s rrna genes in a polyphasic study of black-pigmented coryneform bacteria from the centers for disease control and prevention  group fcg <dig> suggested that c. nigricans is a later synonym for c. aurimucosum  <cit> .

in this study, we present the complete genome sequence and bioinformatics analysis of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig>  to obtain insights into the physiology and lifestyle of this potential urogenital pathogen. strain cn- <dig> was originally isolated from a female who presented with the sudden onset of premature labor during month six of gestation. the medical history of the patient was unremarkable, but the fetus died during vaginal delivery. a vaginal sample was taken at the time of delivery and revealed moderate growth of a black-pigmented corynebacterium in conjunction with other normal vaginal flora  <cit> .

RESULTS
pyrosequencing and annotation of the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> genome
the complete genome sequence of the clinical isolate c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> was determined by combining a whole-genome shotgun approach performed by pyrosequencing with a whole-genome scaffold generated by fosmid technology . a single run with the genome sequencer flx system yielded  <dig>  reads and a total number of  <dig> , <dig> bases that were assembled into  <dig> large  contigs. these assembled dna sequences  were combined with  <dig> sanger reads performed on selected fosmid clones that covered the gaps between  <dig> chromosomal contigs. the resulting assembly of the dna sequence data into a circular chromosome of  <dig> , <dig> bp was consistent with the whole-genome scaffold deduced from  <dig> terminal insert sequences of randomly selected fosmid clones , corroborating the accuracy of the assembly process that was guided by the consed program  <cit> . the gaps between the three remaining contigs  were bridged by pcr, resulting in a circular contig of  <dig>  bp in length. this assembled dna sequence represents an endogenous plasmid of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig>  named pet <dig> . the average gap size between the  <dig> chromosomal contigs was  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp between the three plasmid contigs. considering the final size of the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> genome, a 49-fold coverage was initially obtained by pyrosequencing. relevant data of the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> genome project are summarized in table  <dig> 

1abbreviation: clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats

the circular chromosome of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> has a size of  <dig> , <dig> bp and a mean g+c content of  <dig> % , which is slightly below the value of  <dig> % that was previously determined by high-performance liquid chromatography  <cit> . gene prediction and annotation of the genome sequence were performed with the gendb system  <cit>  and resulted in the detection of  <dig>  protein-coding regions on the c. aurimucosum chromosome. on plasmid pet <dig>  twenty protein-coding sequences and eight pseudogenes were detected . furthermore,  <dig> trna genes were found by the trnascan-se program  <cit> , and four rrn operons were identified on the leading strands of the c. aurimucosum chromosome, one on the right and three on the left replichore.

general architecture of the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> genome: moderate chromosomal reorganization in the main lineage of the genus corynebacterium
the calculation of the g/c skew   <cit>  indicated a bi-directional replication mechanism of the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> chromosome . the origin of replication  was detected with ori-finder, a web-based tool for oric prediction in bacterial genomes  <cit> . according to the presence and distribution of seven conserved dnaa boxes , the oric is located downstream of the dnaa  coding region and has a computed length of  <dig> bp. the calculated g/c skew additionally indicated the presence of a putative dif region involved in replication termination  <cit>  at the expected position of 180° from oric, dividing the chromosome of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> in two replichores of similar size . for a more precise detection of a potential dif region, the distribution of the architecture imparting sequences gggggga and gggggag  <cit>  was plotted on the leading and lagging strands of the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> chromosome . these octamers are present in  <dig> copies on the leading strands and in only  <dig> copies on the lagging strands of the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> chromosome. this characteristic distribution pattern of architecture imparting sequences revealed a putative dif region at around  <dig>  kb of the chromosomal map . in accordance with this result, the respective dna region of the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> chromosome contains a 28-bp sequence that showed striking similarity to the consensus sequence of actinobacterial dif sites  <cit>  .

synteny analysis by reciprocal best matches with blastp  <cit>  revealed a conserved order of orthologous genes between the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> chromosome and other pathogenic corynebacteria, in particular with c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig> displaying two breakpoints of synteny at  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb of the c. aurimucosum chromosomal map . the comparison between the gene order of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> and c. jeikeium k <dig>  c. urealyticum dsm <dig> and c. kroppenstedtii dsm <dig> revealed additional breakpoints in the chromosomal organization , which is consistent with the taxonomic position of the latter three species that are part of independent branches in the phylogenetic tree of the genus corynebacterium  <cit> . the two breakpoints of synteny between the chromosomes of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> and c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig> are indicative of a symmetric inversion of a 239-kb chromosomal dna segment  around the terminus of replication. the detected inversion in the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> chromosome provides the first example of a moderate genetic reorganization in genomes of members from the main lineage of the genus corynebacterium, since all hitherto completely sequenced genomes  displayed an overall synteny of their gene order  <cit> .

due to the symmetric inversion around the terminus of the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> chromosome, the preferential location of the respective genes on either the leading or lagging strands and their distance from the terminus region remained conserved after the chromosomal reorganization  <cit> . in general, 61% of the predicted c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> genes are located on the leading strands of both replichores, while 39% are encoded on the lagging strands. it has been suggested that essentiality is the driving force for such type of gene-strand bias in bacterial genomes  <cit> . to detect candidate essential genes in the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> genome, the predicted gene repertoire was compared with that of c. glutamicum strain r  <cit> , as genes shared by multiple genomes are more likely to be essential  <cit> . in addition, a high-density transposon mutagenesis approach in c. glutamicum r had already revealed  <dig> candidate essential genes in this strain, using complex medium and standard laboratory conditions for the selection of transposon mutants  <cit> . this number of candidate essential genes obviously represents an overestimate, at least due to polar effects caused by some transposon insertions  <cit> . the comparative genomics approach detected  <dig> coding regions of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> with high similarity to candidate essential genes from c. glutamicum r. among this set of candidate essential genes,  <dig> % are located on the leading strands of the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> chromosome, while  <dig> % are encoded on the lagging strands, which is consistent with the aforementioned interpretation of gene-strand bias in bacterial genomes  <cit> .

the annotation of the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> chromosome revealed the presence of two putative prophages. this observation is consistent with the lack of homology of the respective chromosomal region to the genomes of other pathogenic corynebacteria  and with a lack of synteny when compared with the genome sequence of c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig> . the first prophage-like region  was detected adjacent to trnaleu and trnagln genes of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> that may represent the integration site of ϕcaurii. this genome region has a size of about  <dig>  kb and encodes  <dig> genes . the second prophage-like region  is located directly adjacent to ϕcaurii and comprises  <dig> genes  with a size of about  <dig>  kb. both prophage regions contain at their 3' ends genes encoding λ repressor-like transcription regulators  and phage-related integrases . almost all genes of the prophage regions, with the exception of the regulatory genes, are encoded on the leading strand of the left replichore of the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> chromosome . the size difference between both prophage regions suggests that at least ϕcaurii is incomplete and a defective remnant of a formerly active corynephage.

beside that, we detected with the crisprfinder program  <cit>  an array of  <dig> clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats  and seven crispr-associated  genes  in the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> chromosome. the dna repeats are  <dig> bp in length, separated by 33-bp spacers with variable nucleotide sequences and similar to repeat units of crisprs from c. jeikeium k <dig>  <cit> , c. urealyticum dsm <dig>  <cit>  and nocardia farcinica ifm  <dig>  <cit> . crispr arrays and associated cas genes may provide acquired immunity against bacteriophages and other foreign genetic elements, with a specificity that is determined by sequence similarities between the spacers and foreign dna sequences  <cit> .

specific features of the carbohydrate metabolism of c. aurimucosum atcc 700975: catabolism of aromatic amines and utilization of l-tartrate
the metabolic analysis of the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> genome was performed with the computer program carmen that provided an automatic mapping of genome annotations on manually curated metabolic pathway maps  <cit> . these data were combined with results from a comparative genomics approach performed with the bioinformatics tool edgar, resulting in the detection of orthologous genes in different corynebacterial genomes and their classification as core genes or species-specific genes, so-called singletons  <cit> . a comparison of the gene content of pathogenic corynebacteria revealed a putative core genome consisting of  <dig>  genes that are common in c. aurimucosum, c. diphtheriae, c. jeikeium, c. urealyticum, and c. kroppenstedtii. this value is very similar to data deduced previously from the comparison of gene contents in pathogenic and non-pathogenic corynebacteria  <cit> . the comparative genome analysis with edgar revealed also that c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> contains  <dig> genes that are specific for this chromosome. the functional evaluation of the detected singletons provided characteristic features of the metabolism and lifestyle of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> that are described in more detail below. as the specific gene repertoire of a bacterium should in principle be shaped by the environmental conditions in the natural habitat and as we observed similarities to the gene repertoire of gut microbes, the annotation data point towards the human gut as a natural source for c. aurimucosum strains, which is consistent with the recent single report of a detection of this organism in a human fecal sample  <cit> .

analysis of the central carbohydrate metabolism of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> revealed the complete gene set for glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway . the chromosome of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> provides a phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  and a fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase  function for gluconeogenesis. the anaplerotic reaction of the tricarboxylic acid  cycle is mediated by pyruvate carboxylase . in contrast to other sequenced pathogenic corynebacteria that all lack the succd genes coding for succinyl-coa synthetase, the tca cycle of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> is complete . it has been suggested that a putative succinyl-coa:coa transferase encoded by the cat <dig> gene can replace the missing succinyl-coa synthetase activity in pathogenic corynebacteria  <cit> . besides succd , the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> chromosome also carries the respective cat <dig> gene . on the other hand, the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> genome lacks the aceab genes for the glyoxylate bypass within the tca cycle. the lack of aceab was previously also observed in the genome sequence of c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig>  <cit> .

the functional analysis of singletons in the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> genome sequence resulted in the detection of a distinct gene cluster for the uptake and degradation of aromatic amines  . c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> can apparently take up aromatic amines by a specific permease encoded by hpax. the subsequent transformation into ammonia and the corresponding aromatic acid is catalyzed by amine oxidase  and phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase . the resulting metabolite is converted into pyruvate and succinic semialdehyde via the homoprotocatechuate  meta-cleavage degradation route . the hpa gene cluster encoding the respective enzymes of this pathway consists of seven genes . the gabd <dig> gene is required for the enzymatic dehydrogenation of succinic semialdehyde to succinate that can enter the tca cycle . the hpaf function necessary to convert 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxy-muconic acid  into 5-oxo-pent-3-ene- <dig> ,5-tricarboxylic acid  is encoded elsewhere in the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> chromosome . two regulatory genes  are apparently involved in controlling the expression of the hpc meta-cleavage pathway and the uptake and conversion of aromatic amines. the hpa gene cluster of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> is similar to a previously reported cluster for the uptake and degradation of aromatic acids in e. coli  <cit>  . aromatic compounds may constitute a carbon source for gut microbes, as they are not only abundant in soil and water, but are also present in the gastrointestinal tract, where they mostly derive from plant constituents. as the hpc  <dig> -dioxygenase  requires molecular oxygen, utilization of the hpc meta-cleavage pathway is restricted to distinct intestinal habitats, for instance ones in close proximity to epithelial cells, where oxygen molecules might pass from the blood to the microbes attached to the epithelium  <cit> . accordingly, c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> is probably able to utilize aromatic amines as carbon and energy sources when living in an aerobic environment, such as the peripheral areas of the human gut system.

furthermore, the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> chromosome contains three singletons  that are involved in the uptake and degradation of l-tartrate . uptake of l-tartrate is mediated by a tartrate/succinate antiporter encoded by yfls. the subsequent degradation to oxaloacetate is catalyzed by an  l-tartrate dehydratase . the respective gene cluster is homologous to previously described genes from e. coli  <cit> . tartaric acid is found in many fruits and vegetables and is also a product of microbial metabolism in the gut ecosystem that enhances the ability of the normal gut microflora to reduce the intestinal colonization by salmonella species and other enteropathogens  <cit> . l-tartrate is the most widely distributed isomer and can be degraded under aerobic and anaerobic conditions by a variety of bacteria  <cit> . however, e. coli can utilize l-tartrate only as reducible substrate for supporting anaerobic growth on the oxidizable co-substrate glycerol  <cit> . the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> chromosome also encodes a transporter for the uptake of glycerol  as well as glycerol-3-phosphate , gluconate  and lactate  transporters . furthermore, five genes coding for components of the bacterial phosphotransferase system  and two additional enzyme ii genes  encoding proteins of the fructose, glucose and glucoside families of pts permeases  <cit>  were identified in the chromosome of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> . this gene repertoire, associated with the central metabolism of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig>  suggested that this bacterium is very flexible in the utilization of different carbon and energy sources, under both aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions.

specific features of the amino acid metabolism of c. aurimucosum atcc 700975: l-histidine catabolism and utilization of selenocysteine in formate dehydrogenase
according to the genome annotation, all known pathways for the biosynthesis of standard proteinogenic amino acids are present in the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> chromosome. the detection of singletons with edgar revealed that c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> encodes a complete histidine utilization  pathway for the conversion of histidine to glutamate . four gene products are directly involved in histidine catabolism: the first reaction is catalyzed by histidine ammonia-lyase , followed by the conversion of the resulting urocanate to 4-imidazolone-5-propanoate via urocanate hydratase . the next catabolic step generates n-formimidoyl-l-glutamate by imidazolonepropionase  that is finally hydrolyzed into l-glutamate and formamide by formimidoylglutamase . similar gene regions are known from saprophytic bacteria, such as pseudomonas species, that take up and utilize l-histidine when growing in the plant environment  <cit>  .

regarding the proposal of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> as urogenital pathogen in pregnant women, it is interesting to note that the female histidine metabolism is affected during pregnancy, resulting in the excretion of large amounts of histidine in the urine  <cit> . histidine excretion is largely dependent on the composition of the diet and is generally higher during the second half of gravidity  <cit> . although little information regarding the utilization by bacteria of l-histidine from human sources is available, the human gut microbe fusobacterium varium was shown to use l-histidine as carbon source for growth  <cit> . according to the presence of a complete hut pathway, c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> is apparently able to utilize l-histidine as carbon and/or nitrogen source, which might be beneficial for bacterial growth when colonizing the urogenital tract of pregnant women.

moreover, the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> chromosome contains the selabd genes and the trnasec gene selc for the synthesis of the twenty-first proteinogenic amino acid selenocysteine  and its incorporation into selenoproteins . selenocysteine is specifically incorporated into proteins by a cotranslational process that is directed by the uga stop codon and termed recoding  <cit> . the first step during selenocysteine synthesis requires esterification of l-serine to the unique trnasec by l-seryl-trna synthetase . the seryl-trnasec is then converted to selenocysteyl-trnasec by selenocysteine synthetase , using selenophosphate as selenium donor, which in turn is synthesized by selenophosphate synthetase . the anticodon of the specific trnasec matches with an internal uga stop codon in mrnas from selenoprotein genes  <cit> . furthermore, a specific elongation factor encoded by selb  is required to recognize secis  elements in the mrna, such that the ribosome identifies the internal uga stop codon as codon for selenocysteine. translation of selenoprotein mrnas then ends at the next in-frame stop codon to give a full-size selenoprotein  <cit> .

interestingly, the fdng and fdxh genes  encoding subunits of a formate dehydrogenase are arranged in a cluster with coding regions for the synthesis and incorporation of selenocysteine . this gene order is highly conserved in bacterial genomes that code for the incorporation of selenocysteine into proteins. formate dehydrogenase is a heterogeneous group of enzymes that catalyze the decomposition of formate to carbon dioxide and contribute to mixed acid fermentation. some formate dehydrogenase enzymes can contain an intrinsic selenocysteine residue  <cit> . the fdng coding region of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> includes an internal uga stop codon, suggesting that a formate dehydrogenase of the selenoenzyme type is encoded by this dna region. the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> chromosome carries an additional gene for a standard  formate dehydrogenase  that is located adjacent to a putative formate transporter gene . the utilization of the selenoenzyme form of formate dehydrogenase may enhance the adaptability of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> to changing environments, due to the strikingly different ph-dependence when compared with thiol forms, with selenols being active at much lower ph  <cit> . this biochemical feature of selenoenzymes is remarkable when considering the lifestyle of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig>  since acidophilic lactobacilli create a low-ph environment in the human vagina by producing lactic acid  <cit> .

cell surface structures of c. aurimucosum atcc 700975: synthesis of a spah-type pilus and potential in biofilm formation
the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> genome codes for  <dig> proteins containing predicted signal peptides for either the general secretory  or the twin-arginine translocation  pathway for protein secretion. three secreted proteins of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> showed homology to subunits of the adhesive spah pilus from c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig>  <cit> . adhesive pili are covalently anchored to the corynebacterial cell wall by a transpeptidylation mechanism, requiring a c-terminal sorting signal with a conserved lpxtg motif  <cit> , and can mediate the adherence to host tissues and other bacterial cells  <cit> . the chromosome of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> contains two genes, srtd and srte , encoding putative sortases involved in the assembly of a spah-like pilus. the housekeeping sortase of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> is encoded elsewhere in the chromosome . the srtde genes of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> are part of a dna region also comprising the spahig genes  that encode surface-anchored proteins with c-terminal sorting motifs . these proteins showed similarity to fimbrial subunits from c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig> involved in the sortase-mediated formation of the spah pilus  <cit> . the spah protein represents the major pilin of this pilus type and, along with the minor pilin spai, forms the pilus shaft, whereas the spag protein is located at the tip of the pilus. according to the detected homology between the corynebacterial spahig proteins, it is likely that c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> expresses an adhesive pilus with structural similarity to the spah pilus of c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig> . this pilus structure can mediate the initial adhesion of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> to host tissues particularly during vaginal infection and/or colonization  <cit> .

further analysis of the genome sequence revealed that c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> codes for a putative accumulation-associated protein . bioinformatics analysis displayed five g <dig> domains within the amino acid sequence of aap that can mediate the formation of biofilms by recognizing and binding to n-acetylglucosamines present in the peptidoglycan of the bacterial cell wall  <cit> . moreover, the c-terminal segment of aap contains a sorting motif  for anchoring of the protein to the corynebacterial cell wall. the secretion mechanism of aap remains unknown, as the protein is devoid of a typical signal peptide. the aap protein of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> is also characterized by a c-terminal multiple repeat unit of six amino acids , the number of which may vary among different isolates and during the course of an infection, as described for members of the biofilm-associated protein  family  <cit> . variations in the aap protein sequence may help the bacterium to evade the immune response of the host, as observed in the case of the alpha c protein of group b streptococci  <cit> . the aap protein of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> shares structural similarity with the biofilm-associated protein bap of staphylococcus aureus  <cit>  and the accumulation-associated protein aap of staphylococcus epidermidis  <cit> . both staphylococcal proteins are located on the cell surface and implicated in the formation of biofilms. cell aggregation and biofilm formation by aap requires proteolytic processing of the protein by endogenous or host-derived proteases  <cit> . in the latter case, host proteins can directly induce biofilm formation upon infection, thereby enabling the pathogen to evade the clearance by phagocytes. both the aap protein and the spah-type pilus apparently represent prominent protein factors on the surface of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> cells that are most likely involved in adhesion and colonization processes and in the formation of biofilms.

the gene repertoire of plasmid pet44827: synthesis of the characteristic black pigment of c. aurimucosum atcc 700975
assembly of the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> genome sequence revealed the presence of the endogenous plasmid pet <dig> . the average g+c content of  <dig> % is below the value of  <dig> % determined for the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> chromosome, indicating the acquisition of pet <dig> by horizontal gene transfer. coding regions displaying amino acid sequence similarities with proteins of known functions and providing information about structural features of pet <dig> and the physiological role of the deduced proteins are presented below.

replication of pet <dig> is presumably mediated by a replication initiator protein of the incw type  that showed 89% amino acid sequence identity to a homologous counterpart on the multiresistance plasmid ptp <dig> from c. striatum m82b  <cit> . this indicates that pet <dig> replicates by the theta mechanism, in contrast to other corynebacterial plasmids belonging to the png <dig> family that replicate via the rolling-circle mode  <cit> . additionally, pet <dig> encodes a putative resolvase  ensuring the stability of the plasmid during segregation. the putative resolvase of pet <dig> contains a conserved n-terminal catalytic domain of the serine recombinase family and a c-terminal dna binding domain  <cit> . however, the gcrr gene region lacks the typical dna sequence repeats described for the homologous resolvase gene of ptp <dig> from c. striatum m82b  <cit> . furthermore, pet <dig> encodes a putative relaxase encoded by traa with 52% similarity to the relaxase of plasmid prea <dig> from rhodococcus erythropolis an <dig>  <cit> . two genes located upstream of traa were identified as para and parb, showing similarity to class ib plasmid partitioning genes present on the png2-family plasmid ptet <dig> from c. glutamicum lp- <dig>  <cit> . therefore, pet <dig> seems to be an unusual corynebacterial plasmid that contains characteristic features of the png <dig> family that are combined with a replication initiator protein of the incw type.

the most prominent feature of pet <dig> is a region composed of five genes, including orf <dig> coding for a putative non-ribosomal peptide synthetase  . the g+c content of the nrps gene region is about 47%, which is below the mean value detected for pet <dig> . as the nrps gene region is flanked by a remnant of a transposase gene , it might have been integrated into the backbone of pet <dig> by a transpositional recombination event. the deduced gene product of orf <dig> shares 52% similarity with the single module type nrps bpsa from streptomyces lavendulae  <cit>  and 51% similarity with the nrps indc from the phytopathogen erwinia chrysanthemi  <cit> . both nrpss catalyze the modular synthesis of the blue  <dig> '-bipyridyl pigment indigoidine. the predicted nrps of pet <dig> comprises ten of the eleven highly conserved amino acid sequence motifs of nrps proteins, only lacking a typical n-terminal condensation domain. likewise, the indc protein from e. chrysanthemi does not contain a condensation domain, suggesting that the final condensation step in pigment synthesis is catalyzed by other proteins  <cit> . nrpss are key players in the synthesis of natural products and provide a modular assembly line by maintaining reaction intermediates covalently bound on the same phosphopantetheine prosthetic group  <cit> . nrpss are synthesized as apoforms, followed by activation through phophospantetheinlytransfer to generate the holoenzyme. this activation might be mediated by the gene products of orf <dig> and orf <dig>  encoding a protein with a phosphoribosyltransferase domain and a protein with homology to phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase from syntrophus aciditrophicus  <cit> , respectively. moreover, the nrps gene region of plasmid pet <dig> includes the coding region orf <dig> with deduced amino acid sequence similarity to inda from thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis, representing an uncharacterized protein involved in the pigment biosynthesis pathway of this species  <cit> . upstream of the nrps gene region, plasmid pet <dig> encodes a putative transcriptional regulator of the marr protein family , showing 53% similarity to the pecs regulatory protein from e. chrysanthemi  <cit> . interestingly, the pecs protein is a global regulator of various virulence factors and controls the production of the extracellular blue pigment of e. chrysanthemi  <cit> . according to this annotation of pet <dig> genes, it is most likely that the characteristic black pigment of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> is synthesized by the concerted action of the nrps encoded by orf <dig> and an unknown condensase function and that the black pigment molecule is relevant for the proposed pathogenicity of c. aurimucosum.

discussion
the annotation and bioinformatics analysis of the complete genome sequence of the clinical isolate c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig>  provides detailed insights into the metabolism and lifestyle of this bacterium. the most prominent features of c. aurimucosum strains from female urogenital sources are the unusual black pigmentation and their association with complications during pregnancy  <cit> . due to the black pigmentation and other phenotypic characteristics, these bacteria were initially named c. nigricans  <cit> , but were later shown to represent black-pigmented variants of c. aurimucosum  <cit> . annotation of the gene content of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> revealed a cluster of coding regions on plasmid pet <dig> that is probably involved in the synthesis of the black pigment. the protein encoded by orf <dig> showed similarity to the gene product of indc from the phytopathogenic bacterium e. chrysanthemi  <cit> . the indc gene of e. chrysanthemi codes for a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase that carries out the stepwise synthesis of the blue pigment indigoidine. reverchon et al. demonstrated that the production of indigoidine conferred an increased resistance to oxidative stress and enhanced the tolerance of e. chrysanthemi cells to external hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . the protection of the bacterial cells by indigoidine is probably based on common chemical properties of many pigment molecules that comprise several carbonate double bonds and can therefore act as efficient radical scavengers  <cit> . this protective function of a bacterial pigment might be relevant also for c. aurimucosum when colonizing the human vaginal tract.

the healthy human vaginal microflora is mostly dominated by acidophilic lactobacilli that play important roles in preventing disease, such as bacterial vaginosis, by creating a low-ph environment with a product of their metabolism, lactic acid, and by producing hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide by lactobacilli provides a major protection mechanism against opportunistic pathogens in the female genital tract  <cit> . hydrogen peroxide is toxic in two ways, firstly by producing toxic hydroxyl radicals and secondly by combining with the pool of chlorine ions in the vagina to generate chloridium ions  <cit> . hence, the colonization of the female genital tract by c. aurimucosum may depend on the efficient protection against cellular damage induced by external hydrogen peroxide. although the genome of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> contains a standard gene repertoire for defense against oxidative stress , efficient protection of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> cells against reactive oxygen species in the human vagina is additionally achieved by the synthesis of the typical black pigment that might act as radical scavenger. the location of the corresponding genes on plasmid pet <dig> explains why black-pigmented and non-pigmented c. aurimucosum strains were isolated from clinical specimens. remarkably, only black-pigmented strains were recovered from female genital sources, pointing towards the pivotal role of pigmentation for the colonization of the vaginal tract. however, when considering complications during pregnancy, such as bleeding, lactobacilli are less efficient in producing hydrogen peroxide, causing increased alkaline conditions in the vagina and thereby permitting the overgrowth of pathogenic microbes  <cit> . it would be interesting to screen non-pregnant women and sexually active men to see if some of them are colonized with this bacterium.

although corynebacterium species appeared to be present in the healthy human vaginal microflora  <cit>  and on the vaginal epithelium  <cit> , c. aurimucosum was hitherto not detected in specimens from the genital tract of healthy women. which pathway of vaginal, cervical and intrauterine infection by c. aurimucosum is therefore likely? information regarding the non-urogenital habitat of c. aurimucosum is currently based on only three reports:  three 16s rdna sequences were detected in specimens from the forearm skin of a healthy male, indicating that c. aurimucosum is part of the human skin biota  <cit> .  a single 16s rdna sequence was reported in the prostate fluid from a prostatitis patient  <cit> .  an apparently pigmented c. aurimucosum strain, originally named c. nigricans ae1- <dig>  was recovered from a fecal sample of a 35-year-old male japanese volunteer  <cit> . this isolation of c. aurimucosum from a fecal sample suggested that this species  may reside in the human intestine. the specific metabolic features of c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> deduced from the annotation of detected singletons corroborate this microbiological observation. c. aurimucosum may therefore gain access to the lower genital tract by contamination, followed by the so-called ascending pathway from the vagina and cervix, which is the most common route of intrauterine infections  <cit> . however, almost all of the black-pigmented variants of c. aurimucosum have been reported from urogenital sources suggesting that it may be the primary niche for this potential pathogen. indeed, its capability to  attach to mucosal surfaces through pili,  make biofilms, and  utilize aromatic compounds and l-histidine suggests that it is fully equipped to invade vaginal mucosa. when viewed in the context of its consistent isolation from pregnant women during complications of pregnancy, it is reasonable to assume that it plays an important role there.

in the gut ecosystem, aromatic amines and aromatic acids can be a frequent carbon and energy source for microbial growth when oxygen is available for the enzymatic ring cleavage reaction  <cit> . as oxygen molecules are present in close proximity to epithelial cells, where they pass from the blood through the epithelium, bacterial cells attached to the epithelium can assimilate such molecules and can thus benefit from the presence of oxygen  <cit> . the adherence of c. aurimucosum to epithelial cells is apparently mediated by a pilus structure of the spah type, consisting of the major pilin spah and the minor pilins spai and spag. adherence of c. diphtheriae to pharyngeal epithelial cells can be mediated also by the minor pilin spab of the structurally related spaabc pilus  <cit> . the spab protein is covalently anchored to the cell wall to provide tight contact between the bacterial cell and the host tissue in the absence of a pilus shaft. taking into consideration a similar functioning of the spai subunit of the spah pilus, adherence of c. aurimucosum cells to host tissue may also occur in the absence of a pilus shaft. adhesive pili can mediate the initial contact to host cell receptors, with cell-wall-linked pilins supporting the formation of an intimate zone of adhesion. this close contact between the bacterium and host cells enables additional ligand-receptor interactions and, in the case of pathogenic interactions, the efficient delivery of virulence factors  <cit> . furthermore, the adherence of c. aurimucosum to epithelial cells may result in the formation of biofilms. the cross-linking of bacterial cells can be mediated by the g <dig> domains of the accumulation-associated protein aap that is encoded on the c. aurimucosum atcc  <dig> chromosome and can probably interact with n-acetylglycosamine residues present in the peptidoglycan of the bacterial cell wall  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the annotation of the gene repertoire provides the attractive hypothesis to consider c. aurimucosum as resident of the human gut system that manages to reach the lower female genital tract and to establish in the vaginal environment as a contaminant. the close proximity of the vagina to the rectum raises the possibility of microbial colonization of the female genital tract in a continuous process  <cit> . another possibility is that black-pigmented strains are sexually transmitted from infected men to some women who engage in sex during pregnancy. indeed, a c. aurimucosum-like 16s rdna sequence has been reported from a prostatitis case  <cit> . further studies are necessary to confirm if c. aurimucosum is frequently found in sexually active men. when c. aurimucosum is equipped with appropriate protection mechanisms against the vaginal hydrogen peroxide produced by acidophilic lactobacilli, it can apparently establish in the vagina and cervix  <cit>  and probably ascend to the amniotic cavity and the fetus. bacterial infection by contamination is thereby followed by colonization that might cause distinct maternal or fetal responses  <cit> . the results of the c. aurimucosum genome project may help to clarify the proposed role of this bacterium as urogenital pathogen in pregnant women and to prevent preterm delivery that is a leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality in the u.s.a. and europe  <cit> . if the clinical diagnosis of c. aurimucosum infection and medical intervention is timely, the prognosis for pregnant women with urogenital infections caused by c. aurimucosum appears to be reasonably good, since several antibiotics turned out recently to be useful for the treatment of infections caused by this organism  <cit> .
