BACKGROUND
antimicrobial peptides  and peptide-related molecules are widespread in nature in organisms all along the phylogenetic scale, and are considered part of an ancestral innate system of defence against pathogen attack or competition for nutrients  <cit> . they are small peptides and proteins with common properties such as direct antimicrobial activity, abundance of cationic and hydrophobic residues, amphipathic conformations and diverse structures. synthetic amp have also been either designed de novo on the basis of these properties or identified by means of combinatorial and non-biased approaches. amp show great potential as alternatives to face the decreasing efficacy of conventional antibiotics in clinic  <cit> , new tools in plant protection  <cit> , or novel food preservatives  <cit> .

in contrast with the hundreds of peptides endowed with antimicrobial activity that are currently known, only a minor proportion of them have been studied in detail in relation to their mechanism of action. detailed knowledge of mode of action is critical to sustain the potential application of amp. it was initially considered that microbial killing was a primary consequence of the in vitro membrane disturbing properties shared by many cationic and amphipathic amp. nevertheless, today it is established for a number of peptides that there are also non-lytic modes of action that might involve specific interactions at cell envelopes and/or with intracellular targets, even among peptides known as potentially membrane-disrupting  <cit> . significant examples include: the binding of either the peptidic lantibiotic nisin  <cit>  or the amphipathic fungal defensin plectasin  <cit>  to the bacterial peptidoglycan precursor lipid ii; the requirement of plant defensins for the presence of distinct classes of membrane glycolipids  <cit> ; the interaction of different amp with heat shock related proteins  <cit> ; or the induction of dna damage and apoptosis  <cit> . also, cell penetrating properties are being discovered among peptides previously known as antimicrobials and, reversibly, some penetrating-like peptides show antimicrobial potency  <cit> .

genome-wide techniques and transcriptional profiles have contributed to the characterization of amp mechanisms  <cit> . the underlying assumption is that these studies will provide non-biased clues to the mode of action and specificity determinants of compounds , which will subsequently help in the design of new generations of improved antimicrobials, in terms of inhibitory potency and selectivity. such analyses might also highlight novel targets for antimicrobials. moreover, expression profiling is considered as a fingerprint to find common and distinct responses that could aid in the design of combined therapies of unrelated compounds, to which amp might contribute. however, this type of studies are still scarce in the case of amp, with only a few examples in bacteria  <cit>  and fungi, mostly yeast  <cit> . transcriptome profiling has been used to characterize the response of the model yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae to distinct antifungals  <cit> , including selected amp  <cit> .

in this study we aim to compare at a genomic scale the effects onto s. cerevisiae of two amp with distinctive properties. melittin is an α-helical membrane active peptide identified from honeybee venom that is recognized as a model pore-forming peptide for the study of peptide interaction with lipid bilayers and cell permeating properties  <cit> . on the other hand, paf <dig> is a short de novo-designed hexapeptide  <cit> , which shares sequence similarity with other amp from natural  <cit>  or synthetic origin  <cit> . it has activity against plant pathogenic fungi as well as several microorganisms of clinical relevance, including the yeast candida and several dermatophytic fungi  <cit> . paf <dig> at low micromolar  concentrations has been recently shown to have cell penetrating properties in the mycelium and conidia of the filamentous plant pathogen penicillium digitatum  <cit>  and the model fungus neurospora crassa . contrary to melittin, paf <dig> is less active against bacteria and is not haemolytic under assay conditions in which other peptides including melittin are  <cit> .

we combined global analyses of transcriptomic changes upon exposure of s. cerevisiae to sub-lethal concentrations of either paf <dig> or melittin with sensitivity tests of strains lacking genes identified by the transcriptomic data. our results both reinforce and extend similar studies undertaken previously with two unrelated α-helical amp  <cit> , and reveal that paf <dig> and melittin have common but also distinctive effects on yeast.

RESULTS
antimicrobial activity of peptides paf <dig> and melittin against s. cerevisiae
paf <dig> and the pore-forming peptide melittin inhibited yeast growth  <cit> , as was confirmed herein with strain fy <dig>  in experiments that show a slight 2-fold higher potency of melittin. dose-response experiments with additional strains of yeast with distinct genetic backgrounds and at two temperatures of incubation confirmed the activity of both peptides and also indicated a differential sensitivity of strains . thus, bgw7a, which has a weakened cw and is also sensitive to an increase in growth temperature and to plant antimicrobial proteins  <cit> , was markedly more sensitive than other strains to melittin and, to a minor extent, paf <dig>  on the other hand, strain ray3a  <cit>  had a susceptibility to peptide killing similar to strains fy <dig> and by <dig> 

global transcriptome response of s. cerevisiae to paf <dig> and melittin
in order to gain knowledge and compare the antifungal effect of paf <dig> and melittin we carried out the characterization of the transcriptome of s. cerevisiae after exposure to these peptides. the global transcriptome response to peptides was undertaken by treating s. cerevisiae fy <dig> cells in the logarithmic growth phase to sub-lethal concentrations  of either paf <dig> or melittin for  <dig> hours. under these assay conditions, no significant effects on growth were observed for any of the two peptides even after up to  <dig> hours of treatment . dna macroarrays representing more than  <dig>  yeast genes were hybridized with the cdnas from treated cells. the complete data set containing the quantification of signals has been submitted to the geo public database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/. annotation, processing and statistical significance of expression change for each dna probe are shown in additional file  <dig>  subsequent data analysis allowed the identification of genes with differential expression after each peptide treatment, as compared with control sample in the absence of peptide. in total,  <dig> genes  of the  <dig>  analyzed genes were responsive to melittin treatment while  <dig> genes  of the  <dig>  analyzed were differentially expressed after paf <dig> treatment. additional file  <dig> shows additional information on the genes with higher induction or repression upon each treatment. some examples of the most differential genes are arg <dig> as the gene with the highest induction specific of paf <dig>  pso <dig> having the highest co-induction with both peptides, or ste <dig> and btn <dig> as the most repressed with both peptides.

we focussed on genes from mapk signalling pathways that regulate response to environmental stresses/signals  <cit> , and were also responsive to peptides. within the hog <dig> osmotic stress cascade there were several genes that responded to paf <dig> but not to melittin, such as the stress-responsive transcriptional activator msn <dig> and the phosphorelay sensing ypd <dig> that were induced, or that coding for the mapkk pbs2p that was markedly repressed. in addition, the gene coding for the phosphatase ptc3p involved in hog1p dephosphorylation was also markedly induced. these transcription changes related to the osmolarity hog pathway seemed to be specific to paf <dig>  within the cw growth pathway, the sensing genes mid <dig> and rho <dig> also changed their expression upon exposure to melittin or paf <dig>  respectively. the only gene from these mapk pathways that responded similarly to both peptides was the scaffold ste <dig>  which in turn showed the strongest repression by both paf <dig> and melittin .

only a limited number of genes coding for transcription factors were responsive to peptide treatments, and in most cases showing an induction of expression. in addition to the above mentioned msn <dig>  there were the stress-responsive hot <dig>  nth <dig> and yap <dig> 

functional annotation analysis of the expression changes induced in response to paf <dig> and melittin
genome-scale functional annotation of the transcriptomic data was obtained by using the fatigo tool  <cit> , integrated in the gepas package http://gepas.org/ <cit> . this tool extracts gene ontology  terms that are over- or under-represented in sets of differentially expressed genes, as compared with the reference sets of non-responsive genes. it also provides statistical significance corrected for multiple testing and the level of go annotation. the complete non-redundant data set for the different combinations of treatments of our study is available in the additional file  <dig>  the analysis revealed significant terms among the genes that were induced and/or repressed by each peptide.

after exposure to  <dig> μm of paf <dig>  we observed up-regulation of genes involved in cell wall organization and biogenesis, belonging to the go annotation "chitin-and beta-glucan-containing cell wall" . of the  <dig> induced genes grouped under this annotation,  <dig> of them were also induced after exposure to  <dig> μm of melittin . remarkably, this cell-wall related class was the only significant annotation common to paf <dig> and melittin treatments found in our go analyses .

also significantly up-regulated by paf <dig> were  <dig> genes belonging to the go term "non-protein amino acid metabolic process" , including arg <dig>  arg <dig>  arg <dig>  and arg <dig>  all involved in arginine metabolism and urea cycle kegg pathway . all of them were significantly induced by paf <dig> but were either non-induced or non-analyzed  under the melittin treatment.

there were no significant go annotations among the genes specifically up-regulated by paf <dig> and that did not also respond to melittin, contrary to what occurs with the repressed genes . most of the genes specifically down-regulated upon exposure to paf <dig> were functionally related to tricistronic rrna processing and ribosome organization, biogenesis and maintenance , small nucleolar rna binding and also to translational initiation . the majority of these genes code for rna binding proteins, and we have previously reported that paf <dig> is capable of in vitro binding of trna from s. cerevisiae  <cit> . as an additional clue to the differential effects of both peptides, some of these categories and genes were even up-regulated by melittin  or significantly underrepresented among the melittin-repressed genes  . moreover, there was a very significant go annotation of "ribosome biogenesis and assembly"  within the seven genes up-regulated by melittin but repressed by paf <dig> , since six genes  share this term.

validation of gene expression changes by quantitative rt-pcr
in order to sustain the macroarray data,  <dig> genes were arbitrarily selected taking into account different criteria, as the magnitude of the expression change, the differential behaviour with both peptides, or the go annotation results; and their expression change was determined by quantitative rt-pcr . thus,  <dig> genes  were selected as related to cw composition and organization. representatives of genes related to ribosome biogenesis and processing were nop <dig> and cgr <dig>  finally arg <dig>  arg <dig>  arg <dig> and btn <dig> were chosen because of the magnitude of their induction or repression, respectively, under paf <dig> exposure. importantly, an additional control was included in these experiments. given that melittin was slightly more active on s. cerevisiae than paf <dig> , a five-fold higher concentration of paf <dig>  was included to rule out a peptide dose effect that might alter the interpretation of the macroarray data. overall, this approach discards such a dose effect for a substantial number of the genes . the qrt-pcr results of the  <dig> selected genes validate the macroarray data. notably, the differential response to peptides was confirmed for nop <dig>  cgr <dig> or the three arg genes analysed . the induction of arg <dig> was around  <dig> times greater than control levels after exposure to paf <dig> but we did not observe a significant change of expression after exposure to  <dig> μm of melittin . a similar paf <dig> specific induction was confirmed for arg <dig> and arg <dig> . the specific up-regulation of arg <dig> was confirmed through independent experiments of treatment of s. cerevisiae with paf <dig> or melittin, in which rna samples were collected to quantify expression by quantitative rt-pcr in a time course experiment .

susceptibility to paf <dig> or melittin of s. cerevisiae deletion mutants
considering the results described above, a set of  <dig> s. cerevisiae deletion mutants  <cit>  were analyzed for susceptibility to paf <dig> or melittin. the annotation and complete dataset of the susceptibility of mutants is found in additional file  <dig>  only significant findings are discussed and shown in detail below. deletion strains were divided into distinct groups according to their functional classification, significance or expression behaviour. two numerous groups are related to  enzymes or structural proteins involved in cw composition and strengthening, and  the distinct stress-sensing mapk signalling cascades related to cw in s. cerevisiae. as many of these genes are related to cw composition and response, the deletion mutants were also analyzed for their sensitivity to the membrane and cw interfering agents, sodium dodecyl sulphate  and calcofluor white .

deletion strains from all the well characterized mapk signalling pathways  <cit>  were selected from at least at three points of each pathway, with an emphasis on signalling related to cw integrity and construction and osmoregulation . some of the mutants showed a minor increase of resistance to paf <dig>  several deletions tested in our experiments were, as already known, heavily affected in terms of sensitivity to sds or cfw , indicating strong alterations in the cw deposition or response to stress. remarkably, none of these and the other mapk pathway mutants were severely affected in their sensitivity to peptides .

other deletion strains were selected from the go processes identified by functional annotation. from the three mutants tested that lack genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and rna processing, two of them  were more resistant to paf <dig> than to melittin . a noticeable specific response occurred with most of the arg deletants analyzed; all of them involved in the "arginine biosynthesis" and "urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups" pathways. in addition to deletants from arg <dig>  arg <dig>  arg <dig>  and arg <dig> that showed a substantial specific up-regulation by paf <dig>  those from arg <dig>  arg <dig> and car <dig> were also assayed. these seven deletants showed varying degrees of increased resistance to paf <dig>  which was substantial for arg <dig>  arg <dig> and arg <dig> . importantly, none of these strains showed phenotypes associated to cw weakening as determined by their sensitivity to sds or cfw .

the ipt <dig> gene codes for the enzyme responsible of the last step in the biosynthesis of the major plasma membrane sphingolipid mannose-2-ceramide   <cit> . its deletion confers resistance to other antifungals and plant antimicrobial proteins  <cit> . in our experiments, ipt <dig> expression decreased in response to melittin but not in response to paf <dig>  within the same pathway, lcb <dig> encodes the enzyme of the first committed step of sphingolipid biosynthesis, and its expression was markedly repressed by paf <dig> . the Δipt <dig> mutant showed a remarkable phenotype of high resistance to paf <dig> combined with increased sensitivity to sds . another mutant lacking a gene involved in ceramide synthase synthesis  was assayed but no alteration on sensitivity to peptides was found .

paf <dig> and related peptides are arginine-rich and penetratin-type peptides  <cit> . btn <dig> codes for a protein with protein binding activity involved in amino acid transport, ph and ion homeostasis and arginine uptake  <cit> . it was, together with ste <dig> , the gene with the highest repression common to both peptides . however, neither the corresponding deletion strain nor the related Δbtn <dig>  <cit>  displayed significant differences regarding sensitivity to peptides .

hsc <dig> was used as a representative of the several heat shock proteins  that are markedly repressed by paf <dig> and/or melittin such as hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> or sti <dig> . indeed, the response to unfolded protein stress go term was significantly repressed upon melittin treatment . hsc <dig> was repressed by paf <dig>  and the corresponding deletion strain was selectively more resistant to paf <dig> .

interaction of paf <dig> with s. cerevisiae cells
we have previously reported that paf <dig> is capable to interact with and be internalized by the hyphal cells of the filamentous fungus p. digitatum at sub-inhibitory concentrations   <cit> . paf <dig> is markedly less active against s. cerevisiae than towards p. digitatum  <cit>  and, accordingly, although internalization of fluorescently labeled paf <dig> into s. cerevisiae fy <dig> could be demonstrated through confocal microscopy, 100-fold higher peptide concentrations  were required .

in order to determine whether the sensitivity to paf <dig> is correlated with the interaction and uptake of the peptide into s. cerevisiae, and also how this is associated with cell viability, we set up an assay in which cells were treated with fitc-paf <dig> followed by treatment with the cell death marker propidium iodide  and the cw stain cfw . approximately 5-20% of s. cerevisiae by <dig> were labeled by fitc-paf <dig> under these assay conditions , and such labeling co-localized with that of pi. also, staining by cfw showed strong cell wall disorganization for those non-viable cells into which peptide were located. despite not using confocal optics as in figure 6a, this three-fluorophore staining also supports the internalization of the peptide and confirmed that cells showing the highest peptide signal were the most permeable to pi. our microscopy experiments also show fitc-paf <dig> accumulation in the cytosol, excluded from the vacuole .

selected deletion mutants were analyzed using this approach . microscopical observations were validated by quantification of labeled paf <dig> binding by flow cytometry . deletion strains in genes involved in cell wall construction such as ssd <dig> or ecm <dig> showed a correlation with the higher sensitivity to paf <dig> in that a proportion of cells higher than in the parental strain were labeled by the peptide and showed intense staining by pi. however, the resistant Δarg <dig>  Δnop <dig> or Δipt <dig> mutants did not show a noticeable difference of peptide labeling as compared with the parental strain  and in some experiments, such as the one shown in the corresponding panel of figure  <dig> , a higher proportion of cells were labeled with the peptide. this latter result indicates that the higher resistance of these strains is not due to lack of interaction and/or internalization of the peptide.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
we have carried out a functional genomic approach on yeast to gain insight into the mechanism of two amp that presumably have different modes of antifungal killing. analogous reports have addressed the mode of action of distinct antifungal agents  <cit> , including other amp  <cit> . these latter studies on amp used inhibitory concentrations and found an array of multifactorial effects, but could not distinguish those processes primary related to peptide mechanism from those secondarily derived from cell death. since we have observed biological changes of p. digitatum after exposure to sub-inhibitory  concentrations of paf <dig> that include peptide internalization  <cit> , we decided to use non-inhibitory concentrations of amp in the gene expression experiments  in an attempt to unveil primary effects of the peptides. also, by choosing two peptides with differentiated interactions with fungal cells, we could isolate processes both common and specific of each one. the transcriptomic data demonstrates specific and statistically significant changes under these conditions that our fungicidal assays demonstrate that are involved in sensitivity to peptides.

we have combined the identification of differentially expressed genes with the use of global functional annotation tools  <cit> . from the wealth of available data , we highlight in this report the most relevant conclusions. first, our study reinforces the idea that cell permeation is not the only mechanism required to fully describe the effect of, and response to, amp in microorganisms  <cit> . we have also shown that paf <dig> and melittin have common but also differential effects on yeast. finally, a previously overlooked observation is that a significant part of the response relies on genes of unknown function, or with poorly informative go terms associated to them.

a remarkable example of uncharacterized genes uncovered in our study is ylr162w, the only gene not related to ribosome biogenesis among the seven induced by melittin and repressed by paf <dig> . it is a predicted gene of unknown function that codes for a small protein with potential transmembrane domains  <cit> . an independent study has shown that over expression of ylr162w confers resistance to the plant antimicrobial peptide miamp <dig> in a susceptible yeast strain  <cit> . strikingly, our study indicates  that ylr162w reacts distinctly to different amp, and thus highlights the interest of studying its function since it might have an important and distinctive role in the response to amp. blast searches do not show any homolog of this gene in known fungal sequences .

the role of the fungal cell wall in susceptibility to amp
the most obvious shared response is related to reinforcement of the cell wall. among the  <dig> genes that were co-expressed in the peptide treatments , the only go significant annotations were related to the fungal cw . additional studies found altered genes involved in cw maintenance in response to other antifungal agents or cw perturbants as well  <cit> . among the previous genomic studies of the response to amp in yeast, only the one that used the esculentin 1- <dig> peptide highlighted cw responses at the transcriptomic level  <cit> , while others did not  <cit> . in addition, six genes  were identified whose deletions confer increased sensitivity to either dermaseptin s <dig> or magainin  <dig>  <cit> . our observations sustain that the improvement of cw integrity is a common response of s. cerevisiae to amp. further support arises from the data on bwg7a strain, which has a weakened cw phenotype related to a dysfunctional ssd <dig> allele  <cit>  that compromises viability in the presence of amp and at higher incubation temperatures . yeast cells are capable of reinforcing their cw when subjected to stress or damage conditions  <cit> , and our study contributes to demonstrate that this is also the case after amp treatment. the use of bwg7a has allowed the isolation of genes that partially overcome sensitivity to the plant antimicrobial protein osmotin, such as yeast pir genes or fusarium homologs of ssd <dig> and sed <dig>  <cit> . on the other hand, deletion of specific cw proteins sensitize yeast to the antibacterial lantibiotic nisin  <cit> . further, paf <dig> induced severe mycelial growth and cell-shape defects to the fungus p. digitatum  <cit> , changes that are typical for compounds affecting the cell wall.

our assays showed only a limited number of gene deletions related to cw that have an effect on sensitivity to paf <dig> or melittin. even in these examples, the magnitude of the phenotype of the mutants  is modest compared to that of mutants related to ribosome biogenesis, arginine metabolism, sphingolipid or hsp related genes . this holds even for genes such as the above mentioned ssd <dig>  which mediates deposition of other cw proteins in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . the corresponding deletion strain has a damaged cw as confirmed by hyper-sensitivity to sds or cfw, but comparatively only a minor increase in susceptibility to amp as demonstrated in two genetic backgrounds . a similar phenotype was observed in other strains such as Δecm <dig>  microscopy and flow cytometry studies in Δssd <dig> or Δecm <dig> showed a correlation between a higher sensitivity and an increase of paf <dig> uptake of cells , demonstrating that cw components modulate the interaction with peptides.

function redundancy might explain the lack of a dramatic change in the susceptibility in mutants related to cw. therefore multiple deletions would be expected to have a higher impact and are being studied in our laboratory. however, our current data do not support this view either, as illustrated with the triple deletion of pir genes in the ray3a background . even in the case of gene deletions from mapk signalling cascades involved in cw construction and response to stress  <cit> , we did not find major differences in sensitivity to peptides under our assay conditions . representative examples are ste <dig> that was highly repressed by both peptides, or slt <dig>  pbs <dig> and hog <dig>  whose deletants are hypersensitive to cw interfering compounds. this result contrasts with previous data in which mutations in the hog osmoregulatory pathway in the case of the peptide histatin  <cit>  or the rho1-slt <dig> cw growth pathway in a plant defensin pn-amp <dig>  <cit>  result in hypersensitivity.

other cw-related gene deletions did not show significant differences in susceptibility to peptides and even in a limited number of examples  a slight higher resistance was observed. it has been described that specific gene deletions result in counteracting mechanisms to reinforce cw by enhancing levels of specific cw constituents  <cit> . also, it can not be discarded that lost of specific cw proteins/components results in increased resistance due to reduced peptide binding to cell surface as shown for a dermaseptin derivative that seems to bind cw protein mannosyl phosphate residues  <cit> . under this view, an attractive hypothesis that needs to be tested is that the different cw proteins identified in ours and previous studies reflect differences in the interaction of distinct amp with the cell envelope  <cit> .

involvement of the ipt <dig> gene in amp sensitivity
a noteworthy mutant with a marked increased resistance to paf <dig> was Δipt <dig> . sphingolipids are essential components of the plasma membrane in all eukaryotic cells and ipt1p catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of the fungal sphingolipid m2c. previous works with the Δipt <dig> mutant showed high resistance to dmamp <dig>  an antifungal plant defensin, and lower peptide binding to the yeast surface than the wild-type strain  <cit> . the authors proposed that dmamp <dig> interacts with this sphingolipid to exert the antifungal action  <cit> . in addition, mutants lacking the ipt <dig> gene also showed resistance to syringomycin e  <cit> . we found that the Δipt <dig> strain was resistant to paf <dig>  but bound fitc-paf <dig> to the same extent as the parental strain , in contrast to what was reported in the plant defensin example. this apparent contradiction could be explained considering that the initial binding of paf <dig> to the fungal cell occurs at the cw, and not at the plasma membrane. also remarkably, Δipt <dig> resistance to paf <dig> is coincident with extreme sensitivity to the membrane perturbing sds . this differential behaviour was unique among the strains analyzed in our study. it neatly demonstrates that although interaction is the first step in the antimicrobial mechanism of peptides, other additional susceptibility factors exist since an abnormal membrane and/or weakened cw does not always lead to higher susceptibility to paf <dig> and other antimicrobial peptides/proteins. overall, the data indicate that involvement of ipt <dig> and presence of m2c in the yeast plasma membrane could be a common factor for distinct amp to exert their action onto s. cerevisiae.

intracellular effects of paf26
an overlapping response to distinct amp seems to be related to dna breakdown and/or induction of apoptosis  <cit> . no significant annotation related to dna damage or apoptosis was found in our go analyses . however, the gene with the highest induction  by both peptides was pso <dig>  which was not identified in any of the previous studies. it is highly induced after dna strand breaks and binds damaged dna. on the other hand, the dna ligase gene dnl <dig> required for non-homologous end-joining  and repair of dsdna breaks is among the most repressed by both peptides. strikingly, ldb <dig> also involved in nhej was the only gene repressed by two unrelated amp  <cit> , demonstrating that independent studies point to the same processes even though they identify distinct individual genes. we have previously shown that both paf <dig> and melittin share with other cationic amp the capacity to bind nucleic acids in vitro  <cit> . it remains to be determined to which extent this binding activity has a functional significance in vivo.

go profiling demonstrated a prominent differential effect related to rrna processing and ribosomal biogenesis, which were repressed by paf <dig> but induced by melittin. a high number of genes from these annotations showed this marked differential response with extremely significant p-values , including the group of seven genes induced by melittin and repressed by paf <dig> , and was also confirmed by quantitative rt-pcr in selected genes . the repression behavior is shared in the response to other amp, antimicrobial compounds and additional stress conditions  <cit> . mrnas from ribosomal proteins and rrna processing enzymes are predicted to destabilize under stress conditions  <cit> . it is assumed that shutdown of ribosome biogenesis and thus protein translation will free cell resources to cope with a hostile environment. however, our study opens additional questions as to the significance of the induction  of this response in the case of melittin, or of the increased resistance to paf <dig> in some of the corresponding deletion strains such as that of the nucleolar protein nop <dig> .

the gene btn <dig> has been reported to modulate arginine uptake through down-regulation of the can1p arginine permease  <cit> . our study shows that btn <dig> was one of the most repressed gene by both peptides , suggesting that the cell is sensing the high arginine levels caused by peptide internalization and mounts an active response to deal with it. go profiling indicated the specific involvement of the "nonprotein amino acid metabolic process" in the response to paf <dig>  including genes from the biosynthesis or arginine, metabolism of amino groups and urea cycle , which were induced by paf <dig> but not by melittin. arg <dig> was the gene with the highest paf26-specific induction identified in our macroarray study, and such strong expression change was confirmed through qrt-pcr analysis . arg <dig> codes for the argininosuccinate synthase and is known to be transcriptionally repressed in the presence of arginine. induction of these genes is indicative of attempt of metabolization of the high concentration of amino groups of cationic amp such as paf <dig>  in fact, their induction could lead to accumulation of derived metabolites in the cell. although the question of ammonium toxicity in yeast is still controversial  <cit> , we speculate that this could be the case given the higher resistance to paf <dig> of the deletion mutants assayed. in any case the high resistance to paf <dig> of a number of arg gene deletants confirms the involvement of these pathways in the peptide killing mechanism . importantly, susceptibility to paf <dig> did not correlate with peptide interaction/internalization into cells in Δarg <dig> . this mutant also combines a significant amount of peptide labelling with high resistance, confirming that peptide binding and toxicity are separate processes.

numerous chaperone-related genes respond to paf <dig> and/or melittin, and the go term "response to unfolded protein stress" was significantly repressed by melittin . the co-chaperone regulator of chaperone activity sti <dig> was the fifth most repressed gene by both peptides . hsc82p and hsp82p are the two isoforms of the hsp90-like chaperone in yeast and are among the most abundant proteins in the cytosol  <cit> . hsc <dig> is considered to be constitutive while hsp <dig> is strongly induced by heat stress; the corresponding proteins are involved in folding of recalcitrant and denatured proteins. contrary to hsp <dig>  the hsc <dig> gene was strongly repressed by paf <dig> and the deletion strain was more resistant to paf <dig> killing . previous reports suggest that although nearly identical in sequence, these two isoforms are not functionally equivalent  <cit> . our study provides additional data on the involvement of protein chaperones and heat shock proteins in antimicrobial peptide mode of action, which has been invoked in previous reports that include yeast and bacterial studies  <cit> . among the eleven chaperones repressed by melittin we found ssa <dig>  coding for the cw protein that together with ssa1p was shown to bind the amp histatin  <dig> and promote peptide internalization  <cit> .

in summary, our findings help to confirm that permeation is not the unique effect of these and other amp, and that additional  mechanisms that go beyond cell lysis are involved. the data presented support the idea that cw reinforcement and modification are part of a general fungal response to peptides with different modes of action. however, a weakened cw is not necessarily indicative of a higher sensitivity to amp. the importance of the response to unfolded protein stress or the sphingolipid biosynthesis, previously reported for other unrelated amp, was also confirmed independently, therefore suggesting their broad contribution to activity of antimicrobial peptides. this study has also uncovered additional processes and genes that will be further analyzed in the near future, as is the case of the involvement of the metabolism of amino groups in the case of paf <dig> or the ylr162w gene.
