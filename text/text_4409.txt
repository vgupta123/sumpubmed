BACKGROUND
the general secretory pathway  is a protein export process of major biological and technological significance. cell communication, as well as intercellular signaling and growth during development in multicellular organisms depends on the secretion pathway. the export of a commercial protein into the extracellular medium by a recombinant cell can facilitate its downstream processing. the yeast kluyveromyces lactis is considered a promising host for heterologous protein production. because yeasts naturally do not secrete as many proteins as filamentous fungi, they can produce secreted recombinant proteins with few contaminants in the medium  <cit> . an ideal system for secreting a desired protein could be developed from analysis of the native proteins. the completed k. lactis genome sequence provides the tools to construct such a system  <cit> . as the genomes of several hemiascomycetes yeasts are now sequenced  <cit>  and cross-comparison does not reveal significant differences, the prospect of discovering a potentially significant secreted protein using bioinformatics techniques is high  <cit> . in k. lactis, as in other eukaryotes, secreted proteins are typically recognized by the presence of an n-terminal signal sequence to direct them to gsp  <cit> . signal sequences usually have a well-characterized structure composed of a central hydrophobic core . this consists of an average of 6– <dig> amino acid  residues that are flanked by hydrophilic n- and c-terminal regions. the h-region is important for correct targeting and membrane insertion of the peptide. at the polar c-terminal region, helix breaking often occurs because of proline and glycine residues and small uncharged residues at the - <dig> and - <dig> positions that determine the signal peptide cleavage site  <cit> . the polar n-terminal region is variable in length and frequently positively charged  <cit> . although some proteins lacking n-terminal signal sequences reach the extracellular medium, the majority of soluble secreted proteins in k. lactis are likely to be transported via the gsp  <cit> . a wide variety of computational methods have been used to predict the subcellular localization of proteins  <cit> . the methods differ in the input data they demand and the techniques applied to make decisions or predictions about location. once the input data type are fixed, the methods for making predictions are basically by two methods: the manual construction of explicit rules for localization prediction using current knowledge of sorting signals, or applying data-driven, machine-learning techniques  or hidden markov models, )  <cit> . the latter automatically extracts decision rules from the sets of proteins with known location, without making any prior, detailed assumptions about the features of interest.

in addition to using direct algorithm analysis to predict extracellular proteins, the extracellular secretome can be analyzed through its possible transcription factors . tfs are part of the signal transduction pathway that modulates the cell metabolism in response to environmental stimuli  <cit> . the tfs that contain dna binding motifs are the component of the signaling pathway that is closest to the level of the dna. to a large degree, the combinatorial presence and absence of transcription factor binding sites  is responsible for gene regulation complexity  <cit> . the identification of tfbss has been used to infer regulatory networks for several different yeasts  <cit> .

using an algorithm approach, we proposed identifying extracellular protein candidates in the yeast k. lactis and determining tfbss in the promoters of their genes. analysis of the relationship to transcriptional regulators used the dataset of bussereau et al  <cit> , and putative promoter regions  <dig> kb upstream of the genes that encode the predicted extracellular proteins.

RESULTS
prediction of k. lactis extracellular proteins
a flowchart of the algorithms used to generate the database of potential extracellular k. lactis proteins is in figure  <dig>  using the standard criteria of signalp v <dig>   <cit> , and the nn and hmm scores from  <dig> k. lactis open reading frames ,  <dig> orfs containing consensus sequences for n-terminal signal peptides and signal peptidase cleavage sites within 10– <dig> amino acid residues were predicted. when the  <dig> deduced proteins harboring n-terminal signal peptides were submitted to the phobius algorithm  <cit> , only  <dig> were predicted to carry extra transmembrane domains, excluding the transmembrane domain of the signal peptide. the following analyses were conducted with the remaining  <dig> orfs. to identify gpi modification sites, the orfs were submitted to big-pi predictor  <cit> , with the results indicating that  <dig> orfs contained a signal peptide, no transmembrane domain, and no gpi modification site. as some gsp proteins may be targeted to intracellular organelles rather than the extracellular medium, the algorithm wolf psort  <cit>  was used to detect conserved addresses to organelles. the outcome indicated  <dig> orfs predicted with extracellular addresses. among these,  <dig> had the highest k-nn score l the remaining  <dig> had lower k-nn scores  and were excluded, to increase the probability of selecting actual secreted proteins for further correlation with the transcription factor dataset.

using a statistical approach, the first gps criteria, the signal peptide, was tested against the following datasets: yep , klrs , the predicted extracellular proteins determined by wolf psort, and epms dataset by swain et al  <cit>  . the yep scores showed nn s/d greater than  <dig>  and hmm around  <dig> , whereas klrs simultaneously presented scores below  <dig>  and  <dig>  . the comparison between the controls for signalp and the secreted orfs scores revealed that the scores of the  <dig> orfs were very similar to yep, specifically, nn s/d was  <dig>  and hmm was  <dig>  . thus, the standards criteria provided by signalp were correctly encountered in all  <dig> sequences from the positive control. the epms dataset showed a high nn score  and high hmm score  in 67% of sequences . although the other 33% were not detected as secreted by the predicted algorithms, the remaining 67% had a  <dig>  probability of being equal to the predicted dataset according to t-square test .

to evaluate the criteria for predicting the presence or absence of n-terminal signal peptides in the k. lactis dataset, the hotelling t-square multivariate test  was employed on the basis of nn mean s/d and hmm scores. the vector parameters for each control set were compared to the predicted set and confirmed by t-square test. the estimated  <dig> orfs were closer to the yep dataset  than the klrs .

analysis of annotations
the biological significance of the predicted extracellular proteins of k lactis was determined on the basis of annotations available at the genolevures website . of the  <dig> predicted k. lactis extracellular proteins,  <dig> were annotated as similar to s. cerevisiae, and five as documented k. lactis proteins. enzymes were the largest functional group  of known predicted proteins. a smaller group  was predicted as having a pheromone or mating-type function. among the known sequences, 9% were considered intracellular proteins or wrong predictions . for those unknown potential k. lactis extracellular proteins , the protein family database  was applied to attempt to find relationships to known protein families through conserved domains . the results demonstrated nine singletons among  <dig> that harbored conserved domains with varying pfam scores. the alpha mating factor precursor n-terminus , kappa casein , nadh dehydrogenase subunit  <dig> c-terminus , bacterial regulatory protein-fis family , thioredoxin , mucin-like glycoprotein , and collagen triple helix repeat  all gave higher pfam scores. analysis of the improbable secreted domains was carried out by alignment using blast tools . from nine sequences, six with nonsecreted domains were found to have a possible relation to extracellular proteins in other taxons.

relationship between the predicted extracellular proteins and transcriptional factors repertoire
the putative promoter region was taken as one kb upstream of each predicted extracellular protein-encoding orf and analyzed using the yeastract website tool  <cit>  to identify tfbss related to s. cerevisiae. the results indicated the presence of  <dig> different tfbss. in addition, the supporting algorithms in supplementary materials found  <dig> tfs homologs in k. lactis when comparing the k. lactis tfs dataset published by bussereau et al  <cit>  to s. cerevisiae. at least two tfbs in each promoter region were established by this analysis. in the yeastract database, all the tfs have gene ontology  terms , that is, known details about the cellular function and address. these data  showed that all  <dig> sequences have the tfbs for mot3p ,  <dig> had a site for stb5p ,  <dig> for fkh1p ,  <dig> for gcn4p ,  <dig> for hac1p ,  <dig> for mcm1p ,  <dig> for rgt1p ,  <dig> for nrg1p ,  <dig> for adr1p ,  <dig> for pho4p , and  <dig> for yap1p . from this analysis, the tfs dataset is estimated to be a group that us likely to have a major influence on the extracellular secretome.

the relationship between the transcriptional regulators and predicted extracellular proteome has great complexity. therefore, to create an ab initio model, the data were shaped by graph theory. one of the graph representations was a square-directed non-weighted adjacency matrix, with  <dig> rows and columns. among them,  <dig> were the predicted proteins identified in this study,  <dig> with their related tfs. the graph was created with  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges. as illustrated in figure  <dig>  a three-spanning tree was extracted to illustrate the complexity of the regulatory network for each predicted orfs. three well-known extracellular proteins in k. lactis were use, along with α-factor mating pheromone , invertase , and acid phosphatase precursor . supporting material can be found at our website, .

discussion
because of its distinctive physiological properties, k. lactis has become an important model as a non-saccharomyces yeast. in addition, k. lactis has great potential for biotechnological applications including expression of heterologous proteins  <cit> . these possibilities motivated us to study the global extracellular proteome and correlate it to tfs using a bioinformatics approach. the final results have shown  <dig> proteins that are potentially secreted by k. lactis. in addition to using the tmhmm and targetp algorithsm used by lee et al  <cit>  and swaim et al  <cit> , the phobius  <cit>  and wolf psort  <cit>  were applied to find transmembrane domains and subcellular addressing that would direct targeted proteins to organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum, golgi, and proteasomes. the wolf psort algorithm appeared to be more accurate; also, when the dataset of secreted proteins detected experimentally by swain et al  <cit>  was compared by the predicting methods of lee et al  <cit> , it has detected more proteins  than wolf psort . however, analysis of the prediction error rate was  <dig> % for wolf psort and about  <dig> % for targetp. the appearance of proteins in the medium changes in different physiological conditions  <cit> , so the predictive methods chosen here decrease error rates and improve the chances of obtaining an actual extracellular protein in a given physiological condition. the error reduction may come from the incremented algorithmic phobius  <cit>  combining transmembrane topology and signal peptide prediction, and the new algorithm wolf psort  <cit>  to predict the subcellular localization of proteins on the basis of their amino acid sequences using k-nn . as described by swain et al  <cit> , in the signal peptide detection step, the prediction algorithm signalp v <dig>   <cit>  was used to give two nn prediction scores, mean s and mean d, and one hmm score. these nn scores were used for statistical analysis in the first step to identify extracellular proteins by the conserved secretory pathway features of a signal peptide and a signal peptidase cleavage site  <cit> . accuracy in identifying extracellular proteins may be decreased because proteins that act in the periplasmic space or the cell wall also pass through the gps. motifs or conserved addresses for the perisplasmic space or cell wall have not yet been found. thus, the strategy adopted to classify the results in this study focused on annotation terms and on pfam, a database of conserved domains and families  <cit> . the genolevure third release is the main publicly available annotation dataset for k. lactis sequences. therefore, the pfam  <cit>  database was used in addition to updating the genolevures annotation. both showed five k. lactis annotated secreted proteins: acid phosphatase, repressible acid phosphatase precursor, guanosine diphosphatase, exo- <dig> -beta-glucanase and invertase. although some of these proteins have not been described as acting in the extracellular space according to domínguez et al  <cit> , s. cerevisiae proteins are not found free in the extracellular medium but are retained in the periplasmic space or associated with the cell wall. k. lactis, however, does not seem to have the same characteristic; in fact, it has been reported to secrete high molecular weight proteins  <cit> . thus, in this study, proteins from the periplasmic space or associated with the cell wall have been considered as part of the potential extracellular proteins dataset.

bioinformatics identifications are probabilistic in nature, so the advantage of our analysis lies in the low cost and high speed with which these identifications can be obtained  <cit> ; hence, this analysis exploited an ab initio model of physiological inference. the model was created using the computational extracellular proteome dataset, the transcriptional regulators repertoire mined by bussereau et al  <cit> , and the yeastract methodology created by teixeira et al  <cit> . since gene expression programs depend on recognition of specific promoter sequences by transcriptional regulatory proteins  <cit> , we decided to analyze the relationship between the consensus sequences or dna binding motifs and transcriptional regulators. one of the first changes that occurs in a cell after an environmental stimulus is the content of transcriptional regulators  <cit> . when a set of s. cerevisiae transcriptional regulators orthologues and their related dna motifs binding sites was identified, a high level of polymorphism, or dna binding factors capable of binding to both specific and nonspecific sequences, was observed  <cit> . because of the complex relation between tfs and the predicted secretome, the data obtained was analyzed using graph theory  <cit> . the empirical model may suggest many conditions that have not yet been thought of by intuitive inference. the go terms described for each tf dataset showed possible major interactions related to stress and the cell cycle. the results of this study are in accordance with the literature, because expressions of extracellular proteins increase in stress situations or in the exponential phase when the cell requires proteins that interact in the cell wall or in the periplasmic space  <cit> . however, for a good secretion system, a few different proteins that can show high expression and secretion are needed. an ab initio model allows searching for both these proteins and the environmental conditions that might improve their expression and secretion.

CONCLUSIONS
based on selected algorithms signalp v <dig>  phobius, bigpi-predictor and wolf psort, and adopting the highest wolf psort k-nn scores and using multivariate t-square analysis for verification, we predicted an extracellular k. lactis secretome of  <dig> proteins. the well-known extracellular k. lactis proteins such as α-factor mating pheromone, invertase, and acid phosphatase precursor were among the  <dig> predicted proteins. in addition, by considering the genolevure annotations and comparing to pfam, 48% of the known proteins had enzyme activity. by applying the s. cerevisiae yeastract database,  <dig> transcription factor orthologues were found,  <dig> of which had binding sites in the promoters of the  <dig> predicted k. lactis secretome. an ab initio model of physiological inference is presented. the model is a graph with  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges that suggests a large number of relationships between the proteins and physiological conditions that can be experimentally validated. most of the predicted tf for extracellular proteins are related to stress responses, such as drug, acid and heat resistance, as well as nitrogen limitation, which may prove useful for inducing maximal expression of the potential extracellular proteins. a condition that favors secretion could be used to design a system to improve the secretion of a desired protein. our model is stored in a public database .
