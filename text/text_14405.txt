BACKGROUND
riemerella anatipestifer  is a gram-negative bacterium belonging to the flavobacteriaceae family. this bacterium is the causative agent of r. anatipestifer infection, which result in septicemic disease in ducks, geese, turkeys, and other birds. the associated disease represents a major problem for the duck industry worldwide, and is the cause of significant economic losses  <cit> .

clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats  and the crispr-associated  proteins constitute the crispr-cas system. this system provides a novel adaptive immunologic mechanism against exogenous nucleic acid invasion in archaea and bacteria . the crispr-cas locus is found to be widespread in prokaryotes, being present in ~50 % of sequenced bacterial genomes and ~87 % of sequenced archaea genomes  <cit> . the crispr-cas locus consists of a crispr array and a set of cas genes . moreover, a leader sequence is involved occasionally . the crispr array is composed of direct repeat sequences  and spacer sequences  that are derived from phages, plasmids or other mobile genetic elements . the corresponding sequences in foreign genetic elements are called protospacers . the leader sequence is at-rich, and is located upstream of crispr array . this sequence is considered the promoter for the crispr locus in some strains . the immunologic mechanism employed by the crispr-cas system commonly consists of three steps. in the acquisition step, a fragment of exogenous genetic elements integrates into the crispr array, generating a new repeat-spacer unit . during the expression step, the crispr array is transcribed and processed into crispr rna , which is bound to a single cas protein or to a multi-subunit complex comprised of multiple cas proteins . then the crrna guides the cas protein to target and cleave the protospacer of cognate exogenous nucleic acids in the interference step . however, the specific molecular mechanisms vary depending on the system used. additionally, trans-encoded crispr rnas  have been identified and are considered an additional factor of type ii systems  <cit> . the tracrrnas are encoded by sequences found close to the cas operon and crispr array and are distinguished by the presence of an anti-repeat sequence complement with cognate repeats  <cit> . during interference, in addition to complementarity between protospacer and the spacer portion of crrna, a defined sequence  musts flank on one side of the protospacer to avoid self-targeting. moreover, pam is involved in spacer acquisition .

nowadays, the crispr-cas systems can be divided into two classes, five types and  <dig> subtypes  <cit> . class  <dig> systems, with multi-subunit effector complexes made up of multiple cas proteins, include type i, type iii and putative type iv. class  <dig> systems, with a single cas protein effector, encompass type ii and putative type v. based on distinct cas protein composition and architecture of cas operon, the five main types can be further classified into sixteen subtypes. each of the five types has its own signature cas gene, which is cas <dig> , cas <dig>  cas <dig>  csf <dig> and cpf <dig> respectively  <cit> . the latest research has discovered that there are three novel class  <dig> systems, namely, two subtypes of putative type v  and putative type vi   <cit> . each grouping harnesses specific molecular mechanism although these systems share main functional modules and play a role in immunity . to date, because of limitations pertaining to genomic sequence data for r. anatipestifer, structural analyses of r. anatipestifer crispr-cas systems have not been performed. in this study, we performed sequence analysis of the crispr-cas systems from  <dig> different strains, including  <dig> clinical strains that had previously been isolated by our research group.

methods
r. anatipestifer strains
eighteen clinical strains were isolated from the livers of infected ducks from seven different provinces in china. the information of bacterial strains utilized is listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

six complete genomes of r. anatipestifer strains  were retrieved from national center for biotechnology information   <cit> . the accession numbers of these complete genomes were listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

genomic dna extraction and sequencing
genomic dna was extracted with a tianamp bacteria dna kit . then the sequences of these strains analyzed were determined using a high-throughput sequencing platform  with an average genome coverage of 100x. velvet version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  was used for de novo assembly. ncbi prokaryotic genome annotation pipeline   was utilized to facilitate genome annotation. all of the genome sequences were submitted to ncbi, with the most relevant information listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

phylogenic analysis of r. anatipestifer strains
a phylogenetic tree  of the nineteen sequenced genomes and six ncbi deposited complete genomes was constructed using a pangenome analysis tool-bpga  <cit>  based on pangenome of r. anatipestifer. this analysis utilized all default parameters.

crispr-cas locus sequence analysis and prediction
the information pertaining to the crispr locus including position, length and content were acquired from crisprfinder   <cit>  and crispri   <cit> . loci with less than five repeat numbers were termed “questionable crispr loci”, and those which were not termed “confirmed crispr loci”, the former were not used as part of this analysis. additionally, each of the loci obtained was manually checked as previously reported. briefly, crispr loci located in coding regions should be discarded. likewise, the loci which possesses repeats larger than 48 nt ought to be abandoned. the online tool weblogo   <cit>  was used to analyze the conservation of the associated repeats, and secondary structure prediction of the repeats was performed using mfold   <cit> . the spacers for each locus were manually identified and compared. crisprtarget   <cit>  was utilized to predict the presence of possible protospacers. protospacers were identified if the associated sequences contained four or fewer snps  between spacers and phage or plasmid sequences. we aligned the protospacers with the flanking sequences comprising 20 bp on each side to find pam by using weblogo. the non-coding sequences upstream of the first repeat were selected as the putative leader sequences and aligned using clustalx software   <cit> . subsequently, the putative leader sequences were screened for promoters using the bdgp neural network promoter prediction tool   <cit> . the 10 kb-long sequences flanking the crispr array were extracted and analyzed using the blast program   <cit>  to identify cas genes. the composition of cas genes and cas proteins in r. anatipestifer was analyzed using snapgene software . cas protein sequences of other bacteria were retrieved from the ncbi protein database. mega software   <cit>  was utilized to conduct the phylogenetic analysis of cas proteins, and the phylogenetic tree associated with cas proteins was constructed by neighbor-joining method. the default parameter values were selected when computed.

RESULTS
architecture of crispr-cas loci in r. anatipestifer strains
in the  <dig> strains that were analyzed,  <dig> crispr loci were identified. these loci were divided into two groups, crispr <dig> and crispr <dig>  crispr <dig> was flanked by cas genes which encode for cas proteins. however, no cas genes were in the vicinity of crispr <dig>  twenty-four and  <dig> different arrays were observed for crispr <dig> and crispr <dig>  respectively. twenty of the analyzed strains contained both loci , while the other strains contained only one locus, ie, crispr <dig> or crispr <dig>  . the smallest crispr <dig> locus observed in a single strain  encompassed four spacers and five direct repeats, while the largest crispr <dig> locus occurred in rcad <dig> and contained  <dig> spacers and  <dig> repeats. on average, crispr <dig> locus was comprised of  <dig> spacers and  <dig> repeats. the smallest crispr <dig> locus contained eight spacers and nine repeats , while the largest crispr <dig> locus, which was observed in five strains , contained  <dig> spacers and  <dig> repeats. crispr <dig> locus consisted of  <dig> spacers and  <dig> repeats averagely. the crispr locus information is displayed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the distance between crispr <dig> and crispr <dig> varied from strain to strain, approximately from  <dig> to 800 kb. there were only three cas genes  located upstream of the crispr <dig> locus . the region between the cas <dig> gene and the first direct repeat was a 107 bp-long non-coding sequence and was defined as the putative leader sequence of crispr <dig> . we found a 16 nt-long anti-repeat sequence, ‘tgaaagcaattcacaa’, which was located upstream of cas <dig> gene in all crispr1-containg strains and was considered to be a part of the sequence that encodes for a putative tracrrna .fig.  <dig> graphic representation of crispr-cas loci in r. anatipestifer strains. the black blocks represent crispr loci. at-rich leader sequences  are located upstream of crispr <dig>  there are three cas genes  which are closed to crispr <dig>  shown as white boxed arrows. upstream of cas <dig>  there is a 16 nt-long anti-repeat sequence, which might be considered as a portion of the sequence that encodes for a putative tracrrna . the distance between crispr <dig> and crispr <dig> is long and varies from strain to strain, thus the sequence between the two loci is omitted and is represented by a double-slash



the prediction of leader sequences
according to previous reports, the leader sequence located upstream of the first crispr repeat is rich in a/t bases and is up to 650 bp long . in addition, the leader sequence lacks an orf and contains a palindromic sequence. the leader sequence has also been shown to be conserved in the same species, and is a probable recognition sequence for the insertion of new spacers  <cit> . it may also act as a promoter for crispr locus . we defined the 107 bp-long non-coding sequence between the cas <dig> gene and the first repeat as the putative leader sequence of crispr <dig>  all of the predicted leader sequences were compared using clustalx . the putative leader sequences showed significant similarities between each of the analyzed strains, apart from ra-ch- <dig>  ch <dig>  rcad <dig>  and rcad <dig>  the latter strains harbored  <dig> snps in each of the putative leaders, and the snps that were hosted in these strains were identical. the putative leaders contained an obviously long palindromic sequence, ‘aaacccattgcaatgggttt’, separated by 5 bp . the gc content of the putative leaders was 25 %, while that of r. anatipestifer genomes was observed to be 35 % . several promotors were predicted, and the promoter that was predicted to have the highest score  was located between  <dig> and 62 bp in the 107 bp putative leader sequence.fig.  <dig> multiple sequence alignment of putative leader sequences and the first repeats. the putative leader sequence  and the first repeat  of each crispr <dig> locus in analyzed strains were selected for multiple sequence alignment. the nucleotide sequences of the first repeats are framed by black box. the grey shadow and arrow indicate the palindromic sequence in leaders. the asterisk represents the conserved base in all of the sequences for alignment



characteristics of direct repeat sequences
it has previously been reported that the length of conserved repeats varies from  <dig> to 48 nt  <cit> . these sequences have also been shown to contain palindromes. the 5’ terminal portion of a repeat is normally composed of the sequence gttt  and the 3’ terminus contains the sequence gaaa   <cit> . generally, repeats associated with the type ii system are weakly palindromic, and are typically 36 nt in length  <cit> . the two crispr loci in r. anatipestifer strains had different consensus direct repeat sequences and varied with respect to both length and content . the length of the crispr <dig> consensus direct repeats was 47 nt, while the length of the crispr <dig> repeats was 36 nt. the consensus direct repeats associated with crispr <dig> contained a conserved 5’-gttg terminus and a 3’-gcaac terminus. a conserved 5’-gttg terminus and a 3’-ccaac terminus were present in crispr <dig>  the direct repeat variants  were observed as part of this analysis. two cases of drvs  occurred in the consensus direct repeats of crispr <dig>  both variants were observed in the crispr <dig> repeats of yb <dig>  ra-gd, and rcad <dig>  similarly, a20g and c27t drvs were observed in crispr <dig>  a20g appeared in the crispr <dig> repeats of strain  <dig>  strain  <dig>  ra-ch- <dig>  rcad <dig>  rcad <dig>  rcad <dig>  rcad <dig>  rcad <dig>  and rcad <dig>  while c27t occurred in rcad <dig>  rcad <dig>  and rcad <dig> fig.  <dig> features of repeats in r. anatipestifer crispr loci. a and d show sequence logo for consensus direct repeats associated with crispr <dig> in  <dig> r. anatipestifer strains and sequence logo for consensus direct repeats associated with crispr <dig> in five r. anatipestifer strains, respectively. the height of the letters indicates the relative frequency of the corresponding base at that position. b and c display predicted secondary structure of the crispr <dig> consensus direct repeats. the putative secondary structure of consensus direct repeats containing the t23c and g39a variants is shown in c, e, f and g display predicted secondary structure of the crispr <dig> consensus direct repeats. the putative secondary structures of consensus direct repeats containing the c27t variant and a20g variant are shown in  and , respectively



the predicted secondary structures of the consensus direct repeats of crispr <dig> and crispr <dig> are shown in fig.  <dig>  a large number of the repeats in crispr <dig> were involved in a long stem-loop structure that was interrupted by a shorter stem-loop. repeats containing the t23c and g39a variants produced similar secondary structures with only minimal size deviations noted for the two previously mentioned stem-loop structures. the majority of repeats in crispr <dig> had a large loop next to a small loop, while repeats containing the c27t drv produced a small loop with a long stem only. repeats in crispr <dig> that had been shown to contain the a20g drv, showed more complicated stem-loop structures, which were characterized by two stem-loops occurring at a larger loop .

spacer organization
the main differences of crispr loci occurred due to spacer organization diversity. spacer sequences derived from foreign nucleic acid sequences , have been shown to insert into crispr locus in the acquisition step. moreover, it has been confirmed that new spacers generally integrate into the leader-proximal terminus  <cit> . thus, the organization of spacers is likely to be reflective of the degree of evolution associated with crispr-cas immune defense systems.

synthetically considering the similarity of the crispr arrays and the phylogeny of the strains , crispr <dig> arrays can be divided into seven subgroups, and crispr <dig> arrays into five subgroups. and then we analyzed spacer organization in the same subgroup. the crispr <dig> and crispr <dig> loci with repeats eliminated are indicated in figs.  <dig> and  <dig> fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis by bpga based on pangenome for  <dig> r. anatipestifer strains

fig.  <dig> spacer organization in crispr <dig>  the crispr <dig> arrays from  <dig> r. anatipestifer strains are graphic represented. in order to analyze conveniently, the repeats have been eliminated and only the spacers are shown. the different subgroups are separated by the dotted lines. all arrays in the same subgroup are aligned manually. the abscissa indicates serial numbers of spacers, and ordinate displays names of analyzed r. anatipestifer strains. the direction of spacers is consistent with serial numbers . identical spacers are displayed by the same color, and are aligned such that they have the same number . additionally, unique spacer is displayed by a unique combination of color and number

fig.  <dig> spacer organization in crispr <dig>  the crispr <dig> arrays from  <dig> r. anatipestifer strains are graphic represented as in fig.  <dig>  the asterisk represents the spacer with large size



of the crispr loci that were analyzed as part of this study,  <dig> different spacers were observed. on average, the number of spacers observed in a locus was  <dig> and  <dig> for crispr <dig> and crispr <dig>  respectively. the crispr <dig> spacers were observed to be 29–30 nt in length, while the crispr <dig> spacers were 29–82 nt . apart from yb <dig>  the crispr <dig> arrays possessed spacers with extreme sizes occurred in all crispr2-containing strains. interestingly, distinct 3– <dig> crispr <dig> spacers with large size usually localized in terminal of the array in succession .

spacer loss occurred in both crispr <dig> and crispr <dig> . moreover, the majority of disparities associated with crispr <dig> arrays resulted from the loss of one or more spacers. spacer loss was observed to occur in two different formats: loss of two or more successive spacers , and discontinuous loss .

given the mechanisms that underpin spacer acquisition, the spacers in a crispr array differ from each other. however, there is an exception to this occurrence. on occasion, two or more tandem spacers are identical because of duplication events. duplication of spacers was observed in both crispr <dig> and crispr <dig> . spacer duplication resulted in either a singularly copied unit , or a single spacer duplicated multiple times .

as part of this analysis, we observed the presence of unique spacers that only occur in individual strains in the same subgroup. sixty-three unique spacers were found in the crispr loci that were analyzed in total,  <dig> and  <dig> for crispr <dig> and crispr <dig>  respectively . unique crispr <dig> spacers were present in rcad <dig> , rcad <dig>  and rcad <dig> . each of these spacers was composed of a unique nucleotide sequence. in crispr <dig>  we observed  <dig> unique spacers, characterized by the presence of either two or more contiguous spacers , or a single sequence . the majority of the unique spacers were located at the leader-proximal terminus. this would suggest that these spacers were derived following spacer acquisition.

interestingly, the spacer organization of rcad <dig> crispr <dig> was identical to rcad <dig>  additionally, the same case was observed in rcad <dig>  ra-ch- <dig>  strain  <dig>  rcad <dig> and rcad0183; ra-gd, dsm <dig> and atcc11845; strain  <dig> and rcad <dig> . conversely, this phenomenon was rare in crispr <dig>  ie, only the spacer organization of dsm <dig> crispr <dig> and that of atcc <dig> were identical . this finding was in agreement with the number of unique spacers of the two loci. overall, the spacer organization of crispr <dig> was more diverse than that of crispr <dig> 

furthermore, the spacer organization was varied from subgroup to subgroup. combined with analysis of the phylogenetic tree of these strains , we found the subgroups of crispr <dig> spacer organization could be correlated roughly with the clusters of the phylogenetic tree , while this connection was weak in crispr <dig> . the subgroups of spacer organization in crispr <dig> was not completely consistent with phylogeny on account of some exceptions as follow: first, from the phylogenetic tree, it was clear to see rcad <dig> was closely related to rcad <dig> which possessed crispr <dig> locus, but it did not harbor the locus; second, the spacer organization was similar in rcad <dig>  rcad <dig>  rcad <dig> and rcad <dig>  but the four strains were distributed in distinct clades; third, rcad <dig>  rcad <dig>  rcad <dig> and yb <dig> were clustered in the phylogenetic tree, while their spacer organization were not grouped in the same subgroup, the same observation was made for strain  <dig> and ra-gd.

identification of phage/plasmid protospacers
given that spacers play a significant role in defense mechanisms that are elicited against cognate foreign nucleic acids , we next analyzed whether r. anatipestifer spacers contained homology with phage or plasmid sequences. crisprtarget was used to identify putative protospacers  <cit> , and hits that showed ≥87 % identity  were deemed to be significant. as mentioned above,  <dig> spacers were identified in the  <dig> loci that were analyzed. of these, only 8 %  of the spacer were similar to known phage or plasmid nucleotide sequences. twelve of these thirteen spacers were located in crispr <dig> . the putative protospacers were present in the genomes of enterobacteria phage phi <dig>  riemerella phage rap <dig> and plasmids of azospirillum brasilense, deferribacter desulfuricans and pantoea sp. at-9b. the sequences that showed homology with riemerella phage rap <dig> usually displayed a perfect match, with more than one match being observed in one locus  . there were two putative protospacers with identical identity for spacer  <dig>  the same observation was made for spacer  <dig> table  <dig> identification of phage/plasmid protospacers

we also analyzed whether the putative protospacers displayed conserved pam sequences. the protospacers with flanking sequence  were extracted and aligned. unfortunately, whether in 5’ terminal or 3’ terminal, there was no obviously conserved motif. the t at 54th position was relatively conserved .fig.  <dig> prediction of pam consensus sequence. the numbers associated with protospacer sequence are framed by red box. the height of the letters indicates the relative frequency of the corresponding base at that position



characteristics of the cas operon
as previously mentioned, only three cas genes were observed upstream of crispr <dig>  and no cas genes were found proximal to crispr <dig>  therefore, this analysis focused on the cas <dig>  cas <dig>  and cas <dig> genes that adjacent to crispr <dig>  previous reports have published analysis of the cas <dig>  <cit>  and cas <dig>  <cit>  genes in the r. anatipestifer reference strain, atcc  <dig>  in this study, we performed an extensive analysis on the cas operon of all of the analyzed r. anatipestifer strains.

the cas operon was composed of cas <dig>  cas <dig> and cas <dig>  this was consistent with a type-ii system   <cit>  . there was a 12 bp-long interval between cas <dig> and cas <dig>  while cas <dig> and cas <dig> had an 11 bp-long overlap. the length of the cas <dig> gene was observed to be identical in all of the strains analyzed. the same observation was made for cas <dig>  on average, the size of predicted orfs for cas <dig> genes was 897 bp and the gc content was 36 %. the cas <dig> gene was predicted to translate a protein composed of  <dig> amino acids. the predicted orf for cas <dig> was 336 bp in length and the gc content was 36 %. the putative protein encoded by cas <dig> constituted a protein of  <dig> amino acids. cas <dig> and cas <dig> are the core proteins of the crispr-cas system, and both are conserved in one species  <cit> . to determine whether the two cas proteins are conserved in the r. anatipestifer strains, we performed multiple sequence alignments with the predicted amino acid sequences for cas <dig> and cas <dig>  respectively. the results indicated that cas <dig> was identical in the r. anatipestifer strains that were analyzed . cas <dig> proteins can be divided into two groups with identical sequences. the cas <dig> of the four strains  were the same, and the rest of the strains had identical amino acid sequence for cas <dig>  but in general, cas <dig> was still remarkably similar in these analyzed strains .

differences in the cas operon predominantly occurred in the cas <dig> gene. the majority of cas <dig> genes were 4200 bp in length, and encoded proteins composed of  <dig> amino acids. however, exceptions existed. for example, the cas <dig> gene of ra-ch- <dig>  ch <dig>  and rcad <dig> was 4215 bp. this gene translated into a protein of  <dig> amino acids. additionally, the rcad <dig> cas <dig> gene was 4227 bp and the associated translation product was  <dig> amino acids sequence. similar to the observations pertaining to cas <dig>  diversity in cas <dig> predicted amino acid sequences occurred in the four strains, ie ra-ch- <dig>  ch <dig>  rcad <dig> and rcad <dig> . although multiple sequence alignments associated with this protein indicated that there was so much variation in the four strains that were mentioned above, intact hnh and ruvc-like domains with conserved catalytic sites were present in all of the analyzed cas <dig> protein sequences .

it has been reported that a phylogenetic analysis of cas <dig> in  <dig> representative type ii systems is consistent with the classification of type ii systems characterized to date  <cit> . in order to observe the evolutionary relationship of cas <dig> protein sequences between r. anatipestifer and other type ii system-containing strains and determine the type of r. anatipestifer crispr-cas system, we selected  <dig> cas <dig> amino acid sequences from gram-negative type ii system-containing bacteria and ra-ch- <dig> for analysis. next, we constructed a multiple sequence alignment and a phylogenetic tree for cas <dig> . the phylogenetic tree  showed that the cas <dig> sequence from r. anatipestifer was closely related to that of bacteroides fragilis nctc  <dig> and formed part of the subtype ii-c subcluster.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree for cas <dig> from  <dig> gram-negative type ii system-containing bacteria. cas <dig> proteins from  <dig> gram-negative type ii system-containing bacteria were selected for analysis . a phylogenetic tree based on cas <dig> proteins from ra-ch- <dig> and  <dig> gram-negative type ii system-containing bacteria was constructed by neighbor-joining method using mega software . the bootstrap values of each node are shown. different subclusters are enclosed by distinct brackets, and is in accordance with subtypes of type ii system. the r. anatipestifer strain, ra-ch- <dig>  is in red



discussion
in this study, the structural characteristics and components associated with r. anatipestifer crispr-cas systems were analyzed. based on previous studies, we observed that the crispr1-cas locus in r. anatipestifer is highly similar to subtype ii-c. firstly, the crispr1-cas locus possessed the minimal number of cas genes required to formulate the cas operon, which is a characteristic of subtype ii-c  <cit> . secondly, repeats of type ii systems are predominantly 36 nt in length, while the repeats of r. anatipestifer crispr <dig> were 47 nt. this is in agreement with the finding that unusually long repeats  are exclusively present in type ii-c systems, especially in the bacteroidetes phylum  <cit> . additionally, the r. anatipestifer cas <dig> protein was obviously a member of the subtype ii-c subcluster . these observations suggest that the crispr1-cas system of r. anatipestifer is a type ii-c system.

compared with the relatively conserved repeats and cas genes, the spacer organization in r. anatipestifer was more diverse as a consequence of spacer acquisition. in crispr <dig>  new spacers were typically inserted into the putative leader sequence-proximal end. this occurrence resulted in older and more conserved spacers being located in the leader-distal end, and numerous unique spacers were located in the leader-proximal end. by contrast, the spacer organization in crispr <dig> appears to be more stable. by inference, the crispr <dig> loci of r. anatipestifer are likely to have lost adaptive abilities during evolution. although the reasons that have led to the occurrence of this phenomenon are currently unknown, similar observations have been made in salmonella  <cit> . intriguingly, the spacer organization of crispr arrays were not completely in agreement with the phylogenetic analysis of analyzed r. anatipestifer strains, suggesting that horizontal gene transfer  associated with crispr loci among r. anatipestifer strains had occurred.

interestingly, the four strains  were distinguished from other analyzed strains in putative leader sequence and amino acid sequences of cas <dig> and cas <dig>  this finding is consistent with the phylogeny of r. anatipestifer strains, namely, the four strains were clustered in the phylogenetic tree of r. anatipestifer strains. however, we cannot explain why there were minor variations and whether these variations impact biological activity of these elements at present. nevertheless, two distinct endonuclease domains – hnh and ruvc-like, which both are essential for the cleavage function of cas <dig>  <cit>  were present in each analyzed cas <dig> protein sequence, though there was so much variation in the sequences.

the tracrrna is critical for processing and interference activities associated with type ii systems  <cit> . the repeat portion of pre-crrna and the anti-repeat portion of tracrrna pair up to form tracrrna:pre-crrna duplex in the presence of cas <dig>  and then the duplex is co-processed by the host factor rnase iii. the mature crrna  guides cas <dig> to cleavage target dna during the interference step  <cit> . however, the tracrrna is difficult to identify due to the diversity of sequence length, content, structure and localization  <cit> . therefore, we can only predict the anti-repeat sequence of tracrrna-encoding dna by analyzing the conservative form of base-pairing that is utilized by these repeat sequences. upstream of the cas operon, where crispr <dig> was located, there was a 16 nt-long anti-repeat sequence, which might be regarded as a portion of the sequence that encodes for a putative tracrrna. as mentioned above, the repeat sequence was comprised of  <dig> nucleotides, so the mismatches in repeat sequence may be combined with other factors or the 16 nt-long sequence is just sufficient for following activities. likewise, the mismatches in tracrrna-encoding sequence may be bound to other factors or form secondary structure to maintain structural stability. given the complementarity between pre-crrna and tracrrna, the repeat sequences of the type ii system are weakly palindromic. in other words, the repeat itself is not likely to form stem-loop structure that is deemed essential to pre-crrna maturation in type i and iii systems  <cit> . intriguingly, the repeat sequences in r. anatipestifer showed ordinary stem-loop structures, though there were some differences in the secondary structures resulting from drvs.

however, the molecular mechanisms elicited by subtype ii-c are likely to be different from those that underpin type ii systems. it has been confirmed that a streamlined type ii-c system occurred in neisseria meningitides  <cit> . in this system, the crispr locus was devoid of identifiable leader sequences containing external promoters, but possessed functional promoters embedded within each repeat. moreover, rnase iii-mediated processing was dispensable due to immediate transcription of short crrnas from internal promoters in the repeats. conversely, potential promoters were not found in the repeats of r. anatipestifer crispr <dig>  additionally, we predicted  the occurrence of 107 bp-long leader sequences containing several putative promoters upstream of the crispr <dig> arrays. palindromic sequences were also found in the putative leaders. taken together, we speculate that the pre-crrna processing pathway of the r. anatipestifer type ii-c system is distinguishable from that of n. meningitides. further analysis of rna-seq is required to provide a more detailed insight into the actual molecular mechanism that underpins the type ii-c system in r. anatipestifer. the crispr-cas system is an adaptive immune system in prokaryotes that promotes the protection of bacteria and archaea from invasion by phages and plasmids . thus, we identified putative protospacers homologous with the spacers of r. anatipestifer. the only phage to share complete identity with the analyzed spacers was the phage of r. anatipestifer   <cit> . this suggests that the r. anatipestifer strains which contain the spacers homologous to rap <dig> were likely infected by a phage related to rap <dig>  or a common ancestor have been attacked by the phage and transferred the spacer to its descendants. therefore, these strains are likely resistant to the phage related to rap <dig>  and we need to identify the biological activity by experiment. it is possible that the spacers harbor identity with other r. anatipestifer bacteriophages, but many of these bacteriophages have not yet been characterized. this is likely because crispr-cas system-mediated immunity leads to difficult isolation of r. anatipestifer phages. other analyzed spacers matched foreign fragments derived from plasmids of azospirillum brasilense, deferribacter desulfuricans and pantoea sp. at-9b, suggesting that r. anatipestifer might has hosted to these genetic elements or similar elements. unfortunately, we found no consensus sequence associated with pam in silico, which perhaps resulted from insufficient putative protospacers, and we may be able to discover functional pam via experimental measures  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified the structural characteristics and components of r. anatipestifer crispr-cas system with comparative genomics analysis. the crispr1-cas system of r. anatipestifer can be classified as subtype ii-c, while the neighborless crispr <dig> with smaller variance could be inactive. the polymorphism of spacer organization may reflect the process of adaptation in r. anatipestifer. the features of the components associated with crispr1-cas system suggest a distinct molecular mechanism utilized by r. anatipestifer. this research may assist in studying the specific mechanism associated with crispr-mediated adaptive immunity and other biological functions in r. anatipestifer.
