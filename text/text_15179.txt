BACKGROUND
fungal biocontrol agents, which are widespread and environmentally safe, have great potential in integrated pest management. however, the application of entomopathogenic fungi such as metarhizium acridum in the field has been held back owing to their poor efficacy  <cit> . during the infection process of entomopathogenic fungi, germ tubes are produced after the fungal conidia attach to the insect cuticle, and then differentiate into swollen infection structures called appressoria. the appressoria produce penetration pegs, which penetrate the host cuticle via a combination of mechanical pressure and cuticle degrading enzymes, before piercing the surface of the host into the blood cavity. they produce a large number of hyphae through budding, thereby exhausting the nutrition of the insect host  <cit> . during the course of fungal infection, pathogenic fungi encounter various adverse factors from the host insect, such as antifungal substances on the cuticle  <cit> , oxidative stress during infection  <cit> , osmotic stress inside the host body  <cit> , behavioral changes, such as locust fever during the early infection stage  <cit> , and environmental stresses, including heat shock and uv radiation  <cit> . research on the regulatory processes involved in response to adverse factors from the host and environment is essential for the commercial development and improvement of fungi as biocontrol agents.

as major regulators of virulence determinants, the signal transduction pathways of fungal pathogens have been extensively researched. in fungi and yeasts, the camp  signaling cascade has been co-opted for a multitude of cellular processes and development. camp regulates morphogenesis and virulence in a variety of fungi  <cit> . adenylyl cyclase anchored in membrane is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of atp to camp  <cit> . recent studies indicate that adenylate cyclase is required for normal vegetative growth, infection structure formation and virulence in phytopathogenic fungi. the role of adenylate cyclase enzymes has been investigated in several fungal species  <cit> . magnaporthe oryzae depleted of adenylate cyclase  was incapable of penetrating the surface of susceptible rice leaves because it could not form appressoria  <cit> . in the post-harvest necrotrophic fungus botrytis cinerea, the deletion of the gene encoding adenylate cyclase reduced intracellular camp levels, causing delayed vegetative growth, lesion development and in planta sporulation  <cit> . an adenylate cyclase  deletion mutant in sclerotinia sclerotiorum exhibited aberrations in sclerotial initiation, possessed altered oxalate levels, and showed reduced virulence due to the lack of infection cushion formation  <cit> . targeted disruption of the adenylate cyclase-coding gene in fusarium proliferatum retarded vegetative growth, increased conidiation and delayed conidial germination  <cit> . although adenylate cyclase plays various roles in a number of fungi, the function of adenylate cyclase in entomopathogenic fungi has not been explored up to date.

in this study, we cloned the full-length cdna of adenylate cyclase from the locust-specific m. acridum strain, cqma  <dig>  designated maac. the maac transcript level of m. acridum was knocked-down by rnai and the roles of maac in pathogenicity and tolerance to stresses were analyzed. our results showed that maac contributed to vegetative growth, virulence and tolerance to various adverse host insect and environmental factors. the results demonstrated that impairment in the virulence of the maac rnai mutant was caused by decreased vegetative growth and tolerance to adverse conditions encountered during host infection.

RESULTS
isolation and characteristics of maac
a  <dig>  bp of cdna encoding adenylate cyclase  was isolated and sequenced . alignment with the dna sequence showed that the maac gene contained an open reading frame  and was interrupted by two introns located at the n terminus  and the c terminus . the complete orf of maac encoded a predicted protein of  <dig>  amino acids  with a molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. an analysis using signalp suggested that the n-terminal sequence of maac had no signal peptide. the predicted protein had a high similarity to the adenylate cyclase gene  of metarhizium anisopliae , the adenylate cyclase gene of cordyceps militaris , mac <dig> of m. oryzae  and sac <dig> of s. sclerotiorum . a fungal phylogenetic tree was established using mega  <dig>  . maac was most similar to the sequence of the entomopathogenic fungus m. anisopliae, belonging to the sordariomycetes. all species were members of the subdivision pezizomycotina in the division ascomycota.

knocked-down maac transcription by rnai
we conducted an rna interference  strategy to study the function of maac. phosphinothricin-resistant transformants of m. acridum were generated by transformation with the vector pk2-pb-maac-rnai . to investigate the efficiency of rnai, the wild type and rnai mutants of maac were analyzed by quantitative rt-pcr. compared to the wild type, maac transcription in the rnai mutants was downregulated by  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . these results demonstrated that the transcription of maac was efficiently knocked down.

maac affects growth in vitro
the phenotypes of the maac rnai mutants in vitro were analyzed on pda and czapek-dox medium . a variety of morphological abnormalities were observed in the maac rnai mutants. on pda, the growth of the maac rnai mutants was reduced, mycelium formation was delayed, and the colonies of rnai mutants were smaller compared to the wild type. on czapek-dox medium, the conidiation of the maac rnai mutants was also delayed, and the colonies of rnai mutants were lighter in comparison to the wild type. the ac-rnai- <dig> mutant had the most significant difference compared to the wild type, and was used as the maac rnai mutant in the following experiments.

vegetative growth in vitro was further quantified by assaying the living cells in pd liquid culture by celltiter 96® aqueous one solution assay . in contrast to the wild type, the growth rate of the ac-rnai- <dig> mutant was similar to the wild type, while the other four rna mutants grew conspicuously slowly . these results indicated that maac affects growth in vitro. the correlation coefficient of the relative expression rate and the growth rate was  <dig> , which was highly significant . these result showed that the growth rate is related to the relative expression rate of maac.

maac regulates intracellular camp levels in m. acridum
as shown in this study, the fungal growth of the maac rnai mutant of m. acridum was significantly slower in vitro than that of the wild type. in order to assess whether the growth defect of the rnai mutant was due to reduced levels of camp, we quantified and compared the steady-state levels of camp in pd liquid culture. the camp level was significantly reduced in the ac-rnai- <dig> mutant compared to the wild type  and the camp concentration of the maac rnai mutant  was approximately two-fold less than that of the wild type  after being cultured for  <dig> h . this demonstrated that maac was involved in camp production during the vegetative growth of m. acridum. this was further confirmed by the exogenous addition of camp  to the rnai mutant. as shown in figure  <dig>  the rnai mutant grown in the presence of 8-br-camp showed a great increase in aerial hyphal growth. thus, exogenous camp could restore the growth of the rnai mutant, which suggested that maac was involved in camp synthesis.

maac is required for in vivo virulence and growth
differences in virulence and invasive growth inside insects were also compared between the wild type and rnai mutant. figure 6a shows that,  <dig> days post-inoculation on the pronotum, locusts infected by the wild type fungus began to die, while those infected by the rnai mutant died  <dig> day later. figure 6b shows that when the insects were inoculated by the injection of conidia into abdominal segments, the locusts began to die  <dig> days after injection of the wild type, and again the insects treated with the conidia of rnai mutant died  <dig> day later. accordingly, the lethal time value for 50% mortality  by topical inoculation and injection of the rnai mutant was significantly higher than that of the wild type  , which indicated that maac is required for m. acridum virulence.

to confirm the effect of maac on virulence, fungal growth in vivo was observed by photomicroscopy and quantified by real-time pcr. the m. acridum mutant grew significantly more slowly than the wild type , which was further confirmed by a quantitative assay. here, the fungal dna of the wild type was conspicuously higher  than that of the rnai mutant . fungal growth cultured in the haemolymph of the locusta in vitro was also observed by photomicroscopy, which showed that the rnai mutant grew evidently more slowly than the wild type . taken together, these results demonstrate that maac affects fungal growth both in vivo and in vitro.

maac is involved in the tolerance of m. acridum to oxidative stress and osmotic stress
in order to clarify the mechanisms by which maac affect the virulence and growth in vivo, the osmosensitivity and h2o <dig> tolerance of conidia were analyzed. firstly, 1/ <dig> sday was chosen as a base medium, on which these strains grew with no difference  <dig> d post-inoculation . however, rnai mutants were more sensitive to osmotic stress, and the rnai mutants colonies were sparse in contrast to the dense ones of the wild type on 1/ <dig> sday + kcl  . the effect of externally applied h2o <dig> on the wild type and rnai mutants was also tested . the most striking differences between the response of the wild type and rnai mutants was observed in 1/ <dig> sday containing  <dig> mm h2o <dig>  where the colonies of the rnai mutants were sparser than the wild type colonies. these results indicated that maac is involved in the tolerance of m. acridum to both oxidative and osmotic stresses.

maac affects the tolerance to heat and uv light
the tolerance levels of conidia to heat and uv light were analyzed to clarify the function of maac. after wet-heat exposure at 45°c, the germination rate of conidia declined with increasing exposure times, and the conidia germination rates of the wild type strain and mutants appeared to be significantly reduced for each successive 30-min interval . however, the response to tolerance was obviously different for the wild type strain and rnai mutant. the conidia germination rate of the wild type strain was higher than that of the mutant. in particular, there was a significant difference at  <dig> h and  <dig>  h . similar results were observed with the uv-b tolerance test . exposure to uv-b for 1– <dig> h caused a significant difference in the germination rate of conidia between the wild type and rnai mutant . these result indicated that the rnai mutant was more sensitive to uv-b treatment than the wild type. therefore, maac appears to affect the tolerance of m. acridum to heat and uv.

discussion
adenylate cyclase regulates a variety of physiological processes in phytopathogenic fungi, including conidiation, conidial germination, vegetative growth, appressoria formation and virulence. in this study, an adenylate cyclase gene, maac, was identified in a locust-specific entomopathogenic fungus, m. acridum. bioinformatic analysis showed that the cloned maac had significant similarity to its homolog from m. oryzae and to many other fungal adenylate cyclase genes; the highest degree of similarity was found with the adenylate cyclase of m. anisopliae . the camp level of the maac rnai mutant was significantly reduced, and the exogenous addition of camp could restore the growth of the rnai mutant, thus confirming that the maac gene encodes adenylate cyclase in m. acridum. these results were similar to previous studies on other fungi  <cit> . following the deletion of the entire sac <dig> coding sequence of s. sclerotiorum <cit> , camp underwent a four-fold reduction in the sac <dig> deletion strain compared to the wild type. in bac1- and uac1-defective mutants, intracellular camp was detected, which contrasted with the wild type  <cit> .

in this report, the downregulation of maac led to inhibited growth on in vitro media, including pda and czapek-dox medium. in pd liquid culture, it caused similar effects to previously described adenylate cyclase mutants, such as the sac <dig> mutant in s. sclerotiorum <cit>  and the bac <dig> mutant in b. cinerea <cit> . furthermore, maac is also involved in the growth of m. acridum inside locusts. the virulence of the maac mutant was also significantly reduced, thus indicating that maac is required for m. acridum virulence. this finding is consistent with the role of adenylate cyclase in the virulence of other fungi, including m. oryzae <cit> , b. cinerea <cit>  and u. maydis <cit> .

previous research has demonstrated that the tolerance of fungi to stresses such as high temperature  <cit> , uv-b radiation  <cit> , oxidative  <cit>  and osmotic stress  <cit>  is a factor that limits their widespread use. the elevated thermo- and h2o2-tolerance of the Δfpacy <dig> mutants indicated that the adenylate cyclase may have negative regulatory roles on the stress response mechanisms of fungal cells  <cit> . however, the tolerance of the rnai mutant to the osmotic-, h2o2-, uv-b and thermal stress was reduced in this study, thus indicating that maac may affect the tolerance to multiple stresses through similar regulatory mechanisms in fungal cells.

maac affects virulence via controlling the rate of vegetative growth inside the host locust and the tolerance of the fungus to oxidative stress, osmotic stress and locust fever . the Δlt <dig> values of the ac-rnai mutant and the wild type after topical inoculation and injection were similar , but the germination and appressorium formation of the ac-rnai mutant was not affected . the fungal growth of the ac-rnai mutant in vivo and in vitro was slower compared to the wild type, thus resulting in a reduction of virulence as a result of the slow growth of the ac-rnai mutant in the host body. the effect of adenylate cyclase on virulence is mediated by different mechanisms in different pathogenic fungi. for example, the virulence effect of the mac <dig> mutation is due to the inability of the fungus to produce appressoria  <cit> , while the effect of the bac <dig> mutation on virulence is due to the absence of sporulation in plants  <cit> . a fungal pathogen would encounter oxidative stress during infection or osmotic stress inside the host body  <cit> , and locust fever  during the early stage of infection  <cit> . therefore, the effect of maac on stress tolerance in the host insect contributes significantly to the virulence of m. acridum.

CONCLUSIONS
