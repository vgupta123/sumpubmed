BACKGROUND
cellulose, a polymer of β- <dig> -linked glucose molecules, is the major polysaccharide component of plant cell walls and is the most abundant organic polymer on earth. many microorganisms produce cellulases to degrade cellulose in order to use it as a carbon source. for plant pathogens, the plant cell wall is the primary barrier that they need to overcome and the production of enzymes capable of degrading cellulose is therefore of critical importance for colonization of plants.

most animals  do not have endogenous cellulases and rely instead on intestinal symbiotic microorganisms for cellulose digestion. however, recent studies have shown that some insects and plant-parasitic nematodes have endogenous cellulases that degrade cellulose polymers  <cit> .

cellulases can be grouped into families based on their sequence and on the basis of hydrophobic cluster analysis  <cit> . fourteen families of glycosyl hydrolases  are known to include proteins that degrade cellulose . it is thought that proteins within each group are structurally related and are likely to have evolved from a common ancestor  <cit> .

cellulases from two distinct glycosyl hydrolase families  have been found in nematodes. gh <dig> cellulases have been found in a wide range of clade  <dig> tylenchid plant parasitic nematodes and show relatively high similarity to bacterial gh <dig> sequences, leading to the suggestion that they were acquired via horizontal gene transfer  from bacteria  <cit> . however, another plant-parasitic nematode bursaphelenchus xylophilus, which is located in clade  <dig> as described by van megen et al.  <cit>  and is not directly related to the clade  <dig> tylenchid plant parasites, has gh <dig> cellulases rather than gh <dig>  <cit> . these two gh families show little amino acid similarity to each other and have distinct kinetic mechanisms, catalytic residues and three dimensional structures although both catalyze the breakdown of similar substrate; cellulose and hemicelluloses  <cit> .

the origin of the nematode gh <dig> cellulases remains unclear, although hgt from fungi seems likely given the high similarity to fungal gh <dig> cellulases and the absence of sequences resembling gh <dig> cellulases from all other nematodes analysed to date.

bursaphelenchus xylophilus is the causal agent of pine wilt disease  <cit> . in their pathogenic life cycle the nematode is transmitted from trees killed by pine-wilt to healthy pines by vector beetles. once the nematodes enter the tree, they feed on plant cells in the tree, leading disruption of pine tissues and lethal wilt. as the pine wilts and dies, the nematodes start to feed on fungi that invade the dying tree. furthermore, most bursaphelenchus species are solely fungal feeders and all species rely on fungi as a food source at some stage of their life cycle.

in this study we have conducted a wide ranging screen and intensive phylogenetic analysis of gh45-like sequences in nematodes and fungi, particularly those found in association with plants. our results show a wide distribution of gh <dig> cellulases in ascomycetous fungi and a narrow but concentrated distribution in nematodes, a single lineage that includes a number of facultative plant parasites. the close relationships between the nematode and fungal sequences, as well as a shared intron position in some of the nematode and fungal sequences, suggest that nematode gh <dig> cellulases were acquired via hgt from fungi and subsequently underwent repeated duplication within nematode genomes.

RESULTS
amplification of gh <dig> cellulase sequences
genomic dna was extracted from  <dig> fungal species/strains and  <dig> nematode species/strains  and used for pcr amplification with a degenerate primer pair designed from a conserved region of known gh <dig> cellulases . clear bands were observed at around 500–2000 bp following agarose gel electrophoresis. the majority of successful amplifications were from ascomycetous fungi or bursaphelenchus nematode species. no amplification was seen with basidiomycetous fungi or distantly related  nematode species including aphelenchus avenae and pratylenchus sp., suggesting the absence of gh <dig> in these species.

sequence analysis revealed most of those fragments contained the conserved sequence of gh <dig> cellulases including two catalytic core residues  . in total we obtained  <dig> sequences from  <dig> nematode species  including b. doui, b. conicaudatus, b. purvispicularis, b. xylophilus, b. mucronatus, b. luxuriosiae, b. okinawaensis, b. kiyoharai, bursaphelenchus sp <dig>  bursaphelenchus sp <dig>  b. yongensis and b. poligraphi . ruehmaphelenchus sp. in this study and aphelenchoides besseyi <cit>  in a previous study are the only species other than bursaphelenchus species from which gh45-like sequences were identified. for fungi  <dig> gh45-like sequences were identified from  <dig> fungal species , all of which belong to ascomycota .

gene structures
the nematode gh <dig> sequences can be broadly grouped into two different intron-types, some of which were successfully confirmed by rt-pcr or rna-seq data : genes with no intron  and genes with one intron at position  <dig>  . position  <dig> introns in the nematodes varied in length from 36 bp to 220 bp . some nematode species contained more than one gh <dig> sequence and included both p <dig> and p <dig> intron-types. these species included b. xylophilus, b. doui, b. purviscularis, b. mucronatus and b. luxuriosae. we were only able to amplify one intron-type from other species: b. conicaudatus, b. kiyoharai and bursaphelenchus sp <dig> contained only gh <dig> sequences with p <dig> introns while bursaphelenchus sp <dig>  b. okinawaensis, b. yongensis, b. poligraphi and bursaphelenchus sp <dig> contained only p <dig> gh <dig> sequences. only intronless sequences were identified from ruehmaphelenchus sp.

eleven gh <dig> genes were predicted in the recently published b. xylophilus genome sequence  <cit> . six of these  <dig> genes have no intron ,  <dig> genes have introns at position  <dig>  and  <dig> genes at position  <dig>  .

eleven intron positions were found in the fungal sequences. most of the fragments contained only one intron . forty-three sequences had one intron at position  <dig>   <dig> sequences had one intron at position  <dig> and  <dig> had no intron in the amplified fragment. the intron lengths were 46 bp to 343 bp. one intron position  was shared by the nematodes and several fungal species.

phylogenetic analysis
nematode sequences
to reconstruct the evolutionary relationship between the species with successful amplified gh <dig> sequences, a phylogenetic tree was built based on nearly full length 18s ribosomal rna  gene from these species. a comprehensive list of nematodes including the superfamily aphelenchoidea, the order tylenchida and some members of cephaloboidea were used for the analysis. however, a major effort in sequences for phylogenetic reconstruction was done for members of aphelenchoidea, which harbour gh <dig> sequences .

the phylogeny of the bursaphelenchus genus is characterised by a well defined clade  which includes b. luxuriosae, b. xylophilus, b. mucronatus, b. doui, b. conicaudatus, and will be referred as the “xylophilus group” throughout the manuscript. b. kiyoharai and bursaphelenchus sp <dig> are clustered into a clade next to that of the xylophilus group . the rest of the species considered in the study are distributed throughout the different subclades formed.

phylogenetic trees of nematode gh <dig> nucleotide sequences are shown in figure  <dig> with two fungal gh <dig> sequences included as outgroup. similar topology was shown using amino acid sequences . the phylogeny revealed that the xylophilus group clustered into one large clade comprised by two well supported subclades: subclade  <dig> is comprised by sequences with intron  <dig>  and subclade  <dig> with sequences that show other intron positions . sequences from b. okinawaensis are clustered together with those from b. kiyoharai and bursaphelenchus sp <dig> which comprise a sister clade of the xylophilus group in the ssu tree. bursaphelenchus sp <dig> sequences were clustered into an independent clade at the basal position. the sequences from ruehmaphelenchus sp. were positioned inside the bursaphelenchus sequences with a long branch; a similar pattern is also observed in the ssu tree.

ten out of  <dig> b. xylophilus gh <dig> genes from the genome sequence of this species were clustered into four clades in the aforementioned large clade. these clades were composed of the following sequences: i) bx-eng- <dig> and bx-eng- <dig> with b. purvispicularis and b. mucronatus sequences; ii) s <dig> , bx-eng- <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig>  with b. purvispicularis and b. mucronatus sequences; iii) s <dig> , s <dig> , s <dig>  and s <dig>  sequences and iv) s <dig>  sequence occupying a basal position with other bursaphelenchus species sequences and a. besseyi. this close relationship between sequences for the same species is also observed for other species with the exceptions of b. yongensis and b. poligraphi from which we were able to identify only one and two gh <dig> sequences respectively.

the positions of the b. purvispicularis gh <dig> sequences differed greatly from the position of this species within the ssu phylogeny. the a. besseyi gh <dig> sequence  <cit>  was nested within the sequences from the bursaphelenchus species.

fungal sequences
a phylogenetic tree based on the large subunit ribosomal rna genes  of fungi is shown in figure  <dig>  a comprehensive set of species belonging to ascomycota ranging from sordariomycetes to saccharomycetes were included in the phylogenetic tree. the topology of the tree correlated well with previously described phylogenetic data from fungi, even though we only sequenced a single locus and some groups were not represented by a large number of species e.g.  <cit> . the sordariomycetes clade is well supported with  <dig> pp and  <dig> bs values. leotiomycetes and dothideomycetes were nearly monophyletic although patellina sp.  did not nest in the main clade. two species of eurotiomycetes were grouped and made a distinct clade with low phylogenetic values. the other representative species of each class e.g., pezizomycetes, basidiomycetes and agaricomycetes, were supported by high phylogenetic values and long branches. the fact that these species did not taxonomically correlate with previous phylogenetic data was most likely because we used only a single locus in this study.

a phylogenetic tree of gh <dig> sequences based on nucleotide sequences is shown in figure  <dig> and the phylogenetic tree based on amino acid sequences is shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  the trees of lsu and gh <dig> sequences were not completely consistent for some species, genera and classes, but showed a good consistency in general. in the phylogenetic trees of gh <dig> sequences, none of the classes we analysed were monophyletic, except for agaricomycetes. leotiomycetes was nearly monophyletic as komagataella pastoris and rhizina undulata were clustered with the leotiomycetes clade in the phylogenetic trees of gh <dig> sequences. this class is also nearly clustered as monophyletic in the phylogenetic trees of amino acid sequences. sordariomycetes were divided into two clades in the both phylogenetic trees. interestingly, the two clades showed several genera or species duplications such as pestalotiopsis glandicola, bartalinia robillardoides, monochaetia monochaeta and humicola grisea. dothideomycetes was divided into several clades that were not sorted by the general fungal taxonomy. our dothideomycetes data included four orders: dothideales, pleosporales, capnodiales, and botryosphaeriales, and none of the orders were monophyletic in the both phylogenetic trees. although we used mucoromycotina as a outgroup taxa in our trees, ustilago maydis clustered with the mucoromycotina clade.

combined tree
a broad phylogenetic tree was generated using the gh <dig> sequences from nematodes and fungi obtained in this study and other sequences from cazy database . sequences from bacteria and molluscs were not included as they are very different compared to sequences from other organisms . the ml best tree showed a monophyletic clade for nematodes and also for protists and insects, while the fungi sequences are distributed into several separated clades. however, the clades formed are weakly supported with the exception of prostists and insects. deep clades are usually well supported in our analysis. some sequences from fungi were located in the nematoda clade . a fungal clade which is most closely related to the nematode sequences and on the basal position of the nematode clade in the tree  consisted of sequences from sordariomycetes fungi . another fungal clade positioned next to insect clade  was made up of fungi belonging to mucoromycotina and basidiomycetes.

discussion
in this study we have identified  <dig> and  <dig> novel gh45-like sequences from nematodes and fungi respectively, as a result of a wide range screening programme. this is equivalent to two thirds of the eukaryotic gh <dig> genes previously described . most of these sequences are from species for which there was no prior knowledge of gh <dig> cellulases. this study has therefore greatly increased the available information about distribution of gh <dig> sequences in eukaryotes.

our study suggests distribution of gh <dig> genes in nematodes is likely to be restricted in a single phylogenetic group that includes the families parasitaphelenchidae and aphelenchoididae as the sequences have been found only from bursaphelenchus species, ruehmaphelenchus sp. and a. besseyi. no gh45-like sequence was detected from other nematode species including pratylenchus sp. and aphelenchus sp. by pcr amplification in this study and no sequence showing similarity to gh <dig> genes has been identified in the extensive genome, est or rna-seq sequences from any other nematodes including c. elegans, meloidogyne species and a. avenae. however, there are still many nematode genera, including plant-parasitic species, which have not yet been subjected to detailed analysis. the possibility that other species which have not yet been analysed also have gh45-like sequences therefore remains.

in fungi, gh <dig> sequences were found from a variety of ascomycota species, ranging from sordariomycetes to saccharomycetes. only a small number of gh <dig> sequences have previously been reported from basidiomycetous fungi and no pcr amplification of these sequences was observed from any of the basidiomycetous fungi used in this study, suggesting gh <dig> genes were more widely distributed in ascomycota than in basidiomycota. the phylogenetic trees of fungal gh <dig> sequences showed good consistency with the lsu tree in terms of species relationships, although some duplications in gh <dig> sequences were observed in some specific clades and they show a nested structure in the tree. therefore it seems likely the gh <dig> genes were inherited vertically and evolved from a common ancestor of these fungi. currently seven phyla in the kingdom fungi are proposed: microsporidia, chrytridiomycota, blastocladiomycota, neocallimastigomycota, glomeromycota, ascomycota, and basidiomycota  <cit> . in this study we used large numbers of species mainly from two big fungal groups . it would be interesting to investigate distributions of gh <dig> genes in other phyla as they still remain unclear.

the phylogenetic trees of nematode gh <dig> sequences showed a more complex structure than those of the fungi. the fact that several different copies of the genes are present within each individual nematode makes it difficult to interpret the phylogenetic trees. for example, we found  <dig> distinct gh <dig> sequences in b. luxuriosae and b. purvispicularis and in each case subsets of these sequences are nested with sequences from other species within the trees . in addition we observe several small clusters comprised by multiple sequences from one species within the tree . these patterns are consistent with an initial expansion of the gene family in the common ancestor of the bursaphelenchus genus followed by further expansions within individual clades and species.

the genome sequence of b. xylophilus revealed the species has  <dig> gh <dig> genes in the genome  <cit>  and in our tree they were separated into  <dig> clusters . this adds further weight to the suggestion that expansions have occurred both before and after speciation. some of those genes have another intron position  that was not found in other nematode species using pcr screening, suggesting p <dig> genes in other species might be missed in the pcr process possibly because of primer mismatches. a more complete set of cellulase genes of these nematode species will enable a more detailed analysis of the evolution of these genes in nematodes.

despite the complex structures of the phylogenetic trees generated there is some correlation between the phylogeny based on rdna ssu sequences and the gh <dig> trees. a phylogenetic clade in the gh <dig> trees which includes the xylophilus group and a clade with b. kiyoharai and bursaphelenchus sp <dig> are both well supported and these clades are also well supported in the tree obtained using ssu rdna. this again suggests the distribution of gh <dig> cellulases in bursaphelenchus species is originated from a common ancestor followed by expansions of the genes during the evolution.

we found two interesting inconsistencies between the gh <dig> tree and the ssu tree. gh <dig> sequences of b. parvispicularis are clustered together with those from the xylophilus group while the ssu of the species is phylogenetically closer to bark beetle/weevil associates . although we do not have a clear explanation for this inconsistency, this might be related with their biological characters, e.g., carrier insect and habitat environments. the species in the xylophilus group are associated with cerambycid beetles and inhabit relatively deep wood , and the other smaller insect associates inhabit shallow wood . although the detailed life history of b. parvispicularis has not been examined, the habitat preference might be closer to that of the xylophilus group. the detailed biological analysis of b. parvispicularis may give an insight into the function of these genes in relation to nematodes’ biological characters.

the gh <dig> sequence from a. besseyi is in a closer position to the sequences from the bursaphelenchus species than those from ruehmaphelenchus sp. in the tree. as seen in the ssu tree, a. besseyi is thought to be more distantly related to bursaphelenchus species than other aphelenchus and ruehmaphelenchus species . aphelenchoides species are mainly fungal-feeders and are thought to have less association with plants than bursaphelenchus. however, a. besseyi is one of a few species which are known to be parasitic to plants. it would be interesting to examine gh <dig> genes in other aphelenchoides species to have insights into the evolution of parasitism in this nematode genus.

gh <dig> sequences are widely represented in other organisms including bacteria, protists, insects and molluscs  <cit> . sequences from molluscs and bacteria were excluded from this analysis because of their low sequence similarities to gh <dig> sequences from other species. the genes from these groups are thought to comprise a subfamily within the gh <dig> family. our broad phylogeny of gh <dig> sequences showed a clear grouping of organisms in the best tree obtained . sequences from insects and protists presented monophyletic clades in the tree. taking into account of the position of nematodes in the tree and the presence of the genes in ruehmaphelenchus sp. and a. besseyi it is possible that the hgt event that gave rise to gh <dig> sequences in nematodes occurred in an early ancestral species in aphelenchoidea from a close contact with ascomycota fungi species as previously suggested  <cit> . we hypothesise that the nematodes acquired gh <dig> genes from one of sordariomycetous fungi as sequences from these fungi are located at the basal position of the all nematode sequences in the tree . the majority of the aphelenchoidea species are fungal-feeders and some of the species live in a densely fungal populated environment.

the gh <dig> sequences from fungal species  are clustered with the sequences from the nematoda. this is difficult to explain and may have arisen due to an artifact or, more speculatively, due to sequence changes reflecting functional restrictions on the cellulases within these species.

the nematode gh <dig> sequences described here have three types of intron positions . intriguingly position  <dig> is shared by the nematodes and some fungi. although introns have high mutation rates, making it difficult to trace lineages through sequence similarity, their positions are well conserved and can provide strong evidence to support conclusions on the origins of the genes  <cit> . therefore the fact that nematode and fungal genes share an intron position in some cases suggests a common origin of these genes. indeed most of the fungal species  that possess this intron position belong to letiomycetes and cluster into one clade in the tree . in addition, the aforementioned sequences from sordariomycetes fungi  also have a position  <dig> intron as well as genes with no intron. this can be a support for the hypothesis that the source of the nematode genes is likely to be a sordariomycetes fungus.

another family of cellulases is represented in other groups of plant-parasitic nematodes. all members of clade  <dig> of phylum nematoda analysed to date harbor one or multiple gh <dig> cellulases  <cit> . in the tylenchid plant parasites this family of gh <dig> cellulases is thought to have been derived from bacteria  <cit>  while in the case of pristonchus spp.  the gh <dig> sequences present are more likely to have been acquired from an amoebozoan or related microorganism  <cit> . the presence of gh <dig> has also been identified in the fungivorous nematode a. avenae <cit> . the phylogenetic position of this species was controversial until recently but now it is clearly accepted that aphelenchus is more closely related to tylenchida than to aphelenchoides and bursaphelenchus based on the comprehensive molecular phylogenetic study by van megen et al.  <cit> . our tree also supports this phylogenetic position .

bursaphelenchus species are likely to have gh <dig> cellulases regardless of their pathogenicity to plants. the only species proven to be pathogenic in natural conditions from our dataset of studied sequences is b. xylophilus <cit> , with only a few other species demonstrated as weak disease agents under certain environmental conditions  <cit> . most other species, including ruehmaphelenchus, are associated only with dead trees. our finding of the widespread occurrence of gh <dig> cellulases across the bursaphelenchus genus and in a closely related genus  suggests gh <dig> cellulases are used by nematodes to soften the cell walls of plants regardless of whether the nematode is a pathogen or simply a fungal feeder that moves through dead plants to locate food.

CONCLUSIONS
it used to be believed that animals  do not have endogenous cellulase  and rely on their symbiotic microorganisms for cellulose digestion. however, it is now clear that some invertebrate species, including nematodes, have endogenous cellulase genes which produce enzymes to digest cellulose.

in order to investigate distribution and evolution of gh <dig> cellulase genes in nematodes and fungi we performed a wide ranging screen and intensive phylogenetic analysis of gh <dig> sequences. we identified  <dig> novel sequences from a small group of nematode species and  <dig> from a wide variety of ascomycetous fungi, indicating a wide distribution of gh <dig> cellulases in ascomycetous fungi and so far been found in a single major nematode lineage. the close relationships between the sequences from nematodes and ascomycetous fungi, as well as the conserved gene structures gave us the reasonable hypothesis that nematode gh <dig> cellulase genes were acquired via hgt from fungi probably belonging to class sordariomycetes.
