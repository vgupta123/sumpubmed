BACKGROUND
transition from vegetative to reproductive growth is one of the most important developmental switches in plant's life cycle. in annual plants, like arabidopsis, flowering and consequent seed production is essential for the survival of the population until the following season. to assure timely flowering in various environments, arabidopsis utilizes several genetic pathways that are activated by various external or internal cues. light and temperature, acting through photoperiod, light quality, vernalization and ambient temperature pathways, are the most important environmental factors regulating flowering time  <cit> . moreover, gibberellin  and autonomous pathways promote flowering by responding to internal cues  <cit> . in contrast to annual plants, the growth of perennials continues after generative reproduction, and the same developmental program is repeated from year to year. regulation of generative development in these species is even more complex, because other processes like juvenility, winter dormancy and chilling are tightly linked to the control of flowering time.

in arabidopsis photoperiodic flowering pathway, phytochrome  and cryptochrome  photoreceptors perceive surrounding light signals and reset the circadian clock feedback loop, including toc <dig> , cca <dig>  and lhy   <cit> . the central feature in the photoperiodic flowering is the clock generated evening peak of co  gene expression  <cit> . in long-day  conditions, co peak coincidences with light resulting in accumulation of co protein in the leaf phloem and consequent activation of the expression of ft   <cit> . ft protein, in turn, moves to the shoot apex, and together with fd triggers floral initiation by activating floral identity gene ap <dig>   <cit> . ft, together with soc <dig>  and lfy  form also convergence points for different flowering pathways, and therefore are called flowering integrator genes  <cit> .

in winter-annual ecotypes of arabidopsis, mads-box gene flc  prevents flowering by repressing ft and soc <dig>  and vernalization is needed to nullify its function  <cit> . the major activator of flc is fri   <cit> , but several other proteins, including for example frl <dig>   <cit> , pie   <cit> , elf <dig> and elf <dig>   <cit> , and vip <dig>   <cit>  are also needed to maintain high flc expression. during vernalization, flc is down-regulated by vrn2-prc <dig>  protein complex containing low temperature activated vin <dig> , allowing plants to flower  <cit> .

autonomous and ga pathways respond to endogenous cues to regulate flowering time. the role of the autonomous pathway is to promote flowering by lowering the basal level of flc transcription  <cit> . autonomous pathway consists of few sub-pathways, which include for example rna processing factors encoded by fca, fpa, flk , fy and ld   <cit> , putative histone demethylases ldl <dig> and ldl <dig>   <cit> , and deacetylases fld  and fve  <cit> . ga pathway is needed to induce lfy transcription and flowering in short-day  conditions  <cit> .

strawberries  are perennial rosette plants, belonging to the economically important rosaceae family. most genotypes of garden strawberry  and wild strawberry  are junebearing sd plants, which are induced to flowering in decreasing photoperiod in autumn  <cit> . in some genotypes, flowering induction is also promoted by decreasing temperatures that may override the effect of the photoperiod  <cit> . in contrast to promotion of flowering by decreasing photoperiod and temperature, these "autumn signals" have opposite effect on vegetative growth. petiole elongation decreases after a few days, and later, around the floral transition, runner initiation ceases and branch crowns are formed from the axillary buds of the crown  <cit> . crown branching has a strong effect on cropping potential as it provides meristems that are able to initiate inflorescences  <cit> .

in addition to sd plants, everbearing  genotypes are found in garden strawberry and in wild strawberry  <cit> . environmental regulation of induction of flowering in eb genotypes has been a topic of debate for a long time. several authors have reported that these genotypes are day-neutral  <cit> . recent findings, however, show that long-day  accelerates flowering in several eb fragaria genotypes  <cit> . interestingly, in wild strawberry genotype 'baron solemacher' recessive alleles of sfl gene locus  have been shown to cause eb flowering habit  <cit> . sfl has not been cloned, but it seems to encode a central repressor of flowering in wild strawberry. consistent with the repressor theory, ld grown strawberries have been shown to produce a mobile floral inhibitor that is able to move from mother plant to the attached runner plant  <cit> . ga is one candidate corresponding to this inhibitor, since exogenously applied ga has been shown to repress flowering in strawberries  <cit> .

identification of central genes regulating flowering time and eb flowering habit, as well as those controlling other processes affecting flowering, is an important goal that would greatly accelerate breeding of strawberry and other soft fruit and fruit species of rosaceae family. in this paper, we have searched fragaria homologs with the known arabidopsis flowering time genes by est sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. dozens of putative flowering genes corresponding to all known genetic pathways regulating flowering time were identified. the expression analysis of several candidate flowering time genes revealed only few differences between the sd and eb wild strawberries, including the presence or absence of ap <dig> mrna in the apices of eb and sd genotypes, respectively. our data provides groundwork for detailed studies of flowering time control in fragaria using transcriptomics, functional genomics and qtl mapping.

RESULTS
environmental regulation of flowering in two eb genotypes of wild strawberry
we studied the effect of photoperiod and temperature on flowering time in two eb genotypes, 'baron solemacher', which contains recessive alleles in sfl locus  <cit> , and 'hawaii-4'. flowering time was determined by counting the number of leaves in the main crown before formation of the terminal inflorescence. in sd genotypes of the wild strawberry, sd  or, alternatively, low temperature  is needed to induce flowering  <cit> . in eb genotypes 'baron solemacher' and 'rugen', instead, ld and high temperature has been shown to accelerate generative development  <cit> , but careful analysis of the environmental regulation of flowering induction has so far been lacking.

both 'baron solemacher' and 'hawaii-4' produced five to six leaves in ld at 18°c before the emergence of the terminal inflorescence showing that they are very early-flowering in favorable conditions . in 'baron solemacher', low temperature  or sd treatment for five weeks at 18°c clearly delayed flowering, but low temperature did not have an additional effect on flowering time in sd. also in 'hawaii-4', sd and low temperature delayed flowering, but all treatments differed from each other. compared to the corresponding ld treatment, sd at 18°c doubled the number of leaves, and low temperature  delayed flowering time by about three leaves in both photoperiods. thus, flowering induction in these eb genotypes is oppositely regulated by photoperiod and temperature than previously shown for the sd genotypes  <cit> .

construction and sequencing of subtracted cdna libraries
we constructed two subtracted cdna libraries from ld grown eb genotype 'baron solemacher' and sd genotype, in order to identify differentially expressed flowering time genes in these genotypes. plants were grown in ld conditions, where the sd genotype stays vegetative and the eb plants show early flowering. pooled shoot apex sample covering the floral initiation period was collected from the eb genotype, and vegetative apices of the same age were sampled from the sd genotype. suppression subtractive hybridization , the method developed for extraction of differentially expressed genes between two samples  <cit> , was used to enrich either flowering promoting or flowering inhibiting transcripts from eb and sd genotypes, respectively.

a total of  <dig> ests was sequenced from the library enriched with the genes of the sd genotype  and  <dig> ests from the library enriched with the eb genes .  <dig> sd ests  and  <dig> eb ests  passed quality checking. pairwise comparison of these est datasets revealed that there was very little overlap between the libraries. however, general distribution of the sequences to functional categories  did not reveal any major differences between the two libraries .

blastx searches against arabidopsis, swissprot and non-redundant databases showed that over 70% of the ests gave a match in one or all of the three databases . moreover, tblastx comparison with different genomes revealed highest number of hits with populus trichocarpa . we also performed tblastx searches against tigr plant transcript assemblies of malus × domestica, oryza sativa and vitis vinifera and found hits for 64-76% of ests in these assemblies. finally, the comparison of our sequences with a current fragaria unigene list at the genome database for rosaceae  showed that  <dig> % of our ests are novel fragaria transcripts. taken together, depending on the analysis, 15-22% of sequences from sd genotype and 22-27% of eb sequences encode novel proteins, or originate from untranslated regions of mrna. moreover, the high number of novel fragaria sequences in our libraries indicates that ssh method efficiently enriched rare transcripts in the libraries.

identification of flowering time genes
flowering related genes were identified from our libraries by blastx searches as described above and fourteen putative flowering time regulators were identified; four gene homologs were present only in eb library, eight in sd library, and two genes in both libraries. in figure  <dig>  we have summarized the arabidopsis flowering pathways and highlighted the putative homologous genes identified from our est collection. in general, candidate genes for all major pathways were identified. in addition,  <dig> arabidopsis flowering time genes were used as a query to search publicly available gdr fragaria est and est contig databases using tblastn. sequences passing cut-off value of 1e- <dig> were further analysed by blastx algorithm against arabidopsis protein database, and those returning original arabidopsis protein were listed. moreover, sequences that were absent from fragaria databases were similarly searched from gdr rosaceae est database. in these searches,  <dig> additional fragaria sequences were identified. moreover, the total number of  <dig> homologs of arabidopsis flowering time genes were found among all available rosaceae sequences .

most genes of the arabidopsis photoperiodic pathway were found also in fragaria, and some of the lacking genes were present among rosaceae ests . we found several genes encoding putative fragaria photoreceptor apoproteins including phya, phyc, cry <dig>  ztl  and fkf <dig>   <cit> . of the central circadian clock genes, homologs of lhy and toc <dig>  <cit>  were present in our est libraries and gdr, respectively, but cca <dig>  <cit>  was lacking from both fragaria and rosaceae databases. furthermore, a putative fragaria co from the flowering regulating output pathway has been cloned earlier  <cit> . among the regulators of co transcription and protein stability, gi   <cit>  was identified from rosaceae and putative cop <dig>  spa <dig> and spa <dig>  <cit>  from fragaria. in addition to genes of the photoperiodic pathway, homologs for both known sequences belonging to light quality pathways, pft <dig>  and hrb <dig>   <cit> , were found from our est libraries.

for the vernalization pathway, we were not able to find flc-like sequences from our est libraries or public fragaria or rosaceae est databases by tblastn searches although we used the flc and flc-like sequences from arabidopsis  and several other plant species as query sequences  <cit> . similarly, also fri  <cit>  was lacking from rosaceae ests but putative frl   <cit>  sequences were identified in fragaria. in addition, we identified several gene homologs belonging to the fri complex as well as other regulatory complexes  involved in promoting the expression of flc   <cit> . also putative members of flc repressing prc <dig> complex, were present in strawberry ests. these include putative vin <dig>   <cit>  that has been identified earlier  <cit> , and putative swn <dig> , fie , vrn <dig>  and lhp <dig>   <cit> , which were found in this investigation . however, putative vrn <dig> that is needed for the repression of flc by prc <dig> was not found  <cit> .

in addition to the photoperiod and the vernalization pathways, we searched candidate genes for the autonomous and ga pathways. several sequences corresponding to arabidopsis genes from both pathways were identified suggesting the presence of these pathways also in fragaria . among these genes we found homologs for arabidopsis fve and svp which have been shown to control flowering in a specific thermosensory pathway  <cit> . moreover, some additional flowering time regulators that are not placed to any specific pathway were identified .

identification of floral integrator genes in fragaria
sequencing of our est collections did not reveal any homologs for the floral integrator or identity genes such as ft, soc <dig>  lfy or ap <dig>  <cit> . a full-length cdna sequence of soc <dig> homolog  and a  <dig> bp 3'-end fragment of putative lfy  were isolated using pcr. closest protein homolog of the putative fvsoc <dig> was 72% identical populus trichocarpa mads <dig>  and the putative fvlfy showed highest amino acid identity  to malus domestica fl <dig>  comparison to arabidopsis showed that atsoc <dig> and atlfy, respectively, were 66% and 75% identical with the corresponding wild strawberry protein sequences . ft homolog, instead, was not identified in fragaria despite of many attempts using degenerate pcr and screening of cdna library plaques and e.coli clones from a variety of tissues and developmental conditions with the arabidopsis coding sequence . however, a putative ft was found in prunus and malus protein databases at ncbi. among the other genes belonging to the same gene family, homologs of mft  and atc   <cit>  were present in gdr fragaria est. moreover, an est contig corresponding to the floral identity gene ap <dig> was found. the length of the translated protein sequence of fvap <dig> was  <dig> amino acids, being  <dig> amino acids longer than the corresponding arabidopsis sequence. however, fvap <dig> est contig contained an unknown sequence stretch of  <dig> bp at nucleotide position 596- <dig>  putative fvap <dig> showed highest overall identity  with putative ap <dig> from prunus persica . moreover, the 5' sequence containing  <dig> amino acids  was 73% identical with the arabidopsis ap <dig> 

gene expression analysis revealed few differences between eb and sd genotypes
we compared the expression of selected flowering time genes  corresponding to each flowering pathway in the leaf and shoot apex samples of eb and sd genotypes in order to explore the role of different pathways. only few of the analysed genes were differentially expressed between the genotypes. floral integrator gene lfy was slightly up-regulated in the shoot apex samples of eb . moreover, pcr expression analysis with two different primer pairs showed that ap <dig> was specifically expressed in eb apices correlating with the identity of the meristems. among the genes from different flowering pathways, only two genes, vernalization pathway gene elf <dig>  <cit>  and photoperiod pathway gene elf <dig>  <cit> , were slightly differentially expressed between the genotypes .

tmvalue of the primers is  <dig> ± 1°c.

relative gene expression in the shoot apex or leaf samples of ld grown plants of eb genotype compared to sd genotype. ct values of genes of interest were normalized against ctvalues of msi <dig> and fve to get normalized Δct values. the expression ratios between genotypes  were calculated from the formula 2Δcteb/2Δctsd. values are mean ± standard deviation. pooled shoot apex samples and leaf samples at four leaf stage were used.

developmental regulation of floral integrator, floral identity, and ga pathway genes
we analysed the developmental regulation of ap <dig>  lfy, soc <dig>  ga3ox and ga2ox transcription in the shoot apices of ld grown plants of eb and sd genotype containing one to four leaves. ubiquitin, used as a control gene, was stable between different developmental stages, but was amplified ~ <dig> pcr cycle earlier in sd genotype . thus direct comparison between the genotypes is not possible, but the trends during development are comparable. three genes, ap <dig>  lfy, and ga3ox, had clear developmental stage dependent expression pattern in eb apices, showing biggest changes after one or two leaf stage . the expression of ap <dig> was detected in eb apices already at one leaf stage, and its mrna accumulated gradually reaching 6-fold increase at two leaf stage and 50-fold increase at four leaf stage . in parallel, transcription of lfy started to increase at 2-leaf stage, but the change in its expression was much smaller . a floral integrator gene, soc <dig>  in contrast, did not show clear developmental regulation . also ga pathway was co-regulated with ap <dig> and lfy, since ga biosynthetic gene ga3ox was strongly down-regulated after two leaf stage . in addition, ga catabolism gene, ga2ox, tended to follow changes in the expression of ga3ox, although the results were not so clear . in sd genotype, in contrast, ap <dig> was absent and other genes did not show clear developmental regulation . in this experiment, control plants of eb genotype flowered very early, after producing  <dig>  ±  <dig>  leaves to the main crown, whereas plants of sd genotype remained vegetative.

discussion
identification of flowering genes in strawberry
genetic regulation of flowering in strawberry has earlier been studied only by crossing experiments. according to weebadde et al.  <cit> , everbearing character is a polygenic trait in garden strawberry whereas other studies indicate the presence of a single dominant gene  <cit> . different results may arise from different origin of everbearing habit, since at least three different sources have been used in strawberry breeding  <cit> . studies in f. vesca 'baron solemacher'have shown that eb flowering habit in this genotype is controlled by recessive alleles of a single locus, called seasonal flowering locus   <cit> . identification of central genes regulating flowering, as well as those controlling other processes that affect flowering , is an important goal that would greatly accelerate breeding of strawberry and other soft fruit and fruit species of rosaceae family.

for comprehensive identification of candidate genes of the strawberry flowering pathways, we searched homologs for  <dig> arabidopsis flowering time genes from our own cdna libraries and from gdr. in total, we were able to identify  <dig> gene homologs among about  <dig> est sequences. moreover, gene homologs lacking from fragaria were further mined from rosaceae est collections containing about  <dig>  <dig> est sequences. these searches revealed  <dig> additional putative flowering time genes in rosaceae. ongoing genome sequencing projects in apple, peach and wild strawberry will ultimately reveal the currently lacking flowering regulators in these species  <cit> .

sequences found in fragaria corresponded to all known arabidopsis flowering time pathways  <cit>  suggesting that all of these genetic pathways may be present in fragaria. however, the sequence conservation does not necessarily mean functional conservation, so major candidate genes from different pathways have to be functionally characterized in order to prove the presence of these pathways in strawberry. few central regulators of flowering time are lacking from fragaria sequence collections and some of them also from rosaceae databases. for example, we were not able to identify a homolog for the florigen gene ft  <cit>  in fragaria regardless of several different attempts. this is probably due to its low expression level and tissue specific expression pattern  <cit> . similarly, gi, which links circadian clock and co  <cit> , was absent from the fragaria sequences. ft and gi homologs were, however, found in apple and prunus, showing that they are present in rosaceae. moreover, consistent with studies in model legumes  <cit> , cca <dig> was lacking in rosaceae, but its redundant paralog, lhy, is represented by few ests in fragaria. cca <dig> and lhy are myb-type transcription factors which repress the expression of toc <dig> in the central loop of arabidopsis circadian clock  <cit> . thus, in fragaria and other species of rosaceae family, lhy alone may control the expression of toc <dig> in the clock core. this contrasts with other species, like populus, where duplications of the lhy/cca <dig> genes contribute to an apparently more complex mode of clock control  <cit> .

vernalization pathway in arabidopsis culminates in flc and flc-like floral repressors  <cit> . they have been functionally characterized only in brassicaceae  <cit> , although homologous mads box genes have been recently found from several eudicot lineages by phylogenetic analysis  <cit> . however, we were not able to identify flc-like sequences in rosaceae by using several flc-like sequences as a query. similarly, also fri homologs were lacking from the rosaceae sequence collections. however, putative homologs of fri-like genes, frl <dig> and frl <dig>  which are involved in flc activation in arabidopsis  <cit>  were found, as well as several other homologs of genes belonging to flc regulating protein complexes. despite the presence of these transcripts, the presence of flc is unclear, since at least prc <dig> complex has several target genes  <cit> . cloning and characterization of putative flc-like and fri genes as well as ft in strawberry would greatly expand our understanding of strawberry flowering pathways, and therefore, it is one of the most important targets of further studies. if these transcripts are present in strawberry, it is likely that the precise control of flowering has placed their expression in specific tissues or contexts where they are not easily detected. however, their presence should be substantiated in analysis of the impending genome sequence. another important goal is the identification of putative rosaceae or fragaria specific flowering time genes. ultimately, transcriptomics studies and functional analysis of central genes may reveal how different flowering pathways, which may be closely related to arabidopsis pathways, make seasonal flowering in strawberry.

what is the sfl gene?
sfl is a single dominant locus that enforces seasonal flowering habit in wild strawberry, and homozygous mutation in this locus leads to continuous flowering habit in at least one genotype, 'baron solemacher'  <cit> . in sd genotypes of wild strawberry, sd or low temperature induce flowering  <cit>  probably by overcoming the function of sfl repressor gene. we showed here that eb genotypes 'baron solemacher' and 'hawaii-4' produce only  <dig> -  <dig> leaves to the main crown before the formation of the terminal inflorescence in ld at 18°c. hence, flowering induction in these conditions occurs soon after germination. in sd  or at low temperature  instead, plants formed several leaves more before the inflorescence. this finding shows that, in contrast to sd genotypes, both sd and low temperature restrain flowering induction in these genotypes, confirming earlier suggestions that eb genotypes of wild strawberry are in fact ld plants  <cit> . most simple explanation for these opposite environmental responses is that the lack of flowering inhibitor, produced by active sfl gene, unmasks ld induced flowering promotion pathway in 'baron solemacher' and possibly in other eb genotypes. given that both sd and low temperature repress sfl, analogous flowering regulating pathway has not yet been characterized at molecular level.

our gene expression analysis did not give any hints of the putative location of sfl in wild strawberry flowering pathways. however, homologs of certain flowering repressors can be consireded as candidates for sfl, including the rice co homolog hd <dig> , or arabidopsis vernalization pathway genes flc and fri  <cit> . in strawberry, the role of vernalization pathway remains unclear until the presence or absence of fri or flc function is confirmed or other targets for this pathway are found. strawberry co, instead, has been cloned and mapped in fragaria reference map, but its position does not match with the genomic location of sfl showing that co itself is not sfl  <cit> . however, the possibility that some regulator of co transcription or protein stability could be sfl cannot be ruled out and should be studied further.

exogenously applied ga inhibits flowering in wild strawberry, and therefore, ga has been suggested to be a floral repressor  <cit> . similar patterns have been observed and delineate differences between recurrent and non-recurrent roses  <cit> . however, we did not find clear differences in the expression of ga biosynthetic and catabolism genes, ga3ox and ga2ox, in the shoot apex samples of eb and sd genotypes before the floral initiation had occurred. in contrast, ga3ox was strongly repressed in eb apices after floral initiation and ga2ox showed similar trend. the fact that these changes in ga pathway occurred after two leaf stage suggests that ga signal was regulated during early flower development rather than during floral transition. these data does not support the role of endogenous ga as the regulator of flowering induction, indicating that sfl is not situated in the ga pathway. however, quantitative analysis of ga levels is needed to show whether the observed changes in the expression of ga pathway genes are reflected at the metabolic level.

ap <dig> is a potential marker of floral initiation in strawberry
gene expression analysis revealed that two putative flowering genes, ap <dig> and lfy, were co-regulated during floral development in eb wild strawberry. the homolog of floral identity gene ap <dig> was expressed in the eb apex already at one leaf stage, and its expression was strongly enhanced during later developmental stages. also lfy mrna accumulated along with ap <dig> during floral development in eb genotype, whereas soc <dig> did not show a clear trend. the mrna of soc <dig> and lfy were present also in sd genotype, but ap <dig> transcription was not detected. in arabidopsis, lfy and ap <dig> activate each other's expression constituting a feedback loop  <cit> . moreover, ap <dig> is activated by ft-fd heterodimer shortly after flowering induction  <cit> . thus, the expression patterns of ap1and lfy in the meristems of eb genotype suggest that flowering induction in these plants occurs before two leaf stage in ld conditions. consistent with this conclusion, flower initials were clearly visible by stereomicroscope in the meristems at three or four leaf stage, and plants flowered after producing on average  <dig>  leaves in the main crown. based on our results, ap <dig> can be used as a marker for floral initiation in wild strawberry. however, functional studies are needed to confirm the role of ap <dig>  lfy and soc <dig> as floral integrator and identity genes, and this approach is currently going on.

CONCLUSIONS
we have explored putative components for the genetic flowering pathways in perennial sd plant wild strawberry by identifying  <dig> homologs of arabidopsis flowering time genes. although few central genes are lacking, these data indicate that all known genetic flowering pathways may be present in fragaria. this is consistent with the finding that eb genotypes, 'hawaii-4' and 'baron solemacher', show similar environmental regulation of flowering than arabidopsis summer-annuals. we also studied the expression of selected candidate genes and found that few genes were co-regulated in the shoot apex of the eb genotype during early floral development. most strikingly, the mrna of ap <dig> specifically accumulated in eb genotype, but was absent in sd genotype, showing its usefulness as a marker of floral initiation. finally, identification of putative flowering time genes reported here enables their transcriptional and functional characterization, as well as genetic mapping, which may give answers for the relative importance of each genetic flowering pathway and lead to cloning of the central repressor gene, sfl. ultimately, these genetic resources could be utilized in cultivar breeding of various species of rosaceae family through genetic transformation and marker assisted selection breeding.
