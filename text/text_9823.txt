BACKGROUND
members of potato type ii proteinase inhibitor family  are one of the major serine proteinase inhibitor families which are mainly found in higher plants from solanaceae families  <cit> . the accumulations of pot ii inhibitors are always in response to stress, infection and wounding. they are one important measurement for plants to defense against predators or diseases. intensive researches have been conducted on proteinase inhibitors  from this family. interesting phenomena in pot ii family  make this family a good example to study gene evolution and protein folding. members within this family have been identified with different numbers of tandem sequence repeat units , such as two  <cit> , three  <cit> , four  <cit> , six  <cit> , seven  <cit>  and eight  <cit>  rus. each ru can be characterized as a ~50-residue-long 8-cysteine polypeptide, which includes a reactive site targeting serine proteinases. the evolution of several members of this multi-domain family, at the gene duplication level, has been reported  in  <dig>  however, the complex correspondence between sequence repeats and their 3d structure and the molecular adaptation within this family has not been well investigated.

several 3d structures of the pot ii family are known  <cit> , belonging to the plant proteinase inhibitors family by scop   <cit>  fold family of plant proteinase inhibitors. the plant proteinase inhibitor family rus adopts a variety of structural repeats, by circular permutation of the same fold  <cit> . structures exhibited by naturally occurring proteins are single- or double-chain permutated domains composed of n- and c-terminal segments from sequence repeats. the engineered putative ancestral domain protein alone has a fold corresponding to the sequence repeat unit  <cit> .

we have investigated the correlation between sequence and structural repeats within this family using sequence, structural and phylogenetic analyses, with the putative ancestral domain sequence as the basic repeat unit. systematic analysis of pot ii family using bioinformatic approaches has revealed many interesting findings, of which the significant is the selection of the permuted structural domain as the preferred structural repeat unit, since it ensures the viability of proteinase inhibitory activity even as the native protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage.

RESULTS
protein 3d structures analysis of pot ii family
all the identified 3d structures of the pot ii family were classified into plant proteinase inhibitors family by scop  <cit> . among these structures, only 1fyb and 1pju are two-domain pis while the rest have a single domain. all these structures have little secondary structure and are restrained principally by four disulphide bridges in each domain, and the main secondary structure in their folds is an anti-parallel 3-stranded β-sheet on the face opposite to the reactive site loop.

the sequence alignment of domains of the pot ii family structures  suggests that the sequences of all domains can mainly be divided into two parts, named here as the h- and l-fragments  connected by linker- <dig> or linker- <dig>  in most structures, the l-fragment forms the reactive loop and one strand of the β-sheet, while the h-fragment forms a loop and two strands.

from figure  <dig>  clearly all the structures share the same disulfide connectivity although the combination of the h- and l-fragments is different. these domains can be divided into three types based the existence of two linkers :  h-l type : with structural examples, 4sgb-i, 1tih, 1fybc, 1fybt and 1pju2;  l-h type : the engineered protein 1ce3;  h+l type : 1qh <dig> and 1pju <dig> 

the three structures shown in figure  <dig> are actually the circular permutations of the same fold. all three topologies have the β-sheet and the functional proteinase inhibitory site conserved, although the intra-fragment connectivities are different. the h+l structure  can be considered the basic fold, with linker- <dig> between c <dig> and n <dig> in 4sgb-i and linker- <dig> between c <dig> and n <dig> in 1ce <dig>  the existence of the h+l structure shows the viability of a two-chain protease inhibitor in this fold family.

for an individual single-domain pot ii protein, it could only have one topology from the three possible topologies depending on its primary sequence. but for a multi-ru pot ii protein, theoretically there are two possible domain organizations:  tandem repeat domain organization;  circularly permuted domain organization. for tandem repeat domain organization, the domains are arranged in beads-on-a-string way. each domain is equivalent to the sequence repeat and adopts l-h topology. while for circularly permuted domain organization, the n- and c-termini are connected and formed one domain. in such a bracelet-like organization, the structural domains are not corresponding to the sequence repeats. the domain formed by n- and c-terminal sequences adopts h+l topology and other internal domains adopt h-l topology.

so the problem is: given a multi-ru pot ii protein, which kind of domain organization will it take? based on the observation of the current data set, all experimentally determined multi-domain structures have circularly permuted two-domain organization . and most single-domain pot ii pis  adopt the h-l type topology which also suggests that the multi-domain pis have circularly permuted domain organization before they were processed. the only exception is 1ce <dig>  which has only one ru in its primary sequence and thus can only adopt l-h topology, and moreover it is a engineered gene  <cit> . the abundance of h-l topology suggested it is more favourable by nature than l-h topology.

so the next question is: does h-l topology have advantage  over l-h topology? to evaluate the structure quality of different topologies and domain organization, we used several structure validation methods  to compare representative structures from each types. to facilitate the comparison, two 3-d models  of a two-ru pi, potato inhibitor ii  , were built according to tandem repeat domain organization and circularly permutated domain organization, respectively.

the structure validation methods used in this study evaluate the structure quality of protein models from different aspects. whatif packing quality control is designed to test the proper packing of protein models by evaluating atomic contacts and calculating a contact quality index  <cit> . errat detects incorrectly determined regions of protein models by analyzing the statistics of non-bonded interactions between different atom types  <cit> . the overall quality factor indicates the percentage of correctly determined regions in the protein models. proq predicts the quality of a protein model by using a neural-network-based method that based on a number of structural features  <cit>  using two different measures, lgscore  <cit>  and maxsub  <cit> . for all the methods, higher value suggests better structural quality. based on the results showed in table  <dig>  whatif packing quality control suggests that permuted structures and h-l type structures have better packing quality than tandem repeat and l-h type structures, especially for the fine packing quality control criteria. errat and proq also recommend permuted structures and h-l type topology have better structure qualities and less problematic. based on all above analyses, we believe that h-l type topology has better structure quality and is more favourable than l-h type topology. therefore multi-domain pot ii proteins should tend to fold as h-l topology domains.

the gene structure of pot ii family
gene structures can potentially provide clues for the evolution of pot ii family. in  <dig> barta and colleagues reported that the conserved gene structure for this family being two exons separated by a 100– <dig> bp type i intron   <cit> . with more sequences and genomic data available, we resurveyed the gene structure and the genomic distribution of the pot ii family genes. we first collected exon/intron organization information for all available pot ii family members. tblastn searches were carried out with pi-ii against the genbank non-redundant database as well as the oryza sativa genome and the assembled arabidopsis thaliana genome from tigr with the default parameters. all the significant hits  were combined, and only records that have complete coding sequence  information were retained. the final dataset contains  <dig> genes, and all of them come from plants. more specifically, most of them were from solanaceous family species except one entry each from arabidopsis thaliana, oryza sativa and zea mays. only  <dig> entries from the  <dig> genes have intron information available. among these  <dig> records, six are from solanum tuberosum, four from lycopersicon esculentum and one each from nicotiana tabacum, oryza sativa and arabidopsis thaliana.

the distribution and chromosomal locations of pot ii genes can provide us the insights for the gene duplication history and mechanisms of pot family. for plants, currently the whole genome sequence data is only available for arabidopsis thaliana and oryza sativa. the distribution of pot ii gene in the a. thaliana and o. sativa genome was investigated using tblastn searches. the assembled whole genome sequence for a. thaliana is available from tigr arabidopsis thaliana database . the results show that there is only one copy of the pot ii gene  in the entire a. thaliana genome, with one ru . the putative pot ii gene in o. sativa  is from whole genome shotgun sequence   <cit> . as with a. thaliana, rice has a single copy of the 1-ru pot ii gene. since there is only one copy of pot ii gene in both a. thaliana and o. sativa, the current data cannot provide us more information about the chromosomal locations of duplicated pot ii genes.

we collected the exon and intron information for all records and investigated their gene structures with the assistance of the xpro database  <cit> . interestingly, all the records have similar gene structure including putative pot ii genes from a. thaliana and o. sativa. first of all, all the records have two exons. the first exon encodes a part of the signal peptide . the second exon encodes the remaining part of the signal peptide  and the mature polypeptide. there is no intron between the rus in the genes of multi-ru sequences. secondly, the splice phases for all records are conserved as phase  <dig>  these results are consistent with the report by barta et al.  <cit> . moreover, we found that the splicing motif is also conserved and found to be gt...ag. the last nucleotide of the exon  <dig> and the first two nucleotides of exon  <dig> always encode a gly residue. the conservation of exon/intron organization, splice phase, splice motif and gly residues all confirm the homologous relationship between the identified pot ii family members. the same gene structure features are found in at-pi and os-pi, which are strongly indicative of these two are also members of the pot ii family. furthermore, we find that in all the pot ii family members lacking intron information, there is a conserved gly in a similar location in their signal peptides . these records come from a range of species of the solanaceae family, such as solanum americanum, solanum nigrum, nicotiana glutinosa, nicotiana alata and capsicum annuum. these results confirmed that this gly  in signal peptide is also a conserved feature for pot ii family.

both at-pi and os-pi have only one l-h type ru. although more than ten single-domain pi proteins  have been reported, none of them was found to be the direct translation product of a single-ru gene. on the contrary, most of them are identical to a part of multiple-domain pi precursors, indicating that these single-domain pis are proteolytic products of multiple-domain pis. considering the range of multiple-domain pis found in solanacea, gene duplication mechanism has been suggested to play an important role in the evolution of the pot ii family members, with the ancestral gene having only one ru  <cit> . the characteristics of at-pi and os-pi strongly support this hypothesis.

protein sequence analysis
we collected the protein sequences of all pot ii family members and putative pot ii pis from the ncbi non-redundant protein database and dbest database. after removing duplicates,  <dig> non-redundant protein sequences remained, with  <dig> rus. we named the rus according the following convention: total_number_repeats-accession-species-ru_number. for example, pi3-ip22_lyces-le-r <dig> represents the first repeat unit  of the 3-ru  protein, ip22_lyces  from lycopersicon esculentum . .

from the consensus sequence of the multiple sequence alignment of the  <dig> pot ii family rus, the  <dig> cys residues are fully conserved. besides these, other residues that are highly conserved are two gly residues and a pro residue , probably having important roles in stabilizing the 3d structure of the protein.

the conservation degrees of the amino acid sites of pot ii rus were estimated by a maximum likelihood method  <cit>  and mapped to a reference 3d structure  to identify functionally important regions by the program consurf  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis of pot ii family
to investigate the evolution of pot ii family genes, the phylogenetic analyses were carried out using neighbor-joining , maximum-likelihood  and bayesian inference methods, respectively. in all three trees, the taxa can be clustered into seven clades by repeat number and species. all 1-ru pis cluster into one group, and they are widely distributed in non-solanaceous plants. they are more distantly related to other members of the pot ii family and are more likely the ancestral single domain pot ii proteins. with only one ru, the sequence and the structural units are identical, with the l-h topology of 1ce <dig>  we have defined all these single-domain pis as outgroup  and re-rooted the trees. figure  <dig> shows the nj tree . the content of all clades are same in all the trees. the main difference of the three trees lies on the arrangement of clades. in all the trees, the basal branchings  are relatively weakly supported by bootstrap values or posterior probability values. in nj tree, clade  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  are clustered together , while in ml and mrbayes trees, these three clades are clustered with other clades. from current data, we cannot get better support information for the relationship between clades. in this study, our analysis does not depend on the relationship between clades and the selection among the three trees doesn't affect our analysis later. here we showed the nj tree and the other two trees are put into supplementary materials.

there are mainly three features observed in the conservation patterns .

 rus with the same repeat numbers are most similar. the 2-ru and 3-ru pi from the solanum genus  contains  <dig> sequences, from  <dig> species with total  <dig> rus, and is the largest group in this family. here, the first ru clusters into one clade as do the second ru and the third ru. this suggests the duplication events happened before the speciation, although sequence similarity cannot be detected at the dna sequence level between different repeats.

 clade  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> contain repeats that are strikingly similar to each other within the same genes. the similarity is even clearly detectable at the dna level . such pattern cannot be explained by purifying selection since the domain duplications usually loose the functional constraints and allow more mutations. the remarkable similarity suggests the existence of concerted evolution which usually can be resulted by unequal crossing over and gene conversion  <cit> .

 in clade  <dig>  we have rus from paprika that is very different to other members of the solanacae species. unlike all the other groups, the rus of the pot ii inhibitor from capsicum annuum are of the h-l type. the sequence repeat is thus identical to the structural repeat observed in potato and tomato and in nicotiana  and has no n- and c-terminal sequence segments, which form the "bracelet" link domain in other multi-ru pis . as each domain adopts the h-l domain topology, multiple-domain pis from capsicum annuum are likely to adopt tandem structural domains with a "beads-on-a-string" domain organization, which is different from all other multiple-domain pis in pot ii family. strong sequence similarity exists in this cluster at both protein and nucleotide sequence levels.

we believe that naturally isolated l-h type single-domain pis can only be derived from single-ru genes, which are present in clade  <dig>  so far recognized in rice, maize, etc. antcheva and colleagues reported the existence of a l-h type single-domain protein, psi- <dig>   <cit> . but we cannot find any multi-domain protein  contains psi- <dig>  or any nucleotide sequence  is corresponding to psi- <dig> . therefore it is still uncertain that psi- <dig>  is derived from a pot ii gene with only one l-h type ru or it is the proteolytic processing product of a multi-domain gene.

analysis of selective pressure
codon substitution models of were used to analyze pot ii genes to identify amino acid sites under diversifying selection. the models used the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio  as an indicator of selection pressure and allowed the ratio to vary among sites. the ω ratio of a site < <dig> indicates that the nonsynonymous mutations at this site are deleterious and the site is under purifying selection while ω > <dig> suggests that the nonsynonymous mutations at this site are beneficial and the site should be under purifying selection.

                              p
                              l
                              d
                              
                                 n
                              
                              /d
                              
                                 s
                              
p <dig> =  <dig> , ω <dig> =  <dig> 
p <dig> =  <dig> , ω <dig> =  <dig> 
furthermore, all models allowed positive selection  converged to the same site, site  <dig>  and site  <dig> had a high posterior probability  of being in the positively selected class in all models allowed positive selection .

statistics analyses of variation of ω among sites provide strong evidence of the positive selection. interestingly, the positively selected site  <dig> locates at p <dig> position of the reactive site of pot ii domains according the nomenclature of the schechter and berger  <cit> . for standard mechanism, canonical proteinaceous pis of serine proteinases, the specificity of the inhibitors is determined, at least in part, by a single residue at the p <dig> position  <cit> . in pot ii pi structures, the p <dig> residue contribute the largest number of contacts  <cit> . therefore, the hypervariability and positive selection of the p1residue in reactive site can be easily understood since they allow the pot ii inhibitors to provide inhibition activity to a wide range of proteinases, which help solanaceae to fight against pathogenic attacks.

we also conducted clade-wise site-based analyses in selective pressure on clade  <dig> , clade  <dig>  and clade  <dig>  in order to detect the short period of positive darwinian selection within each clades.

for all three clades, lrt tests support the existence of positive selected sites, but selective pressures among sites are quite different between clade  <dig>   <dig> and clade  <dig>  we are interested in the variable selective pressure in different clades. for clade  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> separately, we plotted the approximate posterior mean of ω ratio at each site . figure  <dig> shows that the majority of amino acid sites in clade  <dig> and clade  <dig> are under purifying or neutral selection while clade  <dig> has more amino acid sites under positive selection. in clade  <dig> and clade  <dig>  site  <dig>  was identified as statistically significant positive selected sites by all models , which is consistent with the previous analysis. while in clade  <dig>  all models support strong positive selection over site  <dig>  which is the ending residue after the proteolytic processing removing the linker  <dig> region .

such difference in selective pressure between clade  <dig>   <dig> and clade  <dig> may be due to the number of rus. for two-domain pot ii pis, the two domains can bind to two proteinases simultaneous without steric interference since the two binding sites are at opposite ends of two inhibitor domains   <cit> . while for pot ii pis with more than two domains, it becomes more and more difficult for each domain to bind a proteinase without steric hindrance. heath and co-workers reported that the six-domain precursor na-pi only has stoichiometry of  <dig>  trypsin  <cit> . so the efficiency of proteolytic processing of multi-domain pis may provide evolutionary advantages by performing better inhibition activity. this might be a possible explanation why in clade  <dig> the residue on the cleavage sites is under positive selection.

CONCLUSIONS
we have carried out systematic analysis of pot ii family on a significantly enlarged dataset comparing to the previous study by barta and colleagues  <cit> , using a wide range of bioinformatics analysis tools, leading to several interesting findings.

we classified the structural domains in pot ii family into three types  according to the existence of two linkers  between the two domain components , which clearly show the circular permutation relationship between the h-l type and l-h type topologies.

based on observed domain organization or all known sequences in pot ii family, there is a propensity in pot ii pis domain's topology to adopt the h-l topology . given that the repeat unit for most multiple-ru pot ii pis is of the l-h type, such pis will therefore fold into contiguous permuted structural domains, linked by bracelet-like structures formed by the n- and c-terminal segments from the first and the last repeat units. for pot ii genes from paprika alone, the repeat unit is of the h-l type, so that multiple-domain pis from paprika should adopt a simple tandem permuted domain architecture, with no linking bracelet structure, which is unique to the pot ii pi family.

the degree of conservation for each residue in the pot ii pis repeat units was evaluated and mapped onto the molecular surface of the structure for the putative ancestral protein, 1ce <dig>  the result shows that different regions of the protein sequences have very different mutation rates. eight fully conserved cysteines form the scaffold in the protein core, with the reactive loop and linker region being highly variable. the rapid mutation of the reactive site is consistent with the pis possessing the ability to adopt different specificities to target a wide range of proteinases. three other highly conserved residues  are located at structurally important sites β-turns and are thus critical for maintaining the pot ii domain.

phylogenetic analysis shows that the repeat units cluster into several groups according to repeat number and species. the different similarities patterns between repeat units in genes suggest that in different species the duplication history and mechanism should be different. two 3-repeat sequences from capsicum annuum have evolved to tailor the sequence repeats to correspond with the structural repeats thus eliminating the bracelet link. the repeat unit for this group is a circular permutation of the ancestral domain, making this group the late entrant to the pot ii family.

the analysis of selective pressure in pot ii domain revealed heterogeneous selective pressures among amino acid sites: the reactive site is under positive selection  while the cysteine scaffold is under purifying selection . for multi-repeat pot ii genes from nicotiana genus, the proteolytic processing site is under positive selection, which may be related to higher efficiency for cleavage.

overall, our results unravel the strategies adopted by solanaceae plants to fight against pests through the evolution of pot ii serine protease inhibitors. the duplications in both gene level and domain level enable rapid and efficient expression of pot ii genes. on the structure level, the multi-ru precursors can acquire circularly permutated structures that have a more stable and thermodynamic favourable folding. the molecular adaptation particularly the positive selection over reactive sites provides various inhibition activities targeting the broad range of pathogenic proteinases.
