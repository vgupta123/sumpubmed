BACKGROUND
flavonoids comprise a major group of secondary metabolites, which exhibit a wide range of biological functions in plants  <cit> . anthocyanin pigments and flavonol co-pigments are the two major flavonoid compounds, which serve as attractants of pollinators and seed dispersers. they also play an important role in protecting plants against abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> . anthocyanins, like other flavonoid compounds, are known as potent antioxidants  <cit> . the beneficial health roles of anthocyanins have received considerable attention as they are potentially protective factors against cancer and heart disease  <cit> . therefore, a comprehensive understanding of anthocyanin biosynthesis is important for developing foods that are rich in anthocyanins to meet the increasing demand for health-promoting components in our daily diet.

the biosynthetic pathways of anthocyanins have been well characterized  <cit>  and the corresponding genes have been isolated from various plants. in the model plant a. thaliana, the biosynthesis, regulation and transport of anthocyanins, specifically most of the structural genes and regulatory proteins involved in anthocyanin synthesis, have been identified and functionally characterized in the last two decades . these researches have played important roles in the comprehensive understanding of anthocyanin biosynthesis and revealed the accumulation and metabolic profiles of anthocyanins in a. thaliana.

brassica rapa comprises a variety of vegetables, among which chinese cabbage  and pakchoi  are the two most consumed vegetables in china and throughout east asia. b. rapa vegetables provide dietary fiber, vitamin c, and anti-cancer glucosinolates  <cit> , and are also a potentially important source of dietary flavonols  <cit> . several varieties of b. rapa are red or purple, such as some kinds of pakchoi, turnip  and zicaitai . the purple pigments in b. rapa have been identified as anthocyanins  <cit> . nevertheless, the genetic mechanism of this purple phenotype is unclear. because of the previous absence of genome information, little is known about the genes involved in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathways in b. rapa <cit> . a complete understanding of the structural and regulatory genes involved is very important for elaborating the mechanism of anthocyanin biosynthesis in b. rapa, as well as for the breeding of new b. rapa varieties rich in anthocyanins. with the reference genome and gene annotation information for b. rapa ‘chiifu’  <cit> , we now have the chance to systematically study the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes  in b. rapa.

both b. rapa and a. thaliana belong to the cruciferae family. b. rapa  has undergone whole genome triplication since its divergence from a. thaliana, followed by extensive gene loss  <cit> . in b. rapa, the level of gene loss among the three subgenomes is unequal, with one subgenome, the least fractionated  subgenome, having retained roughly 70% of its genes during fractionation after triplication, while the other two subgenomes, termed the medium and most fractionated  subgenomes, have retained much fewer genes  <cit> .

whole genome duplication  is a major way of gene copy number expansion in plants. as reported previously, gene families expanded by wgd can maintain the proper balance in biological networks or cascades  <cit> . after wgd and subsequent gene fractionation, the number of genes that respond to abiotic and biotic stresses or with membrane protein functions tends to be increased  <cit> . in b. rapa, the genes expanded through whole genome triplication  tend to come from functional categories such as transcriptional regulation, ribosomes, response to abiotic or biotic stimuli, response to hormonal stimuli, cell organization, and transporter functions  <cit> . however, no detailed information about the status of abgs after the wgt in b. rapa has been available till now. to obtain comprehensive information on the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in b. rapa and look into the effect of wgt on these genes, comparative genomic analysis between b. rapa and a. thaliana was performed here based on the reference genome of b. rapa <cit> . we present several interesting observations about the evolutionary history of abgs in b. rapa, the similarities between the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathways in a. thaliana and b. rapa, the synteny of abgs between a. thaliana and b. rapa, and the expansion and retention of abgs in b. rapa. the results of our systematic analysis of the complete set of abgs in b. rapa will promote the understanding of the genetic mechanism of anthocyanin biosynthesis and the anthocyanin profiles/accumulation in b. rapa crops.

RESULTS

bhigh sequence similarity and tandem relationship of these four at r2r3-myb genes made it difficult to define the three br genes by synteny or homology analysis. so these three genes were only listed gene code numbers without annotation names.



among the  <dig> brabgs,  <dig> were syntenic orthologs of  <dig> atabgs; only  <dig> % of brabgs had no syntenic relationship. multiple copies of brabgs in b. rapa syntenic to genes in a. thaliana were generated from the wgt, whereas  <dig> of the  <dig> atabgs had less than three syntenic orthologs as a result of gene fractionation following triplication as described above. furthermore, the amino acid sequence identities for pairs of syntenic genes  and non-syntenic genes  did not show a statistical difference. the brabgs of different functions in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway had different sequence identities to their counterparts in a. thaliana . the homologous pairs of structural genes encoding anthocyanin biosynthesis enzymes shared significantly higher amino acid identity  than those encoding transcriptional factors , which regulate the expression of structural genes , indicating that the structural genes were more highly conserved than regulatory genes. it is reasonable that excessive mutation of structural genes would likely block the biosynthesis of anthocyanins, reducing the fitness of the plant.

of the  <dig> brabgs,  <dig> were mapped to the  <dig> chromosomes of b. rapa, with three,  <dig>   <dig>  seven,  <dig>  four, six, one,  <dig>  and five brabgs located on chromosomes a01-a <dig> of b. rapa genome v <dig> , respectively . the remaining gene, bra <dig>  an ortholog of ugt79b <dig>  was anchored on scaffold <dig>  which has not yet been mapped onto a chromosome. whole genome analysis established that the three subgenomes in b. rapa could be distinguished by the degree of gene density  <cit> . with this subgenome information, we then assigned all brabgs to the three subgenomes: lf, mf <dig> and mf <dig>  in total,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes were located on lf, mf <dig> and mf <dig>  respectively. there were more genes located on lf, while almost equal numbers of genes were distributed on mf <dig> and mf <dig>  of the  <dig> syntenic orthologs,  <dig> were on lf,  <dig> were on mf <dig> and  <dig> were on mf2; the number of syntenic orthologs distributed on lf was a little less than the sum of those on mf <dig> and mf <dig>  these results show that the distribution of brabgs is consistent with the gene fractionation status at the whole genome level  <cit> . based on the determination of these brabgs, the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in b. rapa was thus established.figure  <dig>

abgs are over-retained in b. rapa
compared with a. thaliana, the b. rapa genome has undergone a whole genome triplication  <cit> . most of the abgs were present in multiple copies in b. rapa. in our study, the  <dig> brabgs represent  <dig> % of the  <dig>  predicted genes in b. rapa; accordingly, there are  <dig> atabgs genes representing  <dig> % of all a. thaliana genes. with the total numbers of a. thaliana and b. rapa genes as a background, we found that the expansion levels of structural, regulatory, and transport genes and the total number of brabgs were similar to the whole-genome gene expansion level in b. rapa . we also analyzed the number and ratio of single copy to multiple copy paralogous genes to reveal the retention status of the brabgs after the whole genome triplication. we used the ratio of total number of single to multiple copy  paralogous genes  of the whole b. rapa genome as a background  and found that the total brabgs  and regulatory genes  were significantly lower than that of the background, indicating over-retention of total and regulatory abgs in b. rapa. the structural and transport genes showed no significant difference to the background .table  <dig>

bthe ratio of single to multiple copies is the number of paralogs having one copy versus the total number of paralogs with two and three copies.


cthe proportion of total paralogous sets with different copy numbers over the whole genome was used as a background to calculate the p-value using fisher’s test. the “*” represents a p-value less than  <dig> , which means the ratio of single to multiple copies of these kinds of anthocyanin pathway genes shows a significant difference from the background.



the anthocyanin biosynthetic structural genes have expanded through whole genome and tandem duplication in b. rapa
gene copy numbers can be expanded in four major ways: wgd, tandem duplication , segmental duplication, and gene transposition duplication  <cit> . we found that the structural brabgs were expanded through both wgd and td. we identified  <dig> brabg structural genes as homologs of  <dig> atabg structural genes. the almost-doubled number of homologs indicated that anthocyanin biosynthetic structural genes were expanded in b. rapa. of the  <dig> structural genes,  <dig> were located at  <dig> loci that had syntenic relationships to  <dig> atabg structural gene loci. among the  <dig> syntenic orthologs,  <dig> brabgs came from six tandem arrays, which accounted for about 30% of all structural genes in b. rapa. these data showed that both td and wgt contributed to the expansion of anthocyanin biosynthetic structural genes in b. rapa. the  <dig> genes were distributed in different subgenomes of b. rapa, with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes located on lf, mf <dig> and mf <dig>  respectively, and one gene not anchored on any chromosome in the current version of the b. rapa genome.

anthocyanins are derived from branches of the flavonoid pathway, which starts with phenylalanine via the general phenylpropanoid pathway. the phenylpropanoid pathway contains three major genes: pal, c4h and 4cl. two types of correlated structural genes can be distinguished in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway: early biosynthetic genes  and late biosynthetic genes   <cit> . the ebgs, which include chs, chi, f3h, f3’h, and fls, lead to the production of flavonols and other flavonoid compounds, while the lbgs, which include dfr, ans/ldox, and ufgt, lead to the production of anthocyanins  <cit> . the phenylpropanoid pathway genes and ebgs are upstream genes while the lbgs are downstream genes in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. the downstream genes are specifically for anthocyanin biosynthesis  <cit> .

the upstream structural genes have been expanded not only by wgd, but also td. there are  <dig> homologs of the nine a. thaliana phenylpropanoid pathway genes in b. rapa . atc4h has five syntenic orthologs in b. rapa. brc4h <dig> and brc4h <dig>  brc4h <dig> and brc4h <dig> are from two tandem arrays located in mf <dig> and mf <dig>  respectively, while brc4h <dig> is in lf . this shows that brc4hs have expanded by both wgd and td. at4cl <dig> and at4cl <dig> have not expanded by whole genome duplication, but their homologs in b. rapa form two tandem arrays, with one array containing four genes and the other containing two genes .

the biosynthesis of flavonol glycosides and anthocyanins shares common substrates: dihydroflavonols  <cit> . the synthesis of flavonol aglycones has long been attributed to a single enzyme, flavonol synthase , which competes with several other enzymes for dihydroflavonol substrates  <cit> . there are six fls genes in a. thaliana: atfls <dig> to  <dig>  these six genes are all located on chromosome  <dig>  with atfls2- <dig> arranged in a  <dig> -kb tandem array  <cit> . there are also six fls genes in b. rapa: brfls <dig>  brfls <dig>  brfls <dig> , brfls <dig> , brfls <dig> , and brfls <dig> . the tandem array atfls2- <dig> has syntenic loci in all the three subgenomes of b. rapa: brfls <dig> and brfls <dig>  in lf, brlfs <dig>  and brfls <dig>  in mf <dig>  and brfls <dig> in mf <dig> . the tandem array was duplicated by wgd, but only some of the four tandemly duplicated genes have been retained, with two, two, and one in lf, mf <dig> and mf <dig>  respectively . no homologous genes for atfls <dig> were found in b. rapa, neither syntenic nor non-syntenic orthologs. a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the amino acid sequences of the six atfls genes, the six homologs in b. rapa and a fls gene of vitis vinifera to reveal the relationship between these genes . in the phylogenetic tree, atfls <dig> and brfls <dig>  atfls <dig> and brfls <dig>  atfls <dig> and brfls <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , and atfls <dig> and brfls <dig> were clustered together. these results confirmed the hypothesis proposed by owens et al.  that the duplications leading to the amplification of the fls gene family were ancient events  <cit> , from at least before the divergence of b. rapa and a. thaliana.figure  <dig>

dfr, ldox/ans and ufgts are the major lbgs  of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. dfr  catalyzes the first committed reaction to generate anthocyanins. in a. thaliana, the gene atdfr is known to encode a functional dfr  <cit> . dfr was not expanded in b. rapa; only one gene, brdfr, was identified as an ortholog of atdfr. leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase/anthocyanidin synthase  catalyzes the formation of anthocyanidin, the first colored compound in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . two syntenic orthologs in b. rapa, brans <dig> and brans <dig>  were identified by comparative genomic analysis with a. thaliana.

the gene copy number ratios between b. rapa and a. thaliana were  <dig>  ,  <dig>  and  <dig>   for the phenylpropanoid pathway genes, ebgs and lbgs, respectively. in addition to wgt, some phenylpropanoid pathway genes and ebgs  were also expanded by td . these results show that more upstream structural genes were retained than downstream structural genes of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. the redundancy of the upstream genes may guarantee products for successful downstream anthocyanin synthesis.

more negative regulatory genes are retained in the anthocyanin biosynthesis regulatory system of b. rapa
anthocyanin biosynthesis is regulated mostly by the coordinated transcriptional control of the structural genes. the transcriptional control of abg structural genes has been intensively studied  <cit> . in a. thaliana, anthocyanin biosynthetic regulatory genes can be divided into two groups: positive and negative regulatory genes. for positive regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in a. thaliana, the spatial and temporal expression of structural genes is mainly determined by r2r3-myb, basic helix-loop-helix  and wd40-type transcriptional factors and their interaction  <cit> . four r2r3-myb  transcription factors and three bhlh  proteins combine with the wd <dig> repeat protein  to form ternary transcriptional complexes that activate several anthocyanin biosynthetic structural genes, especially in the later steps  of the flavonoid pathway . other r2r3-myb proteins  regulate the structural genes of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway independently, especially the early steps  of the flavonoid pathway  <cit> . two single-repeat r3-myb transcription factors, mybl <dig> and cpc , and three members of the lateral organ boundary domain  gene family, lbd <dig>  lbd <dig>  and lbd <dig>  are negative regulators of anthocyanin biosynthesis in a. thaliana. the regulatory genes in anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway of b. rapa were identified as well as the duplication and retention of these genes were analyzed. detailed information on these biosynthetic regulatory genes in b. rapa is presented below.

myb <dig>  myb <dig>  and myb <dig> activate ebgs of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in a. thaliana <cit> . in b. rapa, there were two syntenic orthologs of atmyb <dig> and three syntenic orthologs of atmyb <dig> , but no homologs of atmyb <dig> were found. these results show that the homolog of atmyb <dig> was lost, while the homologs of atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> were over-retained after the wgt of b. rapa.

atpap <dig>  atpap <dig>  atmyb <dig>  and atmyb <dig>  activate the lbgs by forming ternary complexes with bhlh and wd <dig> proteins. these four genes are all distributed on chromosome  <dig> of a. thaliana. atpap <dig>  atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> are present as a three-gene tandem array. the four atabgs have three orthologs in b. rapa: bra <dig>  bra <dig> and bra <dig>  the high sequence similarity and tandem relationship of these at r2r3-myb genes made it difficult to name the three br genes by synteny or homology analysis. bra <dig> and bra <dig> are two syntenic orthologs of the three-gene tandem array. tandem arrays were not detected in b. rapa, indicating that the tandem duplication may have occurred in a. thaliana after its divergence from b. rapa, or that the redundant tandem arrays were lost through the influence of wgt in b. rapa <cit> . these data suggest that genes encoding r2r3-mybs, which form mbw complexes and regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis, were lost after the wgt in b. rapa compared with those in a. thaliana. bra <dig> is a non-syntenic ortholog of atpap <dig>  atpap <dig>  atmyb <dig>  and atmyb <dig>  but its syntenic gene in a. thaliana is at3g <dig>  which encodes atmyb <dig>  a phylogenetic tree was constructed by aligning the amino acid sequences of atpap <dig>  atpap <dig>  atmyb <dig>  atmtb <dig>  bra <dig>  bra <dig>  bra <dig> and zmp <dig> . in the phylogenetic tree, the four a. thaliana genes and three b. rapa genes are clustered together in one branch, while atmyb <dig> and zmp <dig> form another branch.figure  <dig>

another important group of transcriptional factors is the basic helix-loop-helix  gene family, which regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis through formation of mbw ternary complexes. in a. thaliana, the bhlh transcriptional factors tt <dig> , gl <dig>  and egl <dig>  interact with ttg <dig>  and pap <dig>  pap <dig>  myb <dig>  or myb <dig> to form multiple mbw complexes that then activate lbgs. in b. rapa, there are four brbhlh genes, brtt <dig>  brgl <dig>  bregl <dig>  and bregl <dig> , corresponding to three bhlh genes in a. thaliana. the brbhlh genes in b. rapa seem to have undergone relatively extensive fractionation after wgt.

ttg <dig>  is the only gene that encodes a wd <dig> protein involved in the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in a. thaliana <cit> . in b. rapa, there are two paralogous genes, brttg <dig>  and brttg <dig> , which are syntenic orthologs of atgtt <dig>  the amino acid sequence of brttg <dig>  is shorter than those of brttg <dig>  and atttg <dig>  brttg <dig>  has lost its first wd <dig> repeat domain, n-terminal and c-terminal regions . a previous study showed that the c-terminal region was vital for the structural and function of ttg <dig>  <cit> . a mutant of a. thaliana lacking  <dig> amino acid residues at the c-terminus showed a severe phenotype with no anthocyanins in the testa  <cit> . these results suggest that brttg <dig>  might be non-functional because of large sequence deletions and has become a pseudogene after wgt.figure  <dig>

there are several transcription factors including two r3-type single myb proteins, mybl <dig> and cpc, and three n/no3− induced members of the lbd gene family that act as negative regulators of anthocyanin biosynthesis in a. thaliana. atmybl <dig> is a transcriptional repressor that negatively regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis by interacting with tt <dig> and mbw complexes  <cit> . in b. rapa, there are two syntenic orthologs, brmybl <dig>  and brmybl <dig> , found in lf and mf <dig>  respectively. atcpc, another single repeat r3-myb transcription factor, works as a negative regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis  <cit> . the atcpc gene has two syntenic orthologs in b. rapa, brcpc <dig> and brcpc <dig>  which both share more than 90% amino acid sequence identity with their at ortholog. lbd <dig>  lbd <dig> and lbd <dig> negatively regulate the late anthocyanin-specific steps by repressing pap <dig> and pap <dig> under n/no3− induction  <cit> . there are seven syntenic orthologs of atlbd <dig>  atlbd <dig> and atlbd <dig> in b. rapa .

the regulatory genes have expanded mainly through wgt in b. rapa. in total,  <dig> brabg regulatory genes were identified as homologs of  <dig> atabg regulatory genes. fourteen brabg positive regulatory genes were identified as homologs of  <dig> atabgs, while  <dig> brabg negative regulatory genes were identified as homologs of  <dig> atabgs. the copy numbers of the positive regulatory genes did not show a significant change between b. rapa and a. thaliana, but the number of negative regulatory genes was almost doubled in b. rapa. comparing the copy numbers of the regulatory genes, we found that more negative than positive regulatory genes were retained in the b. rapa genome.

anthocyanins play important roles in responding to abiotic and biotic stresses for plants. b. rapa comprises a variety of vegetables with rich morphological diversity. several varieties accumulate variant kinds and contents of anthocyanins in different tissues, while more varieties of b. rapa present green with no anthocyanins accumulated . so the copy numbers of negative and positive regulatory genes will help us to understand the metabolic characteristics of anthocyanin in b. rapa.

CONCLUSIONS
anthocyanin biosynthetic genes  were identified based on whole-genome comparative analysis between a. thaliana and b. rapa. anthocyanin biosynthetic pathways including  <dig> genes were established in b. rapa. multiple copies of the brabgs were generated by wgd and retained synteny with their orthologs in a. thaliana, but most genes appeared to comprise less than three copies because of gene loss following wgt. more upstream structural genes of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway have been retained than downstream. based on the presence of these homologous structural genes, the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in b. rapa was then established. more negative regulatory genes have been retained than positive by comparing the copy numbers. the composition of brabgs could help us to explain the metabolic profiles of anthocyanin accumulation and elaborate the genetic mechanism of anthocyanin biosynthesis in b. rapa.

there has been little research on anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in b. rapa. here, we identified anthocyanin biosynthetic genes systematically at the whole genome level. the determination of a complete set of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in b. rapa provides a valuable resource for the study of anthocyanin-related traits and genetic improvement of the anthocyanin nutritional quality of b. rapa.
