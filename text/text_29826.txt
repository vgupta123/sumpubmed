BACKGROUND
invasive aspergillosis  has a high case-fatality rate  <cit> , and the prevalence of this fungal infection has increased in parallel with the number of at risk patients  <cit> . ia is an opportunistic infection resulting from inhalation of conidia released by aspergillus fumigatus, the main species responsible for this disease  <cit> . due to their small size , these conidia can reach the alveoli where they are normally phagocytosed and killed by alveolar macrophages through the release of reactive oxidant intermediates  <cit> . intracellular trafficking of a. fumigatus within alveolar macrophages has been described  <cit> . a defect in these alveolar macrophage functions could result in the germination of conidia and subsequent tissue invasion by fungal hyphae.

in contrast to alveolar macrophages, the role of airway epithelial cells in protection against ia has not been studied extensively, despite the fact that these are the first cells of the respiratory tract to encounter inhaled conidia. moreover, the airways epithelium is frequently damaged by chemotherapy, radiation, viral or bacterial infections in immunocompromised patients at risk of ia  <cit> . this damage could trigger invasion from this site. binding and internalization of a. fumigatus conidia by cells which are not professional phagocytes has already been demonstrated in a <dig> lung epithelial cells  <cit>  and endothelial cells  <cit> . rabbit tracheal epithelial cells have also been shown to internalize a. fumigatus conidia but this internalization has not been quantified  <cit> .

in order to study the interaction between a. fumigatus conidia and the respiratory epithelium, an in vitro model of human nasal epithelial cells  at an air-liquid interface has been developed  <cit> . the hnec culture is a primary culture model in which the air-liquid interface results in airway cell differentiation  <cit> . after  <dig> week of culture, hnec are organized into a pseudo-stratified epithelium with mucus and ciliated cells, and flow cytometry analysis of cytokeratin immunofluorescent labeling has demonstrated 99% positive cells, thus excluding the presence of other cell types  <cit> . the surface epithelium of the nose resembles that of the lower airways and hnec are thus representative of the airways epithelium  <cit> . moreover, hnec are also representative of sinonasal epithelium and sinuses are the second anatomical site involved in ia  <cit> .

we used this model to quantify internalization of a. fumigatus conidia by hnec. as a. fumigatus is the main species responsible for ia  <cit> , we wondered whether the rate of internalization of a. fumigatus conidia was different from other mould species and could explain, at least in part, the virulence of this opportunistic fungus. virulence of a. fumigatus is achieved despite the fact that this fungus is usually outnumbered by other species in the environment  <cit> . therefore, as a control we chose to use penicillium chrysogenum, a fungus which is highly prevalent in the environment and which has a similar conidial size  to a. fumigatus. p. chrysogenum is able to grow at 37°c  <cit>  but is rarely involved in invasive disease  <cit> .

RESULTS
to speed up contact between hnec and fungal conidia, the hnec were centrifuged and culture medium containing the conidia was immediately removed from the apical side to restore the air-liquid interface, because immersion rapidly leads to dedifferentiation of hnec. this centrifugation had no effect on the electrophysiological parameters of the hnec. given the limited number of cells recovered from the nasal polyps, the number of available wells differed between primary cultures. therefore, data could not be recorded for all observation times for every batch of hnec.

preliminary studies, using confocal microscopy with z view, suggested that a. fumigatus and p. chrysogenum conidia were internalized after  <dig> h of contact with hnec . this was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy , which showed that a. fumigatus conidia were internalized into vacuoles . staining of lysosomal lamp <dig> membrane protein revealed the mature phagosomes of the conidia-containing vacuoles. lysosomal lamp <dig> membrane protein is acquired by late endosomes during their maturation to lysosomes  <cit> . a positive immunofluorescence signal was detected around ingested a. fumigatus and p. chrysogenum conidia as early as  <dig> h after infection . the mouse igg <dig> isotype control antibody did not label any vacuole-like structures. these findings provide evidence of late endosomal-phagolysosomal trafficking of internalized a. fumigatus conidia.

confocal microscopy and tem did not allow us to quantify the number of bound and phagocytosed conidia since hnec do not form a monolayer and the cells are tightly bound together. as a consequence, the number of individual epithelial cells in contact with the conidia cannot be counted. therefore, we dissociated the hnec after contact with unlabeled conidia. among  <dig> randomly selected hnec, observed in two independent experiments, and 20%  and 18%  were associated with at least one conidium after  <dig> h interaction between hnec and conidia, with between  <dig> and  <dig> conidia per cell  and  <dig> and  <dig> conidia per cell  for a. fumigatus and p. chrysogenum, respectively . the differences between the two fungi were not statistically significant.

however, these experiments did not distinguish between bound and phagocytosed conidia. to quantify phagocytosis of a. fumigatus by hnec, two different experiments were performed. the first involved fitc-labeled conidia and anti-a. fumigatus conidia antiserum . the proportion of a. fumigatus conidia phagocytosed by hnec was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % after  <dig> h of contact in three different primary cultures . as no anti-p. chrysogenum conidia antiserum was available, this experiment was not performed with this fungus.

internalization was revealed by double immunostaining. percentages and means were calculated from the bound conidia figures for two wells of three different primary cultures.

the second experiment to quantify phagocytosed conidia used the fluorescent brightener, blankophor-p-fluessig® ] amino stilbene- <dig> '-disulfonic acid), which is a similar fluorescent diaminostilbene compound to calcofluor white and uvitex 2b  <cit> . quantification of phagocytosis with seven different hnec cultures is shown in table  <dig>  the proportion of conidia taken up varied between 9% and 33% for a. fumigatus  according to the primary culture used. a similar or non-significant increase in phagocytosis rate was observed with longer observation times up to  <dig> h . after  <dig> h, observation was hampered by the growth of hyphae from non-internalized conidia. we investigated the internalization of a. fumigatus and p. chrysogenum conidia in parallel in two primary cultures . no statistically significant difference  was observed between the two species for a given culture, irrespective of the observation time.

percentages and standard deviations were calculated from the bound conidia figures for two wells at each time point with seven and two different primary cultures for a. fumigatus and p. chrysogenum respectively.

during our experiments, we were unable to detect any germinated conidia inside hnec until  <dig> h post-infection. in addition, we also failed to detect any modifications to the electrophysiological parameters of the hnec. this indicates that hnec inhibited germination of phagocytosed conidia and had a fungistatic or fungicidal effect. to study the rate of killing of phagocytosed conidia, we used a combination of propidium iodide  and blankophor staining. the results are summarized in table  <dig>  the killing rate for a. fumigatus conidia varied from 9–24%  after  <dig> h according to the hnec culture. with longer incubation times the killing rate usually increased, without exceeding 35%. the killing rate of p. chrysogenum conidia was lower than with a. fumigatus conidia for a given hnec .

percentages and standard deviations were calculated from the bound conidia figures for two wells at each time point with four and two different primary cultures for a. fumigatus and p. chrysogenum respectiveley.

discussion
using an original in vitro model of hnec at an air-liquid interface, we showed that hnec are able to phagocytose a. fumigatus conidia. labeling of lysosomal lamp <dig> membrane protein confirmed that internalized conidia were trafficked into a late endosomal-lysosomal compartment. phagocytosis of a. fumigatus conidia by alveolar macrophages is close to 100%  <cit> , but is much lower for non-professional phagocytes such as the a <dig> cell line and human umbilical vein endothelial cells for which phagocytosis rates of 30% and 50%, respectively, have been reported  <cit> . in the present study, the rate of conidia phagocytosed by hnec was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at  <dig> h post-infection using double immunolabeling. using combined staining with a fluorescence brightener, the mean rate of conidia phagocytosed was  <dig>  ±  <dig> %. the differences observed between different primary hnec cultures and these two different methods might be due to difficulties in standardizing the inoculum, contact between conidia and hnec, the number of cells in each well, and the ratio between the different cell types. indeed, in some instances high standard deviations were observed, calculated from the means of three wells. however, irrespective of the hnec culture the phagocytosis rate increased slightly between  <dig> and  <dig> h, and remained stable until  <dig> h for a given culture. another explanation for the differences observed between hnec could be the genetic background of the patients, since these hnec are primary cultures. indeed, the phagocytosis rate may depend on some intrinsic cellular properties. this may explain the lack of reproducibility of the experiments. on the other hand, it may also explain why some patients develop invasive disease and others do not, as suggested by studies on innate immunity in ia  <cit> .

using a fluorescence brightener and pi uptake  <cit> , we confirmed that > 75% and > 50% of the conidia were viable after  <dig> h and  <dig> h of contact, respectively. although hnec were unable to kill most phagocytosed conidia, germination of the conidia inside the hnec was inhibited for at least  <dig> h after phagocytosis. in cell-free media, swelling and germination of a. fumigatus conidia occurs after as little as 6– <dig> h of culture at 35°c  <cit> , as observed with the reference strain used . this suggests that hnec inhibited germination of phagocytosed conidia and had a fungistatic effect. at longer incubation times, observation was hampered by hyphae from non-phagocytosed conidia growing over the hnec. therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that germination of phagocytosed conidia occurs after  <dig> h inside the cells or outside the cells after phagocytosis. similar observations have been reported with a <dig> cells. whereas none of the phagocytosed conidia germinated after  <dig> h  <cit> , 34% germinate after  <dig> h  <cit> . additional experiments are needed to clarify the fungistatic effect of hnec lysosomes and the ability of fungal conidia to survive in phagolysosomes.

comparison of our results with a. fumigatus conidia and those with p. chrysogenum suggest that phagocytosis of the two species does not differ significantly for a given primary culture. hnec are known to internalize bacteria  <cit>  and inert particles  <cit> . we have thus extended this observation to fungal conidia. we did not observe better adhesion of a. fumigatus conidia to hnec compared to p. chrysogenum conidia. however, a slight difference was observed in the killing rates. killing of p. chrysogenum conidia was lower for a given hnec. this might be explained by the slower growth rate of p. chrysogenum at 37°c compared to a. fumigatus if the cells only have anti-conidial activity against germinating elements. therefore, the higher prevalence of a. fumigatus as a cause of ia compared to other aspergillus species is probably not explained by better adhesion of conidia to the cells or a higher rate of phagocytosis. nevertheless, other factors such as complement  <cit>  could affect the conidia in vivo and modify phagocytosis and killing rates differently according to the fungal species.

CONCLUSIONS
using for the first time hnec to study interactions between conidia from different species and respiratory epithelial cells, our data provide evidence that respiratory epithelial cells can phagocytose a. fumigatus and p. chrysogenum conidia. the phagocytosis rate did not differ between a. fumigatus and p. chrysogenum for a given primary culture. moreover, the cells do not rapidly kill these conidia and uptake of conidia into nasal epithelial cells in primary culture was not accompanied by apparent cell destruction. thus, phagocytosed conidia may serve as a reservoir for dissemination throughout the host. the differences in uptake of a. fumigatus conidia observed between different primary cultures may arise from a difference in individual host cell response to conidial exposure.
