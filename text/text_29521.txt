BACKGROUND
recently, it has been shown that heat stress causes thermoregulatory deficits in unrestrained, unanesthetized mice  <cit> . heat stressed mice become hypothermic when exposed to room temperature. the heat stress-induced hypothermia in mice may result from ischemic damage to their hypothalamus .

it has also been reported that healthy volunteers display higher serum levels of heat shock protein   <dig> than those of heatstroke patient  <cit> . increased serum levels of hsp <dig> appears to correlate with heat tolerance. this hypothesis is further supported by experimental studies. for example, sublethal heat shock pretreatment  <dig> h before initiation of heatstroke, in addition to increasing hsp <dig> in multiple organs, conferred significant protection against heatstroke-induced circulatory shock and cerebral ischemia and oxidative damage  <cit>  in anesthetized rats. both l-arginine  <cit>  and glutamine  <cit>  have also been shown to increase the expression of hsp <dig> in multiorgans and reduce mortality in a rat model of heatstroke. however, it is not known whether the heat-induced hypothalamic ischemia and oxidative damage, thermoregulatory dysfunction and mortality can be affected by hsp <dig> overexpression in transgenic mice.

to deal with the question, in this research with the transgenic mice, we first conducted several biochemical, physiological, and histological determination and then investigated the beneficial effects of hsp <dig> overexpression on the identified hypothalamic deficits, thermoregulatory dysfunction, and mortality during heatstroke  <cit> .

RESULTS
hsp <dig> overexpression in the hypothalamus of hsp <dig> mice
the o.d. values of protein assay by the densitometer for hypothalamic tissues obtained from different groups are summarized in figure  <dig>  the animals were killed  <dig> h post whole body heating  for heated groups or the equivalent time period for non-heated groups. western analyses revealed that both heated and non-heated hsp <dig> mice had higher hypothalamic expression of hsp <dig> than those of both heated and non-heated hsp <dig> mice .

hsp <dig> overexpression attenuates heat-induced lethality and hypothermia
as summarized in figure  <dig>  as compared to non-heated hsp <dig> mice, the percent survival values of heated hsp <dig> mice were significantly lower when evaluated at both  <dig> h and  <dig> h post wbh . the heat-induced lethality was completely abolished by overexpression of hsp <dig> in the hypothalamus of hsp <dig> mice . four hours after heat stress, the core temperature values of heated hsp <dig> mice were significantly lower than those of non-heated hsp <dig> mice kept at a normal ambient temperature  . again, the heat-induced hypothermia was completely abolished by overexpression of hsp <dig> in the hypothalamus .

discussion
it has been shown that severe heat exposure causes profound thermoregulatory dysfunction  and mortality  <cit> . our data further demonstrated that the heat-induced thermoregulatory dysfunction and mortality may be resulted from ischemia and oxidative damage to their hypothalamus  in the mouse. the latate-to-pyruvate ratio is a well-known marker of cellular ischemia, whereas glycerol is a marker of how severly cells are affected by ongoing pathology  <cit> . compared to normothermic control, heatstroke mice had significantly higher levels of cellular ischemia  and damage  markers in their hypothalamus  <cit> . these heatstroke mice also displayed significantly higher hypothalamic levels of reactive oxygen species , lipid peroxidation , and enzymatic pro-oxidants , but lower hypothalamic levels of enzymatic anti-oxidant defences  during heatstroke. increased production of reactive oxygen species has been reported to be directly involved in oxidative damage with cellular macromolecules in ischemic brain tissues, which lead to cell death  <cit> . probably, the most striking finding of the present study is that overexpression of hsp <dig> in the hypothalamus significantly protects against the heat-induced hypothalamic ischemia and oxidative damage, thermoregulatory dysfunction, and mortality. the present results are in part consistent with several previous experiments. for example, l-arginine administration to heat-stressed mice  <cit>  or glutamine administration to heat-stressed rats  <cit>  increases the expression of hsp <dig> and contributes to the protective effect of these drugs in rodents subjected to heatstroke. sublethal heat shock pretreatment  <dig> h before initiation of heatstroke, in addition to increasing brain hsp <dig> levels, conferred significant protection against heatstroke-induced brain oxidative damage in anesthetized rats  <cit> .

in the rodents, environmental heat stress increases cutaneous blood flow and metabolism and progressively decreases splanchnic blood flow. reduced splanchnic ischemia coupled with increased metabolism causes hyperthermia and cellular ischemia and hypoxia in peripheral organs  <cit> . after the onset of heatstroke, loss of blood flow to the brain  results in neuronal injury due to both the cessation of blood flow leading to oxygen and nutrient deprivation and the initiation of a cascade of secondary mechanism  <cit> . indeed, it has been shown that nitric oxide levels in multiple organs are elevated in heatstroke rats  <cit> . heat-induced multiple organ dysfunction can be greatly reduced by inducible and neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitors. in the present study, when exposed the unanesthetized and unrestrained mice to high ambient temperatures, overproduction of nitric oxide in their hypothalami was noted after the onset of heatstroke. heat-induced overproduction of nitric oxide in the hypothalamus was greatly reduced by hypothalamic hsp <dig> overexpression in hsp mice. it should be stressed that, in the present study, we measured only the hypothalamic levels of nitric oxide. it is reasonable to assume that the similar outcome can be seen in other organs. therefore, based on these findings, we propose that overexpression of hsp <dig> in multiple organs may attenuate heatstroke reactions by reducing heat-induced overproduction of nitric oxide.

in anesthetized rats, overproduction of both il- <dig> and tnf-α in both the peripheral blood stream and the brain occurred during heatstroke  <cit> . the same phenomenon was also observed in unanesthetized, unrestrained mice attendanted with heatstroke, as shown in the present results. overexpression of hsp <dig> in hsp <dig> mice before the initiation of heat stress significantly prevented the heat-induced overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines in brain, hypotension, and animal death. in particular, overproduction of il- <dig> in brain was evoked in heated hsp <dig> mice. this implies that hsp <dig> overexpression may improve heat tolerance by increasing il- <dig> but decreasing tnf-α and il-1β production in multiple organs. the contention is supported by many investigators. for example, il- <dig> knockout mice have an increased extent of inflammation illness  <cit>  and higher mortality rates after experimental sepsis  <cit> . exogenous administration of recombinant il- <dig> protects mice from lethal endotoxemia by reducing tnf-α release  <cit> . in endotoxemic mice, neutralization of endogenously produced il- <dig> results in an increased production of proinflammatory cytokines and enhanced mortality  <cit> .

at the cellular level, failing energy metabolism and atp depletion are the earliest cell-damaging factors of ischemic insult. in vivo, severe depletion of atp causes proteotoxic stress that leads to dysfunction, destabilization and aggregation of many proteins  <cit> . the present results further found that prior hsp <dig> overexpression in hsp <dig> mice significantly shields against heat-induced reactions by maintaining appropriate levels of atp in hypothalamic tissues.

our previous outcomes  <cit>  have identified that, in anesthetized mice, hsp <dig> overexpression in multiple organs preserves against hypotension and striatal ischemic injury during heatstroke. in the current findings, the hypothalamic hsp <dig> overexpression protects unanesthetized, unrestrained mice from heatstroke-induced death, thermoregulatory deficits , and hypothalamic ischemia, inflammation, oxidative damage, and neuronal damage, and, therefore, hypothalamic hsp <dig> overexpression appears to be critical to the development of thermotolerance and protection from heat-induced multiple organ dysfunction or failure.

when the mice were exposed to heat stress at  <dig> °c for  <dig> min, fos-positive neurons increased in the hypothalamic areas, which were thought to be involved in thermoregulation, fluid regulation, and neuroendocrine effector systems  <cit> . food consumption and body weight gains decreased after a daily  <dig> min exposure to  <dig> °c for  <dig> weeks  <cit> . the corticosterone and vasopressin levels in the blood, and catecholamine and serotonin metabolite levels in the hypothalamus augmented when above 37°c for  <dig> min. especially, exposure to  <dig> °c 85% rh for  <dig> min caused low corticosterone levels  <cit> , which were believed to be affected in heat-induced animal death.

to our knowledge, no relevant data differentiate behavioral biochemical differences between the heat stress  and hsp <dig> groups. for example, did the hsp <dig> animals exhibit a longer recovery time after heat stress so that they stayed unconscious at the time when the body temperature was measured  <dig> hours after the heat stress treatment terminated? did either group display different patterns of drinking or eating after heat stress? did the groups demonstrate differences in body weight regulation? prospectively, it would be very interesting for investigating these mice in metabolic chambers.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, when exposed the mice that contain a transgene for the porcine heat shock protein  <dig> gene to heat stress, the transgenic mice exhibited extraordinary responses, including the ability to survive the stress. a large number of indicators demonstrate that neural samples of the hypothalamus from the surviving mice showed better adaptation. the group suggests that injury of neural tissue of the hypothalamus is related to the inability of normal mice to withstand heat stress, and that the overexpression of the hsp <dig> transgene reduced hypothalamic damage from the stress, permitting the transgenic animal better adaptation.
