BACKGROUND
soon after entry into the cells of certain mammalian species, some retroviruses encounter blocks mediated by the restriction factor trim5α. for example, human immunodeficiency virus , the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome , can infect human and chimpanzee cells, but is blocked in cells of old world monkeys  <cit> . in contrast, simian immunodeficiency virus  infects old world monkey cells but is restricted in the cells of most new world monkeys  <cit> . trim5α, a member of the tripartite motif  family of proteins, mediates these early infection blocks  <cit> . differences in trim5α proteins among species account for the distinct patterns of retroviral restriction observed in mammalian lineages  <cit> . trim5α has been shown to bind and promote the premature uncoating of incoming retroviral capsids  <cit> .

like all trim proteins, trim5α contains ring, b-box  <dig> and coiled coil domains  <cit> . the α isoform of trim <dig>  which is the only trim <dig> isoform that exhibits antiretroviral activity  <cit> , also has a carboxy-terminal b <dig>  domain  <cit> . mutagenic studies have shed light on the contribution of the trim5α domains to antiretroviral activity. the ring domain, which exhibits e <dig> ubiquitin ligase activity, contributes to anti-hiv- <dig> potency, but is not absolutely required for a modest level of restriction ability  <cit> . the b-box  <dig> domain is essential for higher-order associations among trim5α dimers and contributes to the cooperative binding of trim5α to the retroviral capsid  <cit> . the coiled coil and adjacent linker  region are sufficient for dimerization of trim5α, which results in a higher avidity of trim5α-capsid binding  <cit> . the direct contact between trim5α and the retroviral capsid is thought to be mediated by the b <dig>  domain. surface-exposed loops within the trim5α b <dig>  domain exhibit pronounced variability and have been subject to positive selection during mammalian evolution  <cit> . amino acid changes in these b <dig>  variable loops or in the viral capsid protein can alter capsid recognition and the specificity of retrovirus restriction  <cit> .

structural information on trim proteins is still limited. there are no published structures of a complete trim protein, even though some trim proteins  protein), trim <dig> , trim <dig> , trim <dig> ) and trim <dig> ) have been studied extensively due to their association with human diseases  <cit> . poor expression levels and tendencies to aggregate into nuclear or cytoplasmic bodies have hampered efforts to obtain complete trim protein structures  <cit> . nonetheless, structures of individual trim domains have been solved. the ring and b-box  <dig> structures of trim <dig> and other trim proteins have been solved by nmr  <cit> . structures of the b <dig>  domains of trim <dig> as well as of several proteins not in the trim family have been obtained by x-ray crystallography  <cit> . no structural information on the coiled-coil domain of any trim protein is available. such information would be very valuable, as the coiled coil presumably resides near the dimeric axis and provides a central scaffold for the positioning of the other trim domains. the trim coiled coil is predicted to be alpha helical  <cit> , but lacks easily identifiable heptad repeat motifs that characterize some of the classical coiled coils for which structural information is available.

recently, we have devised approaches that allow expression of sufficient quantities of trim5α variants in baculovirus-infected cells for purification and biochemical characterization  <cit> . substitution of the trim <dig> ring domain for that of rhesus monkey trim5α resulted in a protein  that was efficiently expressed and was purified. trim5-21r is a dimer and binds hiv- <dig> capsid-nucleocapsid  complexes assembled in vitro <cit> . binding of trim5-21r to hiv- <dig> ca-nc complexes depends upon the b <dig>  domain v <dig> variable region. protease-resistant fragments of trim5-21r were characterized  <cit> . here we describe the expression in e. coli, purification and characterization of one such fragment containing the b-box, coiled coil and linker  <dig>  region of rhesus monkey trim5α.

methods
plasmid construction and production of recombinant bccl <dig> protein
the recombinant bacterial construct expressing bccl <dig> was prepared using the champion pet gateway vector with a kanamycin cassette. gateway recombination resulted in a gene that encodes an n-terminal hexa-histidine tag, a spacer, and the bccl <dig> protein. the predicted n-terminus of the resulting bccl <dig> protein is hhhhhhgsglvprgsasmsdsevnqeakpevklspeegqk.... the recombinant vector was transformed into bl21plyss competent cells . five single colonies were picked and examined for expression. the colony exhibiting the highest level of bccl <dig> expression was incubated in luria broth  at 37°c till the od reached  <dig> , at which time isopropyl-thiogalactoside  was added to a final concentration of  <dig> mm; incubation was continued overnight at 18°c. the cdnas expressing the wild-type bccl <dig> protein and b-box  <dig> mutants were cloned into pcdna/v5-gw/d-topo  for expression in mammalian cells.

expression and purification of the bccl <dig> proteins
single bacterial colonies were expanded and induced as described above. the cells were harvested by centrifugation at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> minutes, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended at  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/ml in bacterial protein extraction reagent   in the presence of  <dig> mm dithiothreitol  and a cocktail of protease inhibitors comprising  <dig> mm -methanesulfonyl fluoride ,  <dig> mm e- <dig>   <dig> mm leupeptin, and  <dig> mm pepstatin a . a sample was taken for analysis, and then the cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> minutes. the resulting cell supernatant was mixed with ni+2-nitrilotriacetic acid  superflow resin  according to the manufacturer's protocol. protein was eluted from the resin with  <dig> mm imidazole. the eluted protein fraction was concentrated and was loaded on a superdex  <dig> hr 10/ <dig> size-exclusion chromatography  column . the column was equilibrated against pbs. preparative sec was run at  <dig>  ml/min at 4°c. a calibration curve for molecular size estimation was generated by loading gel-filtration markers  comprising thyroglobulin , bovine gamma-globulin , chicken ovalbumin , equine myoglobin  and vitamin b <dig>  proteins onto this sec column and eluting under similar conditions. the resulting fractions were analyzed by sds-page and those containing the bccl <dig> protein were pooled and concentrated. for further purification, buffer was exchanged into  <dig> mm tris-hcl/ <dig> mm nacl, ph  <dig> by using a pd- <dig> column . anion-exchange chromatography was subsequently performed on a 5-ml q-sepharose hi-trap column  equilibrated with  <dig> mm tris-hcl/ <dig> mm nacl, ph  <dig> . bound proteins were eluted by using a nacl gradient . the bccl <dig> protein was eluted with  <dig> mm nacl, and fractions containing the protein were pooled, dialyzed and concentrated by ultrafiltration with centricon- <dig> devices . the cocktail of protease inhibitors  was added to the samples throughout each stage of the purification scheme. the bccl <dig> protein was at least 95% pure, as determined by a coomassie-stained gel.

elicitation of polyclonal antibodies in rabbits

western blotting
aliquots were collected at each step of bccl <dig> purification and the associated proteins were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . the proteins were transferred to poly  immobilon filters  by a semidry blotting apparatus. polyclonal rabbit antibody directed against the purified bccl <dig> protein was used as the primary antibody to detect the bccl <dig> protein in western blot experiments. horseradish peroxidase -conjugated goat anti-rabbit igg was used as the secondary antibody. the western blot was developed with the ecl chemiluminescence detection system  and the kodak film processor system .

analytical size-exclusion chromatography
a sample of the ni+2-affinity-purified bccl <dig> protein was fractionated by size exclusion on a superdex  <dig>  column calibrated with molecular-weight markers. the column was equilibrated in pbs at a flow rate of  <dig>  ml/min, and the absorbance of the eluted protein was recorded at  <dig> nm. the column was mounted on a high-performance liquid chromatography system . fractions were collected every minute, and a sample from each fraction was analyzed by sds-page.

size-exclusion chromatography-light scattering 
the molecular masses of full-length proteins were determined by ewa folta-stogniew using sec-ls in the hhmi biopolymer facility and w. m. keck foundation biotechnology resource laboratory at yale university. briefly, a sample containing approximately  <dig> μg of ller protein was filtered through a  <dig> -μm durapore membrane  and applied to a superose  <dig> hr 10/ <dig> column coupled with an in-line dawn eos laser light-scattering apparatus , refractometer , and uv detector . the average molecular mass of the elution peak was calculated using astra software.

mass spectrometry
matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight  mass spectrometry of the ller protein was performed at the molecular biology core facility at dana-farber cancer institute , using a sinapinic acid matrix.

dynamic light scattering
measurements were carried out using a temperature-controlled zetasizer nano-s  at 20°c. a protein solution  was filtered through a  <dig> -μm membrane into a 20°c pre-warmed light-scattering cuvette and measurements were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions.

crosslinking of the purified bccl <dig> protein
the purified ller protein  was incubated with various concentrations  of glutaraldehyde  at room temperature for  <dig> minutes, after which  <dig>  m tris-hcl, ph  <dig>  was added to quench the reaction. the crosslinked proteins were boiled in sds-denaturing buffer and subjected to sds-page  and coomassie blue staining.

transiently transfected  <dig> t cells expressing wild-type rhesus monkey bccl <dig> and the corresponding b-box  <dig> mutants were washed in phosphate-buffered saline  and lysed in np <dig> lysis buffer , 1× protease inhibitor  in pbs) for  <dig> minutes at 4°c. lysates were centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> minutes at 4°c. lysates were crosslinked with varying concentrations  of glutaraldehyde for  <dig> minutes at room temperature and centrifuged briefly in a table-top centrifuge. the reaction mix was quenched with  <dig>  m tris-hcl, ph  <dig> , briefly centrifuged and analyzed by western blotting as described above.

native gel electrophoresis
electrophoresis was performed using the novex polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system . protein samples were mixed with native gel running buffer , 20% glycerol, and  <dig> % bromophenol blue) to a final concentration of  <dig>  mg/ml. thirty microliters of each sample was loaded onto a 4-16% gradient polyacrylamide gel and run at  <dig> v in tris-glycine buffer . after the dye front migrated to the bottom of the gel, the gel was developed using coomassie blue staining. the unstained nativemark protein standard  was used for markers.

electron microscopy
for negative staining, the purified ller protein was directly applied to carbon-coated grids after glow discharge. these were negatively stained with 1%  uranyl formate and observed in a tecnai g <dig> spirit biotwin  electron microscope operated at  <dig> kv. micrographs were recorded at a magnification of  <dig>  x and pictures taken under low-dose conditions.

for cryo-electron microscopic analysis,  <dig> μl of the protein solution was applied to a quantifoil grid, blotted by filter paper for  <dig> seconds and immediately plunged into liquid ethane; the whole process was performed with an fei vitrobot. the prepared cryo-grids then were subjected to imaging in a tecnai f <dig> field-emission gun electron microscope equipped with a gatan ct <dig> cryo-transfer holder that was cooled down to -180°c by liquid nitrogen. micrographs were recorded in bright-field mode at a magnification of  <dig>  × and at a defocus of ~3- <dig> μm by a  <dig> k ×  <dig> k gatan ccd camera, with a total dose no greater than  <dig> electrons per nm <dig> 

circular dichroism  spectroscopy
samples for circular dichroism  spectroscopy were buffer-exchanged into pbs. the cd spectrum was measured with an aviv  <dig> cd spectrometer , using a quartz cuvette with a path length of  <dig>  cm. measurements were obtained in  <dig> -nm intervals from  <dig> to  <dig> nm, a 1-nm bandwidth, and a  <dig> -s measurement time at each wavelength. instrument units were converted to mean residue molar ellipticity according to the formula: θ = millidegree/molar concentration/number of amino acids. the percentage of secondary structure was calculated using the following formula: % helicity =  <dig> × θ222/θ <dig>  where θ <dig> = - <dig>  × .

RESULTS
expression and purification of a core fragment of trim5αrh
trim5-21r is a chimeric protein containing the ring domain of trim <dig> and the b-box  <dig>  coiled coil, linker  <dig> and b <dig>  domain of trim5αrh  <cit> . trim5-21r, like many trim proteins  <cit> , is prone to aggregation at high concentrations. to identify constructs that might be better behaved, we characterized trim5-21r fragments that were relatively resistant to trypsin and chymotrypsin digestion  <cit> . proteins corresponding to these protease-resistant fragments were expressed in e. coli. among the several constructs tested, the bccl <dig> protein was soluble and able to be purified in adequate amounts following affinity purification . the bccl <dig> protein consists of an n-terminal his <dig> tag and a vector-derived spacer fused to the b-box  <dig> domain, the coiled-coil domain and the linker  <dig>  region of trim5αrh ; the predicted molecular weight of the bccl <dig> protein is  <dig>  kd. although the bccl <dig> protein lacks a b <dig>  domain, which is needed for hiv- <dig> capsid binding and virus restriction  <cit> , it retains the other trim5α domains required for inhibition of hiv- <dig> infection. the bccl <dig> protein with an n-terminal his <dig> tag was expressed in the bl <dig> strain of e. coli under the control of the t <dig> promoter. different temperatures, times/duration of induction, and iptg concentrations were studied to identify conditions under which bccl <dig> protein expression was maximal, while maintaining adequate solubility. optimal conditions involved treatment with  <dig> mm iptg at an optical density of the culture of  <dig>  and an overnight induction at 18°c. although a significant portion  of the bccl <dig> protein remained in the insoluble pellet, soluble bccl <dig> protein  was obtained and was affinity purified using ni-nta beads and elution with  <dig> mm imidazole .

athe rhesus monkey trim5α variants are designated according to the domains included in the protein: r = ring domain; b = b-box  <dig> domain; cc = coiled-coil domain; l <dig> = linker  <dig> region. all of the trim5α constructs were expressed in bl21plyss e. coli using the champion pet gateway vector, which adds an n-terminal hexa-histidine tag and a spacer. the inserted fragment of the rbccl <dig> protein corresponds to the trim5αrh sequences 1masgill...mefrltda <dig>  the inserted fragment of the ring-bccl <dig> protein corresponds to the trim5αrh sequences 15cpicle...mefrltda <dig> 

bthe amount of protein found in the soluble and insoluble  fractions is indicated, with increased levels designated by increasing numbers of plus signs.

the affinity-purified bccl <dig> protein was analyzed by gel-filtration chromatography . the bccl <dig> protein migrated in overlapping broad peaks at positions corresponding to molecular weights of approximately  <dig> -  <dig> kd. the bccl <dig> protein was further purified by anion-exchange chromatography, where it eluted in a single peak . the purified protein fractions  were pooled, concentrated and stored at 4°c  or at -20°c at concentrations less than  <dig>  mg/ml .

effects of b-box  <dig> changes on bccl <dig> expression and oligomerization
the self-association of trim5α dimers in higher-order complexes is dependent upon specific charged and hydrophobic residues on the surface of the b-box  <dig> domain  <cit> . to investigate whether trim5α self-association might contribute to the behavior of the bccl <dig> protein, we altered b-box  <dig> residues previously shown to contribute to higher-order association  <cit>  . several-fold increases in the amount of the bccl <dig> protein that could be solubilized resulted from the changes in the b-box  <dig> domain . the expression level of soluble b-box mutant proteins such as ller was approximately 1- <dig> mg/liter of e.coli. the b-box  <dig> mutants  with multiple surface changes eluted as two major peaks on a gel-filtration column, in contrast to the broad peak observed for the wild-type bccl <dig> protein . the ller protein demonstrated the clearest separation into two peaks of approximately  <dig> and  <dig> kd.

effect of zinc on ller expression and oligomerization
because the b-box  <dig> domain of the bccl <dig> protein binds two zinc ions  <cit> , we investigated the effect of zinc supplementation and dtt treatment on the expression and oligomerization of the ller variant. no augmentation of ller expression resulted from supplementation of growth medium with 25- <dig> mm zncl2; in fact, ller expression was diminished at the highest zncl <dig> concentration tested . the addition of zncl <dig> or dtt did not significantly affect the elution profile of the ller protein on gel-filtration chromatography .

dynamic light scattering analysis of the oligomeric state of the ller protein
the oligomeric state of the ller protein, purified by nickel-affinity and anion-exchange chromatography, was investigated by size-exclusion chromatography-light scattering . sec-ls can estimate molecular mass independently of the stokes radius of the protein and without reference to a curve based on protein standards. molecular mass determination by sec-ls depends only upon the light-scattering and refractive indices, which are measured by detectors situated downstream of the size-exclusion column. the ller protein eluted in two peaks, the first ranging from 140- <dig> kd, the second from 57- <dig> kd . a size analysis by astra  calculated a hydrodynamic radius of approximately  <dig>  nm. the molecular weight of the protein in peak  <dig> is consistent with that expected for a dimer, whereas the protein in peak  <dig> apparently represents a higher-order oligomer.

we conducted additional dynamic light-scattering analysis of the two purified ller protein fractions from size-exclusion chromatography . the protein in peak  <dig> exhibited a diameter of  <dig>  nm and a polydispersity of 22%, and the protein in peak  <dig> exhibited a diameter of  <dig>  nm and a polydispersity of 45%.

crosslinking analysis of the ller protein
the oligomeric state of the ller protein was examined by chemical crosslinking with glutaraldehyde, followed by analysis on an sds-polyacrylamide gel. the major crosslinked form of the protein migrated around  <dig> kd, suggestive of a dimer . smaller quantities of higher-order, approximately 150-kd forms were observed after crosslinking.

next, the ller protein from gel-filtration fractions  were crosslinked with glutaraldehyde and analyzed. the ller protein in peak  <dig> mainly crosslinked into dimers. by contrast, the protein in peak  <dig> formed fewer dimers and crosslinked primarily into higher-molecular-weight species .

because crosslinked trim <dig> protein can migrate aberrantly on sds-polyacrylamide gels  <cit> , the ller protein crosslinked with glutaraldehyde was analyzed by mass spectrometry. most of the untreated ller protein exhibited a mass consistent with a monomer , with a small amount of dimer  . the ller protein crosslinked with glutaraldehyde demonstrated approximately equivalent amounts of monomer  and dimer  . these results support the conclusion that the ller protein is mainly dimeric, with some higher-order forms. approximately half of the ller protein migrated on native gels at a size consistent with a dimer, with most of the remainder of the protein migrating as a monomer; a small fraction of the protein migrated as a higher-order oligomer .

the oligomeric state of the wild-type bccl <dig> protein was compared with that of the b-box  <dig> mutants. for this purposes, the proteins were expressed transiently in  <dig> ft human kidney cells. compared with the wild-type bccl <dig> protein, the b-box  <dig> mutants were expressed comparably  and exhibited a similar pattern upon crosslinking . thus, all of the b-box  <dig> mutants retain the ability to dimerize.

circular dichroism  spectrometry
the cd spectrum of the ller protein was determined at different temperatures . the spectrum is characterized by a large negative change of ellipticity at  <dig> nm and is typical of that expected for a structured, predominantly alpha-helical, protein  <cit> . a quantitative analysis of the spectra obtained at different temperatures suggested that an extended alpha-helical conformation exists over a wide range of temperatures. the stability of the protein was examined by monitoring the effect of temperature on the far uv cd spectrum at  <dig> nm . the ller protein exhibited a biphasic loss of alpha-helical content, with one transition at 42°c and another near 80°c. the 42°c transition occurs concomitantly with a dramatic decrease in the dimerization of the protein, as judged by crosslinking analysis .

protease resistance of the bccl <dig> protein
the protease resistance of the ller protein was compared with that of the trim5α-21r protein by incubating the proteins with trypsin. at incubation times where the trim5α-21r was substantially degraded to smaller fragments by trypsin, the ller protein was retained in significant amounts . a major portion of the ller protein is resistant to digestion, suggesting that these fractions are either compactly folded or represent higher-order oligomers that are resistant to trypsin digestion.

electron microscopy of the ller protein
the purified ller protein was examined by negative staining under a transmission electron microscope. most of the shapes on the grid were round or ovoid, although occasional filaments were observed . single-particle imaging by cryoelectron microscopy was performed on the peak  <dig> and peak  <dig> gel-filtration fractions of the ller protein. the ller proteins from peak  <dig> formed c-shaped structures roughly 120- <dig> Å wide, with an appendage asymmetrically placed to one side of the arc . the ller proteins in peak  <dig> consisted of spherical structures approximately 105- <dig> Å in diameter . the addition of antibodies directed against the n-terminal his <dig> tag allowed visualization of complexes of the ller protein with one antibody molecule  or with two antibody molecules . these results indicate that these structures represented ller multimers that were at least dimeric.

discussion
previous studies of the trim5α-21r protein suggested that trim5α preferentially forms dimers  <cit> . one of the major protease-resistant fragments of trim5α-21r consisted of the b-box  <dig> and coiled-coil domains, as well as the adjacent linker  <dig>  region  <cit> . here, we produced this protease-resistant fragment  of rhesus monkey trim5α and verified that it is relatively resistant to trypsin digestion compared with the trim5α-21r protein. protease resistance often is associated with the absence of conformationally flexible surface loops on a protein and thus might indicate a propensity to crystallize  <cit> . although the polydispersity of the purified bccl <dig> protein is high, an unfavorable predictor of crystallizability  <cit> , additional modifications of the protein, optimization of solvent conditions or the inclusion of appropriate ligands may facilitate crystallization.

our results demonstrate that, in the absence of other eukaryotic proteins, the bccl <dig> protein forms dimers. thus, the b-box  <dig> and coiled-coil domains, as well as the adjacent l <dig> region, are sufficient for trim <dig> dimerization. neither of the terminal domains ) is required for efficient dimerization. the estimates of the secondary structure content of the bccl <dig> protein at different temperatures are consistent with predictions that the coiled-coil domain of trim proteins is mostly alpha helical  <cit> . exposure to 45°c resulted in a dissociation of the dimer and a decrease in the helicity of the protein. the integrity of the dimer interface and that of a subset of the alpha-helical structures on trim <dig> may be interconnected. such a situation might be expected if dimeric contacts exist along the exposed surface of the alpha helices of each subunit of the dimer.

the bccl <dig> dimers formed higher-order structures. recently it has been reported that the full-length rhesus monkey trim5α protein forms dimers, trimers, hexamers and multimers of higher complexity in mammalian cells; the hexameric form in particular appeared to be the most abundant multimer  <cit> . trim5α multimerization does not involve disulfide bonds and is not affected by infection with restriction-sensitive viruses  <cit> . the formation of the functional trim <dig> higher-order oligomers depends upon specific b-box  <dig> amino acid residues  <cit> , several of which were altered in the bccl <dig> protein without apparent disruption of the higher-order oligomerization. however, multiple changes in the b-box  <dig> surface did decrease the amount of large bccl <dig> aggregates. this allowed more homogeneous preparations of a bccl <dig> variant, ller, to be analyzed by electron microscopy. single-particle analysis revealed that the lower-molecular-weight form of ller consisted of approximately 10-nm spheres. these ller forms likely represent dimers; consistent with this, many examples of complexes consisting of two anti-his <dig> antibodies bound to a single ller sphere were evident. the trim <dig> coiled coil, which is approximately  <dig> amino acid residues in length, could not be accommodated in these 10-nm spheres as a linear, rod-like structure; the existence of insertions at specific locations in the coiled coil regions of trim <dig> variants is consistent with the possibility that the coiled coil bends or folds back upon itself. the higher molecular weight ller complexes formed c-shaped structures, with an appendage protruding from the convex side of the arc. the size of these structures is larger than that expected for a dimer, and possibly represents a pentamer or hexamer. we do not know if these higher-order structures are biologically relevant; it may be that the trim5α domains ) not included in the bccl <dig> construct influence higher-order self-association either quantitatively or qualitatively. future work will explore these issues.

CONCLUSIONS
the central core of trim5α, consisting of the b-box  <dig>  coiled coil and l <dig> linker region, forms dimers that are largely alpha helical. the melting of the alpha-helical structure of this trim5α core was biphasic, with one transition at 42°c associated with a loss of dimerization, and a second transition at 80°c.
