BACKGROUND
flower development leads to the formation of functional male and female reproductive organs . at anthesis, the flower is completely open, anther dehiscence occurs, and pollen grains are released. the progamic phase begins when pollen grains land on the receptive stigma and germinate, forming a pollen tube that grows through the sporophytic tissues of the pistil. finally, the pollen tube reaches the female gametophyte and releases  <dig> sperm cells that fuse with the target cells of the embryo sac, allowing double fertilization. the result of this process is the formation of a diploid embryo and a triploid endosperm that constitute the seed. thus, the pistil is a place where multiple interactions between cells of different types, origin, and function occur  <cit> .

calcium is present in living organisms as a mixture of free, loosely bound, and bound cations. the different states of ca2+ are strongly correlated with its activity in cellular metabolism  <cit> . the pool of bound ca2+ is insoluble and serves mainly as a structural component. the loosely bound ca2+ pool has lower affinity and is the main form of calcium in most cell types  <cit> . this pool of ca2+ is often located in the cell walls and cellular organelles or is associated with specific proteins that use ca2+ as a coenzyme or regulate ca2+ concentration  <cit> . free ca2+ is one of the key signal molecules in plants and animals  <cit>  and is involved in multiple signal transduction pathways, which are fundamental for many intercellular and intracellular interactions  <cit> .

calcium plays an essential role in pollen-pistil interactions during the progamic phase  <cit> . studies on ca2+ signalling during pollen tube growth are numerous and constitute one of the main topics of plant physiology  <cit> . to date, it has been proven that ca2+ acts as a key factor for proper pollen germination and pollen tube growth, pollen tube guidance, and gamete fusion  <cit> . thus, it has been demonstrated that growing pollen tubes take up ca2+ ions from the medium  <cit> , and the ca2+ ions accumulate in the apical zone of the pollen tube, forming a characteristic tip-to-base gradient  <cit> . in the pistil, the optimal ca2+ concentration required for pollen germination is provided by the stigma  <cit> . most studies concerning the role of ca2+ in the pistil have been performed at the onset of anthesis  <cit> . nevertheless, studies on ca2+ dynamics in the pistil during flower formation are scarce.

fluorescence imaging of ca2+ has been extensively applied, mainly in animal cells, by using different fluorescence probes  <cit> . the most commonly used techniques of loading ca2+-sensitive dyes into plant samples are acid loading, electroporation, and microinjection  <cit> . however, the main limitations of the above-mentioned methods are as follows:  a relatively small area of dye application in the sample, which is restricted to single cells, and  the presence of esterases, which might potentially hydrolyze the dye esters, in the cell walls  <cit> . so far, the only study on the successful loading of a ca2+-sensitive dye into a whole plant organ was performed by zhang et al.  <cit> . they analyzed the intracellular localization of ca2+ in intact wheat roots loaded with the acetoxymethyl ester of fluo- <dig> 

up to date there are no reports concerning the calcium behaviour in the olive pistils. the purpose of this study was to analyze the contents and localization of free and loosely bound pools of ca2+ in the pistil of the olive, from pre- to post-anthesis period of flower development. previously, we provided a detailed cytological and histological description of the olive pistil tissues  <cit> . the pistil of the olive is composed of a wet stigma, a solid style, and a bilocular ovary with  <dig> ovules per loculus. however, only one ovule  is going to be fertilized, since majority of the olive seeds contain only one embryo  <cit> . we have also reported here the successful injection of the ca2+-sensitive dye fluo- <dig> into inflorescences as a useful tool for in situ ca2+ localization in the intact pistils.

RESULTS
experimental design
in situ detection of ca2+ in olive pistils was carried out by direct injection of the fluo- <dig> am dye into the peduncle of the inflorescence at the site of the cut, as shown in figure 1a. at each developmental stage, the pistil is composed of a bilobed, wet stigma; a short style; and a round ovary . the ovary encloses  <dig> loculi separated by a substantial placenta, and each loculus contains  <dig> ovules . within the phenologically mixed populations of the flowers, we selected  <dig> major developmental stages of the olive flower for further experiments : green buds ; opening flowers ; open flowers with petals recently separated; visible pistil and yellow, turgid, and intact anthers ; open flowers with dehiscent anthers ; and flowers without anthers and petals .

ca2+ content in floral organs during olive flower development
to compare the pistil ca2+ pool in relation to other parts of the flower, we analyzed ca2+ content during the whole course of olive flower development. the ca2+ content  in the extracts of separated floral organs is shown in figure  <dig>  at the green flower-bud stage , pistils, anthers, and petals contained similarly low amounts of ca2+, with exception calyx where calcium levels were slightly higher . when the sepals turned white , the pool of ca2+ in the analyzed floral organs was similar to that observed in the previous developmental stage . however, some decrease in the ca2+ content of the calyx was observed. when the flower was completely open , the pistil contained a significantly higher content of ca2+ than the other floral organs . in comparison with the previous developmental stages, more than 2-fold increase of the pistil ca2+ pool was observed at this stage. at the time of anther dehiscence , ca2+ content in the pistil was the highest among all floral organs . this increase was more than 6-fold in comparison with the green flower bud  and more than 3-fold when compared with flower with turgid anthers . at this stage of flower development, a significant amount of ca2+ was also found in the anthers , whereas in the petals and calyx, there were no significant differences in comparison to stage  <dig> . after anther loss , a strong decrease in ca2+ content was shown in the remaining floral organs, except the calyx, which suffered a slight increase in ca2+ concentration . for pistil, this decrease was more than 3-fold in comparison with that found in stage  <dig> 

a more detailed analysis of the changes in the olive pistil ca2+ pool was performed using the separated parts of the pistil: stigma with style and ovary . at stage  <dig>  the lowest pool of ca2+, with similar amounts of ca2+ in both pistil parts , was observed. during flower anthesis , the ca2+ pool increased progressively and reached the maximal values just after anther dehiscence . at the latest analyzed stage  a significant decrease of ca2+ levels was observed in the upper parts of the pistil  and in the ovary .

fluorescence in situ detection of ca2+ in the olive pistil
in order to follow the dynamic of free calcium ions in the olive pistils, the fluorescent indicator fluo- <dig> am was injected directly into the inflorescences. to confirm the presence of the incorporated fluo- <dig> am, we compared the fluorescence emitted by olive pistils from injected peduncles with that of the pistils taken from control peduncles . detailed analysis under a confocal microscope revealed significant differences between the levels of the signal in pistils treated with fluo- <dig> am and the control. after injection of fluo- <dig> am, green fluorescence was observed on the stigma surface, mostly attached to the papillae cells . control pistils were practically devoid of green fluorescence .

initially, ca2+ distribution in the external parts of developing pistils was analyzed using an epifluorescence stereomicroscope. all the samples analyzed at different stages of olive flower development showed the same fluorescence pattern . the pistil of the green flower bud  showed practically no fluorescent signal . during stage  <dig>  we observed a green signal located only in some areas of the stigmatic surface . in the open flower with turgid anthers , the green fluorescence was more expanded on the stigmatic surface, but the fluorescence pattern was not uniform . at anther dehiscence , the strong green fluorescence was extended to the complete stigmatic surface . when olive flowers lose petals and anthers , the fluorescence labelling was observed only in some regions of the stigmatic surface . no green fluorescence was observed in the pistil or other flower parts of the control flowers .

a more detailed analysis of the localization of the incorporated fluo- <dig> am in the pistil at stages  <dig> and  <dig>  which are highly significant for sexual plant reproduction events in flowering plants, was also performed . after anther dehiscence , the whole stigma surface showed an intense green labelling observed as associated with the papillae cell surface . histochemical staining with methylene-blue confirmed that, at this stage, the stigma was composed of radially oriented papillae cells and was covered with pollen grains, which lend yellowish fluorescence to some areas of the stigmatic surface . the pollen exine always emitted yellowish autofluorescence as it was observed on the negative controls  . after petal loss , the green fluorescence was much less intense and was localized only in some peripheral parts of the stigmatic surface . at this stage papillae degeneration occurred, as observed in the methylene blue-stained sections .

in the style of the pistil at stage  <dig>  the most intense labelling was located along the transmitting tissue, whereas the remaining stylar tissues showed relatively low staining . in the ovary, the strongest signal was detected in the ovule, beginning from the micropylar region . remarkable features of the fluo- <dig> am localization pattern were observed in transversally cut ovaries at stage  <dig> and  <dig> . the green fluorescence was observed only in  <dig> of the  <dig> ovules present in the ovary . intense labelling was also present in the area directly surrounding the  <dig> loculi and in the endocarp area. control reactions carried out by omitting the fluo- <dig> am dye from the injected solution showed no fluorescence in any part of the analyzed pistils . the accumulation of fluo3-am in just one ovule was found in  <dig> out of  <dig> ovaries at stage  <dig> and  <dig> out of  <dig> ovaries at stage  <dig> .

ultrastructural localization of ca2+ in the stigmatic tissues of the developing pistil
to study the subcellular distribution of ca2+ ions, we used the pyroantimonate method, which is used to localize free and loosely bound calcium. this method revealed many electron-dense precipitates in the cells of the different olive pistil tissues. precipitates were mainly localized in the large vacuoles and in the intercellular spaces . in the control sections, where the material was fixed without the addition of pyroantimonate, electron-dense precipitates did not occur . energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy -based analysis of the electron-dense precipitates showed peaks of sb and ca , confirming that these precipitates included ca <dig>  the reaction product of the pyroantimonate technique.

particularly interesting was the distribution of precipitates on the stigmatic surface of the developing pistil. in the green flower bud, no detectable ca2+ ions were observed in the papillae cells as well as at the stigmatic surface . at the beginning of anthesis , we found some electron-dense precipitates on the outer surface of the papilla cells and the stigmatic exudate . when the flower was open , a rich pool of fine and thick precipitates were localized in the papillae exudate layer . at the time of anther dehiscence, when the exudate was copious, numerous ca/sb precipitates were observed over the heterogeneous exudate matrix . after the loss of petals and anthers , the precipitates were present on the surface of papillae cells, which showed distinguishable signs of degeneration .

discussion
here, we used fluorescence microscopy for the in situ localization of ca2+ ions in intact olive pistils after fluo-  <dig> am injection into inflorescences. fluo- <dig> am, similar to other calcium indicators  must be introduced into the examined cells, and this step is a prerequisite to measure intracellular ca2+ ions by using microscopy imaging techniques. to introduce this dye into intact pistils, we injected the fluo- <dig> solution directly into olive inflorescences. to date, this is the first report on using a ca2+-sensitive dye in the form of an acetoxymethyl ester to follow ca2+ behaviour in plant reproductive organs. the presence of the dye inside the cells of the olive pistil indicates the following:  the amount of dye solution used was sufficient to penetrate the tissues of the inflorescence peduncle, whole flowers, and floral organs.  the concentration of fluo- <dig> esters introduced into the inflorescence tissues was enough to eliminate the previously reported potential problem of fluo- <dig> ester hydrolysis by cell wall hydrolases  <cit> .

as far as we know, there are no data in the literature reporting the ca2+ content in whole pistils during their development in angiosperms. most of the studies on ca2+ in pistil tissues focused on the period of full maturity and are frequently restricted to defined parts of the pistil, particularly the stigma and ovary  <cit> .

it is well known that ca2+ is involved in multiple intracellular and intercellular signalling pathways  <cit> . at the earliest analyzed stage of olive flower development , the levels of ca2+ were quite low. this is probably because buds at this stage are tightly closed and practically isolated from any external biotic and abiotic factors. furthermore, at this stage, the main task of the flower bud is to complete the growth and maturation of anthers and the pistil. consequently, the intensity of the signalling events in the stigma of the flower bud is low. as progress in flower development occurred, resulting in gradual petal whitening and flower opening , an increase in ca2+ levels, in parallel with its appearance in the stigma, was observed. at this time of olive flower development, we observed the following:  the beginning of exudate production and secretion by papillae cells and  accumulation of lipids, pectins, arabinogalactan proteins, and other components in the stigmatic tissues  <cit> . such increase in the metabolic activity of stigmatic tissues requires intensification of signalling events, in which ca2+ is thought to be a key player. at this stage of flower development, we showed the accumulation of ca/sb precipitates in the vacuoles of the stigma cells as well as in the intracellular spaces between them. the stigmatic surface is the main place for signal exchange between pollen and stigma. ca2+ ions are more abundant in the receptive stigmas than in the non-receptive surfaces  <cit> . the highest levels of ca2+ accumulation were observed in olive stigmatic tissues at the time of pollination. because in the olive the stigmatic receptivity is closely related with the pollination time, our results support a positive correlation between the ca2+ levels in the stigmatic exudates and the receptivity state of the stigma in the olive  <cit> . thus, we propose that the grade of fluorescence intensity of the incorporated fluo- <dig> am could be used as a potential marker of the degree of stigma receptivity.

the strong decrease of the ca2+ pool in the pistil at the last stages of pistil development coincides with the degradation of the stigma tissues. the decay of the stigma is the first step in the flower senescence process, which involves structural, biochemical, and molecular changes that lead to programmed cell death   <cit> . flower senescence is also known to be regulated by several signalling pathways involving ca2+. the presence of ca2+ in the stigmatic exudate at the end of the anthesis period might suggest that this cation is necessary for the onset of the senescence process  <cit> . indeed, serrano et al.  <cit>  reported that at the latest stage of olive flower development, once the stigma was completely brown, papillae cells exhibit pcd symptoms as a result of the incompatibility reaction between pollen and papillae stigma cells. in our opinion and according to our results, the papillae cells death is rather a consequence of their developmental program and the ca2+ accumulation observed in these cells might be one of the pcd hallmarks during stigma senescence.

significant changes in the stylar ca2+ pool were also observed at the time of anther dehiscence . the ca2+ labelling in the style was temporally correlated with the receptive phase of the stigma and pollination, since the stigmatic surface was covered with many pollen grains. it supports the involvement of the transmitting tissue in ca2+ delivery for pollen tube growth. it is well known that pollen tube growth requires ca2+ ions from the extracellular environment under both in vitro and in vivo conditions  <cit> . indeed, the presence of ca2+ in the style has been reported in petunia hybrida  <cit>  and in tobacco  <cit> . the implication of ca2+ in pollen tube growth and its guidance during the progamic phase has also been reported in other species  <cit> . in already pollinated flowers , the stigmatic and stylar pool of ca2+ decreased significantly in comparison to that in stage  <dig>  the low levels of detectable ca2+ along the style in the olive at this time of the reproduction course indicate that pollen tube growth through the stylar tissues is already complete.

the most striking features of ca2+ distribution in the olive pistil were observed in the ovary at the time of pollination  and fertilization . ca2+ was observed to specifically accumulate in one of the four ovules present in the ovary, whereas the remaining ovules showed no labelling. this localization pattern was observed in more than 80% of the ovaries at stage  <dig> and in more than 95% of the ovaries at stage  <dig>  it has been established that the micropyle contains high levels of ca2+, which closely correlate with fertility and serve probably as an attractant for the growing pollen tube  <cit> . in nicotiana and plumbago, the ca2+ concentration in the micropylar regions reached the peak when the pollen tube arrives  <cit> . chudzik and snieżko  <cit>  proposed that such an accumulation of ca2+ may serve as a marker of ovule receptivity. indeed, at stage  <dig>  in situ accumulation of ovular ca2+ was observed to start at the micropylar region. however, the presence of this specific "single-ovular" ca2+ labelling was still observed at the post-anthesis stage of flower development  when most of the flowers were successfully fertilized. according to the previous observations that in olive only  <dig> or  <dig>  ovules are fertilized  <cit> , we suggest that the observed ca2+ localization pattern might indicate which ovule will be fertilized or has been already fertilized.

it is well known that post-fertilization events leading to fruit formation include changes in the tissue developmental programs, which implicate a continuous exchange of signals between different types of cells  <cit> . ca2+ has been shown to play a crucial role in processes such as egg cell activation  <cit> , gamete fusion  <cit> , or embryo sac degeneration  <cit> . given that, we propose that ca2+ fluorescence can be used as a specific marker of fertilized ovules in multiovular ovaries. however, calcium level could remain high after fertilization of this ovule, so further experiments will be necessary to elucidate which explanation is the correct one.

CONCLUSIONS
this report describes the following for the first time:  the dynamics of ca2+ at the whole organ level during the course of pistil development;  the specific ca2+ labelling of only one ovule in the ovary, probably the one to be fertilized or already fertilized;  the close relationship between stigma senescence and ca2+ ions; and  introduction of labelling with ca2+-sensitive dyes as a useful marker of stigma receptivity during the flowering period. summing up, we propose that the progressive increase of the ca2+ pool during olive pistil development shown by us reflects the degree of pistil maturity and that ca2+ distribution at organ level can be used as a marker of fundamental events of sexual plant reproduction occurring in the pistil .
