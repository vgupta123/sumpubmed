BACKGROUND
olive is the main cultivated species belonging to the monophyletic oleaceae family, within the clade of asterids, in which the majority of nuclear and organellar genomic sequences are unknown. the olea genus includes two sections, olea and ligustroides. the former comprises the six recognised subspecies of the olive complex, which can be found throughout the mediterranean area as well as the temperate and subtropical regions of africa and asia. the mediterranean form  includes the wild  and cultivated  olives  <cit> .

recently, chloroplast genome sequencing of species belonging to this family from the tribe of jasmineae revealed that two genera, jasminum and menodora, carry several distinctive rearrangements, including inversions, gene duplications, insertions, inverted repeat expansions and gene/intron losses  <cit> . one of these genomic features involves the duplication of the rpl <dig> protein-coding gene in jasminum. a similar duplication has also been detected in the poaceae, and in both oleaceae and poaceae, the duplicated copy has been inserted into the intergenic region between rbcl and psai  <cit> . by comparative gene mapping and sequencing, lee and co-workers also demonstrated that all other oleaceae genera, including olea, have an identical gene content and order as nicotiana tabacum. a phylogenetic reconstruction of the entire family, based upon the sequences of the ndhf and rbcl genes, partially confirmed previous results obtained by the analysis of the trnl-f and rps <dig> chloroplast regions  <cit> .

intraspecies variation within other oleaceae genera, such as syringa  <cit> , forsythia  <cit> , ligustrum  <cit>  and fraxinus  <cit>  has also been examined.

different chlorotypes have been identified among the six subspecies of o. europaea. lumaret et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> distinct chlorotypes by rflp analysis of dna isolated from the purified chloroplasts of a wide set of o. europaea taxa. in other o. europaea subspecies baldoni et al.  <cit>  identified nine nucleotide substitutions, one insertion-deletion  and a polymorphic poly-t ssr in the trnt-l region. besnard et al.  <cit>  in the o. europaea complex identified fourteen polymorphisms in three chloroplast regions , including five microsatellite motifs, two indels and eight nucleotide substitution sites. recently, the analysis of four regions  was used to demonstrate the polyphyletic origin of the olea genus and estimate the divergence times for the major groups of olea species and subspecies during the tertiary period  <cit> .

in cultivated olives chloroplasts are maternally inherited  <cit>  and, in contrast to that seen at the subspecies level, a low plastidial variability was detected. a strong linkage disequilibrium between the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes has been demonstrated, particularly for the mediterranean cultivated and wild olives , suggesting that a low level of recurrent mutations occurs in both organellar genomes of the olive  <cit> .

in particular, rflp analysis of chloroplast dna isolated from  <dig> cultivars revealed that most cultivars have a common chlorotype  <cit> . besnard et al.  <cit> , using two microsatellites and  <dig> rflps on more than  <dig> olive cultivars, were able to distinguish only four chlorotypes. the majority of cultivars was characterised by the chlorotype ce <dig>  which likely originated from the wild olive populations of the eastern mediterranean and was spread to the western part through cultivar dispersal by humans. polymorphisms at the varietal level have been detected in the trnd-t locus  <cit> , but only one polymorphism in this locus was found within a set of  <dig> cultivars  <cit> .

chloroplast dna represents an ideal system for plant species dna barcoding, and some chloroplast regions have been indicated as ideal for use in tests that discriminate between different land plants. based on assessments of recoverability, sequence quality and discriminatory abilities at the species level, the two-locus combination of rbcl-matk has been recommended as a universal framework for plant barcoding  <cit> . the combination of trnh-psba coupled with rbcl has been recommended for dna barcoding to discriminate between lower taxonomic ranks such as genera or related species  <cit> . in highly valuable crop species, such as the olive, that have a variety of cultivars available in the market, however, typing at the species level is not sufficient. thus, the development of reliable methods to rapidly and efficiently discriminate between cultivars has become a pressing need. in addition, dna barcoding may have useful applications to tracking food products  <cit>  and the analysis of archaeological remains  <cit> .

in this respect, the availability of complete chloroplast genome sequences from a growing number of species offers the opportunity to evaluate many potentially polymorphic sites and identify new regions that could be used to define cultivar dna barcodes.

there are numerous approaches to sequence chloroplast genomes: traditional sequence analysis of highly purified chloroplast dna, as applied for solanum lycopersicum  <cit> , lolium perenne  <cit> , trachelium caeruleum  <cit> , jasminum nudiflorum  <cit>  and parthenium argentatum  <cit> ; rolling circle amplification  of high-purity chloroplast dna, as demonstrated in cicer arietinum  <cit> , platanus occidentalis  <cit>  and welwitschia mirabilis  <cit> ; shot gun sequence analysis of bac clones containing chloroplast genomic inserts, as demonstrated in vitis vinifera  <cit> , hordeum vulgare  <cit>  and brachypodium distachyon  <cit> ; and the use of universal primers based on chloroplast sequences highly conserved among most angiosperm species to amplify overlapping fragments  <cit> , as demonstrated in cycas taitungensis  <cit>  and two bambusa species  <cit> . for this study, the last approach was used to sequence the entire chloroplast genome of the o. europaea subsp. europaea cv. frantoio. the resulting availability of the entire plastome allowed to evaluate the sequence arrangement of the plastid genome in o. europaea and to identify new organellar polymorphisms that could discriminate between cultivated olive varieties.

RESULTS
size, gene content and gene order of the olive chloroplast genome
the complete plastome of olive, cv. frantoio has a total length of  <dig>  bp , with the typical structure found in the unrearranged chloroplast genomes of angiosperms. it includes an  <dig> -bp large single copy  and a  <dig> -bp small single copy  region separated by a pair of inverted repeats , each  <dig>  bp long . coding dna  accounts for  <dig> % of the genome and includes protein coding genes , trnas  and rrnas , while noncoding dna  accounts for the remaining  <dig> % and includes introns  and intergenic spacers . the olive plastome contains  <dig> unique genes , with  <dig> of these genes  duplicated in the ir for a total of  <dig> genes. in addition, the duplicated region includes a partial cds for ycf <dig>  as in other species like typha  <cit> . there are  <dig> intron-containing genes,  <dig> of which contain one intron and  <dig>  with two introns. the rps <dig> gene is trans-spliced, with the 5' end located in the lsc and the 3' end duplicated in the ir regions. the nucleotide composition of the olive chloroplast genome comprises  <dig> % gc and  <dig> % at.

the in silico search for repetitive elements identified  <dig> mono-nucleotide ssrs with  <dig> or more repeat units , with  <dig> poly-a,  <dig> poly-t,  <dig> poly-c and  <dig> poly-g repeats. in addition, six di-nucleotide ssrs with five or six repeat units, no tri-nucleotide ssrs, three tetra- and two penta-nucleotide ssrs were identified, for a total of  <dig> repetitive sequences. the distribution of ssrs across the chloroplast genome was as follows:  <dig> in the lsc ,  <dig> in the ssc  and  <dig>  in the ir region .

ssrs analyzed for polymorphism are given in bold. * mononucleotide ssrs with less than  <dig> repeats were not determined.

the repeat analysis also identified  <dig> interspersed repetitive sequences longer than  <dig> bp, each having 2- <dig> repetitions and a sequence identity higher than 85% . these long interspersed repetitive sequences included two tandem repeats in the ycf <dig> gene and five palindromic sequences . three of the four repeats found within the ycf <dig> exon were tandem repeats, as previously observed in v. vinifera  <cit> . there were only two inverted repeats, all the others were direct repeats. five repeats were located within cds, two repeats were found in the introns of the ycf <dig> and ndha genes and all others were in the intergenic spacers . interspersed repeats did not cause any uncertainty during the sequencing process because they were quite short , with a low number of repetitions and primers were never constructed on the repeats.

olive chloroplast genome organisation
the sequence of the olive chloroplast genome represents one of the first contributions to deciphering the genetic background of this important tree crop species and was used to verify that rearrangements observed in the plastomes of other genera of oleaceae, such as jasminum and menodora, were not represented in o. europaea. in fact, in contrast to what observed in the jasminum and menodora plastomes  <cit> , the olive chloroplast maintains a size range, organisation and gene order typical of most land plants, such as members of the vitis, populus, citrus, eucalyptus, coffea and arabidopsis genera. based on the phylogeny of oleaceae inferred from the ndhf and rbcl genes  <cit> , jasminum and menodora were already known to be unusual genera within the family, and all other tribes, including oleae, to which the olea genus belongs, do not share their combination of multiple mutational events. the highly conserved plastome organization of the olive allowed universal primers and genome walking with consensus primers to be used to amplify most of the lsc region.

identification of new plastid markers to discriminate between olive cultivars
to detect intervarietal polymorphisms, a preliminary screening of the intergenic spacer trns-gcu - trng-ucc, previously demonstrated to be polymorphic among olive varieties  <cit> , was performed on a set of  <dig> cultivars having different geographical distributions and representing a wide range of morphological and agronomical phenotypes . a sub-set of eight highly variable cultivars  was further examined for  <dig> potentially polymorphic regions.

the tested potential variant domains have shown different levels of variability. fifteen of the analyzed intergenic spacers contained mutations within the sequence of the eight cultivars, ranging in number from one to six per region. these mutations were microsatellites, indels or single nucleotide polymorphisms . one snp was located within the intron of the rpoc <dig> gene, and three others were located in the coding regions  of the rpl <dig>  ndhf and ycf <dig> genes. the cds-snps resulted in substitutions at aminoacidic position  <dig> in rpl <dig> , at  <dig> aa in ndhf , and at  <dig> and  <dig>  aa in ycf <dig> . blast analyses revealed that the ndhf alanine and the ycf <dig> leucine, widely represented in other species, are present in farga and frantoio cultivars, respectively. also the rpl <dig> polymorphism can be found in other species, as is the case for the phenylalanine aminoacid, present in the v. vinifera cv. pinot noir in the mitochondrial copy of this gene, due to the incorporation of more than 42% of the vitis chloroplast genome into its mitochondrial genome  <cit> . on this respect, the risk that our chloroplast olive markers may reside on mitochondrial or nuclear genes has been prevented by amplifying coding regions anchored on the intergenic spacers and confirmed by the absence of sequence ambiguities.

the comparison of the frantoio chloroplast sequence with ests deriving from fruits of cvs. coratina and tendellone showed some sequence mismatches, but they were not confirmed by resequencing the corresponding genomic regions in coratina and tendellone cultivars.

overall, the analysis of cpdna sequences from the eight cultivars resulted in the identification of  <dig> polymorphic sites,  <dig> of which represent new and never-described plastid variants . sixteen polymorphic sites were mono-nucleotide ssrs: eight poly-a, including one with an irregular motif; seven poly-t and one poly-c. the remaining polymorphisms included  <dig> snps and  <dig> indels. thirty-three polymorphic sites  were located within the lsc region, one  within the ir and six  within the ssc . the indel p <dig> was identified within the repeat of the rps <dig> - rpl <dig> spacer, but none of the other repetitive regions was polymorphic between cultivars.

the chloroplast sequence of cv. frantoio was also compared with all previously sequenced regions of the olive chloroplast, particularly with the plastome sequence of cv. bianchera, which has been recently deposited in the genbank database . more than  <dig> mismatches were detected between the bianchera and frantoio sequences. surprisingly, not one of these polymorphisms fell within the previously identified cultivar-specific polymorphic regions. to verify if these mismatches might represent real sequence differences between the two varieties, most of the ambiguous regions were reamplified and resequenced in both cultivars . these analyses confirmed the sequence of cv. frantoio and showed an absolute sequence identity with that obtained from the cv. bianchera in all of these regions, including the exons of the rpoc <dig> and ndhf genes, carrying 27- and 9-bp indels, respectively. the differences detected between the two olive plastome sequences can not derive from an incorrect identification of the bianchera genotype because, in that case, mutations should have been found in the polymorphic sites and not randomly along the chloroplast genome. more likely, divergences may be attributed to sequence uncertainties in the bianchera plastome sequence deposited in genbank.

the new markers identified in this study can distinguish six haplotypes among eight cultivars. therefore, these new markers hold great promise for the identification of new cultivar haplotypes and for use in dna barcoding systems to distinguish between different cultivars.

comparison of plastome variation between cultivars and with other olea taxa
based on previous chloroplast sequence analyses, olive cultivars belong to the cp-ii lineage and have been classified into three sublineages  and four chlorotypes   <cit> . these chlorotypes were defined by evaluating length variations in the psbk-psbi, trns-trng, rps2-rpoc <dig>  trne-trnt and atpb-rbcl regions among more than  <dig> cultivars  <cit> .

several polymorphisms had been previously identified in the partial sequence of the trnk intron  by analysing the subspecies cuspidata, laperrinei, maroccana, cerasiformis, guanchica, europaea var. sylvestris  and the cornicabra cultivar, but none of these polymorphisms were found among the cultivars we have analysed. the psbk-psbi and trns-gcu-trng-ucc regions, spanning the polymorphic sites p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  were analyzed by besnard et al.  <cit>  as fragment length variation on a set of different o. europaea taxa including cultivars. that analysis revealed intercultivar variability only at p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> but was unable to keep the c/t and g/t snps in the p <dig> and p <dig> sites, respectively. we treated the a/t/- polymorphism, closely linked to p <dig>  as a different polymorphism  because the a/- indel is present in most varieties while the t is a rare mutation carried by few cultivars.

the spacer rps2-rpoc <dig>  spanning the polymorphic sites p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  generated five different chlorotypes among the eight varieties analysed, demonstrating a high level of rearrangement within cultivars. this region corresponds to the ccmp <dig> microsatellite  <cit> , but previous studies that analysed only length polymorphisms were unable to capture the complexity of this region. p <dig> includes ccmp <dig>  <cit>  and an additional snp polymorphism  captured in the flanking region.

intrieri et al.  <cit>  reported the identification of  <dig> snps and  <dig> indels in the trnd-trnt region of  <dig> cultivars. analyzing a different set of cultivars, besnard  <cit>  did not detect these polymorphisms. similarly, only two polymorphisms were confirmed in our cultivar set: the poly-a ssr  and the c/t snp .

other regions previously analysed in different olea taxa, such as trnl-f and rps <dig>  <cit> , trnl-trnf  <cit> , and trnt-trnl  <cit>  were not polymorphic among our cultivars.

no differences between the eight cultivars were found within the matk and psba exons or the rps <dig> intron, regions used for species barcoding. in contrast, the psbk-psbi and trnh-psba barcoding regions, both representing markers for plant species identification  <cit> , correspond to our p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> polymorphisms. this observation indicates that these markers may not accurately discriminate between some species, given their potential intra-specific genetic variations  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the low level of cpdna variation detected up to now within olive cultivars represented a serious obstacle to the widespread use of cpdna markers for cultivar characterization, parentage analysis and population genetics. the most probable causes of the high level of sequence conservation may be related to the domestication process, by which most cultivars were likely derived from only a few different wild plants, and the low generation turnover resulting from the long life span of the trees, which reduces the rate of emergence of new mutations.

in this study, using eight cultivars,  <dig> new cpdna markers were identified from the olive plastome sequence and  <dig> markers previously reported were confirmed. in fact, the availability of the entire chloroplast genome and systematic sequencing of candidate regions from selected cultivars resulted in the identification of many new polymorphisms, mostly represented by nucleotide substitutions and by rearrangements of different microsatellites. they were not discovered in previous analyses likely because these focused mostly on fragment length variations.

the  <dig> markers applied to eight cultivars were able to split them into six different chlorotypes. the ten known markers are able to establish to which lineages the olive varieties may correspond and to reconstruct their phylogeny with potential ancestors, while the new markers should allow to break down cultivated olives into new chlorotypes and to finely assign them to different lineages within the mediterranean o. europaea complex. these markers could provide a valuable contribution to understanding the evolutionary and ecological processes involved in olive domestication as well as to increase the knowledge about the function of plastid genes on plant metabolism.

they could be used to screen olive genotypes, to assess the chlorotype distribution among cultivars and to better determine their phylogenetic relationships with the wild populations as well as with other o. europaea subspecies. this could help reconstruct the origin of the cultivated olive and to determine the timeline involved in the distribution of chlorotypes from traditional varieties throughout the mediterranean region.

most of these polymorphisms showed a high level of reorganization among cultivars, particularly in the intergenic regions such as psaa-ycf <dig>  rps2-rpoc <dig> and trns-gcu-trng-ucc. this observation demonstrates that after rearrangements occurred within the plastid genome, these changes were fixed and maintained within cultivars by vegetative propagation. the putative functional role that these mutations may play in modifying the metabolism of olive cultivars and in developing adaptations to the environment, will also represent a further contribution to understanding the genetic background of the olive, providing insights into the evolution of plant phenotypes. the application of these polymorphisms as functional markers will also be considered.

finally, these polymorphisms represent a new source of markers for olive dna barcoding to distinguish between cultivars, for practical applications related to dna-based tracking of olive oil and the identification of archaeological remains. one particular focus involves their potential use in dna tracking of food products derived from the olive , based on the assumptions that: i) the high number of chloroplasts per cell increases the probability that trace amounts of dna can be amplified from these food products; ii) their maternal origin excludes the risk that dna from pollinators would be amplified instead; iii) the haploid chloroplast genome can produce cultivar-specific single signals.

the identification of  <dig> new polymorphic sites, most of which are located in chloroplast regions previously unexplored in cultivated o. europaea, demonstrates that chloroplast variation in olive cultivars is higher than expected and that new chlorotypes could be discovered through the analysis of a larger number of cultivars.
