BACKGROUND
interstitial cystitis  is a chronic bladder disorder characterized by a combination of symptoms including pelvic pain, urinary urgency, and urinary frequency. the estimated prevalence of ic ranges from  <dig> to over  <dig> cases per  <dig>  individuals, with a predominance of cases found in women  <cit> . upon cystoscopy, ic can be divided into a classic disease with hunner's ulcer and a non-ulcerative disease  <cit> . the relationship between these two subtypes is not known and it has been suggested that they represent separate disease entities  <cit> . patients with classic ic are older and have a lower bladder capacity than patients with non-ulcerative ic  <cit> . histological examination of bladder biopsies from classic ic patients reveals mucosal ulceration and extensive inflammation  <cit> . the etiology of ic is unknown, but many theories have been proposed, including neurogenic inflammation with mast cell activation; absorption of potentially toxic substances across the urothelium; a deficient glycosaminoglycan mucus layer and a "leaky" urothelium triggering a chronic inflammatory reaction in the subepithelial layers; or an allergic or autoimmune process  <cit> . there is no evidence that ic is caused by bacterial infection  <cit> .

because no molecular marker assay is available, ic today is diagnosed by symptom assessment, physical examination, routine urine analysis, cystoscopy, and sometimes bladder biopsy. the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases  elaborated a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria for the diagnosis of ic for research purposes  <cit> . inclusion criteria require a cystoscopy under anesthesia positively identifying hunner's ulcer or glomerulations . other inclusion criteria are bladder pain and/or urinary urgency  <cit> . the niddk excludes patients with a bladder capacity larger than  <dig> ml, patients with a symptom duration of less than nine months, patients with urinary frequency less than eight times a day and with an absence of nocturia, and patients who can successfully be treated with antimicrobials, urinary antiseptics, anticholinergics or antispasmodics. the niddk criteria can be fully satisfied by 40% of all ic patients  <cit> .

mast cells may play a central role in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of ic  <cit> . mast cells migrate into tissue perivascular spaces, and upon activation secrete granule-stored or de novo-synthesized molecules that mediate inflammatory reactions  <cit> .

research has focused on finding objective markers for this disease. urine analysis of ic patients who fulfilled the niddk criteria showed an increase in antiproliferative factor , a decrease in heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor , and an increase in epidermal growth factor   <cit> . apf, a glycosylated nonapeptide  <cit> , is the biomarker with the most specificity for ic  <cit> , suggesting its potential use in diagnostic testing. however, no test for apf is commercially available, and the regulation of apf production, as well as apf's role in causing symptoms, are uncertain  <cit> . many apf experiments were done with explanted epithelial cells in culture  <cit>  – a condition that only represents one aspect of the in vivo situation. more potential ic markers have been identified by urine analysis. these are, for example, inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain h <dig>  <cit> , neutrophil elastase  <cit> , insulin-like growth factor binding protein- <dig>  <cit> , il- <dig>  <cit>  or glycoprotein gp <dig>  <cit> .

directly analyzing gene expression in bladder biopsies allows us to use a different approach for the molecular characterization of ic. we looked for any significant differences in mrna levels between bladder cells from ic patients with ulcers vs. bladder cells from healthy controls. even though ulcerative ic represents only a fraction of all ic patients, this criteria allows for examination of a relatively homogenous patient population. the global approach of gene expression arrays has offered new information on ulcerative ic and has provided us with data for defining a characteristic pattern of "marker genes" for this subtype of the disease.

RESULTS
description of patients
to accurately define a characteristic pattern of "marker genes", patient selection was crucial. creating a relatively homogenous patient population required including only ic patients with hunner's ulcer. table  <dig> summarizes the clinical characteristics of the five ic and the six control patients selected for our study. all patients are white females, and for all patients an acute bacterial infection was excluded. in urine specimens collected prior to surgery, no bacterial growth was found. only one patient, classic ic patient  <dig>  had leukocytes in the urine sample. since this patient has very severe glomerulations, this was due to acute bleeding rather than due to a urinary tract infection. there also was no evidence for a chronic urinary tract infection since pcr analyses of representative bladder biopsies were negative for a selection of bacterial or viral pathogens . four control patients did not have any symptoms related to ic, but underwent vaginal prolapse surgery after biopsy removal. two control patients, patient  <dig> and patient  <dig>  had bladder-related symptoms. patient  <dig> had urgency and frequency for  <dig> months, only minor pain, and a bladder capacity of  <dig> ml. thus, this patient meets the relaxed eligibility criteria for the ic database study  <cit> . histopathology data analysis from patient  <dig> shows an intact urothelium with a slight increase in mast cell counts in the detrusor muscle, suggesting a mild form of ic. patient  <dig> did not meet the inclusion criteria for the ic database study, having neither urgency nor frequency and a localized pain sensation for only three months. upon histopathological analysis, patient  <dig> was diagnosed with cystitis glandularis et cystica. ic patients with ulcers are relatively old and the age difference between the two investigated patient groups was close to statistical significance . all patients except one  are postmenopausal. previous studies also report an older age for ulcerative patient groups  <cit> . no common medical history was found among the patients. of note is that one of the classic ic patients has chronic polyarthritis, and another has polymyalgia rheumatica, but none of the patients have a history of a lymphatic disease.

raw data evaluation
from each ic patient, two bladder biopsies were analyzed, one from an ulcer area , and one from a non-ulcer area . the correlation plot shows the pair-wise comparison of all chips . white or light grey squares correspond to similar gene expression, and black or dark-grey squares correspond to different gene expression. gene expression among the healthy control group and also among the ulcerative group shows a good correlation . a comparison of all ic patient samples  with the healthy controls reveals a clear difference in gene expression . one exception is patient sample  <dig> ni that has a gene expression similar to the healthy controls. gene expression of sample  <dig> ni is different from the other four ni samples:  <dig> ni,  <dig> ni,  <dig> ni and  <dig> ni. there are only minor differences between ulcer and ni samples. previous research has primarily focused on areas of the bladder with the most severe pathology  <cit> . however, the results from the correlation plot  encouraged us to perform the statistical evaluations  for the five ni samples  in comparison to the six healthy controls .

genechip expression data analysis
genechip expression arrays were used to compare the population of ulcerative ic patients  with the population of healthy controls . from a total of  <dig>  tested probe sets  <dig>   were found to be present  . the difference in mrna levels between the two groups is significant for  <dig>  probe sets as determined by the t-test statistics   <dig> %) . using these statistical constraints, we were able to focus on genes expressed in the mid-to-high range . of the  <dig>  significant probe sets,  <dig>  showed an ic  to healthy expression ratio greater than two . this corresponds to  <dig>  proteins that are potentially over- or under-represented in ulcerative ic by a factor of two or more .

interestingly, many of the  <dig> proteins with the highest ic-to-healthy expression ratios are expressed in b-leukocytes . therefore, b-cell invasion into the bladder wall could be proposed as a dominant feature of ulcerative ic. our results also show that characteristic genes for t-lymphocytes are significantly up-regulated in ulcerative ic; however, they do not rank among the top  <dig>  as urothelial cells can also be involved in immune response  <cit> , the possibility that gene expressions in the urothelium make a minor contribution to these findings cannot be excluded. however, the urothelial cells represent only a small fraction of our biopsy samples . strong evidence for b- and t-cell infiltration came from cluster analysis using genevestigator  <cit> . this reference expression database and meta-analysis system predicted the top  <dig> markers for both b- and t-lymphocytes, respectively. the two lists of probe sets were generated from the database independent of our results . interestingly, many top markers are significantly up-regulated in our ulcerative ic patient samples  and convincingly confirm b- and t-cell infiltration of the bladder wall. nine of the top  <dig> gene expressions  were present in the top  <dig> probe sets for b-lymphocytes .

histopathology data
biopsies of ic patients and control patients were also investigated microscopically. ideally, three layers of the bladder wall, namely the urothelium , the submucosa  and the muscularis propria , are included in a single biopsy. histological data of the biopsies from our ic patients showed a complete  or a partial  denudation of the urothelium, a feature commonly found in classic ic  <cit> . care was taken to remove biopsies of similar sizes; however, the depths of the biopsies vary, as do the relative ratios of the cell layers. for all ic patients, hematoxylin and eosin  staining of representative bladder sections confirmed a severe inflammation characterized by lymphocyte and plasma cell invasion in the deeper areas  of the biopsies . these findings strongly support our gene expression data and agree with previously reported results  <cit> . the submucosa of control patient  <dig> was covered by a urothelial layer . even though the control showed a minor unspecific subepithelial inflammation , deeper areas of the biopsy did not demonstrate the severe leukocyte infiltration as found in ulcerative ic . mastocytosis has been credited with a central role in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of ic  <cit> . all of our classic ic patients showed an increase in mast cells in the detrusor muscle and in the lamina propria .

important processes in ulcerative ic
the erminej software program identified gene ontology  categories that are overrepresented in the significant genes found for ulcerative ic  <cit> . we examined overrepresentation of go categories in the up- and down-regulated genes separately. the significance of overrepresentation of go categories is much higher for up-regulated genes than for down-regulated genes . in the three ontologies "biological process," "molecular function," and "cellular component," the best overlaps were found for the go categories "immune system process" , "signal transducer activity" , and "plasma membrane" , respectively . these data support our findings of leukocyte infiltration in ulcerative ic. they furthermore suggest that chemotactic signals are recognized by receptors in the plasma membrane of these cells, which in turn elicit an intracellular signaling cascade eventually regulating gene expression.

* up-regulated go categories with a corrected p-value <  <dig> e- <dig> are listed, the top-down regulated go category of the respective analysis is shown. for "cellular components down" no significant go category has been found.

in metacore analysis, immune reaction processes were found to be dominant in ulcerative ic . the top process found was "cell adhesion_leucocyte chemotaxis". the six cytokine/chemokine genes encoding cxcl <dig>  ccl <dig>  il- <dig>  ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and groa rank within the top seven genes of this process. receptors and adhesion molecules are also over-represented .

the two processes "bcr pathway"  and "tcr signaling"  were found to be among the most significant processes . in tcr signaling, two signals of antigen-presenting-cells are necessary to stimulate t-cells. these are cd80/cd <dig> and class ii mhc on the antigen presenting cell, and cd <dig> and tcr on the t-cell  <cit> . the genes encoding these proteins are overexpressed in our array data.

in figure  <dig>  the map of the bcr pathway is shown with the log ratios of the ni-samples over the healthy samples, visualized as thermometers. only pathway components with red thermometers, indicating up-regulation in the ni-samples, were found. the b-cell antigen receptor pathway is involved in the development, survival and activation of b lymphocytes  <cit> . membrane immunoglobulins bind to their specific antigens, and together with the cd79a/cd79b heterodimer, transduce the signal via a cytoplasmic signaling cascade involving protein tyrosine kinases lyn and btk and phospholipase γ , activating transcription factors nf-at or nf-κ b. these factors in turn play key roles in the induction of immune response genes and inflammation  <cit> . a key regulatory element in b-cell development is transcription factor pax <dig> . gene expression profile studies in mouse models suggest that pax <dig> is essential for b-cell commitment  <cit> . pax <dig> promotes b lymphopoiesis by activating b-cell specific genes ; is essential for v-dj recombination of the igh locus; maintains b-cell fate in more mature cells; and represses genes whose expression is not b-cell specific. even though these studies cannot not be directly compared to our experiments, it is interesting to note that the pax5-dependent genes cd <dig> and cd79a were among the highly expressed genes found in our study .

comparison of the gene expression profiles of ulcerative ic and other diseases
the genego software program defines signature genes for diseases by collecting all available data related to a certain disease   <cit> . by using this computational tool, overlaps of our significant gene expression data with the signature genes of other diseases can be identified, and the significance of these overlaps can be determined.

the forty disease categories having the most similar gene expression to that found in bladder biopsies of ulcerative ic patients are summarized in table  <dig>  immune system diseases, lymphatic diseases and autoimmune diseases are the most significant. these categories include different numbers of proteins. large categories, such as "immune system diseases"  are more general and contain proteins also found in smaller, more specialized categories. while these data do not imply a similar gene expression in bladder biopsies of e.g. lymphoma and ulcerative ic patients, the data suggest a relationship between these two diseases, primarily due to the shared importance of b-cell markers.

differences in gene expression in ulcer tissue vs. non-ulcer tissue from patients with hunner's ulcers 
the populations of five ulcer tissues  and five non-ulcer tissues  were compared by genechip expression array analysis . from a total of  <dig>  tested probe sets  <dig>  were found to be present . the difference in mrna levels between the two groups was significant for  <dig> probe sets as determined by the t-test statistics  . one hundred and fourteen of the  <dig> significant probe sets showed an ulcer vs. non-ulcer expression ratio greater than two .

the significantly up-regulated genes of the ulcus-vs-ni comparison had the best overlaps with the go categories "wound healing"  for "biological process" , "glycosaminoglycan binding"  for "molecular function"  and "extracellular region"  for "cellular component"  .

discussion
our data provide a global picture of the differences between mrna levels of bladder biopsies from classic ic patients and from healthy controls. in the ni-vs-healthy comparison, non-ulcer tissue of classic ic patients  and tissue from healthy controls  have been compared, and in the ulcus-vs-ni comparison, ulcer  and non-ulcer tissues  have been compared.

the ni-vs-healthy comparison yielded over  <dig>  significant changes at an fdr of  <dig> %, which means there is a possibility that a discrete gene could be a false positive. however, the majority of the detected changes can be attributed to genuine differences in non-ulcer and healthy tissue . in contrast, the ulcus-vs-ni comparison yielded only  <dig> significant changes at an fdr of  <dig> %, meaning the likelihood is only about 50% that a randomly picked "significant" gene is truly differentially expressed in ulcer vs. non-ulcer tissue . this suggests that the ulcer and non-ulcer tissue of patients with hunner's ulcer have only small differences in gene expression. an analysis with a significantly larger set of patients would probably have the statistical power to identify those changes more reliably. given our limited set of patients, we obtained a rather unreliable set of approximately  <dig> differentially expressed genes, and therefore, our results of the associated go categories should be regarded as an indication of how ulcer and non-ulcer biopsies may differ.

as the gene expression arrays used in our study cover all known human mrnas , previous gene expression data on ic can be compared with our results.

keay and others have published microarray analysis data investigating gene expression differences in explanted epithelial cells from bladder biopsies  <cit> . they focused on approximately  <dig>  genes and compared differences between ic patients  and asymptomatic controls, and differences between normal epithelial cells treated with apf, or with mock apf. one of the  <dig> genes discussed in their publication was significant in our ni-vs-healthy comparison. this was "neutral amino acid transporter b" which was, as in their results, down-regulated . we anticipated only minor overlaps between the data from their paper and our results since histopathological data from our investigated bladder biopsies indicated that urothelial cells contribute only a minor part of all cell types . even if there were differences in urothelial gene expression between our two investigated subgroups, they might be too subtle to be detected. furthermore, many of the  <dig> genes were ubiquitously expressed genes , and as we primarily examined cell types other than epithelial cells, this must lead to different results.

hurst and co-workers addressed the question of abnormalities in the urothelium of ic patients  <cit> . with a set of immunostainings against proteoglycan core proteins and differentiation markers, they investigated biopsies of  <dig> ic patients  and five controls having stress incontinence  <cit> . they scored their data from - <dig>  to + <dig> , and their findings suggested abnormal differentiation in the ic urothelium. many of the proteins investigated in their study were present in both ic and control biopsies, but were localized at different sites . gene expression analyses of entire biopsies, as performed in our study, give no information on spatial distributions. moreover, the amount of urothelium was reduced in our biopsies, and the presence of a protein and its respective mrna will not necessarily need to correlate. taking these three points into account, it is expected that genes encoding the proteins found by hurst would not be significantly regulated in our analysis. interestingly, two genes, keratin- <dig> and uroplakin-1b were considerably up-regulated  in the healthy controls, in agreement with the findings of hauser et al.   <cit> .

generally, the presence of mrna and the presence of the encoded protein do not need to correlate. temporal and spatial differences in expression are likely. regulation of mrna translation, protein processing, protein stability and protein translocation are all factors that influence a direct correlation between an mrna and its mature protein.

inflammatory features in ic have been investigated by histological analysis. peeker and fall  <cit>  defined a clear picture of ulcerative or classic ic that included urothelial spongiosis and detachment; subepithelial, perineural and perivascular deposits of mononuclear cells; and a characteristic mast cell response, with an increase of mast cells in detrusor muscle and in the lamina propria. in addition, other groups reported extensive bladder inflammation of patients with ulcer  <cit> . with our restriction to classic ic we were able to characterize a relatively homogenous group of patients. while our data agreed with reported histological findings, they additionally provided us with a series of potential gene expression markers for this subtype of the disease.

the generation of a gene expression profile for non-ulcerative ic is expected to be more difficult. in contrast to classic ic, literature regarding non-ulcerative ic described a heterogeneous picture with respect to inflammation. peeker and fall  <cit>  selected their patients according to the niddk criteria and reported no inflammatory signs and a less prominent mast cell involvement in non-ulcerative ic. erickson et al.  <cit>  also evaluated their patients according to the niddk cystoscopic criteria. severe inflammation was seen in 30% of the patients who met the criteria and in 23% who did not. ulcers were reported for only four patients . also denson et al.  <cit> , who used the niddk inclusion criteria, described mononuclear infiltration as the most consistent histological feature . in another study by erickson et al.  <cit> , up to 35% of the non-ulcerative patients had severe inflammations.

we can conclude that patient evaluation and selection for a gene expression profile of non-ulcerative ic is crucial and challenging. very likely, a careful subdivision of this heterogeneous patient group will be indispensable to obtain statistically significant results.

an interesting and unexpected result of our study was the severe inflammatory infiltration at non-ulcer  sites of a bladder with hunner's ulcer . in the literature, many research groups have not focused on such tissue, but have instead analyzed biopsies of the most severely affected part of the bladder . factors released from an ulcer region, or, more generally, from an abnormal urothelium, may have paracrine influences on surrounding cells. for example, tnf alpha  plays a central role in pro-inflammatory paracrine signaling and mediates the recruitment of cells involved in inflammatory and wound healing responses  <cit> . it was not clear to us why gene expression of biopsy  <dig> ni was similar to the healthy controls . a potential reason might be a reduced paracrine signaling at the location of biopsy.

compared to controls, mast cell counts were 6- to 8-fold higher in the detrusor muscle of classic ic, and 2- to 3-fold higher in non-ulcerative ic  <cit> .

several reviews attribute a key role to mast cells in the mediation of chronic inflammation. signals released from abnormal urothelium or penetrating through a damaged urothelium may stimulate submucosal sensory nerves, and recruit and activate inflammatory leukocytes including mast cells. upon activation, mast cells release preformed mediators stored in granules , generate mediators by enzymatic processing of membrane phospholipids , and produce cytokines and chemokines de novo . released mediators initiate and maintain the recruitment of inflammatory cells, promote angiogenesis and stimulate fibrosis  <cit> .

upon histological analysis, mastocytosis in the deeper areas of the bladder wall was found in all of our classic ic patients. the concept outlined above describing the central role of mast cells in inflammation may explain many of our findings. upon cystoscopy and bladder filling, the bladder wall was found to be very fragile at many points, not only at the sites of hunner's ulcers .

CONCLUSIONS
genechip expression arrays with total-rna isolated from bladder biopsies provided molecular insights into ulcerative ic. the comparison of ic patients with healthy controls revealed approximately  <dig>  genes with an ic-to-healthy expression ratio greater than two. most differences in gene expression are not due to induction or repression of individual genes, as is observed by stimulation of cell cultures in vitro, but are rather a consequence of leukocyte infiltration. the predominant process of ulcerative ic is an extensive immune response. b-cell commitment and the production of antibodies appear to be striking features, and most likely distinguish this chronic sterile cystitis from an acute infectious cystitis. previous histopathology data have shown that leukocyte infiltration was common in ulcerative ic. our data clearly confirm these findings, and, additionally, provide us with a pattern of potential molecular markers characterizing this subtype of ic. future studies analyzing bladder biopsies of patients with similar symptoms, but not having ulcerative ic, will be needed. this would include the comparison of our ulcerative ic data with data from patients having non-ulcerative ic, urinary tract infection, bladder cancer, urinary tract stones or chemical/radiation cystitis. the assemblage and evaluation of such data would provide us with molecular information for a differential diagnosis of ic and other bladder diseases.
