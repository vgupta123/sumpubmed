BACKGROUND
stereoselective carbonyl reductases  are nicotinamide cofactor-dependent enzymes capable of catalyzing the reversible redox reaction between alcohols and aldehydes/ketones. during the past decade, scrs have been considerably applied to the synthesis of chiral pharmaceutical intermediates, including anticholesterol drugs  <cit> , β-lactams antibiotics  <cit> , anticancer drugs  <cit> , and other important drugs  <cit> . however, the scale-up of scr-catalyzed reactions were restricted due to the limited commercially available scrs, narrow substrate specificity, expensive cofactor dependency, and substrate insolubility.

ethyl -4-chloro-3-hydroxybutyrate -chbe) is a versatile precursor for pharmacologically valuable products, such as l-carnitine  <cit> , -4-amino-3-hydroxybutyric acid   <cit> , and -4-hydroxy-pyrrolidone  <cit> . several synthetic strategies for optically active chbe were developed, wherein the enzymatic asymmetric synthesis is the most promising way. although various biocatalysts have been found to give -chbe , -isomer is in great demand yet less attainable. since then, several microorganisms and enzymes capable of converting ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate  to -chbe have been documented, including gox <dig> from gluconobacter oxydans  <cit> , akrs from sporobolomyces salmonicolor and lodderomyces elongisporus , and a reductase from bacillus sp. ecu <dig>  <cit> . however, all of them suffer from impediment such as low substrate concentration, unsatisfactory stereoselectivity, or high substrate/catalyst  ratio. these shortcomings hindered their applications in the industrial synthesis of -chbe. exploring more robust scrs with the ability to prepare enantioenriched -chbe efficiently is thus of great interest.

herein, we designed and implemented two strategies for identifying novel scrs, and constructed an enzyme toolbox to screen a robust scr that can biotransform cobe to -chbe. as the promising scr, bgadh <dig> from burkholderia gladioli cctcc m  <dig> was selected for further study. the substrate spectrum of bgadh <dig> was evaluated toward varied aryl ketones and ketoesters. furthermore, the practical applicability of bgadh <dig> was investigated in the asymmetric synthesis of -chbe using escherichia coli cells co-expressing bgadh <dig> and a glucose dehydrogenase . since the substrate was poorly soluble and unstable in aqueous environments, biphasic system was established using substrate fed-batch strategy to solve this issue. to our knowledge, this is the first report of scr from b. gladioli subjected to the asymmetric synthesis of enantioenriched -chbe in aqueous/octanol biphasic system.

RESULTS

strain b. gladioli cctcc m  <dig> isolated from soil samples exhibited activity for catalyzing cobe to -chbe . genome hunting and data mining strategies were selected to discovering robust scrs from cctcc m  <dig>  based on bioinformatics analysis of sequence-similarity with gox <dig>  <cit> , which is a known nadh-dependent scr giving enantiopure -chbe.  <dig> candidates were cloned or synthesized, and heterologously overexpressed in e. coli bl <dig> , wherein bgadh <dig> displayed high activity toward cobe and afforded -chbe . sequence analysis indicated that the bgadh <dig> gene contained an open reading frame with 1011 bp encoding a  <dig> amino-acid protein, in which the conserved nadp-binding motiff t97g98xxxg102xg <dig> and key catalytic residues n202s228y241k <dig> were found . the recombinant bgadh <dig> with his6-tag mainly presented in the soluble fraction was purified through nickel chelating affinity chromatography  <cit> . as shown in fig.  <dig>  the bgadh <dig> was not homogeneous, and the estimated molecular mass was around 37 kda, in accordance with its theoretical value . the molecular mass of native bgadh <dig> determined on the discovery bio gfc  <dig> column suggested that the quaternary structure of bgadh <dig> was dimer.fig.  <dig> sds-page analysis of bgadh <dig>  lane  <dig>  molecular mass standard; lane  <dig>  e. coli bl <dig> /pet28b-bgadh <dig> without iptg induction; lane  <dig>  crude extract; lane  <dig>  soluble fraction; lane  <dig>  purified bgadh3




biochemical characterization of bgadh3
to investigate the effect of ph on the activity and stability of bgadh <dig>  different ph values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  were tested. as a result, a bell-shaped ph profile was observed and the maximum activity was found at ph  <dig>  . remarkably, the recombinant bgadh <dig> is highly stable between ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  . the effect of temperature on bgadh <dig> activity was assessed by measuring activity at 25–65 °c. the optimum temperature occurred at 40 °c . thermostability of bgadh <dig> was evaluated at temperatures of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 65 °c, respectively. half-life time of 47 h was found at 45 °c. however, the enzyme was labile at higher temperatures  . the presence of ca2+, co2+, cu2+, fe3+, zn2+, and mg2+ slightly enhanced the activity of bgadh <dig>  whereas ag+ inhibited the activity of the enzyme with a loss of 75 % . when the metal-chelating agent edta-na <dig> was added, the residual activity of bgadh <dig> was maintained intact . cofactor preference of bgadh <dig> was evaluated using cobe as substrate and the result was given in table  <dig>  the purified bgadh <dig> displayed specific activities for the asymmetric reduction of cobe using both nadh and nadph as cofactors. although the k

effects of organic solvents
a series of hydrophobic solvents were selected to assess their effects on bgadh <dig> activity and histograms representing the residual activities were arrayed in accordance with the increasing log p values . bgadh <dig> activity was roughly correlated with the log p values of the corresponding solvents, except for dichloromethane, which strongly inhibited the enzyme activity. high activity was observed in the present of hydrophobic solvents with high log p value, such as octanol , cyclohexane , n-hexane , n-heptane , and iso-octane . similarly, the effect of the hydrophobicity of the solvents on the retention of bgadh <dig> stability was investigated. satisfactory results were obtained in the present of methyl tert-butyl ether , butyl acetate, octanol, iso-octane, and n-heptane, wherein the highest stability was observed in the presence of mtbe .fig.  <dig> effect of organic solvents on the activity and stability of recombinant bgadh <dig>  the activities were measured using cobe as substrate under the standard assay protocol. stability was determined by measuring the residual activities after incubation with organic solvents at 30 °c for 30 min. the activity in the absence of organic solvent was taken as control. thf, tetrahydrofuran; mtbe, methyl tert-butyl ether; ch2cl <dig>  dichloromethane

to screen an appropriate organic phase in the biphasic system for -chbe production by using co-expression strain e. coli/pcdfduet-1-bgadh3-gdh, n-butanol, tert-amylalcohol, mtbe, butyl acetate, toluene, and octanol were selected to evaluate the effects on product yield and ee. the result was presented in table  <dig>  all yields of aqueous-organic solvents systems were below 50 % or less, except for octanol, in which a yield of  <dig>  % was obtained. it was noteworthy that reduction of cobe was strongly inhibited in butyl acetate, affording too low yield . interestingly, the enantioselectivity was not impaired and maintained >99 % ee in the presence of all the tested organic solvents.table  <dig> screening of organic solvents for biosynthesis of -chbe

optimization of reaction conditions
to improve the asymmetric reduction of cobe to -chbe by using co-expression e. coli, different reaction conditions were further investigated. as shown in fig. 5a, it was found that the yield of -chbe was significantly improved when the glucose/cobe  ratio was increased to  <dig>  and then was clearly diminished when the ratio was over  <dig>  to effectively synthesize -chbe, the amount of nadp+ was also optimized. the highest yield was obtained using a nadp+/cobe  ratio of  <dig>  and a huge excess of nadp+ was not necessary . the maximum level of yield was found at 30 °c and ph  <dig>  . an increased production of -chbe was observed as the cell dosage was raised from  <dig>  to  <dig>  g dcw. when the cell dosage was excess  <dig>  g dcw, the yield of -chbe was not increased significantly . keeping constant the s/c  ratio of  <dig>  different amount of cobe were further estimated. the yield of -chbe was significantly decreased when more than 24 mmol of the substrate was added . based on the above results, the optimum reaction conditions in 20 ml system were obtained: cobe 24 mmol, glucose 72 mmol, nadp+ 24 μmol, cell dosage  <dig>  g dcw, ph  <dig> , and 30 °c.fig.  <dig> effects of glucose concentrations , nadp+ concentrations , temperature , ph , cell dosage , and substrate loading  on the biosynthesis of -chbe using co-expression e. coli cells

discussion
during the past decade, the efficiency of asymmetrically biocatalytic synthesis catalyzed by scrs has emerged as an environmentally sustainably alternative to traditional organo- and metallocatalysis due to the inherent high stereoselectivity of the biocatalysts and the mild reaction conditions. however, there are still impeded in their large-scale application due to the limited commercially robust biocatalysts, the narrow substrate specificity and the dependency of expensive cofactor as well as the water-insoluble substrates  <cit> . with the development of genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics, genome hunting and data mining have become powerful tools for exploiting novel enzymes  <cit> . in the present study, on the basis of screening results of microorganisms, and the combination of the blastp searching using the reported carbonyl reductase , a toolbox contained  <dig> candidates predicted as carbonyl reductases was successfully constructed, and further subjected to the asymmetric synthesis of enantioenriched -chbe.

optically active -chbe is a useful chiral building block for l-carnitine, a biomolecule capable of modulating the serum oxidation stress and lipid profile  <cit> , and is synthesized through the asymmetrical reduction of cobe. a scr from g. oxydans 621h was reported to provide for accessing -chbe, but with low substrate concentration   <cit> . using an akr from s. salmonicolor, as much as 268 g l− <dig> of cobe was converted to -chbe yet with moderate enantioselectivity   <cit> . a reductase from bacillus sp. ecu <dig> was capable of producing -chbe with high substrate loading  and enantioselectivity , however, it required high s/c and only small-scale was accomplished  <cit> . in this study, a robust scr designed as bgadh <dig>  from b. gladioli cctcc m  <dig> demonstrated high catalytic efficiency and excellent enantioselectivity thus was considered as a promising scr for the asymmetric synthesis of optically active -chbe, accomplishing an economic and environmental balance.

considering the majority of pairwise similarities between scr members are in the range of 15–30 %, and the presence of conserved nadp-binding motiff tgxxxgxg as well as n-s-y-k catalytic terads  <cit> , bgadh <dig> was defined as the ‘classical’ short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases . although the well-known lactobacillus brevis sdr exhibited strong mg2+ dependency  <cit> , sdrs generally does not require metal ions. in this case, the metal chelator edta did not impact the activity, and most of the tested metal ions did not significantly improved bgadh <dig> activity, revealing that bgadh <dig> is typical of non-metal sdr. several scrs have been described capable of oxidizing both nadh and nadph in the asymmetric reduction  <cit> . in this study, cofactor preference of bgadh <dig> was evaluated using cobe as substrate, indicating that bgadh <dig> was not completely specific to nadh or nadph as well. due to the higher catalytic efficiency, nadph was selected as the cofactor in the reduction of cobe using bgadh <dig>  notably, the catalytic ability of bgadh <dig> was approximately 5-fold improvement compared to that found on the literature for gox <dig>  an nadh-dependent sdr provided access to -chbe  <cit> .

enzymes generally require aqueous media in which the hydrophobic substrates are poorly soluble and even unstable. a straightforward solution to this issue might be the application of an aqueous organic solvent system  <cit> . there are several documented cases in which organic solvents can affect the enzymatic activity . compared to hydrophobic solvents, hydrophilic ones are usually easier impact the activity due to the greater tendency of stripping tightly bound water in the enzyme molecules  <cit> . herein, batteries of water-immiscible solvents were tested for the influence on the activity of bgadh <dig>  high activity observed in the presence of hydrophobic solvents with high log p value was consistent with the recent study of organic tolerance of alcohol dehydrogenases  <cit> . in contrast, the stability of bgadh <dig> showed no dependence on the hydrophobicity of solvents. this finding is in agreement with the assumption that solvent functionality is also significance for enzyme deactivation  <cit> . thus, it was established that log p was not an adequate parameter to describe the trend of enzyme tolerance to organic solvents. although bgadh <dig> exhibited high activity and stability in the presence of cyclohexane, n-hexane, n-heptane, and iso-octane, cobe and -chbe exhibited low solubility due to the poor partition coefficient thus were not suitable for the application in aqueous organic solvent system. butyl acetate has been frequently introduced as the non-aqueous phase in the reduction of cobe  <cit> , however, bgadh <dig> was strongly inactivated in this solvent. in this case, octanol was eventually chosen as the organic phase in the biphasic system.

different position and size of the substituents in carbonyl compounds play an critical role in the enzyme activity  <cit> . with regard to acetophenone derivatives, the ortho-substituted group  or multi-substitution  reduced the bgadh <dig> activity due to the steric hindrance effects on the hydrogen attack from nadph to the carbonyl group. likewise, the bulky substituents in ketoesters adjacent to the carbonyl group also have negative effects. bgadh <dig> generally obeys prelog’s rule with s preference by the hydride transfer from the cofactor to the re-face of the carbonyl group during the enzymatic reductions, similar to the majority of known scrs  <cit> . the inverted stereochemical assignment observed toward 12– <dig> and  <dig> was explained by a higher cahn-ingold-prelog priority in the smaller side of substrate than the large one, thus still followed the prelog’s rule of hydride delivery. however, the reduction of  <dig> catalyzed by bgadh <dig> also afforded the -enantiomer, suggesting that bulky substituent might affect the configuration of the corresponding alcohol.

although the upscale application of scrs was impeded by the requirement for expensive cofactors such as nad+/nadh, enzyme-coupled and substrate-coupled cofactor recycling strategies have been developed for surmounting this challenge . compared to the substrate-coupled cofactor recycling with reversibility and poor thermodynamic driving force, enzyme-coupled cofactor regeneration exhibited more efficient and inexpensive. in this study, gdh from exiguobacterium sibiricum 255– <dig>  and glucose was successfully coupled with bgadh <dig> in the biosynthesis of -chbe. expressing scr and gdh in same cell is the possibility to avoid using an additional expensive cofactor when performing the biotransformation with high substrate loading . herein, the bgadh <dig> and gdh genes were introduced into the pcdfduet- <dig> vector to construct the co-expressed plasmid pcdfduet-1-bgadh3-gdh and strain e. coli/pcdfduet-1-bgadh3-gdh. the yield was enhanced approximately 17 % in the presence of  <dig>  μmol nadp+/ or more compared to that in the absence of external nadp+, likely because the amount of cofactor in vivo is insufficient to this reaction. based on cost considerations, the ratio of nadp+/cobe  was limited to  <dig> . reaction ph and temperature play important roles in biotransformation, which can significantly affect the activity and stability of biocatalysts, the speed of substrate molecules motion, and the activation energy of the bioreduction. the optimum temperature of co-expressed e. coli was inconsistent with that of single bgadh <dig>  this might be explained that the high temperature impact the gdh activity before affect the bgadh <dig> activity. the substrate loading was considerably improved with the increased of cell dosage at a fixed s/c  of  <dig>  while the yield was significantly reduced when the cell dosage was too high due to the increased viscosity in the reaction media which might be hinder the molecular transfer between substrate and enzyme  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a preparative-scale highly stereoselective reduction of cobe to -chbe by using a newly cloned bgadh <dig> co-expressed with gdh. from a practical viewpoint, this asymmetric synthesis of -chbe is promising since no example reported to produce -chbe with more than 1200 mmol of in 1-l reaction system yet .table  <dig> comparison of several reported biocatalysts for producing -chbe





CONCLUSIONS
in summary, a scr toolbox was constructed in this work through genome hunting and data mining approaches based on bioinformatics analysis of sequence-similarity with known stereoselective scr, and further subjected to the asymmetric synthesis of -chbe. the newly cloned bgadh <dig> from b. gladioli displayed high activity and excellent enantioselectivity toward cobe, and served as a versatile scr with a broad substrate spectrum converting varied aromatic ketones and ketoesters to the corresponding chiral alcohols with excellent enantiomeric purity . furthermore, asymmetric synthesis of -chbe was developed by using recombinant e. coli cells co-expressing bgadh <dig> and gdh. using substrate fed-batch mode and aqueous/octanol biphasic system, the decomposition of cobe and its inhibition of the biocatalyst were significantly alleviated. using the “designer cells”, -chbe was produced at a high space-time yield per gram of biomass of  <dig>  mmol∙l−1∙h−1∙g dcw− <dig> and excellent enantiopurity  with the highest substrate total loading of 1200 mmol in 1-l reaction system reported so far. this study allows for the further application of bgadh <dig> in the biosynthesis of chiral alcohols, and establishes a preparative scale process for producing -chbe with excellent enantiopurity.
