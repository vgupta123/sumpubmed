BACKGROUND
plants produce a diverse and dynamic population of small rnas  that are involved in transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing and directing dna methylation  <cit> . distinct sub-populations of srnas have been identified and experimental evidence derived from arabidopsis thaliana mutants has shown that each sub-population is derived via distinct biogenesis routes: micrornas  are produced via the action of the dicer-like rnaseiii-type ribonuclease dcl <dig> and are cleaved from precursor near-perfect stem-loop hairpins formed from rna polymerase ii transcripts;  <dig> nucleotide  endogenous short-interfering rnas  derive from long, double-stranded rnas  and are produced via the action of an rna-dependent rna  polymerase; trans-acting sirnas  are produced primarily by rdr <dig> together with sgs <dig> and dcl <dig>  which yield phased  <dig> nt sirnas;  <dig> nt heterochromatic sirnas are produced by the action of the dna-dependent rna polymerase poliv, rdr <dig> and dcl <dig>  <cit> . work in a. thaliana has made extensive use of high throughput sequencing in combination with srna silencing mutants to elucidate the roles of genes within the different biogenesis pathways for srna classes  <cit> .

the genus populus is now firmly established as the model system for forest trees  <cit> . populus represents an excellent model, being suitable for studies focusing on commercial traits, such as biomass-yield and wood fibre qualities, as well as association mapping and ecological interaction studies. as seasonal, hard-wood perennials with an extended juvenile phase, populus species undergo a number of processes that could be expected to involve some degree of epigenetic control and re-programming. as such populus represents an ideal system in which to further understanding of traits such as seasonal senescence, dormancy/growth-arrest and juvenile to adult phase transition. populus is also nearly exclusively dioecious, yet currently the mechanism determining gender is unknown. an increasingly compelling body of evidence exists to suggest that chromosome  <dig> may be in the process of becoming a zw style sex chromosome  <cit> , with the female potentially being the heterogametic sex  <cit> , although this is certainly not clear  <cit> . again this is a trait that could involve an epigenetic component. as long-lived, clonally-replicating species, poplars and aspens also represent an excellent opportunity to identify how such long-lived species may have evolved particular means to survive both abiotic and biotic stresses. particularly in the case of biotic factors, long-lived species face the challenge of surviving repeated attacks from antagonists with short generation times which are therefore capable of more rapid evolutionary change. indeed the molecular clock of poplar ticks considerably more slowly than that of arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> .

populus has so far not been exhaustively profiled for srnas, especially when compared to a. thaliana where there have now been a number of high-throughput sequencing studies performed  <cit>  and where an excellent web resource exists for viewing the available datasets  <cit> . previous work in populus has either consisted of in silico studies or has been performed to a lower sequencing depth and has concentrated only on the identification of mirnas  <cit> . to date, none have described the genomic distribution of other classes of srnas in populus, despite those representing the majority of srnas produced.

we sequenced srnas in the sequenced p. trichocarpa genotype  using a concatenation approach in combination with massively parallel pyrosequencing . using an established analysis pipeline that draws on the accumulated knowledge gained from analysing srna data in a. thaliana  <cit> , we characterised srnas in young leaf material and in particular we concentrated on describing the genomic distribution and context of loci producing numerous srnas as well as identifying predicted trans-acting sirna and mirna loci.

RESULTS
sequencing of srna using a concatenation strategy
massively parallel sequencing has provided a technological platform to investigate transcripts far more deeply than was previously possible. as sequencing read lengths increase, slightly modified methods can increase throughput several fold. here we applied a concatenation strategy as outlined in figure 1a. after cdna synthesis and polymerase chain reaction  amplification, a concatenation step was carried out. concatenated amplicons were sequenced using  <dig> pyrosequencing  <cit> . after this step about half of the number of reads corresponded to single srna, 33% to two srnas, 15% to three srnas and only a minor fraction  to four srnas . in total, this strategy yielded  <dig>  small rna reads from  <dig>  sequencing reads, representing a 65% increase in throughput. to investigate whether this approach changed measured srna expression levels, we also performed a small-scale experiment using a sub-region of a  <dig> picotiter plate. comparison of measured raw read counts between the concatenated and non-concatenated libraries showed a pearson's correlation coefficient of  <dig> , indicating that no major changes were introduced using this approach . with several platforms now reaching read lengths of  <dig> bases or more, concatenation of cdna prior to sequencing is a valuable tool in small rna sequencing experiments for increasing throughput. one limiting step in our protocol is the blunt concatenation of double-stranded cdnas. it is possible that the ligation reaction can be improved by introducing a digestion step yielding fragments with protruding ends. ligation of these fragments could be performed in a similar manner, but likely giving a better yield of longer fragments. another step that can be introduced is gel purification to facilitate clean-up of fragments longer than, for example  <dig> base pairs, thereby increasing throughput.

analysis of the srna sequence data was performed using tools from the uea srna toolkit  <cit> . three filtering steps  were employed to extract a subset of sequences for further analysis. from the  <dig>  resultant srna sequences,  <dig>   passed all filters yielding  <dig>  unique sequences with a perfect-match to the p. trichocarpa genome . the largest loss of sequences occurred at the first filtering step  with many of these sequences likely representing partial degradation products of mrnas. filtering for low complexity is not expected to result in the loss of any mirnas as all a. thaliana and p. trichocarpa mirnas currently in mirbase  contain at least three different bases. however, some bona fide sirna may be removed, but these, if any, would represent a small minority. a significant percentage  of sequences passing the first two filters did not have a perfect match to the published genome sequence: the current populus genome sequence does not contain the centromeric regions, is a chimeric fusion of the two sequenced haplotypes and contains gaps. in particular, highly repetitive regions, which typically associate with srnas , are under-represented in the assembly. as such it is not unexpected that some bona fide sequences would not have perfect matches within the current genome assembly. future re-mapping of the dataset to updated genome assemblies may recover un-mapped reads. the majority of sequences with a read count above one were 24-mers and 21-mers . the group of  <dig> nt sequences were over-enriched for sequences beginning with a uracil  nucleotide when compared to all other size classes . although not significant, there was also a tendency for  <dig> nt sequences to start with an adenine  nucleotide. these two findings are similar to those found in a. thaliana  <cit>  and suggest that the same biogenesis mechanisms are operating in the two species, as is to be expected.

summary of redundant and non-redundant sequence counts after different filtering steps

comparison to previous populus studies
there have been three publications relating to srnas in populus, two of which used traditional sanger sequencing  <cit>  with the third using  <dig> pyrosequencing  <cit> . to allow direct comparison with our data we used the data from  <cit>   to re-create a redundant dataset for analysis using the uea plant srna toolkit. this resulted in  <dig>  unique sequences between 18- <dig> nt after filtering , of which  <dig> were perfect matches and  <dig> were overlapping with the  <dig>  unique sequence reads in our dataset.

one notable immediate difference between our dataset and that of  <cit>  is the frequency distribution of different srna size classes. we found that  <dig> nt srnas were the most abundant size class, with  <dig> nt srnas also being highly abundant . this is in agreement with previous reports in a. thaliana  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and physcomitrella patens  <cit> . in contrast, the results presented by  <cit>  showed clear dominance of  <dig> nt srnas with the second highest size class being  <dig> nts, followed by  <dig> nts. re-analysis using the same filtering criteria as for our data again revealed a clear dominance of  <dig> nt srnas, however  <dig> nt sequences were the second highest class followed by  <dig> nt . the reason for this difference may be that  <cit>  used a p. balsamifera clone whereas we used the same genetic clone as was used to produce the genome sequence, and the unusually high sequence variation within or between populus species complicates analysis  <cit> .

genomic context of srna distribution
since srnas often associate with repeats, it was of interest to analyse the distribution of srnas in relation to repeats in the populus genome. however, as compared to arabidopsis, repetitive element annotation in populus is less well developed. we performed a repeatmodeler and repeatmasker analysis of the populus genome sequence. the results from this analysis are available at popgenie  <cit> . for repeatmodeler-identified repeats the majority of srnas did not overlap a repeat and only ten repeats had overlap to > <dig> unique srna with none having > <dig> overlapping sequences. the maximum number of overlapping sequences was  <dig> for a repeat that overlaps two nbs-lrr disease resistance gene models. the srnas in this region showed a clear enrichment for  <dig> mers. within the repeatmasker data there was clear dominance of  <dig> nt srnas for those repeats with > <dig> overlapping srnas. there were also a number of cases where there was dominance of  <dig> nt srnas or near-equal representation of  <dig> and  <dig> nt srnas with these being overlaps to ltr retrotransposons. for example a repeat on scaffold_ <dig>  showed a majority of  <dig> nt sequences with substantial numbers of  <dig> nt sequences and few sequences from other size classes. such examples are potentially interesting considering the findings of  <cit>  where it was found that there is greater overlap of  <dig> nt srnas to ltr elements in maize than in arabidopsis. future work using biogenesis mutants will be needed to clarify whether  <dig> nt ltr-associated srnas in populus are more similar to the maize or the arabidopsis genomes.

in all other repeats there was clear dominance of  <dig> nt srnas with  <dig> nt srnas also having a significant representation. there were also substantial numbers of  <dig> nt srnas while other size classes were insignificant. in general, the repeatmasker data matched the results that have been reported in a. thaliana  <cit> .

repeatmasker was used to identify all populus and rosid repeats in repbase  <cit>  . repbase contains  <dig> lineage specific populus repeats and  <dig> rosid repeats . there are additionally  <dig> ancestral/ubiquitous repeats. there were extremely few examples of overlap to repeats within the rosids dataset with only  <dig> srnas overlapping currently annotated repbase repeats. three of these overlapped to a medicago line element and the remainder overlapped with eight annotated ltr elements, five of which were populus specific. the contrast between these overlap results and those of the repeatmodeler data strongly suggest that there is currently a paucity of public data relating to the repetitive elements in the populus genome.

to obtain a genomic overview of loci producing sirnas we used the uea plant srna toolkit siloco tool to identify loci producing significant numbers of sirnas . this analysis identified many of the predicted phased loci  and predicted and known mirnas. as well as identifying sirna clusters within the entire dataset, we used the siloco tool using only the  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt data subsets separately . in both cases we examined subsets of identified loci with the highest number of unique hits and the highest raw read count values. the nature of the loci identified was distinctly different between the two size classes: retrotransposons, and in particular ltr retrotransposons, accounted for the majority of  <dig> nt loci. in contrast the majority of  <dig> nt loci represented mirnas and predicted phased loci. one known mirna  was included in the  <dig> nt loci but in this case the  <dig> nt sequence originated within the mirna* region.

predicted phased and trans-acting loci with p < <dig> . where a locus targets many genes from a particular class, this is shown after the number of targets. the number of predicted targets at each locus is shown with the number of perfect-match sirna-targets indicated in parenthesis. target predictions were made using the psrnatarget web tool. 1these two loci are duplicates. 2manually corrected coordinates, as described in materials and methods. 3there is a second locus just adjacent to this  with p  <dig> , suggesting that the two may represent a single locus.

the genomic context of srnas was examined by identifying overlap to predicted gene models and repeats. the vast majority of srnas did not overlap gene-coding loci and most of those that did overlapped with < <dig> unique srnas. however, a small number of genes overlapped with a large numbers of srnas. for example, the two genes with the highest overlap to srnas were estext_genewise1_v <dig> c_ <dig>  and gw <dig> . <dig>  . nearly all of these overlapping srnas map anti-sense to the gene and in both cases there is a ribosomal dna -like repeat and an ltr retrotransposon within the gene coding sequence. in both cases there was near-equal distribution of srnas in all size classes  suggesting that these are not sirnas. in contrast other genes with high numbers of overlapping srnas showed clear enrichment for a particular size class. for example fgenesh4_pg.c_scaffold_ <dig> showed enrichment for  <dig> nt and to a lesser extent  <dig> nt srnas and eugene <dig>  for  <dig> nt srnas. there were also cases where there was near-equal distribution across size classes but with a peak at the smaller sizes . in these cases, all reads derived from the same strand as the gene and therefore likely represent degradation products of highly expressed genes. these two genes  encode psba, with all four having maximal homology to the arabidopsis gene atcg <dig>  which also shows a similar pattern of srna overlap. there were  <dig> genes with > <dig> unique overlapping srnas  and  <dig>  genes overlapped to at least a single mapped srnas. excluding those genes with > <dig> overlapping srnas, the majority of overlapping srnas were  <dig> mers. examination of the annotation of the  <dig> genes with > <dig> overlapping srnas did not reveal any functional over-representation of gene ontology categories or the presence of particular types of genes.

tas <dig> targets a subset of the arf  family
both  <cit>   and  <cit>  have previously shown conservation across a number of species for both the tas <dig> mir <dig> target sites and two trans-acting sirnas . tas <dig> targeting of a gene coding for an auxin response factor  is important for developmental timing and patterning in a. thaliana  <cit> . this is the only arabidopsis tas locus with even limited homology to populus as well as being the only a. thaliana tas with an exonerate alignment in the popgenie genome browser  <cit> . in the current study, the homologous region in populus produced primarily  <dig> nt sirnas  but was not one of the predicted phased loci. there were three to four dominant phasing peaks produced from the locus . it is likely that statistical significance for the ta-sirna prediction tool was not reached for this region due to inadequate sequencing depth, most likely resulting from the locus being weakly expressed: in the barakat et al. dataset  <cit> , only two sirnas from this locus were found. examination of the locus in the popgenie genome browser showed that there is a distinct, narrow peak of sequence conservation between a. thaliana and populus shown in the vista  <cit>  alignment plots that peaks at the position of the a. thaliana d <dig> tas3a sequence and remains high at the d <dig> sequence. there is complete conservation of the d <dig> and d <dig> sequences between arabidopsis and populus. the d <dig> sirna sequence has four perfect hits in the populus genome. vista alignment plots  show that there is a duplicated region on lg_viii . despite the high level of conservation between the duplicated regions, there does not appear to have been conservation of the sirna sequences themselves nor of the mir <dig> target sites. none of the other perfect hit locations appear to represent duplicated copies of this locus as only the d <dig> sequence is present at each. conservation of tas <dig> in rice was reported by  <cit> , suggesting early evolution and strong conservation of this locus. as was the case in rice, the most abundant sirna produced was not the conserved and functional sirna.

target prediction for the  <dig> nt sirnas from this locus identified four arf genes  suggesting that both target site and target are conserved. based on our own examination of the arf family, both arf <dig> and arf <dig> appear to be duplicated in populus, with arf <dig> existing as a single ortholog. in the case of arf <dig> we identified two additional predicted gene models  that lie within the same branch of the phylogenetic tree generated for the entire arf family  but they are truncated and lack the target recognition site for the tas3a tasirna. in the case of arf <dig>  one of the duplicates  contains three snps within the target site. as one of these snps is at the 11th base pair of the target sequence, it is quite probable that this copy of the gene is no longer targeted. the other copy  maintains complete homology to a. thaliana within the target site. it would be interesting to examine the functional role of this locus in populus, as in arabidopsis it has been shown to control vegetative phase transition  <cit> . this is a trait of particular interest in populus as the long juvenile phase represents a significant limitation to breeding programmes.  <cit>  examined the arf family in detail and identified six potential arf <dig> genes. however only two of these  were from the jamboree gene model set  and as a result the remaining four models that they predicted as arf <dig> genes were not included in the current analysis.

populus produces many phased sirnas
in a. thaliana, all tas loci identified to date produce phased  <dig> nt srnas, with the phase being set by mirna or sirna cleavage  <cit> . tas <dig> and tas <dig> transcripts are targeted by mir <dig>  tas <dig> by mir <dig> and tas <dig> by mir <dig>  while mir <dig> and mir <dig> are conserved in populus, there is no evidence of mir <dig> conservation.  <cit>  showed that there appears to be little evidence for the production of phased sirnas of other lengths in a. thaliana. the uea plant srna toolkit ta-sirna tool implements the algorithm from  <cit>  to identify potential tas/phased loci on the basis of such phasing. using a p value cut-off of  <dig>  ,  <dig> potential phased loci were identified containing between three and  <dig> phased sequences . in the case of the predicted phased locus on lg_x  we could extend the predicted phased locus beyond the region identified  by assuming that 'missing' sequences in relation to a predicted mirna target site were produced but not present in the current dataset. the production of potentially phased sirnas alone is, however, not enough to class a locus as trans-acting so we concentrated on the  <dig> predicted highly significant loci with p values < <dig>  and used the psrnatarget prediction tool  <cit>  to identify potential targets for phased sirnas . seven of these  <dig> loci were within predicted protein-coding regions, five are intergenic and one spans across the end of a predicted gene model. of the five loci located in intergenic regions, all but one overlapped to nbs-lrr repetitive elements and we therefore do not classify these as tas loci. to date, all eight of the confirmed a. thaliana tas loci  are produced from non protein-coding regions. phased loci within coding regions have also been reported but are not classed as trans-acting as they typically target in cis or target other members of the gene family from which they are produced  <cit> . using this criterion only the locus at lg_vi: <dig> . <dig>  would be classified as a tas locus.

among the identified loci are some interesting examples. on lg_ii , phased srnas are produced specifically from the exons of a predicted no apical meristem  gene  with a cluster of srnas being produced from both of the two exons and none from the intervening intron, suggesting that this locus is specific to the transcribed rna. the loci on lg_iii and scaffold_ <dig> contain phased sirnas that do not have unique hits within the genome. in the case of the three loci on lg_iii, all three are homologous and contain largely the same set of sirnas. from the current study it is not possible to determine whether all three loci actually produce sirnas. in the case of the locus on scaffold_ <dig> there are numerous genomic hits for each sirna.

 <cit>  found that populus ppr-p genes were predicted to be targeted singularly or dually by either mir <dig> or mir <dig>  our data show that populus ppr-p loci do produce sirnas, with a subset producing phased sirnas. however, the gene presented in figure  <dig> of  <cit>   contains targets sites for both mir <dig> and mir <dig> but did not produce sirnas in the current study or in that of  <cit> . the a. thaliana tas <dig> and tas <dig> loci specifically target ppr genes but there is no evidence of homology between these loci and the ones identified in this study. therefore it would seem that similar evolutionary mechanisms have been deployed to silence the same gene families in both species. previously mir <dig> and mir <dig> predictions were based on the considerably smaller datasets of  <cit>  and had not been well characterised.

we found that particularly mir <dig> has strong sequence support as a bona fide mirna. the stem-loop structure and srna read distribution for the four mir <dig> and three mir <dig> loci can been found in additional file  <dig> and  <dig> respectively.

the phased locus on lg_vi generates sirnas that are predicted to target the myb transcription factor gene from which they are generated. expression of the sirnas was low within the sample we sequenced and it is therefore hard to predict whether such a potential loop of transcriptional regulation has functional significance. tas <dig> in a. thaliana specifically targets myb transcription factors  <cit>  however there is no apparent significant homology between the tas <dig> locus and the populus locus identified here. however, it is interesting that phasing of tas <dig> is set by mir <dig> and that there is a mir <dig> target site in phase with the locus we have identified.

we also performed a search for predicted genomic target sites of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> , and mir <dig> to examine whether any predicted targets matched the location of identified phased loci. we included mir <dig>  because it potentially sets the phase of the locus identified on lg_x: <dig> . <dig> . however, this did not yield any additional loci producing srnas.

chromosome xix contains a srna hotspot
the genomic distribution of srnas was examined by plotting read counts for each srna size class within  <dig>  mb windows across the entire genome. as has been observed in a. thaliana  <cit> , the location of srnas was not evenly distributed across the genome or along chromosomes. three of the  <dig> chromosomes are shown as examples in figure  <dig> . in general there was a low-level background production of  <dig> nt srnas with the background punctuated by regions of significantly higher production. in the majority of cases, increased srna expression was enriched for a particular size class; for example, about half way along lg_x and 1/3rd along lg_vii there were distinct  <dig> nt peaks. in the majority of cases, these peaks represent highly-expressed mirnas. there were also regions that produced high numbers of a combination of size classes, for example towards the end of lg_i there was a distinct peak enriched for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nt srnas. specific regions of chromosomes had considerably higher srna production compared to the genome-wide background. in particular, the first third of lg_xix produced significantly greater numbers of srnas than did the remainder of the chromosome and the rest of the genome. interestingly, this is the same region proposed to be in the process of developing characteristics associated with a sex chromosome  <cit>  and that also has reduced recombination and enrichment of nbs-lrr disease resistance genes  <cit> .

using the findings presented in  <cit> , we examined this region in greater detail. the available genome sequence for the heterozygous p. trichocarpa female represents only one haplotype at each location, with each chromosome sequence representing a chimeric combination of scaffolds from both haplotypes. for the peritelomeric region of lg_xix, the alternative haplotype is represented by scaffold_ <dig>  <cit> , a fact that can be confirmed by examining the presence of the mapped genetic markers orpm  <dig> and orpm  <dig> . the two haplotypes for this region are highly divergent, with contrasting gene content  <cit> . of the genes that are in common between the two haplotypes, the vast majority are nbs-lrr genes. here we show that only the haplotype represented in lg_xix contains the identified hotspot for srna production, with srna production being minimal for scaffold_ <dig> . the phased locus identified on lg_xix is also specific to this haplotype. target predictions for the phased sirnas and for other srnas that had unique alignments to this region of lg_xix showed almost exclusive targeting of nbs-lrr genes. of genes targeted by non-phased srnas and located on linkage groups ,  <dig> of  <dig> genes were located on lg_xix,  <dig> of which are located within the first  <dig> mb of the linkage group and all of which are nbs-lrr genes. although the majority of genes shared between the two haplotypes for this region are nbs-lrr genes, no target sites were identified for genes on scaffold_ <dig> and examination of paralog data at popgenie suggests that the targeted genes are not those with high similarity to genes on scaffold_ <dig>  the notable over-represented production of srnas from this region in both the  <dig> and  <dig> nt size classes and the pattern of nbs-lrr gene targeting leaves open the possibility that srnas and nbs-lrr genes within this region have a role to play in sex determination or the maintenance of reduced recombination. the observed haplotypic divergence for these features is certainly intriguing.

prediction of novel non-conserved mirnas
comparison of all sirna reads to viridiplantae mature mirna sequences in mirbase  identified matches to  <dig> mirna families . the number of matching families increased to  <dig> when matches were searched for in the mirna precursor sequences. there are currently  <dig> populus mirna families in mirbase. perfect matches to  <dig> of these were identified when matching to precursor sequences and  <dig> when matching to mature mirnas. matching to precursor sequences was performed as we noticed a number of cases where we sequenced a high copy number  <dig> nt sequence that was predicted as a mirna but did not match the current mirbase mature mirna entries. as an example, we identified a sequence matching ptc-mir <dig> with an expression count of one. at the corresponding genomic locus a mirna was predicted within our dataset but with the mirna and mirna* sequences reversed compared to the current mirbase entry. in our dataset, the mirna* had a read count of  <dig>  a mirna corresponding to the current mirbase entry was predicted in  <cit> , in which no mirna* sequence was found. this suggests that the two sequences may be under differential control.

sequences matching the mature mirna sequence of two conserved families  that do not currently have populus mirbase entries were found with sequence counts of  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. neither of the regions where these sequences map to were predicted as mirnas within our dataset. the sequence matching mir <dig> has  <dig> perfect hits within the genome and two hits containing two mismatches. the majority of these hits are within ltr retrotransposons  and none of the locations has evidence of a mirna* sequence. this makes it unlikely that any of the loci represent an actual mirna, although there is still the potential that the generated srna could serve a targeting function. the sequences matching mir <dig> have two perfect hits within the genome. the matching sequence was also present at a high sequence count  in the data of  <cit> , however no potential mirna* sequence was found in either dataset. neither locus produces a convincing hairpin structure, making it unlikely that these are actual mirnas, despite the perfect homology to mature mirna sequences in other plant species. further work is needed to determine whether these loci produce sirnas that result in target cleavage.

the uea plant srna toolkit mircat tool identified  <dig> potential mirnas . in a. thaliana, mircat has been shown to have >90% sensitivity for detecting known mirnas and to have a specificity of >99%  <cit>  when applied to the comparable dataset of  <cit> . target predictions were run for all predicted mirnas. all predicted mirnas matching existing mirbase entries had predicted targets. predicted mirnas matched  <dig> of the  <dig> populus mirnas currently in mirbase, with members from  <dig> of the  <dig> families included. of the remaining sequences,  <dig> had no predicted targets and  <dig> had predicted targets. none of the predicted mirnas without predicted targets appear to be conserved. functional enrichment for gene ontology  biological process categories was carried out for all predicted targets of existing mirbase mirnas and for all novel predicted mirnas from this study. in both cases there was dramatic and nearly exclusive over-representation of processes associated with development and pattern formation/specification.

although all of the predicted mirnas fulfil the requirements of expression and foldback, the need for stringent annotation criteria has become increasingly evident.  <cit>  argue that small rnas that derive from regions apparently able to form hairpins could very well represent false-positives, and that further evidence such as dcl <dig> dependency or detection of a mirna* is required to classify a locus as a bona fide mirna  <cit> . since we do not have data on dcl <dig> dependency, we used the presence of a mirna* sequence as a classification criterion. however, for predicted mirnas matching existing mirbase entries only  <dig> of  <dig> sequences  had a mirna* sequence present in our dataset and the majority of current mirbase entries have no mirna* support.

for novel predicted mirnas with predicted targets,  <dig> of  <dig> sequences  had a mirna* sequence , and  <dig> of  <dig> sequences  with no predicted targets had a mirna* sequence. details of all predicted mirnas are given in additional file  <dig> and all secondary structures in additional file  <dig> 

novel predicted mirna loci with an identified mirna* sequence and a minimum mirna read count of  <dig>  as identified using the uea plant srna toolkit mircat tool. 1overlaps an aligned est. 2overlaps a repeat. 3predicted in  <cit> . ashows no homology to existing plant mirnas.

within the three classes of data  there were distinctly different sequence length frequencies. the vast majority  of sequences matching mirbase entries were  <dig> mers. for novel mirnas with predicted targets, the largest size class was  <dig> mers , however a notable percentage of  <dig> mers  and  <dig> mers  were included. for sequences with no predicted targets, there was clear over-representation of  <dig> mers , with  <dig> mers being the only other notable size group . there were also differences in the frequency of sequences starting with a u, which is characteristic of the majority of mirnas in a. thaliana  <cit> . for the three classes of predicted mirnas the percentage of sequences starting with an a, u, c or g respectively was: matching mirbase  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  1; not-matching, with targets  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  8; not-matching, no targets  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> . in all three cases the majority of sequences begin with a u, however the distribution is clearly far more biased towards u in those sequences matching current mirbase entries. it was also the case that most cases not matching mirbase but having an identified mirna* started with a u. despite caveats, at least some of the predicted mirnas will represent non-conserved, young mirnas but are certainly expressed at low levels and would require considerably increased depth of coverage in order to locate a mirna* sequence for which a lack of predicted targets is not unexpected  <cit> .

we examined the three novel predicted mirnas with the highest sequence counts in more detail . many of the scaffolds within the current genome assembly are likely to represent haplotypes rather than unassembled sequences. this is particularly true of the shorter scaffolds. vista alignment results suggest that the two loci represented in figure 4c-d lie within duplicated regions, or a least regions that are highly similar and syntenic and figure 4g shows that they have highly conserved hairpin sequences.

further work will be needed to clarify whether scaffold_ <dig> represents the other haplotype of the relevant region of lg_xii. equally, the two mir <dig> loci represented in figure 4a-b likely represents paralogs and have highly similar hairpin sequences .

it is likely that several novel mirna candidates remain to be found in populus, and deeper sequencing of small rna libraries from additional tissues, in particular flowers, and conditions is needed. it would, for example, be interesting to sample material before and after the juvenile phase transition. the small number of novel non-conserved mirnas identified in combination with the evidence that we obtained considerably greater depth of coverage of the small rna population than previous work suggests that greater depth will now be required to identify mirnas with moderate to low abundance due to the requirement for a sequenced mirna*. sequencing srnas from additional tissues and conditions will also help clarify which of the current mirbase ptc-mirnas can be experimentally confirmed. as was also reported to be the case in rice  <cit> , many of the current populus mirnas in mirbase lack any experimental evidence and at least some of the predicted mirnas more likely represent sirnas.

a novel locus may encode dual mirnas
an additional  <dig> nt locus  that lies within a tandemly-duplicated repeat was located very close to a cluster of unique-hit  <dig> nt sirnas, one of which has an expression count > <dig>  and for which the siloco tool identified a  <dig> nt loci . figure 5b shows the hairpin structure for this region and the position of sequenced sirnas along the hairpin. evidence for a dual production from transposable elements has been previously reported  <cit>  and production of  <dig> nt srnas from hairpin-like structures has been observed in a. thaliana  <cit> , where it was suggested that these may represent recently evolved, or still evolving, mirnas. the potential mature mirna sequence shows no similarity to any current entries in mirbase and none of the sequences lie in regions showing evidence of cross-species conservation . the potential  <dig> nt mirna had a detectable mirna* sequence  and there was also a potential mirna* for the most highly-expressed  <dig> nt srna. several variants that differ by one base on either side of this sequence were also highly expressed. it is possible that this hairpin produces two mature mirnas through different cleavage reactions, or that the  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt sequences represent different classes of srnas. the hairpin structure for this genomic region results from the high degree of complementarity between a pair of annotated repeats . the  <dig> nt potential mirna has two predicted nbs-lrr targets, both of which are on scaffold_ <dig> . viewing the exonerate alignments of populus proteins for the gene model available at popgenie showed that none of the aligned paralogous sequences contain repeats in the same exon and correspondingly none contain any mapped srnas.

mirna targeting in duplicated genes
since the populus genome has undergone a relatively recent whole-genome duplication, we were interested in how many pairs of duplicated genes had retained mirna targeting in both copies. using psrnatarget predictions of mirna targeting for all mirbase mirnas  in combination with data made available on the jgi populus genome ftp site  <cit> , an analysis of recent duplicated genes was used to identify those duplets  where only one of the two copies is predicted to be targeted by a mirna. across all of the  <dig>  predicted populus gene models,  <dig>  were predicted to be targeted by a mirna. the duplicated dataset contains  <dig>  duplicated gene pairs of which the vast majority  are not predicted to be targeted by mirnas. of the  <dig> duplets remaining  there were  <dig> where both duplets are predicted to be targeted by mirnas and  <dig> where only one of the two duplet copies is targeted. alignments of these showed that six duplets lost target predictions due to gene models being highly truncated compared to the other copy with the target site entirely missing. there were snps or single base pair insertions in seven cases but none of these were at the 10th or 11th position and so target predictions were lost because the threshold score we set  was not met. in these cases it is not clear whether the duplet would still be targeted or not. there was one example of an insertion and one of a deletion that did affect the 10th and 11th position of the target site, which would almost certainly result in a loss of mirna binding.

CONCLUSIONS
we profiled the srna population in populus to a depth far exceeding previous efforts. this allowed identification of novel, non-conserved mirna loci, phased sirnas and characterisation of the genomic distribution of srnas. we identified a region of lg_xix overlapping the sex determination region and a major cluster nbs-lrr genes as a hot-spot for srna production whether or not srnas are more important regulators of developmental transitions in long-lived species such as populus compared to annual species remains to be established.
