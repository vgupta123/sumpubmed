BACKGROUND
bovine viral diarrhea virus  is an important cause of respiratory, enteric, and reproductive disease in cattle and has been associated with major economic losses in cattle operations worldwide  <cit> . vaccination of young calves against bvdv reduces the number of acute infections in the herd and limits spread of virus among cattle populations  <cit> ; however, effective vaccination of young calves against bvdv can be challenging due to the presence of maternally-derived bvdv antibodies at the time of vaccination  <cit> . although maternally-derived bvdv antibodies can provide protection against acute bvdv infection and clinical disease, humoral immune responses to vaccination might be adversely affected  <cit> . concentration of maternally-derived bvdv antibodies and age of calf at the time of vaccination are important factors in the induction of adequate immune responses following bvdv immunization  <cit> . calves with moderate to high maternally-derived bvdv antibody levels at vaccination do not usually respond with an increase in bvdv antibodies but are protected against clinical disease, have a slower decay rate of maternal immunity, and develop anamnestic antibody responses following bvdv challenge  <cit> . calves with low maternally-derived bvdv antibody levels respond to vaccination by increasing bvdv antibody titers. the priming of naive b and t cells, the induction of specific cell mediated immune memory responses, and the induction of anamnestic antibody responses have been identified as the main source of protection of young calves vaccinated in the presence of maternally-derived antibodies and subsequently challenged with virulent bvdv  <cit> .

early weaned beef calves possess variable levels of maternally-derived bvdv antibodies at 2– <dig> months of age and therefore could benefit from vaccination prior to stress of weaning and shipment. a single dose of a multivalent, mlv bvdv vaccine was demonstrated to be effective in protecting young calves possessing different levels of maternal immunity against acute bvdv infection  <cit> . in addition to prevention of clinical disease, vaccination should limit the spread of bvdv by reducing virus shedding and horizontal transmission, a desirable outcome of vaccination in herds or units where populations of highly stressed cattle are commingled. however, experimental studies comparing different multivalent mlv vaccines containing bvdv in their ability to prevent viremia and viral shedding in young calves possessing maternally-derived immunity that subsequently undergo challenge with virulent bvdv are limited. the objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of three different commercially available, multivalent mlv vaccines containing bvdv to prevent clinical disease and reduce shedding of virus when administered to early weaned beef calves subsequently challenged with virulent bvdv  <dig> at  <dig> days after vaccination.

RESULTS
four groups of early weaned beef calves were vaccinated  or received phosphate saline  at weaning at a median calf age of  <dig>  days. the calves were born from cows that had been previously vaccinated at least once during the last 2 years with a mlv vaccine. the vaccine used in the cows during the previous 2 years was the same vaccine used in experimental calves from group d. forty five days after weaning calves were challenged with bvdv  <dig>  <dig>  evaluation of clinical responses to challenge and sample collection was performed from day  <dig>  until day  <dig> 

serum virus neutralization titers
thirty days prior to vaccination  and at a median calf age of 44 days, the mean levels of maternally-derived bvdv  <dig> nadl and bvdv  <dig> 125c serum antibodies were similar between groups . at vaccination , a significant effect of time  was detected  as decay of maternally-derived antibodies for bvdv  <dig> nadl and bvdv  <dig> 125c occurred in all groups; however, mean levels of bvdv  <dig> and bvdv  <dig> antibodies were not significantly different  between groups. forty-five days after vaccination, which corresponded to the time of bvdv  <dig> challenge , a significant effect of group and time  was detected . groups b and c calves had mean levels of serum bvdv  <dig> nadl antibodies significantly greater than controls . additionally, on day  <dig>  mean levels of bvdv  <dig> nadl antibodies were similar between group d and the control group . with respect to bvdv  <dig> 125c, group c calves had mean levels of antibodies significantly greater than the control group . twenty eight days following challenge, a significant effect of time  was detected  with respect to the levels of bvdv  <dig> 125c. the mean bvdv  <dig> 125c serum antibody levels increased similarly in all groups ; in contrast, time  and group effects were significant  for bvdv  <dig> nadl mean antibody levels as these were higher in group b and c calves compared to the control group . when antibodies to the challenge strain bvdv  <dig>  <dig> were examined at day  <dig>  a significant effect of group and time  was detected . calves from groups b and c had greater levels of antibodies compared with control calves . at day  <dig> after challenge, a significant  effect of time  was detected as all groups had increased and similar levels of antibodies to the challenge bvdv strain .table  <dig>

discussion
high levels of bvdv-specific antibodies from colostrum or vaccination effectively protect calves against severe clinical disease induced by challenge with virulent bvdv  <cit> ; however, prevention of viremia and virus shedding are variable in cattle vaccinated with mlv vaccines and subsequently challenged with virulent bvdv  <cit> . in the current study, calves from all groups had similar clinical scores and rectal temperatures, and mortality was not observed after challenge with virulent bvdv  <dig>  <dig>  this could be associated with protection offered by maternally-derived bvdv antibodies in vaccinated and unvaccinated calves as has been previously reported  <cit> , or could have resulted from lower virulence of the challenge virus than in previous reports  <cit> . pestiviruses constantly undergo genetic change due to the poor proof-reading capability of the rna-dependent rna polymerase, resulting in variability of phenotypic characteristics such as host-cell tropism and virulence  <cit> . repeated passage in cell culture was previously reported to result in attenuation of a bvdv isolate, and may have occurred with the bvdv  <dig> used in this study  <cit> .

interestingly, only calves from group d had an increased white blood cell count compared with control calves at day  <dig> post-challenge. prevention of leukopenia is one of several parameters used to evaluate response to vaccination after challenge with bvdv  <cit> , and in this case the lack of a decrease in wbc counts observed in group d could have been related to the effects of vaccination or to the presence of high levels of specific maternal antibodies. despite their ability to reduce clinical disease, maternally-derived bvdv antibodies were not as effective in preventing viremia and viral shedding in calves from the control group as 11/ <dig>  of the calves became viremic and of those 8/ <dig>  shed virus after challenge. for this study, we chose vi as our testing method in order to document clinically relevant shedding of live virus  <cit> . prior to challenge, the geometric mean of serum bvdv  <dig>  <dig> antibody titers of control calves was significantly lower compared with titers from groups b and c . low serum antibody titers prior to challenge with bvdv have been associated with an increased risk of viremia and clinical disease as demonstrated in previous studies  <cit> . other reports have indicated that calves with serum maternally-derived bvdv antibody titers <  <dig> before challenge with virulent bvdv have a higher risk of developing clinical disease and systemic spread of the virus compared to calves with greater antibody titers  <cit> .

antibody response to vaccination with mlv bvdv vaccines of young calves in the presence of maternally-derived bvdv antibodies has produced variable results. previous studies have demonstrated that  <dig> to 90-day-old calves with maternally-derived antibody titers ≤  <dig> against bvdv  <dig> and bvdv  <dig> prior to vaccination seroconvert after vaccination  <cit> ; additionally, these calves can develop an anamnestic response when a second dose of vaccine is administered  <cit> . in contrast, similar studies have demonstrated that  <dig> to 56-day-old calves with bvdv  <dig> and bvdv  <dig> maternally-derived antibody titers ≥  <dig> prior to vaccination usually do not seroconvert to vaccination and clinical protection against challenge with bvdv is variable  <cit> . in our study, a small proportion of calves vaccinated at weaning, at a median age of  <dig>  days, seroconverted to bvdv  <dig> after vaccination. in contrast, 50% of calves from group c seroconverted to bvdv  <dig> suggesting a greater ability of the vaccine c to overcome maternal interference to bvdv  <dig>  the higher levels of antibodies to bvdv  <dig> nadl and bvdv  <dig>  <dig> before challenge, the lower proportion of viremia, and the absence of viral shedding after challenge observed in calves from groups b and c suggests that vaccination with b and c may have primed b cell responses to increase specific antibody production or may have delayed the normal decay of maternal bvdv antibodies  <cit> . additionally, the higher levels of antibodies at challenge could have reduced viremia and prevented viral shedding in calves from the same groups. the reduction of viremia and viral shedding is a highly desirable outcome of vaccination since this could prevent bvdv transmission in operations such as feedlots and stocker units where high numbers of cattle from multiple origins are commingled.

the higher proportion of calves with viremia and virus shedding observed in group d could have been a consequence of the presence of more specific maternal antibodies induced by previous vaccination of the dams with vaccine d. the presence of more specific bvdv antibodies induced by vaccine d on colostra from the dams could have exerted a more efficient blockage of humoral cell responses of calves vaccinated with d. similar results were detected in a recent study in which lower antibody levels to bvdv 1a, bvdv 1b, and bvdv  <dig> and a higher proportion of viremia after bvdv  <dig> challenge were observed in calves  <dig> days after vaccination with d  <cit> . protection against viremia and virus shedding after experimental challenge with bvdv of calves vaccinated with mlv bvdv vaccines has been commonly associated with activation of t cell mediated immune responses independent of the induction of an adequate antibody response  <cit> . a previous study reported the depletion of cd4+ lymphocytes in calves acutely infected with bvdv could prolong the duration of viral shedding  <cit> . additionally, in another study, 80% of calves vaccinated at  <dig> days of age with a mlv bvdv vaccine and challenged 7- <dig> months later with virulent bvdv  <dig> became viremic after challenge; however, calves were protected against severe clinical disease in the absence of antibody responses at initial vaccination  <cit> . this indicates that induction of specific t cell memory responses after early vaccination may not always prevent viremia and virus shedding in young calves after challenge with bvdv. in the current study we did not evaluate bvdv-specific t cell responses to vaccination and challenge; however, it is possible that a stronger activation of t cell memory responses in calves vaccinated with d that became viremic could have reduced the duration of viremia to only  <dig> days; additionally, t cell memory responses in groups b and c could have been associated with the reduced proportion of calves with viremia and nasal shedding.

previous reports have demonstrated that acute bvdv infection in young calves can result in decreased weight gains and decreased performance  <cit> . in the current study, control calves had lower mean body weights at day  <dig> and at the end of the study compared with calves from groups b and c. mean body weights of control and group d calves were similar during the study. it is possible that vaccines b and c had a positive effect on weight gain after vaccination as previously reported  <cit> . additionally, the higher frequency of viremia in control and group d calves could have had a negative effect on performance and weight gain. another study demonstrated that young calves vaccinated with a mlv bvdv vaccine and subsequently challenged with virulent bvdv have higher mean body weights and average daily gains compared with non-vaccinated calves  <cit> . the higher mean body weights observed in calves from groups b and c at the end of the study suggest that higher levels of bvdv antibodies before challenge and prevention of viremia could have a positive effect on performance, although this observation would need further research using larger numbers of experimental subjects. prevention of weight loss could be a highly desirable outcome of vaccination programs for early weaned beef calves.

CONCLUSIONS
vaccination of young calves possessing maternally-derived immunity with multivalent mlv vaccines was demonstrated to be beneficial in reducing viremia and virus shedding following bvdv challenge at  <dig> days after vaccination. moderate to low levels of maternally-derived bvdv antibodies protected early weaned beef calves against severe clinical disease induced by challenge with virulent bvdv  <dig>  decay of maternally-derived bvdv antibodies was observed in all groups and just a small proportion of calves seroconverted to bvdv  <dig> after vaccination; however, the ability of mlv bvdv vaccines to prime b cell responses, induce antibody production, or delay the decay of maternal immunity could result in reduced numbers of viremic calves and prevent virus shedding as was observed in calves from groups b and c in the present study. reduction of viremia and bvdv shedding could result in decreased bvdv transmission and disease by increasing calf-herd immunity and reducing environmental load of free virus as has been suggested by a previous study  <cit> . additionally, mlv bvdv vaccines that reduce viremia after bvdv challenge could have a positive effect on calf performance and would be of most benefit when establishing health programs for early weaned beef calves.
