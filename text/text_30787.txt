BACKGROUND
by comparison with other vertebrates, mammals display a high degree of karyotype variability. chromosome numbers vary considerably, ranging from 2n =  <dig> in the indian muntjak  <cit>  to 2n =  <dig> in the red viscacha rat  <cit> . despite this numerical variability, conserved  chromosome segments have been successfully identified by means of comparative cytogenetics  <cit> . a conserved genome framework, initially concealed by inter-species karyotypic divergence, was first revealed by comparative gene mapping, but became readily apparent with the advent of comparative chromosome painting. the application of these methodologies has served to confirm the presence of a limited number of chromosomal segments which have been evolutionarily conserved across a variety of mammalian species  <cit> . taken together, these approaches have allowed the reconstruction of synteny maps of a number of ancestral mammalian genomes  <cit> .

recently performed comparisons of entire genome sequences have extended our understanding of the evolutionary history of mammalian genomes by revealing the presence of a limited number of syntenic segments with highly conserved gene orders, termed 'conserved linkage groups'  <cit> . these segments can be used, almost as if they were pieces of a giant jig-saw puzzle, to compare extant genomes as well as to reconstruct ancestral genomes. both comparative chromosome painting and genome sequence comparisons have indicated that the human genome possesses an organization which is highly conserved evolutionarily and which displays considerable similarity to the postulated ancestral eutherian karyotype  <cit>  dating from ~ <dig> million years ago   <cit> .

ancestral genome models deduced from comparative cytogenetic analysis exhibit marked differences when compared to reconstructions of ancestral eutherian genomes based on whole genome sequence alignments  <cit> . recently, we devised a simplified method of comparative genome analysis based on the comparison of gene order in different species. by focussing exclusively on the relative positions of genes instead of aligning large contigs of genomic dna, this method reduces the complexity of whole genome alignments thereby facilitating the identification of conserved syntenic segments. this technique was used successfully to identify the evolutionary origin of the mammalian x chromosome from three distinct ancestral chromosome building segments  <cit>  and has also made possible the reconstruction of a vertebrate protokaryotype from  <dig> mya  <cit> . since this methodology relies upon in silico gene order comparisons using genome sequence data from different species, an approach reminiscent of comparative chromosome painting, the in silico approach has been termed 'e-painting'   <cit> .

estimates of the number, location and extent of evolutionary breakpoint intervals vary owing to methodological differences, and this variation has helped to fuel considerable controversy. recent comparative genome sequence studies have been interpreted as indicating that evolutionary chromosomal rearrangements are non-randomly distributed across mammalian genomes and that the associated breakpoints have often been 'reused'  <cit> . the resulting 'fragile breakage model' of genome evolution has therefore presented a direct challenge to the now classical 'random breakage' model of nadeau and taylor  <cit> .

in this study, we have performed an in silico genome-wide analysis of synteny  in order to improve our understanding of the organization of the ancestral eutherian genome. our analysis employed genome sequence data from human  <cit> , mouse  <cit> , rat  <cit> , dog  <cit> , cow ; b_tau <dig> , and opossum  <cit> , genomes which have all been sequenced with at least 7-fold coverage. the chicken genome sequence  <cit>  was also included in our comparison since previous studies have shown that chicken genome organization displays a remarkable resemblance to that of eutherian mammals  <cit>  despite its evolutionary divergence about  <dig> mya.

RESULTS
establishment of syntenic relationships and reconstruction of ancestral karyotypes
a previous comparative synteny analysis of about  <dig> human genes and their orthologues in  <dig> other vertebrate species permitted the first reconstruction of an ancestral vertebrate karyotype  <cit> . in this study, we have extended this comparative approach to identifying syntenic segments of orthologous genes and included all those human genes for which orthologues have been annotated in the genomes of mouse, rat, dog, cow, opossum  and chicken. beginning with  <dig> human genes , the number of orthologous genes in the studied species identified by the program biomart ranges from  <dig> in chicken to  <dig> in mouse . the maximum number of orthologous genes identifiable in a given species  was recruited on the basis that the higher the number of genes employed in the analysis, the more precise would be the identification of the breakpoint intervals. had we considered only those genes for which a one-to-one orthology relationship was identifiable in all species under investigation, this would have resulted in a considerable decrease in the number of genes to be analysed and hence a substantial decrease in the degree of resolution possible. instead, the genome-wide coverage attained by using the maximum number of orthologous genes identifiable between human and the other studied vertebrate species served to optimize the resolution of the mapping of the evolutionary chromosomal breakpoints.

a: orthologous genes were determined using the program biomart

.

the dataset from human, representing the best characterized vertebrate genome to date , provided the reference against which segments of conserved syntenic genes could be identified in the genomes of the other species under investigation. in principle, blocks or segments containing syntenic human genes were sought which are also present as blocks of syntenic genes in the other species under study. conversion of the syntenic segment associations into colour-coded ideograms rendered the conserved syntenic segments  readily identifiable . the colour code employed in figure  <dig> was used to indicate the orthologous relationships of syntenic segments in a comparison of the different species with human, as depicted in figure  <dig>  additional file  <dig> and figure  <dig>  for example, the region of human chromosome  <dig> between positions  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb is identifiable as a continuous  segment on rat chromosome  <dig> and mouse chromosome  <dig> . during our analysis, we considered as evolutionary breakpoints those disruptions in gene order  that resulted from  interchromosomal rearrangements in an ancestral species as deduced by comparing human with one of the other six species under investigation and  intrachromosomal inversions that occurred in the human lineage where both breakpoint regions could be identified. if the breakpoint region of an interchromosomal rearrangement, identified by comparing the human genome with that of another species, was found to coincide with the breakpoint of an intrachromosomal rearrangement in any one of the other species, this intrachromosomal breakpoint was also considered as a break in synteny.

employing these criteria to define evolutionary breakpoint intervals, a total of  <dig> such intervals, with an average size of  <dig> kb and a median size of  <dig> kb, were identified . to visualize all syntenic breakpoint intervals, chromosome ideograms were drawn up such that all breakpoints were arranged equidistantly, with the precise positions of the breakpoint intervals being demarcated by the genomic coordinates of the flanking genes . the orthologous relationships between the analyzed genomes served to identify a total of  <dig> different ancestral syntenic segments which are indicated by a colour code in figure  <dig>  the ideograms in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig> are equivalent to a reverse chromosome painting dataset of the six analyzed species onto human chromosomes at high resolution. the precise positions of the genes flanking all identified breakpoint intervals are listed in additional file  <dig>

the graphical compilation of syntenic disruptions shown in additional file  <dig> indicates that  <dig> % of the evolutionary breakpoints  have been 'reused' i.e. breakpoints were found in the same genomic intervals in at least three species from two different clades . the assignment of the species under investigation to different clades within the mammalian phylogenetic tree is indicated in additional file  <dig> . taking all autosomes into consideration,  <dig> breakpoint regions were identified in a comparison of the chicken and human genomes whereas  <dig> breaks in synteny serve to differentiate the human and opossum chromosomes. a total of  <dig> breakpoints were found to be shared between chicken and opossum but were not observed in any other species, suggesting that these constitute evolutionary breakpoints that occurred in the eutherian common ancestor . a comparison of the gene orders exhibited by both murid species with those of humans, revealed  <dig> breaks in synteny . however, only  <dig> breaks in synteny were specific to the rat whereas  <dig> were specific to the mouse. the many murid-shared breaks in synteny  as compared with humans is clearly a reflection of the extended common phylogenetic history of mouse and rat, which only became separated into distinct species 16– <dig> mya  <cit> . the two ferungulate species, dog and cow, only share  <dig> breaks, with  <dig> breaks being restricted to the canine lineage and  <dig> breaks confined to the bovine lineage  <cit> . the much higher number of lineage-specific breaks in these two species, both of which belong to the laurasiatheria, is indicative of the longer period of time that has elapsed since the evolutionary divergence of the carnivores and artiodactyls ~ <dig> mya  <cit> .

the version of the cow genome used for our analysis  may contain some local errors caused by intrachromosomal misplacement of scaffold. these intrachromosomal inconsistencies are not however relevant to the tests we have performed since we were primarily interested in analysing interchromosomal rearrangements between the human and bovine genomes.

several breaks in synteny were identified in mouse, rat, dog, cow, opossum and chicken that are common to all six species . the most parsimonious explanation for this observation is not breakpoint 'reuse' but rather that these were primate-  specific breaks. some  <dig> such primate lineage-specific breakpoints were identified and these are indicated by stippled red lines in the ideograms . most of these breaks appear to have been caused by primate-specific inversions . proportional to its length, hsa <dig> is especially rich in such primate-specific inversions. a disproportionate number of these inversions were also noted in the orthologous segment of hsa19p in the lineage leading to rodents, in the orthologous segment of hsa20p in the lineage leading to chicken and in the orthologous segment of hsa <dig> in the canine lineage . the remaining primate-specific breakpoints may be attributable to chromosome fusions and insertions of small segments.

a: these  <dig> inversion breakpoint regions were deduced, from the human genome sequence, to harbour the second breakpoint of the respective primate-specific inversions. they were, however, not evident as such in the sequences of the  <dig> species under investigation  and hence are not indicated in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> 

b: the superscript numbers in the last column indicate putative inversions. thus, chromosomes orthologous to hsa  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were not rearranged in the primate lineage.

employing the previously described method of concatenating overlapping conserved syntenic segments  <cit> , the eutherian mammal genome data permitted the seamless assembly of conserved segments into ancestral chromosomes. ancestral associations between conserved syntenic segments are identifiable by virtue of the presence of shared orthologies between mammalian chromosomes from at least three different species. the resulting model of the ancestral boreoeutherian genome , with a chromosome number of 2n =  <dig>  describes the karyotype of the last common ancestor of primates and rodents  as well as of carnivores and cetartiodactyls .

chromosomal sites of syntenic breakage
high precision syntenic breakpoint mapping permits the evaluation, at least in principle, of whether or not these evolutionary breaks coincide with potential hotspots of chromosomal rearrangement such as fragile sites or cancer-associated breakpoints. fragile sites are classified as either rare  or common   <cit> . altogether, some  <dig> common fragile sites have been mapped at the cytogenetic level  <cit>  although only the  <dig> most common autosomal fragile sites have been precisely characterized at the molecular level  <cit> . a comparison of these  <dig> precisely characterized fragile sites with the positions of the evolutionary breakpoints identified in this study indicated that only fra4f and fra7e, which span distances of  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb respectively, partially overlap with evolutionary breakpoint regions . for none of the other  <dig> evolutionary breakpoints was any overlap with a fragile site observed. under a random model, we estimate that ~ <dig> %  of the  <dig> observed breakpoints intervals would have been expected to overlap with one of the  <dig> fragile sites. since only 2/ <dig> breakpoints  were found to display an overlap with a fragile site , we concluded that there was no evidence for extensive co-location.

a second class of chromosomal breakage hotspot is represented by recurring cancer-associated breakpoints. although the majority of such breakpoints have been assigned to cytogenetic bands, they have not yet been mapped with any degree of precision. a variety of genes, with actual or potential roles in tumorigenesis, nevertheless reside at or near these breakpoints. we therefore identified the exact genomic positions of  <dig> annotated cancer-associated autosomal genes using the atlas of genetics and cytogenetics in oncology and haematology . for the purposes of this analysis, only well-established cancer-associated genes were included . other genes in this database that have not yet been convincingly implicated in cancer were not included in this analysis. of the  <dig> cancer genes, only  <dig> mapped to evolutionary breakpoint intervals identified in this study . since the  <dig> evolutionary breakpoint intervals together comprise  <dig>  mb of genomic sequence, we estimate that some  <dig> cancer-associated genes might have been expected to occur within the breakpoint intervals by chance alone. we therefore conclude that genes occurring at cancer-associated breakpoints are not disproportionately represented within regions of evolutionary breakpoints.

a: evolutionary breakpoint intervals are indicated with respect to their position on the orthologous human chromosome.

b: data on cancer-associated genes were extracted from the atlas of genetics and cytogenetics in oncology and haematology .

the question then arises as to the location of these evolutionary breakpoints in relation to genes and other dna sequence features. as mentioned above, a total of  <dig> primate-specific breaks in synteny were identified in this analysis. remarkably, 78% of these breakpoint intervals coincide with segmental duplications  in the human genome  despite the fact that sds comprise only 4–5% of the human genome sequence  <cit> . colocalization with copy number variants  was also observed in the case of 76% of these breakpoints . thus, primate-specific breakpoint regions would appear to be highly enriched for both sds and cnvs.

those human chromosomes that are known to be gene-dense also appear to contain significantly more breakpoints than gene-poor chromosomes . indeed, a strong correlation was noted between protein-coding gene density and the number of evolutionary breakpoints per chromosome . when the gene-dense chromosomes hsa <dig>  hsa <dig> and hsa <dig> were directly compared with the gene-poor chromosomes hsa <dig>  hsa <dig> and hsa <dig>  the gene-dense chromosomes exhibited nearly three times as many breaks per mb as gene-poor chromosomes.

a: according to the ensembl database, version  <dig> i. the gene density per chromosome was found to be correlated with the number of breakpoint intervals .

we further observed a correlation between transcript density and breakpoint occurrence . to calculate this correlation coefficient, we used the human transcriptome map, based on the draft human genome sequence as provided by the ucsc genome bioinformatics project , which includes all transcribed sequences except processed pseudogenes . the correlation noted between transcript density and breakpoint occurrence became even stronger when chromosomal regions were considered rather than entire chromosomes. the evolutionary breakpoint regions identified here exhibited a  <dig> -fold increase in transcript density for the central  <dig> mb of syntenic breakpoint regions as compared to the genome average . when this analysis was further restricted to the  <dig> most precisely mapped breakpoint intervals of < <dig> kb, the transcript density attained a value some  <dig>  times that of the genome-wide average . finally, analyses of breakpoint intervals assigned to individual evolutionary lineages indicated that the breakpoint regions identified in both chicken and opossum lineages displayed very high transcript densities corresponding to  <dig>  times the genomic average .

nb. estimates of both the average size of the breakpoint interval and the transcript density are sensitive to the relative-fold sequence coverage of the respective genomes. however, calculating values for the increase above the genome average transcript density allows valid inter-genome comparisons to be made.

random breakage or non-random location of evolutionary breakpoints
in order to ascertain whether the evolutionary breakpoints identified in this study occurred randomly or were instead preferentially located in certain genomic regions, we performed simulation experiments. to avoid consideration of breakpoints that did not result from independent breakage , we selected only breakpoints that were present in mouse, cow, opossum and chicken, respectively. breakpoints in rat and dog were excluded from this analysis in order to avoid consideration of breakpoints that could have been identical-by-descent and shared either by mouse and rat or by dog and cow. for example, breakpoints present in mouse and rat  could have been identical-by-descent yet would have been counted twice in our analysis. thus, only breakpoints in mouse and cow were considered  in order to avoid the potential double-counting of some evolutionary breakpoints. those  <dig> breakpoint regions observed in all  <dig> species  compared to human, and which were thus specific to the primate lineage, were also excluded . finally, a total of  <dig> breakpoints were considered that were evident in four species . these  <dig> breakpoints occurred in  <dig> genomic regions,  <dig> of which contained a breakpoint observed in only one species , whereas  <dig> genomic regions contained breakpoints in two species, and  <dig> genomic regions contained breakpoints in three species.

by means of a simulation with  <dig>  iterations, we then estimated the proportion of the genome in which these  <dig> breakpoints would have been expected to occur, by chance alone, given a certain specified number of genomic regions available to harbour evolutionary breakpoints . for these simulations, the human genome was partitioned into  <dig>  regions, each  <dig>  mb in length . assuming a random breakage model for the entire genome, partitioned into  <dig>  equal-sized genomic segments available to harbour breakpoint regions, the  <dig> evolutionary breakpoints would have been expected to occur in between  <dig> and  <dig> regions with 99% probability . in other words, given random breakage, a maximum of 19/ <dig>  breakpoints might reasonably have been expected to co-locate by chance to the same regions at the 1% level of probability. in practice, however, we have noted that the  <dig> observed evolutionary breakpoints were confined to only  <dig> breakpoint regions. according to our simulations , this number of breakpoint regions would be expected if only 7–10% of the genome  were available to harbour evolutionary breakpoints. thus, according to our model-based simulations, the observation of  <dig> breakpoints being located within  <dig> out of  <dig>  genomic regions is most plausible when the occurrence of breakpoints is confined to only 7–10% of the genome. even if we were to assume that some 20% of the genome could harbour evolutionary breakpoints, the observed distribution has a <1% probability of occurring under the model of random breakage. we therefore feel confident in rejecting the null hypothesis that these breakage events occurred randomly. we instead conclude that they occurred preferentially within certain genomic regions.

among the  <dig> breakpoints considered in the above mentioned simulation analysis were  <dig> breaks in synteny that occurred in the same genomic interval in both chicken and opossum, but not in mouse or cow. these breakpoints shared by chicken and opossum could however have been identical-by-descent and would thus have occurred only once in the eutherian common ancestor, not twice as we implicitly assumed in the previously described simulations. in order to avoid double counting of some breakpoints, we repeated the simulations, this time considering only the breakpoint regions in mouse , cow  and opossum . a total of  <dig> breakpoint intervals were found to be shared by these species, whereas  <dig> breakpoint regions were unique to the species considered. during these simulations, the genome was subdivided into  <dig>  bins, each of length  <dig>  mb , and the  <dig> mammalian breakpoints were distributed between these bins. the simulation experiments served to demonstrate that the breakpoint positions are incompatible with a random model of breakage. the expected number of breakpoint regions under this model was calculated to be  <dig> ; in none of the  <dig>  simulation runs was such a low number of breakpoint intervals noted as that actually observed . when the model was relaxed to  <dig> selected bins ,  <dig>  unique breakpoints would have been expected . on the other hand, a model with  <dig> bins, i.e. one using ~10% of the genome, appears to be compatible with the observed values: expected number of unique breakpoints =  <dig>  .

discussion
refining the structure of boreoeutherian ancestral chromosomes
comparative genome maps, based on more than eighty species of eutherian mammal, have previously been generated by chromosome painting. such analyses have revealed the pathways of mammalian genome evolution at the chromosomal level  <cit> . however, comparative chromosome painting is inadequate to the task of comparing the genomes of species which have been separated for more than  <dig> million years. this is due to the lower hybridization efficiency of probes consequent to increased sequence divergence. thus, reports of successful hybridizations of eutherian probes onto marsupial chromosomes are confined to a single chromosome  <cit> . to overcome this limitation, comparative genome sequence analyses based on direct genome alignments have been performed with the aim of reconstructing precise ancestral gene orders  <cit> . however, models of ancestral eutherian genome organization constructed from such genome sequence alignments display considerable differences with respect to the assignment of ancestral syntenic groups, when compared to models derived from comparative chromosome painting data  <cit> .

e-painting   <cit>  was introduced in order both to overcome the inherent limitations of comparative cytogenetic approaches and to reduce the complexity of direct whole genome sequence alignments. this in silico technique is based on the comparative mapping of orthologous genes and the identification of conserved syntenic segments of genes instead of comparative alignments of large sequence contigs containing intergenic sequences as well as genes. the advantage of e-painting over comparative genome sequence analysis is that the former reduces the complexity of genome alignments to easily manageable conserved syntenic segments comprising orthologous genes. its limitation, however, is that it cannot be applied to the investigation of telomeric, centromeric or non-genic regions that could have nevertheless played an important role during karyotype evolution.

in the present study, e-painting was used to reinvestigate the previously proposed boreoeutherian protokaryotype  <cit> . the resulting model of the boreoeutherian genome  closely resembles those models previously derived by means of comparative chromosome painting. indeed, our data derived from e-painting analysis not only confirmed all major syntenic segment associations proposed in previous studies  <cit>  but also served to refine the model by accommodating short syntenic segments orthologous to portions of chromosomes hsa <dig>  hsa <dig>  hsa <dig> and hsa <dig> .

the improved definition of ancestral eutherian chromosomes by e-painting achieved in this study is particularly evident in the context of the evolution of chromosomes hsa <dig> and hsa <dig>  a common feature of previously proposed protokaryotypes has been the presence of two different protochromosomes displaying associations of hsa <dig> and hsa <dig>  as is evident from the colour-coded ideograms in fig.  <dig>  the larger protochromosome, 12p-q/22q, comprises an extended 12p-q segment stretching from hsa12pter to a point  <dig>  mb from 12q and includes the terminal segment of hsa22q . further, we have identified a third proximal  <dig>  mb segment from hsa22q  that bears the same colour code in all analyzed species  and which must therefore also form part of this large protochromosome. additionally, the e-painting indicated that the ancestral chromosome orthologous to hsa10q should be extended by a  <dig>  mb-sized proximal portion of its p-arm . the existence of this extension was supported by both eutherian and chicken genome sequence data and indicates that the breakpoint is located in a region orthologous to 10p rather than within the centromere .

importantly, e-painting using the opossum and chicken genomes indicated an hsa10p/12/ <dig> association . these findings, taken together with recent comparative chromosome painting data supporting the 10p/12/ <dig> association in the afrotheria and in some xenarthra  <cit>  and carnivores  <cit> , strongly corroborate an ancestral 10p/12/ <dig> chromosome as part of the ancestral eutherian karyotype. furthermore, this 10p/12/ <dig> association is compatible with an ancestral eutherian chromosome number of 2n =  <dig> .

the extensive agreement between ancestral genome reconstructions based respectively upon comparative chromosome painting and e-painting is strongly supportive of the validity of the e-painting approach. further, the e-painting analysis performed here has confirmed the previously proposed ancestral eutherian chromosome associations, 3/ <dig>  4/ <dig>  7/ <dig>  10/12/ <dig>  12/ <dig>  16/ <dig> and 14/ <dig>  <cit> , since all these associations are readily identifiable in the opossum genome. however, the 3/ <dig> association in the opossum involves a different set of genes as compared to the 3/ <dig> association in the eutherian species, thereby indicating the presence of additional rearrangements involving the corresponding chromosomal regions in marsupials.

recent comparative chromosome painting studies performed with several afrotherian  <cit>  and xenarthran species  <cit>  have indicated that their karyotypes display a remarkable degree of similarity to the previously proposed ancestral boreoeutherian karyotype  <cit> . the chromosomal associations 1/ <dig> and 5/ <dig> seem, however, to be specific to afrotherians  <cit>  with no xenarthran-specific chromosomal rearrangements having been identified as yet  <cit> .

our findings indicate that none of the afrotherian-specific rearrangements are evident in the opossum genome. this finding, together with the observation that the above mentioned ancestral eutherian chromosome associations are also present in the opossum, suggest that the ancestral boreoeutherian karyotype is very similar to the ancestral eutherian karyotype .

chromosomal distribution of evolutionary breakpoints
the comparative synteny analysis presented here has succeeded in defining evolutionary chromosomal breakpoints with a considerably higher degree of resolution than has previously been achieved. for example, the length of the median breakpoint interval in this study is only  <dig> kb . furthermore, the average length  of the breakpoint intervals assigned here is about a quarter of that reported by murphy et al.  <cit> . ruiz-herrera et al.  <cit> , in a second related study, included data from murphy et al.  <cit>  but added further species with even less precisely defined breakpoint data. the present study has avoided the uncertainty inherent in matching up cytogenetic band information with genome sequence data. the assessment of the spatial correlation between evolutionary chromosomal breakpoints and dna sequence features such as gene density, gc-content, segmental duplications and copy number variations , promises to yield new insights into mechanisms of chromosomal rearrangement whose relevance may well extend beyond the confines of evolution and into the sphere of genetic disease .

in this study, a total of  <dig> evolutionary breakpoint intervals were identified. knowledge of their respective genomic positions then allowed us to address the question as to whether evolutionary breakpoints co-locate with cancer-associated breakpoints and/or common fragile sites, an issue which has been quite contentious over the last few years  <cit> . the original 'random breakage model' of nadeau and taylor  <cit>  has been challenged by pevzner and tesler  <cit>  who favour an alternative model in which at least some evolutionary breakpoint regions are prone to repeated breakage in the context of disease-related rearrangements. inherent to the latter model is the prediction that evolutionary breaks will frequently overlap with fragile sites and cancer-associated breakpoints  <cit> . the precise mapping data presented here are not however compatible with such a physical overlap of breakpoints. when considering fragile sites, rare and common sites must be clearly distinguished  <cit> . rare fragile sites are less frequent and, at the dna sequence level, are associated with expanded repeats. in some cases, such sites are associated with a specific clinical phenotype  <cit> . by contrast, common fragile sites  are observed in different mammalian species  <cit>  and may be spatially associated with large active gene clusters  <cit> . in our analysis, we focussed exclusively on the  <dig> common fragile sites that have been well characterized at the dna sequence level  <cit>  but only two of these sites were found to exhibit partial overlap with an evolutionary breakpoint interval  identified here . we cannot however make any statement with respect to a potential overlap between the evolutionary breakpoints and those common fragile sites that are hitherto poorly mapped and remain uncharacterized at the dna sequence level.

a second class of common chromosomal breakpoint is represented by those breakpoints associated with tumorigenesis. these cancer-related breakage events frequently generate fusion genes that are commonly characterized by gains of function  <cit> . to refine the dna sequence positions of known cancer-associated breakpoints, we utilized the known sequence coordinates of  <dig> cancer-associated genes. these were then cross-compared with the  <dig> evolutionary breakpoint intervals identified in our analysis. however, no evidence was found for the known cancer-associated genes  being over-represented within regions of evolutionary chromosomal breakpoints.

a word of caution is appropriate here. although it may eventually prove possible to identify unequivocally the positions of many evolutionary and cancer-associated breakpoints, there is no a priori reason to suppose that these breakpoints should occur in precisely the same locations. indeed, there is every reason to believe that, even if we were to focus our attention upon those breakpoints which colocalize to the extended regions characterized by segmental duplication, these breakpoints would probably occur in heterogeneous locations with respect to the various genes present within the unstable regions. this is because, in order to come to clinical attention, somatic cancer-associated gene rearrangements must confer a growth advantage upon the affected cells or tissue, usually via gene deregulation or through the creation of a fusion gene. evolutionary rearrangements  represent the other side of the coin: they could not have become fixed had they been disadvantageous to individuals of the species concerned. it follows that the rearrangements derived in these two quite different contexts  are likely  to have affected the structure, function and expression of different genes in different ways,  to have been subject to quite different 'selective pressures' in these different contexts and hence  would have been most unlikely to have occurred in precisely the same genomic locations. in agreement with these predictions, a different regional distribution of cancer-associated and evolutionary breakpoints has been noted by sankoff et al.  <cit>  whilst helmrich et al.  <cit>  failed to detect any overlap between fragile sites and evolutionary breakpoints.

our e-painting data do however provide some support for the postulate that evolutionary breakpoints have been 'reused', sensu lato  <cit> . indeed,  <dig> % of the identified evolutionary breakpoint intervals identified here contain two or more breakpoints. by computer simulation, we confirmed that the distribution of the  <dig> observed breakpoints into only  <dig> different genomic segments is best explained by non-random breakage with only ~7–10% of the genome harbouring evolutionary breakpoints. this proportion is somewhat lower than that previously reported  for the 'reuse' of breakpoint regions  <cit>  but this could be due to the higher resolution breakpoint mapping achieved here. recently, breakpoint 'reuse' has also been noted in the case of a recurrent inversion on the eutherian x chromosome  <cit>  and in a comparison of chicken chromosome gga <dig> with orthologous syntenic segments in human, fish , amphibian , opossum, dog and mouse  <cit> . taken together, these findings are quite compatible with the fragile breakage model of chromosome evolution first proposed by pevzner and tesler  <cit>  and sustained by the more recent analysis of alekseyev and pevzner  <cit> .

our data confirm and extend previous reports of associations between segmental duplications  with evolutionary rearrangements  <cit> . sds comprise 4–5% of human autosomal euchromatin  <cit>  whereas the primate lineage-specific breakpoint intervals comprise  <dig> % of the euchromatin. this notwithstanding, some 78% of the evolutionary breakpoint intervals colocalize with known sds whilst 76% coincide with regions of known copy number variation . these proportions are significantly higher than those reported from comparative analyses of evolutionary breakpoints between the human and murine lineages  <cit> . this difference is probably due to the focus in the present analysis having been placed upon primate lineage-specific breakage.

turning to the sites at which evolutionarily fixed chromosomal breaks have occurred, we have previously mapped at the dna sequence level the breakpoints of eight inversions that serve to distinguish the human and chimpanzee karyotypes  <cit> . none of these rearrangements is as yet known to be associated with either the activation or inactivation of genes at or near the breakpoint sites. the present study indicates that, at least in the primate lineage, the evolutionary breakpoints are enriched for sds whilst overlapping to a similar extent with sites of known copy number variants. this concurs with recent findings from comparative studies of syntenic disruptions between gibbon and human chromosomes  <cit> . indeed, nearly half of all gibbon-human breaks in synteny occur within regions of segmental duplication in the human genome, thereby providing further evidence for the evolutionary plasticity of these regions which has clearly been responsible for promoting a significant proportion of the chromosomal breaks in primates  <cit> .

our analysis has revealed an even stronger correlation between high gene density and evolutionary fragility than that previously reported  <cit> . although the evolutionary breakpoint regions identified here display about  <dig> to  <dig> times the transcript density of the euchromatic genome average , it would seem rather unlikely that evolutionary breakpoints have frequently disrupted gene coding regions. intriguingly, a study of chicken chromosome gga <dig>  <cit>  has revealed that evolutionary breakpoint regions, identified through the analysis of human-chicken synteny, are disproportionately located in regions with a high gc-content and high cpg island density rather than in gene-dense regions per se. thus, it is tempting to speculate that at least some of these evolutionary breakpoints, particularly those occurring in gene-associated cpg-islands, could have contributed to functional changes in mammalian gene structure or expression  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have presented an approach that greatly reduces the complexity of comparative genome sequence analysis and which is capable of providing valuable insights into the dynamics of eutherian karyotype evolution. the gene synteny analysis data yielded high definition evolutionary breakpoint maps which have significantly improved the resolution of existing maps derived by chromosome painting  <cit> . correlation analyses with similarly well mapped cancer-associated breakpoints and fragile sites however failed to provide any evidence for an association with evolutionary breakpoints. we nevertheless noted a higher than previously observed positive correlation of evolutionary breakpoints with gene density and also corroborated the reported association of segmental duplications with evolutionary breakpoints in the primate lineage. the ancestral eutherian genome, reconstructed through e-painting, displays a high degree of agreement with that derived from the much larger comparative cytogenetic dataset. the inclusion of a marsupial genome in this comparison, which has not hitherto been attempted, suggested that the ancestral boreoeutherian karyotype was probably very similar to the ancestral eutherian karyotype.
