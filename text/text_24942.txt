BACKGROUND
transcriptional silencing in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae occurs at the silent mating-type loci hmr and hml, telomeres, and at the rdna locus. at all of these silenced regions, dna binding proteins recognize specific motifs and recruit a silencing protein complex . hmr and hml are flanked by e and i "silencers." each silencer has binding sites for orc, and rap <dig> or abf <dig>  the potent hmr-e silencer has a binding site for all three proteins. at telomeres, rap <dig> also contributes a critical dna-binding function, binding to the tg1– <dig> repeats.

at both the silent mating loci and at telomeres, the dna-binding proteins recruit a sir protein complex that can spread to silence genes at a distance . at hmr-e, for example, this is achieved by orc recruitment of sir <dig> via a sir1-orc <dig> interaction  <cit> , and rap <dig> and abf <dig> binding to sir <dig> and sir <dig>  <cit> . sir <dig> and sir <dig> multimerize, both with themselves and each other  <cit> . sir <dig> also binds sir <dig>  and sir <dig> plays a crucial role in the spreading of a sir <dig>  sir <dig>  sir <dig> complex on chromatin by deacetylating histone h <dig> lysine  <dig>  the deacetylation produces a novel product, 2' o-acetyl-adp-ribose  <cit> . this compound has recently been shown to produce a conformational change in sir <dig> that is likely to promote spreading of the sir complex. sir <dig>  sir <dig> and sir <dig> are essential for silencing at the hm loci and at telomeres, while sir <dig> plays a prominent role in silencing at the mating type loci but not at telomeres. the yku70/yku <dig> heterodimer that binds to dna ends plays an important role in silencing at telomeres, while being dispensable for silencing at hm loci  <cit> .

deletion of the hmr-e silencer leads to loss of silencing of genes at the hmr locus  <cit> . however, if heterologous dna binding sites  are integrated in place of hmr-e and the strain is transformed with certain gal <dig> dna binding domain  – silencing protein hybrids, silencing can be restored due to targeting of sir proteins or proteins that bind to sir proteins to hmr-e . this so-called "targeted silencing" has been a useful tool for investigating the process of sir protein recruitment to silenced loci  <cit> . we previously described a screen for proteins capable of targeted silencing at hmr  <cit> . in this screen many known proteins were identified, as well as several proteins not characterized at the time, which we called esc proteins because they establish silent chromatin. one of these was esc <dig> whose characterization we describe in this report. rtt107/esc <dig> was also identified in screens for mutants with increased ty transposon mobility or dna repair defects  <cit> . for simplicity we will only use the name esc <dig> in the remainder of this paper. esc <dig> has been shown to be phosphorylated by mec <dig> kinase on sq/tq motifs in response to dna damage during s phase  <cit> . the phosphorylation by mec <dig> has quite recently been proposed to be regulated by slx <dig>  which was also shown to form a complex containing esc <dig>  <cit> .

in this report we show that esc <dig> has  <dig> brct motifs and that they are important for its function. many proteins that function in repair, and even a silencing protein, rap <dig>  contain brct  motifs. this motif was first identified by database searching using the c-terminus of the human breast cancer susceptibility protein, brca <dig>  <cit> . since then, brct motifs from the human dna repair protein xrcc <dig> and the two tandem brct motifs of brca <dig> protein have been crystallized  <cit>  and crystal and/or solution structures have also been solved of brcts from 53bp <dig>  dna ligase iii, and an nad-dependent dna ligase  <cit> . more recently, it was discovered that brct motifs could specifically bind to phosphoserine-containing proteins  <cit>  and structures of such complexes were subsequently also determined  <cit> . overall, brct motifs are thought to mediate a diverse array of protein-protein interactions, binding to proteins with different structures, as well as to other brcts, both inter- and intra-molecularly .

dna repair requires many dna-modifying enzymes such as nucleases, ligases, topoisomerases, polymerases and helicases. saccharomyces cerevisiae sgs <dig> is a member of the recq family of genes encoding dna helicases. in addition to escherichia coli recq, this helicase gene family includes human blm, wrn, recql, and schizosaccharomyces pombe rqh1+. members of the recq family of helicases have been implicated in genomic stability, aging and cancer. yeast sgs <dig> has been shown by several labs to suppress dna recombination, gross chromosomal rearrangements, and ty <dig> transposition, and to exhibit 3' to 5' helicase activity  <cit> . six slx genes have been isolated in a synthetic lethal screen using an sgs1Δ mutant  <cit> . two of these genes, slx <dig> and slx <dig>  encode the mus81/mms <dig> nuclease that acts on branched dna structures. slx <dig> is also predicted to be a nuclease, based on its sequence  <cit> . slx <dig> and slx <dig> coimmunoprecipitate and slx <dig> and slx <dig> mutants display similar phenotypes and have been proposed to function together  <cit> . in addition, a genome-wide genetic interaction  screen isolated a total of  <dig> genes that show a synthetic growth interaction with an sgs1Δ mutation  <cit> . this screen identified  <dig> of the  <dig> slx genes previously identified in the sgs1Δ synthetic lethal screen described above  <cit> , as well as three other genes known to show synthetic interactions  <cit> . the screen also identified  <dig> other genes that caused synthetic lethality or sickness when mutated with sgs1Δ. one of these genes was esc <dig>  subsequently, there have been other reports confirming this genetic interaction between sgs <dig> and esc <dig>  <cit> .

here we demonstrate that the c-terminal two brct motifs of esc <dig> bind to sir <dig> and are sufficient for sir-dependent targeted silencing at hmr. furthermore, the n-terminal four brct motifs in esc <dig> bind to slx <dig>  thus linking this dna repair protein to silent chromatin.

RESULTS
esc <dig> establishes targeted silencing when targeted to hmr
in a screen described previously, we identified esc <dig> as a protein that could restore silencing when targeted to an hmr locus harboring a deletion of the hmr-e silencer  <cit> . targeting of proteins to hmr was mediated by the binding of a gal <dig> dna binding domain -hybrid protein to a gal <dig> dna binding site  that replaced the hmr-e silencer . silencing was assessed using a ura <dig> reporter gene integrated at the hmr locus.

targeted silencing by esc <dig> is sir-dependent
in order to understand how esc <dig> promoted silencing when targeted to the hmr locus, we tested silencing by gbd-esc <dig> in various strains. first, targeted silencing by gbd-esc <dig> was compared to gbd alone or to the potent targeted silencing factor gbd-esc <dig> in the strain in which the screen was performed, which has the entire hmr-e silencer deleted and replaced with a gal <dig> dna binding site   <cit> . the fraction of cells silenced by gbd-esc <dig> was not as great as by gbd-esc <dig> but, nevertheless, significant targeted silencing at hmr was observed despite the complete absence of the hmr-e silencer . when targeted silencing by gbd-esc <dig> was assessed in strains harboring deletions of just the e and b sites  or the a and e sites  of the hmr-e silencer, silencing was increased roughly  <dig> to 100-fold, as expected for strains with at least one element of the natural silencer .

to test whether targeted silencing by gbd-esc <dig> was sir-dependent, it was tested in strains deleted for the sir <dig>  sir <dig> or sir <dig> genes. as seen in figure  <dig>  silencing by esc <dig> required each of these sir genes. this was expected since targeted silencing by other proteins has been shown to be sir-dependent in every case examined previously  <cit> . it thus seemed likely that esc <dig> caused silencing by recruiting the sir protein complex.

saccharomyces esc <dig> proteins contain six brct motifs and are homologous to s. pombe brc1
esc <dig> contains several copies of the brct motif, originally identified in the human breast cancer susceptibility gene, brca <dig>  <cit> . the presence of these motifs in esc <dig>  has been observed previously by database searches  <cit> , although there has been disagreement as to how many brcts exist in this protein, with some reports suggesting six brcts  <cit>  and others only four  <cit> . our own analyses including use of pfam  <cit>  confirms the first five putative brcts in esc <dig>  and it seems likely that residues 935– <dig>  which are brct-like with a conserved w or y residue near the c-terminus, also form a domain that folds into a brct type structure as previously reported  <cit>  . furthermore, analysis of a homolog of esc <dig> from s. pombe, brc <dig>  using pfam shows six brcts in this homologous protein, with the last two again being the most alternative , further supporting a conserved total of six motifs in these homologs .

the six brct motifs of esc <dig> protein exist as a set of four tandem motifs at the n-terminus of the protein and two more at the c-terminus . these two sets of brct motifs are separated by a  <dig> amino acid linker region. although there are proteins from various budding yeasts with compelling sequence similarity to s. cerevisiae esc <dig> , currently the only obvious non-budding yeast homolog candidate is brc <dig> from the evolutionarily distant fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe . s. pombe brc <dig> is  <dig> amino acids in length and also contains four brcts at the n-terminus and two at the c-terminus, separated by a linker region. esc <dig> and brc <dig> are 52% similar and 21% identical overall. human and mouse ptip proteins have been reported to be quite similar in sequence  <cit> , but do not contain the classically-conserved c-terminal aromatic residue present in all of the six brcts highlighted with a red asterisk in the alignment shown in figure  <dig>  therefore, it is not yet clear if these proteins are bona fide esc4/brc <dig> homologs.

the c-terminal two brct motifs of esc <dig> are sufficient for targeted silencing
the esc <dig> hybrid protein isolated in our targeted silencing screen was full-length  <cit>  and therefore contained all six predicted brct motifs. to determine which part of esc <dig> and which brct motifs were responsible for the sir-dependent targeted silencing, we constructed three gbd hybrids: one to the n-terminal four brct motifs , one to the linker between the n- and c-terminal sets of motifs , and one to the c-terminal two brct motifs . these constructs were tested for targeted silencing in a strain harboring deletions of the e and b sites  and in a sir2Δ derivative of that strain . significant targeted silencing was observed by gbd-esc4c, although it was not as much as with full-length esc <dig>  the observed silencing by gbd-esc4c was sir-dependent, as observed for the full-length protein . no significant silencing was seen with esc4n or with the linker region, esc4l .

the c-terminal brct motifs of esc <dig> interact with sir3
because the c-terminal two brct motifs of esc <dig> gave targeted silencing, we suspected that this region of the protein was binding to a silencing protein to recruit the sir complex. using a lexa-esc4c hybrid and the two-hybrid reporter strain l <dig>  <cit> , we tested for two-hybrid interactions with several gal <dig> activation domain -silencing protein constructs, including sir <dig>  sir <dig>  sir <dig>  sir <dig> and rap <dig>  <cit> . a strong interaction  with gad-sir <dig>  was identified, as well as a weaker interaction with gad-sir <dig>  . none was detected with sir <dig>  sir <dig> or rap <dig>  because the gad-sir <dig>  hybrid contained the region known to bind to sir <dig>  <cit> , we hypothesized that lexa-esc <dig> was binding to gad-sir <dig> via a bridge of endogenous sir <dig>  to test this, we used a derivative of strain l <dig> harboring a sir3Δ mutation and examined the lexa-esc <dig> interaction with gad-sir <dig>  in this case, the interaction with gad-sir <dig> was no longer observed, whereas the interaction with gad-sir <dig> and an unrelated two-hybrid control interaction were unaffected . when a sir4Δ derivative of l <dig> was used, no change in the lexa-esc <dig> interactions with gad-sir <dig> or gad-sir <dig> was observed, further supporting the idea that esc <dig> requires sir <dig> to interact with sir <dig>  and not vice versa. taken together, the targeted silencing data strongly suggest an interaction  between the c-terminal brct motifs and the silencing protein sir <dig> 

the n-terminal four brct motifs of esc <dig> bind to slx4
the above results indicated that esc <dig> caused sir-dependent targeted silencing primarily by binding to sir <dig> through its c-terminal two brct motifs. in addition, esc <dig> also contains four brct motifs at its n-terminus and these brct motifs are more similar to those found in various proteins from diverse eukaryotes . in order to identify proteins that bind to these n-terminal brct motifs, a two-hybrid screen was performed using a lexa-esc4n  fusion protein. strikingly, from screening ~ <dig> ×  <dig> library plasmids expressing gad protein hybrids, thirteen clones containing in-frame fusions of gad to slx <dig> were identified . in-frame gad fusions to the six different positions in slx <dig> were isolated  and all contained at least the c-terminal half of the protein . the esc4n-slx4c two-hybrid interaction was a very strong one and was specific. also, slx <dig> did not show an interaction with esc4c. thus, the n-terminal brct motifs of esc <dig> are not only necessary for binding slx <dig>  as reported while this manuscript was in preparation  <cit> , but are indeed sufficient for this interaction in vivo. furthermore, our two-hybrid data show that the region of slx <dig> sufficient for esc <dig> binding resides in its c-terminus.

genetic and phenotypic analysis of esc4
a heterozygous diploid strain with a complete deletion of esc <dig> was constructed and dissected to generate a null mutant haploid. this esc4Δ mutant grew normally and also mated with normal efficiency . furthermore, when an esc4Δ mutation was introduced into a strain with a telomere reporter gene, no telomeric silencing defect was seen . thus, although esc <dig> binds to sir <dig>  esc <dig> does not appear to be a protein required for sir protein-mediated silencing.

the brct motif was originally identified in the human brca <dig> tumor suppressor protein  <cit> . brca <dig> functions in dna repair and dna damage-sensing in cell cycle checkpoints . as shown in figure  <dig>  strains deleted for esc <dig> grew significantly less well than wild type on medium containing either mms or hu. this result confirms reports that have since been published  <cit> , as does our observation that esc4Δ mutants are not sensitive to ultraviolet radiation  <cit>  .

as shown in figure  <dig>  like esc4Δ mutants, slx4Δ mutants were sensitive to  <dig> % mms. furthermore, the esc4Δ slx4Δ double mutant did not exhibit a greater mms sensitivity than either single mutant , suggesting that they cooperate in providing resistance to mms. another group reported that an esc4Δ slx4Δ double mutant was more sensitive than either single mutant but the difference was very slight  <cit> . in contrast, an esc4Δ, but not a slx4Δ mutant, was significantly hu-sensitive, and the double mutant was no more sensitive than the esc4Δ strain. thus, esc <dig> appears to act independently of slx <dig> in providing resistance to hu.

because esc <dig> bound to slx <dig> and because the mutant was sensitive to mms, this suggested that esc <dig> might function in the same pathway as slx <dig>  slx <dig> was first identified in a screen for genes required for viability of yeast cells deleted for sgs <dig>  <cit> . therefore, we tested if esc <dig> was also synthetically lethal with sgs <dig>  to do this, an esc4Δ mutant was crossed with an sgs1Δ mutant, the diploid was sporulated and dissected and meiotic progeny were analyzed. haploid esc4Δ sgs1Δ cells were viable, but were noticeably slower-growing that either single mutant . while this work was in progress, this genetic interaction was also observed in genome-wide studies  <cit> .

an sgs1Δ mutant showed sensitivity to both mms and hu , as expected based on previously published results. an asf1Δ mutant was used as a control and displayed sensitivity to both dna damaging chemicals, as expected  <cit> . interestingly, an esc4Δ sgs1Δ mutant displayed mms and hu sensitivity that was much more pronounced than that of either single mutant . the enhanced sensitivity of this double mutant  seemed to be due to a synergistic repair defect and not entirely due to the growth defect  that was also observed in the esc4Δ sgs1Δ strain.

discussion
by screening a library of factors that could function in place of the hmr-e silencer when targeted to dna, we identified esc <dig> for its ability to establish silent chromatin  <cit> . protein sequence analysis showed that esc <dig> protein contains six brct motifs; four are found in tandem at the amino-terminus and two more are at the carboxy-terminus. the entire esc <dig> protein was present in the hybrid identified in the targeted silencing screen. since targeted silencing by esc <dig> at hmr was found to be sir-dependent, it seemed likely that some region within esc <dig> was attracting a silencing protein complex to dna. we tested subsets of the brct motifs, as well as the linker between them, for targeted silencing at hmr. these experiments demonstrated that the c-terminal two brcts caused targeted silencing that was nearly as strong as with full-length esc <dig>  because silencing by this pair of brct motifs of esc <dig> was also sir-dependent, it seemed very likely that this region was recruiting a sir protein when tethered to dna. therefore, we tested the c-terminal brct motifs for interactions with known silencing proteins by two-hybrid analysis. we identified a specific interaction with sir <dig> . we conclude that binding of sir <dig> by esc <dig> is likely to be responsible for the sir-dependent targeted silencing activity.

in some cases brct motifs have been shown to bind to phosphorylated serine residues. specifically, they have been shown to bind to phosphopeptides with the following consensus: psxxf  <cit> . interestingly, sir <dig> has an sxxf sequence  within the esc4-interacting region that we describe here  and, furthermore, sir <dig> protein has been shown to be phosphorylated  <cit> , suggesting that an esc <dig> brct motif or perhaps the combination of the two in the c-terminus may bind to phospho-sir <dig>  however, not all proteins bound by brct motifs have the sxxf motif  <cit> , so the precise brct-interacting region of sir <dig> could be elsewhere.

in addition to binding sir <dig> via c-terminal tandem brct motifs, esc <dig> also binds to slx <dig> via four tandem n-terminal brcts, as we have shown here by two-hybrid screening. this two-hybrid result demonstrates that these four brcts are sufficient for binding slx <dig> and agrees with a recent report showing that the n-terminal brct motifs are required for this interaction  <cit> . it seems quite possible that esc <dig> could bind sir <dig> and slx <dig> concurrently, given that these nuclear proteins' binding sites within esc <dig> map to brct clusters separated by a long linker. slx <dig> has been shown to heterodimerize with the endonuclease slx <dig> to cleave dna containing 5' -flap structures, such as in stalled replication forks, to facilitate their repair  <cit> . thus, esc <dig> binds the silencing protein sir <dig> and also to slx <dig>  an important dna repair complex component. esc <dig> may play a role in facilitating repair of aberrant dna structures, perhaps specifically within silent chromatin. esc <dig> is a mec <dig> kinase target  <cit>  and this phosphorylation is required for its repair function. it is possible that phosphorylation of esc <dig> by mec <dig>  which occurs just n-terminal to the sir3-binding brcts, regulates association with sir <dig> or other factors required for its ability to repair particular chromosomal loci in s phase.

we analyzed esc <dig> protein alignments  for evidence of conserved regions in the protein other than brct motifs. one region of interest was the sq/tq motifs between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig>  which were shown to be important for function in dna repair  <cit> . we did not find that these motifs were well-conserved, suggesting that the specific site of phosphorylation is not particularly critical in proteins with otherwise similar overall brct domain architecture . this may be because of some differences in esc <dig> functions in diverse yeasts or may suggest that flexibility is tolerated in positioning of the phosphorylation sites, and therefore the exact relative location of kinase target sites has not been constrained during evolution.

future structural and genome sequencing studies are likely to unveil similarities and differences between multi-brct domain containing proteins. whether these proteins play largely protein-scaffolding roles or also contain intrinsic enzymatic properties will be interesting to discover.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that esc <dig> caused targeted silencing when tethered at a weakened hmr locus. the targeted silencing activity was primarily due to the c-terminal two tandem brct motifs in esc <dig>  which bound to sir <dig>  probably through a direct interaction. this interaction led to the recruitment of the sir complex and hence caused targeted silencing. the n-terminal brct domains were sufficient for binding to slx <dig>  which functions with esc <dig> in dna repair. thus, the nuclear esc <dig> protein uses its six brct motifs to connect diverse proteins involved in dna repair and silent chromatin.
