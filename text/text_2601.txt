BACKGROUND
genome sequence determination of the model organism drosophila melanogaster was a landmark that launched a new era for functional genomic studies in complex organisms. the almost complete version of the euchromatic dna sequence was first released in march  <dig> due to a collaborative effort of the drosophila genome projects and celera genomics  <cit> . using gene prediction softwares in combination with searches of protein and est databases, initial in silico analyses indicated the existence of  <dig>  protein-coding genes , an extraordinarily small number of genes when compared to the approximately  <dig>  pcg encoded in the c.elegans genome  <cit> .

after the release  <dig>  an intensive collective work took place in order to improve sequence quality and annotation, fill in the gaps, and correct the assembly. with the aim of generating the information necessary to define the transcripts encoded in the genome, the berkeley drosophila genome project  initiated a high throughput production of both est and full length cdna sequences based on conventional and normalized cdna libraries from different tissues and developmental stages  <cit> . this effort was followed by non-bdgp projects with a major contribution from the exelixis drosophila melanogaster est project, which has adopted sequencing of random primed libraries of mixed stage embryos, imaginal disks, and adult heads to increase the transcription units coverage  <cit> . currently, there are about  <dig>  full length mrna and  <dig>  est sequences available in the ncbi database, totalizing approximately  <dig>  clusters according to unigene  <cit> . since the year  <dig>  several subsequent genome versions have been released, each one improved by bdgp and annotated by flybase  <cit> . release  <dig> , considered the first finished version, was published in march  <dig> and provided a complete revision of all gene models and other genome features  <cit> , estimating a total number of  <dig>  pcgs plus  <dig> non-protein coding genes . release  <dig> , the last annotated genome version published in march  <dig>  includes a total of  <dig>  genes and is available for searches by gene annotation, blast or sequence id at the flybase website  <cit> .

during the last few years, an enthusiastic debate about the number of pcgs in the organisms with sequenced genomes has arisen. for d. melanogaster, estimates varied from the initial ~  <dig>  coding gene predictions  <cit>  to about  <dig>  gene predictions, based on microarray expression data  <cit> . a careful computational and experimental analysis carried to validate the drosophila genome annotation has recently concluded that the d.melanogaster genome in fact contains approximately  <dig>  protein-coding genes, although some genes presenting unusual features that make them refractory to prediction methods may remain to be discovered  <cit> . however, the truthful notion about the complexity of the d. melanogaster transcriptome is still under construction. in this respect, it has been inferred from dna oligonucleotide microarrays, with unique sequences tiled throughout the genome and across predicted splice junctions, that over 40% of the drosophila genes contain one or more alternative exons  <cit> . additionally, a transcription map with a  <dig> bp resolution of the initial  <dig> hours of development indicates that 30% of the transcribed regions are still unannotated. approximately 23% of these are intronic and 7% correspond to intergenic regions. based on manual and computational surveys designed to identify coregulated expression patterns between unannotated and annotated genome regions, it was estimated that 29% of the unannotated regions are part of transcripts incompletely annotated or potential alternative exons of known genes  <cit> . therefore, correcting and refining the genome annotation is a reiterative task, which is continuously being done and depends on experimental data for final validation, especially for the identification of rare transcripts and alternative splice variants. with the aim of covering the diversity of transcripts expressed in drosophila the generation of est information from different sources is currently under way  <cit> .

here we use the open reading frame expressed sequence tags  methodology, which is based on low stringency rt-pcr, to generate d. melanogaster expressed sequence information. orestes are preferentially derived from the central coding portions of the transcript and frequently identify less abundant messages  <cit> . such approach was previously applied for human transcriptome characterization, validating a large percentage of genes and identifying  <dig> unannotated transcribed sequences on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . more recently, a large-scale analysis of orestes derived from head, neck and thyroid tumors pointed to  <dig> putative new alternative splicing isoforms. a subset of  <dig> was submitted to experimental validation resulting in the confirmation of  <dig>  new alternate exons  <cit> .

analysis of  <dig>  drosophila orestes clusters revealed  <dig> potential transcribed regions unannotated in the current version of the genome . experimental validation of  <dig>  of this unannotated orestes revealed  <dig> new exons that most likely belong to low abundance transcripts. using the orestes information together with a pcr based approach we obtained the complete coding sequence of a new serine protease which mrna expression is induced upon infection. our data reinforce the importance of pcr based methodologies for refining the drosophila transcriptome, particularly for the identification of previously unannotated low copy transcripts.

RESULTS
orestes in silico analysis
of  <dig>  drosophila orestes clusters from different developmental stages of d.melanogaster,  <dig> were identified as unannotated in the genome release  <dig> . we re-analysed this set of  <dig> orestes against the current annotated version of the genome . sixty-eight of these clusters aligned in unannotated genome regions indicating putative new exons . fifty-three out of the  <dig> clusters either match or overlap ests generated by other projects  <cit> , suggesting that they indeed represent true transcripts. amongst the remaining clusters,  <dig> overlap annotated exons represented by cloned cdnas and ests,  <dig> correspond to transposons or repetitive sequences and  <dig> are chimeric. about half of the  <dig> unannotated orestes  were selected for validation by developmental northern blot hybridization.

50% of the unannotated exons detected by orestes belong to low abundance transcripts
of the  <dig> orestes that mapped in unannotated exons of the version  <dig>  of the genome,  <dig>  detected mrnas only in polya+ northern blots  indicating that they all represent low abundance mrnas. the other  <dig> ests could also represent transcribed regions that cannot be detected by our analysis, such as precursors of small non-coding rnas  <cit> . among the  <dig> validated orestes,  <dig> are derived from the embryo library ,  <dig> are from the library constructed with rna extracted from larvae, prepupae plus pupae ,  <dig> are from an adult library  and  <dig> are from a library constructed with a mixture of the rna from all developmental stages . based on these data and in the number of orestes clusters produced from the de , dl , da  and dp  libraries, the estimated discovery rate of new exons for each library was  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  new exons per  <dig>  orestes from the de, dl, da and dp libraries, respectively. the 5– <dig> higher discovery rate found for de library indicates that, despite the large amount of embryo ests available in the public database, the embryonic transcriptome needs further sequencing for its definition, which is in accordance with previous transcriptional analysis of the drosophila embryogenesis performed at the genomic scale  <cit> .

the majority of the validated orestes  detected a single band in northen blots, which could indicate the presence of unique transcripts. three orestes detected more than one mrna species , which could either constitute isoforms of the same gene or mrnas encoded by different genes sharing common exons. ten of these  <dig> validated orestes detected transcripts in all analysed developmental stages, namely: embryo, larvae and adult . the other seven  detected stage specific transcripts. ore- <dig> and ore- <dig> detect mrnas of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, respectively, which are mainly expressed in embryos. the  <dig>  kb mrna detected by ore- <dig> is abundant in embryos and present in lower amounts in adults. ore- <dig> detects an  <dig>  kb transcript present mainly in embryo and adults. the transcripts of about  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb detected by ore- <dig> and ore- <dig>  respectively, were only detected in larvae and adults. ore- <dig> detects a  <dig>  kb mrna present at higher levels in larvae that is also expressed in embryos. ore- <dig> detected one mrna of about  <dig>  kb exclusively expressed in embryos, and a  <dig>  kb mrna present at all stages. ore- <dig> detected three mrnas of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb. the  <dig>  kb mrna is mainly detected in larvae; the  <dig>  kb rna is much more abundant in embryos, but also detected in adults; and the  <dig>  kb rna is exclusively expressed in adults. ore- <dig> detected  <dig> different transcripts of about  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, all of them observed in adult flies.

altogether, our orestes analyses resulted in the validation of  <dig> novel exons. of these, five ests constitute, up to now, the unique expressed sequence information for the corresponding genomic regions , despite the wealth of cdna data available for drosophila, and the ongoing projects of cdna/est generation using tissue specific and normalized cdna libraries  <cit> . both strands of the longest est representing each one of the  <dig> validated orestes clusters were sequenced. alignment of these complete sequences with the drosophila genome show that  <dig> of them map to intergenic regions,  <dig> map to introns of annotated genes, two align in intron/exon boundaries and another partially overlaps the last exon of an annotated gene . with the exception of ore- <dig>  that lies more than  <dig> kb from the closest annotated gene, the other orestes mapping in intergenic regions  are located less than  <dig> kb of the last exon of the nearest gene, and could represent a novel alternate 3'utr of these genes. if this were the case, the novel isoforms would be larger than the annotated transcripts since their sizes are much shorter than the detected mrnas. ore- <dig> overlaps the last exon of the cg <dig>  whose cds is incomplete, and therefore could represent an extension of this gene. additionally, ore- <dig> detected three transcripts longer than the cg <dig> predicted transcript, indicating that this gene might express different mrna isoforms. of the five orestes located in introns, four  detected mrnas shorter than the transcripts mapped in the same region and could represent exons of other isoforms. ore- <dig> and ore- <dig> map to an exon-intron boundary of electronically predicted genes and could either represent a different isoform or the correct structure of the transcription units. however, since orestes are not strand-specific, they can also represent exons of unannotated genes encoded in the opposite strand of the same genomic region. interestingly, all the new annotated exons belong to low abundance messages confirming the ability of orestes in identifying rare new transcripts  <cit> .

cloning a new d. melanogaster serine-protease – sp212
although representing partial transcripts, orestes information can be useful in the process of transcriptome finishing  <cit> . here we illustrate this potential by cloning a cdna, which we could not isolate after several attempts of screening cdna libraries. the chosen transcript was first detected by ore- <dig> that maps in an intron/exon boundary of a computationally predicted gene . based on the sequence of ore- <dig>  together with the exons and the genomic sequences flanking this genomic region, we designed primers with the aim of amplifying fragments covering at least the full coding sequence  of the gene . we have generated  <dig> overlapping fragments, derived from the same transcript, that were completely sequenced producing a consensus sequence of  <dig>  nt . this transcript presents  <dig> exons, as for the cg <dig> predicted transcript, but the third exon is longer in the cloned cdna . despite several attempts using mrna from animals at all developmental stages we could not confirm the existence of the predicted cg <dig> and we suggest that the cloned sequence probably represents the correct transcription unit of cg <dig>  this consensus has an open reading frame of  <dig>  nt encoding a  <dig> amino acids polypeptide . the deduced protein has an estimated molecular weight of  <dig>  kda and an isoeletric point of  <dig> . using blastx tool we found that this polypeptide presents significant identity with serine proteases , thus revealing a new d. melanogaster sp protein.

sp proteins are proteolytic enzymes that require serine for their catalytic activity. they are ubiquitous peptidases, which perform a wide array of important physiological functions, including digestion, blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, cellular and humoral immunity, fertilization and embryonic development  <cit> . in a previous work that intended to map all sps and sp related proteins in the genome of d. melanogaster, ross and colleagues  <cit>  performed a series of similarity searches  and found a total of  <dig> genbank entries encoding sps and sphs . following the nomenclature criteria used by these authors, we named the additional sp gene characterized here as sp <dig>  prosite analysis  <cit>  revealed that d. melanogaster sp <dig> presents the conserved catalytic triad ordered his, asp, ser , a characteristic of sp chymotrypsin family. these residues form two diads, ser-his and his-asp, that operate in concert for the acyl mechanism of catalysis  <cit> . these catalytic residues are, as in most sps, embedded into highly conserved motifs: saahc, dial and gdsggg. sp <dig> also presents the signal peptide sequence in its amino terminal end with the cleavage between residues  <dig> and  <dig>  an indication that this peptidase might be secreted .

the sp <dig> gene is located in a chromosomal region  that contains three predicted genes, cg <dig>  cg <dig> and cg <dig>  which codify two sps and one sph respectively, named: sp <dig>  sp <dig> and sph <dig>  in order to evaluate the similarity level between sp <dig> and related proteins, we performed a multiple alignment comparison with a selected group of sps and sphs. the protein sequences for this alignment were selected based on their similarity  with sp <dig> using the blastx tool. multiple alignment  <cit>  of the catalytic domain of these proteins  showed that sp <dig> is more closely related to sp <dig> and sph <dig>  which are located in the 88a12-b <dig> chromossomic region. thus, sp <dig>  sp <dig> and sph <dig> genes were possibly generated through gene duplication during evolution of the sp family, probably being derived from a common ancestor .

sp <dig> gene is upregulated in response to infection
sp <dig> is  <dig> amino acid residues long and presents the potential to form three disulfide-bridges. these structural features of sp <dig> indicate that this enzyme is probably associated with physiological functions other than digestion. digestive sps are much smaller, contain approximately  <dig> amino acid residues and have a relatively simpler structure, with a short amino-terminal activation peptide connected to a catalytic domain. additional domains in larger enzymes allow protein-protein interactions, which are usually needed for regulating their activity and specific localization. the presence of a disulfide-bridge structure, called the clip domain, for example, is characteristic of arthropod sps and sphs that are involved in defense response and embryonic development  <cit> . interestingly, data of high-density oligonucleotide microarrays assaying nearly every drosophila gene indicated that the sp <dig>  sp <dig> and sph <dig> encoding genes, mapped at the locus 88a12-b <dig> , are all upregulated upon septic injury with a mixture of gram-negative  and gram-positive  bacteria, or to natural infection with the entomopathogenic fungus b.bassiana  <cit> . additionally, there are evidences that cg <dig>  is controlled by toll and cg <dig>  by both toll and imd signalling pathways  <cit> , the major regulators of immune response in d. melanogaster. these observations lead to the suggestion that sp <dig>  which is localized in the same genomic cluster, could also be involved in defense responses. to test this hypothesis we analysed the effect of aseptic injury and septic injuries with gram-positive  and gram-negative  bacteria and fungi  on the sp <dig> levels of expression at different time points after the injuries. as shown in figure  <dig>  we observed that the amounts of sp <dig> mrna increase upon infection, with the highest levels being detected  <dig> hours after injuries with either bacteria or fungi. the increase of sp <dig> mrna amounts is also observed after aseptic pricking, albeit in lower amounts than in the animals challenged with microorganisms, similarly to what has been previously described for antimicrobial peptide genes  <cit> . therefore, the sp <dig> gene and the genes encoding the other three serine proteases mapped in the locus 88a12-b <dig> seem to be co-regulated in response to injury and probably have a role in d. melanosgaster defense against pathogens. recent genetic  <cit>  and in vivo rnai studies  <cit>  have provided information about the role of ten drosophila sp/sph in septic injury. to our knowledge no further functional studies about the sp/sph clustered in the 88a12-b <dig> chromosome region have been reported so far. it will be important to characterize the injury-response elements involved in this locus activation as well as to determine the function of these new enzymes in the defense response.

CONCLUSIONS
the analysis of a relatively small set of orestes allowed the validation of  <dig> novel exons present in low abundance transcripts, and led to the cloning of a new serine peptidase that is induced during the defense response. these results illustrate the importance of pcr-based approaches as complementary tools for the identification of transcribed regions in sequenced genomes. the final determination of any transcriptome is not a trivial task and one might envisage the occurrence of rare transcripts that will be missed by conventional cloning.
