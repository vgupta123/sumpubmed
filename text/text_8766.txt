BACKGROUND
in rat, deafferentation of one labyrinth  results in a characteristic syndrome of ocular motor and postural disorders. these disorders have been divided into two categories : one category of symptoms, called static, includes head rotation in both the frontal and horizontal planes and ocular nystagmus  <cit> . the other category, called dynamic, corresponds to a decreased gain of the vestibulo-ocular and vestibulo-spinal refelxes  <cit> . behavioral recovery , encompassing  <dig> week after unilateral labyrinthectomy, has been termed vestibular compensation  <cit> . moreover, the time course of recovery is very different for static and dynamic reflexes: static deficits disappear in one week but dynamic deficits tend to take several months to normalize. because unilateral labyrinthectomy results in a permanent loss of vestibular inputs from the lesioned side, the compensatory process is assumed to be attributable to the reorganization of the neural network in the central vestibular system  <cit> . many brain regions including, the medial vestibular nucleus , are implicated in this process of recovery  <cit> .

the focus of our study is the histamine h <dig> receptor that was initially characterized as an autoreceptor controlling histamine synthesis and release  <cit> . subsequently, as a heteroreceptor, the h <dig> receptor was found to mediate presynaptic inhibition of release of histamine, noradrenaline, serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, gaba and tachykinins  <cit> , presumably by inhibiting calcium channels  <cit> . the histamine h <dig> receptor was recently cloned from human  <cit> , monkey  <cit> , rat  <cit> , mouse  <cit> , and guinea pig  <cit> . moreover, the receptor was found to have several isoforms  <cit>  with differential coupling to second messenger systems and a variation in their distribution in a region-specific manner. the isoforms are formed by alternative splicing of the messenger rna . this study involves analysis of trends observed in mrna expression levels for the h <dig> receptor  as well as three of the known functionally active isoforms , described by drutel et al.  <cit> , during the process of post-lesional plasticity in the central nervous system .

the primary source of histamine  are histaminergic perikarya located exclusively in the tuberomammillary nuclei of the posterior hypothalamus  <cit> ; these same neurons send axonal projections to many areas of the brain including the vestibular nuclear complex in rat  <cit> . the fact that the rat vestibular nuclear complex is endowed with the h <dig> receptor was established by use of ligand binding  <cit>  and in situ hybridization methods  <cit> .

evidence suggesting that the h <dig> receptor plays a key role in vestibular compensation comes from studies indicating that betahistine, a histamine-like drug that acts as both a partial histamine h <dig> receptor agonist and an h <dig> receptor antagonist  <cit> , accelerates the process of vestibular compensation  <cit> . furthermore, studies have shown that betahistine treatment results in a reduction of n-Î±-methylhistamine labelling in the vestibular nuclear complex  <cit> ; these findings suggest that betahistine increases histamine turnover and release by blocking presynaptic h <dig> receptors and inducing h <dig> receptor downregulation  <cit> . it is noteworthy that dynamic vestibular functions can be modulated by h <dig> receptor ligands, e.g., thioperamide  <cit> ; moreover, thioperamide can affect tonic vestibular functions as well with its demonstrated ability to attenuate barrel rotation in rats following unilateral labyrinthectomy  <cit> . the forementioned studies make tenable the view that further elucidation of h <dig> receptor regulation is required to fully understand the process of vestibular compensation.

the detailed aim of this study was to characterize the patterning of mrna expression levels for all possible mrna splice variants of the h <dig> receptor  and its isoforms which display different variations of the third intracellular loop  in the medial vestibular nucleus  during the process of vestibular compensation.

moreover, in this study, we compared the aforementioned trend in mrna expression levels with h <dig> receptor binding densities to reveal the possible plastic changes in the h <dig> receptor which is responsible for significant constitutive activity also in vivo  <cit> , histamine-mediated regulation of neurotransmitter release, and therapeutic effects of betahistine.

RESULTS
expression patterns of total h <dig> receptor and h <dig> receptor isoforms 
changes in mrna expression levels for h <dig> receptor and the three h <dig> receptor isoforms  occured bilaterally; that is, there were no significant differences detected between the ipsilateral and contralateral medial vestibular nuclei of animals in all groups studied .

we compared the total h <dig> receptor mrna expression levels  in ipsilateral mve of control animals to that of test animals from the four time points . fig. 2b shows scanned x-ray film depiction of h3x expression in a representative animal  <dig> h post-lesion. we found no significant rise in h3x mrna levels in the ipsilateral mve  <dig> hours after lesioning. significant increases in h3x mrna levels were found to occur at  <dig> and  <dig> hours post-lesion. after  <dig> week post-lesion, h <dig> receptor mrna expression levels  returned to normal levels. the trend observed was similar when comparing h3x mrna levels in contralateral mve of control animals with that of test animals from the four time points. there was no significant change in total h <dig> receptor mrna levels detected in contralateral mve  <dig> hours post-lesion, but we found a significant increase in h3x mrna levels detected in contralateral mve both  <dig> hours and  <dig> hours post-lesion. finally, a return to normal levels in total h3x receptor mrna level was detected in contralateral mve  <dig> week post-lesion.

no significant increases in h3a mrna expression levels were detected when we compared ipsilateral mve in control animals with ipsilateral mve  <dig> hours,  <dig> hours, and  <dig> hours post-lesion . fig. 2d shows scanned x-ray film depiction of h3a expression in a representative animal  <dig> h post-lesion. on the other hand, a significant decrease of h3a mrna levels does occur in the ipsilateral mve  <dig> week after lesioning. the trend was identical when comparing h3a mrna levels in contralateral mve of control animals with h3a mrna levels in contralateral mve of animals from the four time points: there was no significant increase in h3a mrna levels when comparing to contralateral mve  <dig> hours,  <dig> hours, and  <dig> hours post-lesion; on the other hand, there is a significant decrease in h3a mrna levels when comparing to contralateral mve  <dig> week after lesioning.

no significant changes in h3b mrna expression levels were detected when we compared ipsilateral mve in control animals to ipsilateral mve  <dig> hours post-lesion . fig. 2f shows scanned x-ray film depiction of h3b expression in a representative animal  <dig> h post-lesion. significant decreases in mrna levels were found in the ipsilateral mve  <dig> hours,  <dig> hours, and  <dig> week after lesioning. when comparing contralateral mve of control animals to contralateral mve of animals in the other time points, there was a significant increase detected  <dig> hours post-lesion and this was followed by significant decreases detected at  <dig> hours,  <dig> hours after lesion, and  <dig> week post-lesion.

no significant changes in h3c mrna levels were detected when we compared ipsilateral mve in control animals to ipsilateral mve  <dig> hours post-lesion . fig. 2h shows scanned x-ray film depiction of h3c expression in a representative animal  <dig> h post-lesion. a significant increase was detected when comparing ipsilateral mve of control animals to ipsilateral mve  <dig> hours post-lesion; moreover, the decrease in h3c mrna levels in the ipsilateral mve  <dig> hours post-lesion was not significantly different from those of the ipsilateral mve in control animals. finally, in comparison to the ipsilateral mve in controls, there was a decrease in mrna levels that was found to be significant in the ipsilateral mve  <dig> week post-lesion. results were similar when comparing the contralateral mve in control animals to contralateral mve from the other time points: there was no significant increase in h3c mrna levels when comparing to contralateral mve  <dig> hours post-lesion, there was a significant increase detected when comparing to contralateral mve  <dig> hours post-lesion, the decrease was not significant comparing to contralateral mve  <dig> hours post-lesion, and a significant decrease was detected when comparing to contralateral mve  <dig> week post-lesion.

iodoproxyfan binding densities
no significant changes were found in h <dig> receptor binding densities  between ipsilateral mve in control animals  and ipsilateral mve of animals of different time points. the results were identical when h <dig> receptor binding densities in contralateral mve in control animals were compared to that of contralateral mve at different times post-lesion. on the other hand, when comparing the ipsilateral to contralateral mve  <dig> hours post-lesion, a significant increase in binding densities occurred on the ipsilateral side .

discussion
knowing that there is no reliable method to determine the efficiency of a probe for its targetted sequence in an mrna of interest, this study focuses instead on the pattern of expression for the total h <dig> receptor  and its isoforms  occurring during the process of post-lesional plasticity in the cns. moreover, the probes used in this study were designed to detect unique areas in the transcripts , or junctional areas in deletion isoforms  which would make it highly unlikely for non-specific hybridization would occur. this study also includes a comparison of the aforementioned patterns of expression with binding densities for the h <dig> receptor.

the prepositus nuclei are delineated and mentioned in legends for figures  <dig> and  <dig>  these nuclei are delineated for the sole purpose of giving the reader an idea of the dorsoventral extent of the mve at the levels depicted in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  noteworthy, is that these nuclei are not included in the main functional projections in the vestibulo-ocular and vestibulo-spinal pathways from the brainstem vestibular nucleus in mammals reviewed by smith and curthoys  <cit> .

there are three previously described types of neurons in the medial vestibular nucleus  <cit> ; in vitro, all three types are depolarized by histamine  <cit> . moreover, this depolarization has been shown to be exclusively mediated through postsynaptic h <dig> receptors  <cit>  suggesting a presynaptic localization of h <dig> receptors in the medial vestibular nuclei  <cit> . consequently, there are three possible locations for h <dig> receptors in the mve: 1) on the histaminergic or other incoming fibers innervating the mve  <cit> . 2) on terminals of the inhibitory interneurons in the mve that make synaptic contacts on second order excitatory neurons-defined as neurons in the vestibular nuclei that receive inputs from sensory afferents  <cit> . 3) on the terminals of second order excitatory mve neurons making cross-commissural synaptic contacts on contralateral mve inhibitory interneurons  <cit> . with respect to mve on the lesioned side, an h <dig> receptor mediated inhibition of gaba release from inhibitory interneurons or glutamate release from terminals of second order excitatory mve neurons may underlie the restoration of resting activity in the deafferentated mve; more precisely, h <dig> receptor action would result in disinhibition of neurons in the deafferentated mve

with respect to the first possible location, it has been established that histamine fibers are endowed with h <dig> receptors that function as autoreceptors and inhibit histamine release  <cit> . support for the notion that h <dig> receptors are at the next two possible locations  comes from work showing that betahistine antagonizes the excitatory effect of histamine on vestibular neurons from in vitro slice preparations of the dorsal brainstem of the rat  <cit> . this finding is significant given that h <dig> receptors mediate presynaptic inhibition of release of other neurotransmitters including: noradrenaline, serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, gaba and tachykinins  <cit> . unilateral labyrinthectomy induced changes in expression levels of receptors for glutamate  have been studied in the vestibular nuclei. moreover, the existence of both gabaa and gabab receptors in the vestibular nuclei and their involvement in vestibular compensation has been demonstrated by either unilateral perfusion or microinjection of gabaergic agonists and antagonists   <cit> .

consequently, an h <dig> receptor antagonist such as betahistine could either facilitate gaba release from inhibitory interneurons located in the mve that make synaptic contacts with second order neurons or facilitate glutamate release from terminals of second order mve neurons that synapse on inhibitory interneurons in the contralateral mve  <cit> . either scenario would lead to an inhibition of second order neurons in the mve and this would explain the observation that betahistine antagonizes the excitatory effect of histamine on vestibular neurons  <cit> .

on the other hand, betahistine administration is reported to induce recovery with a time benefit of  <dig> weeks relative to control animals after unilateral vestibular neurectomy  <cit> ; this is thought to be due to a bilateral increase in histamine release in the mve  <cit> . the increased histamine would be bound by h <dig> receptors on the perikarya of mve neurons ipsilateral and contralateral to the lesion resulting in a bilateral increase in activity. this should facilitate behavioral recovery as it is thought that an imbalance in discharge of mve neurons  ipsilateral and contralateral to the lesion underlies the static postural and occulomotor deficits triggered by unilateral labyrinthectomy  <cit> . yet, as stated before, the actions of betahistine would also extend to h <dig> receptors located on glutamatergic terminals of contralateral mve neurons or on gabaergic terminals of inhibitory mve interneurons. antagonism of h <dig> receptors at either site may also act to speed recovery by increasing the amount of gaba output from terminals of inhibitory interneurons and, as a consequence, equalizing neuronal discharge activity of ipsilateral and contralateral mve.

the trends toward bilateral increases  followed by decreases  in total h <dig> receptor and h3a, and h3c isoform mrna levels, with h3b mrna levels already increasing at  <dig> hours post-lesion and decreasing at  <dig> h post-lesion, coinciding with a significant increase in h <dig> receptor binding densities in the ipsilateral mve detected  <dig> hours post-lesion suggests the occurrence of one or a combination of events in the ipsilateral mve: 1) an increase in translation has occurred. 2) a change in receptor trafficking between intracellular stores and cell membrane has occurred so that it can be detected as an increase in h <dig> receptor receptor binding densities. in either case, an increase in functional h <dig> receptor protein coupled with an increase in receptor activity may lead to a restoration of resting activity in the deafferentated mve by scenarios already mentioned in this section.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings are significant given that normalization of resting activities in neurons located in the ipsilateral mve has been shown to occur  <dig> hours after unilateral labyrinthectomy  <cit> . moreover, by  <dig> hours post-lesion, commissural disinhibition has been observed to occur  <cit> . placement of h <dig> receptors at the terminals of either gabaergic inhibitory mve interneurons or on terminals of glutamatergic second order mve neurons with contralateral projections should result in the observed commissural disinhibition as increased h <dig> receptor activity would result in an inhibition of synaptic release of neurotransmitters.

our data would thus suggest that h <dig> receptors are involved in presynaptic mechanisms resulting in a normalization of resting activities in ipsilateral mve neurons which would balance discharge activity in mve on both sides.
