BACKGROUND
the multiple cell types that make up the adult pancreas, including endocrine, exocrine and ductal cells, derive from a common pool of pancreatic progenitors. pancreatic development in mice begins at embryonic day  <dig>   with the formation of two epithelial buds on the dorsal and ventral side of the primitive gut endoderm  <cit> . epithelial cells within the pancreatic buds proliferate rapidly and branch out during later embryonic days to form a complex tubular network comprised of undifferentiated multipotent progenitor cells  <cit> . starting at e <dig> , the expanded pancreatic epithelial cells undergo an asynchronized wave of differentiation to give rise to all the differentiated cell types of the adult pancreas, including acinar cells that produce hydrolytic digestive enzymes and islet cells that secrete endocrine hormones  <cit> . pancreatic morphogenesis depends on a complex and yet incompletely characterized network of transcription factors. significant efforts have been made in the past few years to understand the role of several important transcription factors, including pdx <dig>  <cit> , ptf1a  <cit> , sox <dig>  <cit>  <dig>  ngn <dig>  <cit> , neurod <dig>  <cit> , pax <dig>  <cit> , pax <dig>  <cit> , nkx <dig>   <cit> , nkx <dig>   <cit> , arx  <cit> , isl <dig>  <cit>  and insm <dig>  <cit> . it is generally accepted that these transcription factors coordinate pancreatic morphogenesis by functioning in concert to restrict the developmental potentials of the pancreatic progenitors in a spatial and stage-specific manner  <cit> .

several previous studies have underscored the importance of notch-mediated signaling in regulating pancreatic cell proliferation and cell fate decisions through control of ngn <dig> gene expression. during pancreatic development, ngn <dig> is transiently expressed in a subset of the pancreatic epithelial cells. ngn <dig> deficiency completely abolishes formation of all the endocrine cell subtypes, suggesting ngn <dig> functions as a master switch for the endocrine lineage in the pancreas. mutations in genes encoding notch signaling pathway components, such as dll <dig> , rbp-jk , or hes- <dig>  causes expansion of ngn <dig> expression in pancreatic cells and, as a result, accelerated differentiation of endocrine cells at the expense of acinar and ductal cells  <cit> . conversely, over or persistent expression of the notch intracellular domain , a constitutively active form of notch receptors, or the notch effector gene hes <dig> results in diminished expression of ngn <dig> and attenuated differentiation of endocrine cells  <cit> . these studies suggest that during pancreatic development notch signaling controls the endocrine and exocrine cell fate decisions of pancreatic epithelial cells by directly regulating ngn <dig> expression. recent studies have also indicated the importance of notch signaling in control of exocrine cell differentiation. ectopic expression of activated notch- <dig> prevents or significantly delays differentiation of acinar cells  <cit> .

while the role of notch signaling in control of pancreatic cell proliferation and cell fate decisions is clearly recognized, the molecular mechanisms necessary for proper control of notch signaling during vertebrate pancreatic development are poorly understood. genetic and biochemical studies in invertebrates suggest that regulation of notch signaling occurs at various levels and through multiple mechanisms  <cit> . these include stochastic and/or developmental expression of the notch receptors and their ligands  <cit> , selective receptor-ligand interactions  <cit> , intracellular protein trafficking  <cit>  and stability of nicd  <cit> . suppressor enhancer lin <dig>  <dig> like  encodes a cytoplasmic protein that is highly conserved throughout the vertebrate kingdom  <cit> . rna in situ hybridization and immunohistological analysis revealed that sel1l is highly expressed in both the embryonic and adult pancreas  <cit> . the human sel1l gene is located in a chromosome region that is in close proximity to a type  <dig> diabetes high risk locus, iddm- <dig> , prompting the speculation that mutations in sel1l may be associated with the pathogenesis of type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> . sel- <dig>  the c. elegans ortholog of sel1l, was first identified in a genetic screen for mutations that suppress lin-12/notch activity  <cit> . subsequent biochemical studies demonstrated that sel- <dig> negatively regulates lin-12/notch activity by controlling lin-12/notch turn-over  <cit> . based on these findings, it has been suggested that sel1l may also function as a negative regulator for notch signaling  <cit> . recent biochemical and molecular studies in vitro revealed that sel1l is also required for maintaining homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum . sel1l nucleates an er membrane protein complex that is required for dislocation of unfolded or misfolded proteins from the er lumen into the cytosol for degradation  <cit> .

in an attempt to decipher the developmental and physiological roles of sel1l, we have generated and characterized mice carrying a gene trap mutation in the sel1l gene. we report here that sel1l expression during pancreas development coincides with differentiation of pancreatic epithelial cells into both the endocrine and exocrine lineages. homozygous sel1l mutant embryos exhibit an impaired pancreatic epithelial growth and branching morphology. pharmacological inhibition of notch signaling rescues the pancreatic phenotype of sel1l-deficient embryos. these data are consistent with the notion that sel1l functions as a negative regulator for notch signaling during pancreatic organogenesis  <cit> .

RESULTS
sel1l expression during mouse pancreatic development
we generated mice carrying a gene-trap insertion in the sel1l gene. the gene trap cassette, located in intron  <dig>  contains a β-galactosidase-neomycin  fusion reporter gene. to determine the spatiotemporal expression pattern of sel1l in the developing mouse pancreas, we performed immunohistological analysis of pancreatic sections from sel1l+/βgeo embryos using antibodies against β-galactosidase  and several pancreatic proteins, including sox <dig> and pdx <dig> , insulin and glucagon  and amylase . βgal expression was first detected at e <dig>  in a small number of cells located within the core of sox9-expressing pancreatic epithelium . the βgal+ cells at e <dig>  express either glucagon  or insulin , indicating that they were early endocrine cells. βgal expression expands significantly between e <dig>  and e <dig> . at e <dig> , differential βgal expression was detected in the pdx1+ cells throughout the pancreatic epithelium . epithelial cells with markedly lower βgal expression correspond to a subset of pdx1+ cells that express sox <dig> . at e <dig> , high βgal expression was detected in the core of the differentiating pancreas . these βgal+ cells were positive either for glucagon or insulin . at birth, βgal expression was detected in both islet and acinar cells . taken together, these expression data indicate that sel1l is selectively expressed in the differentiating or differentiated pancreatic epithelial cells.

sel1l deficiency results in defective pancreatic epithelial growth and branching morphogenesis
the gene trap in sel1l contains a strong splicing acceptor signal that efficiently blocks splicing between exon  <dig> and  <dig>  resulting in a truncated sel1l transcript. homozygous gene trap mice  exhibit systemic endoplasmic reticulum stress and die before e <dig>  to e <dig>  . to determine if sel1l is required for pancreatic epithelial growth, we performed morphometrical analysis of the developing pancreas of viable sel1lβgeo/βgeo embryos. at e <dig> , the dorsal and ventral pancreatic buds in sel1lβgeo/βgeo embryos appeared to be closely linked , as compared to those in wild-type embryos . there was no significant difference in the pancreatic epithelial size between wild-type and sel1lβgeo/βgeo embryos . at e <dig> , the dorsal pancreatic bud of sel1lβgeo/βgeo embryos  was clearly smaller than that of wild-type embryos . in addition, while wild-type pancreatic epithelium displayed a well-branched structure, mutant pancreatic epithelium appeared to be a simple tube of epithelial cells. tunel assays revealed no significant increase of apoptosis in the developing pancreas of sel1l mutant embryos . immunostaining using anti-pcna  antibody indicated that the pancreatic epithelium of sel1l mutant embryos had a significantly lower rate of cell proliferation than wild-type pancreatic epithelium . together, these results indicate that sel1l, while dispensable for pancreatic epithelial induction, is essential for the subsequent growth and branching morphogenesis of the pancreatic epithelial cells.

sel1l deficiency inhibits differentiation of acinar cells and significantly attenuates differentiation of endocrine cells
we next investigated the role of sel1l in pancreatic epithelial cell differentiation. since the first wave of cell differentiation occurs before e <dig>  and the cells generated are mostly α-cells, we analyzed glucagon expression in e <dig>  sel1lβgeo/βgeo embryos. as shown in fig. 3a-b and 3g, comparable numbers of glucagon+ cells were observed in wild-type and sel1lβgeo/βgeo embryos. sel1l is thus unlikely to be required for the generation of early endocrine cells during the first transition .

while the majority of sel1lβgeo/βgeo embryos  die before the initiation of the major wave of cell differentiation in the developing pancreas , about 5% of these embryos are viable at e <dig> . to determine if sel1l is required for differentiation of pancreatic epithelial cells during the secondary transition , we analyzed the expression of three pancreatic lineage markers: insulin , glucagon  and amylase  in these embryos. significant numbers of glucagon+ and insulin+ cells were detected in wild-type embryos at e <dig>  . in contrast, the numbers of glucagon+ and insulin+ cells were significantly reduced in sel1lβgeo/βgeo embryos . abundant amylase+ cells are present in wild-type embryos at e <dig>  . in contrast, no amylase+ cells are detectable in sel1lβgeo/βgeo embryos . disruption of sel1l function thus results in an impaired differentiation of both acinar and islet cells.

sel1l-deficient pancreatic epithelium exhibits inhibited growth and differentiation ex vivo
to ensure that the growth and differentiation defects observed in sel1lβgeo/βgeo embryos were not due to the effect of global embryonic growth retardation of these embryos, we studied the pancreatic phenotype of sel1lβgeo/βgeo embryos using an organ culture system. the dorsal pancreatic bud of wild-type and sel1lβgeo/βgeo embryos were isolated at e <dig>  and cultured for  <dig> days. the cultured pancreatic explants were then analyzed by immunofluorescence using antibodies against pdx <dig> and insulin. in general, sel1l-deficient pancreatic epithelium grows poorly  with about half of the cultured mutant epithelia failing to form branched epithelial structures. this is in sharp contrast to the growth behavior of wild-type pancreatic epithelia, which form a branched epithelial structure . the number of insulin+ cells was significantly decreased in sel1l-deficient pancreatic explants , as compared to that in wild-type control explants . amylase+ cells were detected in cultured sel1l-deficient explants , although the number of amylase+ cells was significantly lower compared to that in wild-type control explants . thus, the pancreatic epithelium of sel1lβgeo/βgeo embryos displays impaired growth, branching morphogenesis and lineage differentiation ex vivo. these findings confirm that the pancreatic defects observed in sel1l-deficient embryos at e <dig>  are not due to the global growth retardation.

pancreatic progenitor cells in sel1l-deficient embryos at e <dig>  are confined to a pluripotent progenitor state
to gain insight into the molecular basis underlying the pancreatic defects in sel1lβgeo/βgeo embryos, we first analyzed the expression of several transcription factors important for pancreatic epithelial growth and lineage formation. immunostaining was carried out to assess the expression of sox <dig>  pdx <dig> and ptf1a in e <dig>  sel1lβgeo/βgeo embryos. pdx <dig> expression was uniformly detected in the pancreatic epithelial cells of sel1lβgeo/βgeo embryos . this is in sharp contrast to wild-type embryos where pdx <dig> expression was differentially expressed in the pancreatic epithelial cells, with high expression in a subset of the core epithelial cells and low expression in the peripheral epithelial cells . no ptf1a expression was detected in the pancreatic epithelium of sel1lβgeo/βgeo embryos , whereas clear co-expression of ptf1a and pdx <dig> was detected in the proacini in the periphery of the pancreatic epithelial buds . sox <dig> was detected in approximately 20% of the pdx1+ cells in wild-type embryos . in contrast, sox <dig> expression was observed in more than 70% of the pdx1+ cells in sel1lβgeo/βgeo embryos . these findings are consistent with the notion that the pancreatic epithelial cells in sel1lβgeo/βgeo embryos at e <dig>  are restricted the pancreatic progenitor state.

pharmacological inhibition of notch signaling rescues endocrine lineage formation in sel1lβgeo/βgeo embryos
sel1l was thought to be a negative regulator for notch signaling  <cit> . indeed, the pancreatic phenotype in sel1lβgeo/βgeo embryos shows remarkable similarity to that of mouse or zebrafish embryos over-expressing notch intracellular domain, the constitutively active form of notch receptors  <cit> . we speculated that the impaired pancreatic epithelial growth and differentiation in sel1l-deficient embryos may be due to an increased notch signaling activity. to test this possibility, we used the γ-secretase inhibitor, dapt , to suppress notch signaling in pancreatic explants culture. the dorsal pancreatic bud of wild-type and sel1lβgeo/βgeo embryos was isolated at e <dig>  and cultured for  <dig> days in the absence or presence of dapt. at a concentration of  <dig> μm, dapt did not exhibit detectable effects on the growth, branching morphology and endocrine cell differentiation of wild-type pancreatic epithelium . at the same concentration, however, dapt caused a significant expansion of the sel1l-deficient pancreatic epithelium . importantly, dapt treatment resulted in a marked increase in the number of insulin+ cells . these observations indicate that pharmacological inhibition of notch signaling rescues, at least partially, the pancreatic epithelial growth and endocrine differentiation defects of sel1lβgeo/βgeo embryos.

discussion
the genetic determinants underlying vertebrate pancreatic development are not completely understood. in the present study, we report that sel1l expression in the developing mouse pancreas coincides with differentiation of the endocrine and exocrine lineages during the second transition. embryos homozygous for a gene trap insertion in sel1l display impaired pancreatic epithelial growth and differentiation. pharmacological inhibition of notch signaling partially rescues the pancreatic phenotype of sel1l-deficient embryos. together, these data provide evidence that sel1l is required for growth and differentiation of the mammalian pancreatic epithelial cells. the underlying mechanism may be that sel1l functions as a negative regulator for the notch signaling pathway by facilitating degradation of the notch intracellular domain.

donoviel et. al. previously reported that the mouse sel1l gene is highly transcribed in the acini of the developing pancreas at e <dig>  and e <dig>   <cit> . we show, by immunohistological analysis of the β-galactosidase reporter in sel1l, that sel1l is also highly expressed in early glucagon+ and insulin+ cells  generated during the first transition period of pancreatic development  <cit> . consistent with the sel1l mrna expression pattern reported by donoviel et. al., we reveal that at e <dig>  sel1l is broadly expressed in the pdx1+ pancreatic epithelia . interestingly, significantly lower sel1l expression is observed in the undifferentiated pancreatic epithelial cells  that express sox <dig>  <cit> . our findings therefore indicate that sel1l expression is enhanced in the committed pancreatic epithelial cells or differentiated endocrine and exocrine cells.

the selective expression of sel1l in differentiating or differentiated pancreatic epithelial cells is highly suggestive of a role for sel1l in promoting lineage differentiation during the secondary transition. to define the role of sel1l in pancreatic development, we characterized the pancreatic phenotype of embryos homozygous for a gene trap insertion in sel1l. we show that wild-type and sel1l-deficient embryos have a comparable pancreatic epithelial size at e <dig>  , suggesting that sel1l function is dispensable for the induction and early growth of pancreatic epithelial cells. at e <dig> , however, sel1l-deficient pancreatic epithelia are significantly smaller and display an impaired branching morphology . importantly, sel1l-deficient pancreatic epithelia at e <dig>  completely lack amylase+ cells  and have significantly reduced numbers of glucagon+ and insulin+ cells . also, by analyzing the phenotype of cultured sel1l-deficient dorsal pancreatic epithelia, we confirmed that the pancreatic defects in sel1l-deficient embryos are not due to the effect of global growth retardation of the sel1l-deficient embryos . together, these data strongly suggest that sel1l plays an important role in mouse pancreatic organogenesis by facilitating differentiation of the endocrine and exocrine lineages of the pancreas.

the c. elegans ortholog of the mammalian sel1l gene, sel- <dig>  was originally identified by genetic screening as a negative regulator for lin-12/notch signaling  <cit> . biochemical studies have shown that sel- <dig> regulates lin-12/notch receptor turnover  <cit> . whether or not sel1l has similar functions in the mammalian system remains unclear  <cit> . in this study, we provide two lines of evidence that suggest sel1l also functions as a negative regulator for notch signaling, at least in the developing mouse pancreas. first, the observed pancreatic phenotype in sel1l mutant embryos show remarkable similarity to the pancreatic phenotype of transgenic vertebrate embryos over-expressing the notch intracellular domain, the constitutively active form of notch  <cit> . second, we show that treatment of cultured sel1l-deficient pancreatic epithelium with dapt, a potent notch signaling inhibitor, partially rescues the growth and differentiation defects of sel1l-deficient pancreatic epithelium .

how does sel1l negatively control notch signaling in the developing mammalian pancreas is the focus of our current investigation. genetic and biochemical evidences from other organisms such as drsophila and c. elegans suggest that notch signaling is regulated at multiple levels and through multiple mechanisms, including stochastical gene expression  <cit> , selective ligand-receptor interactions  <cit> , intracellular trafficking  <cit> , and stability of nicd, the active form of notch receptors  <cit> . given the previous finding that mammalian nicd are ubiquitinated and degraded through both the proteasomal and lysosomal systems  <cit> , it is conceivable that sel1l may be directly or indirectly involved in control of nicd degradation. in this regard, it is noteworthy to mention that recent biochemical data from our laboratory indicate that nicd has significantly higher protein stability in sel1l-deficient mef cells . further proof of this hypothesis will require a detailed biochemical analysis of sel1l and notch interactions.

biochemical evidences from other laboratories have also underscored the importance of sel1l in maintaining er homeostasis. sel1l interacts with the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase hrd <dig> to facilitate the dislocation of unfolded or misfolded proteins from the er lumen into the cytosol for degradation  <cit> . consistent with this, we have recently shown that homozygous sel1l mutant mice develop systemic er stress. the impact of er stress on pancreatic epithelial proliferation and differentiation remains undefined from the current study. however, several hypothetical roles of er stress in pancreatic organ development and growth can be proposed. first, er stress affects global gene expression. upon er stress, translation is generally down to reduce production of er client proteins. concomitantly, transcription of genes encoding er chaperones and er-associated degradation  machinery is increased. second, er stress blocks or reduces protein secretion by mammalian cells. this will directly affect cell signaling and cell functions. finally, prolonged er stress activates the signaling pathways leading to apoptosis.

CONCLUSIONS
we report that during mouse pancreatic development, sel1l is preferentially expressed in the differentiating or differentiated pancreatic epithelial cells. disruption of sel1l function results in impaired endocrine lineage formation and delayed exocrine lineage differentiation. pharmacological suppression of notch signaling in cultured pancreatic explants partially rescues the endocrine cell differentiation defect. our data suggest that sel1l may regulate pancreatic epithelial growth and differentiation by suppressing notch-mediated signaling.
