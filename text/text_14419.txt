BACKGROUND
basic and experimental research during recent years has advanced our understanding of immune-regulatory mechanisms in health and disease. an example is the concept of th <dig> versus th <dig> responses applied in immuno-epidemiological studies  <cit>  aiming to identify causal pathways linking immunological mechanisms to health outcomes such as allergy. to investigate possible pathways in epidemiological studies, researchers regress clinical outcomes or surrogate endpoints to heterogeneous predictor variables collected from large populations. immuno-epidemiologists typically enumerate immunological mechanisms of interest by collecting various immune biomarkers presumed to result from different immune cells. for example, in allergy research, researchers obtain concentrations of different cytokines presumed to result from th <dig>  th <dig>  or t-reg cells from cell cultures under different immunological conditions. the cytokine measurements are assumed to characterise the major immunological pathways involved in the development of atopic diseases, i.e. the th1/th <dig> balance and immune regulation  .fig.  <dig> conceptual model: the figure visualizes current immunological concepts underlying atopic diseases and allergy. first, immuno-stimulating factors, e.g. infections or exposure to dust mite excretion or to helminths exert differential effects on th1-, th <dig> or treg responses. in concert these mechanisms are presumed to affect the th1/th <dig> balance considered to be a major determinant for regulation of specific ige that is a predictor for a positive skin pricktest . further downstream, the model assumes that t-reg modifies the effect of th1/th <dig> balance on the regulation of specific ige antibodies as well as the effect of specific ige on positivity of skin pricktest 



researchers often have to deal with several peculiarities of such immunological data  <cit> . these include non-normality of distributions due to substantial skewness or the existence of non-detectable values . for each of these problems, statistical approaches have been proposed: robust methods to deal with the non-normality  <cit> , imputation techniques to deal with “non-detects”  <cit> , use of kaplan-meier analysis for censored data  <cit> , advanced regression models for non-normal data   <cit> , and methods for the analysis of repeated immunological measures  <cit> . these methodological advances have substantially improved the use of a few immunological parameters, such as outcomes or predictor variables, in classical regression approaches.

however, recent progress in analytical methods has considerably increased the number of immune markers to be collected in immuno-epidemiological studies. markers are often highly correlated and immunologists have already embraced the appropriate “latent variable” approach by considering a battery of correlated immune markers, like cytokines, as indicators of underlying latent mechanisms . previously applied approaches incorporating the idea of latent variables have been predominantly data driven, such as principal component analysis  <cit>  or latent class analysis  <cit> . other authors have used simple summary measures of biologically unrelated immune responses, such as ratios of distinct immune responses   <cit> . what is missing is an analytical strategy that additionally incorporates the immunologists’ hypothesised underlying biological mechanisms and uses appropriate and easy-to-follow statistical procedures.

unfortunately, due to the inherent difficulty of applying these more sophisticated statistical approaches, researchers still use simple analytical approaches for multiple markers. common strategies are to analyse each marker separately  <cit>  or to include the battery of original markers simultaneously as predictors in multivariate regression models  <cit> . the flowchart shown in fig.  <dig> illustrates the traditional multivariate regression approach for immune markers, neglecting any a priori knowledge about the existing underlying biological mechanisms or pathways. from a statistician’s perspective, this approach is vulnerable to serious methodological flaws that potentially can invalidate the results. the most frequent are: i) type i error inflation from multiple testings, ii) estimation problems due to multicollinearity or neglect of measurement error, and most importantly, iii) type ii errors, i.e. missing true associations, because statistical analysis is based on immune markers that only reflect a small part of the variation of the underlying causal immunological mechanism.fig.  <dig> traditional approach vs. framework approach for statistical analysis of multiple immune markers. the left side illustrates the conventional statistical regression approach selecting potentially relevant markers primarily on the basis of statistical significance in a multivariate regression model. the right side illustrates the proposed approach incorporating a priori existing immunological knowledge  in combination with appropriate statistical methods . the aim is to iteratively aggregate information from single measurements  to summary indices reflecting the underlying immunological construct  either to further aggregate these summary indices to joint distribution constructs such as th1/th <dig> balance  and/or to explore the inter-relationship of these summary indices/joint distribution indicators in multiple regression analysis . see text for further details



in this paper, we present an extension of a previously described work  <cit> , an analytical framework approach aimed at analysing multiple immune markers clustered at two functional levels by integrating existing knowledge about the underlying immunological mechanisms . we illustrate the application of our approach to cytokine data from a large immuno-epidemiological study , which is aimed at investigating risk factors and immunological pathways for atopic diseases and asthma.

methods
this section consists of two parts. first, we describe the dataset used to illustrate the application of our analytical approach. secondly, we present the theoretical framework for the analytical strategy.

study population
the scaala salvador study enrolled  <dig> children from salvador in northeastern brazil, a large urban center with a population of  <dig>  million and a high prevalence of asthma symptoms such as wheezing  and atopy . the design of the study has been described in detail elsewhere  <cit> . of the  <dig> children originally included in the study, we obtained cytokine measurements for a subpopulation of  <dig> children. of those, we excluded  <dig> children with negligible mitogen response for all cytokines measured, likely due to laboratory errors. of the remaining  <dig> children, we analysed data from  <dig> children with valid values for all  <dig> measurements .

immunological measurements
venous blood was collected into heparinized tubes and cultured at a dilution of 1: <dig> in rpmi  supplemented with 10 mm glutamine  and 100 μg/ml gentamicin . we measured the production of four cytokines, ifn-γ, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  in supernatant fluids collected from whole blood cultures using commercially available antibody pairs and recombinant cytokine standards  by sandwich elisa, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cytokine concentrations were determined by interpolation of standard curves. the detection limits  for each cytokine were  <dig> /500 pg/ml,  <dig> /4000 pg/ml,  <dig> /300 pg/ml, and  <dig> /500 pg/ml for il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ifn-γ, and il- <dig>  respectively. for each cytokine we obtained five different measurements for the different culture conditions. whole blood cultures were started within 6 h of blood collection and were maintained in a humidified environment of 5 % co <dig> at 37 °c for 24 h for detection of il- <dig> and for 5 days for the detection of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and ifn-γ in the presence of pokeweed mitogen   media alone ), and the antigens ascaris lumbricoides , blomia tropicalis , and dermaphagoides pteronyssinus , details of the cell culture stimulation experiments are described elsewhere . cytokine measurements below detection limits were considered “non-responders” and assigned a cytokine concentration equal to the lower detection limit, while measurements above the detection limit were assigned a concentration equal to the upper detection limit. children with detectable levels of cytokines  were assigned to ordered categories with cut-offs based on median or tertiles for each cytokine and culture condition. il- <dig> and il- <dig> responses to mitogen, for which there was a higher proportion of responders, were classified into four categories . all other measures were classified into three categories . we measured four different specific iges  specific to dermaphagoides pteronyssinus, blomia tropicalis, periplaneta americana, and blatella germanica) in serum according to the manufacturer’s instructions .

software
all statistical analyses were conducted using the statistical software package stata .

analytical framework for statistical analysis of multiple immune biomarkers
figure  <dig> contrasts the traditional regression approach and the suggested framework approach. both analytical approaches start with an outcome variable of interest, e.g. a surrogate endpoint or intermediate biomarker such as specific ige and potential immunological predictor variables, such as cytokines. in the additional file  <dig> we contrast results of applying both the traditional approach and the framework approach to a typical immunological outcome ; these are further compared in the discussion section. in the following section we describe the suggested framework step by step.

step 1: grouping immune markers by using pre-existing knowledge
the objective of the first step is to maximize the use of existing immunological knowledge . to achieve this in immuno-epidemiological studies, researchers should group the immune markers according to a conceptual model that graphically represents the proposed relationships of each immune marker to an underlying immunological mechanism and the inter-relationship between these. often a multilevel causal framework is necessary with multiple markers for each level. in allergy research, immunologists typically classify cytokines according to distinct types of immune responses  response). further they obtain for each cytokine multiple measurements under different immunological conditions . in the multilevel context we consider level  <dig> as the multiple markers for a particular cytokine and level  <dig> as the different cytokine relating to a larger mechanism . as an example, the two-level conceptual framework for the cytokine data from the scaala study is shown in fig.  <dig>  we will discuss this framework in detail later in the results section.fig.  <dig> conceptual model incorporating three inter-related immunological mechanisms  quantified by a battery of hierarchically clustered immune markers . for each cytokine concentrations were determined from different cell cultures . the model incorporates a-priori knowledge about which cytokine relates to which specific mechanism, e.g. to use ifn-y as a marker for the th <dig> response or to use il- <dig> as a marker for the th <dig> response. further knowledge excludes the asc measure assumed to reflect a more complex difficult to interpret immune response. the numbered bullets  correspond to the analytical steps illustrated in fig. 2  the legend to the bullet briefly summarizes the analytical step



step 2: data exploration, data recoding
the objective of the second step is to examine the statistical properties of each measurement  and to employ both meaningful and statistically appropriate transformations and recoding . if this cannot be achieved, researchers may decide to omit the entire measurement; in scaala, for example, the tgf-ß measures could not be used due to assay malfunction. empirically, the best approach is to assume that none of the data will follow a perfect normal distribution but will instead suffer from various violations of distributional assumptions, such as extreme skewness, non-detections, missing data, ceiling effects, or bimodal distributions. for specific distributional forms, data transformations can be used to achieve approximate normal distributions  <cit> . if data are truncated, for example by the “detection limits” of the assay, approaches such as the kaplan-meier method  or the generalized wilcoxon test may be applied to use this data for epidemiological association testing  <cit> . if theoretically justified, a simpler and more straightforward approach is to recode the data into distinct response categories . cut points for defining response categories must be carefully chosen. however, unfortunately, in contrast to other areas of medical research such agreed cut-off values for immunological experiments often do not exist. in this case, cut points for categorisation should be based on characteristics of the distribution of the measurements, such as quantiles . we strongly suggest refraining from bias that introduces oversimplification, e.g. categorising normally distributed continuous data into dichotomous categories such as low and high responders.

step 3: intramarker  analysis
having arrived at statistically usable operationalisations of individual measurements in step  <dig>  the objective of this step is to study the associative patterns within a level  <dig> immunological variable  and to search for further meaningful and statistically justified aggregation to summary scores . for example, association analysis of different stimulation methods for the same cytokine in culture experiments may suggest deriving one or more stimulation aggregate scores. table  <dig> provides an overview of statistical methods for interdependence analysis and data aggregation of immunological markers, depending on the properties of the measurement identified in step  <dig>  a good overview of the specific choice of methods is presented in our previously published guide for immunologists  <cit> , while other authors provide details about factor analytic methods for continuous variables  <cit>  or correspondence techniques for binomial, nominal, or ordinal variables  <cit> . as this step is crucially important, researchers should always first visually explore bivariate associations using contingency tables, correspondence bi-plots, or scatter plots .table  <dig> statistical approaches for interdependence analysis of immunological markers dependent on the scale of measurement

rules of thumb for quantifying the strength of association based on the magnitude of association measures : no association: 0 < |γ| < =  <dig> , weak:  <dig>  < |γ| <  <dig> , moderate:  <dig>  < |γ| < =  <dig> , strong: |γ| >  <dig> 



the most important part of step  <dig> is deciding upon the potential aggregation of measurements to level  <dig> scores, e.g. whether measurements from various stimulation experiments with one cytokine read-out may be aggregated to an overall cytokine response score or not. we suggest the following criteria :strong but simple positive association patterns  between a set of immune markers indicate the presence of a major underlying immunological mechanism. in this case, measurements should be combined using simple aggregation functions, such as the average response  or the maximum response .

if multivariate correlation or correspondence analysis identifies weak to moderate associations or a more complex association pattern , investigators should seek to reduce the multidimensional data to an immunologically meaningful factor solution. the resulting summary scores are weighted averages of the original markers, with factor loadings representing the weights.

if no meaningful pattern is observed, investigators should interpret the measures as

“immunologically independent”, with each measure likely to represent different underlying immunological phenomena. as a general rule, the aggregation of such independent markers to simple summary scores  should be avoided because information is lost; the interpretation of aggregated independent markers is more complex.



step 4: intermarker analysis
if the data are conceptually structured in multiple levels, e.g. an immunological mechanism  being operationalised by responses of different cytokines, which in turn were obtained from measurements during multiple stimulation assays , the analytical strategy of step  <dig> should be repeated on the obtained aggregate scores from step  <dig>  the objective again is to explore association patterns  allowing to further aggregate the data to immunological functional indices  . for example, immunologists know that both il- <dig> and il- <dig> are produced by th <dig> cells and thus show a strong association pattern due to this common mechanism . in this case aggregating the antigen-specific summary scores for il- <dig> and il- <dig>  to a th <dig> summary score may be justified.

step 5: interdependence or dependence analysis among the immunological summary indices
this step aims to explore the inter-relationship among the aggregated summary scores , either to elucidate possible interdependence or to perform dependence analysis. if there is no clear a priori hypothesis with respect to the direction of the relationship, the analytical approaches from steps  <dig> and  <dig> are repeated. in contrast, if investigators a priori assume an underlying mechanism, the assumptions about the direction of this mechanism should be incorporated in the model. for example, if researchers assume that t-reg responses affect the th <dig> response , a regression model using the th <dig> score as the dependent variable and t-reg score as the independent  variable may be warranted . further details describing the differences between dependence and interdependence analysis are described elsewhere  <cit> .

step 6: dependence analysis based on the immunological summary scores
the final step aims to relate the immunological summary scores derived in steps  <dig> to  <dig> to outcomes typically observed in immunological studies  .

RESULTS
to illustrate the application of the analytical framework we used data from  <dig> children with valid measurements of  <dig> immune markers, namely concentrations of four different cytokines  obtained under five different stimulation experiments.

step 1: grouping of variables using pre-existing knowledge
figure  <dig> is a graphical representation of the pre-conceived relationships at the design of the study. the bullets refer to the steps of the analytical approach; step  <dig> is not shown. conceptually, we consider the measurements to be hierarchically clustered in a two-level structure. at level  <dig> we consider for each cytokine the measurements obtained from the five stimulation experiments, and at level  <dig> we consider three inter-related latent immunological constructs: 1) an immune regulatory network, which is viewed as being interrelated with 2) th <dig> responses and 3) th <dig> immune responses. the regulatory response is quantified by concentrations of il- <dig> and tgf-ß, the th <dig> response by concentrations of ifn-γ and il- <dig>  and the th <dig> response by concentrations of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  in the present study, data from tgf-ß measurements were unusable due to assay malfunction and il- <dig> measurements were not available due to funding constraints. we categorised the level  <dig> measurements into four groups. the first group includes the mite-specific responses b. tropicalis  and d. pteronyssinus , which we assume a priori as highly immunologically related. in the second group, we place the responses to a. lumbricoides , which we expect to reflect a distinct and more complex helminth-induced immune response. in the third group, we consider the mitogen responses  presumed to reflect the maximum possible response, and in the fourth group the spontaneous non-stimulated cytokine responses. further details on our a priori hypotheses about the presumed immunological mechanisms underlying the different cytokine measurements are presented in the legend to fig.  <dig> 

step 2: data exploration, data recoding
box plots visualising the distribution of the original data are shown in the . we observed non-detects for all  <dig> cytokine measurements in considerable proportions of the participants . moreover, exploratory data analysis considering the cytokine concentration of responding individuals, including histograms and distributional plots , suggested severe deviations from normality. both observations indicated the necessity for a unifying ordinal categorisation of the data with the objective of retaining maximum possible information. we thus decided to pursue a three-category approach, except for mitogen responses of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  where four categories were warranted. in the absence of an agreed immunological cut-off, we classified non-detects as non-responders, below-median measurements of detectable quantities as low responders, and above-median measurements as high responders. for mitogen responses of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  detectable measurements were grouped using tertiles as cut-offs . additional file 1: table s <dig> provides the distributions of the recoded categorical data. as expected, cytokine response rates were higher in mitogen-stimulated cultures  compared to antigen-specific cultures  and unstimulated cultures .

step 3: intramarker  analysis
this step aimed to detect new or confirm a priori hypothesized associations at level  <dig> . table  <dig> shows a summary of this analytical step, displaying for each cytokine and all pairs of bivariate comparisons the association measure  and the p-value. to further illustrate the analyses conducted in this analytical step, we show detailed results for one cytokine  in the . the interdependence pattern identified among the five multiple measurements show that these measures quantify distinct immunological phenomena: the specific responses to different antigens, the non-specific response , and the unstimulated spontaneous immune response . in more detail, we observed a very strong positive association between the mite-specific responses  for ifn-γ, il- <dig>  and il- <dig> ; for il- <dig> the correlation was substantially lower . in contrast, the mite-specific responses  showed substantially weaker associations with helminth-specific responses , with the exception of il- <dig>  where all three antigen measures were highly related. this finding corroborates our a priori hypothesis to consider asc as a separate immunological measure in any further analyses. however, we decided to aggregate the derm and blom measures for each cytokine to a summary scale quantifying the overall mite-induced response  by considering the highest achieved response for either antigen. the distribution of this measure is shown in table  <dig>  further, we found that for all cytokines the spontaneous  and mitogen responses  showed absence of association  with the antigen-specific measures and should thus be considered as separate scales in any further analyses.table  <dig> summary of bivariate association analyses between each culture condition for each cytokine using data collected from  <dig> children in scaala salvador

step 4: intermarker analysis
in this step, we conducted an intercytokine analysis examining the association patterns between any pair of cytokines on three different scales  . as expected, we observed for the two th2-related cytokines il- <dig> and il- <dig> positive associations on both antigen and mitogen scales , but no association on the spontaneous scale . these results were corroborated by correspondence analysis . given this moderate positive association, we calculated a th <dig> summary score by considering the highest observed response category of either th2-related cytokine . we calculated the th <dig> score for both the antigen and mitogen scale.table  <dig> summary of result of intercytokine analysis using data collected from  <dig> children in scaala salvador

considering the antigen scale, the th <dig> response  showed independence of the th <dig> response  but positive association with the regulatory response . further, we found that all four cytokines showed positive association patterns on the mitogen scale but no association on the spontaneous response. as explained above, the present study yielded only one cytokine each for the regulatory response and the th <dig> response, allowing the intermarker aggregation step for th <dig> and t-reg constructs to be skipped.

for any further analysis steps, we considered two scales  for th <dig> and th <dig> responses and three scales  for t-reg responses. in addition, since one of the main hypotheses about the immunological mechanisms underlying atopic diseases and asthma relates to the balance of th <dig> and th <dig> cytokines, we cross-tabulated the th <dig> and th <dig> aggregated scores considering the joint th1-th <dig> response. we grouped the data into a th1/th <dig> balance score with higher values referring to th <dig> skewness: 0:th <dig> negative and th <dig> negative, 1:th <dig> positive and th <dig> negative, 2: th <dig> positive and th <dig> positive, and 3: th <dig> negative and th <dig> positive. the balance indicator was calculated for both antigen and mitogen scale. table  <dig> shows the distributions of the final immunological summary scores that will be considered in the next analysis steps.table  <dig> distributions of final immunological summary scales derived from cytokine data collected from  <dig> children in scaala salvador

step 5: interdependence or dependence analysis among the immunological summary scores
in this step, we conducted an exploratory interdependence analysis among the summary scores th <dig>  th <dig>  th1/th <dig> balance, and t-reg. a summary of the results is presented in table 6; plots of correspondence analysis are displayed in the . three important findings have emerged: i) th1/th <dig> balance on the antigen scale presented as independent of t-reg, both for spontaneous and mitogen scales , ii) a weak association between th <dig> response and t-reg ; iii) for antigen responses no association between th <dig> and th <dig> , no association between th <dig> and t-reg , and small association between th1-th <dig> balance and t-reg ; iv) considering the mitogen responses all four summary scores showed positive associations. the important consequence of these results for step  <dig> dependency analysis is to consider t-reg and th1/th <dig> balance as independent immunological variables. we consider the antigen scale as the primary measure to quantify th1/th <dig> balance and the spontaneous scale of t-reg to quantify the immune regulatory mechanism.table  <dig> results of interdependence analysis among the immunological summary scores

step 6: dependence analysis based on the immunological summary scores
finally, we illustrate how the immunological summary scores derived in steps  <dig> to  <dig> can be used to describe the association with an important immunological outcome . we compare the results of our framework approach with a classical stepwise regression approach using the log-transformed raw cytokine . detailed results of both approaches are shown in the . in summary, the traditional stepwise regression approach revealed five significant parameters. we found a significant strong positive effect of il- <dig> , a 10-fold smaller positive effect for il- <dig> , a 60-fold smaller positive effect of il- <dig>  and il- <dig> concentrations , and a 20-fold smaller negative association with ifn-γ . all other parameters failed to retain significance.

by contrast, the framework approach results in the aggregated immunological summary scores that were included in a multivariate regression model as predictors for sige, namely the dummy-coded th1/th <dig> balance score  and the dummy-coded t-reg score . since we do not assume any effect of th <dig> on sige, we recoded the th1/th <dig> balance score by pooling the first two categories . moreover, since we expect a downregulating effect of strong il- <dig> responses we dichotomize the t-reg score . the detailed results are shown in the . briefly, compared to the reference category  the model showed a strong significant increase of sige in the case of a skewed th2+ response  and a non-significant, substantially smaller increase induced by a balanced th <dig> response . additionally, the model reveals a negative but non-significant effect of a high spontaneous il- <dig> response . we also investigated the inclusion of interaction terms between th1/th <dig> balance and t-reg that did not show any significant effects. we will not discuss this dependence analysis any further here; the detailed effects of cytokine pattern on sige and other endpoints observed in scaala, such as the skin prick test or clinical outcomes like allergy or asthma symptoms, will be examined in future work.

traditional regression approach
in contrast, the application of the traditional stepwise regression to the original cytokine measures as described in fig.  <dig>  yielded results that were not straightforward to interpret. while finding a strong positive effect of il- <dig> and a negative effect of ifn-γ  was consistent with the hygiene hypothesis, the interpretation of other parameters in the final model was difficult. for example, the much lower effect of il- <dig>  compared to il- <dig>  or the statistically significant association with high il- <dig>  might have arisen from multicollinearity or other peculiarities, such as deviation from the multivariate normal distribution of this data .

discussion
in the present work, we present an approach for the statistical analysis of multiple, often related immunological markers that capitalizes on a priori existing knowledge and insight into immunological mechanisms. we illustrated the proposed approach using a dataset from a large immuno-epidemiological study  conducted to investigate the potential immunological mechanisms underlying atopic diseases and asthma. the immune markers collected in this study included multiple measurements of different cytokines obtained under different whole blood culture conditions.

the application of our approach to the cytokine data collected in scaala salvador suggested th1/th <dig> skewness as the most relevant predictor for elevated sige levels, rather than the th <dig> response itself. further, the approach suggested a potential independent down-regulating effect of strong t-regulatory spontaneous responses. in contrast, the traditional stepwise regression approach using the full dataset and all original cytokine measures yielded results that were difficult to interpret .

what is the research implication of this approach and why it might prove superior to the traditional statistical approach? the suggested approach is still based on common statistical concepts such as the idea of latent variables. however, the stepwise implementation is less data driven because each analytical step is guided by a conceptual model that specifies the presumed underlying immunological mechanism. conceptually, the approach resembles the work employed by empirical scientists from other areas, e.g. the social sciences, aimed to investigate complex phenomena involving concepts that are not directly observable . approaches like structural equation modelling are frequently used to implement the underlying concepts by using measurement models based on multi-layered indicator variables.

in the proposed approach, we invite immuno-epidemiologists to follow this well-developed approach of investigation including the idea of latent variables. our step  <dig> postulates to order or cluster measurements according to a preconceived conceptual model. this should reflect the best available knowledge at the time of conducting the analysis. for example, in the present study, researchers sought to characterize the t-regulatory response by obtaining concentrations of il- <dig> and tgf-ß in stimulated and non-stimulated cell cultures. our step  <dig> deals with the problem that rarely immunological data follow a normal distribution. researchers need to make decisions how to control the statistical peculiarities and to reduce the data, if necessary, e.g. to binary or ordered variables that are amenable to downstream statistical procedures. in the present example, the non-normal distribution of the data  required to employ different categorization levels. step  <dig> is an analogy to forming scales from individual questionnaire items. in theory, such aggregated scores may yield less measurement error and provide information more related to the underlying construct. in the present study, the il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ifn- γ and il- <dig> aggregated antigen scores reflect this step. step  <dig> allows further aggregation, just like different scales may aggregate to a well-being index in psychosocial research. in the present example, the il- <dig> and il- <dig> scores are further aggregated to an overall aggregated th <dig> score. like in the mentioned psychosocial example both step  <dig> and step  <dig> require active and thoughtful participation of the researcher to consider the possible content validity of score or index formation in the context of concurrent immunological knowledge. once the researcher has arrived at aggregated non redundant measures that reflect the underlying construct simple statistical procedures can be employed to quantify the relationship between the constructs . in the present example this step  <dig> involved constructing a th1/th <dig> balance score just by considering the joint distribution of th <dig> and th <dig> responses. in the final step, we proposed simple regression models aimed to relate the immunological summary constructs to outcomes of interest are the objective of the final step  <dig> . results from these models are easier to interpret than models using the original markers because they better quantify the impact of the potentially causing mechanisms on the outcomes of interest.

the strengths of this approach simultaneously bears the possible limitations. the strength at each step is to include the best available immunological knowledge in decision making about statistical procedures. for example, in step  <dig> decisions must be made to deal with missing data, with non-normally distributed data, whether the aggregated score has binominal  or ordinal characteristics . the limitation of the approach is that each step may introduce potential bias . however, if in future reports using this approach every step is carefully documented, together with providing the raw data in appendices or journal repositories, other researchers may choose to repeat the analysis using different aggregation modalities or to introduce new conceptual models as scientific insight progresses. such informed, transparent and conscious analytical process may contribute to a better understanding of complex immunological mechanisms.

CONCLUSIONS
we suggest a systematic analytical approach for complex immuno-epidemiological data that capitalizes on a framework incorporating pre-existing knowledge about the underlying immunological phenomena. our approach mimics the method of latent variable approaches such as principal components analysis, latent class analysis or structural equation modelling. however, with less harsh data assumption our analytical strategy circumvents peculiarities often encountered in real data such as violation of distributional assumptions or multicollinearity. the proposed approach may assist applied researchers in the area of immuno-epidemiology to quantify the immunological mechanisms underlying immunologically mediated diseases, such as allergic disease or asthma. using immunological summary scores that reflect distinct immunological concepts instead of the correlated original markers should substantially simplify data analysis in studies on relationships among non-immunological factors, immune responses, and disease.
