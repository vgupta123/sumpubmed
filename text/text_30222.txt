BACKGROUND
pex5p, the major import receptor for peroxisomal matrix proteins, is known to carry folded proteins across the peroxisomal membrane by a signal assembled shuttling mechanism  <cit> . it has been found to recognise the type  <dig> peroxisomal targeting signal  - a c-terminal tripeptide of consensus sequence ----co2-, carried by some  <dig> human proteins destined for the peroxisomal lumen. the pts <dig> sequence binds to pex5p in an extended conformation, which is accommodated in a deep cavity in the tetratricopeptide repeat  domain of pex5p  <cit>  . an additional interface, remote from the pts <dig> binding site, of about  <dig> Å <dig> has been found to form between pex5p and the model cargo protein sterol carrier protein  <dig> , as demonstrated by the crystal structure and solution studies of scp <dig> in complex with the c-terminal region of pex5p  <cit> . in the following we will refer to the interface as "ancillary" or "secondary". this interface utilises the first and fourth α-helices of scp <dig> and helices  <dig> and  <dig> from the pex5p c-terminal helical bundle  and its formation confers an increased binding affinity of around 6-fold when compared to a minimal pts <dig> hexapeptide , derived from the c-terminus of scp <dig>  <cit> . taken together, these observations may imply the presence of an additional receptor recognition element in scp <dig>  supplemental to the pts <dig> 

inspection of the secondary interface of the pex5p-scp <dig> complex structure reveals several intermolecular hydrogen bonds , in particular: the carboxylate group of glu <dig> from scp <dig> interacts with the side chains of two pex5p residues, arg <dig> and tyr620; lys <dig> from scp <dig> forms a salt bridge with asp <dig> from pex5p; finally, lys <dig> from scp <dig> interacts with the main chain carbonyl group of gly <dig> from pex5p. comparison with the pex5p apo-structure  <cit>  reveals that in the absence of scp <dig>  two residues from this interface, arg <dig> and asp <dig>  re-orient their sidechains to form an intramolecular salt bridge, inducing a re-orientation of the sidechain of tyr <dig> . an alignment of a set of pex5p sequences  indicates that while tyr <dig> and asp <dig> are only partly conserved, a basic residue at the position equivalent to arg <dig> in human pex5p is invariant.

in this study, we have made point mutations of two key residues of the ancillary scp <dig> binding interface in pex5p, arg <dig> and asp <dig>  to tryptophans to assess the relative importance of the additional interface in the recognition of scp <dig> by pex5p. to dissect the contributions of the pts <dig> and these additional interactions, we also used a version of scp <dig> lacking the c-terminal pts <dig>  for comparison. by four different approaches we demonstrate that while receptor-cargo binding and scp <dig> transfer into the peroxisome are absolutely dependent on the presence of the pts <dig>  the ancillary interface is found to be dispensable - mutations effecting binding do not inhibit peroxisomal import in vivo. these results indicate that the ancillary interface is unlikely to play an important role in the import of the pts <dig> protein scp <dig> 

RESULTS
yeast two-hybrid analysis of human pex5p interactions with scp2
first, we created mutant versions of the cargo-binding domain of pex5p , consisting of residues 315-639) and tested their capacity to interact with different versions of scp <dig> in the yeast two-hybrid system . as a control, we showed that the presence of the pts <dig> of scp <dig> is a pre-requisite for binding to pex5p, as no interaction could be detected in its absence, thus confirming previous findings  <cit> . the introduction of the mutation r608w into pex5p did result in a three-fold reduction of the interaction with both pre- and mscp <dig>  in contrast, the pex5p d624w mutation showed little affect, either leading to a slight decrease  or increase  of the interaction. to confirm that the observed decrease with the pex5p r608w construct was not due to problems with expression or stability of the protein, we performed western blotting analysis with pex5p antibodies on yeast lysates from cells expressing the different pex5p variants. we could see that all pex5p constructs were expressed at similar levels .

in vitro pex5p-scp <dig> binding
we tested the capacity of these mutants to bind mscp <dig> in vitro using isothermal titration microcalorimetry  . we observed that the pex5p r608w mutation resulted in a two fold reduction in scp <dig> binding, in agreement with our yeast-two-hybrid data. in addition, we found the binding stoichiometry reduced to  <dig> , indicating that only about two-thirds of the receptor was competent for scp <dig> cargo binding, compared to a value approaching one for wild-type. the binding stoichiometry was further lowered to  <dig>  when using the second pex5p mutant, d624w, coupled with an apparent tighter binding when compared to wild-type pex5p. additionally, we measured the binding affinity of the pex5p mutants against a peptide derived from the c-terminus of scp <dig> , a binding event that is independent of the ancillary interface. the pex5p r608w mutant bound to the peptide with a similar affinity as the wild-type protein. furthermore, the binding stoichiometry of this mutant was closer to that of wild-type pex5p, suggesting that the r608w mutant is impaired in binding when utilising the secondary interface but not when using the pts <dig> binding site alone.

a numbers in brackets indicate the number of measurements.

to determine whether structural alterations induced by the mutations were the cause of the observed binding defects, we subjected the mutants to circular dichroism spectropolarimetry  and static light scattering  analysis. while both mutants showed similar properties when tested with sls  , a difference could be seen with the d624w mutant using cd . wild-type pex5p is estimated to have  <dig>  ±  <dig> % α-helical content and r608w  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, in good agreement with the  <dig>  -  <dig> % of residues in α-helices  found within the various chains of apo-human pex5p in pdb entries 2c0m <cit>  and 2j9q <cit> . however, d624w carries only  <dig>  ±  <dig> % α-helix , suggesting that the d624w mutation may alter the folding properties of pex5p. these data show that a specific cargo recognition defect can be seen with the pex5p r608w mutant when binding full-length scp <dig> and that structural impairment was not the cause of this binding defect.

to further clarify the impaired binding between pex5p mutants and scp <dig>  we examined the interaction kinetics using the octet red <dig> assay system   <cit> . once again, in the absence of the pts <dig>  no binding could be measured - regardless of whether the presequence in scp <dig> or mutations in pex5p were present. we detected that relative to wild-type pex5p, each mutant displayed a  <dig>  -  <dig>  fold decreases in association rates . most strongly impaired in kon  was the infantile refsum disease mutant pex5ps600w  <cit> , a mutation in the 7c-loop  we have previously found not to bind to mscp <dig> in itc experiments and to impair import of scp <dig> and catalase in vivo  <cit> . in contrast, all mutants displayed very similar dissociation rates  to wild-type pex5p, with the exception of d624w, which had a  <dig>  fold more rapid koff from mscp <dig> compared to wild-type. thus, in line with our previous data, the ancillary interface residues arg <dig> and asp <dig> do have roles in receptor recognition and binding but at least in the case of arg <dig>  play a lesser role in the overall stability of the pex5p/scp <dig> complex. the impaired kon and koff demonstrated for d624w presumably result from the structural deviation shown above.

peroxisomal import of scp <dig> in fibroblast complementation assays
we have complemented pex5p impaired fibroblast cultures from zellweger syndrome patient pbd <dig>  <cit>  with the long isoform of human pex5p ) and pex5p mutated at residues arg <dig> and asp <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours after transfection, the ability of these complemented cells to import the reporter molecule gfp-mscp <dig> into peroxisomes was assayed by immunofluorescence microscopy . we also determined the localisation of pex5p using immunofluorescence. the cytosolic distribution of pex5p was not altered by the mutations and all ancillary interface mutants gave rise to a similar punctuate pattern for gfp-mscp <dig>  characteristic of peroxisomal localisation . even when the transfected cells were incubated at 40°c instead of 37°c  the pex5p mutants retained their ability to import gfp-scp <dig> into peroxisomes . in contrast, both negative controls, using pex5p s600w and wild-type pex5p with gfp-mscp2Δakl, showed diffuse gfp fluorescence , indicating that in each case gfp-scp <dig> is retained in the cytosol. thus, despite the moderate impairment of in vitro binding caused by mutation at the ancillary interface, the same mutations do not impair pex5p mediated peroxisomal import, at least of scp <dig> as an import substrate - although subtle alterations in import kinetics cannot entirely be excluded by our localisation assay. however, the presence of the pts <dig> and retention of the capacity of pex5p to act as a pts <dig> binding receptor are essential.

discussion
our data confirm previous findings  <cit>  that the pts <dig> of scp <dig> is essential for the interaction with the pts <dig> receptor pex5p and for its pex5p-mediated targeting to the peroxisomal matrix and we additionally characterise the role of the secondary binding site in cargo binding. while mutation of arg <dig> in pex5p impairs the binding affinity, stoichiometry  and association rate  with scp <dig>  its' introduction in vivo does not impair the capacity of pex5p to import scp <dig> into peroxisomes, suggesting that the ancillary interface, formed between scp <dig> and pex5p plays only a limited role in the import of scp <dig> 

the r608w and d624w mutations in pex5p, while not causing an obvious phenotype in vivo, do cause some interesting and unexpected behaviour in vitro. firstly, the apparent increase in binding affinity caused by the d624w mutation, an effect that seems to contradict the reduction observed with the r608w mutant. our cd data indicate that the d624w mutant has altered folding properties, in relation to the wild type and r608w mutant, which may affect the binding to scp <dig> in an unexpected way. a reduction in binding affinity can readily be justified, in terms of a loss of contact sites in pex5p. however, the reductions in binding stoichiometries of the mutants are less easily explained. we cannot absolutely rule out the possibility that the pex5p mutants are able to oligomerise, resulting in a change in the stoichiometry of the interaction. however, our sls data indicate that both mutants, like the wild type protein, are monomeric in solution, which makes this explanation unlikely. from the octet red <dig> experiments, we see that both mutants exhibit a slower association rate. this, together with the faster dissociation rate observed with the d624w mutant, combined with apparent changes in its' folding properties, could contribute to differences in the stoichiometries.

we are then left with the question as to what the possible function of the secondary interface in pts <dig> protein import may be. the capacity for pex5p to import folded proteins is well known and is likely to represent an essential part of its task since to date no chaperones have been identified within the peroxisomal matrix that could aid in the folding of imported substrates. therefore, two possible roles for the ancillary interface could be envisaged; increasing the overall stability of the receptor-cargo complex by providing extra contact sites between pex5p and the pts <dig> protein and/or a "quality control" step, allowing pex5p to check pts <dig> proteins for correct folding before importing them into the matrix, since the region in scp <dig> recognised by the ancillary interface, unlike the pts <dig>  is fully folded. however, it may be expected that impairment of either process would result in an inhibition of the import process, which is not the case in our hands. our data do not rule out the possibility that pex5p uses this secondary interface with other cargo proteins and indeed, the apparent conservation of the arg <dig> residue suggests a potential role in the function of pex5p. in addition, recent results indicate that other pts1-containing proteins interact with this same region of pex5p in a similar way . therefore, factors additional to the ancillary interface may determine the contribution of this binding site to cargo recognition. recent data indicate that human pts <dig> sequences show a range of binding affinities to pex5p  <cit> . it is not hard to imagine that proteins with a relatively low binding affinity may require additional contact sites, to improve their targeting, while those with a high binding affinity  would not. the targeting of gfp-skl to peroxisomes falls into the last category. gfp  is not expected to interact with the secondary interface in pex5p, yet it is still efficiently targeted, indicating that skl is sufficient to allow targeting in the absence of a secondary interface. consequently, further data on other pts <dig> cargo proteins are required, to provide insights into the role of the ancillary interface in peroxisome translocation.

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented in this study clarify that the mechanism of scp <dig> sorting to the peroxisome is absolutely pts <dig> dependent but independent of the ancillary interface. it remains to be seen if a broad set of proteins destined for the peroxisome lumen utilise this ancillary binding site, or if the majority rely on a more rugged "pts <dig> or nothing" selection, as appears to be the case here.
