BACKGROUND
bacteria have the ability to live as free-swimming planktonic cells or in the form of multicellular communities known as biofilms, the life style that confers tolerance towards challenging environmental conditions  <cit> . the ubiquitous second messenger bis- -cyclic dimeric gmp , plays a major role in the transition from the motile to the sessile life style on the single cell level . c-di-gmp is synthesized by diguanylate cyclases , ggdef domain proteins , and degraded by c-di-gmp phosphodiesterases , eal or hd-gyp domain proteins . these cyclic di-gmp metabolizing proteins occur almost ubiquitously in bacterial genomes with single bacterial genomes to possess from a single ggdef/eal domain protein to more than hundred . elucidating the precise role of individual ggdef/eal domain proteins will contribute to the understanding of the complex regulation of bacterial physiology by the c-di-gmp signalling system.

a variety of phenotypes such as motility, cell cycle and differentiation and virulence are regulated by c-di-gmp signalling, however, biofilm formation is studied most extensively . in the model organism salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium umr <dig>  c-di-gmp promotes a rdar  biofilm formation by stimulating the production of the extracellular matrix components, the exopolysaccharide cellulose and proteinaceous curli fimbriae  <cit> .

expression of the rdar morphotype is regulated by the luxr family transcriptional activator csgd, a major hub in rdar biofilm formation in s. typhimurium  <cit> . csgd is central in regulating the transition between biofilm formation and virulence. csgd expression is usually regulated by environmental stimuli such as temperature and growth phase from the transcriptional to the posttranscriptional level  <cit> . global transcriptional regulators such as rpos, ompr, h-ns and ihf regulate the transcription of csgd in s. typhimurium  <cit> . csgd expression is also adjusted post-transcriptionally by several small srnas and the rna chaperone hfq  and is a major target of c-di-gmp signalling  <cit> .

the genome of s. typhimurium contains twenty-two ggdef/eal domain proteins, not all are bona fide c-di-gmp metabolizing proteins  <cit> . task distribution is shown as distinct panels of proteins are associated with specific phenotypes such as csgd expression, cellulose biosynthesis, motility, invasion of epithelial cells, stimulation of a pro-inflammatory immune response and colonization of the gastrointestinal tract of mice  <cit> .

in rdar biofilm formation, two ggdef-eal proteins, stm <dig> and stm <dig> promote, while the four eal domain proteins stm <dig>  stm <dig>  stm <dig> and stm <dig> suppress csgd expression  <cit> . the transcriptional regulator csgd activates the expression of csgba, encoding the minor and major subunit of curli and adra, encoding the diguanylate cyclase adra. c-di-gmp produced by adra stimulates the cellulose synthase in order to activate cellulose biosynthesis  <cit> .

to further dissect the network of ggdef and eal domain proteins, we identified two novel ggdef domain proteins to regulate csgd expression. deletion of major phosphodiesterases indicates that elevated c-di-gmp levels regulate csgd expression and rdar morphotype by multiple pathways. identification of corresponding diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases points to local and global regulation of csgd expression by c-di-gmp signalling.

site directed mutagenesis to replace the glutamate in the eal motif of stm <dig> by alanine was carried out by scar less site directed mutagenesis  <cit> . in brief, a chloramphenicol resistance cassette fused to an i-scei recognition site by homologous recombination replaced the codon for glutamic acid  <dig> of stm <dig>  subsequently, plasmid pwrg <dig>  which encodes i-scei endonuclease under a tetracycline inducible promoter, aided replacement of the chloramphenicol cassette by a dna fragment of  <dig> bp  after selection on lb agar plates with iptg, arabinose and tetracycline  <cit> . stm <dig> harboring the desired mutation was verified by dna sequencing. primers used in this study are listed in additional file 1: table s2﻿.

protein techniques
for western blot analysis of csgd and c-di-gmp turnover protein expression, cells were grown on lb agar plates without salt for  <dig> h at 28°c.  <dig> mg  cells were harvested, resuspended in  <dig> μl sds sample buffer, and incubated at 95°c for  <dig> min. membrane proteins were resuspended in sample buffer with 8m urea. the protein content was analysed by coomassie blue staining  after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . equal amounts of protein were separated and subsequently transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane . detection of csgd was carried out using a polyclonal anti-csgd peptide antibody  and detection of 6xhis-tagged proteins with monoclonal anti 6xhis antibody as the primary antibodies and goat anti-rabbit/mouse immunoglobulin g conjugated with horseradish peroxidase  as the secondary antibodies, respectively  <cit> . chemiluminescence  was recorded using the las- <dig> system   <cit> . strain s. typhimurium mae <dig> was used as a positive control, whereas strain mae <dig>  a csgd deletion mutant, was used as negative control. western blotted membranes were subjected to the ponceau s staining to confirm equal loading of protein samples where appropriate.

beta galactosidase assay
promoter activity of csgd was assayed with different csgd promoter constructs  <cit> . expression of adra was analyzed with a chromosomal mudj transcriptional fusion in adra  <cit> . strains were grown on lb without salt plates supplemented with appropriate antibiotics and inducer. samples were collected after growth for  <dig> h at 28°c. β-galactosidase activity was the read out for promoter activity  <cit>  after adjustment of bacterial suspension to od600 =  <dig>  for puge <dig> and to  <dig>  for puge <dig>  puge <dig> and puge <dig>  normalized β-galactosidase activity was calculated using the formula: miller units = 1000 {/} with t = reaction time in min; v = volume of cell suspension. all β-galactosidase measurements were done in duplicates using at least three technical replicates. statistical analysis was performed applying an unpaired t-test with two-tailed p-value  using prism  <dig> .

RESULTS
identification of novel ggdef domain proteins promoting csgd expression
multicellular behavior as expressed by the rdar biofilm morphotype in s. typhimurium umr <dig> correlates with expression of the response regulator csgd, a major target of c-di-gmp signalling. as csgd expression is not completely abolished in a stm <dig> and stm <dig> double mutant  <cit> , re-assessment of the effect of the remaining ggdef proteins identified stm <dig> and stm <dig> to additionally activate csgd mediated rdar morphotype expression. the respective single deletion mutants exhibited a down regulation of the rdar morphotype  and csgd levels  and the double mutant had an additive effect .fig.  <dig> identification of novel ggdef domain proteins regulating csgd expression. a rdar morphotype formation of s. typhimurium umr <dig> and stm <dig> and stm <dig> mutants after  <dig> h of growth on congo red agar plates. b csgd levels after  <dig> h of growth at 28°c on lb without salt agar plates. wt is wild type s. typhimurium umr <dig>  mae <dig> is a csgd deletion mutant of umr <dig>  whereas mae <dig> strain is used as a csgd positive control




additive effect of ggdef domain proteins on csgd expression
a quadruple mutant with deletion of stm <dig>  stm <dig>  stm <dig> and stm <dig>  exhibited a smooth and white  morphotype on cr agar plates  with csgd expression additionally down regulated . over expression of the ggdef protein stm <dig> from pbad <dig> restored rdar morphotype and csgd expression in the Δ4dgc mutant of s. typhimurium umr <dig>  although stm <dig> is an established diguanylate cyclase  <cit> , reportedly its catalytic activity is not required to restore most of the phenotypes associated with the deletion of  <dig> ggdef domain proteins in s. enteritidis including csgd expression  <cit> . however, a catalytic mutant of stm <dig> with the ggdef motif altered to ggaef did not affect the smooth and white colony morphotype and csgd expression, suggesting that the lack of c-di-gmp in Δ4dgc is the only factor mediating the down regulation of rdar morphotype and csgd expression.fig.  <dig> cumulative effect of ggdef proteins on rdar morphotype and csgd expression in s. typhimurium umr <dig>  a rdar morphotype and csgd levels of double and quadruple mutants of ggdef proteins after  <dig> h of growth at 28°c on lb without salt agar plates. b overexpression of the diguanylate cyclase stm <dig> in the Δ4dgc mutant restored rdar morphotype and csgd expression, in contrast to catalytically inactive stm4551e267a. cells were grown for  <dig> h at 28°c on lb without salt agar plates supplemented with ampicillin  and  <dig> % l-arabinose. vc = vector control pbad <dig>  p4551 = stm <dig> cloned in pbad <dig>  p4551e267a = catalytic mutant stm4551e267a cloned in pbad30




c-di-gmp turnover regulated by ggdef/eal domain proteins modulates csgd expression
as c-di-gmp is required for csgd expression, the contribution of c-di-gmp metabolism to regulate csgd expression was investigated for individual ggdef and eal proteins. two ggdef proteins stm <dig> and stm <dig>  and two ggdef-eal proteins stm <dig> and stm <dig>  promote csgd mediated biofilm formation in s. typhimurium umr <dig>  on the other hand, three eal domain proteins stm <dig>  stm <dig> and stm <dig> and the ggdef-eal domain protein stm <dig> suppress csgd expression  <cit> . wild type ggdef domain proteins along with their catalytically inactive variants were overexpressed in the respective chromosomal mutants to assess the impact of catalytic activity. the ggdef domain protein stm <dig> promoted rdar morphotype and csgd expression  when overexpressed in the respective mutant strain, whereas the catalytically inactive variant stm4551e267a, although expressed at the same level as wild type , did not affect rdar morphotype and csgd expression.fig.  <dig> complementation of the rdar morphotype and csgd expression phenotypes of ggdef/eal mutants of s. typhimurium umr <dig>  complementation by the ggdef protein stm <dig>  and the eal protein stm <dig>  in respective mutants. catalytically inactive proteins did not restore csgd expression and the rdar morphotype. c rdar morphotype formation and csgd levels of s. typhimurium umr <dig> upon the chromosomal replacement of the eal to aal motif of eal protein stm <dig>  cells were grown for  <dig> h at 28°c on lb without salt agar plates supplemented with ampicillin  and  <dig> % l-arabinose




overexpression of the eal proteins stm <dig> and stm <dig> suppressed rdar morphotype and csgd expression in the respective chromosomal mutants , whereas the mutants stm3611e136a and stm1827e302a did not exhibit an altered phenotype although mutant proteins were expressed at the same levels as wild type . these findings suggest that the action of stm <dig> and stm <dig> as suppressors of csgd expression is due to their c-di-gmp phosphodiesterase activity. a partial effect of the stm <dig> protein scaffold on csgd expression cannot be excluded at this stage, though.

expression of the ggdef-eal domain protein stm <dig> from pbad <dig> promotes rdar morphotype formation and csgd expression  due to its diguanylate cyclase activity. the catalytically inactive ggdef domain mutant stm3388d342a suppressed rdar morphotype and csgd expression slightly, suggesting a minor phosphodiesterase activity. similarly, expression of stm3388e467a, which contains a mutated eal motif, slightly promotes rdar morphotype and csgd expression. although protein expression data are missing, these results are consistent with reported apparent time dependent diguanylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase activity of the ggdef-eal domain protein stm <dig>  <cit> . a deletion mutant of stm <dig> showed enhanced csgd expression in early growth phase which was diminished later in the growth phase.fig.  <dig> the ggdef-eal domain protein stm <dig> promotes csgd expression through its diguanylate cyclase activity, whereas the ggdef-eal domain protein stm <dig> suppresses csgd expression through its phosphodiesterase activity. a rdar morphotype and csgd levels upon expression of wild type stm <dig> and catalytic ggdef and eal mutants of stm <dig> in stm <dig> deletion mutant of s. typhimurium umr <dig>  b rdar morphotype and csgd levels upon overexpression of stm <dig> and catalytic mutants of stm <dig> in the stm <dig> deletion background of s. typhimurium umr <dig>  cells were grown for  <dig> h at 28°c on lb without salt agar plates supplemented with ampicillin  and  <dig> % l-arabinose. vc = vector control pbad30




the ggdef-eal domain protein stm <dig> is a phenotypic diguanylate cyclase  <cit> , consistent with bioinformatic analysis, which predicts a catalytically functional ggdef domain and a non-functional eal domain  <cit> . over expression of stm <dig> enhanced csgd expression and c-di-gmp levels  <cit> . however, reassessment of the cloned stm <dig> gene revealed a deletion of  <dig> amino acids at the c-terminus. expression of full length stm <dig> and its ggdef mutant stm2123d651a and i site mutant stm2123r640a did not promote rdar morphotype and csgd expression at different arabinose concentrations up to  <dig> % . in summary, at least two ggdef proteins stm <dig> and stm <dig> contribute to csgd expression through c-di-gmp turnover. the ggdef protein stm <dig> could not be cloned without mutation and was therefore excluded from the analysis.

the ggdef-eal protein stm <dig> displays apparent phosphodiesterase activity  <cit> , although bioinformatic analysis predicts a catalytically functional ggdef and eal domain. a catalytic mutant in the ggdef motif, stm1703d313a, however, displays down regulation of the rdar morphotype compared to the wild type protein suggesting an active diguanylate cyclase . amino acid exchange of eal to aal motif abolished phosphodiesterase activity in all eal domain proteins examined previously  <cit> . the 1703e437a mutant still down regulates the rdar morphotype and csgd expression equally as mutants stm1703e527a and stm1703e613a . the catalytic mutants of stm <dig> are equally expressed as wild type protein except stm1703k578a, which did not show functionality . interestingly, upon expression of stm1703e437a in the s. typhimurium umr <dig> background, rdar morphotype downregulation was not observed, while stm1703e527a and 1703e613a still displayed downregulation of the rdar morphotype . these findings suggest a complex role of stm <dig> in csgd regulation dependent on the enzymatic activity and the protein scaffold.

the eal domain protein stm <dig> could not be cloned without mutation. a scar less single amino acid replacement of the glutamate in the eal motif led to enhanced rdar morphotype and csgd expression  similar to the deletion mutant of stm <dig>  taken together, these findings indicate that the phosphodiesterase activities of stm <dig>  stm <dig> and stm <dig> are required to suppress rdar morphotype formation and csgd expression while the situation with respect to stm <dig> is more complex. the ggdef and eal proteins and respective catalytic mutants are summarized in additional file 2: figure s <dig> 

modulation of csgd expression by a complex network of ggdef/eal domain proteins
occurrence of multiple diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases dedicated to csgd regulation raises the question whether these proteins operate in specific combination i.e.: do specific phosphodiesterases degrade c-di-gmp synthesized by specific diguanylate cyclases? to identify corresponding diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases, eal proteins were deleted in the background of ggdef deletion mutants. if the deleted phosphodiesterase is solely or mainly required for degrading c-di-gmp produced by the deleted diguanylate cyclase, no increase in csgd expression is observed. enhancement of csgd expression upon phosphodiesterase deletion in the strain background of deleted diguanylate cyclase indicates no counteraction of the c-di-gmp pool. deletion of stm <dig> in the stm <dig> and stm <dig> mutants enhanced rdar morphotype and csgd expression whereas its deletion in the stm <dig> stm <dig> double mutant did not have this effect  suggesting that stm <dig> degrades the c-di-gmp synthesized by the ggdef domain stm <dig> and stm <dig>  the specificity of stm <dig> towards stm <dig> and stm <dig> is consistent with the role of these proteins in motility regulation  <cit> .fig.  <dig> corresponding ggdef/eal domain proteins. rdar morphotype and csgd levels of s. typhimurium umr <dig> upon deletion of the eal domain protein stm <dig> , the ggdef-eal protein stm <dig> , and the eal protein stm <dig>  in different diguanylate cyclase mutant backgrounds. alteration in rdar morphotype upon adra deletion is due to lack of cellulose synthesis. stereomicroscopic image of the rdar morphotype formation of the stm <dig> mutant upon the deletion of four diguanylate cyclases after  <dig> h of growth at 28°c on lb without salts plates supplemented with congo red  and without congo red . captions  1 = umr1Δ <dig>  2 = umr1Δ3611Δ <dig>  3 = umr1Δ <dig>  4 = umr1Δ3611Δ <dig>  5 = umr1Δ4551Δ <dig>  6 = umr1Δ3611Δ4551Δ <dig>  b 1 = umr1Δ <dig>  2 = umr1Δ4551Δ1987Δ2123Δ <dig>  3 = umr1Δ1703Δ <dig> Δ1987Δ2123Δ <dig>  4 = Δ1703Δadra 5 = Δ1703ΔadraΔ1283Δ <dig>  c 1 = umri, 2 = umr1Δ <dig>  3 = umr <dig> Δ2123Δ <dig>  4 = umr1Δ4264Δ2123Δ <dig>  5 = umr1Δ4551Δ <dig>  6 = umr1Δ4264Δ4551Δ <dig>  7 = umr1Δ4551Δ1987Δ2123Δ <dig>  8 = umr1Δ4264Δ4551Δ1987Δ2123Δ3388




deletion of the ggdef-eal protein stm <dig> in the Δ4dgc mutant background invariably showed rdar morphotype formation and csgd expression as the stm <dig> single mutant . furthermore, combined deletion of stm <dig> and the remaining diguanylate cyclases stm <dig>  stm <dig>  and adra did not diminish csgd expression below the level of the stm <dig> mutant. this finding leads to the hypothesis that stm <dig> degrades c-di-gmp produced from its own ggdef domain, acting as a diguanylate cyclase locally while it might form a complex with a high affinity c-di-gmp receptor .

deletion of the phosphodiesterase stm <dig> in the Δ4dgc mutant enhanced rdar morphotype and csgd expression to the level of the umr <dig> wild type  suggesting an additional source of c-di-gmp to contribute to csgd expression. stereomicroscopic visualization of the rdar morphotype of the stm <dig> mutant with deletion of the four diguanylate cyclases  indicates a 3-d colony architecture different from umr <dig> although csgd expression is at almost similar levels indicating the distinct role of individual c-di-gmp turn over proteins in development of the rdar colony . interestingly, 3-d architecture of s. typhimurium umr <dig> and mutant strains is more pronounced on lb without salt agar plates as compared to lb without salt plates supplemented with congo red and brilliant blue g , which indicates a negative effect of these dyes on rdar morphotype formation.

deletion of stm <dig> from single and double mutants of diguanylate cyclases did alter neither rdar morphotype nor csgd expression  indicating that stm <dig> contributes to degradation of the global c-di-gmp pool only to some extent.

c-di-gmp signalling regulates csgd expression at multiple levels
we previously proposed transcriptional, posttranscriptional and posttranslational control of csgd expression by c-di-gmp  <cit> . here, we investigated the target process of c-di-gmp mediated csgd expression under physiologically relevant changes in c-di-gmp levels in the Δ4dgc mutant as well as in stm <dig> and stm <dig> deletion mutants from transcriptional regulation to functionality of csgd.

using csgd promoter fusions to beta galactosidase that comprise the entire promoter region, utr and part of the open reading frame from - <dig> to +441bp  indicated statistically significant enhancement of csgd promoter activity compared to the single csgd deletion background upon deletion of stm <dig>  whereas deletion of stm <dig> tends to increase promoter activity . in contrast, the deletion of the  <dig> dgcs had no effect on csgd transcription . these results are consistent with previous reports of stm <dig> to affect csgd transcription  <cit> . the c-di-gmp pool degraded by stm <dig> and produced by  <dig> dgcs probably affects mainly posttranscriptional events beyond the fusion construct such as mrna processing and stability.fig.  <dig> effect of c-di-gmp on csgd transcription in the s. typhimurium csgd mutant background. a schematic drawing of fusion constructs containing the csgd promoter region of different length. transcriptional activity of the csgd promoter region was analyzed in puge <dig>  <cit>   upon deletion of stm <dig> and stm <dig> and  upon deletion of four diguanylate cyclases  compared to the respective Δcsgd::km background the transcriptional activity was not affected in the Δ4dgc mutant whereas enhanced β-galactosidase activity was observed in Δ <dig> compared to Δcsgd: <dig>  d-f identification of the stm <dig> regulatory region. as enhanced activity was observed only for puge <dig>  but not for other fusions, stm <dig> acts via the upstream region between nt − <dig> and − <dig>  controls were Δryeb with partial reduction of csgd transcription  <cit>  and Δompr mutant as negative control. β-galactosidase measurements were done in duplicates using at least three technical replicates. statistical significance is indicated by *p <  <dig>  as compared to the respective Δcsgd wild type control using unpaired t-test 




to narrow down the c-di-gmp responsive regulatory region within the csgd upstream region in respect to stm <dig>  ß-galactosidase assays were performed with promoter fusions with subsequent extensions of the csgd promoter region  and  <cit> . in summary, the results show that stm <dig> acts on csgd expression in a distinct region, which could be traced between − <dig> and − <dig> upstream to the transcriptional start site of csgd.

investigating the expression of csgd from pbad <dig> in different ggdef/eal mutant backgrounds did not reveal an effect of c-di-gmp . assessment of csgd functionality, assessed through its effect on adra transcription in different mutant backgrounds did not show an effect of c-di-gmp . this finding indicates that the function of csgd is not dependent on c-di-gmp levels. however, chromosomal over expression of stm <dig> suppresses the expression of csgd . cumulatively, these findings suggest that c-di-gmp enhances csgd expression by acting on multiple levels. involvement of ggdef/eal domain proteins in regulation of csgd expression is summarized in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> overexpression of the pde stm <dig> from chromosome under lacuv <dig> promoter suppresses csgd production and rdar morphotype formation. csgd expression  and rdar morphotype formation  upon overexpressing csgd from pbad <dig> in s. typhimurium strain mae <dig> where stm <dig> is expressed from the constitutive lacuv <dig> promoter as compared to the Δcsgd: <dig> deletion strain mae50

discussion
previously, we identified a role for ggdef/eal proteins in regulation of csgd expression and rdar morphotype formation in s. typhimurium  <cit> . in the present study, we showed that, in most instances, the catalytic activity of ggdef/eal domain proteins is required for the regulation of rdar morphotype and csgd expression. in addition, networks of corresponding c-di-gmp metabolizing proteins were identified.

ggdef/eal domain proteins can regulate biofilm formation through their enzymatic activities, but also, independently, through protein-protein interactions. for example, eal domain proteins stm <dig> and stm <dig> are enzymatically inactive, but contribute to csgd and rdar morphotype expression by interacting with the flhd <dig> subunit of flhd2c <dig>  the master regulator of flagella biogenesis in s. typhimurium  <cit> . similarly, gdps, a ggdef domain protein in staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, does not exhibit diguanylate cyclase activity, but is nevertheless required for biofilm formation and expression of the extracellular matrix polysaccharide pag   <cit> . moreover, the bluf-eal domain protein ycgf of e. coli does not exhibit phosphodiesterase activity, but contributes to expression of colonic acid and repression of curli fimbriae  <cit> . furthermore, ggdef/eal domain proteins regulate rdar formation and csgd expression through their enzymatic activities by c-di-gmp turnover with the exception of stm <dig>  this is in contrast to the previous preposition that csgd expression requires the ggdef domain protein stm <dig>  but not its catalytic activity  <cit> .

an additional role of the ggdef proteins stm <dig> and stm <dig> in csgd expression has been identified, those proteins were previously known only to stimulate cellulose production  <cit> .

bphg <dig>  a ggdef-eal domain protein of rhodobacter sphaeroides, scrc of vibrio cholerae and msdgc <dig> of mycobacterium tuberculosis are bi-functional ggdef-eal domain proteins  <cit> . in this study, we confirm a bi-functional enzymatic activity of the ggdef-eal domain protein stm <dig> in vivo through construction of mutant proteins.

occurrence of multiple c-di-gmp metabolizing proteins in bacterial species raises the question of target specificity. although eight of the ggdef/eal domain proteins are found to be involved in the regulation of csgd expression, indications for local regulation exists. particularly, elevated level of csgd in the stm <dig> mutant could not be restored upon the deletion of several diguanylate cyclases suggesting that the regulation of csgd by stm <dig> can occur locally. this unconventional behavior of stm <dig> led us to hypothesize that stm <dig> forms a complex with a high affinity c-di-gmp receptor. complex formation of ggdef/eal domain proteins with c-di-gmp receptors to regulate target processes locally occurs in e. coli where the c-di-gmp effector pnpase is physically associated with the diguanylate cyclase dosc and the phosphodiesterase dosp in the rna degradosome  <cit> . recently, the stm <dig> homologue in e. coli has been proposed to function as a trigger protein, which senses and effectively degrades c-di-gmp produced upstream in the regulatory cascade thereby releasing inhibition of the diguanylate cyclase ydam and the transcriptional regulator mlra  <cit> . however, in s. typhimurium, a diguanylate cyclase corresponding to ydam is not present. also, the promoter upstream region that mediates stm <dig> dependent csgd regulation from − <dig> to − <dig> does not correspond to the putative mlra binding site, which we identified to be located at nts − <dig> to − <dig>  of note, we were unable to delete mlra in s. typhimurium umr <dig>  but overexpression of mlra showed the previously reported phenotype of csgd upregulation  <cit> .

on the other hand, the additive effect of the four diguanylate cyclases on down regulation of rdar morphotype and csgd expression in the deletion mutant of the phosphodiesterase stm <dig> suggests a global impact of c-di-gmp on csgd expression regulated by this phosphodiesterase. this is consistent with c-di-gmp levels to be substantially elevated upon deletion of stm <dig>  whereas deletion of stm <dig> leads only to a marginal increase of c-di-gmp, despite higher csgd expression in the stm <dig> mutant  <cit> . similarly, vpst, a member of the luxr-csgd family in v. cholerae, is regulated by a global pool of c-di-gmp assembled by at least five diguanylate cyclases  <cit> .

vpst is not only regulated by c-di-gmp at multiple levels, but is also able to bind c-di-gmp to efficiently regulate transcription of target genes  <cit> . in contrast, csgd from enterobacteriaceae lacks the c-di-gmp binding motif  <cit> . the complex regulation of csgd expression by c-di-gmp signalling suggests involvement of more than one c-di-gmp effector in modulation of csgd expression. identification of the c-di-gmp receptors and elucidation of molecular mechanisms leading to c-di-gmp mediated regulation of csgd expression is an interesting subject for follow-up studies.

CONCLUSIONS
several ggedef/eal proteins have recently been shown to regulate target processes through protein-protein interactions. our findings propose that regulation of csgd expression and rdar biofilm development by ggdef/eal domain proteins is mainly, but not exclusively, mediated through the enzymatic activities of the proteins. the diguanylate cyclase activity of ggdef domain proteins contributes to promote csgd expression. thereby, the ggdef proteins stm <dig>  stm <dig>  stm <dig> and stm <dig> have an additive effect on the promotion of csgd expression. moreover, csgd is regulated by c-di-gmp signalling at multiple levels. the ggdef/eal protein stm  <dig> suppresses the transcription of csgd, whereas eal domain stm  <dig> suppresses csgd by acting on post-transcriptional events.

c-di-gmp signalling has recently emerged as an important intracellular tool to promote biofilm formation in a concerted action in many pathogenic and environmental bacterial species. our findings extend the understanding of the mechanisms of the regulation of target processes by c-di-gmp signalling in s. typhimurium.
