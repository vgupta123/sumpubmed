BACKGROUND
for all their remarkable diversity, all insects are faced with a recurring problem during their development: the replacement of a constricting exoskeleton after periods of intermolt growth. the successful solution to this problem is to form a new, larger cuticle beneath the hardened exoskeleton. shedding of the older exoskeleton can only occur once the new cuticle is complete. the cuticle-shedding behaviors collectively known as ecdysis are orchestrated by a suite of interacting peptide hormones including ecdysis-triggering hormone , eclosion hormone  and ccap . the canonical model proposes that eth and eh coupled release initiates the preparatory behaviors of ecdysis; ccap terminates these early behaviors and also serves to trigger the final bouts of shedding the exuvia  <cit> .

upon completion of their final ecdysis , adult drosophila emerge with a soft cuticle and unexpanded wings. while these features are advantageous for confinement within an otherwise too small puparium, they are not adaptive to life outside of the puparium. instead, shortly following eclosion the wings expand to their full size and the new cuticle undergoes sclerotization and melanization  .

several key observations provide evidence that these post-eclosion events are regulated by the heterodimeric neuropeptide bursicon through its receptor, rickets. first, the rickets mutants rk <dig> and rk <dig> are incapable of wing expansion behaviors or tanning their cuticle, even when challenged with hemolymph extracts containing bursicon from newly eclosed wild-type flies  <cit> . similarly, bursicon mutants are unable to successfully execute this phase of post-eclosion development  <cit> . bursicon hormone has been shown to activate the rickets receptor, by increasing downstream camp activity  <cit> , completing the link between hormone signaling and post-eclosion development.

establishing a role for the bursicon signaling pathway preceding eclosion has been more difficult to demonstrate, primarily because rk <dig> and rk <dig> exhibit few if any developmental defects prior to eclosion . however, we wondered if the bursicon signaling pathway performs similar cuticle tanning roles following larval and pupal ecdyses. in support of this possibility, transcripts of rk and the bursicon subunits burs and pburs are found at all stages of post-embryonic development  <cit>  . furthermore, burs subunit immunoreactivity is present in several larval tissues, including cns  <cit>  and peripheral motor neuron terminals  <cit> . recent evidence has also shown that a subset of ccap neurons which co-express bursicon undergo ca2+ changes in their cell bodies during pupal ecdysis , suggesting that these neuropeptides are secreted at this point in ecdysis  <cit> . notably, these same neurons have axonal projections with 'type iii' boutons at the neuromuscular junction   <cit> . thus, it is likely that bursicon is released contemporaneously with ecdyses other than eclosion, although no study has quantified the secretion of any neuropeptide from type iii boutons in larval or pupal stages. the expression of bursicon and its likely release during development are strong indicators of additional functions apart from the post-eclosion events which it is known to regulate. however, these may not be easily deducible with the available burs and rk mutants, none of which result in a complete absence of gene product .

on the other hand, several transgenic studies hint at the possibility that disrupting bursicon signaling during development can have lethal consequences. ectopic expression of the cell death gene reaper in ccap neurons  <cit>   results in two classes of progeny: those flies which eclose exhibit cuticular deformities and unexpanded wings remarkably similar to burs and rk mutants. the other class of progeny are incapable of performing head eversion, a crucial event at pupal ecdysis, and subsequently die as pupae. the defects at head eversion are even more frequent when ccap neuron membrane excitability is suppressed by transgenic expression of a human k+ channel inward rectifier   <cit> . nevertheless, this pupal lethal phenotype should be interpreted with the caveat that ccap neurons express multiple neuropeptide identities, including ccap, bursicon and myoinhibitory peptide  <cit> , which may obscure the cause of the head eversion defect. thus, neither available genetic mutants nor cell ablation studies are a reliable means to elucidate the function of bursicon signaling during development.

alternatively, the function of bursicon/rickets in developing life stages could be examined with rna interference . this method takes advantage of endogenous cellular mechanisms to recognize double-stranded rna  and abolish any identical native transcripts: by introducing transcript-specific dsrna, the expression of a gene of interest can be silenced  <cit> . surprisingly, this technique has not yet been used to experimentally manipulate burs or rk expression in drosophila.

the hormone bursicon  is a key factor in tanning the new cuticle. however, direct and incontrovertible genetic evidence for the functional role of this signaling pathway has only been demonstrated in post-eclosion drosophila. the lack of any pre-eclosion defects in burs and rk mutants may be because these mutations are hypomorphs, or alternatively because the bursicon signaling pathway is not functionally relevant prior to eclosion. to address these distinct possibilities, we examined bursicon's peripheral release from type iii boutons during the 2nd larval and pupal ecdyses. the developmental role of bursicon was also examined by manipulating expression of both bursicon and rickets, via targeted rnai. our results show that bursicon is released during the 2nd larval ecdysis, and strongly suggest that it is released during pupal ecdysis as well. we also show that bursicon and rickets expression are essential during pupal development for viability.

RESULTS
bursicon expression at the larval nmj is limited to type iii boutons
in drosophila, bursicon is produced in a subset of ccap neurons in the cns  <cit> . among this subset, the neuromeres in t <dig>  and a1-a <dig> send motor neuron axons to the type iii boutons of nmj  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . since ccap and bursicon share overlapping expression patterns in the ventral ganglion, it is likely that bursicon is also co-expressed in type iii boutons.

immunoreactivity to the bursicon subunit burs  at a representative larval muscle  <dig> stained with hrp illustrates that bursicon is present in some but not all boutons at nmj  <dig> , which underscores the need to determine which boutons express bursicon. whereas peripheral bursicon immunoreactivity  has previously been demonstrated in both larval and adult preparations  <cit> , its presence in a specific bouton type has not been independently established. to examine whether bursicon is expressed in type iii boutons, we looked for its co-localization with an exogenous gfp marker driven by ccap-gal <dig>  in this case, an emerald-gfp tagged atrial natriuretic factor  construct  <cit>  was used as the marker for type iii boutons. our results indicate that burs-ir co-localized exclusively with anf-emd in type iii boutons , where the ccap-gal <dig> pattern has been previously shown  <cit> .

expression of vesicle membrane proteins in type iii boutons
we were curious whether the bursicon expressed in type iii boutons represents a releasable pool of vesicles. to answer this question, we examined the expression of two pre-synaptic vesicle protein markers in type iii boutons, neuronal synaptobrevin  and cysteine string protein . double-labeling of nmj preparations with bursicon  and n-syb antibodies  demonstrates that n-syb is expressed in type iii boutons , as well as boutons which are devoid of burs-ir . similarly, burs-ir  and csp-ir  co-localize in type iii boutons , with csp-ir also occurring outside of the burs-ir pattern . the presence of n-syb and csp in type iii boutons is consistent with these vesicles being a releasable pool of secretory granules.

secretion of vesicles from type iii boutons before and after larval ecydsis
the observation that the vesicle membrane proteins n-syb and csp are expressed in type iii boutons prompted us to examine if vesicle release occurs during the larval stage. aside from bursicon, hormones such as ccap and mip are expressed in these peptidergic terminals, and have roles in ecdysis and post-ecdysis events. thus, hormone release from the type iii boutons may be contemporaneous with ecdysis. to examine vesicle release in a time window corresponding to ecdysis, we decided to image live transgenic larvae that expressed uas-anf-emd in the ccap-gal <dig> pattern. the anf-emd construct has been used successfully in several studies to monitor vesicle release from secretory cells during endogenous behaviors  <cit> .

while not directly addressing the identity of endogenous hormone release, this technique allowed us to accurately quantify when the type iii boutons release anf-emd, by directly measuring fluorescence intensity fluctuations . we initially examined nmjs t <dig> and a1-a <dig> of ccap>anf-emd animals approaching the second larval ecdysis, and those which had begun secreting eth, regarded as the initial peptide hormone trigger of ecdysis behaviors  <cit> . these two stages can be distinguished on the basis of mouthpart morphology known as 'double mouth hooks'  and 'double vertical plates' , respectively  <cit> . imaging of the dmh stage indicated high levels of anf-emd in type iii boutons. less than two hours later, at the earliest recognizable dvp time, there is an 85% decrease in fluorescence intensity, indicating large-scale secretion. this is a startling result, since no ecdysis-related peptide hormone is currently known to precede the release of eth at the dvp stage. this wave of anf-emd release continues through the end of ecdysis behaviors, until when the 3rd instar larva finally breaks through the old cuticle with a thrusting forward escape  motion  <cit> . the level of anf-emd release at fe represents its lowest expression level, a 96% drop in fluorescence intensity from the initial dmh levels. following this stage, type iii boutons appear to refill with anf-emd. measurements taken two hours after fe have rebounded to a level representing 37% of initial dmh levels, suggesting that refilling has begun . however, within one hour we detected a second decline in fluorescence intensity in type iii boutons: at three hours post-fe  approximately 82% vesicle release has occurred, relative to the preceding stage. thus there appears to be two distinct waves of anf-emd release from type iii boutons, the first preceding eth release at dvp and the second following the completion of ecdysis behaviors at fe. by the wandering 3rd instar stage, the fluorescence intensity has returned to levels seen before ecdysis . single-factor anova tests indicate significant differences between the following stages of larval ecdysis: dmh to dvp ; fe to + <dig> hours ; + <dig> hours to + <dig> hours ; and + <dig> hours to l <dig> . the one stage comparison without a significant difference is dvp to fe . as a control we also examined larvae expressing anf-emd with a pan-neural driver, elav-gal <dig>  examination of normally non-peptidergic type i boutons on nmj 6/ <dig> between dmh and dvp revealed no detectable change in fluorescence intensity in elav>anf-emd animals . this indicates that the changes in the type iii boutons are not the result of large-scale synaptic activity at the nmj.

to confirm whether bursicon is released at a stage which precedes eth release, we dissected wild-type larvae into fillets and tracheae. the larval fillets were stained with anti-burs, whereas the tracheae  were stained with anti-eth. between dmh and dvp stages, we detected that burs-ir significantly decreased by 57% in type iii boutons . this period corresponds with the first wave of release detected in ccap>anf-emd live preparations . in the corresponding tracheae from these animals we were unable to observe a change in eth-ir between dmh and dvp , confirming that eth  has not yet been released. together, these data support our claim that a wave of bursicon release precedes eth release, at the 2nd larval ecdysis.

secretion of vesicles from type iii boutons during pupal ecydsis
we wondered whether at other ecdyses if bursicon release can precede the initiation of ecdysis behaviors. a previous study showed that ca2+ levels rose in ccap neurons at pupal ecdysis, in response to eth  <cit> . using morphologically staged pupae ), we examined this period for anf-emd release from type iii boutons . the p <dig> pupal stage can precede pupal ecdysis by several hours, and here we observed the highest levels of anf-emd fluorescence intensity . within minutes of eth release, the ecdysis sequence begins with pre-ecdysis behaviors, recognized as the eviction of an air bubble in the posterior pupal space  <cit> . this time-point corresponds to our staged p <dig> pupae, in which we observed anf-emd fluorescence levels at the nmj begin to decline, indicating hormone release from type iii boutons . anf-emd fluorescence continues to decline through the completion of head eversion, which shortly follows initiation of ecdysis behaviors ; this time-point corresponds to our staged p <dig> pupae . after the completion of ecdysis behaviors and leg extension, anf-emd fluorescence is almost absent from type iii boutons in p <dig> pupae . our results in figure  <dig> are consistent with large ca2+ increases observed in ccap neurons during the pupal ecdysis sequence . however, since we used the appearance of the posterior air bubble to define p <dig> pupae, we are unable to make any claims about the exact timing of anf-emd release as it relates to eth secretion, as by this time eth secretion has already begun  <cit> .

ubiquitous expression of uas-burs rnai obstructs advancement beyond the pharate adult stage
in the previous sections, we found evidence for release of bursicon from type iii boutons during development. we next wished to perturb its expression in order to probe its developmental role. since burs mutants are viable but do not show an observable mutant phenotype until post-eclosion , we chose to affect burs expression by rna interference . larval development apparently proceeds unimpeded when uas-burs rnai is ubiquitously expressed . however, pharate adults of this genotype were unable to escape from their puparia . although opened opercula were occasionally observed, eclosion was still not possible from the puparium. to confirm a knock-down effect by uas-burs rnai, we labeled act5c>burs rnai larval nmjs with anti-burs antiserum and saw a dramatic decrease in fluorescence intensity, relative to a uas-burs rnai control  . as an additional control, we saw no change in ccap-ir in similar act5c>burs rnai tissue preparations .

ubiquitous expression of uas-rk rnai arrests development
to further explore the functional significance of the bursicon pathway during development, we next examined the role of its receptor, rickets. we chose to address its role by expressing rk rnai widely and screening for resultant phenotypes. in standard growing conditions within food vials, ubiquitous expression of uas-rk rnai  results in progeny that are unable to develop beyond the larval stage, and the few 3rd instar larvae which we recovered often died with a 'double vertical plates' phenotype , indicative of failed larval ecdysis  <cit> . however, if larvae of this genotype are rescued from the food and allowed to mature on grape juice agar plates, progeny can develop until the pupal stage, at which point a range of lethal phenotypes is observed , including pupae that resemble larvae in shape, and pupae that arrest before or shortly after pupal ecdysis. these pupae appear pale in color and are extremely flimsy, suggesting that the puparia have not "tanned". pharate adults are also observed , but they always fail to eclose.

we also examined the effect of the same uas-rk rnai construct when driven by a different act5c-gal <dig> driver -gal4). these progeny primarily die at the pupal stage . the few progeny which eclose resemble rk mutants in that they are unable to tan their cuticle or expand their wings . contrary to classic rk phenotypes, these flies have great difficulty standing. this is likely a consequence of extreme cuticular defects, and all adults die within  <dig> hours of eclosion. the lethal phenotypes which result when uas-rk rnai is driven with either act5c-gal <dig> are consistent with a previous report that the same uas-rk rnai construct is 100% lethal when ubiquitously expressed with act5c-gal <dig>  <cit> . however, these rnai phenotypes were not described, nor was the underlying basis explored. thus, expression of uas-rk rnai with either act5c driver results in pupal lethality.

to confirm that the uas-rk rnai construct does indeed knock down rickets transcript levels, we performed rt-pcr on cdna from pupae of both act5c>rk rnai and uas-rk rnai . the results show that for the expected size of amplified rk cdna, rk transcript levels are undetectable in act5c>rk rnai as compared to the uas-rk rnai control.

the rickets mutations rk <dig> and rk <dig> are more severe as hemizygotes
the homozygous rickets mutants rk <dig> and rk <dig> have previously been described as null mutants  <cit> . consequently, gene silencing by ubiquitous rnai expression should not result in a mutant phenotype that is more severe than expected from a genetic 'loss of function' mutation. surprisingly, the phenotypes documented in figure  <dig> contradict this basic principle in two ways. first, the classic mutant alleles are perfectly viable as homozygous adults, as compared to act5c>rk rnai . second, although cuticle deformations are a hallmark of rickets mutations, neither mutant allele is crippled to the extent of act5c>rk rnai adults . this unanticipated disparity in phenotypes suggests that either ubiquitous expression of uas-rk rnai has unintended consequences in addition to silencing of the rickets gene, or that rk <dig> and rk <dig> alleles do not truly represent genetic null mutants.

the rk <dig> and rk <dig> mutants were originally defined as nulls on the basis that the heteroallelic combination of two distinct cytologically defined deletions which incompletely overlap with rickets is indistinguishable from homozygous rk <dig> and rk <dig> adults  <cit> . since the deficiencies used are no longer available, we were unable to assay these alleles in this fashion. to test if the rk alleles are homozygous nulls, we created hemizygotes by crossing either rk <dig> or rk <dig> to dfbsc252/cyo. importantly, the dfbsc <dig> deficiency contains molecularly defined breakpoints which delete rk in its entirety  <cit>  . in this scenario, hemizygous mutants, whether rk1/df or rk4/df, can only display a more severe mutant phenotype than homozygous rk <dig> and rk <dig> flies if these are not loss of function alleles. to test this hypothesis we had to select a suitable trait that might be enhanced when rk is hemizygous with dfbsc <dig>  for example, the complete penetrance of unextended wings in rk <dig> and rk <dig> makes this trait uninformative to score in a loss of function test. indeed, the wings of both rk1/df and rk4/df flies are indistinguishable from the respective homozygous mutant alleles . another aspect of the rickets mutant phenotype occurs with reduced penetrance: both rk <dig> and rk <dig> flies can exhibit a range of leg deformities including bowed femora and flattened tarsal segments  <cit> . we hypothesized that the reduced penetrance of leg deformities in homozygous mutants could be enhanced in hemizygous mutants. to determine the severity of rickets disruption, we scored deformities in metathoracic legs of both homozygous and hemizygous rk <dig> and rk <dig> flies. in a random sampling of homozygous rk <dig> legs ,  <dig> % are normal,  <dig> % exhibit moderately kinked tarsi, and only  <dig> % have severely kinked legs . remarkably, 100% of rk1/df flies have severe tarsal deformities, representing a greater-than 19-fold increase. a less drastic transformation was seen in our parallel rk <dig> study: whereas 100% of homozygous rk <dig> legs have tarsi with no defects , 2/ <dig> of legs from rk4/df flies  were scored with tarsal deformities .

a number of uneclosed rk1/df progeny were also observed. could developmental lethality be affected in rk <dig> hemizygotes? we addressed this question by crossing rk <dig> to dfbsc252/cyo, actgfp, to distinguish between heterozygous and hemizygous rk <dig> pupae. as expected, roughly equal numbers of rk1/df  and rk1/cyo, actgfp pupae  were obtained. however, only  <dig> %  of rk1/df flies eclosed, as compared to  <dig> %  of rk1/cyo, actgfp. in a parallel study, we compared developmental lethality in homozygous rk <dig> and heterozygous rk1/+ flies. in this case, crossing the homozygous rk <dig> stock to rk1/+ results in similar numbers of viable rk <dig>  and rk1/+  adult flies, and no uneclosed pupae. these two experiments bolster our claim that rk1/df is indeed a stronger disruption of rickets function than homozygous rk <dig> by itself. the decreased eclosion rate in rk1/df appears to be due to an inability in otherwise healthy looking pharate adults to escape from the puparium.

we conclude that rk <dig> does not represent a null allele when leg morphology and developmental lethality are taken into account. therefore it is not unreasonable for act5c>rk rnai to display more severe phenotypes than the available homozygous rk mutant alleles.

rickets expression is required in developing epidermal tissue and imaginal discs
as a prelude to manipulating rickets expression by rnai with more selective gal <dig> drivers, we asked where rickets might normally be expressed during development. a recent large-scale gene expression study has identified rickets transcripts in several tissues during development by microarray  <cit> . in their study, two larval tissues had higher levels of rk transcripts: the cns and the fat body. in addition to these tissues, we reasoned that since bursicon acts on the epidermis to tan the cuticle , rk may be expressed developmentally in epidermal tissue, or in tissue that eventually forms adult structures . these data suggest that targeted uas-rk rnai expression in separate tissues could reveal developmental requirements for rickets expression, as assayed by their mutant phenotypes. to test this hypothesis, we crossed uas-rk rnai to neural , peptidergic  and fat body  gal <dig> lines. with the above gal <dig> drivers, expression of rk rnai generated flies that appeared healthy and indistinguishable from wild-type flies . we conclude that rk rnai in cns, peptidergic neurons, or fat body alone is insufficient to generate rickets-like phenotypes.

in contrast, expression of uas-rk rnai by gal <dig> lines with reported epidermal and/or imaginal disc expression patterns  produced several different mutant phenotypes. the observed rk rnai phenotypes were dependent on the specific gal <dig> driver. the resulting animals ranged from those unable to complete the prepupal stage, to healthy adult flies. for example, uas-rk rnai expression with t76-gal <dig> results in 100% lethality prior to pupal ecdysis. from this genotype we only observed animals in small, misshapen and untanned puparia . two separate drivers, t80-gal <dig> and 69b-gal <dig>  give nearly identical results with uas-rk rnai, though less severe than with t76-gal <dig>  all t80>rk rnai and most 69b>rk rnai progeny die as pharate adults . apart from their failure to eclose, these progeny appear otherwise normal. occasionally, adult 69b>rk rnai "escapers" are observed . their untanned cuticle and unexpanded wings are reminiscent of rk mutants, yet severe cuticular defects in 69b>rk rnai adults result in legs which cannot support their body weight. the absence of mobility in these flies likely contributes to their death within  <dig> hours after eclosion. expression of rk rnai with c855a-gal <dig> does not effect the ability of progeny to eclose . however, all c855a>rk rnai progeny show great difficulty walking and climbing, as manifested by dragging their metathoracic legs during locomotion. a closer inspection of their leg morphology revealed kinked metathoracic tarsi which phenocopy the legs of rk1/df flies . unlike rk1/df flies, c855a>rk rnai flies are able to expand their wings. somewhat surprisingly, these wings never become rigid, resulting in a sagging appearance . we also analyzed uas-rk rnai expression with mj33a-gal4; these flies are healthy and indistinguishable from wild-type controls .

the variability in rnai phenotypes that we observed is likely due to tissue-specific rk requirements. to determine where rk rnai expression results in mutant phenotypes, we expressed uas-mcd8::gfp and analyzed gal <dig> lines for their expression pattern and relative levels in the larval cns, imaginal discs, and epidermis. in the cns  there is either a strong solid pattern, as in act5c, t <dig>  t <dig>  and 69b, or expression is severely restricted as in c855a and mj33a .

the expression patterns of t <dig>  69b and c855a are summarized in figure  <dig>  along with their respective rnai phenotypes. among these drivers, t <dig> is unique in having strong, uniform expression in the larval epidermis . this suggests that rk rnai expression in  the epidermis adversely affects puparium  formation . the epidermal expression pattern of 69b is weak and restricted to isolated patches, but there is strong solid expression in the imaginal discs . interestingly, we also observed abnormal leg shrugging in 69b>rk rnai animals which fail to eclose. the eclosion defect may result from the inability to utilize the legs in extrication behaviors . in combination with the flaccid leg phenotype in eclosed 69b>rk rnai flies, these observations implicate a requirement for rk in strengthening the cuticle of legs before eclosion. all assayed tissue patterns are more restricted in c855a-gal <dig> . imaginal discs and cns show highly restricted patterns, but no expression is observed in the epidermis. these patterns imply that the limited rk rnai expression in cns and imaginal discs permits wing expansion without subsequent tanning.

discussion
there is no question that the hormone bursicon, acting through its receptor rickets, is responsible for several post-eclosion events in drosophila: deploying wing expansion behaviors  <cit> , and plasticization and tanning of the new cuticle  <cit> . however, no cuticular tanning function earlier in development has yet been convincingly demonstrated. to our knowledge, ours is the first study in drosophila to quantify the peripheral release of bursicon during the larval stage, and to experimentally manipulate targets of bursicon to investigate the role of this "tanning hormone" prior to eclosion.

to do so, we first wanted to confirm where bursicon is expressed and released in the periphery during development. while we were able to document bursicon release from larval type iii boutons by immunocytochemistry, we also found this method to be difficult to perform quantitatively. the greatest obstacle to this approach is titrating the concentration of primary and secondary antibodies to 'biologically relevant' levels . instead, we favored in vivo measurements which exploit the uas-anf-emd construct, which codes for the rat anf prepropeptide tagged with the emerald variant of gfp  <cit> . importantly, this ectopic neuropeptide also has no biological activity in drosophila. the anf-emd marker has been used on numerous occasions to monitor vesicular release in drosophila  <cit> , and has become an effective method to study hormone release during an endogenously performed behavior  <cit> . of these behavioral studies, one of the most convincing uses of uas-anf-emd focused on its release from ccap neurons in the ventral ganglion  <cit> . preparations were compared at times before and after the 2nd larval ecdysis, and the decrease in anf-emd fluorescence corresponded with a previously observed decrease in ccap immunoreactivity between these same stages  <cit> . thus measuring fluorescence dynamics in cells expressing uas-anf-emd is a reliable method for studying the relationship between a behavior and the underlying hormonal release.

our results indicating anf-emd release following larval ecdysis are consistent with a role for bursicon in tanning the new cuticle  <cit> . strikingly, we also observed a significant amount of anf-emd release earlier, between the dmh and dvp stages. at the 2nd larval ecdysis, the dmh stage can precede dvp  by up to  <dig> hours, with the end of ecdysis occurring approximately  <dig> minutes after dvp .

taken together, the burs-ir and anf-emd fluorescence dynamics initiated between dmh and dvp stages represent bursicon release at the nmj, preceding eth release. this is in direct contrast to the current model of the neuroendocrine regulation of ecdysis, which places eth release at the top of the sequence  <cit> . it is not clear if our observed pre-dvp bursicon release could be part of the actual neuroendocrine cascade that regulates ecdysis behaviors, or if it is released in parallel. one possibility is that this initial phase of bursicon release in larvae is used to tan the new mouthparts. however, we never observed un-tanned mouthparts in larvae expressing either burs rnai or rk rnai.

another possibility is that our release data may include an unknown role for the burs subunit. to detect bursicon, we used an antibody to the burs subunit, although the active bursicon hormone is a heterodimer of both burs and pburs  <cit> . furthermore, among the type iii boutons that we sampled for fluorescence intensity are those that receive projections from neuromere t <dig>  which express the burs subunit but not pburs  <cit> . it is currently unknown if burs has any function in the absence of pburs , so we cannot rule out the possibility that our analyses include more than just heterodimeric bursicon release. nevertheless, our results demonstrate that the type iii boutons actively release vesicles at developmentally relevant time points. future functional studies should be directed at deciphering the role of hormones secreted from type iii boutons, especially just prior to the second larval ecdysis.

following the demonstration that bursicon is released in drosophila during development, we focused on its role at target tissues during development. to do so, we relied on the use of a transgenic rnai construct to disrupt rickets expression in separate tissue domains. similarly, a recent study in drosophila also effectively used targeted rnai against 'sex peptide receptor' to define specific neurons in females that are required for the behavioral response to 'sex peptide'  <cit> . in retrospect our transgenic approach was also necessary to sufficiently silence rk expression, relative to available rk mutants. our analysis of rk <dig> and rk <dig> provides clear genetic evidence that they are not null mutants. by focusing on leg deformities , we were able to show that both rk <dig> and rk <dig> hemizygotes are afflicted with much more severe leg deformities. these results underscore the utility of rnai in gene disruption studies, even when genetic mutants are available.

the ability to enhance the penetrance of deformed leg segments when rk alleles are hemizygous with the dfbsc <dig> deletion also suggests that some aspect of signal transduction is retained in rk mutants. signal transduction in the rickets receptor activates pka, through increasing camp levels  <cit> . recently, post-eclosion tanning has been linked to phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase  by pka, as a result of rickets activation  <cit> . a detectable th activity profile in rk <dig> pupae and adults follows the same pattern as th activity in wild-type animals, yet at an attenuated level . although th activity is an indirect measurement of rickets activation, we feel that the trend in th activity shown by rk <dig> pupae is in accordance with our view that rk alleles are not complete loss of function mutations.

by contrast, we currently do not know how the rk mutations could retain functionality, since they contain stop codons which should critically truncate the protein upstream of the transmembrane domain  or within the transmembrane domain   <cit> . one possible scenario is that read-through of the stop codons is occurring at some level in these animals. the existence of this phenomenon has previously been demonstrated in drosophila, in a rigorous analysis of read-through in the synapsin gene  <cit> . to confirm a similar situation in rk mutants would require antibodies that recognize the rickets protein on either side of the stop codon. regardless, a more thorough analysis of the function of rickets will have to await a mutation which exclusively removes its entire coding sequence.

the determination that rk mutants are not nulls validates our use of rk rnai, which effectively reduces rk transcript levels, and is lethal when expressed ubiquitously. conveniently, the rk rnai phenotypes we observed with more selective gal <dig> lines  are consistent with a role for bursicon signaling at the epidermis to mediate cuticle tanning . even so, our results were still unexpected. as in some act5c>rk rnai pupae, t76>rk rnai have a terminal phenotype with small, soft, misshapen puparia. we believe this is due to disrupted rk expression in the epidermis. t76>rk rnai prepupae never advance to a point where a distinct pupa can be observed, which also suggests that rk expression in the epidermis may be important in formation of the developing pupal cuticle. the soft, flexible puparium observed in t76>rk rnai is especially intriguing, since bursicon signaling has never before been directly linked to pupariation. hardening of the puparium in diptera is instead believed to be regulated by another peptide hormone, the "puparium tanning factor"  <cit> , which has been identified as a pyrokinin in the grey flesh fly   <cit> .

two genotypes resulted in trapped pharate adults that were unable to eclose: t80>rk rnai and 69b>rk rnai. fortuitously, we observed 69b>rk rnai flies attempting to eclose, and a small fraction of these animals were successful. based on the gal <dig> expression patterns in imaginal discs of t <dig> and 69b, we hypothesize that rk is required to sclerotize the cuticle, and in particular the legs, during the pharate adult stage. the resulting legs of 69b>rk rnai flies which successfully eclose are extremely flaccid and unable to support the weight of the fly . although leg movements have not been shown to be required for eclosion , we believe that the failure to eclose in the majority of 69b>rk rnai flies may be due to their flaccid legs. mature 69b>rk rnai pharate adults that failed to eclose exhibited abnormal leg shifting movements within the puparium. these consisted of coxal shrugging movements, accompanied by displacement of the femora with slipping movements. previous results in the tobacco hornworm manduca sexta  <cit>  and also in sarcophaga bullata  <cit>  indicate that restraint of the legs are important stimuli to elicit extrication from the pupal case. since the legs are defective in 69b>rk rnai animals, the absence of this crucial leg restraint signal may lead to the observed failure at eclosion.

we also showed that a more restricted gal <dig> pattern can result in less severe rnai phenotypes. this is exemplified by c855a>rk rnai flies, which succeed in expanding their wings following eclosion. curiously the wings never harden, giving all c855a>rk rnai wings a unique sagging appearance. examination of the c855a expression pattern revealed limited cns expression, especially in the vns, whereas bursicon signaling within the cns is required to deploy wing expansion behaviors  <cit> . perhaps rnai can be used in future studies to determine the cns targets in this pathway with greater accuracy. to account for the "sagging wing" phenotype, the reduced expression pattern in c855a wing discs  is evidently sufficient to disrupt tanning in the wings of c855a>rk rnai. finally, mj33a>rk rnai flies appeared normal, and from this we assume that their greatly restricted expression patterns in cns, imaginal discs and epidermis are insufficient for disrupting rk expression.

the peptide hormones which regulate ecdysis may interact in complicated ways which do not fit into a linear model of causation . here, we have shown that rickets activity, traditionally placed after eclosion, also has unexpected roles in tanning the puparium and strengthening pharate adult cuticle. these observations would not have been possible without silencing rk expression in tissues where it is required to respond to bursicon. it is noteworthy here to mention a recent study which examined the roles of all ecydsis-related peptide hormones and their receptors in the flour beetle tribolium castaneum, using systemic rnai  <cit> . apart from effecting cuticular tanning, this study revealed that injections of burs/pburs or rk rnai into pharate pupae resulted in diminished strength of contractions at pre-ecdysis. our own study clearly indicates that rickets plays a central role prior to eclosion.

CONCLUSIONS
our results redefine bursicon signaling as an essential pathway during drosophila development. we present new evidence during larval ecdysis that bursicon secretion precedes the canonical ecydsis cascade of neuropeptide regulation. furthermore, ubiquitous inhibition of bursicon expression results in 100% lethality by the pharate adult stage, thus preventing eclosion. finally, rickets expression in the epidermis/imaginal discs is crucial for drosophila development, especially during the pupal stage. these results indicate that bursicon activity is not confined to post-eclosion development in drosophila, as previously postulated.
