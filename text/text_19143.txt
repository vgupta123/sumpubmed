BACKGROUND
diabetes mellitus is a common name for a group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion and/or action. hyperglycemia and other related metabolic disturbances can lead to serious damage to various systems of the body, especially nerves and blood vessels. statistical data show that the excess global mortality attributable to diabetes in the year  <dig> was  <dig> % of all deaths  <cit> , while its prevalence for all age-groups worldwide was expected to increase from  <dig> % in  <dig> to  <dig> % in  <dig>  <cit> . the most frequent forms of diabetes mellitus are type  <dig> diabetes  and type  <dig> diabetes .

t2d is classically considered to be a metabolic disease characterized by insulin resistance and additional disorders, such as pancreatic beta cell dysfunction and decrease in beta cell mass, which intensively contribute to the disease course  <cit> . one major reason for insulin resistance in t2d is obesity  <cit> , which is associated with high glucose and free fatty acid levels circulating throughout the body affecting various cell types including pancreatic beta cells  <cit> . it is well known that hyperlipidemia contributes to t2d pathogenesis  <cit> , and that high concentrations of saturated fatty acids, including palmitic acid , lead to impairment of insulin action and beta-cell dysfunction  <cit> . increased adiposity enhances adipose tissue secretion of cytokines, such as tnf-α, il-1β and il- <dig> which are cytotoxic to beta cells, as well as production of adipokines, including leptin, resistin, and adiponectin, which have a cytoprotective role in cytokine and free fatty acid-induced beta cell destruction  <cit> . obesity and insulin resistance have been frequently associated with a state of low-grade inflammation and therefore it is assumed that inflammation contributes in a major way to the development of t2d  <cit> . an accumulating set of data supporting this assumption includes findings of inflammation-related changes, such as amyloid deposits and fibrosis, increased beta cell death and the presence of leukocyte infiltrates in the pancreata of t2d patients and animals  <cit> . additionally, it is becoming increasingly clear that obesity is also an important predisposing factor for t1d  <cit> , a disease with proposed autoimmune etiopathology, in which immune cells infiltrate the endocrine pancreas and cause beta cell destruction  <cit> . the means by which macrophages and t cells exert their cytotoxic actions upon beta cells are rather well established and comprise various soluble mediators, such as oxygen free radicals, nitric oxide  and cytokines, including il-1β, il- <dig>  ifn-γ and tnf-α, but the primal target of the autoimmune attack has not yet been defined  <cit> . it has been suggested that physiological beta cell turnover may expose specific tissue antigens that are carried to the draining lymph nodes by infiltrating macrophages  <cit> . importantly, this initial turnover may be a consequence of obesity, i.e. hyperlipidemia or the excess production of cytokines in adipose tissues  <cit> .

thus, in the present paper we investigated the interaction between one of the most common free fatty acid – pa and soluble immune cell products, as they have individually been shown to be deleterious for beta cells  <cit> , but their joint effect on beta cells has not been investigated so far. here, we demonstrate that pa and soluble products of t cells cooperate in beta cell destruction in vitro. we show that they trigger caspase-3-mediated, no-dependent apoptosis in rat insulinoma cells through activation of p <dig> mitogen-activated protein-kinase .

cell viability assay
in order to asses the viability of rin cells, pancreatic islets or lnc we used the mitochondrial-dependent reduction of 3-- <dig> -diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide  to formazan. at the end of appropriate treatments, cell culture supernatants were removed from the plates and mtt solution  was applied. alternatively, pancreatic islets were collected in tubes, spun down, supernatants removed and the cell pellet dissolved in the mtt solution. finally, in co-cultivation experiments, lnc were removed from cell cultures, spun down, supernatants removed and the residue dissolved in mtt solution. mtt solution was also added to the rin cells remaining in the plates. incubation with mtt lasted for  <dig> minutes at 37°c. dimethyl sulfoxide  was added to the pellet of pancreatic islets, to lnc and to plated rin cells to dissolve the formazan crystals. the absorbance was measured at  <dig> nm, with a correction at  <dig> nm, using an automated microplate reader .

RESULTS
cooperative effect of pa and activated immune cell products on rat pancreatic beta cell viability
we co-cultivated rin cells and rat lymph node cells  stimulated with cona  in the absence or presence of pa. in preliminary experiments the pa concentration of  <dig> μm had a significant, yet limited effect on rin cell viability , so this dose was used in subsequent experiments. after  <dig> hours of treatment, either pa or activated lnc decreased rin cell viability, but the effect was markedly greater if rin cells were co-cultivated with activated lnc in the presence of pa . interestingly, if direct rin-to-lnc contact was prevented with tissue culture inserts, lnc were unable to reduce rin cell viability, but they still cooperated with pa in reducing rin cell number . this result implied that soluble mediators produced by activated immune cells cooperated with pa in inducing rin cell death. such an assumption was confirmed, as supernatants obtained from cultures of cona-stimulated rat spleen cells  also efficiently cooperated with pa in rin cell destruction . in order to eliminate the possibility that the observed effects of sn were mediated through direct action of cona upon rin cells, sn were treated with α-methyl-d-mannoside  with the aim of blocking cona activity. the blocker did not interfere with the effect of sn on rin cell viability , thus excluding the possibility of direct influence of cona on rin cells. importantly, sn and pa also cooperated in the reduction of pancreatic islets isolated from da rats , thus showing that the observed effect was not specific for the transformed insulinoma cell line, but that it had relevance for beta cells in general. finally, with the purpose of investigating if lower concentrations of pa and sn also cooperate in reduction of rin cell viability, rin cells were treated with  <dig> μm pa and 10% sn. as presented in fig 1f, individually pa and sn had just a limited inhibitory effect on rin cells  but their joint effect was pronounced . this suggested that pa and sn acted synergistically upon rin cells.

sn and pa induce apoptosis of rin cells
our next aim was to explore if the observed decrease in rin cell viability was a consequence of apoptosis induction. therefore, we analyzed annexinv-fitc and et-diii-stained rin cells cytofluorimetrically. while pa or sn obtained from da rat spleen cells applied alone did not induce significant apoptosis in rin cells after  <dig> hours of incubation, simultaneous application of pa and sn induced early apoptotic changes in more than 20% of the cells . importantly, the pro-apoptotic effect was also observed after just  <dig> hours of treatment , showing the rapidity of the influence. these results once again indicated that pa and sn cooperate in a synergistic fashion. moreover, increased activity of the pro-apoptotic cleaving enzyme caspase- <dig> was found in rin cells subjected to the simultaneous treatment with pa and sn . thus, we could conclude that concurrent application of pa and sn decreased rin cell viability through caspase- <dig> dependent induction of apoptosis.

t cell cytokines cooperate with pa in the reduction of rin cell viability
in order to investigate the nature of the component of sn responsible for the observed cooperation with pa, sn made from c57bl/ <dig> mouse spleen cells were tested for efficiency in cooperation with pa. importantly, sn obtained from c57bl/ <dig> mouse spleen cells were as efficient in the reduction of rin cell viability as sn obtained from rat cells, both individually and in cooperation with pa . moreover, similar efficiency was observed for sn obtained from cba and balb/c mice or ao rats . thus, we could conclude that the soluble factor involved in the cooperation with pa were not species or strain-specific. furthermore, we tested the resistance of the soluble component to heat by boiling sn for  <dig> min before use in the experiments. exposure of sn to heat led to loss of the cooperative cytotoxic action of sn and pa  indicating that heat-sensitive components were responsible for the cooperation with pa in rin cell death induction. the possibility that cytokines present in the sn were involved in this cooperation was investigated by treating rin cells with the combination of il-1β, ifn-γ, tnf-α, il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> in the absence or presence of pa. this combination of cytokines alone reduced rin cell number and also cooperated with pa in the reduction of rin cell viability . the effect was similar to that of sn, so we could conclude that cytokines might be responsible for the cooperative reduction of rin cell viability by sn and pa. finally, since sn were products of mixed populations of cells, including t cells, macrophages, b cells and other cell types, lnc were separated into cd3+ cells  and cd3- cells , by magnetic bead purification, and the obtained populations were used for production of sn, in order to determine their relative contribution to the observed cooperation. importantly, sn obtained from cd3+ cells stimulated with anti-cd <dig> and anti-cd <dig> antibodies cooperated with pa in the reduction of rin cell viability . on the other hand, sn obtained from cd3- cells stimulated with lps did not cooperate with pa in rin cell destruction. hence, we could conclude that t cells were producers of the cytokines responsible for the cooperation with pa.

pa+sn-induced rin cell death is dependent on p <dig> mapk activation
our further goal was to determine if p <dig> mapk-signaling is involved in pa+sn-induced apoptosis in rin cells. as the first step, sb <dig>  a selective p <dig> mapk inhibitor, was applied to rin cultures treated with the combination of pa and sn, and this inhibitor was shown to prevent pa+sn-triggered apoptosis in rin cells . accordingly, pa+sn-induced p <dig> mapk activation was detected in rin cells , thus supporting the importance of p <dig> induction for pa+sn induced apoptosis in rin cells. however, pa, but not sn, was able to activate p <dig> to the levels observed in cultures treated with both pa and sn. thus, it seems that p <dig> activation is not enough for efficient initiation of rin cell apoptosis, but that it is necessary for induction of the death of these cells by coordinate action of pa and sn.

hemoglobin protects rin cells from pa+sn-induced apoptosis
we also explored if the effect of pa and sn on rin cell viability was indirect, through induction of nitric oxide  production in these cells. inducible nitric oxide synthase  expression measured by cell-based elisa showed that pa+sn induced expression of this protein in rin cells, after  <dig> and  <dig> hours of incubation . additionally, the treatment led to no production in rin cells, while hemoglobin, a no quencher, down-regulated the levels of free no  and accordingly protected rin cells from apoptotic cell death induced by pa and sn . importantly, the p <dig> signaling inhibitor – sb <dig> that protected rin cells from the cytotoxicity also inhibited no release in rin cells . thus, these results clearly suggest that no produced in rin cells in a p38-dependent manner contributes to pa+sn-induced rin cell apoptosis in a major way.

discussion
in the present paper we show that cytokines produced by t cells cooperate with a saturated free fatty acid in the induction of beta cell apoptosis. the observed cooperation is synergistic both at the level of the intensity and the speed of the action. importantly, the cooperative effect was also observed if primary pancreatic islets were used as the target population, thus excluding the possibility that the cytotoxicity was specific for the transformed cell line.

there is an increasing number of reports indicating the importance of saturated fatty acids or soluble products of immune cells, including cytokines and no in the reduction of beta cell mass during diabetes pathogenesis  <cit> . nevertheless this is the first report to our knowledge, that describes cooperation between a saturated fatty acid and soluble immune mediators in the destruction of pancreatic beta cells. the fact that soluble mediators cooperate with pa is clearly shown in the experiments where rin cells and lnc were separated with tissue-culture inserts, and substantiated with the corresponding results obtained with cell-free sn. moreover, similar efficiency of sn from various strains of rats and mice, clearly suggests that product responsible for the observed cooperation are not species- or strain-specific. furthermore, the inability of heat-treated sn to cooperate with pa in rin cell destruction implies that the soluble product are heat-sensitive, i.e. proteins. the obvious protein candidates are cytokines, as il-1β, il- <dig>  ifn-γ and tnf-α have been shown to be efficient in β-cell destruction  <cit> . additionally, we previously reported that il- <dig> contributes to no-dependent cytotoxicity of beta cells  <cit> . moreover, one of the major constituents of sn – il- <dig> was found to cooperate with pa in the activation of jak- <dig> and stat- <dig> in human lymphocytes  <cit> . therefore, we used the combination of il-1β, il- <dig>  ifn-γ, tnf-α, il- <dig> and il- <dig> and were able to mimic the effects of sn on rin cells. finally, the observed ability of sn obtained from pure cd3+, but not cd3- cells, to cooperate with pa in reducing rin cell viability indicates that t cells are the major cell population responsible for the production of the soluble product which cooperate with pa in the process. importantly, the cytokines we used to mimic the effect of sn are either typical t-cell products  or they can be produced by various cells including t cells . this is in agreement with the observed ability of pure cd3+ cell culture supernatants to affect rin cell viability. also, if we take into account that some cytokines  can be produced by b cells, macrophages and other cd3- cells, and that production of all of the cytokines by t cells could be supported by cd3- cells, it becomes clear why cd3+ cells produced a "weaker" supernatant than lymph node cells. moreover the inability of cd3- cells to provide a supernatant effective against rin cells, leaves us with t lymphocytes as the prime suspects for the cooperation with fatty acids in the destruction of beta cells in diabetes.

furthermore, we can conclude that the major signaling pathway responsible for the induction of apoptosis in rin cells under the coordinated influence of pa and sn is the p <dig> mapk pathway. this conclusion is based on the p38-activation observed under the influence of pa and sn, as well as on the complete protection of rin cells from the apoptosis induction by the specific p <dig> signaling inhibitor. it is well known that p <dig> is involved in induction of apoptosis  <cit> , and more specifically in the induction of apoptosis of beta cells, under the influence of both cytokines  <cit>  and pa  <cit> . in our hands pa, but not sn, was able to activate p <dig> in rin cells. however, although pa potently induced p <dig> in rin cells, it did not cause massive apoptosis. importantly, with the same level of p <dig> activation under the cooperative action of pa and sn, a substantial proportion of rin cells underwent apoptotic changes, while inhibition of the p <dig> signaling pathway prevented the induction of apoptosis in rin cells. thus, it seems that activation of p <dig> per se is not enough for apoptosis induction in rin cells, but at the same time p <dig> activation is probably necessary for the observed cooperative induction of apoptosis in these cells.

finally, the major effector molecule responsible for rin cell apoptosis may be no. namely, the no scavenger hb protects rin cells from the deleterious effect of pa and sn, while the p <dig> signaling inhibitor, which inhibits pa+sn-imposed apoptosis of rin cells, also prevents pa+sn-induced no synthesis in these cells. the importance of no for induction of beta cell apoptosis by cytokines has been repeatedly reported, while the role of no in fatty acid induced death of beta cells is still controversial. for instance, it was shown that il- <dig> or tnf-α induced cell death in ins- <dig> cells and that il- <dig>  but not palmitate or oleate potently induced inos gene expression and no generation in these cells  <cit> . there are, however, findings indicating the ability of primary beta cells to produce no and express both constitutive and inducible isoforms of nos under the influence of pa  <cit> . in our experiments, massive production of no was observed in rin cells under the coordinated action of pa and sn. the novelty of our finding is that pa could contribute to no induction in the inflammatory milieu, represented in our experiments by sn. generally, it is thought that no-dependent destruction of beta cells is characteristic of t1d, where immune cells infiltrate pancreatic islets and produce no-inducing cytokines, while on the contrary fatty acids do not provoke no-dependent cell death in t2d  <cit> . here, we show that pa is able to cooperate with sn in inducing no synthesis. thus, it seems reasonable to assume that free fatty acid levels could be very important for the destruction of beta cells during ongoing inflammation in the pancreas. such a reasoning favors hypotheses that inflammation is important for the development of t2d, as well as that obesity is a predisposing factor for t1d  <cit> .

taken together, as it was shown that both no and p- <dig> signaling contribute to apoptosis induction in rin cells under the influence of pa and sn in a major way, it is tempting to speculate that in our system the cooperative effect of pa and sn is dependent on activation of p <dig>  which in turn leads to generation of no and destruction of rin cells. once no is generated, p <dig> might play an important role in the predisposition of rin cells to no-imposed apoptosis, as genetic down-regulation of p38α was previously shown to lower the sensitivity of beta cells to cell death induced by a no donor  <cit> . importantly, besides its role in classical induction of apoptosis, p <dig> activity has been assigned a major role in endoplasmatic reticulum  stress-induced apoptosis  <cit> . also, no produced in beta cells under the influence of cytokines has been shown to contribute largely to the induction of er-stress in beta cells  <cit> . thus, the possibility of the involvement of the er stress components in the observed effect of pa and cytokines on beta cells should be investigated in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
our results imply that limited hyperlipidemia and inflammation, when acting in concert, may carry out a powerful attack upon pancreatic beta cells. the cooperative cytotoxic effect of palmitate and soluble t cell products described herein has clear significance for understanding the pathogenesis of diabetes, as it suggests that there might be direct cooperation between factors of obesity and inflammation in beta cell destruction. however, as our data are from a simplified in vitro experimental system, it requires future in vivo/ex vivo studies to provide insights about the feasibility of the observed cooperation in living organisms.
