BACKGROUND
polyadenylation is an essential process in which a poly tail is added to the cleaved 3’-end of pre-mrna  <cit> . the 3’ untranslated region , via its embedded regulatory elements such as microrna targets, plays an important role in mrna post-transcriptional regulations  <cit> . accurate determination of poly sites helps to define the 3’-ends of genes, which is important for genome annotation and gene function studies. if a gene possesses more than one poly site, it is subject to alternative polyadenylation . recent genomic studies have uncovered widespread occurrences of apa which can generate tremendous transcript diversity  <cit> . majority of apa events occur within 3’-most exons, resulting in 3’-utr shortening or lengthening and generate transcripts with different lengths  <cit> . it has been observed that global 3’-utr shortening by apa can activate oncogenes in cancer cells  <cit> , whereas 3’-utr lengthening can occur during mouse embryonic development and differentiation  <cit> . the average size of arabidopsis thaliana 3’-utrs in the latest tair <dig> annotation is 217 nt; the apa extension in the literature ranges from 25 % to 70 % . how far are these estimates from reality? several recent studies have uncovered widespread occurrences of apa sites in plants and algae, such as rice, arabidopsis and chlamydomonas reinhardtii . however, the study on the genome-wide evaluation of 3’-utr extension in plants is scarce.

whole genome tiling array and transcriptome sequencing studies have revealed the presence of unannotated genes in intergenic regions. 19–23 % of the arabidopsis intergenic region was found to be transcribed using whole genome tiling arrays . hanada et al. identified more than  <dig> small open reading frames with coding potential in the intergenic regions of the arabidopsis genome  <cit> . comparative analyses of three brassicaceae species and six crucifer genomes have revealed approximately  <dig>  conserved noncoding sequences that show evidence of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation  <cit> . rose et al. predicted  <dig> novel multi-exon transcripts from human intergenic regions which were considered to be conserved during evolution  <cit> . longsage tags of  <dig>  from humans were found to be located in intergenic regions, many of which were generated from uncharacterized genes  <cit> . in addition, several recent genomic studies also emphasized the existence of 3’-utr extensions in intergenic regions downstream of annotated genes. lopez et al. used human ests  and observed a significant incidence of poly sites lying in the 5–10 kb region past the stop codon and found as many as  <dig> human genes with unreported 3’ extensions  <cit> . several long transcripts spanning the whole poly-poly or stop-poly distance were experimentally validated using a long-distance rt-pcr strategy  <cit> . using comparative genomics and transcriptomics across vertebrates, morgan et al.  <cit>  found many conserved unannotated 3’ ends and reported several hundred novel 3’-utr extensions. using deep rna-seq data, miura et al.  <cit>  found substantially distal novel 3’-utrs generated by apa in human and mouse. thousands of genes extend at least 500 nt past the most distal 3’ termini; some of these genes bear exceptionally long 3’-utrs . a dataset of bovine skin containing a total of  <dig>  unannotated transcripts was discovered,  <dig> of them were located within a 1 kb distance to a nearby genes and only four potential protein coding transcripts were detected in intergenic regions  <cit> .

only limited studies laid emphasis on the intergenic regions and the 3’-utr extensions in plants. moghe et al.  <cit>  found  <dig> intergenic transcribed fragments  in arabidopsis, ~30 % of which are likely associated with annotated genes. many of these itfs may be background or noisy transcripts, whereas only  <dig> itfs are likely originated from novel genes and  <dig> itfs are with translation evidence. using data from direct rna sequencing , sherstnev et al.  <cit>  proposed the first 3’-utr annotation for  <dig> arabidopsis coding genes without annotated 3’-utrs in tair <dig> and re-annotated the 3’-utrs of  <dig>  arabidopsis genes. duc et al.  <cit>  used drs to study poly site choice in arabidopsis fpa mutants and identified  <dig> intergenic regions differentially expressed in fpa- <dig>  schurch et al.  <cit>  illustrated several examples of improved annotation of 3’-utrs in human, chicken, and arabidopsis by combination of drs, rna-seq and ests. till now, a large amount of poly sites were found to be in intergenic regions in arabidopsis  <cit> . these intergenic poly sites might be associated with 3’-utr extensions, novel genes, or antisense transcription  <cit> , whereas they remain poorly characterized. although many pioneering works have been done for the improvement of 3’-utr annotation in arabidopsis, no attempt has been made to evaluate intergenic poly sites systematically at the genome level in plants. accurate reconstruction of parent transcripts and annotation of novel genes from these intergenic poly sites remain challenging.

in this study, we set out to identify and evaluate a large number of intergenic poly sites from poly-tag sequencing to uncover thousands of previously unannotated 3’-utr extensions to known genes and frequent polyadenylated transcripts from potential novel genes in arabidopsis. characterization of these intergenic poly sites will provide insights into the mechanisms of alternative polyadenylation and antisense transcription in plants.

RESULTS
determination of intergenic poly sites
to characterize arabidopsis intergenic poly sites at a genome level, we used three wild type  datasets from paired-end sequencing in a previous study  <cit> . more than two million poly tags  could be mapped to arabidopsis tair <dig> genome, generating  <dig>  cleavage/poly sites. 3’-utrs in tiar <dig> genome annotation were extended by 50 nt to improve the “recovery” of pats that are in the vicinity of authentic 3’-utrs due to microheterogeneity. cleavage sites in the same gene that are located within 24 nt of each other were then grouped into poly site clusters  to eliminate the impact of microheterogeneity of nearby poly sites  <cit> . finally, more than  <dig>  pacs are defined by these highly confident pats, covering  <dig>  genes. more than half  of these pacs fall within 3’-utrs defined by over 90 % of all pats . about 7 % and 4 % of pacs map to protein coding regions and introns, respectively. only few pacs map to 5’-utrs. approximately 5 % of pacs fall within ambiguous regions of the annotated genome owing to alternative transcription or rna processing. about 30 % of pacs map to putative intergenic regions, defined by ~3 % of all pats. these intergenic pacs  are located between two annotated genes on the same dna strand and are retained for further analysis in this study. the number of ipacs according to the original tair <dig> annotation would have been larger if 3’-utrs were not extended by 50 nt. this 50 nt regions are intergenic according to the original annotation by tair <dig>  a total of  <dig> pacs from  <dig>  pats lie within the boundaries of tair <dig> transcripts . these pacs are denoted as 3’-utr pacs and thus are not included in the study of intergenic pacs.table  <dig> genomic distribution of pacs and pats

distribution of ipacs
to characterize the ipacs, we first calculated distances from each ipac to its 5’ sense gene, 3’ sense gene, 5’ antisense gene, and 3’ antisense gene, respectively . the median distance from ipacs to the upstream 5’ sense genes is only 122 nt even though 3’-utrs were already extended by 50 nt . this is much shorter than that to 3’ sense or antisense genes , indicating that ipacs tend to be closer to upstream 5’ sense genes. this is not surprising because there may be a promoter region before the next gene at the 3’-end of the ipac. what is surprising, however, is the average distance from ipacs to 5’ sense genes is 1629 nt , which indicates that distances from ipacs to 5’ sense genes are not distributed evenly.fig.  <dig> schema of distances from an ipac to its nearby genes. solid lines represent dna sequences; shaded arrows indicate genes and their transcription directions



the majority of ipacs are in the vicinity of the ends of upstream 5’ genes . ipacs also tend to be close to the starts of the downstream 3’ genes . this result indicates that ipacs are more likely to be distributed close to the neighboring genes especially the upstream 5’ gene and distribute sparely in the middle of the intergenic regions. since different intergenic regions are in different lengths, to compare the relative positions of ipacs, we normalized the distances from ipacs to the 5’ genes by the lengths of the intergenic regions, and the result is shown in additional file 1: figure s2c. the majority of ipacs  are located in the start  of intergenic regions .

for ipacs whose antisense parts are also intergenic, we calculated their distances to the neighboring antisense genes. these ipacs are not as close to the 5’ or 3’ antisense gene as the sense genes, though they are also close to neighboring genes . this result indicates that antisense genes have much less impact on ipacs. in other words, ipacs are much more likely to be originated from the sense genes rather than the antisense genes. interestingly, ipacs are more likely located near 3’ antisense genes, which is consistent with the observation that ipacs are closer to sense 5’ genes than 3’ genes. as shown in additional file 1: figure s2f, ~20 %  ipacs are located within the first 10 % of the intergenic regions, whereas another spike was also observed at the end of the intergenic regions, indicating that ipacs tend to be distributed near both the 5’ or 3’ antisense genes rather than the middle of intergenic regions.

to estimate background noise, we randomly selected  <dig>  nucleotide positions  sites; the same number as total ipacs) in intergenic regions. distances from these random positions to neighbouring sense and antisense genes were calculated as background distances. as shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  there is a background slope, which may be due to the finite length of intergenic regions in the genome. this background slope was also observed in a previous study  <cit> . because a randomly selected position cannot be located at an arbitrary long distance from the nearest gene, the distribution of random positions is slightly skewed toward shorter distances. this slope is greatly reduced after normalizing the distance by the length of the respective intergenic regions . the distribution of distance from ipacs to 5’ sense genes is significantly different from the background distribution . the distribution of distance from ipacs to 3’ antisense genes seems also very different from the background distribution . our results indicated that distributions of pacs are closer to the upstream or downstream sense genes.

classification of ipacs
based on the distributions of the distances from ipacs to nearby sense and antisense genes, we classified ipacs into three categories : se-ipac, ipac in the 3’-utr extension of its 5’ sense gene ; a-ipac, ipac that is located in another antisense gene ; so-ipac, ipac that is far from all nearby genes . we focused on these three main cases of ipacs, the rest of the ipacs which may be close to the promoter of the 5’ sense gene  or the 5’ and 3’ antisense gene  were not analyzed in this study due to insignificance in numbers.fig.  <dig> schema of different classes of ipacs. se-ipac, ipac in the 3’-utr extension of its 5’ sense gene ; a-ipac, ipac that is located in another antisense gene ; so-ipac, ipac that is far from all nearby genes 



to determine an appropriate distance for se-ipacs, we first calculated the number of ipacs and random background positions at increasing distance from the nearest annotated stop codon by intervals of 20 nt . the overall distributions of ipacs and background positions differ dramatically in the first  <dig> to  <dig> nts where the position at which ipacs disappearing over background becomes apparent. to identify this position more precisely, we computed the ratio of background positions to the total number of positions at a given distance as the false discovery rate . when the distance to the stop codon is 700 nt, the number of background positions within the 700 nt region is  <dig> ; the number of ipacs is  <dig>  it is apparent from fig. 3a that the distribution of ipacs becomes flatter at 700 nt past the stop codon. therefore, given a fdr <  <dig>  ,  <dig> ipacs are considered to be associated with events of 3’-utr extension. these ipacs are classified as se-ipac . this result suggests that se-ipacs may extend to 700 nt past the stop codon, which is considerably longer than the annotated 3’-utr size  <cit> . it should be noted that the curves in fig. 3a are shown in a log scale and the actual number of sites beyond 700 nt is very small relative to sites in the 0–700 nt range. in contrast, the extended 700 bp length in arabidopsis is dramatically lower than the corresponding value observed from vertebrates   <cit> , which probably due to the more compact genome of arabidopsis. for instance, the average size of human 3’-utrs is ~1000 nt  <cit> , while arabidopsis only has a mean 3’-utr size of 218 nt according to tair  <dig> annotation.fig.  <dig> distributions of distances from ipacs to neighboring sense and antisense genes using background distributions as baselines. distances from ipacs or background nucleotide positions to 5’ sense gene , 3’ sense genes , 5’ antisense genes , and 3’ antisense genes . the curves in  are shown on a log scale



there are  <dig> ipacs classified as antisense ipacs  which may be from the transcripts of the antisense genes  <cit> . to further remove possible internally primed artifacts from poly-tag sequencing,  <dig> poly sites with a/g rich in the downstream 20 nt were discarded. although some genuine poly sites might be removed from this step, we preferred a conserved estimation using the curated a-ipacs. additional analyses of these a-ipacs are carried out in the next section. excluding se-ipacs and a-ipacs, there are  <dig> ipacs located at 700 nt or more beyond the upstream stop codon. distances from these ipacs to their nearby genes were then calculated for further characterization. the distributions of distances from ipacs to 3’ sense genes or 5’ antisense genes resemble the background curves . in contrast, distribution of ipacs to 3’ antisense genes shows considerably different from the background . thus, for further characterization of this special group, these ipacs are defined as so-ipacs, excluding those close to their 3’ antisense genes or 3’ sense genes . the three classes of ipacs are listed in fig.  <dig>  the majority  of ipacs belong to the se-ipac group, suggesting that most ipacs may be associated with 3’-utr extension.fig.  <dig> statistics of three categories of ipacs



characteristics of different classes of ipacs
general sequence characteristics of ipacs
to gain further insight into ipacs of different classes, the relative base composition of the sequences surrounding ipacs was studied. such analyses have been thought to be an effective way to identify important sequence trends and probable poly signals  <cit> . results show that base compositions surrounding se-ipacs and so-ipacs are similar  but with less a/t difference in the nue  region of so-ipacs. this difference probably reflects distinct poly signals used in different classes of ipacs. particularly, the profile of se-ipacs is indistinguishable from that of 3’-utrs pacs  <cit> , reflecting that these se-ipacs are very probably associated with known 3’-utrs. these se-ipacs that possess the general poly signals may derive from genuine alternative polyadenylation, unannotated genes, or transposons  <cit> . in contrast, the profile of a-ipacs seems to be different . there is little preference for t across the whole profile, but there is an increased occurrence of a throughout the entire region. we further divided a-ipacs into four groups according to their antisense regions and found that a-ipacs with different antisense regions show distinct profiles . therefore, the different profile of a-ipacs from that of se-ipacs or so-ipacs probably because that a-ipacs are located in the antisense parts of annotated genes, sharing the same nucleotide base compositions as their complementary parts.fig.  <dig> position-by-position base composition of ipacs in different classes.  se-ipac;  so-ipac;  a-ipac



we then examined the frequency of the use of poly signal hexamers for different classes of ipacs. poly signal hexamers can be classified into three types: aataaa, 1 nt variants of aataaa , and no poly signal  . as demonstrated in many genetic assays, the most dominant poly signal for promoting polyadenylation in plants is aataaa. approximately 7 % and 34 % of se-ipacs and so-ipacs have aataaa and its variants, which resembles the observation from 3’-utr pacs. this reflects that se-ipacs and so-ipacs may share similar poly signals with 3’-utr pacs  <cit> . in contrast, a-ipacs are associated with weaker  signals than other groups of ipacs. there are only 3 % and 23 % of aataaa and 1 nt variants for a-ipacs, which are much lower than other classes. thus, the strength of poly signal of a-ipacs is different from other types of ipacs, suggesting distinct mechanisms in the use of these signals.

our next objective was to obtain a measure of the accuracy of these ipacs. such a measure would be useful in the selection of the most promising candidates for experimental validation of novel 3’-utrs or intergenic transcripts. we adopted the poly site prediction tool for arabidopsis called pass  <cit>  to predict ipacs. first, the sequence of upstream 300 nt and downstream 100 nt of each ipac was trimmed. given a sequence, the output of pass is a series of scores of each position of this sequence. the bigger a score is, the higher probability of this position being a real poly site. using the default parameters of pass, we calculated the scores for all ipacs. moreover, randomly selected  <dig> 3’-utr pacs and background positions were used as controls. the output scores for each position of the 400 nt sequences of each group were averaged. as can be seen from additional file 1: figure s <dig>  the score profiles of ipacs and 3’-utr pacs are highly distinguishable from that of background positions. we observed a local peak in the position of poly site  with a sharp decline around the 3’-utr pacs or ipacs, suggesting that these ipacs share similar sequence characteristics with 3’-utr pacs.

3’-extensions of gene space from se-ipacs
the majority of ipacs are in the case of se-ipac. a total of  <dig> genes have  <dig> se-ipacs in their extended 3’-utr regions. these genes play roles in functions like phosphorylation and cell recognition , which is suggestive of distinctive modes of actions and functions for se-ipacs.  <dig> se-ipacs were supported by rna-seq data, which were located within 200 nt of genes identified by tophat/cufflinks pipeline. of the  <dig> genes, there are  <dig> genes that do not have any 3’-utr pac but have se-ipacs in their extended downstream regions. there are  <dig> genes that have more than two pacs in their 3’-utrs, and  <dig> extended 3’-utr regions have more than two se-ipacs. a previous study  <cit>  discovered  <dig> coding genes with newly annotated 3’ utrs and  <dig> genes with 3’ utr elongation more than 50 nt ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of these genes also possess se-ipacs, reflecting the authenticity of the se-ipacs discovered in this study. these se-ipacs could be a valuable addition to the improvement of the arabidopsis genome annotation. considering these se-ipacs as additional 3’-utr pacs, there are up to  <dig>  pacs in the 3’-utrs covering  <dig>  genes. these se-ipacs supply poly sites for  <dig> genes that were without an annotated poly site in tair <dig> .

to assess the changes in 3’-utr lengths after recruiting se-ipacs as 3’-utr pacs, we calculated 3’-utr lengths using original 3’-utr pacs and the expanded ones. as shown in fig. 6a, the length of 3’-utr after extending is significantly longer than before extending . the median length of extended 3’-utrs is 188 nt, which is 19 nt longer than the original 3’-utr length . the difference of the mean length is even larger. the mean length of extended 3’-utrs is 217 nt, which is 34 nt longer than the original 3’-utr length .fig.  <dig> changes in 3’-utr lengths after including se-ipacs.  changes in 3’-utr lengths using all genes with pacs; median lengths are 188 nt and 169 nt.  change of median 3’-utr lengths in function of the number of pacs after extending. genes with one, two, and three pacs were selected to calculate the 3’-utr length of each individual pac. the histogram “3pacs” uses genes with  <dig> pacs and shows the median 3’-utr length of the first , second , and third pac , respectively. the dashed box denotes the 3’-utr length before extending. the solid box denotes the 3’-utr length after extending. numbers denote the 3’-utr lengths before and after extending



we next assessed the change of 3’-utr length as a function of the number of observed 3’-utr pacs . in genes with three pacs after extending, the average 3’-utr lengths of the first, second, and third pacs are  <dig>   <dig>  and 305 nt, respectively. it is suggested that multiple pacs on the 3’-utr are interspersed on average every  <dig> to 100 nt. these lengths after extending are 13 nt, 21 nt, and 54 nt longer than those before extending. for genes with two pacs, the 3’-utr lengths after extending are 15 nt and 35 nt longer than those before extending. for genes with single pac, the 3’-utr length after extending is 24 nt longer than that before extending. this result also suggests that the 3’-utr length of distal pacs tends to be lengthened to a larger extent than that of proximal ones.

potential novel transcripts from so-ipacs
there are  <dig> so-ipacs which are located far from nearby genes . these so-ipacs are probably from novel transcripts. compared to se-ipacs, there are a lot less so-ipacs, which may be due to that the genome annotation of arabidopsis is quite complete and there are not many novel genes to be discovered. to validate these so-ipacs, we employed five public rna-seq datasets . novel genes not annotated in tair <dig> genome annotation were discovered from these rna-seq datasets using the tophat/cufflinks pipeline  <cit> . total  <dig> so-ipacs were located within novel genes identified from rna-seq data. if a 200 nt margin is allowed for comparison,  <dig> so-ipacs were validated. how many uncharacterized genes may be originated from these so-ipacs? an upper boundary for the number of transcripts detected in our analyses would be the  <dig> identified so-ipacs from unannotated intergenic regions. this is likely to be an overestimate, as multiple pacs may be derived from the same gene because of alternative polyadenylation. an estimation that includes this possibility may be obtained by evaluating the relative distance of pacs within the annotated genes and considering clusters of nearby ipacs derived from the same gene. here we estimated a more likely number of potential novel genes. previous studies have shown that apa is widespread in various species , we first estimated the distance of two pacs within 3’-utr. only 3’-utr is used because the majority of pacs are in this region. the average length of 3’-utr region after extending is 935 nt. the average number of pacs in the extended 3’-utrs is  <dig> . therefore, the estimated average distance between two pacs in a gene is 431 nt. this distance is used to cluster so-ipacs to estimate the number of potential genes.  <dig> out of  <dig> so-ipacs are located within a distance of 2000 nt of their nearby genes based on tair  <dig> annotation. at this distance, it is unlikely that a complete gene is inserted between ipac and the upstream annotated gene, as arabidopsis protein coding genes are on average 2343 nt long and separated by 5086 nt according to tair <dig> annotation. even if exceptions are possible, we consider these ipacs to be pertaining to the nearest annotated genes, or false positives. this step removed some genuine orphan sense ipacs, but we preferred this conservative approach to focus on ipacs of high confidence. the remaining  <dig> ipacs located 2000 nt past their nearby genes were selected for further estimation of the potential novel genes. after clustering, there are  <dig> clusters, and the maximum number of so-ipacs within a cluster is  <dig>  next, we used ests or rna-seq data to verify these clusters. if the dominant ipac in a cluster is located within the 500 nt of a given est or within 200 nt of the novel genes discovered from rna-seq, then it is considered as a of a potential transcript. using this approach,  <dig> and  <dig> clusters can be verified by rna-seq data and ests, respectively. therefore, one would obtain  <dig> to  <dig> potential novel genes from these so-ipacs as a lower boundary. these clusters contain  <dig> to  <dig> ipacs; the maximum number of ipacs in a cluster is three.

what is the coding potential of the novel genes associated with so-ipacs? first we estimated the possible protein coding regions from these so-ipacs. the average length of 3’-utr from all pacs in 3’-utrs is 200 nt. we trimmed upstream 500 nt to 200 nt region from each so-ipac to estimate the coding potential. using the coding-potential calculator   <cit>  to calculate the coding potential of these 300 nt sequences,  <dig> so-ipacs were considered as coding. we also utilized  <dig> itfs from previous study  <cit>  to assess whether these so-ipacs are transcribed or not.  <dig>  so-ipacs are located within 100 nt of the itfs, suggesting the transcription possibility of these ipacs. however, the relatively low percentage of ipacs overlapping with itfs may be due to that most itfs are significantly shorter and expressed at significantly lower levels  <cit>  and thus cannot be detected by our sequencing data. together, these results indicate that a small fraction  of these so-ipacs may be associated with protein coding genes, reflecting that the majority of them may be resulted from noncoding transcripts. the previous study  <cit>  identified  <dig> snornas  that are located in intergenic regions defined in our study,  <dig> of them possess ipacs from this study, indicating that a small part of ipacs may be associated with non-coding rnas. next, we further used plant long non-coding rnas   <cit>  to search possible ncrnas that embed so-ipacs. total  <dig> so-ipacs could be mapped to  <dig> lncrnas. the majority of these lncrnas  possess only one so-ipac . 31 % of lncrnas have more than one so-ipac, whereas the apa extent in animals is up to 66 %  <cit> . the single nucleotide composition profile of these so-ipacs resembles that of all so-ipacs , indicating that no different sequence characteristics may be used by pacs in lncrna.fig.  <dig> so-ipacs associated with lncrnas.  statistics of lncrna genes with different number of so-ipacs;  single nucleotide compositions of so-pacs located in lncrnas



the previous study  <cit>  predicted more than  <dig>  open reading frames  encoding peptides in arabidopsis using a bioinformatics approach,  <dig> of which were supported by several kinds of annotation data such as tiling hybridization experiments. as small genes encoding peptides are often overlooked in genome annotations  <cit> , it raises the possibility that so-ipacs may be associated with genes with small size. to test this possibility, we scanned the upstream regions of so-ipacs for previously identified small orfs with predicted small signal peptides   <cit> . from the  <dig> so-ipacs,  <dig>  of them were located within 2000 nt downstream of small orfs . up to  <dig> so-ipacs can be associated with small orfs that validated by at least one of the following five evidences, including the tiling experiments, the massively parallel signature sequencing  dataset, the plant protein database, the orthologs in rice, and the single-linkage clustering.  <dig> so-ipacs are associated with small orfs that can be validated by at least two of the five evidences. as the poly site marks the end of a gene, the presence of a poly site might be considered as an evidence for the identification of small orfs or ssps.

a-ipacs may be associated with antisense transcription
there are 21 %  a-ipacs whose antisense strand is not intergenic . these ipacs may be originated from antisense transcripts.  <dig> ipacs were supported by rna-seq data, which were located within 200 nt of genes identified from rna-seq data. 18 % of a-ipacs  are in the 3’-utr region of its antisense gene. interestingly, 44 % of them are from cds, 15 % are from introns . majority of the antisense genes  of these a-ipacs are protein coding genes. these a-ipacs affect  <dig> protein coding genes as well as  <dig> genes that are not protein coding; the latter include genes that encode  <dig> transposable element genes,  <dig> ncrna,  <dig> pseudogenes,  <dig> mirna, and  <dig> rrna. some interesting trends are apparent in the gene ontology analysis of these antisense genes . these genes involve in functions like response to abiotic stimulus, associated with hormonal responses and growth regulations, suggesting important roles for those genes with a-ipacs.fig.  <dig> distribution of a-ipacs whose antisense is not intergenic



antisense transcription may affect gene expression in both negative and positive strands  <cit> . we then inspected the expression levels of the a-ipacs and their respective targets to provide possible mechanisms of gene expression regulation. the number of pats of the a-ipacs and the total number of pats of their target genes were used as expression level analysis. there is a relatively low but significant correlation between the expression levels of a-ipacs and their targets . this result indicates that antisense transcription may serve to regulate the expression of target genes.

intergenic poly sites in oxt <dig> mutant
to examine whether the characteristic of intergenic poly sites in other mutant is similar to that in wt, we studied the intergenic poly sites in a mutant  deficient in cpsf <dig>  expression  <cit> . using the same strategy of classification of ipacs in wt,  <dig> se-ipacs,  <dig> a-ipacs, and  <dig> so-ipacs were found in oxt <dig> mutant . as expected, majority of the ipacs are se-ipacs, while the number of a-ipacs in oxt <dig> mutant is much lower than that of wt . the relative base composition of the sequences surrounding se-ipacs is similar to that of so-ipacs , both of which are indistinguishable from that of 3’-utrs pacs in oxt <dig> mutant  <cit> . again, this result reflects that se-ipacs or so-ipacs are very likely associated with known 3’-utrs. in contrast, the profile of a-ipacs is slightly different from that of other ipacs , which is also observed in wt.

next, we examined whether there is a large-scale shift of ipac usage between oxt <dig> mutant and wt. up to  <dig>  from the  <dig>  ipacs in oxt <dig> mutant are located within 50 nt of ipacs in wt, indicating that about half of poly sites in intergenic regions are shared by both wt and oxt <dig> mutant. the percentage of common ipacs between oxt <dig> mutant and wt is lower than that of 3’-utr pacs   <cit>  while higher than that of cds or intron pacs , which may due to that ipacs could be originated from any genomic regions. in addition, there is a relative high and statistically significant correlation of the read counts of common ipacs between oxt <dig> mutant and wt , indicating that poly site usage of common ipacs are unlikely altered in oxt <dig> mutant. however, up to 54 % of ipacs in oxt <dig> mutant are not present in wt, reflecting that a number of ipacs are specific for either the wt or mutant. similar to the observation of ipacs, 3’-utr poly site choice in a large majority of arabidopsis genes is also altered in oxt <dig> mutant  <cit> .

based on a systematic investigation of  <dig>  poly sites in intergenic regions, the distribution and characteristics of these poly sites were revealed. such a whole genome level work extended the boundary of gene spaces by redefining the ends of transcription. except for cases of a-ipacs whose antisenses are not intergenic, profiles and distributions of these ipacs are similar to those of 3’-utr pacs, indicating that these ipacs share similar sequence charascteristics of general 3’-utr pacs. this result was found in both wt and oxt <dig> mutant. the majority of the ipacs  are in the case of se-ipac, which would extend  <dig> tair <dig> transcripts beyond their 3’-ends, with a mean extension of 134 nt. these thousands of confident ipacs add  <dig> alternative 3’-utrs to  <dig> gene models with annotated 3’-utrs and  <dig> new 3’-utrs to  <dig> gene models without any annotated 3’-utr. these 3’-utrs extended  <dig>  mb of unannotated sequences  into gene space, and the average 3’-utrs are 134 nt longer than the tair <dig> average of 217 nt.

se-ipacs that extend the 3’-ends of known genes may result from several distinct mechanisms. first, these pacs can be the results of read-through transcriptions or alternative cleavage and polyadenylation, when the long-range pac is located in the same 3’-exon as one or more other pacs. for example,  <dig>  from the  <dig> previously discovered intergenic read-throughs  <cit>  also possess the se-ipacs in this study. the second possible mechanism that may explain long-range pacs is alternative splicing, in which each alternative 3’-exons can possess its own pac  <cit> . we excluded pacs in introns or cds as much as possible in our analysis. however, since many splicing events may remain unreported, some long-range pacs may be originated from alternative splicing, especially the distal pacs  <cit> . the third possible mechanism is the presence of transcriptions that starts in the 3’-exons  <cit> . some of these distal ipacs could correspond to partial, forward-strand transcripts, for which no function has been reported yet. an additional mechanism may be that the putative antisense transcripts corresponding to the ipac of the associated sense transcript. for example, a se-ipac on chromosome  <dig> identified in this study is shared by at5g <dig> and at5g <dig>  which was also reported in a previous study  <cit> . the intergenic region  around this ipac was found to direct gus  expression in a mutually exclusive manner during arabidopsis growth and development.

our protocol identifies  <dig> so-ipacs corresponding to novel intergenic transcripts, or 9 % of the total ipacs. two questions may be asked for these so-ipacs. first, how many unannotated genes are actually present in the current genome? verified by ests and rna-seq data,  <dig> to  <dig> potential novel genes were estimated by clustering nearby so-ipacs.  <dig> so-ipacs are likely associated with protein coding transcripts. this is a relatively conserved estimation for the number of uncharacterized genes and protein coding genes in intergenic regions. this result is consistent with the extensive transcription observed in intergenic regions in a previous study where only four potential protein coding transcripts from more than  <dig>  unannotated transcripts were found  <cit> . as many uncharacterized transcripts are expressed at low levels or in a tissue-specific manner, it is not expected that our analyses can detect all ipacs associated with these transcripts. additional arabidopsis tissues will have to be evaluated by rna-seq or other experimental approaches to completely identify the compendium of transcripts that are encoded by the arabidopsis genome. the availability of more sequencing data from different tissues will further provide opportunities to extend such comprehensive expression analyses. second, what is the biologic function related to these so-ipacs? although it is possible that some of these so-ipacs could result from spurious transcription, a large number of novel transcripts identified in intergenic regions have been demonstrated to correspond to bona fide genes which are differentially expressed and spliced  <cit> . the largest part of so-ipac diversity in the genome may represent nonfunctional sites that result either from background transcription or polyadenylation  <cit> . previous studies found that intergenic transcripts accounted for more than half  of the predicted ncrnas  <cit>  and 66 % of long noncoding rna genes have multiple pacs  <cit> . additionally, noncoding sequences in arabidopsis have been shown to participate in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations  <cit> . some distal ncrnas in intergenic regions can be reinterpreted as 3’-utr extensions  <cit> . in this study, we found that 20 % so-ipacs are associated with possible transcribed units and 27 % so-ipacs are located in lncrnas. therefore, the majority of these so-ipacs may represent ncrnas or long-range 3’-utr extensions of upstream known genes. interestingly, 49 % of so-ipacs can be associated with predicted small orfs, with  <dig>  of them in the vicinity of small orfs which can be validated by at least two kinds of annotation data, indicating that some so-ipacs might be originated from genes encoding pepitides. plant genes with small size are difficult to be predicted and largely overlooked  <cit> , incorporation of so-ipacs provided in this study would benefit the identification of genes encoding pepitide, orfs or ssps.

the intergenic region defined in this study is the region between two genes on the same dna strand, but  <dig> ipacs we identified corresponding to antisense transcripts for genes on the reverse strands . these ipacs are of cases a-ipac. previous study in arabidopsis was suggestive of wide-spread antisense transcription and a large number of pacs that were derived from antisense transcripts  <cit> . a-ipacs that are close to an adjacent gene oriented in sense strand may yield potential read-through transcripts extending to the respective ipac  <cit> . a-ipacs that are far from any adjacent gene could not be associated with adjacent, convergently transcribed genes, which are remained to be investigated. only 18 % of a-ipacs lie in the 3’-utr region of its antisense gene, however the previous study  <cit>  found that gene pairs with 3’ overlaps were significantly overrepresented among the cis-nat-encoding  genes. this discrepancy may due to that some of the a-ipacs may be originated from misannotation of the associated genes which remain further investegation. these a-ipacs affect a large number of protein coding genes  and  <dig> other genes that are not protein coding, such as mirnas, transposable elements, trna, snorna, etc. the correlation of expression levels between a-ipacs and their targets raises the possibility that antisense transcription may be associated with elevated gene expression  <cit> . however, strong linear correlations between the expression levels of genes pairs were rare and gene pairs may undergo discontinuous transcription and not be simultaneously transcribed even in the same tissue  <cit> , additional works are needed to further investigate the expression of a-ipacs and their antisense targets in more tissues or conditions.

of the rest ipacs that are close to the 3’ or 5’-end of nearby antisense genes were not classified in this study, whereas they may be transcribed from the opposite strand with respect to the closest gene, which can play certain cis-regulatory roles in the regulation of neighbour genes  <cit> .  <dig> ipacs were found in the promoters of  <dig> 3’ sense genes. as changing 5’-utr boundaries can produce large changes in genes’ protein output  <cit> , these ipacs could be associated with the mechanism of alternative transcription start site selection, which may lead to large differences in translation activity. however, given that polyadenylation typically does not occur near promoters  <cit> , the nature of these ipacs remains further investegation. together, these unclassified ipacs may result from misannotation of the associated genes, extended read-through transcription, or as-yet unidentified transcripts.

in this study, it was observed that about half of ipacs in the oxt <dig> mutant are not present in wt, suggesting that a number of ipacs are used in sample/condition specific manner. another interesting question is then raised that how many ipacs would be conserved across the different plant species. in mammals, conservation of polyadenylation patterns has been studied extensively . for instance,  <dig> from  <dig>  poly sites were identified as conserved between human and mouse  <cit> . approximately 10 % of human poly sites were also detected in matched tissues in other four mammals  <cit> . in contrast, little is known about the conservation of poly sites across diverse plant species. a recent study of apa sites between arabidopsis and medicago  <cit>  revealed that  <dig> genes possessed conserved intronic poly sites while  <dig> genes possessed conserved poly sites in cds. however, due to the relatively incomplete annotation of the medicago genome and the limited source of poly sites in other plant species, it is still challenging to conduct site-by-site comparative study of the conservation of ipacs across different plant species. instead, here we employed highly conserved blocks from  <dig> angiosperm plant genomes  <cit>  to make a preliminary analysis of the conservation of ipacs.  <dig> to  <dig>  of the three classes of ipacs were located in the conserved regions . if a 50 nt margin was allowed for each conserved region, the number of conserved so-ipac, a-ipac, and se-ipac increased to  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively . more ipacs in class of a-ipac were located in conserved regions than other two classes, suggesting a significant difference of the extent of conservation among these three classes . nevertheless, further comparative study needs to be carried out in the future to explore the conservation pattern of ipacs in plants when more poly site data are available.

CONCLUSIONS
the investigation of genome-wide intergenic poly sites in this study provides further insight into the scope of plant transcriptomes. the detection of novel genes or alternative 3’-utrs provides opportunities for functional studies of utr-mediated gene regulation and the improvement of genome annotation. these neglected utr regions and novel genes increase apa extent and transcript diversity, which should be incorporated in the search of regulatory elements such as microrna targets. our analyses help to add a large population of 3’-ends, expanding current arabidopsis genome annotation. all together, these new annotations of 3’-utr and intergenic units greatly revise the scope of post-transcriptional regulatory networks in plants. still, genome annotation is a rather complex process, extensive manual curation will be needed to precisely annotate the whole genome.
