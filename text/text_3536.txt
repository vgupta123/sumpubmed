BACKGROUND
multiple displacement amplification   <cit>  is used to amplify plasmids  <cit> , and bacs  <cit> , and for whole genome amplification  <cit> , for dna from limiting samples  <cit> , directly from small biological specimens  <cit> , and from single bacterial cells for use in dna sequencing  <cit> . mda from single cells has enabled sequencing of novel microbial genomes, bypassing the need to develop culture methods  <cit> . the vast number of uncultured microbes in the environment are now amenable to sequencing using mda from cells isolated by dilution or flow cytometry  <cit> , micromanipulation methods  <cit>  or microcolony technology  <cit> .

one difficulty with mda is its tendency to generate chimeric dna rearrangements in the amplified dna. for example, chimeras were found during sequencing in cloned libraries generated from mda reactions  <cit> . the dna rearrangements complicate genome assembly. while the correct sequence can be resolved by sequencing to a sufficient depth, it would be an important improvement to reduce chimeras, particularly considering the complexity of completing genomes of novel organisms. a high throughput method for sequencing organisms from environmental samples would be facilitated by elimination of the sequence rearrangements. here, we have carried out an analysis of the chimeric sequences and the mechanism of their formation. the majority of chimeras were inverted sequences with an intervening deletion. the molecular mechanism that leads to the rearrangements was proven by sequencing  <dig> chimeric junctions generated by mda.

RESULTS
an mda reaction from a single e. coli cell was analyzed by the  <dig> life sciences pyrosequencing method  <cit> .  <dig> chimeras were found in the  <dig>  total uniquely mapped reads  of e. coli k <dig> sequence. the chimeras were formed by the joining of two sequences.  <dig> chimeras could be unambiguously mapped to two genomic sequences  and were included in the subsequent analysis of reaction mechanisms. in  <dig> chimeras  a sequence inversion had taken place . the second segment of the chimera was inverted from its original orientation in the genome. only  <dig>  of chimeras resulted from the joining of two segments in direct orientation . the order of the two segments could also be reversed during the dna rearrangement. that is, the first segment in the chimera  could be joined to a segment that had been either downstream  or upstream  in the genomic sequence.

the rearrangements can be readily explained as occurring when displaced 3'-termini are freed to prime on nearby displaced 5'-strands. mda occurs through a process where random hexamers prime multiple times on each template strand . the reaction proceeds through a strand displacement mechanism with the phi <dig> dna polymerase extending 3'-termini while concurrently displacing any downstream copies starting from their 5'-ends  <cit> . a branched dna molecule results having numerous single stranded 5'-ends. many of these are ultimately converted to double stranded dna by the random hexamer primers. however, single stranded intermediate forms will be present and multiple alternative secondary structures are predicted to be stable. by a simple branch migration reaction, 3'-termini can be displaced  and are available for mispriming events that would generate chimeras . branch migration is an energetically favorable mode of dna strand exchange  <cit>  with alternative forms predicted to occur in equilibrium.

the displaced 3'-terminus would be free to reanneal, preferentially at randomly occurring complementary segments on nearby 5'-strands . the outcome will be the joining of two sequences in inverted orientation with an intervening deletion of the form a'c . the finding that 85% of chimeras had this inverted form supports this as the likely mechanism. the chimeric junctions also reveal the site where the displaced 3'-end annealed to the second template and continued elongation. in the example , from one of the sequenced chimeric junctions, priming was initiated on the new template where the sequence cgcag-3' on the 3'-end had annealed to the sequence 5'-ctgcg-3' on the 5'-strand. in  <dig> % of cases, the 3'-ends initiated priming at complimentary sequences of ≥  <dig> bp on the new templates. these ranged up to  <dig> base pairs of complimentarity . the complimentarity occurred in  <dig> % and  <dig> % of cases for inverted and directly joined segments, respectively, when < <dig> kb apart, but only  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, when > <dig> kb apart. therefore, there was a significantly higher frequency of complimentary bases for the more proximal segments.  <dig> representative examples  are shown of the base pairs between the primer stand and new template at chimeric junctions .

for inversions, the data is also consistent with a predominantly intramolecular mechanism in which a 3'-end relocates to a new template contained in the same branched dna molecule . the two segments joined tended to be less than  <dig> kb apart  in the genome and would, therefore, frequently be contained in the same amplicon molecule. furthermore, the distribution for inversions of segments < <dig> kb apart also supports an intramolecular mechanism where the limiting factor is the frequency of encounters between the 3'-end and new template. the number of inverted chimeras fell off with distance between the two segments . if these segments were not contained in a single dna molecule, no correlation to proximity in the genome would be predicted. however, the 3'-end could anneal to other molecules with no constraint on the map distance between the segments. consistent with this, for segments > <dig> kb apart, the number of chimeras did not correlate to proximity  for either inverted  or direct  rearrangements. however, even when < <dig> kb apart, there was no apparent correlation to proximity for the few segments joined in direct orientation . this is possibly due to a somewhat different mechanism involving hyperbranched dna forms .

direct rearrangements result from the joining of two segments derived from the same genomic strand . these were infrequent  and had exactly the opposite pattern from inversions; less direct chimeras for segments < <dig> kb apart , and more for > <dig> kb . the model suggests, for the simplest branched amplicons , that a displaced 3'-end has few opportunities to reanneal at a new location on the same template strand which would be mostly double stranded. this should disfavor intramolecular rearrangements. annealing of the 3'-end could also occur on other dna molecules which would present potential templates in both orientations. as predicted, these intermolecular events occurred at about the same rate for direct and inverted rearrangements  since the two genomic strands are equally represented among different dna amplicon molecules. for these data, it can be calculated that inversions are favored over direct rearrangement in intramolecular reactions by about 26-fold  = 26).

the genomic order of the two segments was reversed  in the chimera about half of the time for all chimeric forms . negative values indicate that the upstream segment in the chimera had begun as the downstream segment in the genomic sequence. as predicted from the model for inversions, the displaced 3'-end could anneal to new templates that would be available either upstream or downstream . also as predicted, for segments > <dig> kb apart there should be no preference  for the order of segments since these are predominantly intermolecular mechanisms in which the 3'-end could anneal to any genomic location on the second molecule.

it was also possible to exclude two other potential mechanisms as playing a major role in chimera formation. it would be possible for the displaced 3'-end to form a hairpin structure and self-prime . it would also be possible for the 3-end to begin priming on the same 5' strand that it had been displacing . this kind of reaction, called template switching  <cit> , is known to occur in some dna replication reactions. while both of these mechanisms will result in inversions, the 3'-end can only extend on a new template that is upstream of it genomic sequence . neither the hairpin nor the template switching mechanism can result in the 3'-end annealing to a new genomic location that is downstream. in contrast, the 3'-end is free to anneal to displaced 5'-strands that are either upstream or downstream  with a predicted histogram  that is born out by the experimental data .

discussion
the mechanism of chimera formation by mda was revealed by sequencing a whole genome amplification from an e. coli cell. 85% of the  <dig> chimeras evaluated were inverted sequences. mda could produce these in a three step process; 1) initial extension of the random hexamer primers by strand displacement synthesis in which the phi <dig> dna polymerase displaces 5'-ends, 2) displacement of extended 3'-ends by branch migration, and 3) mispriming of the 3'-ends on the nearby displaced 5'-strands. the first steps of random primer extension  <cit>  and the displacement of 5'-ends  <cit>  have been well established. the dna polymerase could not displace the 3'-ends, however, these would be readily generated by a different mechanism involving branch migration. in mda, multiple complimentary strands are concurrently synthesized from a template and these will compete for reannealing back to that template . displacement of single stranded 3'-ends would be energetically favorable through a branch migration mechanism  <cit>  with a resulting equilibrium between competing secondary structures. displaced 3'-ends will be free to prime on new templates  most frequently on nearby 5'-ends. we prove this model by showing that 85% of chimeras  do indeed consist of an upstream sequence that has been extended on a second, nearby template of opposite polarity generating inversions . moreover, the chimeric junctions show that in  <dig> % of chimeras the upstream sequence had initiated priming on a short complimentary sequence in the new template . in the other  <dig> % of chimeras priming did apparently occur with only  <dig> or no base pairs of complimentarity. this is not precluded since 3'-ends annealed transiently, even with some mismatches, would be rapidly stabilized as the polymerase extends them.

83% of inversions were formed by the joining of sequences that were less than  <dig> kb apart  in the genome consistent with an intramolecular process. this is reasonably consistent with the  <dig> kb average length of mda products when denatured and resolved on an alkaline agarose denaturing gel  <cit> . these strands will be contained in larger branched and linear forms in the native state. nevertheless, segments far greater than  <dig> kb apart would be less likely to occur in the same amplicon molecules.

all of the observations support intramolecular formation of inversions with rarer interaction between different amplicon molecules creating some direct and inverted rearrangements: 1) inversions are favored for segments that are < <dig> kb apart and more likely to be contained together in the same amplicon molecule, 2) all chimeric forms are infrequent for segments > <dig> kb apart  since these would be intermolecular and diffusion limited, 3) inverted and direct rearrangements occur about equally for segments > <dig> kb apart because separate dna molecules will contain potential single stranded templates of either strand equally, 4) within  <dig> kb, proximity of segments is favored for inversions  agreeing with an entropic advantage that depends on containment of primer and template in one molecule, 5) direct rearrangements did not correlate to genomic proximity for segments < <dig> kb  or > <dig> kb apart  consistent with most being intermolecular processes, 6) simple branched amplicon molecules are predicted to contain displaced 3'-ends and an excess of displaced 5-strands of the polarity that would yield inversions , and 7) direct joining for segments < <dig> kb apart  is infrequent consistent with the lack of an obvious model for the reannealing of a 3'-end back to its own template at a new location. an intramolecular mechanism for direct rearrangements would be possible within a multiply branched dna molecule, referred to as hyperbranched  <cit> , where several rounds of replication had occurred. as newly synthesized strands serve, in turn, as templates for more synthesis and branching, displaced 5'-strands would be available in both polarities to serve as templates. however, this mechanism appears to have only generated a few chimeras.  <dig> of  <dig> chimeras  were directly joined segments that were < <dig> kb apart . this is more than predicted on a random basis / <dig>  ×  <dig> bp e. coli genome =  <dig> %), but there was no apparent correlation to genomic proximity within the  <dig> kb set . perhaps highly branched molecules could more easily bring together the distal strands within single amplicon molecules.

about one chimeric junction was found per  <dig> kb of mda generated dna in the  <dig> sequences. a similar rate of chimera formation was found with the sanger sequencing method using cloned libraries derived from mda reactions  <cit> .  <dig> % of clones  were chimeric giving a frequency of about one rearrangement per  <dig> kb of mda product. the authors hypothesized that single stranded dna played some role in chimera formation and found that s <dig> nuclease treatment of mda reactions, prior to use in cloning, dramatically reduced chimeras. our work confirms the role of single stranded dna as an intermediate in the pathway for chimera formation . it was also suggested that chimeras were somehow created by the library cloning process since they were not detected by pcr analysis in the original mda reactions. our data proves, in contrast, that the chimeras are created during the mda reaction. possibly the earlier work failed to detect chimeras in the mda reaction because any particular junction sequence would be rare. s <dig> nuclease treatment of mda amplicons should prove valuable for sequencing by the  <dig> method as well as from cloned dna libraries as it should cleave the single stranded region that connects the two segments of the chimera . this model also suggests why s <dig> nuclease does not eliminate all chimeras, leaving 6–8% of inserts still rearranged  <cit> . mda generated chimeras that are eventually converted to the completely double stranded form would persist.

over the past several years, mda has enabled new experimental strategies in many research fields  <cit> . it has the potential to transform the field of metagenomics by allowing sequencing directly from cells isolated from the environment. development of culture methods is no longer required in order to obtain sufficient dna for sequencing. while the fidelity of the phi <dig> dna polymerase is very high  <cit> , two notable alterations of the amplified dna must be taken into consideration, amplification bias and chimeric rearrangements. while mda is the least biased whole genome amplification method reported  <cit> , there is some uneven representation over the genomic template. bias was even greater when amplifying from single cells  <cit> . however, all genomic regions tested were represented, at least to some extent, and it was feasible to complete genomes simply by sequencing to a sufficient depth  <cit> . chimeric sequences can also be resolved with sufficient sequencing depth, but add to the difficulty of assembling and closing genomes.

understanding the mechanism of chimera formation should allow better optimization of mda reaction conditions. it should be helpful to disfavor the annealing that occurs where displaced 3'-ends prime on new templates. the history of pcr development demonstrates many approaches for inhibiting nonspecific priming including lowering mgcl <dig>  dntp or dna polymerase concentration, or increasing reaction temperature. single strand dna binding proteins recently introduced into mda protocols  <cit>  might also disfavor unwanted priming. shorter mda reaction times might also help depending on the dynamics of single stranded dna accumulation and mispriming events. s <dig> treatment might also be more efficient at early mda time points since chimeras are eventually converted to fully double-stranded dna. methods to reduce chimera formation are currently under investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
the formation of chimeras is an important limitation to the mda method. in the case of whole genome sequencing from single bacterial cells, it adds to the difficulty of the sequence assembly process. this is particularly important for novel organisms where the sequence had not been previously determined. identification of the mechanism for chimera formation is a critical step in solving this obstacle and suggests many potential modifications to mda that could reduce chimeras. the  <dig> sequencing approach used here will provide a rapid method to assess the utility of tested modifications.
