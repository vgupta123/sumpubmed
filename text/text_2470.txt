BACKGROUND
comparative genomics studies at the interspecies and intraspecies levels have revealed the dynamics of genome evolution and the plasticity of plant genomes. within monocotyledons, the grass species of the order poales have been extensively studied for their genome structure and evolution  <cit> , but little is known about monocotyledon plants outside this group. musa species are giant herbs from the order zingiberales of the monocotyledon group and comprise two important tropical crops, banana and plantain. two wild diploid asian musa species, m. acuminata colla  and m. balbisiana colla  are at the origin of most cultivated bananas. intraspecific hybridizations within m. acuminata and interspecific hybridizations with m. balbisiana have resulted in various combinations of the a and b genomes in different cultivars. a majority of these cultivars are triploids with a genome constitution of aaa , aab  and abb  <cit> . limited genetic variation in the most economically important banana cultivars, which are clonally propagated sterile polyploids, has resulted in a crop lacking resistance to some major fungal, bacterial and viral pathogens and to several pests.

wild m. balbisiana is native to south asia with a geographical distribution ranging from india to south china  <cit> . it grows in forest clearings and produces non-pulpy, non-edible bananas. plants of this species are immune to several diseases and pests such as fusarium wilt and black leaf streak disease and represent excellent sources of natural resistance  <cit> . the b genome is used in breeding programs for its traits of vigour, of cold resistance  <cit>  and could also be interesting for tolerance to pests and pathogens. recent studies involving m. balbisiana plants prospected in china have shown that significant genetic diversity exists in this species  <cit> . a better knowledge of the genome structure and diversity of m. balbisiana should help exploiting this resource to increase the genetic basis of cultivated bananas.

genomic resources have been recently developed to study the genome structure of musa species. the size of the haploid musa genome is estimated as varying between  <dig> to  <dig> mb  <cit> . bac  libraries for m. acuminata  <cit>  and m. balbisiana  <cit>  are available and analysis of bac end sequences from m. acuminata "calcutta 4" determined a gene density of one per  <dig>  kb, similar to that of rice  <cit> . further insight on the musa genome structure was recently provided by the sequencing and analysis of  <dig>  mb from  <dig> bac clones  <cit> . the  <dig> predicted genes revealed that zingiberales genes share gc content and distribution characteristics with eudicot and poaceae genomes. comparison with rice identified traces of microsynteny that were retained in several regions since the divergence of the poales and zingiberales at least  <dig> mya. comparisons of two genomic regions representing  <dig> kb from m. acuminata and m. balbisiana revealed a highly conserved genome structure, and indicated that these genomes diverged circa  <dig>  mya  <cit> . however, no data is yet available on musa intraspecies sequence diversity and divergence.

resistance  genes encode proteins that indirectly or directly detect specific pathogen avirulence genes products thus triggering a resistance response  <cit> . the largest class of r genes encodes proteins with a nucleotide binding domain and leucine-rich repeats  associated at the n-terminal to a toll/interleukin- <dig> receptor  homologous region or to a coiled-coil  motif. nb-lrr encoding genes have been widely studied in plant genomes  <cit> . most of them are organized in arrays of closely related genes resulting from tandem duplication events. nb-lrr gene clusters have been identified in several plant species, e.g. in lettuce  <cit> , potato  <cit> , rice  <cit> , wheat  <cit>  and common bean  <cit> . they can span from less than a hundred kb up to several megabases, as in the rgc <dig> locus in lettuce  <cit> . within clusters, sequence exchange through unequal crossing over or gene conversion leads to the formation of new chimeric genes. in addition, point mutations and diversifying selection result in the creation and maintenance of novel r gene variants. studies on the rpp <dig> cluster in arabidopsis, the r <dig> locus in potato and the rpg1-b locus in soybean have shown reduced colinearity and differences in nb-lrr gene numbers between haplotypes, likely due to unequal crossing over between paralogs  <cit> .

in banana species, around two hundred and fifty resistance gene analog  partial sequences have been amplified using primers from conserved motifs of nb-lrr genes  <cit> . recent work identified the partial marga <dig> sequence from the wild diploid m. acuminata calcutta  <dig>  <cit> . used as a hybridization probe, this sequence revealed the presence of a multigenic family across three musa genomes, including the wild diploid m. balbisiana. here, we have sequenced, annotated and compared m. balbisiana "pisang klutuk wulung"  bac clones showing high densities of this nb-lrr rga. these sequences corresponded to two haplotypes of m. balbisiana which allowed us to study intraspecific variation of this wild musa species at the molecular level. new musa repetitive elements have been identified, and the structure and evolution mechanism of a large cluster of nb-lrr genes identified in these sequences is revealed.

RESULTS
identification of two large clusters of the rga <dig> locus in m. balbisiana
the marga <dig> sequence, previously amplified from m. acuminata spp. burmannicoides calcutta  <dig>  was used to screen a m. balbisiana "pisang klutuk wulung"  bac library of  <dig> clones, representing approximately a nine-fold coverage of the genome  <cit> . twenty two positive bac clones were identified, fingerprinted and grouped into two contigs of  <dig> and  <dig> bacs, respectively . two bac clones  were selected for sequencing because they covered most of the first contig and contained all the marga <dig> hybridization signals. their sequences showed a  <dig> kb long identical overlap and were assembled into one contig of  <dig>  <dig> bp . based on similar criteria, bac clone mbp036b <dig> from the second contig was chosen for sequencing and yielded a  <dig>  <dig> bp sequence .

the specific features of each sequence are presented in table  <dig>  automatic and manually curated sequence annotation predicted  <dig> and  <dig> genes and pseudogenes, covering  <dig> % and  <dig> %  of the sequence on b <dig> and b <dig>  respectively. this corresponds to an overall gene density of one gene per  <dig>  kb, similar to the first estimates of gene density in musa  <cit>  although slightly less dense than the average of one gene per  <dig>  kb found by  <cit> . most of the predicted genes correspond to one large cluster of nb-lrr genes spread over 59% of each sequence in length. this indicates that we have identified two large rga clusters corresponding to the marga <dig> probe.

percentages of exons and ψexons, introns and ψintrons, te and ssr were computed according to the size of the nucleotide sequence. percentage of intergenic sequences represents the rest of the sequence. in these statistics, the five and four gag-polymerase -encoding genes of b <dig> and b <dig> respectively, were not taken into account. ψ, pseudogene; te, transposable element; ssr, simple sequence repeat; rga, resistance gene analog.

genetic mapping reveals two haplotypes of the rga <dig> locus in m. balbisiana pkw
the b <dig> and b <dig> sequences could either correspond to paralogous loci or to orthologous  regions. the dot plot alignment of the two sequences showed two different patterns: a highly colinear profile at both ends of the sequences and a repetitive and more disrupted pattern in the central part . the repetitive pattern corresponds to the rga cluster in both sequences. within this region, colinear relationships are disrupted, although sequence blocks do show colinearity. to test the hypothesis of allelism of the two rga <dig> loci, a perfect n microsatellite sequence, mmacir <dig>  located in the central region , was used as a marker for genetic mapping on an f <dig> population of  <dig> triploid hybrids derived from the interspecific cross between the m. acuminata autotetraploid cv. idn <dig>  and m. balbisiana pkw   <cit> . the two amplification products from the pkw parent had sizes corresponding to the mmacir <dig> sequences on b <dig> and b <dig>  while the progeny had either one or the other band but not both and showed a 1: <dig> mendelian segregation ratio  for this marker . this strict segregation of the mmacir <dig> alleles in pkw demonstrates that the b <dig> and b <dig> sequences are allelic and represent two haplotypes of the same genetic locus in m. balbisiana. fish analysis of metaphase chromosomes of m. balbisiana pkw, using either bac clone mbp036b <dig> or the rga <dig> gene alone as a hybridization probe showed two signals potentially corresponding to one chromosome pair, thus supporting this result .

conserved and divergent regions between the two rga <dig> haplotypes
to investigate the extent of sequence conservation and divergence, we analysed and compared the sequence structure of the two haplotypes. the b <dig> and b <dig> sequence overlap corresponds to  <dig> kb on b <dig> and  <dig> kb on b <dig> with two highly colinear regions flanking the rga cluster . the first colinear sequence stretch is  <dig>  kb long and contains  <dig> genes and four pseudogenes. it starts in the middle of a putative aspartate carbamoyltransferase gene which is complete on b <dig> and only partially covered in b <dig>  four of the predicted genes have a putative assigned function based on similarity with known proteins in the databases , six genes encode hypothetical proteins highly conserved with rice predicted proteins and only one gene encodes a hypothetical protein with no corresponding hit in the databases. the remaining three predicted coding sequences  correspond to fragments of genes. the only interruption in colinearity in this region consists of two indels in predicted introns of the chlorophyl synthase vte <dig> gene . in b <dig>  the vte <dig> gene has a  <dig>  kb ltr retrotransposon insertion in intron eight and a  <dig>  kb musa repetitive sequence in intron  <dig>  both of which are absent from b <dig>  the second highly colinear region located at the end of both sequences is  <dig>  kb long and contains two predicted genes coding for a mitochondrial transcription termination factor  domain-containing protein and a putative serine/threonine-protein kinase . in both colinear regions, the level of sequence identity between the two haplotypes is very high . syntenic relationships of b <dig> and b <dig> with the rice and sorghum complete genomes were investigated based on best hit  and phylogenetic relationships . a syntenic relationship was predicted within the rice chromosome  <dig> and its ortholog, the sorghum chromosome  <dig>  this relationship is based on five of the predicted genes and should be confirmed on a larger sequence scale when available. none of the syntenic regions of rice and sorghum contains rgas.

in between the b <dig> and b <dig> colinear regions, the rga cluster shows a size difference of approximately  <dig> kb between the two haplotypes. this is not due to a difference in retroelement insertions as their density is similar between haplotypes  but rather to a differential expansion of the rga family . this region also includes a c-terminal fragment of a dna-directed rna polymerase i largest subunit rpa <dig> gene and several mterf remnants and pseudogenes interspersed between rga <dig> genes. thus, sequence analysis of the two m. balbisiana haplotypes showed that they differ from each other by few relatively small indels corresponding to repetitive sequences and in the rga gene cluster by differential gene expansion.

repetitive elements in the rga <dig> region of m. balbisiana
repetitive sequences are major contributors to genome structure and evolution and are often responsible for intra- and interspecies sequence variation  <cit> . repetitive sequences identified here include transposable elements and simple sequence repeats  and represent an overall 10% of each sequence. transposable elements are mostly present within the rga clusters rather than in the flanking regions . four types of transposable elements , mooz  and re <dig>  table 2) have been detected using ab initio prediction and similarity based methods. re <dig>  mooz and re <dig> have a size ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb. they show sequence similarity to plant copia/ty type of retroelements and have high dna sequence identity to musa sequences available in databases . mooz and re <dig> have long terminal repeats  of a relatively small size  and partial or disrupted predicted cds. re <dig> is a remnant copia-like retroelement with a disrupted cds and no detectable ltrs. an additional repetitive element, clio, has a  <dig> bp size with ltrs of  <dig> bp and an internal domain with no apparent coding capacity similar to large retrotransposon derivatives . this element shows several hits to m. acuminata and m. balbisiana sequences  but not to sequences from other organisms, indicating a new banana specific repetitive element. target site duplications flanking retroelements insertions have only been found for four elements of the clio, mooz and re <dig> type and several ltr sequences were partially deleted . truncated clio and mooz elements  were identified and in addition to the elements described here, fragments of ltr retrotransposon coding sequences are also present on both haplotypes . this indicates that most of the retroelements have been subject to deletions and sequence rearrangements since their insertion.

ltr features  and target site duplication  were determined using ltr_finder followed by manual annotation. for complete elements with clearly identified tsd and with ltr length exceeding the empirical limit of  <dig> bp, divergence time was calculated based on the kimura- <dig> parameter distance between ltrs with a substitution rate of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> mutation per site per year. stars indicate te fragments. my, million years.

the position of most retroelements is conserved, with the exception of three of them which contribute to sequence variation between the b <dig> and b <dig> haplotypes. a copy of the clio lard element in the vte <dig> gene of b <dig> is responsible for the first indel polymorphism in the b <dig> and b <dig> colinear region and within the rga <dig> cluster, one mooz copy is only present on b <dig> and the re <dig> element is only inserted into the b <dig> rga08f- <dig> gene .

no class ii element  was identified, but other repeat types were present in this region. in intron  <dig> of the vte2- <dig> gene, an indel of  <dig>  kb consists of a sequence showing several hits only to musa bac clones. this sequence is then clearly a banana repeat, although no specific structure was identified. a particularly complex region, re <dig>  was found highly conserved on b <dig> and b <dig>  this  <dig> kb region is at-rich with 30% of gc compared to the average 40% gc content. it includes three tandem repetitions of  <dig> bp and a fragment of a copia-type polyprotein. fragments of the re <dig> region ranging from  <dig> bp up to  <dig> kb are found at several locations within the rga <dig> cluster  close to rga <dig> genes. on b <dig>  adjacent to re <dig>  three tandem repeats of  <dig> bp are also present.

in addition, ssrs  are very abundant, with  <dig> and  <dig> ssrs in b <dig> and b <dig> respectively. except for ssr loci that were assigned to rga coding sequences, and for which it is difficult to find the real ortholog, most of the ssrs are unambiguously found in both haplotypes with their flanking sequences. of these  <dig> common non-coding ssrs,  <dig> are heterozygous, with differences in repeat number varying from one to  <dig> repetitions.

a large rga <dig> gene family
the most divergent region between the b <dig> and b <dig> haplotypes corresponds to the rga <dig> cluster. a total of  <dig> rga sequences were identified, differing in number between haplotypes, with  <dig> present on b <dig> and  <dig> on b <dig> . sixteen are potentially complete genes and the remaining  <dig> are fragments, pseudogenes or remnants with frameshifts, in frame stop codons and in one case a re <dig> insertion . all the  <dig> genes belong to the same family as they share 81% of nucleic identity in average . they also share an average of 89% sequence identity with the marga <dig> probe from m. acuminata calcutta  <dig>  on both haplotypes, only one complete rga is predicted on the direct strand : it faces an rga pseudogene on the reverse strand in a tail-to-tail structure  with less than  <dig> bp between stop codons. other predicted nb-lrr genes on the direct strand are gene remnants  all showing the same tail-to-tail structure with another inverted rga remnant. this indicates a duplication of a region containing this structure followed by loss of sequence. all remaining rga <dig> genes are predicted on the reverse strand, indicating an expansion of the gene family on this dna strand. sequences immediately upstream and downstream the cds of most rga <dig> genes are highly conserved, suggesting recent duplication events.

the structural pattern of mterf genes present in the rga <dig> cluster is also complex. on both haplotypes, one complete copy of this gene with an identical structure of seven exons, is present in the region flanking the rga cluster . within the rga cluster, six mterf pseudogenes and gene remnants are also present, interspersed with rga <dig> sequences. this indicates common duplication events affecting these sequences and resulting in the complex sequence organisation observed here.

conserved allelic relationships between some rga <dig> homologs
we compared the sequences of the rga <dig> genes and found that except for one case, the highest levels of sequence identity observed were between rga pairs from the two haplotypes, thereby defining allelic relationships. the two pairs of rgas in tail-to tail orientation  show  <dig> to 99% dna sequence identity and are embedded in a highly conserved syntenic region between the two haplotypes. this region of  <dig> kb also comprises a highly conserved rpa <dig> c-terminal remnant and is flanked by two repetitive elements re <dig> and clio which are present on both haplotypes . two other gene pairs  together with gene remnants rga08q-1/rga08q- <dig> showed 99% sequence identity and therefore also correspond to allelic pairs. the highest level of sequence identity between pairs was always between genes from different haplotypes, with one exception: rga08i- <dig> and rga08i- <dig> showed 98% sequence identity to each other as well as to rga08d- <dig>  suggesting a recent duplication of this gene in the b <dig> haplotype. the pair rga08d- <dig> and rga08i- <dig> is present within a highly conserved region between haplotypes which comprises the mterf <dig> pseudogene and the rga08e-1/rga08e- <dig> pair . this sequence block is in a different position in b <dig> compared to b <dig>  due to sequence rearrangements within the rga <dig> cluster. finally, rga08f- <dig> and rga08s- <dig> share 95% identity in their cds but they are not in syntenic position and they also differ by the re <dig> ltr retroelement insertion in rga08f- <dig> which interrupts its coding sequence . no clear allelic relationships could be found for the remaining rgas which are therefore considered as paralogs.

two clades of rga <dig> genes are present at the rga <dig> locus
the rga <dig> genes encode predicted proteins with two coiled-coil predicted motifs  at the n-terminal followed by an nb-arc domain with all known conserved motifs  and a c-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain with  <dig> lrr repeats for the complete genes. no intron was predicted which is consistent with genome wide studies in arabidopsis, grapevine and poplar which indicate that cc-nb-lrr genes are generally encoded by a single exon  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis identified two clades of rga <dig> genes . the first comprises all rgas predicted on the direct strand of both haplotypes, namely the two complete genes of  <dig> bp  and three remnants of  <dig> to  <dig> bp covering the nb region . these remnants are more similar to each other than to the complete rga08g- <dig> and rga08g- <dig>  which indicates that at least two duplicated genes of this clade were originally present in this region. the second clade comprises all rgas predicted on the reverse dna strand. these genes have an average size of  <dig>  kb . three remnants of these genes covering the nb region have a size of  <dig> to  <dig> bp. a 70% level of dna sequence identity was observed between clade one and clade two genes and their overall structure is highly conserved . one major difference between the two clades is the presence of coding microsatellite sequences only in the lrr region of clade  <dig> rga <dig> genes. the first microsatellite  between lrr <dig> and lrr <dig> results in a polyserine tract which varies from three up to  <dig> amino acids. the second microsatellite is a compound nnn motive at the 3'end of group  <dig> rga genes. the gaa triplet show the largest size expansion  resulting in a predicted acidic coiled-coil domain  for genes showing a high number of repeats.

evolution of the rga <dig> cluster: intragenic and intergenic recombination
sequence exchange was previously shown to be a main mechanism of r gene evolution  <cit> . using the program rdp <dig>  which integrates several modules for detection of recombination and gene conversion events, we investigated the degree of sequence exchange between the rga <dig> homologs. a total of  <dig> events  were detected between rga <dig> genes. these sequence exchanges affected all rga <dig> genes except for the genes in tail-to-tail structure .

unequal recombination resulting in increase or decrease in rga numbers in one or the other haplotype also takes place in the rga <dig> cluster. one intragenic recombination event was detected by the rdp program based on conserved sequence blocks between rga08r and rga08x . manual inspection of the alignment of rga08r, rga08x and rga08w suggests that the actual structure of the rga08r remnant results from an unequal recombination event between rga08w and rga08x sequences likely resulting in the elimination of rga08x from b <dig>  other recombination events detected by rdp could not lead to clear reconstruction of structural changes affecting the rga <dig> cluster. we therefore manually examined colinearity breakpoints between haplotypes within the rga <dig> cluster. in addition to the mterf coding sequences present in the rga <dig> cluster, a  <dig> kb intergenic sequence present at  <dig> kb upstream the start codon of the complete mterf gene is duplicated and conserved  within the rga cluster at three and two additional locations on b <dig> and b <dig> respectively . two of these  <dig> kb long sequences are flanking the region carrying the rga08l up to rga08o genes on b <dig> . another copy is present between the rga08k and rga08p genes on b <dig>  sequence alignment of these regions identified a shift of sequence identity levels between b <dig> and b <dig> within this intergenic sequence . this suggests that the absence of the rga08l to rga08o region from the b <dig> halotype could be due to an intergenic unequal recombination event between duplicated non-coding sequences.

diversifying selection
sequence exchange is a major mechanism of rga evolution but its possible homogenizing effect is counteracted by diversifying selection acting on specific residues of cc-nb-lrr proteins  <cit> . we investigated the sites under positive selection in the cc-nb region and the lrr region of complete genes using the paml package  <cit> . two likelihood-ratio tests  indicated that sites were under diversifying selection for the cc-nb  and lrr data sets . the majority of positively selected sites  were located in lrrs  and  <dig> of them were solvent-exposed residues  which are predicted to be involved in effectors' recognition in r proteins.

expression of rga <dig> genes
six specific primer pairs were defined in divergent parts of 3'-untranslated regions to test whether the corresponding rga <dig> genes  are expressed in planta. all tested genes were found expressed in different tissues of m. balbisiana  indicating that several members of the rga <dig> cluster are expressed and are thus potentially functional.

divergence time of m. balbisiana haplotypes
to estimate the timing of evolution of the two m. balbisiana haplotypes, we calculated the extent of sequence divergence between the conserved colinear sequences on both sides of the rga cluster. in addition to indels, these sequences differ by single nucleotide polymorphisms with an overall nucleotide diversity of  <dig> %. twelve complete predicted allelic pairs have been used to calculate the ratio of synonymous mutation per synonymous site according to  <cit> . on the  <dig>  kb of coding sequences ,  <dig> synonymous mutations were detected giving a p-distance of  <dig> . this is lower than the value found between genes of m. acuminata and m. balbisiana  which diverged  <dig>  mya. using the substitution rate that was recently determined for banana coding sequences , a divergence time of almost  <dig> mya was obtained for m. balbisiana pkw haplotypes.

we have also calculated insertion times of complete retroelements with tsds and ltr sequences above  <dig> bp in length using the method of  <cit> . an evolution rate double than the one determined for coding sequences was used taking into account the more rapid evolution of noncoding sequences  <cit> . based on this, the clio element located into the vte2- <dig> gene has inserted  <dig>  mya . this value indicates recent activities of ltr retrotransposons in the m. balbisiana genome and is coherent with an insertion of clio into haplotype b <dig> rather than elimination from b <dig>  a second clio element in syntenic position in the two haplotypes has inserted in b <dig> around  <dig>  mya and thus possibly predates haplotype divergence. its insertion time could not be confirmed in b <dig> due to rearrangements. mooz elements located on the left side of the rga <dig> cluster are also in syntenic position but their structure is complex with an inversion and indels. however, the complete mooz element in b <dig> has inserted  <dig>  mya confirming presence of mooz in the ancestral haplotype.

discussion
sequence divergence of m. balbisiana haplotypes
despite the increasing number of genomic resources developed for musa species, no study has addressed the question of haplotype divergence at the sequence level. molecular marker analyses have uncovered a large diversity among m. acuminata subspecies and also to some extent in m. balbisiana  <cit> . musa wild species such as m. balbisiana are generally outcrossing even if inbreeding is not totally excluded, due to potential crosses between vegetative offspring. we have identified two sequence haplotypes in wild m. balbisiana pkw in the region of the rga <dig> cluster which allowed us to assess their degree of sequence divergence. the structure and divergence of sequence haplotypes have been studied in different plant species including grasses such as barley, wheat and maize and recently in poplar and sugarbeet. they revealed a mosaic structure of conserved and non-conserved sequences at orthologous or allelic regions  <cit> . the differences mostly affected the intergenic space and were based on repetitive element insertions and indels of various sizes likely due to unequal homologous recombination and illegitimate recombination events. in maize, intraspecific comparisons have additionally showed a difference in gene content between inbred lines  <cit> . here, two regions of contrasting features were identified: the divergent rga <dig> gene cluster and the highly conserved non-rga region. in the latter, the gene content was fully conserved and the intergenic regions were also highly conserved. the two relatively small indels correspond to  <dig> % of the colinear sequence indicating few rearrangements in the region flanking the rga <dig> cluster. in rice, indels account for 13% of genome divergence between the indica and japonica subspecies  <cit> , whereas in poplar, indel rate was found to vary from  <dig>  to  <dig> % of non aligning segments between four regions of poplar haplotypes  <cit> . in terms of nucleotide diversity, our values  are very similar to those in rice subspecies in overall substitution rate  and for genic regions   <cit>  and are lower than those observed in maize  or sugarbeet . haplotype divergence rates might vary from one region of the genome to the other as shown in poplar  <cit>  where sequence diversity varied from  <dig>  to 1% in  <dig> kb spread over four compared regions. we calculated the nucleotide divergence at a second m. balbisiana pkw locus  and found there a value of  <dig> % overall nucleotide divergence . thus, the degree of polymorphism observed between these two haplotypes of m. balbisiana is in the range of what was observed for intraspecies diversity in rice and in poplar but is lower than that found in maize and sugarbeet. this degree of polymorphism is compatible with the recent divergence time of 1my we calculated for these m. balbisiana haplotypes.

the role of repetitive elements
the repetitive fraction of plant genomes is highly variable and can constitute more than 50% of the genome landscape as in some grass species  <cit> . in musa, a proportion of 35% of repetitive sequences was estimated based on bac end sequences of m. acuminata calcutta  <dig>  <cit> . the sequences analysed here showed a relatively low repeat content of 10% in size. the proportion of identified retroelements in the overall rga <dig> region corresponds to the average of  <dig>  retrotransposons per  <dig> kb found in gene-rich musa bac clones  <cit>  although this value is possibly underestimated as many musa transposable elements are still unknown.

transposable elements identified here all belong to class i ltr retrotransposons. they showed an uneven distribution, with the majority present within the rga gene cluster. it is difficult to know, however, if this difference in repeat distribution is a cause or a consequence of the rga <dig> gene amplification process. estimation of insertion times of re2/clio and re3/mooz retroelements  indicates recent insertions after the divergence of the musa a and b genomes,  <dig>  my ago. the presence of older remnants of ltr retrotransposons and the fact that most elements identified here are disrupted in their sequences is consistent with mechanisms of deletion affecting repetitive elements as previously described in other genomes such as rice and arabidopsis  <cit> . the recent re2/clio insertion  contributed to haplotype divergence in the non-rga colinear region and reflects very recent activity of this retrotransposon family in musa. indel sequence variation between haplotypes was due to repetitive sequences and suggests a major role of repeats in the divergence of gene-rich regions of the musa genome.

sequences presented here are particularly rich in ssrs, when compared to available banana bac end sequences in which only one ssr was observed every  <dig> kb  <cit> . density of ssrs in this locus is much higher, with an average of one every  <dig>  kb. a strong bias exists within the rga cluster, with one ssr every  <dig>  kb compared to the flanking sequences with one ssr every  <dig>  kb. the high density of ssrs within the rga cluster is due, at least partly to the presence of coding microsatellites within rga <dig> genes.

rga <dig> cluster evolution in m. balbisiana: the impact of duplicated intergenic sequences
the rga <dig> cluster is a member of the large r gene clusters identified in plant genomes, with  <dig> and  <dig> cds of the same gene family in less than  <dig> kb on each haplotype. large r gene clusters have been identified in several species such as common bean  <cit> , at the tomato i <dig> locus  and in lettuce where the rgc <dig> gene family comprises  <dig> members within  <dig> mb  <cit> . within the rga <dig> cluster, drastic changes have disrupted colinearity between haplotypes. these include a difference in rga <dig> gene number, in repetitive elements and a reshuffling of whole sequence blocks carrying rga <dig> genes and fragments of mterf genes. such features are similar to what was previously described in other plants at r gene loci . one specific feature here is the high level of sequence conservation of both genic  and intergenic  sequences between clade  <dig> paralogs which suggests recent duplication events.

two clades of genes coexist on the rga <dig> cluster with one clade showing a particularly large expansion on one dna strand. the two types of rga <dig> genes likely originated from the same ancestral sequence and followed two different evolutionary paths. the actual structure of the cluster and the presence of remnants in tail-to-tail orientation suggest a possible model of evolution where a duplication of the ancestral rga <dig> sequence was followed by an inversion and a differential expansion on one dna strand. the structure in tail-to-tail orientation was also likely duplicated then partially deleted. it was frequently reported that repetitive elements are associated to r gene clusters  <cit>  and the presence of duplicated sequences such as the ltrs of ltr retrotransposons could provide templates for unequal recombination thus generating diversity at r gene clusters. despite the identification of several ltr retrotransposons, we could not find evidence for their involvement in unequal recombination events. this is likely due to the fact that the complete retroelements we identified are not highly duplicated within the cluster. one particular duplicated sequence, the re <dig> region contains remnants of a copia-like polyprotein. fragments of re <dig> have been found close to duplicated rga <dig> genes and although we could not demonstrate such events, it is not excluded that this particular low complexity region corresponds to an old repetitive sequence involved in the duplication process of the rga <dig> clade  <dig> genes. in addition to re <dig>  three types of sequences are found highly duplicated within the rga <dig> cluster: the rga <dig> genes, fragments of the mterf gene and intergenic non-coding sequences of varying sizes which were found conserved at different positions. we could show that sequence exchange occurred between rga <dig> sequences. in addition, we found strong indication that a duplicated non-coding sequence with no specific features was likely involved in an intergenic unequal recombination event resulting in a large difference in rga <dig> gene content between haplotypes. the rga <dig> gene family thus likely evolved by mechanisms involving intragenic and intergenic unequal recombination, resulting in a difference in size and rga <dig> gene content between haplotypes. in spite of this, allelic relationships have been retained for some of the rga <dig> genes.

a particular feature of the rga <dig> family is the differential expansion of coding microsatellites in the lrr region encoding a polyserine and a poly-glutamic acid motif. such a feature has been described for the rgc <dig> gene family in lettuce  <cit>  and the hero nematode resistance gene in tomato  <cit> . amongst hero paralogs, the functional gene showed the largest expansion of the microsatellite. currently the function of these motifs is unknown, although their presence in r genes and rgas across different species suggests a potential functional impact of such regions.

the rga <dig> genes show all typical modes of evolution of r gene clusters. several of them are expressed, encode potentially complete proteins, and positive selection has been identified on specific residues mostly in lrr repeats. such a large gene cluster with a likely recent expansion could encode functional resistance genes. unfortunately, no resistance phenotype has yet been mapped in musa species. markers derived from the different rga <dig> genes here identified could help in targeting a specific disease resistance trait in musa species.

CONCLUSIONS
the comparative analysis of the sequence structure of two recently diverged m. balbisiana haplotypes revealed an overall high level of sequence conservation of gene-rich regions but also identified recent activity of repetitive elements contributing to sequence divergence. in addition, our analysis of the sequence organisation of the rga <dig> locus in wild banana has shown that within one diploid genotype, considerable variation exists in the number, sequence organisation, sequence polymorphism and mode of evolution of rga genes. larger scale studies on different m. balbisiana genotypes are required to better apprehend the haplotype divergence and evolution in this species and help breeders in managing the integration of m. balbisiana in breeding programs. in addition, the whole genome sequence of m. acuminata  will soon become available which will allow further comparative studies of the different musa genomes.
