BACKGROUND
mitochondrial carriers , located at the inner membrane of mitochondria , are responsible for transporting a variety of metabolites between the cytosol and the mitochondria and influence the activities of the metabolic pathway direct  <cit> . the substrates transported by mcs, such as nucleotides, amino acids, cofactors, and h+, are involved in oxidative phosphorylation, gluconeogenesis, the synthesis and degradations of amino and fatty acids, the macromolecular synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids, sterol metabolism, and thermogenesis  <cit> . the mutations of the carriers are closely correlated with diseases, including amish microcephaly, cac deficiency, niccd/ctln <dig>  neonatal myoclonic epilepsy, sengers' syndrome, severe obesity, and type ii diabetes  <cit> .

the substrates transported by mcs vary widely in their structure and size from the smallest, h+, to the largest and most highly charged species, such as atp. by considering conservation of amino acids, distance and chemical constraints  <cit> , and by modelling family members  <cit>  on the known structure of the adp/atp carrier, recent research has identified a common substrate binding site located at approximately the midpoint of the membrane  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanism of substrate selectivity of mcs remains incompletely understood. it is not possible to obtain the concrete structures of all mitochondrial carrier family  members through crystallization  <cit> , and thus uncovering the mechanism of substrate selectivity of mcf direct is impossible solely by linear superposition.

a powerful source of functional innovation is gene duplication and loss  <cit> . some reports have suggested that many of gene duplication events occur during the earlier period of vertebrate evolution  <cit> , indicating that if gene duplications exist in mcf  <cit> , the substrate selectivity changes may be a form of functional innovation closely associated with metabolic evolution. here we investigate mcf, a gene family with common functional categories whose members do not have clearly defined functions, and subject it to the big experiment  <cit>  to explore the evolutionary trajectory of mcf. we further investigate the synchronization between molecular evolution and macroevolution to search for evolutionary rules of sequences corresponding to structures of mcf in order to determine the characteristics of structural changes. the molecular mechanism of change of substrate selectivity was then analyzed to identify the transport functions of mcs.

RESULTS
gene duplication of mcf is under strong purifying selection
according to the classification of the mcf secondary structure region , tr has the most conservative sequence with an identity of  <dig> %, while the average identities of loop <dig>  and ncloop <dig>   are only  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. on the one hand, the high evolutionary conservation in tr reflects a stable structure maintaining the basic function of the transport channel. on the other hand, this evolutionary conservation indicates that the relatively small changes  of tr sequences may have a large effect on the substrate transport of mcf.

based on phylogenetic trees constructed from tr sequences, orthologous subfamilies were identified from gene families along with the relative gene duplication events. fifteen gene duplication events were found in twelve gene families . for the gene family tested, the alternative model  was not a significantly better fit  than the null model . this result shows that there is no positive selection in the evolution of mcf. according to purifying selection , the smaller the dn /ds ratio is, the greater the number of eliminated substitutions and the greater the selective constraint  <cit> . therefore, strong purifying selection is characteristic of a high number of eliminated substitutions and a strong selective constraint, indicating that its dn/ds values must be very small. the cumulative distribution of the dn /ds of mcf  and the mean value of dn /ds  both show that strong purifying selection occurs in the evolution of mcf in metazoan. the strong purifying selection indicates that mcf maintains a relatively stable substrate transport and its evolution is characteristic of continuity during metazoan evolution.

the evolution of mcf keeps pace with metazoan evolution
the distribution of gene duplication events was found mainly 750- <dig> myr ago , meeting approximately the earlier stage of vertebrate evolution along with a large scale of events of gene duplication  <cit> . according to the trend of the cumulative distribution of age distribution , an explosion of gene duplication events occurred approximately  <dig> myr ago during the ediacarian and cambrian periods . this timing indicates that the functional evolution of mcf began at approximately the same time as metazoan evolution.

the correlation coefficient is  <dig>   with well congruence by comparing the divergence time of species from the local clock estimation with the divergence time inferred from the fossil and molecular data , indicating that the evolution of mcf keeps pace with metazoan evolution. the metabolic evolution of metazoans may be embodied in the functional evolution of mcf.

the significant rise of hydrophobic residues at helix-helix interfaces
the evolution of mcf was divided into three consecutive phases  based on the fact that the evolution of mcf occurs in parallel to metazoan evolution. statistics on the components of amino acids in different structural regions of mcf showed that the hydrophobic residues occupying a large proportion of tr had a significant rise from the invertebrate phase to the vertebrate phase . there was a significant rise in the hydrophobic residues in trdown  too, while no significant changes in trup was observed. thus, the region with a significant rise in hydrophobic residues was focused on trdown <dig> . there was no significant change in the proportion of charged residues and turn residues in tr. according to the method of deselecting species, three sequence pools were applied into the analysis of aacs. non-ver was clearly separated from ver-eco and ver-endo according to the cumulative distribution of the proportion of the hydrophobic residues in trdown <dig> , while trdown <dig> did not show a similar variation . this result further demonstrated that the number of hydrophobic residues was significantly increased in trdown <dig> during vertebrate evolution.

interestingly, trup <dig> showed a similar distribution  with trdown <dig>  indicating that the number of hydrophobic residues was increased in trup <dig> during vertebrate evolution too. although trdown <dig> and trup <dig> faced opposite directions , the spatial distributions in the structure of adp/atp carrier clearly showed that they were close to each other and formed three helix-helix interfaces . the conserved p and g  in tr <dig> could serve as the hinges between trup <dig> and trdown <dig>  and made the helices in trup <dig> tilt to the trdown <dig> sides . trdown <dig> participated in the formation of helix-helix interfaces with trdown <dig> as well as trup <dig> . however, trup <dig> had no similar properties according to its space distribution . so, trdown <dig> served as links between trup <dig> and trdown <dig> and played a vital role in the formation of helix-helix interfaces, indicating the potential functional significance of the increased hydrophobic residues in trdown <dig> 

the "tight" structure of tr during vertebrate evolution
according to the orientation of the three dimensional structure of the adp/atp carrier, trdown mainly consists of hydrophobic residues and some hydrophilic residues . the changes of the type and number of hydrophobic residues in trdown affected the connection among α-helices and further determined direct the degree of compactness of trdown since hydrophobic residues in trdown accounted for the connection among α-helices . these hydrophobic residues were distributed in approximately the vertical planes along the central axis from the cytosol to the matrix .

furthermore, the logo  <cit>  analysis based on all the sequences in the trdown of mcf showed not only the enrichment of the hydrophobic residues at the same site or contiguous site in trdown, but also the transformation of hydrophilic residues to hydrophobic residues in trdown <dig> at sites  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> during metazoan evolution . the hydrophobic effect was lost once the helices were inserted into hydrophobic bilayers as a driving force for the helix association of integral membrane proteins  <cit>  such as the mitochondrial inner membrane protein, mcf. the helix association then occurs through a combination of hydrogen-bonding, electrostatic, and van der waals interactions  <cit> . due to the enrichment of the hydrophobic residues in position  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> of trdown <dig>  and the enrichment of the hydrophobic residues in position  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> of trup <dig> , we postulated that the methyl groups of the side chain of the hydrophobic residues might interact with the methyl groups of the hydrophobic residues from the neighboring residues in trdown <dig> by van der waals interactions to maintain the helix-helix interactions. the experimental evidence showed that a <dig> of bovine mitochondrial oxoglutarate carrier potentially engaged in inter-helical interactions as well as other key residues in the odd-numbered transmembrane α-helices  <cit> . further, we found that a <dig> was located rightly at the trdown <dig> and evolved from s at the same site of invertebrate , which indirectly supported our hypothesis that the increase of hydrophobic residues would bring in more methyl groups, further strengthening the accumulated effect of the van der waals interaction among them and generating a more "tight" tr structure.

according to the calculation of packing values of the residues in membrane proteins  <cit> , trdown <dig> in vertebrates had a significantly higher packing value  than that of invertebrates . this result thus further indicates that vertebrates have a more "tight" tr structure of mcf than invertebrates.

enhancement of substrate selectivity
the salt network formed by the positive acids and negative acids  from three motif sequences xx) constituting the conical pit of mcf  is important for transporting substrates  <cit> . thus, the tandem concatenated sequences from three motifs were selected to serve as the indicators selecting the substrates. the logo analysis on the mark sequences of mcf as a whole in metazoans showed a high similarity , indicating that the types of substrates transported by mcf are not different. this is in agreement with the strong purifying selection  occurring in the evolution of mcf in metazoan.

a phylogenetic tree was constructed using mega <dig>   <cit>  based on tr sequences from  <dig> carriers in slc <dig> and their orthologous sequences in nine species  . as can be seen, its branches were labelled according to previous reports related to substrates transported by mcs  <cit> . the tree clearly showed three clusters that correspond to three categories of substrates, namely adp/atp, amino acid and cofactor, and h+. according to the e-value of each carrier obtained by blast in all the fungal genomes database, we calculated the average e-values of representative carriers for each cluster, showing that the adp/atp cluster was 10- <dig> , the amino acid and cofactor cluster was 10- <dig>  and the h+ cluster was 10- <dig> . the results showed that the adp/atp cluster was an older cluster, while the h+ cluster was relatively younger cluster. combined with the size of substrates transported by mcs  <cit> , we found that the size of substrates transported by members of mcs continuously diminished throughout the evolution .

proline served as the hinge between trdown <dig>  <cit>  and the label sequences of pxxx  <cit>  . the conserved p and g  in tr <dig>  could also serve as the hinges between trup <dig> and trdown <dig>  furthermore, these conserved p and g in the transmembrane α-helices  constituted the p-g level  <dig> located at approximately the midpoint of transmembrane region and the p-g level  <dig> located at approximately the bottom of transmembrane region  <cit> . the two p-g levels  <cit>  made the trdown relatively independent and less affected by the structural changes due to helix tilt during the substrate transport process. so, the increased hydrophobic residues at the specific helix-helix interfaces could enhance the compactness degree in trdown and strengthened the interaction between substrates and substrates contacting sites  <cit>  of the mcf, thus allowing the passing of the substrates with the given size, in agreement with the trend of continuously diminishing size of substrates .

discussion
mcf acts as the molecular fossil of metazoan
the rise of oxygen concentration appears to have precipitated a massive increase in metabolic complexity, culminating in the rise of metazoans around  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . feedback in the rise of oxygen concentrations has led to increasing metabolic complexity  <cit>  and shows the existence of the intrinsic molecular mechanism of continuously adapting to the rise of oxygen concentration. we found that many gene duplication events of mcf occurred during the early period of vertebrate evolution, especially during the ediacarian and cambrian periods . further, the molecular evolution of mcf keeps pace with macroevolution . mcf located in mitochondria has a direct effect on metabolic activity  <cit> , and thus this feedback mechanism may be embodied in the functional evolution of mcf. these data make the mcf act as the molecular fossil for exploring metabolic complexity in metazoan.

enhancement of substrates selectivity correlates to the rise of oxygen concentration
the enhancement of the substrate selectivity of mcf could partially explain the feedback mechanism evolved in metabolic evolution from the viewpoint of providing energy and reducing damage. from the view of providing energy, if mitochondria can be regarded as an energy-producing factory, its core department is the electron-transport chain. the enhancement of substrate selectivity of mcf allowed for more frequent communication between the mitochondrial matrix and the imm. in addition, this increase of substrate selectivity provided more energy materials to the energy-producing factory by promoting the operation efficiency of this transport machine. thus, the increase in the concentration of oxygen as the last electron receiver in the electron-transport chain  <cit>  would produce more abundant energy to satisfy physiological needs.

oxygen participates in the provision of energy for the evolution of life but also brings by-products, such as superoxide and peroxides  <cit> . the enhancement of substrate selectivity of mcf offers a possible way to reduce oxygen damage. it is the tendency towards strengthening of the substrate selectivity of mcf that makes the enhancement of selectivity of the h+ substrate. uncoupling protein is generally considered as responsible for h+ conductance  <cit> . no specific uncoupling protein is responsible for the proton conductance of yeast mitochondrion  <cit> . the recent research represented that lamprey, generally considered as the most primitive vertebrate, had the uncoupling protein  transporting h+  <cit> , at least indicating the enhancement of selectivity of the h+ substrate. we also found the ucp subfamily was diverged approximately  <dig> million years ago , in good agreement with around  <dig> million years ago when the rise of oxygen concentration culminates in the rise of metazoans. this good correlation further indicate that the rise of oxygen concentration may induces the enhancement of selectivity of the h+ substrate, which reduces oxygen damage by affecting the imm potential, such as the role of the ucp located in the h+ cluster in reducing superoxide production and production of ros  <cit> .

in view of the important role of mcf as a molecular fossil in metabolism, we postulate that oxygen could be an environmental factor affecting the variation of substrate transport of mcf. our studies explore the functional mechanism of oxygen on the evolution of mcf from the viewpoint of the enhancement of substrate selectivity of mcf.

CONCLUSIONS
the more "tight" tr structure generated by the increase of the hydrophobic amino acids at specific helix-helix interfaces enhances the substrate selectivity of mcf, which reflects the evolutionary trajectory of mcf. because the goal of this study was to understand the variation in the structure of mcf from the level of sequence, our findings might provide the more specific mutation sites for laboratory experiments to improve experimental efficiency.
