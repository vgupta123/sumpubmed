BACKGROUND
the introduction of gene expression dna microarrays  about  <dig> years ago opened a whole new range of possibilities for studying genome dynamics by making possible the simultaneous analysis of the transcription of all the genes in a genome  <cit> . genes are represented in emas either by a reduced number of oligonucleotides  or by pcr-synthesized fragments spanning a fraction of their length. the advent of genomic tiling microarrays  expanded the possibilities of emas by increasing the number of probes so that complete genome coverage could be reached. tmas are widely used for structural and functional genome analyses, which include the localization of protein-dna interactions by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by microarray hybridization , the mapping of dna methylation and histone modifications, nucleosome positioning, dnase hypersensitive regions and the assessment of copy number variation, among other applications .

the generation of high-resolution transcription maps by hybridizing total rna to tmas has uncovered the existence of a large variety of rnas, many of which are non-coding, in a range of organisms that include bacillus subtilis  <cit> , saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> , schizosaccharomyces pombe  <cit> , caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> , drosophila  <cit> , human  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit> . this unprecedented view of the transcriptional landscape of the genome derives mainly from a qualitative interpretation of tma analysis, and raises the challenge of establishing the putative biological role of non-annotated transcriptionally active regions. a step towards assigning functions to these transcripts is their quantitative analysis to facilitate comparisons between different physiological conditions. in principle, the much higher density of the probes of tmas and the possibility of providing unbiased information about transcription directionality and antisense transcription should offer several advantages over emas for measuring differential gene expression. one disadvantage in the use of tmas for expression analyses, however, is the requirement of more sophisticated bioinformatic tools to process the hybridization signal from several million probes that have not been classified as genic or intergenic. in contrast, the number of probes in emas is at least one order of magnitude lower; they are unambiguously ascribed to specific genes, and the processing and summarization of their hybridization signal is relatively straightforward.

here we report a probe-filtering protocol to generate custom chip description files  to process the hybridization signals of tmas from each dna strand in a quantitative manner to measure differential transcriptional expression. cdfs can be generated from any genome annotation or any set of probes in a microarray and they allow direct use with the same tools as those used for the analysis of differential expression with emas. we experimentally compared the performance of the affymetrix tma and ema platforms hybridized with identical rna samples from the yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe to measure differential gene expression under conditions of oxidative stress. we also compared our results with those from a previous study using custom-made microarrays based on pcr amplified probes representing over  <dig> s. pombe genes  <cit> . our results show that tmas are as reliable as emas for measuring the differential expression of protein coding genes. in addition, by combining the high resolution of tmas with a labelling protocol that preserves the polarity of rna, we show that they allow the quantitative analysis of previously unidentified strand-specific non-annotated and sense/antisense transcripts.

methods
schizosaccharomyces pombe culture growth, oxidative stress conditions, and rna isolation
cultures of s. pombe wild-type strain  <dig> h- were grown under identical conditions to those described by chen et al.  <cit>  in  <dig> ml yeast extract  medium at 30°c and  <dig> rpm up to od <dig> =  <dig>  . two separate cultures developed from independent single colonies were processed in parallel throughout the entire experiment . cells from a  <dig> ml volume were collected by centrifugation at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> minutes and the pellet was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. hydrogen peroxide  was added to the rest of the culture at a final concentration of  <dig>  mm and incubation was allowed to proceed for  <dig> minutes, after which  <dig> ml of culture were processed as above.

total rna was prepared by resuspending the cell pellets in  <dig> μl extraction buffer ,  <dig> μl phenol/chloroform,  <dig> μl 10% sds,  <dig> μl glass beads . cells were mechanically disrupted in a fast-prep device  and the cell lysate was extracted with phenol, phenol/chloroform and chloroform/isoamyl alcohol before precipitation with  <dig>  m sodium acetate and ethanol. rna was resuspended in  <dig> μl of sterile water with diethyl pyrocarbonate  and was further purified with the rneasy mini kit  following the supplier's specifications.

target labelling and microarray hybridization
to hybridize the affymetrix genechip yeast genome  <dig>  expression microarrays ,  <dig> μg of total rna was used for cdna synthesis. target labelling was performed following the instructions of the affymetrix genechip whole transcript double-stranded target-labelling assay manual. to hybridize the affymetrix genechip s. pombe  <dig> fr tiling microarray ,  <dig> ng of total rna without rrna reduction was used for cdna synthesis. target labelling preserving the original polarity of rnas was performed following the instructions of the genechip whole transcript sense target labelling assay manual from affymetrix. biological duplicates from cells treated and not treated with  <dig>  mm hydrogen peroxide were used to hybridize tmas and emas. the pearson correlation coefficients of the probe hybridization signals between tma duplicates hybridized with rna from untreated and hydrogen peroxide-treated samples were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. in the case of emas, the pearson correlation coefficients were  <dig>  and  <dig> , indicating minimum variability between duplicates. the complete set of microarray hybridization results is available at the geo database under accession number gse <dig> 

differential expression analyses
for differential expression analyses, microarray probe intensities were processed using the robust multiarray average  procedure, which includes rma background adjustment, quantile normalization, and median polish summarization  <cit> .

segmentation algorithm for non-annotated differentially transcribed regions 
the segmentation algorithm used to define the boundaries of non-annotated differentially transcribed regions  included only probes displaying a difference in the hybridization signal above  <dig>  . probes less than  <dig> nucleotides apart  were clustered in a single region. only regions larger than  <dig> nucleotides with an average hybridization signal difference of all the probes included above  <dig>   were selected. regions meeting these criteria were fused if the distance between them was shorter than  <dig> nucleotides.

RESULTS
generation of custom chip description files  for expression analyses
analysis of differential gene expression using microarrays requires the generation of a chip description file , which links each position in the microarray to a specific gene. for the specific analyses addressed in this work, we generated several custom cdfs following the steps indicated in the flowchart shown in figure  <dig> 

in the first step, the sequences of probes in the affymetrix platforms are filtered so that no more that one probe with the same nucleotide sequence will be present in the cdf. in a second step, each single copy probe is mapped against the complete genome sequence used as a reference and those not matching are discarded . this process requires intensive computation since more than a million probes  must be mapped onto the  <dig>  mb of the s. pombe genome . this step was optimized using a karp-rabin algorithm  <cit> , adapted to a four-size alphabet. the marked decrease from  <dig> to  <dig> probes in the ema platform  was mostly due to the removal of probes against the saccharomyces cerevisiae genome included in the affymetrix genechip yeast genome  <dig>  expression microarrays. in a third stage, probes mapping to more than one position in the genome are also discarded. in the fourth step, each probe is mapped against the corresponding genome annotation to select only those matching exons or predicted open reading frames . as a reference, we used the sanger centre genome annotation release of july  <dig>   <dig>  which includes  <dig> genes. the fifth step integrates all remaining probes into probesets that represent the number of orfs in a given genome annotation. genes represented by less than four probes in tmas or emas were not incorporated into the final cdfs because this has been reported to be the lowest number of probes able to provide statistically significant results  <cit> . the cdf files generated can be used directly with current tools for the differential expression analysis of emas, such as the robust multichip analysis  method  <cit> .

following this scheme, we generated three custom cdfs :

 <dig>  cdf "sp_tma". this included probes from the affymetrix genechip s. pombe  <dig> fr tiling array filtered as described above to generate  <dig> probesets.

 <dig>  cdf "sp_ema". this included probes from affymetrix genechip yeast genome  <dig>  filtered to generate  <dig> probesets. we used the same genome annotation as in the sp_tma cdf to make the results comparable between both platforms.

 <dig>  cdf "sp_pcr_tma". to compare results from both affymetrix platforms and custom designed microarrays developed in the sanger centre  <cit> , as a reference in step  <dig>  we used the sequence of the amplicons used as probes in the sanger microarray. as a result,  <dig> probesets were generated from the affymetrix tma  <dig> fr matching sequences in the sanger amplicons. we have called the original sanger custom microarray "sp_pcr_ema".

the perl software used and the custom cdfs generated for expression analysis can be downloaded from our web site http://genomics.usal.es/tmade.

probe density and number of genes analyzed using different platforms
as shown in table  <dig>  the total number of probes matching genes  is 6-fold higher in sp_tma than in sp_ema because the number of probes per gene is proportional to their size in sp_tma. this means that  <dig> % of all the genes are represented by  <dig> or more probes in sp_tma, while  <dig> % and  <dig> % are represented by  <dig> or  <dig> probes in sp_ema cdf, respectively . in addition, sp_tma allowed the analysis of  <dig> genes and  <dig> genes not present in sp_ema or sp_pcr_ema, respectively. because the amplicons in sp_pcr_ema range between 180- <dig> bp,  <dig> % of the genes are represented by  <dig> or more probes in sp_pcr_tma .

the differences in the probe coverage of specific genes in the different platforms are illustrated in figure  <dig>  orfs of average size, such as cdc <dig>  or taz <dig> , are represented by  <dig> and  <dig> probes, respectively, in sp_tma, and by  <dig> in both cases in sp_ema. only very small genes, such as spac11d <dig> c , would be represented by a lower number of probes in sp_tma than in sp_ema. this disadvantage would affect  <dig> annotated orfs shorter than  <dig> bp, which represent only  <dig> % of all s. pombe genes. figure  <dig> also shows the amplicons representing these four orfs in sp_pcr_ema and the corresponding probe coverage in sp_pcr_tma.

comparative analysis of differential gene expression
we undertook a comparative analysis of differential gene expression of s. pombe under conditions of oxidative stress using the tma and ema platforms. figure 4a shows that the pearson correlation coefficient between the levels of differential expression of the  <dig> genes detected by sp_ema and their corresponding counterparts in sp_tma is  <dig> , indicating the similar performance of both platforms. the coefficient, however, dropped to  <dig>  upon comparing sp_tma and sp_pcr_ema . this lower correlation could be due to the use of different microarray platforms and hybridization conditions  <cit>  or to the localization of probes relative to genes . to distinguish between these possibilities, we generated a sp_pcr_tma cdf as described above and compared the differential expression detected in both cases. the correlation coefficient rose to  <dig>  , which was even better than that seen in figure 4a, probably because the average number of probes per gene is higher in sp_pcr_tma than in sp_ema. this implies that differences between sp_tma and pcr-based sp_pcr_ema are likely due to the use of different platforms, labelling protocols, and processing of the results, as has also been reported in other comparative studies  <cit> . the numerical values of differential expression between the platforms on which the correlations in figure  <dig> were calculated are shown in additional file  <dig> 

taken together, these results show that the sp_tma and sp_ema affymetrix platforms yielded virtually identical results, thus validating the use of tmas for the analysis of differential expression of annotated genes. these results are consistent with those reported in a previous study carried out in arabidopsis, in which a strong correlation between the performance of emas and tmas for quantitative gene expression was also found  <cit> . the fact that the correlation between the results from both platforms was higher in our study could be due to a more precise annotation of the s. pombe genome relative to arabidopsis or to the fact that repetitive probes were not filtered out in that study.

quantitative analysis of dna strand-specific transcription and of non-annotated transcripts
the use of a labelling protocol that preserves the polarity of transcribed rna allowed the detection of differentially transcribed regions  from each dna strand . this experimental approach is so sensitive that it can measure differential expression even between sense and antisense transcription from the same genomic region, as in the case of the spbc21c <dig>  gene . two examples of antisense dtrs  are shown in figures 5c and 5d). one of the main advantages of tmas over emas is the possibility of identifying non-annotated dtrs. measurement of their differential expression requires the genomic coordinates of their boundaries to be established prior to the generation of custom cdfs. to this end, we used a segmentation algorithm based on the log <dig> ratio of the probe-by-probe differential hybridization signal after quantile normalization of the signal for each independent hybridization experiment. this strategy does not require previous generation of a transcriptome map since it selects only differentially expressed probes across the genome regardless of whether they map to previously identified orfs, and it excludes the large majority of genes and non-annotated transcripts whose expression is not affected under the experimental conditions tested. for segmentation, we used a sliding-window strategy coupled to a thresholding criterion  <cit> , as described in materials and methods. once the boundaries of the dtrs had been established, they were used as input to generate a custom cdf, following the strategy described in figure  <dig> for quantitative analysis. by using this approach, we detected  <dig> dtrs showing a higher than two-fold differential expression, of which  <dig>  did not overlap annotated orfs, such as dtr <dig> and dtr <dig> . the quantitative data for differentially expressed non-annotated dtrs across the entire s. pombe genome are shown in additional file  <dig> and can be visualized on the genome browser of our web site http://genomics.usal.es/tmade/browser.

the development of dna microarrays and more recently of deep sequencing technologies has revealed that in addition to protein coding genes, a large fraction of eukaryotic genomes are transcribed. detailed transcriptome maps in saccharomyces cerevisiae have uncovered an unexpectedly large amount of stable and unstable non-coding rnas, a large fraction of which are transcribed bidirectionally from nucleosome-free regions  <cit> . in order to assess the biological role of these trancripts, the approach described here should be useful to measure their differential expression under different physiological conditions. it could also be adapted to the analysis of the allele-specific expression that has been recently reported in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . the possibility of assigning polarity to non-annotated dtrs is essential for predicting possible rna secondary structures that could be relevant to their function. this is particularly well illustrated by the human harf <dig> non-coding transcript, which derives from one of the most divergent regions between humans and chimpanzees  <cit>  and is one out of several candidate genes that could contribute to establishing differences between both species.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that information derived from tma hybridization can be simultaneously processed for high-resolution qualitative and quantitative analysis of differentially transcribed regions. the consistency of the performance of tmas, their genome-wide coverage, and their adaptability to updated genome annotations, together with the possibility of quantitative measurement of the differential expression of non-annotated and antisense transcripts, makes them a tool of choice for the analysis of genome dynamics in any organism for which tma platforms are available.
