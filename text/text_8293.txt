BACKGROUND
the fauna of the world's oceans is dominated in terms of abundance and biomass by drifting organisms collectively referred to as plankton. plankton occur in all marine waters, throughout all depths, and, for many species, across widespread biogeographical regions. zooplankton  support many major fisheries and mediate fluxes of nutrients and chemical elements essential to life on earth. despite more than a century of sampling the oceans, a comprehensive understanding of zooplankton biodiversity has eluded oceanographers because of the fragile nature and small body size of these organisms, as well as the large number of species from various taxonomic phyla  <cit> . for many zooplankton groups, there are longstanding and unresolved questions of species identification, systematic relationships, genetic diversity, and biogeography. in light of this, we are working toward a taxonomically comprehensive assessment of zooplankton biodiversity throughout the world's oceans through the international project census of marine zooplankton  <cit> .

RESULTS
a zooplankton sample was collected off pohnpei island, micronesia . a cdna mitochondrial coi  gene library was constructed from the sample, and  <dig>  inserts containing the mitochondrial coi gene were randomly sequenced . a cdna rather than a gdna library was constructed to remove pseudogene sequences from the analysis  <cit> . the mismatch distribution of these  <dig>  sequences revealed a high frequency of very small  genetic distance sequence pairs . these sequence pairs with very small genetic distances were assumed to have originated from the same species . a second peak was observed around a distance of about  <dig>  , and most of these counts were comparisons between two phylogroups in the copepoda clade . the frequencies between these peaks were very low. the minimum frequency  was observed in the range between  <dig>  and  <dig> . based on this observation, we set the criterion that if the genetic distance of two sequences was greater than  <dig> , the sequences were derived from different species. if the genetic distance of two sequences was less than  <dig> , then we considered the sequences to be derived from the same species. the genetic distances of the mitochondrial coi gene sequence have been reported from various animal taxa , and the general ranges for the intra- and interspecies distances are  <dig> - <dig>  and  <dig> - <dig> , respectively   <cit> . although it is not a conclusive value for animal species definition, we have tentatively taken a genetic distance of  <dig>  as the boundary between intra- and interspecies distances in this study, and this value was in the range of interspecific genetic distance reported previously  <cit> . the rarefaction curve was estimated using the criterion of a genetic distance of  <dig>   using dotur  <cit> . although the number of observed otus is still growing in  <dig>  sequenced colonies, the rate of increase of the curve decreased gradually after around  <dig> sequenced colonies. figure  <dig> shows the relationships between species richness estimated by chao <dig>  rarefaction, and percentage of sequence differences used for the estimation. the figure shows gradual changes of chao <dig> and rarefaction around sequence differences of  <dig> . as the distance of  <dig>  is not a conclusive value for species definition, caution is required in the further use of this value.

we conducted blastn searches against the genbank non-redundant database using as queries all sequences derived from the analysis. among the sequences, those that fulfilled the criteria  were assigned to  <dig> taxonomic groups . several of the assigned sequences showed very high degrees of nucleotide similarity to known species, including copepoda , euphausiacea , mollusca , and vertebrata . the very high degrees of similarity indicated that these species were actually collected in our sampling. among them, one vertebrate species, coryphaena hippurus, and two benthic gastropod species, strombus mutabilis and strombus wilsoni, were sampled as non-holozooplanktonic animals in the dispersal life history phase as pelagic larvae. these observations indicated that application of this analysis enables the estimation of larval dispersal, which is difficult to achieve based on morphological observations.

mollusca
to our knowledge, the discovery sond cruise  <cit>  is the only other attempt to date to estimate the species richness of a whole zooplankton community collected at a single site. in this series of studies  <cit> , a total of  <dig> species of zooplankton were identified and counted in samples collected around the canary islands . the extrapolated species richness  of the present study was estimated as  <dig>   using dotur  <cit> . our results cannot be directly compared with the sond cruise data because of differences in sampling effort between the two studies. in the sond cruise, two primary types of sampling equipment were used: isaacs-kidd midwater trawl and n113h.

furthermore, about  <dig> vertically stratified zooplankton samples that were collected above  <dig>  m were combined to estimate the occurrence of species  <cit> . in contrast, the present study was conducted based on a single sample collected from a depth of  <dig> m to the surface. these sampling effort differences may have accounted for the differences in species richness between the sond cruise and the present study. in addition, the lower species richness in the present study may have been due to our experimental design. in the present study, after construction of the cdna library from mrna, the mitochondrial coi genes were amplified with "universal " and polyt primers. it is possible that some of the mitochondrial coi gene sequences may not have been amplified due to primer mismatch for some species. although the single-gene zooplankton community analysis approach is an efficient means of collecting sequence information, given technical difficulties due to primer mismatch, further studies and the development of novel methodologies are required to gain a complete understanding of zooplankton diversity.

CONCLUSIONS
although the estimation of species richness and composition of the community are among the most important aspects of single-gene zooplankton community analysis, these sequence data will be further utilised by construction of a dedicated database. we expect that the accumulation of additional marine animal mitochondrial coi gene sequence data in the barcode project will aid in further clarifying sequences from unknown species. furthermore, this process of sequence assignment to particular species through database analysis indicated the occurrence of these species in the sampling site for the present study. we have now constructed a publicly accessible zooplankton community analysis database that can be searched using blastn  <cit> .

with regard to the future of zooplankton community genetic analysis, adoption of next-generation sequencing technology should enable researchers to read libraries sufficiently to estimate species richness without extrapolation  <cit> . we are currently expanding our sampling effort to all oceans to further understand zooplankton biodiversity.
