BACKGROUND
micrornas, the most sophisticatedly characterized small rna  species, were shown to play essential regulatory roles in gene expression in plants  <cit> . based on the high complementarity of the recognition sites on their targets, the plant mirnas exert repressive roles mostly through target rna cleavages at post-transcriptional level  <cit> . similar to the protein-coding genes, a dominant portion of mirna genes are transcribed by rna polymerase ii  <cit> . at the same time, the biogenesis and the activities of these critical small molecules themselves were under tight surveillance transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally  <cit> .

one novel mechanism involved in modulating mirna activities in plants was unraveled by franco-zorrilla et al.   <cit> . a 23-nt-long motif was observed to be highly conserved among the phosphate starvation-induced, non-coding rnas transcribed from the tpsi family genes including ips <dig> and at <dig>  in arabidopsis, this motif could be recognized by mir <dig>  but could not serve as an effective target cleavage site due to a 3-nt bulge on the “target” rna sequence opposite the position 10th to 11th nt of mir <dig> which is the canonical slicing site. intriguingly, the non-cleavable transcript acts as a target mimic to sequester the corresponding mirna, thus reducing the active level of mir <dig>  based on this result, the term “target mimicry” was coined to describe the target mimic—mirna regulatory relationships. by generating artificial mimics, the authors demonstrated that “target mimicry” might be not only implicated in phosphate signaling, but also in other biological processes, and the mechanisms might be widespread in plants  <cit> . by using the ips <dig> transcript as a scaffold, the subsequent research efforts generated a collection of target mimics in arabidopsis  <cit> , which were valuable for functional studies on certain mirna genes.

to date, however, only ips1—mir <dig> has been experimentally identified as an example of target mimicry that exists in planta naturally. although dozens of manipulated target mimics have shown great potential for modulating the activities of specific mirna genes, the widespread existence of the related mechanism in plants remains to be a pressing question. only one study by ivashuta et al.  was performed to partially uncover the natural target mimics of the mirnas in arabidopsis  <cit> . however, no in-depth analysis was performed except for some basic statistical results. besides, the old version of the mirna registries   <cit>  and the gene model annotations   <cit>  utilized in that study, and the exclusion of the currently available non-coding gene information may lead to insufficient exploration on this topic  <cit> .

here, by using the latest versions of the gene annotations from tair   <cit>  and tigr rice   <cit> , genome-wide in silico prediction of potential target mimics was performed for all the registered mirnas of arabidopsis and rice in mirbase   <cit> . the mirnas predicted to be sequestered by certain transcripts were further included for degradome sequencing data-based identification of the downstream targets. combining these two results, numerous target mimic—mirna—target regulatory relationships were extracted for comprehensive network construction. certain subnetworks were further analyzed, and some interesting findings were provided.

RESULTS
transcriptome-wide prediction of natural target mimics of plant mirnas
the latest versions of gene model annotations of arabidopsis and rice were retrieved from tair  <cit>  and tigr rice  <cit> , respectively, serving as the transcript database for the following prediction. all the mirbase-registered mirnas of both plants  were included to search for their complementary sites on the gene transcripts by using the tool ssearch belonging to the fasta <dig> package  <cit> . then, the search results were filtered to identify the potential target mimics of certain mirnas according to the rules established based on the previous experimental experiences  <cit>  . as a result,  <dig> and  <dig> mimic—mirna interactions were identified, involving  <dig> and  <dig> different mature mirnas in arabidopsis and rice, respectively . in ivashuta et al.’s study , only a limited set of non-coding transcripts from tair were included for target mimic prediction  <cit> . thus, the question whether the non-coding rnas tend to be more or less likely to function as target mimics needs to be addressed. to interrogate this issue, most currently available non-coding rna sequences were obtained from genomic trna database  <cit>  and noncode  <cit> . a same ssearch- and rule-based identification of target mimics was carried out. surprisingly, only one mimic of ath-mir <dig>  trna238-lysttt on chromosome  <dig>  was predicted to be a potential candidate in arabidopsis .

sequence characteristics of the target mimic sites and the sequestered mirnas
then, the distribution patterns of the predicted target mimic sites on the corresponding transcripts were analyzed . quite consistent in both plants, a dominant portion of the mimic sites reside within the cds  regions , although large portion locate within the utrs   . notably, more target mimic sites tend to distribute within the 3’ utrs  compared to the 5’ utrs  in both plants. to calculate the distribution density of the mimic sites, the total number of the mimic sites belonging to each region category  was divided by the summed length of the corresponding region sequences. thus, a normalized distribution density  was generated for each region category. surprisingly, the result presented a quite different view when compared to the result in figure 1a. the densities of the target mimic sites are much higher in utrs  when compared to those in cds regions  in both plants . it is also quite different from the previous observation that no significant difference was observed among the three categorized regions in arabidopsis   <cit> . we attributed this discrepancy to the different rules employed for target mimic site identification, since our search criteria were more stringent than the ones used in the previous study. our statistical result raised the presumption that the non-coding regions of the gene transcripts, i.e. the utrs, might be preferentially selected to serve as target mimic site-containing regions in plants. however, this possibility still needs verification.

next, the sequence features of the sequestered mirnas were characterized. compared to all the mirbase-annotated mirnas of arabidopsis and rice, the sequence length of the sequestered mirnas tends to be more enriched in  <dig> nt, and less enriched in  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nt . moreover, the 5’ terminal compositions of the sequestered mirnas tend to be more enriched in u , and less in a  . the first 15-nt sequences at both 5’ and 3’ ends of the sequestered mirnas were collected for sequence conservation analysis. when compared to the control sets , in both plants, the sequestered mirnas preferentially start with 5’ u , which was consistent with the above statistical results. more interestingly, the third nucleotides at the 3’ ends of the sequestered mirnas were found to be dominantly occupied by c  in rice, although it was less prominent in arabidopsis . further investigation of the canonical example, ips1—mir <dig>  revealed that all the mir <dig> family members of both arabidopsis and rice were  <dig> nt in length, and started with 5’ u, and the third nucleotides at their 3’ ends were c, only one exception was observed that the third nucleotide at the 3’ end of ath-mir399e was u. in this regard, whether these features, such as the third nucleotide at the 3’ end, could determine the probability that a specific mirna is regulated by certain target mimic needs to be further interrogated. together, all the evidences point to the fact that the mirnas tending to be sequestered by specific target mimics are more likely to possess the classic sequence features of plant mirnas  <cit> .

functional analysis of the target mimics
all the target mimics were included for go term enrichment analysis by using agrigo  <cit> . intriguingly, many identified enriched go terms were highly conserved between the two plants analyzed. for example, within the “biological process” category, the phosphorus metabolism-related processes such as “phosphorylation” were indicated to be enriched processes that the mimics were involved in . supporting this observation, within the “molecular function” category, “atp binding” and “kinase activity” which were implicated in phosphorus metabolism, were highly enriched functions possessed by the sets of target mimics in both plants . besides, the go terms “transcription factor activity” and “zinc ion binding” were also highly enriched in the target mimic gene set of arabidopsis. based on the gene annotations provided by tair and tigr, we found that a portion of the target mimics were encoded by transposable element  genes , indicating a novel functional activity of the tes for regulating the mirnas in plants. based on the tair annotations, five mimic genes, at1g <dig> regulating ath-mir159a, at2g <dig> regulating ath-mir <dig>  at1g <dig> modulating ath-mir <dig>  and at4g <dig> and at4g <dig> modulating ath-mir862-3p, were implicated in post-translational protein modification through a ubiquitin-related pathway .

uncovering the functions of the sequestered mirnas through target identification
most plant mirnas exert their regulatory roles in various biological processes through direct target cleavages  <cit> . to gain deeper functional insights of the mirnas regulated by the target mimics, large-scale target prediction was performed by using miru algorithm  <cit> . the predicted results were filtered by using degradome sequencing data-based approach in order to gain highly reliable mirna—target regulatory relationships . among the identified mirna—target pairs, some interesting regulations were observed. in arabidopsis, the precursors of ath-mir172b and ath-mir <dig> could be recognized by their own mature mirnas at the mirna*-coding regions, and significant cleavage signals were observed in the middle of the target regions . this observation further supports the “self-regulation” notion proposed previously  <cit> . in rice, both loc_os10g <dig>  and loc_os10g <dig>  were indicated to be co-regulated by osa-mir <dig> and osa-mir <dig> family members . additionally, alternative splicing employed by numerous genes may enable certain transcript variants to escape from mirna-mediated regulation. for instance, the splicing variant at5g <dig>  was found to be cleaved by ath-mir <dig>  while at5g <dig>  could not be targeted by this mirna due to the lack of the target recognition site.

a large portion of mirna targets have been demonstrated to be transcription factors in plants, suggesting their important role in gene regulatory cascades  <cit> . to gain a global functional view of these identified targets of the sequestered mirnas, go term enrichment analysis was performed again. as expected, “transcription factor activity” is a highly enriched function possessed by the target sets in both plants . interestingly, the go term “hydrolase activity, acting on acid anhydrides, in phosphorus-containing anhydrides” belonging to the “molecular function” category was found to be enriched in the rice target set . considering the functional enrichment of the target mimic genes in phosphorus metabolism-related processes in both arabidopsis and rice, the embedded implication is worth investigating. moreover, according to the go annotations, a large portion of the mirna targets in arabidopsis were suggested to be involved in the biological processes “rna interference”, “cell differentiation”, “vegetative  and reproductive  organ development”, and “meristem initiation” .

also based on target prediction and degradome data-based validation, certain target mimics were identified to be regulated by specific mirnas. for instance, the mimic transcripts at1g <dig>  and at5g <dig>  were indicated to be regulated by ath-mir <dig> and ath-mir <dig> respectively , and loc_os02g <dig>  was cleaved by osa-mir164a-f in rice .

construction of the networks constituted by “mirna—mimic—mirna—target” regulatory cascades and subnetwork characterization
through target mimic prediction and degradome data-based mirna target identification, the basic data for establishing the “mirna—mimic—mirna—target” regulatory relationships were obtained. thus, we set out to construct comprehensive networks involving target mimic—mirna regulations in both arabidopsis and rice by using cytoscape  <cit> . at first glance,  <dig> nodes  were found to be connected by  <dig> edges in arabidopsis, and  <dig> nodes connected by  <dig> edges in rice . to demonstrate the biological meanings of the constructed networks, certain subnetworks were further investigated.

in arabidopsis, the genes ips <dig>  and at <dig>  belonging to tpsi/mt <dig> family were identified as the target mimics of ath-mir <dig> , which was consistent with the previous experimental report  <cit> . it also indicates the high reliability of our criteria set for the prediction of target mimics. based on the same prediction criteria, the ips <dig> homologous gene loc_os03g <dig> was identified in rice . besides, several novel genes  not belonging to the tpsi/mt <dig> family were also indicated to have great potential to modulate the activities of mir <dig> in both plants. whether these potential mimics are involved in phosphate signaling needs to be further addressed. one example is that mir <dig> was predicted to be under surveillance of the mimic gene loc_os02g <dig> encoding an ethylene-responsive element-binding protein, suggesting a potential interplay between phosphorus and ethylene signaling pathways in rice. this scenario is supported by the recent finding that ethylene response factors are potentially implicated in the regulatory responses to phosphate deprivation in arabidopsis  <cit> . more interestingly, within the ath-mir399-involved subnetwork, one mimic transcript encoded by at5g <dig>  was found to be regulated by ath-mir <dig> through cleavage . to our best knowledge, ath-mir <dig> has never been uncovered to participate in the phosphorus-related signaling pathways. thus, the regulatory cascade ath-mir414—at4—ath-mir399—pho <dig>  is worth further investigating.

another novel finding was exploited from the mir159/319-, mir164- and mir395-involved subnetwork in rice . osa-mir <dig> was demonstrated to cleave the transcript loc_os02g <dig>  , which in turn regulated osa-mir395t through target mimicry. since mir <dig> and mir <dig> were reported to be involved in auxin signaling  <cit>  and sulfate metabolism  <cit>  respectively, the possibility that the auxin—sulfur signal interplay could be mediated by the cascade mir164—nac—mir <dig> needs in-depth investigations. however, we observed that only osa-mir395t was predicted to be regulated by the mimic transcript loc_os02g <dig> , and no downstream target was identified for this mirna based on degradome sequencing data. thus, whether the regulatory relationship, loc_os02g <dig> —osa-mir395t specifically exists in rice needs to be interrogated carefully. but, we suggest that the “target mimicry” relationship between nac family gene transcript and mir <dig> identified in this subnetwork may not be a false positive. another nac—mir <dig> relationship was identified between loc_os10g <dig>  and most of the mir <dig> family members in rice . more complicatedly, the target genes of osa-mir <dig>  loc_os03g <dig> and loc_os07g <dig>  encode transcription factors belonging to tcp family, which was demonstrated to positively regulate the expression of mir <dig> at the transcriptional level in arabidopsis  <cit> . thus, the regulatory cascade tcp—mir164—nac—mir <dig> may be at the nexus of the auxin and the sulfur signaling pathways. in arabidopsis, a largely conserved subnetwork involving mir159/ <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> was also extracted from the comprehensive network . however, no nac-related gene was discovered as a potential target mimic of mir <dig>  thus, whether the nac—mir395-mediated auxin—sulfur signal interaction is specifically existed in rice needs further interpretation. another interesting finding is that different from rice, in which mir <dig> and mir <dig> regulate distinct sets of target genes separately , mir <dig> and mir <dig> in arabidopsis share an overlapping set of targets. previous study indicates that although the sequences of mir <dig> and mir <dig> show high identity with each other, these two mirna species possess specialized functions by regulating distinct sets of targets, i.e. myb and tcp genes, separately  <cit> . our observation in arabidopsis indicated the partial functional redundancy between the two homologous mirna families. additionally, the mimic gene of ath-mir <dig>  at4g <dig>  is suggested to play a role in photosynthetic electron transfer based on tair annotation. on the other hand, the involvement of mir <dig> in plant photosynthesis is supported by several pieces of recent evidences  <cit> . notably, based on the previous study, the expression of at1g <dig>  a potential mimic of ath-mir395a/day/e, showed specific response to sulfur depletion treatment  <cit> . thus, the target mimicry relationship between at1g <dig> and ath-mir <dig> could add a potential layer of mir395-mediated sulfur signaling pathways.

several other interesting subnetworks were also extracted for characterization. for instances, only one member of mir <dig> families in both plants, i.e. ath-mir156h and osa-mir156k, was identified within the established comprehensive networks . both mimics and downstream targets were discovered for the two mir <dig> genes. thus, whether these two mir <dig> family members play a dominant role in specific regulatory pathway in both plants requires further investigations. based on our computational approach, the target genes of mir <dig> belonging to the ap <dig> family were identified based on the significant cleavage signals within the target sites in arabidopsis . thus, in addition to the previously reported translational repressive effect of mir <dig> on the ap <dig> genes  <cit> , target cleavages of the ap <dig> transcripts may also play an indispensable role in floral organ development. within the ath-mir169-mediated subnetwork, the mirna star species, ath-mir169g*, was found to be potentially regulated by three mimic transcripts, at1g <dig> , at4g <dig>  and at4g <dig>  . considering the widespread regulatory activities of mirna*s unraveled in recent years  <cit> , it is reasonable that the active levels of certain mirna*s should be under strict surveillance through target mimicry. in rice, a similar mir169-invovel subnetwork was identified, although no such mimic—mir169* regulatory relationship existed . however, based on the tigr rice annotations, two mimic genes of osa-mir <dig>  loc_os05g <dig> and loc_os09g <dig>  were suggested to be responsive to stress. considering the reported involvement of mir <dig> in drought  <cit>  and nitrogen starvation  <cit>  response in rice, the characterized subnetwork may play an essential role in multi-stress-induced response. moreover, the largest subnetwork involving mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> was identified in rice . these three mirna families seem to be rice-specific according to the current mirbase registries , and their biological functions have not been characterized. unfortunately, we could not gain any informative hints from the current annotations of the mimic and target genes within this subnetwork. hence, it will be interesting to gain functional insights from the established subnetwork through experimental approaches.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, comprehensive networks constituted by numerous target mimic—mirna—target regulatory cascades have been constructed in arabidopsis and rice through in silico target mimic site prediction and degradome data-based target identification. by in-depth characterization of certain interesting subnetworks, the established networks were demonstrated to be relatively reliable and biologically meaningful. several subnetworks were observed to be conserved between arabidopsis and rice to some extent . and some might be species-specific. we hope this study could expand the current view of mirna-mediated regulatory networks in plants, and will inspire more research efforts on the novel regulatory mechanisms for modulating mirna activities, such as the target mimicry characterized in our analysis.
