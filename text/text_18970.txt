BACKGROUND
vacuolar-type atpases  are ubiquitous proton pumps in the endomembrane system of all eukaryotic cells and in plasma membranes of many animal cells where they energize transport processes across the membrane or regulate the ph of corresponding compartments  <cit> . they are heteromultimeric enzymes consisting of a membrane bound, proton translocating vo complex and a catalytic v <dig> complex which is oriented towards the cytosol. in recent years it became more and more evident that malfunction of the v-atpase is correlated with a multitude of diseases such as osteopetrosis, male infertility or renal acidosis  <cit> . therefore the v-atpase turned out to be a subject for biomedical research and even was considered as a potential target for cancer drug therapy  <cit> . in order to understand the development of these diseases and to design efficient drugs for their therapy it is necessary to gain a most comprehensive knowledge of the mode of action of the enzyme as well as of known v-atpase inhibitors on the one hand, and, on the other hand, to search for novel potent and specific inhibitors with different inhibition characteristics.

the best examined and established specific v-atpase inhibitors are the plecomacrolides bafilomycin  <cit>  and concanamycin  <cit> , which both take effect in nanomolar concentrations by binding to the vo subunit c  <cit> . recently various new inhibitors of v-atpases such as the benzolactone enamides  <cit>  or chondropsines  <cit>  have been described  but so far in no case the binding site has been determined. only for the benzolactone enamide salicylihalamide it was shown that its binding site is different to that of plecomacrolides  <cit>  and may reside somewhere between the vo and the v <dig> complex  <cit> . in the present report we introduce two types of antibiotics produced by myxobacteria, apicularens, new benzolactone enamides  <cit>  and archazolids, a novel class of macrolactones  <cit>  which both represent highly potent and specific v-atpase inhibitors, however, with different modes of action and different binding sites.

RESULTS
archazolid and apicularen influence the viability of mammalian cell-lines
the novel antibiotics archazolids and apicularens  were checked for their impact on the cell growth of a variety of mammalian cell lines from different tissues . for nearly all of them ic <dig> values were in the nanomolar range, comparable with the ic <dig> values for concanamycin a and bafilomycin a <dig>  apicularen b was the only exception, with an average ic <dig> value two orders of magnitude higher. growth inhibition of the multidrug-resistant cell line kb-v <dig> was also measured in the presence of verapamil. as this compound inactivates the pgp efflux pump, a comparison of the ic <dig> values obtained in the presence and in the absence of verapamil revealed to which extent the compounds were pumped out of the cells by the mdr <dig> pgp. the data in tab  <dig>  show, that unlike the archazolids, the apicularens are poor substrates of pgp. to visualize the impact of the antibiotics, ptk <dig>  cells were incubated with the inhibitors and stained for intact acidic lysosomes . evidently, in the presence of apicularen a and archazolid a as well as in the presence of concanamycin a and of bafilomycin a <dig>  the red staining, indicating acidic lysosomes, disappeared compared to cells which had not been treated by drugs. the same observation was made with kb-3- <dig> cells . these results provided the first indication that the novel antibiotics, like concanamycin or bafilomycin, are interfering with the v-atpase which is the obligatory acidifier of lysosomes. unlike the cell lines listed in tab.  <dig>  the growth of ptk <dig> cells was not completely stopped. the same holds true for a- <dig> cells . both cell lines grow epithelial-like. there was obviously a differential reaction of cell lines to v-atpase inhibitors. for a- <dig> cells  a dependence on the expression of the egf receptor was shown  <cit> .

the v-atpase is highly sensitive to archazolid and apicularen
to verify our assumption, we tested the inhibitory efficacy of archazolid a and b as well as of apicularen a and b on the purified v-atpase holoenzyme from the midgut of the tobacco hornworm. as shown in fig.  <dig>  both archazolids inhibited the purified enzyme half-maximally at a concentration of ca.  <dig> nm, equivalent to an ic <dig> value of ca.  <dig>  nmol per mg of protein. apicularen a and b inhibited the purified enzyme half-maximally at concentrations of ca.  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm, respectively, equivalent to ic <dig> values of ca.  <dig>  nmol and  <dig>  nmol per mg of protein. these inhibitory values were in the same concentration range as those measured for the plecomacrolides concanamycin a, bafilomycin a <dig> and b <dig>  and of the benzolactone enamide salicylihalamide which all exhibited a half-maximal inhibition at ca.  <dig> nm and an ic <dig> of ca.  <dig>  nmol per mg of protein  <cit> . thus the novel compounds are highly efficient v-atpase inhibitors.

these findings confirmed our assumption that growth inhibition and the morphological changes induced by archazolid and by apicularen were due to their inhibitory effect on the v-atpase. apicularen b was slightly lower active compared to the other drugs, but the difference is much less than expected from the cell culture assays. this difference may result from a lower membrane permeability of apicularen b due to its additional n-acetyl-β-d-glucosamine residue.

while the macrolactones  and the benzolactone enamides  were shown to be potent growth inhibitors of cultured mammalian cells, they all failed to inhibit bacterial growth, while only archazolid showed weak activity against fungi; in addition, the benzolactone enamide salicylihalamide effectively inhibited mammalian v-atpases but not at all v-atpases from fungi such as saccharomyces cerevisiae or neurospora crassa  <cit> . since the tobacco hornworm v-atpase is very sensitive to all these antibiotics and available in milligram amounts, it appears to be an appropriate model for further investigations on the mechanism of inhibition by archazolid and the benzolactone enamides.

archazolid and apicularen do not appear to inhibit f-and p-atpases
having shown the high sensitivity of the v-atpase to the two novel antibiotics, we also wanted to estimate their inhibitory effect on f-and p-type atpases. in various cell cultures growth was inhibited at nanomolar concentrations . therefore we asked, whether a concentration of  <dig> μm which is fairly enough to knock out v-atpase activity and which is clearly higher than the ic <dig> values in the growth experiments, would also affect f-atpases such as the mitochondrial atp-synthase or p-atpases such as the plasma membrane na+/k+-atpase. thus, we prepared mitochondria rich crude membranes from mouse heart and submitochondrial particles from beef heart as well as highly purified, na+/k+-atpase containing plasma membranes from pig kidney, and tested the inhibitory potential of archazolid and of apicularen. to detect f-atpase activity we used its specific inhibitors, azide or oligomycin  <cit> , and ouabain or vanadate were used as specific inhibitors of the na+/k+-atpase  <cit> . whereas the atpase activity in the mouse and beef heart preparations was reduced to values around 25% by the specific f-atpase inhibitors azide or oligomycin, the new antibiotics archazolid and apicularen as well as the established specific v-atpase inhibitors concanamycin and bafilomycin reduced the activity only slightly to approximately 80% . an increase of the inhibitor concentration to  <dig> μm for archazolid and apicularen had no substantial effect. as shown in tab.  <dig>  na+/k+-atpase activity was completely inhibited by  <dig> mm vanadate and by  <dig> mm ouabain, whereas it was only slightly affected by apicularen a and by archazolid a. a slight inhibition of comparable size was also observed for the established inhibitor of v-atpases, concanamycin a, corroborating the well known fact that plecomacrolidic antibiotics start to inhibit p-atpases at concentrations in the micromolar range  <cit> . taken together our results with f-and p-atpases strongly suggest that archazolid and apicularen are specific v-atpase inhibitors.

archazolid and apicularen bind to different parts of the v-atpase
to investigate the mode of v-atpase inhibition in more detail, we used the semi synthetic derivative of concanamycin, 9-o-- <dig> -dideoxy-23-iodo-concanolide a  which already had been used successfully to identify the binding site of plecomacrolides in v-atpases unambiguously  <cit> . in our previous study we had shown that the vo subunit c is the only subunit of the v-atpase which is labelled by i-concanolide a and that this labelling could be prevented by pre-incubation with the plecomacrolides concanamycin a, bafilomycin a <dig> and b <dig>  in a comparable uv-radiation experiment labelling of subunit c by i-concanolide a was completely abolished by pre-incubation with archazolid a , thus indicating that plecomacrolides and archazolid a share, at least partially, the same binding site in subunit c.

unlike archazolid, the benzolactone enamide apicularen a did not appear to interfere with labelling of subunit c by the concanolide a derivative because the signal obtained was almost as strong as in the control . therefore we suggest that apicularen binds to a site which is largely different from that for the plecomacrolides. this result is in agreement with our former observation that the benzolactone enamide salicylihalamide does not bind to subunit c and supports our conclusion that the sites and mechanisms of inhibition for benzolactone enamides are different from those for plecomacrolides  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the novel antibiotics archazolid and apicularen are highly efficient and specific novel inhibitors of v-atpases. despite the different structures of archazolid and the plecomacrolides they probably have a similar mode of inhibition and their binding sites in the v-atpase have at least a considerable overlap. in contrast, apicularen which demonstrates the same inhibition efficacy does not interfere with i-concanolide a, thus suggesting a mode of inhibition different from that of the plecomacrolides.
