BACKGROUND
one of the most widely used microarray platforms is the affymetrix genechip. a genechip consists of a quartz wafer to which are attached some  <dig>  different 25-mer deoxyoligonucleotides, which are known as probes  <cit> . gene expression is measured by extracting mrna from the cells or tissues of interest and hybridising the mrna sample to the 25-mer probes on the microarray. each expressed transcript is represented on an array by a series of probe pairs known as a probe set  <cit> . each pair consists of a perfect match probe, with its 25-base sequence identical to the gene of interest, and a mismatch probe, whose sequence is the same as the perfect match except for position thirteen, where the base is set to the complementary of the perfect match. the mismatch probe was introduced by affymetrix as a measure of cross-hybridisation. each probe set on the affymetrix moe430a and rae230a arrays consists of  <dig> probe pairs, and is given a unique identifier consisting of a seven digit number, followed by the optional characters _s, _a, or _x, and ending in _at  <cit> .

during the array design process  <cit>  affymetrix collects sequences and annotations from various public databases including genbank, dbest and refseq. the sequences are aligned to the draft genome assembly for the relevant organism in order to assess sequence orientation and quality. the orientation of a sequence is determined by using consensus splice sites from genome alignments, detected polyadenylation sites, and coding sequence and est read direction annotations. unigene  <cit>  is used to create initial seed clusters of cdna sequences, which are further subdivided into subclusters representing distinct transcripts. a consensus sequence is a nucleotide sequence assembled by affymetrix based on all the member sequences in a subcluster  <cit> . probes are usually selected from the 600-base region at the 3' end of the consensus sequence. when there are alternative polyadenylation sites less than  <dig> bases apart only the probe selection region on the upstream polyadenylation site is used. the target sequence for a probe set is the part of the consensus sequence that the probes are taken from, starting with the first base of the most 5' probe and ending with the twenty-fifth base of the most 3' probe.

the aim of most gene expression microarray experiments is to obtain a list of genes which are differentially expressed under certain conditions. for the cases of multiple probe sets representing the same gene, the assumption would be that the expression levels should be upregulated or downregulated together. however, although this is the fundamental assumption behind microarray technology, we observe that this is not always the case. in order to elucidate the causes of these discrepancies we examined several cases where the expression levels of probe sets representing the same gene are not correlated, and we believe we have determined at least some of the likely reasons for this behaviour for the cases we examined.

RESULTS
the annotation of surf4
the mouse surfeit  <dig> gene, gene symbol surf <dig>  maps to the same eight probe sets in the affymetrix netaffx records for the moe430a array   <cit>  and in the bioconductor  <cit>  annotations for moe430a   <cit> . table  <dig> lists the  <dig> probe sets and the chromosomal alignments of the affymetrix target and consensus sequences for each probe set. table  <dig> details how the annotation of the probe sets by bioconductor has changed with time. we find a similar time-dependence in some of the affymetrix annotations   <cit> . the mouse surf <dig> gene is on the reverse strand of chromosome  <dig> . however, only five of the probe sets were correctly assigned to the reverse strand of chromosome  <dig>  whereas two probe sets align to the forward strand of chromosome  <dig> and one probe set aligns to chromosome  <dig>  the  <dig> probe sets which align to the forward strand of chromosome  <dig> are incorrectly assigned and should be assigned to surf <dig>  locusid  <dig> 

chromosomal coordinates are from the ucsc october  <dig> mouse assembly  <cit> .

surf <dig> and surf <dig> are part of the surfeit gene locus, an unusual cluster of six housekeeping genes on chromosome  <dig>  which are not related either by sequence or function  <cit> . adjacent genes in the cluster are transcribed in opposite directions. figure  <dig> shows a screen shot of the ucsc genome browser  <cit>  on the region of mouse chromosome  <dig> containing surf <dig> and surf <dig>  surf <dig> specifies two major mrnas, a more abundant transcript of  <dig>  kb and a less abundant transcript of  <dig>  kb  <cit> . the poly addition signals are in the 3' utr, at  <dig> –  <dig> for the  <dig>  kb transcript and at  <dig> –  <dig> for the  <dig>  kb transcript. the 3' end of the  <dig>  kb transcript overlaps the 3' end of surf <dig> by  <dig> base pairs. the  <dig> surf <dig> probe sets were mapped to the genomic sequence of chromosome  <dig> as shown in figure  <dig>  all  <dig> probe sets mapped to the 3' utr region on exon  <dig> of surf <dig>  note that probe sets 1416213_x_at and 1436797_a_at have  <dig> probes in common, and probe sets 1434589_x_at and 1455822_x_at have  <dig> probes in common. probe sets 1416213_x_at and 1436797_a_at would detect both the  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb surf <dig> transcripts, whereas probe sets 1448255_a_at, 1434589_x_at and 1455822_x_at would detect only the longer  <dig>  kb transcript.

the assignment of probe set 1427285_s_at to surf <dig> is clearly an error. the affymetrix netaffx record  for this probe set is inconsistent, with one section  showing that the target sequence for the probe set aligns to chromosome  <dig>  but another section  showing that the surf <dig> gene is on chromosome  <dig>  the error probably comes from the genbank record for the est ai <dig>  <cit> , which affymetrix gives as the representative sequence for this probe set   <cit> . the genbank record includes the terms 'similar to mouse surfeit locus surfeit  <dig> protein gene' in the defline. an alignment of the ai <dig> sequence to the ucsc march  <dig> assembly of the mouse genome using blat  <cit>  showed that the first  <dig> bases from the 5' end of the 569-base sequence align perfectly to chromosome  <dig>  while the  <dig> bases starting from the 3' end align perfectly to chromosome  <dig>  the probes for probe set 1427285_s_at align perfectly to chromosome  <dig>  and to the part of the ai <dig> sequence that maps to chromosome  <dig>  the bioconductor annotation method starts from ai <dig>  this is an est and is not found in locuslink  <cit> . searching the unigene mouse build # <dig> mm.data file  <cit>  shows that ai <dig> is in cluster mm. <dig>  surf <dig>  which maps to locusid  <dig>  surf <dig> 

observations of the expression of the eight probe sets matches the expectations from the annotation analysis
the gene expression omnibus   <cit>  record gse <dig> is an 11-point time course study of differentiating j <dig> embryoid bodies in mus musculus  <cit> . the experiment consists of triplicate observations, made at  <dig> hr,  <dig> hr,  <dig> hr,  <dig> hr,  <dig> hr,  <dig> hr,  <dig> hr,  <dig> days,  <dig> days,  <dig> days and  <dig> days. we calculated the pearson correlation coefficient between different pairs of probe sets using the mean value at each time point.

differential expression of rat probe sets mapping to the same gene
the rae230a rat expression data was generated by members of the london pain consortium  or extracted from geo  <cit> . the first lpc experiment measured differential expression in spinal cord tissue from a rat model of spinal long-term potentiation  under two conditions, sham operation and operation followed by stimulation sufficient to induce ltp , hereafter referred to as the ltp experiment. the second lpc experiment studied dorsal root ganglia of rat under two conditions, sham operation and operation followed by exposure to nerve growth factor , hereafter referred to as the ngf experiment. record gse <dig>  which we extracted from geo, measures gene expression in rat kidney for two conditions, normo- and hypotensive animals  <cit> , and is hereafter referred to as the kidney experiment. the rat datasets were chosen because the lpc experiments measure gene expression in related experiments, whereas gse <dig> measures gene expression from an unrelated experiment, and so this enabled us to see if the results for these different experiments bear any relation to each other. the cel files were processed using gcrma  <cit> , and the sliding z-scores method of quackenbush  <cit>  was used to measure differential expression.

results for the ltp experiment
 <dig> locusids mapped to more than  <dig> probe set in the bioconductor mar/ <dig> rae230a annotations. variances in the z-scores of probe sets mapping to the same locusid ranged from  <dig>  × 10- <dig> to  <dig> , with  <dig> locusids having z-score variances greater than  <dig> . table  <dig> shows the groups of probe sets resulting in the  <dig> largest z-score variances.

alternative splicing
locusid  <dig> had the largest z-score variance. locusid  <dig> maps to probe sets 1369116_a_at, 1369117_at and 1370775_a_at , and corresponds to the rat calcitonin alpha/calcitonin gene-related peptide  gene. the mammalian calca/cgrp gene has six exons, and is considered a model gene for the study of alternative splicing  <cit> . splicing together the first four exons produces the mrna for calcitonin alpha, whereas splicing together exons one to three, five and six produces the mrna for cgrp . the mrna is processed in a tissue-specific manner to produce mainly the serum calcium-regulating hormone calcitonin in thyroid c cells, whereas in neuronal cells the major product is cgrp, a neuropeptide. as shown in figure  <dig> the probes in probe set 1369116_a_at map to exons  <dig> and  <dig>  which would be present in both calcitonin and cgrp transcripts. the probes in probe set 1369117_at map to exon  <dig>  which would only be present in calcitonin mrna, whereas the probes in probe set 1370775_a_at map to exons  <dig> and  <dig>  which would only be present in cgrp mrna. note that the first probe in probe set 1370775_at maps to the splice junction between the 3' end of exon  <dig> and the 5' end of exon  <dig> 

alignment of the target sequences to the ucsc june  <dig> rat genome assembly was performed using blat  <cit> .

alternative polyadenylation sites
the locusid with the second highest z-score variance was locusid  <dig>  with a z-score variance of  <dig> . locusid  <dig> corresponds to the rat snf1-like kinase  gene and maps to probe sets 1368596_at and 1368597_at . the consensus sequences for the two probe sets are identical . the probe sets are about  <dig> bp apart, and were designed to detect transcripts produced using alternative polyadenylation sites.

adjacent genes on opposite strands
the locusid with the third highest z-score variance was locusid  <dig>  with a z-score variance of  <dig> . locusid  <dig> maps to probe sets 1370114_a_at and 1371776_at  and corresponds to the gene phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, regulatory subunit, polypeptide  <dig> . however, the target and consensus sequences for probe set 1370114_a_at align to the reverse strand of chromosome  <dig>  whereas the target and consensus sequences for probe set 1371776_at align to the forward strand of chromosome  <dig> , so the two probe sets cannot possibly represent the same gene. thus the difference in z-scores is due to the fact that the two probe sets are measuring different genes, rather than different transcripts from the same gene.

the affymetrix netaffx record   <cit>  for probe set 1371776_at warns that this is an e-grade annotation, based only on ests. the assignment was obtained from the current unigene cluster containing the genbank est aa <dig>  the representative public id for this probe set.

the results for the ngf and kidney experiments
rank comparisons between the rae230a experiments
tables  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> illustrate the ten largest discrepancies in differential expression for probe sets mapping to the same locusid for three different experiments. in each case we are able to assess a likely cause for the discrepancy, whether it is based on biological phenomena such as alternative splicing and polyadenylation or annotation errors.

phenomena such as alternative splicing or polyadenylation need to be tightly regulated on a genomic scale. we therefore expect that it be may possible to discover evidence for co-regulated splicing and polyadenylation for different sets of genes. we have made a first search for co-regulated families of probe sets by cross-comparing the ranks in three different experiments. table  <dig> shows one such comparison, the top ten ranked locusids in the ltp data set, compared with their ranks in the ngf and kidney data sets. the two top ranked locusids in the ngf data set were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, while the two top ranked locusids in the kidney data set were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. two locusids,  <dig> and  <dig>  whose variances in differential expression are due to annotation errors, were found to be common to the ltp and ngf experiments, and this provides some support for our search strategy. however, we have found no evidence in support of co-regulated splicing and polyadenylation between different genes, but we acknowledge that our dataset  may be too limited to reliably perform this task.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the goal of biologists performing gene expression microarray experiments is to obtain a list of genes that are upregulated or downregulated under particular conditions. analysis of affymetrix microarray data yields expression values for probe sets, which are converted into expression values for genes by the probe set annotations. certain genes are represented by two or more probe sets on affymetrix genechips, and it could be naively assumed that the multiple representations should all tell a consistent picture, i.e. they will all indicate that the gene is either up-regulated, down-regulated or unchanged. however, our analysis shows that the reality is actually more complicated, and perhaps more interesting than the naïve assumption.

multiple probe sets assigned to the same gene were found to detect cases of alternative splicing, use of alternative poly sites, or errors. these conclusions were reached from the examination of the eight probe sets mapped to the mouse surf <dig> gene. we have also compared the differential expression in three different rat experiments, and in each case we have found a number of probe sets which are assigned to the same gene but show a variety of differential expression changes some of which are inconsistent . furthermore, in some cases one probe set measures more than one transcript. for example, in the case of the three probe sets mapping to the rat calcitonin/cgrp gene, probe set 1369116_a_at detects both splice forms. for this particular probe set, it is therefore possible that it will detect multiple transcripts, whose relative abundance will differ under distinctive biological conditions. it is therefore likely that other experiments will also find similar effects, and for different genes to the ones we describe here. we recommend that as a matter of course, it should not be assumed by an experimentalist that multiple representations of the same gene are actually measuring the same transcript. each probe set should be treated independently and should not be averaged, or used in any way which assumes that they are different samples from an underlying uniform population. our findings are in close agreement with other similar analyses of probe set mappings  <cit> . the analysis of harbig et al.  <cit>  suggests that over one-third of probe sets on the hg-u <dig> plus  <dig>  genechip array detect multiple transcripts, suggesting that accurate annotations are needed before genechip data can be reliably interpreted. the novelty of our work is in the use of differential expression measures as a source of data with which to benchmark annotations.

frequently the lists of genes observed to be differentially expressed are eye-balled by the experienced biologist familiar with the literature on earlier experiments. indeed, a gene for assessing the quality control of the ltp experiment is calcitonin/cgrp, which shows evidence for alternative splicing, and in the ngf experiment brain-derived neurotrophic factor , which shows evidence for alternative polyadenylation and opioid receptor mu  <dig> , which may be undergoing alternative splicing. the analysis we describe here may help to circumvent the possibility that an experienced experimentalist will discard the results because the list of differentially expressed genes contains a name that should not be there  or doesn't contain a name that should be there . our analysis indicates that genechips are measuring a range of biological phenomena, and certainly much more than their standard use as a surrogate for determining which proteins are most likely to be differentially regulated. indeed, it is important to better include our knowledge of the transcriptome, before we interpret genechip data in terms of a protein measure. in particular, alternative splicing may result in different protein isoforms, and so it should be established which particular isoform is of interest to the experimentalist, before determining which probe set, or subset of probes, provide the best diagnostic of the mrna that will go on to generate the protein.

alternative polyadenylation does not modify the form of the protein, but it does act to change the structure of the 3' utr, as indeed does alternative splicing. the 3' utr frequently contains motifs related to mrna control and regulation  <cit> , and so transcripts undergoing differential polyadenylation, and splicing, may actually modify the expression rates and location of the corresponding protein. genechips contain probes falling on separate sides of a polyadenylation signal, and so, in principle, genechips can be used as a discovery tool for finding families of co-regulated polyadenylation decisions. however, to our knowledge, nobody has reported such a use in the literature.

our knowledge of the transcriptome is rapidly evolving and it appears that genomes in higher eukaryotes, at least, produce a range of overlapping transcripts and chimeras  <cit> . the design of affymetrix genechips occurred prior to this knowledge, but it made heavy use of est databases which will have included transcripts with the exotic forms that are now being re-discovered. this may account for why probes are frequently found to align beyond the refseq sequence for the corresponding gene. it is therefore likely that affymetrix genechips have the potential to be used as a discovery tool for exploring the exotic transcriptome, and go beyond their standard use as a measure of mrna for protein-coding genes. to our knowledge, there has been little use of genechips in this way, but given that there are now large repositories of genechips in geo  <cit>  and other repositories, a systematic survey of probes not corresponding to refseqs may discover interesting biological phenomena associated with the exotic transcriptome.
