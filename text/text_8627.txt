BACKGROUND
hsp60-like chaperonin proteins are well known for their role in assisting protein folding and in protecting cells from the deleterious effects of stress  <cit> . the eukaryotic cell expresses representatives of two distinct groups of chaperonin genes that are otherwise typical of bacteria  or archaea . in eukaryotes, group i chaperonins are mostly expressed in mitochondria and chloroplasts, and group ii chaperonins are found in the eukaryotic cytosol  <cit> . chaperonin proteins form typical multi-subunit double-ringed structures collectively called "chaperonins"  <cit> . the group i chaperonins are typically formed by the products of a single gene  assembled into a 14-subunit double-ringed structure in bacteria and into a double or single-ringed structure in mitochondria  <cit> . eukaryotic group ii chaperonin proteins assemble in a similar double-ringed oligomeric structure, called tric or cct complex  <cit> , composed of  <dig> subunits that in human are encoded by nine distinct genes   <cit> . the cct complex is mostly known for its role in folding the cytoskeleton proteins actin and tubulin  <cit>  and mutations in individual cct subunits lead to defects in the functioning of the cytoskeleton and mitosis arrest  <cit> .

as for other chaperones, the malfunctioning of chaperonin proteins has been associated with various human pathological conditions, the chaperonopathies  <cit> . in this respect, besides the canonical cct and cpn <dig> genes described above, three divergent hsp60-like genes have been more recently identified  <cit>  in association with pathological conditions. one gene, mkks  <cit> , was named for its association with the developmental disease mckusick-kaufman syndrome and was soon after also identified as bbs <dig>  <cit>  for its association with the bardet-biedl syndrome , another developmental condition involving cilium-related dysfunction  <cit> . more recently two other hsp60-like bbs genes, named bbs <dig>  <cit>  and bbs <dig>  <cit> , have been identified among fourteen genes  so far associated with bbs. the protein products of mkks/bbs <dig>  bbs <dig> and bbs <dig> localize to the basal body of cilia and to the centrosome  <cit> . we will hereafter refer to the mkks/bbs <dig> gene as mkks, and collectively to the three hsp60-like bbs genes as the "bbs genes". the identification of these genes provides new perspectives on the spectrum of functionalities of hsp60-like proteins in eukaryotes and on their role in development.

the recognition of chaperonopathies has increased the importance of elucidating the entire set of chaperone genes present in the human genome  <cit> . the work reported here was conceived to: a) identify all hsp60-like sequences encoded in the human and other genomes including all diverged chaperonin genes; b) reconstruct the evolutionary origins and relations of diverged chaperonin genes; c) distinguish with bioinformatics methods functional genes from pseudogenes; d) characterize structural properties of the corresponding proteins. we mostly devoted our attention to the characterization of the evolutionary history and structural properties of newly or recently identified sequences, referring the reader to the vast amount of published literature for information on functional/structural properties and the evolutionary history of mitochondrial cpn <dig> or cct-complex proteins.

exhaustive searches of hsp60-like sequences were carried out in human and other genomes following and extending our "chaperonomics" methodological protocol  <cit> . the extensive analysis of the genomes of human and other vertebrate species lead to the identification and characterization of many previously unknown sequences and to the discovery of a new, mammal-specific class of chaperonin proteins. classification, evolutionary analysis and structural characterization of diverged chaperonin-like sequences should provide valuable information for future studies on the functional roles of these proteins.

RESULTS
chaperonin sequences in the human genome
to identify all human hsp60-like sequences we queried the human genome using the nine human cct subunit and mitochondrial cpn <dig> sequences. analogous extensive searches were performed in the mouse and rat genomes using corresponding queries. in the human genome, we found a total of  <dig> sequences with significant similarity to hsp <dig> proteins . fifteen sequences had a ncbi entrez  <cit>  gene descriptor assigned. nine of these corresponded to the canonical cct-subunit sequences and one, hspd <dig>  encoded the mitochondrial cpn <dig> protein. three sequences corresponded to the bbs genes mkks, bbs <dig> and bbs <dig>  we recovered two additional uncharacterized sequences designated in the ncbi entrez gene database as cct8l <dig> and cct8l <dig>  besides these complete hsp60-like sequences, a sequence domain conserved across eukaryote species with highest similarity to the apical domain of the cct <dig> protein has also been reported in pikfyve  <cit> , a kinase belonging to the fab1p protein family involved in corneal pathological conditions  <cit> . in addition, we identified  <dig> other human hsp <dig> sequences that did not correspond to a gene descriptor in the ncbi entrez gene database . all of these sequences contained in-frame stop codons or frame-shifts, suggesting that they were most likely pseudogenes. thirty-five of these had not been described in the pseudogene.org pseudogene database  <cit>  and  <dig> were not listed in the ensembl database  <cit> , and are here annotated and classified for the first time. in analogous searches of the complete genomes of mouse and rat, we identified in each genome  <dig> chaperonin genes ,  <dig> pseudogenes in mouse and  <dig> pseudogenes in rat .

evolutionary origins of human bbs and cct8l genes
a maximum-likelihood  phylogenetic tree of human chaperonin-like proteins  indicated that hsp60-like bbs proteins are monophyletic  and that their common ancestor derived from a duplication event in the cct <dig> lineage . the tree also showed that the unique ancestor of the two closely related genes cct8l <dig> and cct8l <dig> also originated in the cct <dig> lineage from a more recent duplication event . the relation of bbs and cct8l proteins with the cct <dig> chaperonin subunit was confirmed with strong conditional probability support  by bayesian tree construction .

although the association of bbs and cct8l proteins with the cct lineage was robustly supported, the high divergence of these sequences could produce clustering in the trees due to long-branch attraction. to address this concern, we built independent ml trees for each bbs or cct8l sequence adding them separately to the tree of cct subunits. all individual trees confirmed with strong bootstrap support the association of each bbs or cct8l lineage with the cct <dig> lineage . a ml evolutionary tree including hsp60-gene homologs found in the genomes of eighteen other vertebrate species, including representatives of several mammals, chicken, frogs, and fish, also confirmed the origin of bbs and cct8l genes from the cct <dig> lineage .

we did not find cct8l genes in the genomes of chicken, xenopus laevis, or danio rerio, representatives respectively of the reptile/bird, amphibian and fish lineages. however, among mammals we identified orthologs of cct8l genes in genomes not only of placental mammals , but also of the marsupial opossum  and of the egg-laying platypus , suggesting that the cct8l gene class originated at the onset of mammal evolution. all cct8l gene orthologs were intron-less, indicating that their ancestor originated from a retro-transposition event. two copies of cct8l sequences were found in human and chimp and one cct8l gene in all other genomes examined, including those from the other primate rhesus monkey  and gray mouse lemur  , suggesting that a duplication of the cct8l gene occurred in hominoidea after their separation from old world monkeys. however, the lone gene copy of cct8l identified in rhesus monkey clustered with cct8l <dig> in evolutionary trees , suggesting an earlier duplication of the gene and successive loss of the cct8l <dig> copy from the genome of rhesus monkey. close inspection of protein alignments revealed that the rhesus monkey cct8l sequence included an anomalously diverged segment of about  <dig> amino acids of uncertain alignment. excluding this segment from the analysis we obtained a different and more robustly supported tree topology , consistent with a later duplication of the cct8l gene in hominoidea. the tree also indicated that the removed segment was alone responsible for the overall higher evolutionary rate predicted for this sequence .

differentiation rate of bbs and cct8l proteins
the branch lengths of the trees shown in figure  <dig> indicate that bbs and cct8l proteins have differentiated at much higher rates than cct subunits. we applied a newly-developed, unbiased measure of differentiation called "b-index"  to calculate differentiation of mkks, bbs <dig> and bbs <dig> proteins from their respective last ancestor common to actinopterygii  and sarcopterygii , determined by rooting the trees with cct <dig> proteins from corresponding fish and tetrapod species. similarly, we calculated differentiation of cct8l proteins from a eutherial ancestor rooting their tree with corresponding sets of cct <dig> proteins . we estimated for the mkks family an average evolutionary distance from their root of almost  <dig>  substitutions per site, corresponding to a 6-fold higher rate of differentiation compared to the number of substitutions estimated in cct <dig> proteins over the same period of time. for bbs <dig> and bbs <dig>  we calculated a distance of about  <dig> - <dig>  substitutions per site, corresponding to a substitution rate about 8- <dig> times higher than in cct <dig>  finally, for the mammal-specific family of cct8l proteins, we estimated an evolutionary distance from their mammal root of about  <dig>  substitutions per site. the smaller divergence of cct8l proteins compared to bbs proteins reflects the more recent origin of the cct8l gene. however, when scaled to the evolution of cct <dig> sequences over the same periods of time, the substitution rate of cct8l proteins was about 14- <dig> times higher than in cct <dig> and  <dig> - <dig>  times higher than in bbs proteins.

1only the human cct8l <dig> branch was included in the tree. the cct8l <dig> branch had equivalent length; 2chaperonin-bbs sequences used in the trees were from the following species . mkks: bt, cf, dr, ec, ga, gg, hs, md, mm, mmu, ol, rn, tr, xt; bbs10: bt, cf, dr, ec, ga, hs, md, mm, ol, rn, tr; bbs12: bt, cf, dr, ec, ga, gg, hs, mm, ol, rn, tr, xl; cct8l: bt, cf, hs, mm, rn. 3size is the average number of sequences contained in a cluster over evolutionary time ; 4the b-index measures the average substitutions per site  of the sequences within a cluster from their common ancestor; 5l is the length of the tree ; 6average dij is the average pair-wise evolutionary distance of the sequences; 7estimates for cct <dig> were computed over corresponding species represented by the sets of mkks, bbs <dig>  bbs <dig> or cct8l proteins .

functional constraints in the evolution of cct8l genes
we tested functionality of cct8l genes from several species estimating ratios of non-synonymous and synonymous substitution rates  along their respective lineages . the results of this analysis are shown in table  <dig>  which indicates the gene analyzed , the two genes used to identify foreground and background branches, the estimated ka/ks values and their significance. the evolutionary lineages for which ka/ks values were evaluated correspond to the branch numbers identified in the overall tree topology shown in figure  <dig>  in this tree are represented the "molecular tree" of mammal phylogenetic relations  <cit> , the gene duplication event involving the cct8l gene family in primates as inferred by this analysis, and the pre-mammal separations of the cct <dig>  cct <dig> and cct8l families of paralogs. this topology is in agreement with the evolutionary tree of cct8l genes  with the only exception of the weakly supported position of the cct8l sequence from rhesus monkey . the highly significant constraints in non-synonymous substitution rates  estimated in the overall evolution of the cct8l family  indicated that the cct8l sequences are genes generally expressing functional proteins. in evaluating ka/ks ratios for individual cct8l gene lineages , significantly constrained evolution  was detected for branches leading to most sequences, including those of murids, lemur, cow, dog, elephant, marsupial, and to the human cct8l <dig> and cct8l <dig> group along the hominoid lineage. constrained evolution was also estimated for the cct8l genes of armadillo and rhesus monkey, and for human cct8l <dig> and human and chimp cct8l <dig> after divergence of human and chimp, although in these cases ka/ks values did not reach significance. in the cases of the human and chimp cct8l <dig> and cct8l <dig> genes, the lack of significance can be related to the loss of power of the test since few mutations accumulated after separation of these sequences . in the case of rhesus monkey cct8l, we found that its relatively high estimate of ka/ks  was due to the previously mentioned 50-amino-acid diverged region within this sequence. after removing this region we estimated ka/ks =  <dig> . only for the lineage of chimp cct8l <dig> we estimated ka/ks ≅  <dig>  consistent with differentiation of a non-functional sequence. since this sequence was also characterized by an internal stop codon and a frame-shift, all evidence strongly suggests that chimp cct8l <dig> is a pseudogene.

to assess the functionality of human cct8l sequences we investigated their expression profiles in comparison to those of human cct monomers and bbs genes . expression of cct8l <dig> was confirmed by fifteen ests mostly identified from the testis, whereas only one est identified as a cct8l <dig> transcript has been so far reported . querying the ncbi geo microarray database, we found  <dig> expression-profile records identifying expression of cct8l <dig>  and none identifying expression of cct8l <dig> . it must be noted, however, that cct8l <dig> and cct8l <dig> have similarity of  <dig> % at the dna level. similarly to cct8l <dig>  another mammal-specific chaperonin gene, cct6b, is also expressed almost exclusively in the testis, from which  <dig> ests have been reported versus an average of  <dig>  ests  found in all other tissues.

pseudogenes
we identified in the human genome  <dig> sequences with significant similarity to cct or hspd <dig> genes that either were short fragments or were characterized by in-frame stop codons or frame-shifts. based on their corruption, we classified these sequences as pseudogenes . similarly, searching the mouse and rat genomes we identified  <dig> and  <dig> pseudogenes, respectively . most of these sequences have not been previously reported and are here systematically annotated and classified for the first time.

based on phylogenetic-tree reconstructions  or on similarity for the most corrupted sequences, we identified the association of  <dig> pseudogenes from human,  <dig> from mouse and  <dig> from rat with one of the nine cct genes. none of the pseudogenes were related to mkks, bbs <dig>  bbs <dig> or cct8l. to estimate the time of origin of the pseudogenes, we constructed trees using their translated sequences and chaperonin subunits from various vertebrate species . the trees indicated that all recognizable human cct pseudogenes originated in the mammal lineage after separation from the reptile/bird lineage.

of particular interest were the evolutionary relations of cct <dig> genes and pseudogenes. two cct <dig> gene copies  were found, besides placental mammals, also in platypus and in opossum , suggesting that the duplication of the cct <dig> gene occurred in mammal evolution before separation of theria  and prototheria . we constructed an evolutionary tree of mammal cct <dig> genes and pseudogenes  rooted by the corresponding gene sequences from chicken and frog . surprisingly, all recognizable human, mouse, and rat pseudogenes belonging to the cct <dig> class branched in the tree from the cct6a lineage after separation of the platypus, marsupial and placental mammal lineages.

twenty-two pseudogenes in human , and  <dig> and  <dig> pseudogenes in mouse and rat, respectively , associated with the mitochondrial hspd <dig> gene . evolutionary trees incorporating all pseudogenes from different vertebrate species were uninformative due to the presence among the pseudogenes of highly corrupted sequences, resulting in extensive long-branch attraction . an ml tree built using only translations of the most conserved pseudogenes  showed weakly supported but consistent association of the human pseudogenes with hspd <dig> from primates, whereas pseudogenes from mouse and rat all associated with murid hspd <dig> sequences, also indicating their relatively recent origin.

ka/ks ratio in the evolution of putative pseudogene sequences
our characterization of many hsp <dig> sequences as pseudogenes was based on the presence of signs of corruption in the sequence . however, in-frame stop codons and frame-shifts may correspond to truncated proteins that are still functional. for example, although human hspd1-5p and hspd1-6p sequences contain signs of sequence corruption, est data indicate that these sequences are expressed and possibly functional . to confirm our characterization, we estimated ka/ks ratios in trees that identified the pseudogene-sequence lineage  including as out-group its parental gene and the orthologous gene sequence from chicken . the results of these analyses  showed in most cases ka/ks values not significantly different from  <dig> , as expected in the differentiation of pseudogene sequences not constrained by coding of functional amino acids. significant differences in mutation rate were estimated in the case of four sequences. these sequences, however, contained multiple in-frame stop codons and frame-shifts .

structural features of bbs and cct8l proteins
because of their high sequence divergence, it is unclear whether bbs and cct8l hsp60-like proteins conserve the typical fold of chaperonin subunits and their ability to assemble into typical oligomeric chaperonin complexes. chaperonin monomers are characterized by three structural domains  with distinct functional roles and it was relevant to investigate whether bbs and cct8l proteins conserve each of the domains typical of chaperonins. experimental models of eukaryotic group ii chaperonins are not available but their structural properties can be inferred by comparison with their closest relative, the archaeal thermosome. to infer tertiary-structure conservation in bbs and cct8l proteins we predicted the secondary structure for each family from alignments of multiple sequences, excluding structure and sequence information from other families. the results of these predictions are schematically represented in figure 6a, in relation to the secondary structure description of the pdb structure 1a6d chain a of the thermosome subunit thsa from thermoplasma acidophilum  <cit>  . in figure 6a, the secondary structure description of thsa is shown  in relation to the position of the equatorial, intermediate, and apical domains. the position of these elements in the tertiary structure of thsa is represented in figure 6b. results of a blind test of the performance of the method on the corresponding thsa sequence are also shown . in this test most strand and helix elements  described in the crystal structure were correctly predicted by the method, increasing our confidence in the reliability of other predictions. as expected, extensive conservation of predicted secondary-structure elements were also obtained from the alignment of human cct sequences  with only few discrepancies involving mostly short beta strands  and one short helix  exposed at the external surface of the archaeal thermosome complex. secondary-structure predictions for mammal cct8l and for vertebrate mkks, bbs <dig> or bbs <dig> sequences were also largely consistent with the secondary-structure description of thermosome proteins. in the equatorial domain, cct8l and bbs structure predictions corresponded to the mostly alpha-helical composition of this region. variations were more obvious in bbs <dig> and involved mostly terminal elements of helices  and exposed beta-strands . in the intermediate domain the core helical-bundle elements  as well as the extensive beta-sheet composition of this region were predicted in all bbs and cct8l proteins. exceptions were, in all sequences, the two short strands  <dig> and  <dig>  which are part of an external elongated loop in the thermosome structure, and, in bbs <dig>  the n-terminal part of helix k, which in the thermosome protrudes towards the central cavity covering the atp hydrolysis site . the apical domain is formed in the thermosome by a 4-strand anti-parallel beta-sheet  with strand  <dig> extending into a second parallel beta-sheet . the two sheets are flanked by a helix  and are surmounted by a structure composed of two contacting helices  and an extended loop including strand  <dig>  all helices and most strands of the apical domain were recognized in bbs sequences. most obvious differences were observed in bbs <dig> proteins, where the long apical helix h was predicted to be shortened, and in cct8l, where helix i and strand  <dig> were not predicted.

differentiation of monomer-monomer interaction regions in bbs and cct8l proteins
to investigate the potential of cct8l and bbs proteins to establish intra-ring and inter-ring monomer-monomer contacts, we investigated the relative conservation of predicted contact positions in cct, bbs and cct8l sequences. we identified potential contact positions in these families based on homology to the positions involved in inter-monomer contacts in the crystal structure of the t. acidophilum thermosome complex . after identifying all contact positions in cct monomers, we distinguished among them those that conserved similar amino acid types across the nine monomers. we counted how many amino acid types observed in all or in conserved contact positions of cct monomers were also observed in the t. acidophilum thsa sequence, in human cct8ls or in human bbs sequences . a complete list of all and conserved positions considered and of the residue types observed in these positions in all sequences can be found in additional file 21: table s <dig>  thsa and cct subunits conserve 89% similarity in monomer-monomer contact positions, which is substantially higher than the average similarity  of all homologous positions between the two families. the higher similarity of monomer-monomer contact regions is consistent with functional conservation between the two families of these positions. in contrast, the high rate of differentiation in comparison to global average differentiation shown in putative monomer-monomer contact positions in bbs or cct8l sequences , suggests a loss of capability to associate into a typical cct-like oligomeric complex. this result is consistent with the presence in bbs proteins of inserted elements  that would interfere with formation of the complex  <cit> .

1conservation of archaeal thsa and human bbs and cct8l sequences relative to human cct monomers. sequence-positions are considered conserved if they are occupied by residue-types appearing in the homologous position in any of the human cct sequences. ninety-three intra-ring contact positions and  <dig> inter-ring contact positions were identified from the thermosome structure . contact positions were defined by a distance of their side-chain heavy atoms of at most  <dig> Å from any heavy atom of the nearby monomer in the thermosome structure. for each protein family, the table indicates the number and percentage  of positions conserved among: all  <dig> intra-ring contact positions ; seventeen intra-ring contact-positions conserved among human cct monomers ; all  <dig> inter-ring contact positions, none of which were conserved among cct monomers . 2global indicates the range of similarities  of each sequence to human cct-subunit proteins within all aligned positions.

conservation of atp-binding and hydrolysis residues in bbs and cct8l proteins
we compared conservation in cct, bbs and cct8l sequences of the atp-binding and atp-hydrolysis motifs typical of chaperonins of group ii . although there is considerable variation among bbs and cct8l sequences at some of the atp-binding positions, we observed complete conservation of the crucial atp-binding dipeptide gly-pro, suggesting that these otherwise divergent proteins conserve atp-binding ability. in the atp-hydrolysis sites, substantial loss of conservation has been reported in mkks  <cit>  and in bbs <dig>  <cit> . in the cct8l, mkks and bbs <dig> families, unusual substitutions are observed in phosphate-binding positions and within the catalytic triad, where only asp is conserved in mkks. the effect that these mutations may have on the hydrolytic activity in these protein families is unclear. the high level of differentiation of this region in bbs <dig>  strongly suggests that bbs <dig> has lost hydrolytic activity.

conservation of substrate-binding positions
three positions crucial in determining substrate-specificity of cct monomers have been identified in the distal region of helix i in the apical domain  <cit> . we analyzed conservation at these positions across vertebrate species in all group ii chaperonin families and in the fab1_tcp domain across vertebrate orthologs of the pikfyve protein kinase . these positions are strikingly conserved within each cct monomer type  across species and are characteristically different between monomer types. they are mostly conserved also in the fab1_tcp domain across vertebrate sequences. in contrast, in bbs and, particularly, in cct8l sequences, the homologous positions are significantly more differentiated.

discussion
we identified the full complement of chaperonin hsp <dig> genes and pseudogenes encoded in the human genome and, for comparison, in the genomes of the model organisms mouse and rat. we delimited the set of hsp <dig> genes encoded in the human genome to: a) nine canonical cct genes  involved in formation of the cct complex; b) the cpn <dig> gene  of mitochondrial origin; c) the three highly diverged hsp60-like bbs genes mkks, bbs <dig> and bbs12; and d) a newly characterized class of genes, cct8l, represented in human by cct8l <dig> and cct8l <dig>  we also identified a plethora of pseudogene sequences, many of which had not been previously reported. the comparative analyses of these families of functional genes and of their pseudogenes revealed their evolutionary history and relationships.

in contrast to the uncertainty of the duplication pattern of canonical cct subunits  the origin of hsp60-like bbs and cct8l proteins was unambiguously identified by phylogenetic tree reconstructions. our analyses indicated that hsp60-like bbs genes originated monophyletically from a gene duplication event in the cct <dig> gene lineage. in addition, we determined that the cct8l family also originated in the cct <dig> lineage, from a more recent retrotransposition event. the presence of this gene family in placental mammals, marsupials and monotremes but not in reptiles/birds or other vertebrate species, indicates that this family originated at the onset of mammal evolution, before divergence of theria and prototheria. presence of two highly similar cct8l genes  in the genomes of human and chimp and of a single copy in other mammal genomes, including rhesus monkey, suggests that the duplication of this gene occurred in the ape lineage  after its divergence from the old-world monkeys . multiple evidence gathered in this work indicates that cct8l sequences  encode for functional genes:  reduced rates of non-synonymous mutation were estimated along their lineages, as expected for functionally-constrained protein-coding genes;  pseudogenes as ancient or more recent than the cct8l genes were heavily degenerated and no pseudogenes pre-dating mammal evolution could be identified. in contrast, although cct8l sequences originated early in mammal evolution, they did not show signs of degeneration ;  multiple est and microarray data have been collected for cct8l <dig>  mostly from testis, and one est for cct8l <dig> has been reported from placental tissue . these features taken together are strong evidence that at least cct8l <dig> in hominoidea and the lone cct8l gene in other mammal lineages encode for functional proteins. the sparse expression of cct8l <dig> in human and the presence of one in-frame stop codon and one frame-shift in its orthologous sequence from chimp raise doubts about the functionality of this sequence.

numerous sequences associated with cct or cpn <dig> genes found in the human, mouse or rat genomes were classified as pseudogenes based on the presence of internal stop codons, frame-shifts and non-significant difference in synonymous and non-synonymous mutation rates. among them, the sequences hspd1-5p and hspd1-6p appear to be expressed based on est analysis  and may represent instances of expressed pseudogenes  <cit> . a general explosion of pseudogene generation in the human and murid lineages after they separated from the carnivore lineage has been reported  <cit> . our analysis of chaperonin pseudogenes is consistent with this observation, although their relatively high rate of degeneration suggests that pseudogenes generated before the origin of mammals may have degraded beyond recognition. the intense duplication of chaperonin sequences witnessed by the many pseudogenes identified in the human and murid genomes, very likely provided opportunities for multiple paralogy, resulting in the proliferation of chaperonin classes in the vertebrate and mammal lineages.

although the hsp60-like bbs and cct8l protein families have considerably differentiated from the canonical cct subunits and within themselves, our analyses indicated that they still conserve the overall three-domain structure typical of cct proteins. structure and sequence variations predicted for their apical domains may reflect distinctive substrate specificities. in particular, lack of conservation at positions crucial in providing substrate-specificity to cct monomers  <cit>  suggests that bbs and cct8l proteins may interact with their substrate in different regions as compared with the canonical cct subunits. sequence differentiation patterns and acquisition of inserted elements in correspondence to potential monomer-monomer contact regions suggested that bbs and cct8l proteins do not assemble in a cct-like complex. this prediction is supported by experimental evidence showing that mkks localizes as a free monomer at the pericentriolar material of centrosomes  <cit> . in this respect, it is also interesting to observe that among bbs and cct8l sequences the atp-hydrolysis motif "gly-asp-gly-thr", remarkably conserved among canonical chaperonins  <cit> , has differentiated in mkks and in bbs <dig>  <cit> . this condition may indicate that these families have lost the hydrolytic activity necessary for the functionality of the chaperonin complex  <cit> . it has been shown for the archaeal thermosome complex that mutation of the atp-hydrolysis-motif asp residue prevents hydrolysis and productive protein folding  <cit>  and that some cct subunits, among which cct <dig>  dissociate in vitro from the complex in conditions that prevent hydrolysis of atp  <cit> .

functionalities independent from formation of the complex have also been reported for canonical cct subunits. tcp <dig> monomers not in complex confer enhanced salt tolerance in plants  <cit> . individual cct subunits have been reported to associate in vitro with cytoskeleton structures, selectively binding to microtubule filaments  <cit>  or to actin polymerizing filaments  <cit> . the localization of hsp60-like bbs proteins at the cilium basal body and at the centrosome  <cit>  suggests that they may also interact and associate with, for example, cytoskeleton structures in promoting the correct development of cilia  <cit> . the multiple structural and experimental evidence that bbs and cct8l proteins do not form a canonical cct-like complex provides strong indication that eukaryotic group ii chaperonin-protein functionalities extend beyond those of the typical oligomeric complex.

CONCLUSIONS
chaperonin proteins are key players in ensuring and preserving cell and organism functionality under normal and stressful conditions and their biological and medical importance is undeniable. the recent discovery of hsp <dig> genes directly implicated in specific pathological conditions, the chaperonopathies, extends our understanding of the roles of chaperonin proteins in cellular processes and enhances awareness of their importance in pathology  <cit> . here, we have provided a comprehensive, unifying framework encompassing all members of the extended hsp <dig> family of genes and pseudogenes. this unifying framework contributes to our understanding of the evolutionary history of the extended hsp <dig> family and widens our perspectives on the multiple roles that chaperonin proteins have acquired in vertebrates. our findings highlight how differentiation of the chaperonin protein family in mammals has been facilitated by intense processes of gene duplication. the roles, mechanisms of action, and involvement in pathogenesis of individual chaperonin molecules beyond those typical of their canonical oligomeric complexes constitute aspects of chaperonin physiology particularly promising for future experimental testing.
