BACKGROUND
for the better part of a century, guppies  have served as a model organism for the study of male coloration, courtship displays, female mate-choice, and visual-pigment evolution  <cit> . within these, and in other aspects of guppy life-history, a large number of sex- and population-specific morphological and behavioral characteristics have been described  <cit> , with the most salient of this variation being guppies' pronounced sexual dimorphism. for example, the cumaná guppy studied here, from a human perspective, exhibits polymorphic black, red, orange, yellow, and iridescent color patterns in males, while females are green, yellow, and iridescent. in areas of low-predation, such as that of cumaná guppies, male coloration increases and serves as an indicator of fitness to females, while under high predation pressure this coloration is subdued  <cit> . thus, conspicuous male coloration is a trade-off as it attracts both females and predators  <cit> . these observations suggest that color vision, at least in females, plays an important role in mate choice and, therefore, in the evolution of variation in male coloration.

vision is mediated by membrane-bound photoreceptors encoded by opsin genes. the opsin family has been broadly sorted into three subfamilies: photoisomerases, rhabdomeric opsins , and ciliary opsins  . although r-opsins are used for vision in protostomes the term 'visual opsin' has been used to describe the c-opsins expressed in vertebrate rods and cones. visual opsins have been categorized into five spectral classes: lws, sws <dig>  sws <dig>  rh <dig>  and rh <dig>  <cit> . the first four of these opsin classes facilitate cone-based photopic  vision and color perception, while rh <dig>  the most recently evolved of the five spectral classes  <cit> , facilitates rod-based scotopic  vision. visual-opsin gene loss and duplication and divergence have generated extensive repertoire variation among vertebrates that, in many cases, correlates to spectral environment .

remarkably, the cumaná guppy genome encodes at least  <dig> visual opsins. this repertoire includes one rh <dig> gene, three short wavelength-sensitive genes , two middle wavelength-sensitive genes , and four long wavelength-sensitive  genes: a <dig>  p <dig>  s <dig>  and s180r. the eleventh gene is a hybrid locus  that has not been detected in other guppy populations  <cit> . the observation that amino acid substitutions have occurred at key sites, even among recent duplicates   <cit>  suggests that much, if not all, of this diversity is a product of selection.

long before the guppy opsin gene repertoire was characterized, microspectrophotometry  data indicated that guppies had several distinct classes of retinal photoreceptor cells . these include ultraviolet , short- and middle-wavelength sensitive cones with maximal absorption  at 359/ <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nm, respectively, as well as one or more of three lws cones with λmax values clustering at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nm. rod λmax was also characterized at about  <dig> nm  <cit> . collectively, these findings implicate photoreceptor-level expression of at least six of the  <dig> visual-opsin genes found in guppies, though it has not been possible, until now, to associate each λmax to a specific opsin and photoreceptor morphology .

in several fish species a large visual-opsin gene repertoire appears to play an important role in the tuning of vision for particular environments . while these examples of vision tuning deal with wavelength sensitivity, evidence of increased color discrimination by means of an expanded opsin gene repertoire has recently been shown in non-teleost species. transgenic mice expressing three instead of two lws opsins exhibited enhanced discrimination of red and orange wavelengths of light  <cit> . similarly, mancuso et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that it was possible to treat adult squirrel monkey  congenital red-green color blindness using lws-recombinant adeno-associated virus  gene therapy. the intriguing implication of these studies is that retinal circuitry and higher order neuronal processes are either sufficient or adapt to mediate this augmentation to congenital vision. thus, the potential for guppies to have increased color sensitivity and/or discrimination seemingly hinges on if, and to what extent, these 'extra opsins' are expressed in the retina.

although all  <dig> non-hybrid visual opsins are expressed at the mrna level in cumaná guppy eyes  <cit> , little is known about the relative abundance of each opsin. ward et al.  <cit>  indicated that lws expression is predominated  by a <dig> transcripts; however, only three adult fish were surveyed. here we used reverse transcription quantitative pcr  to characterize expression levels of all non-hybrid visual opsins. we surveyed males, females, and juveniles in order to test the hypothesis that sexual selection influences color vision in guppies. as adults, males exhibit elaborate red, orange, and yellow colorations that strongly influence female mate choice  <cit> . since embryos and juveniles do not show these characteristic colors, and by definition are not sexually active, we predicted that if opsin gene expression plays a role in color-based sexual selection, then lws upregulation will coincide with sexual maturity. finally, the recent discovery that sws <dig> and lws occur in a tandem array in cumaná guppies  <cit>  allowed us to test the hypothesis that distance from a candidate lcr influences opsin expression in guppies, as is the case for human lws/mws  <cit>  and zebrafish  rh2s  <cit> .

methods
animal care and treatment
care and treatment of guppies were in compliance with the canadian council of animal care and approved by the university of victoria animal care committee. guppies from our inbred lab population  were housed in  <dig> gallon aquaria  under a synthetic 14: <dig> hour light-dark cycle with instantaneous transition between photoperiods. illumination was provided by fluorescent bulbs . relative irradiance of the spectral environment was measured by a usb <dig> spectrophotometer  at the air to water boundary . aquaria were maintained at  <dig> ± 1°c on a fresh water flow-through system at the university of victoria aquatic research facility. fish were fed brine shrimp  flake  daily between 10:00-11: <dig> hours of the light phase. the number, sex, and age of guppies at time of sampling are detailed in table  <dig>

note both 1- and 2-month-old juveniles are generally sexually indistinguishable ; for brevity, the designations 'male' and 'female' are only assigned to adults in this study. males and females were exposed to each other . male and female guppy numbers  identify different groups.

extraction of total rna and cdna synthesis
following light-dark cycle adaptation period  guppies were euthanized in  <dig> g/l tricaine methanesulphonate, ms <dig>   at 13: <dig> hours of the light phase. sampling time was based on cichlid and zebrafish studies indicating that the highest level of cone opsin expression coincides with the end of the photopic day  <cit> . eyes from  <dig> individuals were excised and pooled according to age, sex, and left or right eyes , with each pool individually placed into  <dig>  ml purezol™  containing a  <dig> mm tungsten carbide bead. extraction of left and right eyes were alternated among individuals to eliminate rna degradation bias that might have occurred between specimen death and eye immersion in purezol™ . to assess variability between broods of the same age, one-month-old juveniles from two females were sampled . four additional groups of five individuals, for each sex, had both eyes pooled to expand the a <dig> and s <dig> expression dataset .

eyes immersed in purzol™ solution , were homogenize in a retsch® mm <dig> mixer mill at  <dig> hz for  <dig> minutes. total rna was extracted using the aurum™ total rna fatty and fibrous tissue , which included a  <dig> minute dnase i incubation. concentration and purity  of total rna was measured using a nd- <dig> spectrophotometer  . iscript™ cdna synthesis kits , which incorporates random hexameric and oligo-dt primers to yield a cdna representation of total rna at time of sampling, were used to generate single-stranded cdna from  <dig> ng total rna per  <dig> μl reaction. this yielded total cdna concentrations of  <dig> ng/μl for each sample, assuming close to 100% conversion. cdna samples were diluted 50-fold for subsequent rt-qpcr and 10-fold for subsequent reverse transcription pcr  assays; all cdna was stored at -20°c.

primer design
locus-specific primers flanking  at least one intron were designed for opsin and reference genes from alignments of fish sequences . primers were synthesized by either operon® biotechnologies or integrated dna technologies® and stored in sterile dh2o at -20°c . rt-pcr, using opsin and reference gene primers, was carried out on 10-fold diluted cdna samples. in each case a single band of the desired size  was detected and gene identity confirmed via sequencing at the centre for biomedical research  dna sequencing facility at the university of victoria. due to the high sequence similarity among lws, primer specificity was confirmed by cross-amplification reactions  before commencing rt-qpcr.

development of plasmid standards
preliminary qpcr assays, using the methods described below, revealed amplification efficiencies  - 1) of several opsins to be significantly different from one another  , indicating that relative quantification among opsins would not be acceptable. therefore, effs were determined by standard curves run in parallel with cdna samples for each gene during rt-qpcr . to make these plasmid standards, rt-pcr products were generated using opsin- and reference-gene specific primers , with subsequent amplicons purified using qiaquick® pcr purification kit, a-tailed with native taq polymerase , and cloned using the pgem®-t easy vector system ii kit . verification of clone insert size was determined by plasmid-pcr, using sp <dig> and t <dig> multi-cloning site  primers  , followed by sequencing . plasmids  were serial diluted to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> copies per  <dig>  μl reaction for generation of standard curves by rt-qpcr .

real-time rt-qpcr
quantification of visual-opsin and reference gene transcript copy number for the  <dig> guppy-eye cdna samples  was determined by rt-qpcr analysis carried out in a stratagene® mx4000® multiplex quantitative pcr machine using gene specific primers . each  <dig>  μl reaction was run in triplicate and consisted of:  <dig>  mm tris base,  <dig>  mm tris-hcl,  <dig> mm kcl,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> % tween- <dig>   <dig> % glycerol,  <dig> % sybr green i ,  <dig> μm dntps,  <dig> nm of each primer,  <dig>  u platinum taq ,  <dig> μl of 50-fold diluted cdna, and  <dig>  nm rox passive reference dye  used to normalize the fluorescent reporter signal between reactions. rt-qpcr conditions consisted of  <dig> cycle at 95°c ;  <dig> cycles of 95°c , 60°c , 72°c ;  <dig> cycle of 95°c ; followed by a 41-step melting-curve analysis . cycle threshold  values, based upon the normalized change in fluorescence , for each locus were compared to a corresponding standard curve run in parallel to determine transcript copy number. these values were then normalized to the transcript copy number  of the three reference genes  . see additional file  <dig> for justification of reference gene use. dissociation curves ] over t°c) and agarose gel electrophoresis were used to confirm the presence of single amplicons.

data shown are from triplicate rt-qpcr reactions run in parallel with guppy cdna samples, and were used to determine opsin- or reference-gene transcript copy number.

RESULTS
guppies express all  <dig> non-hybrid visual opsins in the eye at varying levels depending on age and sex . in juveniles, two genes  accounted for >85% of visual opsin transcripts in the eye, excluding rh <dig> . in adults, the relative abundance  of sws2b and rh2- <dig> transcripts decreased to about 65%, apparently making room for the increase in a <dig> transcripts from approximately 3% to 20%, while the juvenile-to-female transition showed s <dig> upregulation from about  <dig> % to 7% . in all samples, a <dig> was the predominant lws expressed . data from our secondary survey showed a statistically significant  increase in female s <dig> expression and a small but statistically significant  increase in female a <dig> expression relative to males  . we also detected a small amount of variation  between left and right eye expression ; however, no significant difference  was seen between left and right eye expression overall . mean expression across cdna samples for each opsin gene within the sws2-lws cluster was higher for genes closest to the candidate lcr, while s180r, unlinked to the other lws  <cit> , showed the least expression.

discussion
the recent discovery that cumaná guppies  express  <dig> of their  <dig> visual-opsin genes in adult eyes  <cit> , suggested that this species possesses enhanced wavelength sensitivity and/or discrimination. characterization of this repertoire was particularly exciting given the wealth of data on color-based sexual selection in this species. however, rt-qpcr data reported here indicates that the guppy eye might not be the irradiance detector we had initially envisioned.

two to four visual opsins predominate in guppy eyes
our rt-qpcr analysis of cumaná guppy eyes revealed that all  <dig> non-hybrid visual-opsin genes are expressed in juveniles and adults  . curiously, only two opsin genes in juveniles , three in males , and four in females , produced the majority of visual opsin transcripts in the eye, excluding rh <dig> . at first, these surprising results suggest that juveniles, males, and females are at least dichromatic, trichromatic, and tetrachromatic, respectively. however, any extrapolations from opsin expression to color vision require data on the location of opsins in the guppy retina, not just their quantity. to shed light on this, we compared our rt-qpcr data to msp data on guppy cone cells. this allowed us to assign visual opsins to λmax peaks. as λmax peaks are known for specific cone types, and for specific regions of the retina, we were able to assign opsins to different cone types and areas of the retina.

guppy visual-opsin expression in rods and cones
in this section, we first explore previous opsin-to-λmax assignments and then show how our rt-qpcr data fills the gaps in these assignments. msp studies on adult guppy retinas demonstrated the presence of: rods with a λmax at about  <dig> nm, ultraviolet-sensitive  cones, violet-sensitive  cones, blue-sensitive  cones, and a series of green- to yellow-sensitive cones with λmax values clustering at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nm  <cit> . inter-specific opsin comparison indicated that these photoreceptors express rh <dig>  sws <dig>  sws2b, rh <dig>  and both rh <dig> and lws opsins, respectively   <cit> . hofmann and carleton  <cit>  attributed the  <dig> nm peak to sws2b and not to sws2a, which is consistent with sws2b generally exhibiting a lower λmax than sws2a in teleosts . however, it was unclear which rh <dig>  was responsible for the  <dig> or  <dig> nm peaks . now, with our rt-qpcr data, this assignment ambiguity can be clarified, finally enabling visual opsins to be assigned to photoreceptor types.

sws <dig> and rh <dig> assignments
our expression data led us to assign the  <dig> and  <dig> nm peaks to sws2b and rh2- <dig>  respectively. this was due to sws2b and rh2- <dig> transcripts exhibiting a combined ra of >65% among all guppies assayed, whereas sws2a and rh2- <dig> transcripts showed ~5% ra . it is, therefore, likely  that the above msp studies detected more of the highly expressed pigments than their less expressed counterparts. these data, combined with the observation that msp consistently found 464- <dig> nm peaks for accessory double-cones  in multiple populations , led us to attribute the majority of rh <dig> and sws <dig> expression in juvenile and adult guppy eyes to rh2- <dig> in accessory dcs and sws2b in dorsal long single-cones  . this conclusion, as well as others made below, is contingent on opsin-class expression in photoreceptor types being similar between our venezuelan population  and that of the above msp studies done on trinidadian populations . this is probable given that the λmax values for photoreceptors types are consistent among all populations sampled to date, with variation limited to the long wavelength-sensitive region .

at this point, it is important to note that, although dorsal-ventral differences in opsin expression have not been investigated in cumaná guppies, dorsal-ventral differences in cone pigment distribution  were found in another population via msp  <cit> . furthermore, msp data showing that accessory dcs invariably contain  <dig> nm pigments   <cit> , combined with morphological studies  showing that the ventral retina is largely devoid of ellipsosomes , supports the above msp finding and our proposal that cumaná guppies exhibit similar dorsal-ventral expression. finally, the spectral selective-pressures thought to be responsible for this pattern  are present in cumaná guppy habitats.

lws assignments
variation in λmax of lws cones is present among adult guppy individuals in both trinidadian and venezuelan populations. for three trinidadian populations, one or more peak absorption  is exhibited   <cit> . however, as these data represent  <dig> individuals from each of the three populations  grouped together during analysis, it is unclear if variation in λmax is attributed to individual and/or population-level differences. although, individual variation was, indeed, observed for the paria population in an earlier study  <cit> . similarly, for venezuelan guppies, recent msp data indicate that individuals of at least one population  also contain one or more of three lws cones. these cones have λmax values of about  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nm, with four out of the seven individuals assayed containing only  <dig> nm cones  <cit> . given this, and that we report data from only our highly inbred cumaná lab-population, it stands to reason that we should see limited variability in lws opsin expression - a hypothesis that is supported by a <dig> transcripts clearly predominating in our lab population , as was indicated in preliminary work  <cit> .

previously, guppy a180-to-λmax assignments have been based on values from other species  <cit>  and on the - <dig> nm shift attributed to the s180a substitution  <cit> . these data led ward et al.  <cit>  to assign a180's λmax to  <dig> nm. however, with both a <dig> transcription and  <dig> nm lws cones predominating in cumaná guppies, we can now attribute these cones to a <dig> expression. further support for this assignment comes from a relative of the guppy, the green swordtail , that expresses p <dig>  s <dig>  and s180r, but lacks a <dig>  <cit> . the fact that this species does not exhibit an absorption peak near  <dig> nm  <cit>  supports our assignment of a <dig> being responsible for the 540/ <dig> nm peak found in guppies. within a cone mosaic unit, lws ventral twin-dcs and ventral lcs have been shown to have the same λmax values, indicating expression of the same pigment   <cit> . in light of these data, the principle member of dcs, lws ventral twin-dcs , and ventral lcs, all appear to express a <dig> in cumaná guppies .

msp showed no significant difference between male and female λmax frequencies for lws cones among guppies from the three different trinidadian populations mentioned above  <cit> . although our venezuelan population showed a significant difference between male and female a <dig> expression, ~15% versus 20% ra, respectively , this difference might not have been recognized by msp or may not be present in trinidadian populations. we also detected a significant increase in female s <dig> expression in our population . trinidadian populations exhibit relatively few  <dig> nm peaks  <cit> , which we assign to s <dig> , indicating that s <dig> expression appears to differ among populations.

s <dig> and s180r - the most red-shifted lws opsins in guppies - were once both predicted to have λmax values of approximately  <dig> nm  <cit> . however, the spectral-tuning effects of the amino acid differences between these two opsins have not been determined  <cit> . since female cumaná guppies express  <dig> times more s <dig> transcripts than that of s180r , and that  <dig> nm cones are the only cones more red-shifted than a <dig> cones in this population  <cit> , we attribute these  <dig> nm cones to s <dig> expression. this assignment is consistent with the two s <dig>  opsins found in medaka  having a λmax of  <dig> and  <dig> nm  <cit> .

trinidadian guppy populations exhibit lws cones with λmax values at about  <dig> nm  <cit> . given s180r's low transcription and lack of  <dig> nm cones in our venezuelan guppy population, as well as s180r's amino acid differences from s <dig>  we attribute the  <dig> nm cones in trinidadian populations to s180r expression. this assignment is consistent with at least one of bluefin killifish's  two lws opsins being s180r  <cit> , as both lws-a and lws-b seem to absorb at  <dig> nm  <cit> . green swordtail also exhibits a similar peak , though this is thought to be due to s <dig> subtypes   <cit> ; however, since quantitative expression data is currently unavailable for this species, s180r can not be ruled out.

the above opsin-to-λmax assignments for a <dig>  s <dig>  and s180r are also consistent with the predicted λmax of p <dig> being the most blue-shifted lws opsin at  <dig> nm . since rods are the only retinal photoreceptor near p180's predicted λmax  for both trinidadian and venezuelan guppy populations , and that we detected <1% ra for p <dig>  it seems that if visual relevancy is exhibited at this expression level in cumaná guppies, then it may be due to a small number of p <dig> cones missed by msp scans or, more likely, coexpression with another opsin that may serve to broaden the spectral absorption range of the cell.

given our p <dig>  a <dig>  s <dig>  and s180r λmax assignments of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nm, respectively, which lws opsin is responsible for the ~525- <dig> nm peak found in multiple guppy populations  <cit> ? hofmann and carleton  <cit>  dissented from the previously held notion that the ~ <dig> nm peak was attributed to a lws opsin. instead, they assigned the ~ <dig> nm peak to the rh <dig> opsin class, which is consistent with other teleost rh2s absorbing in this range  <cit> . however, it has not yet been discerned whether this peak is due to rh2- <dig> or rh2- <dig>  given rh2-1's low expression, relative to rh2- <dig> , and the rarity of  <dig> nm cones among cumaná guppies  <cit> , it appears that rh2- <dig> is a strong candidate for explaining the 525- <dig> nm peaks found in principle dcs among various populations. this assignment is also consistent with rh2- <dig> absorbing at  <dig> nm in bluefin killifish  <cit> .

sws <dig> assignments
archer and lythgoe  <cit>  were the first to detect the presence of uv-sensitive single cones with a λmax at  <dig> nm in guppies. endler et al.  <cit>  later reported  cones with a λmax at  <dig> nm, while recent work by watson et al.  <cit>  showed identical results. in retrospect, it is understandable that archer and colleague's early msp studies  <cit> , as well as others preceding it , might have had difficulties detecting uv-sensitive cones due to the scanning range of their measuring beam . this appears to account for the lack of short corner-cones  described in previous msp studies . indeed, ultra-structure studies on adult guppy retinas have shown scs across the whole retina , excluding a thin peripheral zone and most of the ventral retina , which in teleosts generally contain sws <dig>  <cit> . based on these data, we assign the  <dig> nm peak to sws <dig> expression in scs, which is consistent with sws1-to-λmax assignments in other teleosts .

with the above assignment, it is curious that our sws <dig> expression data among all guppies examined is relatively low  given the apparent quantity of scs in the retina . this observation may be explained, in part, by ultra-structural analysis that showed a decrease in ventral scs relative to that of the dorsal retina  . furthermore, the spectral conditions  of our population and/or age at sampling might have contributed to these low expression levels. such minimal sws <dig> expression is not unique, as comparable levels are seen in zebrafish juveniles and adults  <cit> , as well as adult medaka  <cit> , while rainbow trout  experience more than a 20-fold decrease in sws <dig> expression during development from parr to smolt  <cit> .

rh <dig> assignments
rh <dig> expression, located in rods   <cit> , fluctuated among guppy ages without a clear pattern emerging, with overall expression being relatively low compared to cone opsins . this was not expected since adult guppies have an increased number of rods relative to juveniles , which should be reflected by rh <dig> upregulation in adults. similar to the sws <dig> expression pattern discussed above, the spectral environment of our population might have affected rh <dig> expression. although the guppies used in this study were on a synthetic light-dark cycle, the lab population from which they were originally sampled experienced 24-hour artificial light conditions  since it was established six years prior to the present study. additionally, guppy rods are known to move sclerally under photopic conditions  <cit> . this movement increases absorption and recycling of the rod disks by the adjacent retinal pigment epithelium   <cit> . furthermore, in the cichlid, haplochromis burtoni, rh <dig> expression peaks near the beginning of the light cycle  <cit> , while cone opsins are maximally expressed towards the end of the light cycle  <cit> . with these factors in mind, it appears that low rh <dig> expression in guppies reflects both sampling time and artificial light conditions.

opsin spatial expression
guppy cone cells are organized into a square mosaic across the retina . thus, dorsal- and ventral-mediated vision is probably comparable to central vision with respect to visual acuity; putting equal importance on dorsal-ventral differences in opsin expression with respect to spectral sensitivity and/or discrimination. msp data indicate that the majority of twin dcs and lcs in the ventral retina of guppies express lws pigments . in other fish, dorsal-ventral differences in expression are also seen. zebrafish, for example, express shorter wavelength-sensitive rh2- <dig>  rh2- <dig>  and lws- <dig> in the dorsal retina, while expressing their longer wavelength-sensitive counterparts  in the ventral retina  <cit> . this expression of longer wavelength-sensitive opsins in the ventral retina of diurnal shallow-water species appears to be, at least partially, a result of the transmission properties of the water  <cit> .

guppies are a tropical, freshwater, surface dwelling species native to trinidad and venezuela  <cit> , and are found in clear to tea colored water  <cit> . the majority of these freshwater environments contain dissolved/suspended organic material that tends to absorb short-wavelength light, resulting in increased transmission of long-wavelengths through the water column . this appears to be reflected in the lws-dominant ventral retina of the guppy, which at increasing depths seems tuned to the most abundant downwelling light , thereby maximizing contrast of objects above    <cit> . however, this adaptation may be at the cost of color discrimination, due to a single cone class  predominating in this region  <cit> . conversely, the dorsal-central retina seems well suited for color discrimination given the presence of at least three different cones pigments  <cit> , where we propose that spectrally diverse opsins  predominate . this opsin expression pattern would be fitting since males perform courtship displays most often in front and sometimes slightly below females  <cit> .

opsin coexpression
complicating the interpretation of opsin expression and msp data is the potential for coexpression of two or more visual opsins in a cone cell. this might explain the low expression of some of the opsin genes detected in our guppy population. coexpression may serve to expand the absorption range of guppy cones, as this appears to be the case for the siberian hamster  <cit> . recently, rainbow trout have been shown to coexpress rh <dig> duplicates during the parr-to-smolt transition, yielding a cone with a broader absorption range than other classes  <cit> . however, coexpression is likely to diminish photoreceptor sensitivity to a specific wavelength if total opsin expression in that cell is constant.

individual opsin expression
low-abundance opsins may play a key role in guppy vision even if their transcript levels are a consequence of expression in relatively few cones cells. for example, humans have approximately  <dig> million rods and about  <dig>  million cones per eye  <cit> . thus, about five percent of photoreceptors are responsible for generating color vision, while only 5- <dig> percent of this population is comprised of sws cones . despite this relatively small quantity of sws cones, humans can readily detect short wavelengths of light, and when sws is not functional or absent  the effect on color discrimination is often dramatic . with this in mind, one should not discount the potential role of even a small population of guppy cone cells. alternatively, it is possible that one or more of the opsin genes with low-abundance transcription are upregulated at a time not represented in this study .

lws upregulation in adult guppies
in the previous section we formed a model of opsin expression in the guppy cone mosaic that is consistent with the selective pressures of environmental spectra and sexual selection. with this in mind, we now seek to identify the evolutionary forces that have led to this species' lws expression pattern.

an important finding of this study is the marked upregulation of a <dig> from near 3% ra in juveniles to about 20% ra in adults . these data may have far-reaching implications, as it supports our hypothesis that if opsin gene duplication and divergence plays a role in sexual selection then we expect to see lws upregulation coinciding with sexual maturity . this result thereby implicates a <dig> in conferring adult guppies with increased spectral sensitivity and/or discrimination. however, the selective pressures that may have led to, and/or maintained, this upregulation appear to differ between sexes.

for males, we propose that a <dig> upregulation enhances detection of foods with greater quantities of carotenoids. this ability would increase conspicuousness , as guppies do not synthesize carotenoid pigments de novo; instead, the acquisition and subsequent modification of such pigments starts with ingestion of carotenoids found in the fruit and algal component of their diet  <cit> . being able to better detect food would increase overall fitness, while acquisition of foods with greater amounts of carotenoids would increase the color saturation of orange spots  <cit> , which is an indicator of foraging ability  <cit>  and immunocompetence  <cit> . in turn, reproductive fitness levels would rise since females from many populations show a preference for males with greater orange spot area and color saturation  <cit> . together, these factors are strong candidates for selective forces driving a <dig> upregulation in male guppies.

for females, we propose that increased a <dig> expression would allow for enhanced spectral discrimination of male spot coloration - long known to be an integral trait assessed by females in a prospective mate  <cit>  - or provide improved detection and evaluation of male sigmoid displays. the latter of which was proposed by ward et al.  <cit>  regarding non-specific lws upregulation. interestingly, the juvenile-to-female transition also showed upregulation of s <dig> from about  <dig> % to 7% ra , which further supports our hypothesis of lws upregulation at sexual maturity, suggesting that increased s <dig> may also enhance discrimination of male coloration or courtship displays. furthermore, our secondary survey detected small but statistically significant a <dig> upregulation in females relative to males , which may also augment spectral discrimination of male coloration. importantly, these data are consistent with laboratory and wild guppy disk-pecking experiments that showed both sexes are attracted to orange colors, while females exhibited a greater interest for orange and males for yellow  <cit> , which may reflect female upregulation of s <dig> and/or the small upregulation  of a <dig> detected in the present study. additionally, it is possible that females also benefit from consumption of carotenoid-rich food, as guppy egg carotenoid levels positively correlate with dietary intake; although, offspring quality does not appear to be affected  <cit> . intriguingly, the only other known taxa with sex-specific differences in opsin gene expression are the lycaenid butterflies, where color-based sexual selection has also been demonstrated  <cit> .

for both male and female guppies, it has been proposed that increased expression of spectrally distinct opsins can aide in motion detection  <cit> , which may heighten male  detection or predator avoidance. however, if the increased expression and number of lws opsins seen in adults confers an adaptive advantage with respect to predation, then one would expect upregulation of these genes to be selected for at earlier developmental stages . this indicates that upregulation of a <dig> and s <dig> confers an adaptive advantage to events that occur later on in life, such as rival male detection, food acquisition, or mate choice. it is, therefore, fitting that disk pecking experiments also showed a lack of juvenile preference between orange and red colors, which may reflect an inability to discriminate between the two, while adults were able to make this distinction  <cit> . this suggests that adults have increased discrimination of long wavelengths of light - an ability usually afforded by additional spectrally-distinct lws opsins  <cit> , which we propose is a function of the a <dig> and s <dig> upregulation only observed in adults. furthermore, no differences in color preference were detected between guppies from high- versus low-predation populations  <cit> , indicating that color discrimination is not linked to predation.

our above proposal is also consistent with rodd et al.'s  <cit>  work, which indicates that female guppies' preference for male orange-coloration has developed as a product of a sensory bias for orange-colored objects, such as carotenoid-rich fruits. thus, the high expression of a <dig> in males and their ability to discriminate longer wavelengths of light is not surprising, as it probably was beneficial for both sexes to be able to detect fruit before female's preference for male coloration emerged.

effects of lcr proximity on opsin gene expression in guppy eyes
recently, the genomic organization of sws <dig> and lws were reported for guppies  <cit>  and a close relative, the green swordtail   <cit> . this organization consists of a tandem array where sws <dig> is located upstream of a candidate lcr with lws following downstream . this pattern is also found in medaka, zebrafish, stickleback, fugu , tetraodon , and in monotremes   <cit> . of these species, those with more than two opsins in the array are shown in figure 4a.

for guppies, watson et al.  <cit>  hypothesized that if a <dig> is located closest to the putative lcr then this may explain its relatively high expression among lws, as distance from a lcr has been shown to negatively correlate with opsin expression . now that the genomic location of these genes are known for guppy, we expand on this hypothesis in that both sws2b and a <dig> should be the most highly expressed genes in the sws2-lws gene cluster if distance to the lcr negatively correlates with expression. our results indicate that this might be the case, with sws2b and a <dig> exhibiting predominant expression in this gene cluster . zebrafish also exhibit highest expression of their most proximal lws   <cit> , while both lws- <dig> and lws- <dig> exhibit different spatial expression  <cit> . however, medaka deviate from this pattern with sws2a expression exceeding sws2b , while expression data for its two lws  are unknown since primers that can distinguish between the two were not used  <cit> . currently, quantitative expression data for x. helleri opsins are also unknown.

if the above upregulation is solely a consequence of proximity to the lcr, then a <dig> levels should be consistent among populations since this genomic architecture would not likely vary. however, it is clear that among teleosts, locus distance to a lcr does not always negatively correlate with expression, implying that other cis- or trans-acting factors also regulate expression in this gene cluster, which may explain the differences in lws-cone maximal absorption among populations and individuals.

s180r genomic location and expression
both guppies and x. helleri possess a fourth lws  that lacks introns ii-v and is located in intron xi of gephyrin  , which suggests that s180r is a result of retrotransposition  <cit> . this is consistent with retrogenes typically inserting into areas of the genome unlinked to the progenitor gene . orthologs of s180r have also recently been identified in the one-sided livebearer  and the four-eyed fish   <cit> . furthermore, exon/intron i structure and length are highly conserved between guppy s180r and its progenitor gene, s <dig>  as is the case in x. helleri , indicating that s180r did not obtain its single intron post retrotransposition.

while the intron that survived retroduplication might bear enhancers that promote expression in the retina, it is also possible that the s180r transcripts we detected in guppy eyes were driven by gphn regulatory elements. however, since s180r is in the reverse orientation to gphn , gphn pre-mrna  could not additionally function as the coding strand for the s180r protein; although, the s180r non-coding region could be converted into cdna and amplified by rt-qpcr, yielding the appearance of low-level coding-transcripts where there may be none. nonetheless, transcription of s180r  in the eye may occur via other mechanisms . one such mechanism stems from gphn being present at inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid  synapses where it aids in the translocation and stabilization of gaba receptors to the postsynaptic membrane . thus, it would be highly expressed in guppy eyes since there are a myriad of gabaergic synapses present in the vertebrate retina  <cit> . gphn's high expression would probably be accompanied by an increasingly open chromatin structure where retrogenes are more accessible to transcriptional machinery  <cit> , while neighboring gphn enhancers may also facilitate s180r transcription.

CONCLUSIONS
our rt-qpcr analysis of visual-opsin gene expression in juvenile and adult guppies has enabled us to propose the first opsin-to-λmax assignments for all photoreceptors in the cone mosaic. where sws <dig>  is expressed in scs, sws2b  is expressed in lcs, rh2- <dig>  is expressed in the accessory member of dcs, and lws opsins  are expressed in the principle member of dcs, lws ventral twin-dcs, and ventral lcs. variation in λmax of lws cones among guppies appears to be a result of individual and/or population level differences, which likely explains the low-abundance lws transcripts detected in the present study. although our results indicate that cumaná guppy juveniles, males, and females are at least di-, tri-, and tetra-chromatic, respectively, it is important to keep in mind that opsin coexpression and differential spatial-temporal expression may enable low-abundance opsins to be visually relevant. in situ hybridization experiments will be carried out to test this hypothesis.

marked lws  upregulation in adults coincides with males donning orange and red spots, whose area and color saturation positively correlate with reproductive fitness and carotenoid-rich food ingestion. given this, and that behavioral studies suggest that adults may have greater discriminatory abilities at longer wavelengths light than juveniles, lws upregulation in adults is implicated in enhancing spectral discrimination of male coloration and carotenoid-rich foods, with the former seeming to have arisen from a sensory bias of the latter.

in the sws2-lws gene cluster, genes closest to the candidate lcr, sws2b and a <dig>  exhibited the highest expression. however, locus distance to a lcr does not always negatively correlate with expression in other teleosts, indicating that additional regulatory factors are present. this may account for the differences in lws-cone λmax among guppy populations and individuals.
