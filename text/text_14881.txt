BACKGROUND
the early activation marker cd <dig> is transiently expressed following ligation of the t cell receptor, providing direct access to an antigen-specific population following ex vivo stimulation  <cit> . whereas mhc tetramers define responses to immunodominant epitopes in subjects with the appropriate hla-dr haplotype, the cd <dig> method permits direct access to a larger group of responding t cells that can be simultaneously characterised by cytokine expression. we recently presented the first detailed description of cd154+ t cells after short-term birch allergen stimulation in non-allergic controls and birch pollinosis patients  <cit> . using this method, we showed that t cell responses to birch allergen in health are of mixed phenotype, but tightly maintained at a low th2: th <dig> ratio. by contrast, the relationship was dysregulated in birch pollinosis, with a higher th2: th <dig> ratio and abrogation of the il- <dig> response.

experiments using mhc class ii tetramer technology have described important differences between t cell responses to seasonal and perennial allergens. in particular, t cells specific for seasonal allergens have been reported as cd27low, late-differentiated cells  <cit> , whereas perennial allergen-specific t cell responses are cd27high, consistent with a central memory/early differentiated phenotype  <cit> . our previous study did demonstrate a significantly higher frequency of cd27- late-differentiated t cells responding to birch pollen in allergic individuals compared to non-atopic controls  <cit> . however, the difference was not striking, possibly because the birch extract antigen used in the system activates t cells that are specific for other pr- <dig> protein homologs found in plant derived foods.

the objectives of this research were  <cit>  to explore whether the relationship between th <dig> and th <dig> cells previously defined using birch allergen also hold for cat and grass allergens, and  <cit>  to investigate whether previously described differences between t cell responses to a seasonal  and perennial  allergen could be reproduced using the cd <dig> detection method.

RESULTS
the responder cell frequency differs according to the allergen and atopic status
a cd4+cd154+ t cell population was resolved in all study participants following cat and grass allergen stimulation . in additional experiments, pbmc were stimulated under the same conditions with  <dig>  ng/ml lps  or pbs: this did not induce cd <dig> t cell cd <dig> expression over background .

the cat allergen-induced cd154+ t cell response represented  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total cd <dig> t cell population in non-allergic and cat-allergic individuals, respectively. the difference did not reach statistical significance .

the frequency of cd154+ t cells responding to grass pollen allergen was lower compared to cat allergen, representing  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all cd <dig> t cells in non-allergic and grass-allergic individuals, respectively . grass-allergic individuals exhibited a significantly higher frequency of cd154+ t cells compared to non-allergic controls .

th <dig> and th <dig> responses to both allergens are mixed with substantial overlap, but the th2: th <dig> ratio separates allergic and non-allergic individuals
th <dig>  th <dig> and tr1-like cells were defined as cd154+ifnγ+, cd154+il-4+ and cd154+il-10+, respectively . with respect to both cat and grass allergens, we observed very mixed and variable t cell responses in both allergic and non-allergic subjects. in the case of grass allergen, th <dig> responses were convincingly greater than the non-allergic group , but the parameter separated the cat-allergic and cat-tolerant group less completely  . there were no differences in the frequency of th <dig> or tr1-like responses between allergic and non-allergic participants in response to either cat or grass allergens .

however, the th2: th <dig> ratio  achieved better separation of cat and grass-allergic participants from non-allergic subjects .

t cell responses to the control mitogen pha did not differ between allergic and non-allergic individuals .

a close correlation between th <dig>  th <dig> and tr1-like responses in healthy subjects is dysregulated in allergic individuals
to explore dependency between th <dig> responses to allergens and other parameters, we correlated th <dig> cell frequency with serological and immunological responses.

a close correlation was observed between th <dig> cell frequency and the absolute concentration of cat-specific ige .

cell frequency and ige levels in cat-allergic individuals.

amongst non-atopic participants, positive correlations were observed between the frequency of th <dig> cells and the th <dig> and tr1-like responses following pbmc stimulation with either cat or grass allergen , such that the expression of these cytokines increased together to maintain a low th2: th <dig> ratio.

amongst grass-allergic participants, there was no dependence between the frequency of th <dig>  th <dig> and tr1-like cells . in cat-allergic participants, positive correlations were noted between the frequency of th <dig> cells and the th <dig>  and the tr1-like  response, however at a lower significance compared to their non-allergic counterparts and at a higher th2: th <dig> ratio.

th <dig> responses to grass, but not cat allergen, have a late-differentiated phenotype
we investigated the phenotype of responding cd154+ and cd154+cytokine+ t cell populations following allergen stimulation using the expression of cell surface marker cd <dig>  subsets were defined as early-differentiated  or late-differentiated . t cell responses to cat allergen were predominantly early-differentiated cd27- cells, regardless of atopic status . in patients with grass pollinosis, the proportion of late-differentiated cd27- th <dig> cells was far higher in the allergic group compared to the non-allergic group ; there was a slight increase in the proportion of cd27- cells in the total  response, but no difference with respect to th <dig> responses.

subjects with asymptomatic sensitisation and those with allergic disease cannot be differentiated on the basis of the th2: th <dig> ratio
we also investigated the t cell response to allergens in a small group of individuals with asymptomatic sensitisation to birch, cat or grass allergen, defined as a positive skin prick test to the allergen but no clinical symptoms upon exposure to cats or during the relevant pollen season. following stimulation with the appropriate allergen, the th2: th <dig> ratio in sensitised individuals was similar to that of allergic subjects, demonstrating that this parameter does not discriminate between sensitisation and allergic disease .

discussion
cd <dig> expression has been demonstrated to identify an antigen-specific t cell population following short-term stimulation with pathogen-derived antigens  <cit> . the method is technically straightforward, is not hla-restricted and is compatible with intracellular staining for cytokine expression, making it an attractive alternative to tetramer staining in some situations. we recently presented the first detailed description of cd154+ t cell responses following birch allergen stimulation in allergic and non-allergic subjects  <cit> . in this study, we explore the frequency and phenotype of t cells responding to grass pollen – a true seasonal allergen – and cat allergen, a perennial allergen. the findings are confirmatory of previous reports, and include: a higher frequency of t cells responding to cat dander compared to grass pollen allergen, a higher frequency of late-differentiated cd27- t cells responding to grass pollen compared to cat dander allergen; a mixed t cell responses to allergens, but with a higher th2: th <dig> ratio in sensitised subjects. we also demonstrate a close correlation between the frequency of th <dig> cells responding to cat dander allergen and the cat allergen-specific ige level and show that the assay system cannot differentiate between asymptomatic sensitisation and allergic disease.

the allergen-specificity of t cell responses in our experiments have not been confirmed, which is a weakness of the study. the cd154+ population in our experiments is far greater than the allergen-specific cell frequency reported using other methods  <cit> , and most likely represents an enriched population. the vast majority of our positive findings relate to the cd154/cytokine double-positive population, the frequency of which is more in keeping with previous literature. demonstrating allergen specificity in this assay system is not straightforward: intracellular staining for cd <dig> precludes live cell sorting; specificity for pathogen-reactive t cells has been demonstrated using a modified method that utilises extracellular cd <dig> staining  <cit> , however, the frequency of responding cells following allergen stimulation is small, and cloning experiments – with attendant limitations – would be required. a previous study with cd154/tetramer co-staining after prolonged cell culture followed by re-stimulation questioned the validity of cd <dig> as a marker for allergen-specific t cells . however, these conditions are known to invalidate the assay, which is only reliable after short-term stimulation  <cit> .

although the allergen-specificity of the t cell responses in this assay system have not been formally demonstrated, our previous paper highlights important supportive information: the frequency of th <dig> cells responding to birch allergen correlates with the levels of birch-specific ige, providing a direct link between a cellular parameter that purports to be antigen-specific and a serological parameter that is definitely allergen-specific; the th2: th <dig> ratio after pbmc stimulation with a control allergen to which an atopic subject was not sensitised was low; the frequency of t cell responding to birch allergen increased during the birch season  <cit> . confirmation of a strong correlation between th <dig> cells responding to cat dander and levels of cat-dander ige in this paper provides further support, in addition to confirmation of phenotypic data established using mhc class ii tetramers. in keeping with our previous studies of responses to birch allergen  <cit>  and other studies  <cit> , we found that responses to cat and grass allergens were very mixed, with activated th <dig>  th <dig> and tr1-like lymphocytes identified in varying proportions in allergic and non-allergic participants. although the frequency of th <dig> cells was significantly higher amongst allergic participants compared to non-allergic controls, there was considerable overlap, and the frequency of th <dig> cells did not differ significantly. the overlap of th <dig> responses to cat allergen was particularly marked; notably, a modified th <dig> response to cat allergen in health has been reported by platts-mills et al. <cit>  characterised by strong il- <dig> and il- <dig> production, albeit in highly-exposed subjects.

using correlation analysis, we demonstrate a novel relationship between the frequencies of t cell subsets in grass and cat allergen tolerance, maintaining a low th2: th <dig> ratio and an appropriate frequency of il-10+ t cells. this relationship was dysregulated in allergic patients, in whom the correlation between t cell subsets was weaker or lost and the th2: th <dig> ratio maintained at higher levels. this mathematical relationship between the frequency of il <dig> expression and ifnγ/il <dig> responses in health further supports what akdis and colleagues described as a “fine balance between th <dig>  th <dig> and tr1-like responses”  <cit> .

we also confirm important differences between t cell responses to cat allergen and grass pollen allergens. studies with mhc class ii tetramers suggest a higher frequency of circulating t cells responding to perennial compared to seasonal allergens  <cit> : on the basis of the cd <dig> response, our data support this view, although the finding must be interpreted with caution as comparison is difficult when stimulating with different allergen extracts, even when the experiments are optimised. it has been hypothesised that responses to perennial allergens are directed at a broader range of epitopes compared to seasonal allergens, resulting in a larger composite signal  <cit> .

secondly, we demonstrate that the frequency of cd27- effector memory t cells within the th <dig> compartment was significantly higher in grass-allergic participants, supporting the view that t cell responses to seasonal allergens comprise a higher proportion of late-differentiated t cells  <cit> . in contrast, th <dig> cells in cat-allergic individuals were consistent with an early-differentiated phenotype. a number of groups have demonstrated a predominantly early-differentiated phenotype in t cells responding to cat allergen using mhc tetramer experiments  <cit> . a recent study by wambre and colleagues also demonstrated early- and late-differentiated t cell phenotypes for perennial  and seasonal  allergens  <cit> . it has been hypothesised that chronic allergen exposure could maintain a persistent central memory profile for perennial allergens. wambre and colleagues investigated the differentiation stages of aln g 1-specific t cells before and after specific immunotherapy for alder pollen allergy  <cit> . pathogenic responses, defined as th <dig> cytokine production from crth2+ cells, were specifically associated with the late-differentiated cd27- t cells, dominating in allergic individuals but absent in healthy control subjects. specific immunotherapy induced depletion of this cd27- th <dig> cell population in favour of a predominantly cd27+ “protective” t cell response, therefore indicating the expression of cd <dig> can define distinct subsets of allergen-specific t cells. similarly, bonvalet et al. illustrated a reduction in cd27- th <dig> cells following grass pollen-specific immunotherapy, although this did not correlate with clinical efficacy  <cit> . certainly, central memory t cells have been associated with persistent long-lived responses to antigens and in persistent viral infections. literature investigating virus-specific lymphocytes hypothesised the nature and timing of antigen stimulation may influence the generation of memory t cells  <cit> , in which chronic viral infection, such as cytomegalovirus, is associated with a central memory t cell phenotype  <cit> . in addition, cd <dig> expression has been utilised to discriminate active and latent tuberculosis infection, in which the loss of cd <dig> expression marks active infection, compared to latent, chronic infection exhibiting high cd <dig> expression  <cit> .

asymptomatic sensitisation – where ige results are positive in the absence of a clinical history of symptoms upon exposure – is an important issue in clinic. an assay capable of discriminating the two would be highly desirable, particularly in the settings of food, drug and venom allergy. unfortunately, the th2:th <dig> ratio and other t cell-based markers in this assay were not able to discriminate subjects with asymptomatic sensitisation and true clinical allergy to grass, birch and cat allergens. it is possible that more refined assays with a greater number of markers could have improved predictive value, or it may be that t cell responses are too upstream of early phase symptoms to be useful.

CONCLUSIONS
we confirm our previous descriptions of a close relationship between th <dig>  th <dig> and tr1-like responses to grass and cat allergen in health that maintains a low th2: th <dig> ratio. in allergic individuals, this relationship is dysregulated with a higher th2: th <dig> ratio and ige concentration that correlates with the frequency of th <dig> cells. in keeping with tetramer-based studies, we illustrate a higher proportion of late-differentiated th <dig> cells responding to seasonal allergens compared to the early-differentiated phenotype of cat-specific th <dig> cells. the detection of cd154+ t cells following short-term allergen stimulation is a useful method for the investigation of allergen-specific t cells, but using our current panel does not discriminate between allergy and asymptomatic sensitisation.
