BACKGROUND
plant species gradually mature through four phases:  embryonic,  postembryonic juvenile vegetative,  mature vegetative, and  mature reproductive  <cit> . the most pronounced maturity trait is flowering capacity, but other traits, such the ability to form adventitious roots , are modified during the phase changes . in many woody plants, rooting ability is expressed at the base of the stem, which retains juvenile characteristics throughout the plant life, and is sharply or gradually lost upon transition to the mature phase  <cit> .

initial indications of the molecular control of the vegetative phase change  came from analyses of maize  mutants. the teopod <dig> and teopod <dig> mutations led to extended expression of juvenile traits, among which was an increase in the number of nodes bearing ars  <cit> . in contrast, the glossy <dig> mutation in maize accelerated the appearance of adult characteristics in juvenile leaves  <cit> . later, the glossy <dig> gene, that encodes apetala2-like  <cit> , was found to be regulated by mir <dig>  <cit> . corngrass <dig>  is a maize mutant in which juvenile traits are retained during the adult reproductive phase  <cit> . the molecular basis of cg <dig> is overexpression of mir <dig>  concomitant with lower levels of mir <dig>  <cit> . similarly, tomato  plants overexpressing mir <dig> exhibited increased development of stem ars  <cit> . mir <dig> and mir <dig> have been found to coordinate the juvenile-to-mature phase change in arabidopsis. mir <dig> targets the transcription factors squamosa promoter binding protein like   <dig> and  <dig> that promote mir172b transcription, which in turn exhibits a regulatory feedback loop with its targets toe <dig> and 2
 <cit> .

mir <dig> and mir <dig> have been shown to have similar expression patterns in various woody plants, including acacia confusa, acacia colei, eucalyptus globulus, hedera helix, quercus acutissima, and populus x canadensis, during the juvenile-to-mature phase change  <cit> . overexpression of mir <dig> in transgenic poplar  reduced the expression of mir156-targeted spl genes and mir <dig> and prolonged the juvenile phase  <cit> . taken together, these data indicate that mir <dig> is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of the vegetative phase change in both herbaceous and woody plants, whereas mir <dig> is a regulator of maturity  <cit> .

other mirnas have been shown to be directly involved in ar formation in arabidopsis, with arf <dig>  a target of mir <dig>  being a negative regulator, and arf <dig> and arf <dig>  targets of mir <dig>  being positive regulators  <cit> . these transcription factors are also involved in regulation of the cross-talk between auxin and jasmonic acid pathways during ar formation  <cit> .

the juvenile-to-mature phase change of eucalyptus grandis was previously characterized  <cit> . it was shown that rooting capability was higher in cuttings excised below node  <dig>  termed juvenile, than in those excised above node  <dig>  termed mature  <cit> . the sequencing of eucalyptus grandis genome has made the plant a valuable experimental system. in the present study, a comprehensive profiling of mirnas was carried out and the expression of mir <dig> and mir <dig> was studied in relation to the loss of rooting ability in juvenile and mature cuttings of e. grandis and e. brachyphylla.

RESULTS
profiling of mirna expression
to obtain a maximum spectrum of mirnas expressed in e. grandis, total rna was extracted from 14-day-old intact seedlings and subjected to mirna discovery-oriented deep sequencing. after filtering, a large number of the reads matched t/rrna sequences . analysis by the shortstack application  <cit>  revealed  <dig> known and  <dig> novel micrornas in the e. grandis rna sample . among the conserved micrornas were mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  blast results for the predicted targets of conserved mirnas identified in e. grandis  indicated that most of them were similar to predicted targets documented in other plants. the predicted targets for the novel mirnas identified by the shortstack analysis are listed in additional file 3: table s <dig> table  <dig> sequence data analysis

a series of digital filters were employed on the raw readings to discard sequences irrelevant to microrna identification.



northern blot analysis was performed to determine possible changes in mirna expression during induction of ar formation in juvenile and mature cuttings . cuttings were excised from different stem sections of stock plants of the same chronological age. juvenile cuttings were excised from  <dig> to  <dig> cm above the ground, and mature cuttings from about  <dig> m above the ground. under these experimental conditions, ar primordia start to form, after  <dig> to  <dig> days only in juvenile cuttings, confirming earlier studies showing that shoots in close proximity to the root system retain juvenile traits  <cit> . no consistent differences were found between juvenile and mature cuttings in the expression of mir <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  during the first  <dig> days after excision and auxin application. in addition, the expression levels of the corresponding predicted targets of these mirnas were analyzed in the above cuttings by the nanostring method . no consistent differences were found between them, except for nac <dig> which was gradually upregulated only in juvenile cuttings during ar induction .

expression of mir <dig> and mir <dig> in relation to the loss of rooting ability
changes in mir <dig> and mir <dig> expression have been found to be key regulators of the juvenile-to-mature phase change  <cit> . here, the pattern of mir <dig> and mir <dig> expression was determined in the tissue giving rise to ar formation in two plant systems. the first was e. grandis, in which a third type of cutting was excised  <dig> cm above the ground, termed midphase . the rooting potential was found to decrease with increasing distance from the ground from which the cuttings were collected . in parallel to the loss of rooting potential, an increase in callus formation was observed, in agreement with previous findings in other woody plants . while mir <dig> expression declined slightly during maturation, mir <dig> exhibited an opposite pattern, with significant elevated levels in mature cuttings compared to juvenile ones , in agreement with previous findings in other trees  <cit> . interestingly, in midephase, the decline in expression of mir <dig> and the increase in that of mir <dig> compared to juvenile cuttings was not significant, but the difference in rooting ability and increase in callus formation between these cutting was statistically significant . we concluded that the loss of rooting ability in e. grandis may precede a significant decline and increase in mir <dig> and mir <dig> expression, respectively, in the tissue giving rise to ar formation.figure  <dig>

expression of mir <dig> and mir <dig> in relation to loss of rooting ability in e. brachyphylla
we examined the relationship between mir <dig> and mir <dig> expression and the loss of rooting ability in another eucalyptus species, e. brachyphylla. this species is an ornamental plant characterized by bluish leaves. eucalyptus trees with bluish leaves exhibit a loss of rooting ability early in their juvenile phase  <cit> . comparison of the rooting ability of e. brachyphylla plants at different ages revealed that rooting ability could be detected up to  <dig> month age, lost at  <dig> month age, but could be restored by rejuvenation in tissue culture . concomitantly, mir <dig> was highly expressed at the base of the above cuttings at  <dig> month age, after which it declined, whereas mir <dig> expression was barely detectable in plants younger than  <dig> months . to restore the rooting ability of mature e. brachyphylla, rejuvenation under tissue-culture conditions was performed . interestingly, the expression of both mirnas was very similar in both  <dig> month age plants and in plantlets that originated from similar plants, and kept in rejuvenation conditions for  <dig> months for restoration of rooting ability. the data indicate that, rooting ability was not mutually related to a high mir <dig> expression, and loss of rooting ability was not mutually related to high mir <dig> expression in the tissue giving rise to ars.figure  <dig>

profiling the expression of mir <dig> and mir <dig> and their predicted targets during induction of ar in e. grandis
to determine the functionality of mir <dig> and mir <dig> during the induction of ar formation, their expression was monitored at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days after rooting was induced. in addition, the expression of a representative predicted target of each of these mirnas was determined in the same rna samples . in agreement with previous studies  <cit> , figure  <dig> shows that while the expression of mir <dig> was higher in juvenile cuttings than in mature ones on day  <dig>  expression of its predicted target egspl <dig> was significantly lower in the juvenile cuttings. similarly, while the expression of mir <dig> was lower in juvenile cuttings than in mature ones on day  <dig>  the expression of its predicted target egapetala  <dig> was higher in the former, in agreement with previous data . interestingly, mir <dig> expression was not affected during the first  <dig> days of induction, whereas that of egspl <dig> in mature cuttings decreased after  <dig> day and remained low. similarly, the expression of mir <dig> in mature cuttings and that of egapetala <dig> in juvenile cuttings decreased after  <dig> day and remained low until day  <dig>  these changes led to equalization of the expression of both mirnas and predicted targets in juvenile and mature cuttings during  <dig> to  <dig> days after rooting induction, although only juvenile cuttings formed roots under these conditions.figure  <dig>

discussion
the change from juvenile to mature phase in plants is a gradual process; culminating in the most recognizable developmental process—flower production. however, prior to the change to the reproductive phase, there is a change from juvenile to adult vegetative phase  <cit> . the characteristics of this transition are more subtle and differ from one plant species to the other. for example, in arabidopsis, juvenile characteristics include round and small leaves, lacking trichomes on their abaxial side  <cit> . the juvenile characteristics in maize include leaf epidermal wax and nodes bearing ars  <cit> . it has been shown that mir <dig> is a regulator of this vegetative phase change in both arabidopsis and maize. overexpression of mir <dig> in arabidopsis led to increased number of small and round leaves without abaxial trichomes  <cit> . in maize, it led to increased number of leaves with epidermal wax and nodes with ars  <cit> . furthermore, mir <dig> expression has been found to be correlated with changes in leaf shape in different woody plants  <cit> . in agreement with previous studies, our observations show that in both e. grandis and e. brachyphylla, a relatively high level of mir <dig> is expressed in juvenile tissues, although no marked changes in leaf shape between the juvenile and mature phases were observed in these eucalyptus trees, as reported for example for e. globulus
 <cit> . of note, while the expression of mirnas was previously determined in the leaves or shoot apices  <cit> , we analyzed their expression in the stems. this might explain why we could not relate the timing of the loss of rooting ability to the reduction in mir <dig> expression. in e. grandis, a significant decline in rooting ability was observed as the distance of the cutting source from the ground increased, although only a subtle decline in mir <dig> expression was observed in the same plant samples. in e. brachyphylla, a high expression of mir <dig> was observed in 2-month-old plants. this expression significantly decreased in 4-month-plants and thereafter remained more or less constant in 7- and 24-month-old plants, as well as in 7-month-old plants that were rejuvenated in tissue culture for  <dig> months. however, rooting ability was 100% in 2- and 4-month-old plants, 0% in 7- and 24-month-old plants and 60% in the rejuvenated plants. the uncoupling of mir <dig> expression and ar forming ability in these eucalyptus trees is in agreement with findings obtained from acacia species. while in acacia colei the leaf change was correlated to the reduction in mir <dig> and induction of mir <dig>  <cit> , in a mangium the leaf change was not correlated to significant differences in rooting abilities . therefore, regulation of ar formation is still unclear. on one hand, cuttings excised close to the root system possess a high rooting potential  <cit> , suggesting the transport of rooting signals from the roots to the stems. on the other hand, overexpression of mir <dig> in maize corngrass <dig> mutant led to more nodes with ars  <cit> , and denser aerial roots along the tomato stems  <cit> . expression of mir <dig> also extended the tuber-forming potential to distal axillary buds in potato and tomato  <cit> . but regulation of mir <dig> expression in arabidopsis has been shown to be root-independent and leaf-dependent  <cit> , while, rooting inhibitors have been found in leaves of mature eucalyptus trees  <cit> . it might therefore be suggested that the regulation of rooting and the regulation of mir <dig> are uncoupled, but nevertheless downstream effects of mir <dig> are relevant for ar formation. the precise relationship between mir <dig> expression and ar formation in eucalyptus has yet to be determined.

the expression of mir <dig> has been shown to be regulated by mir <dig> via spl <dig> and spl <dig>  <cit> . therefore, the decline in mir <dig> expression is expected to occur simultaneously with the increase in that of mir <dig>  indeed, such a correlation has been shown in arabidopsis
 <cit> . however, a closer look at woody plants revealed a somewhat more complicated picture. when the expression of both mirnas was analyzed in 1-month-old, and 1-, 4-, and 10-year-old poplar trees, a gradual decline in mir <dig> expression was found between 1-month and 4-year-old trees, whereas a rise in mir <dig> expression was only observed in 10-year-old trees, in which there was no further decline in mir <dig> expression  <cit> . similar observations were recorded when samples were taken from shoots at different heights  or from leaves on the same shoot located at different distances from the main stem. while a gradual decrease in mir <dig> expression was detected between shoots taken from  <dig>  and  <dig> m above the ground, no detectable change in mir <dig> expression was observed in these shoots. an increase in mir <dig> expression was detected only at  <dig> m above the ground. similarly, when expression was determined in sequential leaves on the same shoot, a gradual decrease in mir <dig> expression was observed with increasing distance from the main stem. however, mir <dig> expression increased only in the last, most distantly located leaf  <cit> . therefore, the decline in mir <dig> expression preceded the rise in mir <dig> expression. our results, albeit obtained from a different tissue, the stems, also show no tight correlation between the timing of mir <dig> downregulation and mir <dig> upregulation. taken together, these data suggest that the expression of mirna <dig> and mir <dig> in woody plants is governed by a complex regulation system, which specifically in cuttings, might be also influenced by wounding, the decrease in leaf area, the loss of roots, and a long rooting period under varying environmental conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
it is concluded that in e. grandis and e. brachyphylla, there is no mutual relationship between easy-to-root cuttings and high mir <dig> or difficult to root cuttings and high mir <dig> expression at the base of these cuttings.
