BACKGROUND
water is essential for life, but some organisms have the ability to survive extreme desiccation by entering a state of suspended animation in a process known as anhydrobiosis   <cit> . in the dry state, metabolism and life processes come to a halt. anhydrobiotic organisms are capable of surviving in this state for an indefinite period of time after which, when environmental conditions become favourable, the organism can resume normal metabolic activity  <cit> . these organisms are widespread throughout nature and include yeasts, bdelloid rotifers, tardigrades, plants and nematodes. for example, the resurrection plant craterostigma plantagineum can recover from loss of most of its cellular fluid within  <dig> h of contact with water  <cit> . many nematode species are also able to enter anhydrobiosis, for example, aphelenchus avenae and panagrolaimus superbus  <cit> . some steinernemitid species also exhibit partial desiccation tolerance  <cit> .

anhydrobiosis is often associated with the accumulation of disaccharides and other oligosaccharides, chiefly trehalose in animals and yeasts, and sucrose in plants  <cit> . these sugars have been suggested to play a role in protecting membranes and proteins by replacing structural water or by forming a stabilising intracellular glass that would inhibit membrane fusion and protein denaturation; they might also be involved in maintaining membrane fluidity  <cit> . however, it has been shown in a. avenae, one of the best-characterised anhydrobiotic nematodes, that while it accumulates trehalose prior to anhydrobiosis, probably at least partly due to upregulation of trehalose synthase genes  <cit> , this alone is not sufficient  <cit> . in other desiccation-tolerant invertebrates, such as bdelloid rotifers  <cit>  and some tardigrades  <cit> , disaccharide accumulation is not detectable. in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, trehalose biosynthesis can be abolished by mutation while retaining 50-100% capacity to survive desiccation, depending on the strain  <cit> . this suggests that while trehalose might play a role in anhydrobiosis, at least in some species, there must be other important biological processes involved  <cit> . these processes might include changes in primary metabolism; alterations to cell membranes; the accumulation of compatible solutes and hydrophilic proteins; and activation of antioxidant and molecular chaperone systems.

one group of proteins receiving increasing attention is the lea  proteins. these were first associated with desiccation tolerance in plant seeds and resurrection plants , but recently homologues of group  <dig> lea proteins have been linked to anhydrobiosis in certain nematodes  <cit>  and other invertebrates  <cit> . group  <dig> lea proteins are characterized by extreme hydrophilicity and 11-amino acid periodicity; they have relatively little secondary structure in the hydrated state, but can become more structured on drying  <cit> . a nematode group  <dig> lea protein from a. avenae, aavlea <dig>  has been shown to function as a protein anti-aggregant both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . it has therefore been postulated that many lea proteins possess a molecular shield activity whereby they reduce inappropriate interactions between other proteins by an electrosteric mechanism  <cit> . lea proteins also exhibit other activities consistent with a role in protection of cells against abiotic stress, including membrane protection, ion binding, antioxidant functions, hydration buffering and nucleic acid binding .

in this study we have constructed an est  library of genes upregulated on desiccation in the free-living mycophagous nematode a. avenae and have investigated their expression profiles under various stress conditions. we have identified a new lea protein gene, as well as other stress response genes, and have used a cross-species gene silencing approach to assess the importance of a subset of the est panel for anhydrobiosis. our findings indicate that glutathione peroxidases represent a key class of enzymes required for desiccation tolerance in the nematodes tested and emphasise the need for redox balancing in anhydrobiosis.

RESULTS
an est dataset from a. avenae enriched for dehydration-induced sequences
a 5' oligo capping method was used to construct an est library of genes enriched in those upregulated on drying in a. avenae: an initial screen of  <dig> clones by reverse northern dot blots, using cdna from both dried and control nematodes in parallel experiments, yielded  <dig> ests which appeared to be induced by desiccation. from these, a subset of  <dig> ests showing significant blast matches to sequences from other organisms, and  <dig> ests representing apparently novel sequences, were selected for further study .

where accession numbers are shown in bold, respective sequences were used in cross-species rnai experiments with p. superbus. aclosest homologue in the genbank database using the tblastx tool http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast; where indicated by an asterix, blastx against the c. elegans genome was used instead http://www.wormbase.org/db/searches/blast_blat. relative expression following exposure of nematodes to four environmental stresses is shown at right of table. values in regular type represent a statistically significant upregulation in gene expression with respect to a. avenae  <dig> s rrna and ama- <dig> genes; values in grey font are not significant.

the ests include a novel homologue of known group  <dig> lea protein genes: this cdna sequence  is full length, as indicated by the presence of a spliced leader sequence  at its 5' end and a polya tail at the 3' end. the cdna is  <dig> bp long, excluding the polya tail, and its longest open reading frame predicts a protein of  <dig> amino acids with mr  <dig> and pi  <dig> . the closest blastx match is with lea- <dig> of caenorhabditis elegans and, although the blast score is not highly significant , other features of the predicted protein sequence identify it as a group  <dig> lea protein. for example, the predicted protein sequence has a section of k <dig> periodicity, with two interlaced runs of three lysines at residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 62; popp analysis  <cit>  places it cleanly within the group  <dig> lea protein cluster; it lacks cysteine and tryptophan residues; it is hydrophilic along its entire length according to a hydropathy plot based on the eisenberg consensus scale, with a grand average hydropathy  score of - <dig>  indicating extreme hydrophilicity . predictors of protein disorder suggest the protein is natively unfolded: the vl-xt algorithm at pondr.com indicates 95% disorder, while foldindex and iupred both return predictions of 100% disorder; and a uversky plot of mean net charge against mean scaled hydropathy places the protein firmly among the set of intrinsically disordered proteins . all the above properties are consistent with this example being a new group  <dig> lea protein and therefore we designate it aavlea <dig>  and its gene aav-lea- <dig> 

a second example from the est dataset, ef <dig>  also encodes a hydrophilic protein but it is less clearly identifiable as an lea protein. the cdna is again full length, with spliced leader  and polya tail, whose  <dig> bp insert encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids in its longest open reading frame, with mr  <dig> and pi  <dig> . the protein has a gravy score of - <dig> , and a hydropathy plot shows it to be hydrophilic along almost its entire length. disorder prediction algorithms are consistent with it being unfolded - vl-xt, foldindex and iupred predict 78%, 100% and 100% disorder respectively - and the uversky plot positions the protein within natively unfolded space . popp analysis shows clustering with group  <dig> and group  <dig> lea proteins, but only at the level of band  <dig>  indicating that this association is rather weak. furthermore, there is no k <dig>  and limited a <dig>  periodicity and the predicted protein sequence includes one cysteine and one tryptophan, which it is unusual to find in group  <dig> lea proteins. a blastx run against the c. elegans genome returns lea- <dig> as the top hit, although the score is weak ; a blast enquiry against the whole sequence collection returns as best hit  an lea-like sequence from the antarctic bacterium polaromonas sp. js <dig>  intriguingly, though, using blast to compare the ef <dig> protein against aavlea <dig>  described above, gives a score of 5e- <dig>  indicating a match of respectable significance. when aligned, the two predicted protein sequences are given as  <dig> % identical with the align algorithm. in summary, the bioinformatics are consistent with this example being a hydrophilic, intrinsically disordered protein which probably has a distant evolutionary relationship to the group  <dig> lea proteins. for the moment, therefore, we consider it to be an lea-like hypothetical protein.

while the presence of lea and lea-like protein gene sequences among the dehydration-induced est dataset is in line with a presumed role for these polypeptides in the response to water stress, several other genes associated with stress responses were also found. for example, genes encoding: myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase which controls synthesis of an osmolyte, myo-inositol, implicated in desiccation tolerance  <cit> ; aha- <dig>  a stress-regulated activator of the atpase activity of molecular chaperone hsp <dig>  <cit> ; and glutathione peroxidase, which catalyses the reduction of hydroxyperoxides by glutathione and is important in the response to oxidative stress .

the control of the response to desiccation is very poorly understood and therefore it is of interest that a number of genes involved in signal transduction and the regulation of gene activity were recovered from the screen. for example, three zinc finger protein genes were identified , encoding a c2h <dig> zinc finger family member , a gata-type zinc finger , and a ring finger domain protein . the latter is most likely involved in the regulation of protein activity, rather than gene regulation directly; it gives a best blast hit with mnat- <dig>  a c. elegans gene whose protein is probably involved in the ubiquitination pathway as an e3-type ubiquitin ligase. it is also implicated in stabilising the cdk-activating kinase intrinsic to cell cycle progression through its mat <dig> domain and is functionally associated with tfii, the transcription/dna repair factor . the zinc finger proteins represented by gr <dig> and gr <dig> would merit further investigation as candidate anhydrobiotic gene set regulators: several transcription factors were found to be upregulated by water loss in steinernema feltiae  <cit> , s. carpocapsae  <cit>  and plectus murrayi  <cit> , and a gata-type transcription factor  has been found to regulate c. elegans transcription during the innate immune response and osmotic stress  <cit> ; in plants, many gene regulators have been characterised in the response to drought . another gene, represented by gr <dig>  encodes a dual specificity phosphatase able to hydrolyse phosphate from tyr and ser/thr residues; such phosphatases are key players in signal transduction, for example, in mapk pathways, and in cell cycle regulation  <cit> . dr <dig> encodes a homologue of c. elegans unc- <dig> which is primarily involved in vesicle transport, but whose protein is also known to interact with the mapk, jnk, and also with jnk kinases; it thus functionally intersects with signal transduction pathways. further investigation of these genes could therefore lead to improved understanding of the dehydration stress response in nematodes.

twelve of the selected ests encode novel proteins that have no matches in the genbank or wormpep databases . six of these are predicted to be unusually hydrophilic  or largely disordered  or both, and all are predicted to be charged at physiological ph.  although they are clearly not lea proteins, these novel proteins are reminiscent of anhydrin, another highly hydrophilic, disordered protein previously described in a. avenae, whose gene expression is induced by drying  <cit> . the prevalence of such proteins, albeit from a very limited sample, is intriguing and invites further investigation in the context of desiccation tolerance.

where accession numbers are shown in bold, respective ests were used in cross-species rnai experiments with p. superbus. expression values in regular type represent a statistically significant upregulation in gene expression with respect to  <dig> s rrna and ama- <dig> genes; values in grey font are not significant. §pondr vl-xt predictions. *the reading frame selected was from the same strand as the spliced leader sequence. †the reading frame selected was from the same strand as the polya tail. where such landmarks were not available the longest predicted open reading frame was used to estimate physico-chemical parameters.

evidence for horizontal gene transfer in a. avenae
homologues of two polygalacturonase genes in the fungi aspergillus awamori and penicillium griseoroseum  <cit>  were found in the a. avenae est set. these genes seem to be derived from the a. avenae genome and are not a result of fungal contamination since preliminary southern hybridisation experiments show they are not present in rhizoctonia solani, the food source used . polygalacturonases  hydrolyse  <dig> -alpha-d-galactosiduronic linkages in pectin, a major component of the cell walls of plants  <cit> . plant pathogenic bacteria and fungi secrete hydrolytic enzymes such as polygalacturonases and cellulases to degrade plant cell walls. plant parasitic nematodes also secrete a great diversity of plant cell-wall degrading enzymes including cellulases and galacturonases. phylogenetic analyses support the interpretation that the cellulases and polygalacturonases present in cyst and root-knot nematodes have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer from bacteria  <cit> . in contrast, the polygalacturonase genes of a. avenae appear to be derived by horizontal transfer from fungi . interestingly a polygalacturonase gene found in the genome of the rice weevil sitophilus oryzae also appears to have been incorporated into the genome of this insect by horizontal gene transfer from a fungal source  <cit> . while the cellulase and polygalacturonase genes of the root-knot nematode m. incognita are most closely related to bacterial sequences, genome-wide analysis indicates that three other plant-cell wall degrading/modifying enzymes in this nematode  may be of fungal origin  <cit> , and it has also been shown that the cellulases of the pine wood nematode are most similar to cellulases from fungi  <cit> . a. avenae is routinely cultured in the laboratory on fungi such as rhizoctonia solani or botrytus cinerea, but a. avenae is also capable of growing and reproducing in vitro on tissue cultures prepared from several plant species  <cit>  and it has also been shown that a. avenae will feed and multiply on plant roots, and suppress growth  <cit> . the occurrence of a plant cell wall degrading enzyme in a. avenae provides further evidence that in addition to feeding on fungi a. avenae might also utilise plant tissues as a food source in nature.

multiple variant spliced leaders in a. avenae mrnas
spliced leaders derive from specific snrnas and are coupled to pre-mrnas through a trans-splicing mechanism during mrna maturation  <cit> . previously, 22-nucleotide spliced leader sequences representing four variants of the sl <dig> sequence characterised in c. elegans have been described at the 5' ends of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase  mrnas in a. avenae  <cit> . all four of these sl <dig> sequences were found in the ests described here, together with eight additional variants . uncovering a total of  <dig> different sequences from a relatively small sample of mrna sequences suggests a degree of spliced leader polymorphism in a. avenae similar to that reported for trichinella spiralis  <cit> . interestingly, four variants  show striking similarity to sl <dig>  the second main form of spliced leader found in c. elegans, which is associated with the resolution of polycistronic pre-mrnas resulting from operon transcription. sl <dig> is postulated to have first evolved in the rhabditine lineage which includes c. elegans  <cit> , but the data of table  <dig> suggest that this family of spliced leaders is also present in the tylenchina, which includes a. avenae, and therefore must have arisen no later than the common ancestor of the two sister groups within nematoda. it will be interesting therefore to investigate whether sl2-like trans-splicing is used for processing of operon transcripts in a. avenae, like c. elegans, instead of sl <dig>  as found in all other nematodes to date outside the rhabditina  <cit> .

sl1a to sl1d are described in ref.  <cit> . the two canonical spliced leader sequences from c. elegans are listed for comparison. in cases where a. avenae ests are not listed, the respective cdnas are incomplete at the 5' end and cannot be assessed for spliced leader use.

regulation of gene expression after exposure to environmental stress
the expression of  <dig> a. avenae genes in response to evaporative water loss , increased osmotic potential , cold  and heat  was evaluated by quantitative pcr . two thirds of the recognisable genes were found to be upregulated by drying, thus validating the selection procedure and implicating the est set in anhydrobiosis. interestingly, the large majority of genes analysed were also responsive to osmotic stress and cold , probably reflecting similar effects on water activity and overlapping stress responses to all three environmental conditions. in contrast, heat stress caused relatively few genes to be induced, with 30% responding to elevated temperature, implicating a rather different response mechanism.

the degree of expression varied widely between genes although anova analysis showed that, in most cases, a  <dig> -fold increase in expression levels was significant . nevertheless, some genes were highly upregulated: the lea protein and lea-like genes  showed a 43-fold and 36-fold increase in expression level, respectively, in response to desiccation, and a response to osmotic stress in excess of 20-fold. these genes were also substantially upregulated on exposure to low temperature . other genes were not induced to the same levels in most cases, but notable results include that of a glutathione peroxidase  whose mrna concentration increased 32- and 14-fold in response to desiccation and osmotic stress, respectively; a dj-1-like gene  showed a 10-fold induction on desiccation; and an aha <dig> activator gene  also showed high relative expression levels following exposure to desiccation and osmotic stress. the above results are consistent with a requirement for increased antioxidant and molecular shield/chaperone activity during water stress, as has been noted previously . of the novel genes , four showed more than 10-fold upregulation on osmotic stress and two displayed over five-fold induction in response to desiccation.

a. avenae is recalcitrant to rna interference
although the selective cloning procedure and the expression data of tables  <dig> and  <dig> implicate the large majority of the gene set in anhydrobiosis, it would be desirable to obtain more direct evidence that they are required for survival of the dry state. to this end, we sought to establish rna interference  in a. avenae as a tool to selectively eliminate or reduce gene activity. populations of a. avenae in which expression of particular genes had been reduced by gene silencing could then be assessed for desiccation tolerance; where survival was compromised, the respective genes would be strongly implicated in anhydrobiosis. rnai occurs in c. elegans after injection of double-stranded rna  corresponding to the target gene into worms  <cit> , after soaking nematodes in a dsrna solution  <cit>  or after feeding nematodes on bacteria expressing dsrna  <cit> . the last of these methods is not available to us since a. avenae do not feed on bacteria. therefore, attempts were made at injecting dsrna into a. avenae but these were unsuccessful due to technical difficulties relating to the small size of the worms. the injection method is also laborious and is not amenable to studies at the population level, which is usually required for assessment of desiccation tolerance. a soaking method was therefore attempted using dsrna corresponding to the rna polymerase ii large  subunit gene, ama- <dig>  which is known to give a lethal phenotype when silenced in c. elegans and other nematodes such as the human parasitic species brugia malayi  <cit> . two cdna sequences corresponding to the a. avenae ama- <dig> transcript were cloned using primers directed against conserved peptide sequences identified in an alignment of nematode and other rna polymerase ii large subunit genes  <cit> . soaking of a. avenae for  <dig> h in  <dig> mg/ml ama- <dig> dsrna did not, however, show a phenotype compared to negative control experiments . positive technical controls were performed using c. elegans and cognate ama- <dig> sequences, resulting in sick animals within  <dig> h. further controls were also carried out using unc- <dig> and gfp dsrna on wild-type and gfp-expressing c. elegans  to confirm the effectiveness of rnai.

to determine whether dsrna molecules were taken up by a. avenae, nematodes were soaked in fluorescently-labeled dsrna  for a period of approximately  <dig> h. wild type c. elegans was used as a positive control. fluorescence was observed in the gut of c. elegans by confocal microscopy but no signal was observed in a. avenae, suggesting that dsrna is not ingested efficiently in this species . addition of the neuromodulator, octopamine, at concentrations up to  <dig> mm, which has been reported to improve dsrna uptake in some parasitic nematodes  <cit> , did not stimulate ingestion in a. avenae. therefore, perhaps due to its feeding mechanism which involves stylet puncture of target fungal or plant tissues  <cit> , it is likely that a. avenae is not readily amenable to rnai by the soaking method.

cross-species rnai of anhydrobiosis genes
one strategy which might partially circumvent difficulties with rnai in a. avenae is cross-species gene silencing using a. avenae sequences to reduce expression of homologous transcripts in another anhydrobiotic nematode. cross-species rnai has been shown using sequences from the animal parasitic nematode, ascaris suum, in c. elegans, for example  <cit> . recent work by one of our groups  has demonstrated efficient systemic rnai in panagrolaimus superbus, a nematode in the same phylogenetic group as a. avenae with a marked resistance to desiccation. indeed, since p. superbus is a bacterivore, it is susceptible to large scale rnai in nematode populations using a feeding method very similar to that used routinely in c. elegans  <cit> .

from the a. avenae est set,  <dig> candidates  were selected for rnai in p superbus. the majority of these were chosen because they showed a high degree of similarity to sequences in c. elegans and/or caenorhabditis briggsae, the rationale being that they were then more likely to have similar counterparts in p. superbus: both p. superbus and a. avenae are tylenchid nematodes, and thus more closely related in evolutionary terms than either is to the genus caenorhabditis  <cit> . for comparison, three of the  <dig> ests chosen were novel sequences .

p. superbus were fed bacteria expressing dsrna corresponding to individual a. avenae sequences, after which worms were first pre-conditioned at 90% rh for  <dig> h followed by  <dig> h desiccation at 10% rh. the worms were then rehydrated overnight in buffer before scoring for survival. worms fed dsrna corresponding to gfp and treated similarly were taken as negative controls. prior to desiccation, nematodes were also subjected to phenotypic analysis, but none of the experiments performed revealed any extraordinary change in morphology or behaviour, either of adults, larvae or embryos .

this first drying experiment was used as a preliminary screen; four candidates which showed a reduction in desiccation tolerance of at least 10% compared to controls were chosen for a second round of rnai and desiccation: gr <dig> ; gr <dig> ; gr <dig> ; and gr <dig> . survival of p. superbus after rnai treatment and desiccation was compared to nematode viability after mock desiccation, in which worms were subjected to 100% rh; as previously, a gfp negative control was also performed . in this experiment, rnai treatment with both gr <dig> and gr <dig> resulted in no significant reduction in survival following desiccation compared to non-dried and gfp controls. therefore, neither was considered to have a measurable rnai effect. however, gr <dig> and gr <dig> did show significant  reduction in survival of drying after rnai to 66% and 59%, compared to 84% and 75%, respectively, without desiccation. these results therefore suggest that glutathione peroxidase and an additional uncharacterised gene  are contributors to desiccation tolerance in p. superbus, and by extension in a. avenae.

glutathione peroxidase gene activity contributes to anhydrobiosis in p. superbus
if the cross-species strategy used above is valid, then genes that are upregulated in response to desiccation in a. avenae, and that have well-conserved sequence counterparts in p. superbus, should be part of an anhydrobiotic gene set in both nematodes. therefore, we attempted to identify genes in p. superbus which were homologues or paralogues of the two genes indicated by the cross-species rnai experiments, in order to carry out similar experiments with cognate p. superbus sequences. consequently, an est library of ~ <dig>  p. superbus cdnas  was searched for sequences corresponding to a. avenae gr <dig> and gr <dig>  although no matches were found for the novel sequence represented by gr <dig>  two different sequences showing similarity to gr <dig> were obtained, ps <dig>  and ps <dig> , both of which are similar to glutathione peroxidase sequences in genbank and other databases. for example, both ps <dig> and ps <dig> gave highly significant matches with the c. elegans glutathione peroxidase gene c11e <dig> , showing blastx scores of 2e- <dig> and 1e- <dig>  respectively. the ests probably represent different genes in p. superbus since they are only 66% identical using the align tool.

rnai experiments were therefore carried out in p. superbus with these sequences, together with a. avenae gr <dig>  and gfp sequences as positive and negative controls, respectively. figure  <dig> confirms that rnai using the a. avenae glutathione peroxidase sequence reduces desiccation tolerance in p. superbus. moreover, the two glutathione peroxidase sequences from the p. superbus est library also showed a pronounced rnai effect on survival after drying. these results strongly implicate a role for glutathione peroxidases in nematode anhydrobiosis and provide the first genetic evidence for the importance of antioxidants in metazoan desiccation tolerance.

discussion
anhydrobiosis is one of the most fascinating biological phenomena, yet the molecular mechanisms involved are still relatively poorly understood. the application of recently-developed molecular techniques to the study of anhydrobiosis has been hampered by the lack of a suitable desiccation-tolerant model organism, certainly among the metazoans, for which genome sequence and genetic tools are not yet available. perhaps the best-characterised metazoan example is the nematode, a. avenae, in which the physiology and biochemistry of anhydrobiosis has been studied since the 1970s . to gain insight into the set of genes employed by a. avenae to achieve the anhydrobiotic state, which can be termed the anhydrobiotic gene set, or the desiccome  <cit> , we have used a selective cloning technique to identify genes that are upregulated by evaporative water loss. the majority of genes identified were confirmed as desiccation-inducible using real-time qpcr, thus validating the cloning procedure; many examples of this gene set were also found to be responsive to osmotic stress and reduced temperature, possibly due to a common effect on water activity in all three stress conditions. relatively few members of the est set were responsive to elevated temperature, however. this fits with general observations in other invertebrates and plants where a large overlap in the stress responses to dehydration, osmotic stress and cold is observed, but where heat stress activates a different response pathway  <cit> . the complexity of the response to water loss is illustrated by the involvement of molecular chaperone/shield proteins, redox balancing systems, osmolyte biosynthetic enzymes, c-type lectins, protein and polysaccharide metabolic enzymes, as well as genes controlling gene transcription and signal transduction pathways. in particular, new lea and lea-like protein genes were identified suggesting that several proteins of this type are involved in the response to water stress in invertebrates, as in plants. it seems unlikely, however, that the diversity of the lea proteome in invertebrates will rival that of plants, where > <dig> lea protein genes can be found in a single organism  <cit> ; in c. elegans, for example, only three such genes have been noted  <cit> .

while such information on transcriptional stress responses can be extremely useful in assessing which genes and regulatory systems are involved in combating the stress imposed, it is becoming clear, at least in some organisms such as yeast, that not all stress-induced genes are essential for stress tolerance. thus, in saccharomyces cerevisiae, for example, very few genes required for dna repair were induced by dna-damaging agents  <cit> . other researchers report similar conclusions for yeast subjected to osmotic stress  <cit> , oxidative stress  <cit> , and anaerobic growth conditions  <cit> . it is therefore important, if possible, to go beyond a purely correlative study, where stress-induced genes are catalogued, to experiments where genes of interest can be mutated or silenced and the effect of this on stress tolerance determined.

silencing of specific gene targets by rnai has been invaluable in nematodes, in particular c. elegans, as an alternative to mutagenesis that allows gene function to be probed on a large scale  <cit> . such high throughput functional genomics would be ideal for identifying the anhydrobiotic gene set in a nematode such as a. avenae. unfortunately, attempts to perform rnai on a. avenae by microinjection, or by soaking in dsrna corresponding to the gene target, were not successful. this might be due to resistance or partial resistance to rnai in this species, as has been found in some animal parasitic nematodes  <cit> . however, with the soaking method, recalcitrance might simply reflect poor ingestion of surrounding medium by a. avenae, since fluorescently labelled dsrna was not visible in its intestine. alternative rnai strategies might be to attempt a biolistic delivery method, as recently demonstrated in dehydration-stressed barley leaves  <cit> , or to introduce dsrna by electroporation, as described for the gastrointestinal parasite trichostrongylus colubriformis  <cit> . however, such rnai techniques would be difficult to adapt for a high throughput screening experiment.

the cross-species method developed here, which exploits the relative ease with which rnai can be performed in p. superbus  <cit> , was extremely useful in allowing a limited screen of a. avenae sequences. only two out of  <dig> a. avenae ests tested gave a marked reduction in p. superbus desiccation tolerance, but this probably reflects a requirement by the rnai machinery for precise sequence matching between the short interfering rnas generated from dsrna and the target mrna  <cit> ; sequence divergence of homologous rna targets will reduce the efficacy of rnai across species. it is also formally possible that, as in yeast, many genes induced by water stress in a. avenae are not required for stress tolerance in p. superbus, or indeed in a. avenae. nevertheless, the observation that silencing of two particular transcripts reduces survival of drying in p. superbus is the first such demonstration in any desiccation-tolerant organism and demonstrates the potential for rnai in dissecting anhydrobiosis and determining the desiccome. this result also demonstrates the advantage of p. superbus as a model anhydrobiote. accordingly, a large cognate est dataset has already been assembled for high throughput screening by rnai for genes required in anhydrobiosis in this nematode; a number of interesting candidates have been identified and are currently being characterised . the availability of a panel of other panagrolaimus species of varying degrees of desiccation tolerance will also be useful for comparative studies of the phenomenon  <cit> .

of the two a. avenae ests that gave a phenotype in the cross-species rnai desiccation experiments, one was a novel sequence not represented in sequence collections. this est, gr <dig>  is only  <dig> bp in length and is not full length, since it lacks clearly defined 5' and 3' ends, as would be signified by a spliced leader and polya tail, respectively . nevertheless, it shows modest upregulation during desiccation and osmotic stress, and merits further investigation by isolation of full length cdna clones from a. avenae and a search for cognate sequences in p. superbus; the latter must exist for the cross-species rnai to have been successful. however, an alternative role for gr <dig> might be as a non-coding rna involved in regulating anhydrobiosis in nematodes. a precedent for this exists in the desiccation-tolerant resurrection plant, c. plantagineum, where an abundant, small non-coding rna  is able to induce tolerance in callus tissue  <cit> . cdt- <dig> is a member of a family of retroelements which govern synthesis of sirna involved in control of desiccation tolerance pathways  <cit> . formation of dsrna is probably important for cdt- <dig> function and, intriguingly, the gr <dig> sequence is predicted to form a high degree of secondary structure  by the rnafold algorithm . it will therefore be of interest to investigate this transcript further with a view to understanding its precise role in nematode anhydrobiosis.

the second est giving an rnai phenotype on desiccation, which matches glutathione peroxidase sequences in genbank and other sequence collections, was a full length cdna of  <dig> bp including its spliced leader  but excluding its polya tail. it appears to contain an open reading frame of  <dig> amino acids  bounded by a uga stop codon. however, some glutathione peroxidases are known to contain selenocysteine  <cit>  which is not directly represented in the genetic code, but is incorporated into nascent protein when the ribosome reads uga in the presence of a selenocysteine insertion element in the mrna  <cit> . therefore, the predicted open reading frame might be shorter than the actual protein length; indeed, there are two in-frame uga codons before a third, taa, stop codon is encountered, consistent with up to two selenocysteines being incorporated into the a. avenae glutathione peroxidase. the two p. superbus glutathione peroxidase ests, gr <dig>  and gr <dig> , are somewhat longer than the a. avenae example, at  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively. ps <dig> does not quite extend to the 3' end, since its open reading frame of  <dig> amino acids lacks a stop codon, while the reading frame of ps <dig> is likely complete at  <dig> residues. interestingly, both predicted proteins from p. superbus have a hydrophobic sequence of about  <dig> amino acids at their n-terminal ends consistent with an endoplasmic reticulum translocation signal. both proteins are therefore probably secreted; indeed, the best blast matches are with cuticular glutathione peroxidases from other nematodes. for example, the ps <dig> protein gives a score of 7e- <dig> with the cuticular glutathione peroxidase from brugia pahangi, also known as its major surface antigen gp <dig>  in contrast, the a. avenae protein does not contain a signal peptide and therefore is probably intracellular. as such, the a. avenae and p. superbus glutathione peroxidases described are likely to have different locations within each nematode, and to have different substrate preferences, with the secreted p. superbus examples not metabolising hydrogen peroxide but instead larger hydroperoxide substrates such as lipid peroxides. the fact that both types of enzyme are implicated in anhydrobiosis is consistent with the need to protect both intracellular and membrane targets from oxidative stress during desiccation.

to further investigate the role of antioxidants in nematode anhydrobiosis, we also identified a third p. superbus est, ps <dig> , which is likely to encode a peroxiredoxin  since it gave a highly significant blastx match  with the c. elegans prdx- <dig> gene. like glutathione peroxidases, peroxiredoxins are also thiol peroxidases involved in the control of cellular peroxide levels, and both classes of enzyme are evolutionarily related  <cit> . preliminary, unpublished results suggest that rnai treatment with peroxiredoxin dsrna also reduces survival of desiccation in p. superbus, consistent with a role for a second type of thiol peroxidase in nematode anhydrobiosis.

oxidative stress is experienced by organisms undergoing a wide range of abiotic stress conditions, probably due to malfunction of mitochondria  resulting in generation of reactive oxygen species  <cit> . accordingly, an oxidative stress response forms part of the environmental stress response defined by gasch et al.  <cit>  in yeast and is part of the minimal stress response described by kültz  <cit> . desiccation stress is no exception and it has long been recognised that antioxidants are likely to play a role in desiccation tolerance . recent global studies in plants have reinforced this perception  and, for example, peroxiredoxin and glutathione peroxidase, amongst other antioxidants, are induced by dehydration in desiccation-tolerant resurrection plants  <cit> .

the demonstration of a role for glutathione peroxidase in nematode anhydrobiosis is consistent with, and validates, the many correlative studies which have previously implicated antioxidants. in nematodes, for instance, three studies have identified dehydration-induced genes encoding antioxidant enzymes: gal et al.  <cit>  described a number of ests from s. feltiae, a desiccation-resistant entomopathogenic species, including a glutathione peroxidase; in a. avenae, a glutaredoxin gene was induced by drying, together with an lea protein gene and a gene encoding another hydrophilic protein, anhydrin  <cit> ; and, in a recent large-scale study of the antarctic nematode p. murrayi by adhikari et al. , genes encoding glutathione-s-transferase, superoxide dismutase, peroxiredoxin and glutathione peroxidase were included in a dehydration-induced est panel. the present study takes our understanding of anhydrobiosis a step further by showing a reduced level of desiccation tolerance after silencing glutathione peroxidase transcripts, thus clearly demonstrating a stress-combative role for antioxidants. further work will explore gene silencing more extensively in p. superbus to determine the desiccome in this species in more detail.

CONCLUSIONS
using a combination of differential cloning, expression profiling and cross-species rnai, we have identified a panel of genes implicated in the response to desiccation in the anhydrobiotic nematode, a. avenae. the gene set includes novel hydrophilic proteins, one of which is a previously-undescribed lea protein, and other stress response genes controlling synthesis of compatible solutes, chaperone systems and antioxidants. the large majority of these genes were upregulated by evaporative water loss, and many also by osmotic upshift and low temperature, conditions which also involve water stress. we also presented evidence for rnai recalcitrance in a. avenae, but were able to show cross-species rnai of two a. avenae sequences in another anhydrobiotic nematode, p. superbus. one of these was a novel sequence, which is potentially a non-coding regulatory rna, and the second encoded an intracellular glutathione peroxidase: both reduced survival of desiccation of p. superbus after rnai treatment. two cognate glutathione peroxidase sequences from p. superbus were also identified and, when used for rnai, were shown to have a similar effect on desiccation tolerance. these results therefore demonstrate the complex nature of desiccation tolerance and emphasise the need for effective antioxidant systems in anhydrobiosis.
