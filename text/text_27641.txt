BACKGROUND
the developmental and physiological complexity of eukaryotes could not be explained solely by the number of protein-coding genes  <cit> . for example, the drosophila melanogaster genome contains only twice as many genes as some bacterial species, although the former is far more complex in its genome organization than the latter. similarly, the number of protein-coding genes in human and nematode is extremely close. a portion of this paradox can be resolved through alternative pre-mrna splicing  <cit> . in addition, post-translational modifications can also contribute to the increased complexity and diversity of protein species  <cit> .

recent studies suggest that most of the genome are transcribed, among the transcripts only a small portion encode for proteins, whereas a large portion of the transcripts do not encode any proteins, which are generally termed non-protein coding rnas . for example, transcriptome profiling in rice  indicates that there are about  <dig> putative npcrnas, which do not overlap with any predicted open reading frames   <cit> . these npcrnas are subdivided as housekeeping npcrnas  and regulatory npcrnas or riboregulators, with the latter being further divided into short regulatory npcrnas  and long regulatory npcrnas . with the identification of micrornas and sirnas in diverse organisms, increasing evidences indicate that these short npcrnas play important roles in development, responses to biotic and abiotic stresses by cleavage of target mrnas or by interfering with translation of target genes  <cit> .

long npcrnas are transcribed by rna polymerase ii, polyadenylated and often spliced  <cit> . studies in mice and human suggested that at least 13% and 26% of the unique full-length cdnas, respectively, are thought to be poly tail-containing long npcrnas  <cit> . emerging evidences also suggest that long npcrnas are developmentally regulated and responsive to external stimuli, and play roles in development and stress responses of plants and disease in human. for example, some long npcrnas are regulated in various stresses in plants and animals  <cit> . in caenorhabditis elegans,  <dig> npcrnas are either over- or under-expressed under heat shock or starvation conditions  <cit> , while in arabidopsis, the abundance of  <dig> putative long npcrnas are regulated by phosphate starvation, salt stress or water stress  <cit> . in arabidopsis, long npcrna, coolair , is cold-induced flc antisense transcripts, and has an early role in the epigenetic silencing of flc and to silence flc transcription transiently  <cit> . long npcrna hotair in human is reported to reprogram chromatin state to promote cancer metastasis  <cit> .

currently, two computational methods are employed to identify long npcrnas, genome-based and transcript-based. using genomic sequences, more than  <dig> candidate long npcrnas were predicted in escherichia coli  <cit> , and at least  <dig> long npcrna genes have been experimentally confirmed  <cit> . in rhizobium etli,  <dig> candidate npcrnas are detected by high-resolution tilling array, and  <dig> are classified as novel ones  <cit> . while using cdna or est sequences, a large number of long npcrnas are detected in drosophila, mouse and arabidopsis  <cit> .

up to date, identification of long npcrnas is limited to a few plant species, such as arabidopsis, rice and maize. to our best knowleage, in wheat no systematic identification of long npcrnas is reported. wheat  is the most widely grown crop plant, occupying 17% of all the cultivated land, provides approximately 55% of carbohydrates for world human consumption  <cit> , biotic and abiotic stresses are important limiting factors for yield and grain quality in wheat production. for instance, powdery mildew, caused by the obligate biotrophic fungus blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici , is one of the most devastating diseases of wheat in china and worldwide and causing significant yield losses  <cit> . high temperature, often combined with drought stress, causes yield loss and reduces the grain quality  <cit> . to reduce the damages caused by biotic and abiotic stresses, plants have evolved sophisticated adaptive response mechanisms to reprogram gene expression at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational levels  <cit> . recently, transcript profiling has been successfully employed to determine the transcriptional responses to powdery mildew infection and heat stress in wheat, and the results revealed that a number of genes were significantly induced or repressed in response to these stresses  <cit> .

in our previous study  <cit> , it was demonstrated that expression of micrornas in wheat was regulated by powdery mildew infection and heat stress, which stimulated us to explore whether long npcrna was also responsive to powdery mildew infection and/or heat stress. in this study, we performed a genome-wide in silico screening of powdery mildew infection and heat stress responsive wheat transcripts in order to isolate a collection of long npcrna genes. combining microarray analysis and high-throughput sbs sequencing methods, we totally characterized  <dig> putative stress responsive long npcrnas in wheat, four of them were mirna precursors, and one was experimentally verified by northern blot. wheat long npcrnas displayed tissue-specific expression patterns and their expression levels were altered in response to powdery mildew infection and/or heat stress, which suggested that at least a subset of these newly identified wheat long npcrnas potentially play roles in response to biotic and/or abiotic stresses in wheat.

RESULTS
identification of powdery mildew infection and heat stress responsive long npcrna candidates in wheat
in our previous study, a total of  <dig> powdery mildew infection and  <dig> heat stress responsive transcripts were obtained  through microarray analysis using the wheat affymetrix genechipÂ®. in this study, in order to identify the putative wheat long npcrnas which were responsive to powdery mildew and/or heat stress, these stress responsive transcripts were used to characterize the wheat long npcrnas. firstly, these transcripts were annotated by harvest program, and  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts were identified to be protein-coding genes and therefore were discarded in further analysis. the remaining transcripts were then analyzed by blastx and blastn,  <dig> and  <dig> ests with no similarity to protein coding genes or trna and rrna were retained. secondly,  <dig> transcripts with no or short orfs  and polya-tails were selected as putative long npcrnas , among which  <dig> were responsive to powdery mildew infection, and  <dig> were responsive to heat stress. we found that  <dig> long npcrnas responded to both powdery mildew infection and heat stress . a total of  <dig> putative long npcrnas were only responsive to powdery mildew infection , and  <dig> were only responsive to heat stress . among these putative long npcrnas, the longest orf was 74aa, with an average of  <dig> aa . in order to validate expression patterns of the long npcrnas in response to powdery mildew infection and/or heat stress, expression patterns of  <dig> long npcrnas, tapmlnrna <dig>  tapmlnrna <dig>  tahlnrna <dig> and talnrna <dig>  were determined by using quantitative rt-pcr analysis. expression levels of tapmlnrna <dig> and tapmlnrna <dig> were up-regulated after powdery mildew inoculation , whereas expression of tahlnrna <dig> and talnrna <dig> were up-regulated after heat stress , which showed consistent expression patterns with microarray analysis.

four long npcrna transcripts correspond to mirna precursors
by mapping mirnas which were identified from our previously sequenced six small rna libraries   <cit>  to the complete collection of  <dig> long npcrnas, we identified that four transcripts  were mirna precursors. prediction of the secondary structure for the four transcripts by using the vienna rna package rnafold web interface program showed that these four mirna precursors had stable hairpin structures .

among the four long npcrnas, three  were responsive to powdery mildew infection. both talnrna <dig> and tapmlnrna <dig> were the precursors of mir <dig>  and tapmlnrna <dig> was the precursor of mir <dig>  it is interesting to note that tapmlnrna <dig> and talnrna <dig> were up-regulated after powdery mildew infection as determined by qrt-pcr , and mir <dig> was also found to be up-regulated based on the small rna high throughput sequencing . to further determine the expression pattern of mir <dig>  we performed northern blot analysis  which indicated that mir <dig> shared similar expression pattern with the high throughput sequencing.

the heat responsive long npcrna tahlnrna <dig> contained ta-mir <dig> family sequences, and was up-regulated in 'tam107'   <dig> h after heat treatment , whereas ta-mir <dig> was also statistically up-regulated  <dig> h after heat stress in the small rna databases of 'tam107' in our previous study  <cit> . the secondary structure and the corresponding expression pattern indicated that tahlnrna <dig> might be the precursor of mir <dig>  in addition, the powdery mildew infection responsive long npcrna talnrna <dig>  was found to be also responsive to heat stress and the expression level was increased in 'cs' and 'tam107'  <dig> h after heat stress .

characterization of putative long npcrnas for sirna
we found that  <dig> out of  <dig> powdery mildew responsive long npcrnas gave rise to small rnas , and all of them had similar expression pattern in microarray analysis and sbs sequencing. most of these long npcrnas produced more than one small rna family. for example, tapmlnrna <dig> comprised three small rna family sequences and each had several members . the expression level of tapmlnrna <dig> in non-inoculated genotypes was quite low, but accumulated to a high level after powdery mildew infection in jd <dig> and jd8-pm <dig> 12hai . consistent with this expression pattern, its corresponding sirnas were also up-regulated after powdery mildew infection  in both genotypes.

for the heat stress responsive long npcrnas, there were nine transcripts matching the small rnas . among them, talnrna <dig> was responsive to both heat treated and powdery mildew inoculated wheat leaves, however, the expression pattern was quite different, expression of talnrna <dig> was repressed in jd <dig> and jd8-pm <dig> 12hai , but up-regulated after heat stress in 'cs' and 'tam107' . we also noted that talnrna <dig> accumulated to a much higher expression level  <dig> h after heat treatment in heat tolerant cultivar as compared to that in heat sensitive cultivar .

long npcrnas corresponding to srp and snornas
we found that  <dig> powdery mildew infection responsive and  <dig> heat stress responsive long npcrnas could execute their functions in the form of long molecules, among which  <dig> transcripts were responsive to both stress treatments . two transcripts, talnrna <dig> and talnrna <dig>  were identified as signal recognition particle  7s rna variant  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. it was found that the expression of talnrna <dig> was increased in both jd <dig> and jd8-pm <dig> genotypes  <dig> hours after infection  , but was repressed  <dig> h after heat treatment in 'cs'  and 'tam107'  . among the  <dig> long npcrnas which were only responsive to heat stress, three  were characterized as u <dig> snornas, and their expression levels were increased  <dig> h after heat stress in both 'cs' and 'tam107'

histone acetylation of talnrna <dig> and tapmlnrna19
the histone acetylation levels of talnrna <dig> and tapmlnrna <dig> were detected using antibody h3k <dig> by chip according to the procedure of lawrence  <cit> . chip analysis indicated that acetylation levels of talnrna <dig> and tapmlnrna <dig> in the inoculated jd <dig> and jd8-pm <dig> increased as compared to the non-inoculated controls .

small rnas might influence long npcrnas expression
based on our analysis, two srp 7s rna variants talnrna <dig> and talnrna <dig> could be regulated by  <dig> nt sirnas. there were five sirna families complementarily matching to the long npcrnas, among which, three groups  matched both talnrna <dig> and talnrna <dig>  and other two  were specific for talnrna <dig> . we designed gene specific primers  and amplified the antisense strand sequences of talnrna <dig> and talnrna <dig> . it was found that expression levels of talnrna <dig> and talnrna <dig> were up-regulated after powdery mildew inoculation in the two genotypes , whereas both of the antisense sequences were down-regulated after powdery mildew inoculation in the two genotypes , and negative correlation in expression levels was observed between sense strand and antisense strand expression patterns in both jd <dig> and jd8-pm <dig> . in addition, three long npcrnas, tapmlnrna <dig>  tapmlnrna <dig> and tapmlnrna <dig> also had several group small sequences matching them, and their expression patterns could be also regulated by sirnas.

wheat putative long npcrnas displayed tissue-specific expression patterns
to investigate the expression patterns of long npcrnas in different wheat tissues, qrt-pcr was performed in  <dig> wheat tissues using gene specific primer pairs , including leaf, internode, flag leaf, root, seed, awn, young spike and glume .

it was found that wheat long npcrnas displayed tissue-specific expression patterns. tapmlnrna <dig> was only detected in seed, whereas tapmlnrna <dig> accumulated preferentially in young spike . talnrna <dig> was expressed in all the tissues, but expression level was relatively higher in seed as compared to other tissues . talnrna <dig> was abundantly expressed in leaf, root and seed, no signal was detected in other tissues . interestingly, although both talnrna <dig> and tapmlnrna <dig> gave rise to mir <dig>  their expression patterns were obviously different . in addition, talnrna <dig> was expressed quite differently between leaf and flag leaf, and the transcripts accumulated predominantly in leaf .

experimentally verified full length cdna of predicted long npcrnas
in order to obtain the full length cdnas corresponding to the long npcrnas, we performed 5'race for four long npcrnas, including tapmlnrna <dig>  talnrna <dig>  tahlnrna <dig> and tahlnrna <dig>  the cdna from young leaf of jd <dig> was amplified by using gene specific primers  and sequenced. the full length cdnas corresponding to tapmlnrna <dig>  talnrna <dig>  tahlnrna <dig> and tahlnrna <dig> were  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp in length, respectively. the orfs of these sequences were searched by using orf finder program, and no orfs longer than 80aa was found in these full length cdnas . for example, tapmlnrna <dig> contained  <dig> putative orfs, but the longest orf was only 74aa .

discussion
wheat long npcrnas are not conserved among the plant species and responsive to both biotic and abiotic stresses
by using combination of microarray and sbs sequencing, a total of  <dig> putative long npcrnas were identified in wheat leaves using strict criteria across a collection of more than  <dig> powdery mildew and  <dig> heat stress responsive sequences. our analysis could fail to identify the bona fide long npcrnas in wheat due to the limited genomic information and gene annotation of wheat, however, these  <dig> putative long npcrnas constituted a reliable set of wheat long npcrnas. it must be pointed out that, in the absence of wheat whole genomic information and the full length sequences of these wheat long npcrnas, some of them might turn out to be protein-coding rnas when the wheat genomic sequences are available. however, this study represents the first attempt to characterize the wheat long npcrnas and their responses to biotic and/or abiotic stresses, which could provide a starting point for further investigation of long npcrnas in wheat.

as most non-protein coding rnas were subjected to a low degree of evolutionary constraint, we found that the  <dig> long npcrnas identified in this study had no homologs or significant matches out of plant, animal and microorganism kingdoms, and were wheat specific except for two srp 7srna variants  and  <dig> u <dig> snornas , which was in good agreement to the previous studies in other species such as drosophila, arabidopsis and mouse  <cit> . also, these long npcrnas did not appear to form large homologous family. this might suggest that during the evolution, wheat had developed a batch of specific long npcrnas to regulate gene expression and cell activity. further analysis revealed that long npcrnas in wheat had tissue-specific expression patterns, similar expression patterns of long npcrnas were also reported in other species  <cit> . in our investigation, even in leaf and flag leaf, talnrna <dig> was differentially expressed, which suggested that long npcrnas probably had much more precise expression regulation mechanisms. in addition, though talnrna <dig> and tapmlnrna <dig> gave rise to the same mirna, they displayed distinct expression patterns, indicating that mirna could potentially be produced by different precursors in different wheat tissues.

srp rna is an exception, as it is a ribonucleoprotein  that recognizes and targets specific proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes and the plasma membrane in prokaryotes. moreover, u <dig> snornas predominantly found in the nucleolus are thought to guide site-specific cleavage of ribosomal rna  during pre-rrna processing. therefore, they are thought to be conserved across three kingdoms.

it was reported that increased expression of either bc <dig> or an antisense transcript of the b-secretase- <dig>  gene had been implicated in the progression of alzheimer's disease  <cit> . ben et al  <cit>  found that abiotic stress altered the accumulation of  <dig> out of the  <dig> npcrnas. these indicated that long npcrnas had been linked to biotic and/or abiotic stresses, though in most instances, evidence had relied on differences in transcript expression levels between treated and non-treated samples. our analysis added further evidence for the responsiveness of long npcrnas to both biotic and/or abiotic stresses, since  <dig> wheat long npcrnas were responsive in defense against powdery mildew infection, and  <dig> were responsive to heat stress.

some of the wheat long npcrnas are small rna precursors
study showed that mir <dig> was derived from the long npcrna h <dig> which was endogenously expressed in human keratinocytes and neonatal mice  <cit> , and .npcrna <dig> gene contained the mir <dig> sequence in an alternative intron and corresponded to the mir162a locus  <cit> . the 'bic' noncoding rna that served as the precursor for mir <dig> was also readily detectable in vivo as full-length transcripts  <cit> . in our identified wheat long npcrnas, four transcripts  were characterized as putative mirna precursors. among them, tapmlnrna <dig>  tapmlnrna <dig> were specific to powdery mildew infection, while tahlnrna <dig> was only responsive to heat stress. increasing evidence indicated that mirnas played important roles in plant responses to biotic stresses  <cit> . after powdery mildew infection, talnrna <dig> and tapmlnrna <dig> were up-regulated 12hai in jd <dig> and jd8-pm <dig> genotypes, and their corresponding mir <dig> was also increased in abundance, which strongly indicated that these two long npcrnas were processed to mirnas to regulate wheat response to powdery mildew infection. however, as there were no significant expression differences between the nils jd <dig> and jd8-pm <dig>  we speculated that these two long npcrnas functioned as basal defense. to further confirm this hypothesis, talnrna <dig>  tapmlnrna <dig>  talnrna <dig> and tapmlnrna <dig> were analyzed using qrt-pcr in  <dig> hrs after-touched jd <dig> and jd8-pm <dig> as well as their controls, and their expression level had no differences between two treatments , which suggested that the expression alteration were caused by powdery mildew infection, not by touching.

in addition, we revealed that  <dig> wheat long npcrnas produced sirnas and  <dig> sequences could function in the form of long molecules involved in wheat resistance to powdery mildew infection and/or heat stressed. the collection of long npcrnas offered candidates for further analysis of this kind of npcrnas, which gained increasing attention in recent years  <cit> .

our analysis revealed that two srp 7s rna variants  as well as tapmlnrna <dig>  tapmlnrna <dig> and tapmlnrna <dig> could be regulated by sirnas. coram et al  <cit>  reported that the antisense strands of probe sets ta. <dig> and ta. <dig>  were expressed using wheat affymetrix genome array, which was in good agreement with our experimental results. and interestingly, our analysis also shown that the expression patterns of antisense had negative correlations with sense sequence for both talnrna <dig> and talnrna <dig>  which strongly indicated that the sirnas generated from antisense strands might regulate expression of their corresponding sense strands. collectively, this study indicated that expression of wheat long npcrnas might be regulated by other non-protein coding rnas, as was the case for xist gene  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, by using computational analysis and experimental approach, for the first time, we identified  <dig> putative wheat long npcrnas. these identified wheat long npcrnas were not conserved among plant species, and some of them were small rna precursors. wheat long npcrnas showed a tissue dependent expression patterns and their expressions were responsive to powdery mildew infection and/or heat stress, suggesting that they could play roles in development and regulation of biotic and/or abiotic stresses. our analysis also indicated that expressions of some wheat long npcrnas could be regulated by small rnas and through histone acetylation, but this need further investigation. the identification and expression analysis of wheat long npcrnas in this study would provide a starting point to understand their functions and regulatory mechanisms in the future.
