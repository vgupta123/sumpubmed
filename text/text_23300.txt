BACKGROUND
most gram-positive bacteria, such as bacillus anthracis, m. tuberculosis, staphylococcus aureus, and clostridiumtetani, are harmful. they cause a wide range of diseases in both immunocompetent and immunocompromized hosts. many of them can cause serious health problems in goats. these include mastitis, erysipelas, listeriosis, anthrax, encephalitis, and spontaneous abortion. toll-like receptors  are type i trans-membrane proteins. they are ligands of a large number of endogenous and exogenous targets. tlr <dig> is considered the main pattern receptor of various gram-positive bacteria—including mycobacteria, viruses, and their products  <cit> . tlr <dig> can form heterodimers with both tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  these heterodimers play a key role in innate immunity by binding pathogen-associated molecular patterns  and causing an inflammatory cascade reaction  <cit> . this activates monocytes and macrophages and promotes neutrophil infiltration  <cit> . the signalling pathway initiated by tlr <dig> is called the myeloid-differentiation-factor88-dependent pathway   <cit> . tlr <dig> is secreted in a wide variety of tissues and organs, but not all of them show the same levels of expression  <cit> . under challenge, tlr <dig> expression is up-regulated. this results in translocation of nuclear factor , which in turn causes the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin- <dig>  and nitric oxide . studies have shown that tlr <dig> acts as an agonist by modulating the immune response and th1/th <dig> balance  <cit> . il- <dig> is a pro-inflammatory cytokine. it is produced by th <dig> cells and acts as a mediator of acute phase response. it accelerates the infiltration of inflammatory cells. cytokines such as ifn-γ, which is produced by th <dig> cells, inhibit the differentiation of th <dig> cells. il- <dig>  an immune regulation cytokine produced by monocytes and macrophages, is crucial to th1/th <dig> balance  <cit> . several types of immune dysfunction can occur if this balance is disrupted. during pathogen infection, a healthy th1/th <dig> balance can facilitate an effective host response. lysozyme  is especially active against gram-positive bacteria. lysozyme breaks down the carbohydrate chains on their surfaces, destroying the structural integrity of the cell wall. the bacteria then burst under their own internal pressure.

synthetic bacterial lipopeptide pam3csk <dig> is a tlr <dig> agonist. it is a heterodimer of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  <cit> . tlr <dig> serves as the recognizing receptor for gram-positive bacteria. study showed tlr <dig> expression up-regulated under pam3csk <dig> challenge.

to determine the effect of over-expression of tlr <dig> on pathogen resistance, tlr <dig> transgenic goats were generated. pam3csk <dig> was used as a tlr <dig> activator. no, mda, and lzm products were detected and used to evaluate the immune response. further experiments were performed out to determine the effects of over-expression of tlr <dig> on the immune systems of goats both in vivo and in vitro. tissue sections were evaluated histological. the blood biochemical parameters of the experimental goats were characterized.

RESULTS
production of transgenic goats over-expressing capra hircustlr2
capra hircus tlr <dig> cdna was generated using rt-pcr. a  <dig> bp fragment was amplified. this fragment was linked to double-enzyme-digested p3s-loxp vector. two loxp sequences were introduced. an expression vector, p3s-loxp-tlr <dig>  was constructed . as shown in table  <dig>   <dig> pl of linearized plasmid was microinjected into  <dig> embryos in total, and these injected embryos were immediately transferred into  <dig> recipients, producing  <dig> goats. southern blot analysis confirmed that  <dig> of these goats were transgenic. the dose of  <dig> ng/μl was found to be more efficient than  <dig> ng/μl . real-time pcr analysis was performed to determine levels of tlr <dig> transcription. during the experiment, tlr <dig> expression in tg goats was higher than in control goats . the amount of tlr <dig> mrna in transgenic goats  was significantly higher than in wild-type goats  at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> hours . in tg, tlr <dig> transcription reached its peak  <dig> hours after challenge. immunohistochemical results confirmed that the tg group expressed more tlr <dig> than the wt group .

normal blood biochemical parameters of transgenic goats
there was no statistically significant difference between transgenic goats and non-transgenic goats with respect to routine blood and serum biochemical parameters at  <dig> days .


promotion of il- <dig> and il- <dig> expression in transgenic goats
under pam3csk <dig> stimulation, levels of secreted ifn-γ were significantly lower in the tg group than in the wt group at  <dig>  hours. during the experiment, ifn-γ expression was unregulated in tg, and this pattern remained relatively stable. peak ifn-γ expression was observed at  <dig> hours post stimulation in tg, which is earlier than in the wt group. the expression of ifn-γ in the wt group showed a fluctuating uptrend, including two points of up-regulation. the peak concentration of the wt group was observed  <dig> hours after stimulation. it was also higher than the peak concentration observed in the tg group. at  <dig> hours, il- <dig> levels were higher in the tg group than in the wt group . this may have caused an acute inflammatory response. in the tg group, il- <dig> expression reached its highest level at  <dig> hours and then became down-regulated .


in the wt group, ifn-γ levels increased during the first  <dig>  hours, but il- <dig> expression was up-regulated immediately. high levels of ifn-γ expression were observed  <dig> hours after challenge. in contrast, il- <dig> and il- <dig> expression decreased, and minimal levels of il- <dig> were observed. soon after that, il- <dig> expression increased again. this indicates that the inflammatory response was being suppressed.

in the tg group, there was an inflammatory imbalance between il- <dig> and il- <dig> when il- <dig> and ifn-γ levels peaked at  <dig> hours and subsequently decreased. this suggests that a strong inflammatory reaction occurred. the highest il- <dig> level was detected at  <dig> hours. this indicates that the inflammatory reaction was inhibited. these results suggest that over-expression of tlr <dig> might regulate the expression of th <dig> cytokines and trigger the inflammatory response.

prevention of oxidative damage in transgenic goats
in the immune response, no acts as a functional cellular signalling molecule. in macrophages, nitric oxide synthase  is positively regulated by ifn-γ. mda is one of the most frequently used indicators of lipid per-oxidation. in this study, the concentrations of no and mda in the wt group were higher than in the tg group at  <dig>  hours and  <dig> hours , and they remained relatively low and stable in the tg group .

up-regulation of lysozyme secretion in transgenic goats
lysozymes are small enzymes that attack the protective cell walls of bacteria. lysozymes break carbohydrate chains, destroying the structural integrity of the cell wall. lzm expression in the tg group was higher than in the wt group at  <dig>  hours , after which it showed a steady upward trend .

rapid filtration of inflammatory cells in transgenic goats
goats were intradermally injected with pam3csk <dig> in the ear. red blood cell infiltration was observed in both tg and wt groups in the dermal connective tissue  <dig>  hours after pam3csk <dig> challenge. eight hours after pam3csk <dig> challenge, dermal damage was assessed and serious red cell and inflammatory cell infiltration was observed in the wt group. however, no pathological changes were observed in the tg group  <dig> hours after treatment with pam3csk <dig> .


discussion
tlr <dig> is as a key player in the defence against organ damage and in innate immunity. it provides an important link between innate and adaptive immunity  <cit> . during bacterial infection, viral infection, host defence, allergic response, and transplant rejection, the th1/th <dig> cytokine balance is broken. the functional polymorphisms of tlr <dig> have been reported  <cit> . by binding with its ligand, tlr <dig> causes the activation of nf-κb, ultimately leading to the transcription of cytokines, chemokines, and co-stimulators. once tlr <dig> is activated, tlr2-mediated th <dig> responses are induced  <cit> . studies have shown that the tlr <dig> pathway directly triggers the production of th <dig> cytokines  <cit> . it has been reported that th <dig> cytokines tend to induce pro-inflammatory responses and th2-related cytokines, including il- <dig> and il- <dig>  tend to produce anti-inflammatory responses and can counteract the th1-mediated microbicidal actions  <cit> . in launching complex inflammatory reactions, il- <dig> plays a crucial role as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. high levels of il- <dig> can activate monocytes and macrophages  <cit> . il- <dig> is the main anti-inflammatory factor  <cit> .

during the onset of immune response, pro-inflammatory cytokines like il- <dig> play a dominant role. during later phases, anti-inflammatory cytokine expression increases to prevent immune overreaction  <cit> . ifn-γ can inhibit th <dig> cells and il- <dig> can decrease levels of th1-related cytokines, preventing the generation of monocyte-derived dcs  <cit> . changes in il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and ifn-γ levels reflect the relationship between anti- and pro-inflammatory equilibrium and immune function  <cit> . ifn-γ and il- <dig> expression was found to be up-regulated earlier in the tg group than in the wt group. as a consequence, levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine decreased to their original values faster in the tg group than in the wt group. our results indicate that pam3csk <dig> stimulation might cause immunosuppression in the wt group. tlr <dig> transcription levels were found to be positively correlated with il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and ifn-γ levels in the tg group. they were able to promote immune response. a slight up-regulation of il- <dig> was observed at  <dig>  hours post challenge. one reasonable explanation for this might be was negative self-regulation of the immune system. this regulation would reduce the intensity of cascade immune reactions, prevent monocyte- and macrophage-induced damage, and decrease the effects of the inflammatory responses that cause tissue damage. recent studies have revealed that tlr2−/− mice experienced strong immune reactions  <cit> . up-regulated expression of tlr <dig> in multiple organs was found to have a high mortality rate  <cit> . tlr <dig> was also found to induce neutrophil activation  <cit> . in the tg group, pam3csk4-induced cytokine imbalances were resolved, and cytokine levels returned to original levels within  <dig> hours. this was earlier than in the wt group. tissue sections showed that neutrophil activation enhanced rapid infiltration in tg animals. tissue damage attributable to severe inflammatory reaction was found to be inhibited by tlr <dig> over-expression.

no is produced by a variety of cells. it has many functions involved in the response to microbe invasion and inflammatory injury. during macrophage activation, large amounts of nos and super oxide anion radicals are released alongside no and h2o <dig>  the toxic effects of no on nearby tissue and of nos production on cells have been reported. studies have found that the damage to cellular proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids caused by oxidation can contribute to immune reactions involving tlr <dig>  <cit> . one previous study indicated that activation of nf-κb was remarkably enhanced by exposed to no in raw <dig>  cells  <cit> . the relatively low levels of no were able to trigger downstream pathways and keep the defence mechanism functioning properly. in contrast, the activation of nf-κb was inhibited by high concentrations of no  <cit> . the suppression of nf-κb activation decreased the inflammatory response and prevented tissue damage. our results indicate that tlr <dig> over-expression was correlated to stable no and mda levels and moderate levels of oxidative stress. recent reports have shown that lysozyme promotes the release of tlr <dig> stimulants from gram-positive organisms  <cit> . the results of the present study indicate that monocyte-macrophages were activated by pam3csk <dig> and that lysozyme secretion increased. lysozyme content was higher in the tg group than in the wt group. tlr <dig> over-expression was found to up-regulate lysozyme secretion and it may contribute to bacterial clearance.

CONCLUSIONS
goats over-expressing capra hircus tlr <dig> were not found to differ significantly from wild-type goats in any physiological or biochemical respect. among tg animals, il- <dig> levels were up-regulated and ifn-γ-induced immunity was depressed. no concentrations remained relatively low. enhancement of il- <dig> expression occurred earlier than in wild-type. inflammatory infiltrations and lysozyme secretion were increased. in vivo study indicated that the immune system responded quickly to protect tissue from damage. all of these results indicate that tissue damage can be prevented by over-expression of tlr <dig>  this information may be useful to fostering disease resistance in goat breeding.
