BACKGROUND
identifying polymorphic markers associated with complex, economically important traits in crops has been hindered for most crops by the lack of whole genomic sequence, high-resolution maps and cost-effective platforms for high-density genotyping. in soybean, several thousands of genetic markers  have been identified and mapped in the past ten years  <cit> . however, marker density is not enough to target candidate genes underlying a qtl region and conduct association mapping for complex traits. it was estimated that linkage disequilibrium extends for hundreds of kilobases in the cultivated soybean  group and that  <dig>  -  <dig>  snps would be necessary for whole genome associations in soybean  <cit> . therefore, large numbers of markers and cost-effective snp genotyping technology will make the whole-genome association analysis possible in soybean. a major limitation to the development of high throughput genotyping assays for soybean is the lack of snps covering the whole genome that can be used for genotyping. to date, approximately  <dig>  public snps developed from soybean unigenes are available to the public  <cit> . the 8x shotgun sequence assembly of the soybean cultivar "williams 82" has been released by the department of energy, joint genome institute after the  <dig> x scaffold assembly was initially released to the public http://www.phytozome.net/soybean. it provides an invaluable resource for soybean genome mapping and marker development  <cit> . although we can design primers to target most of the sequences based on the available genome sequence, it is not feasible to develop hundreds of markers by sequencing pcr products using the sanger method because it is costly, time consuming, and labor intensive  <cit> .

with the recent advances in massively parallel sequencing technologies and the availability of whole genome sequence, the identification of a large number of polymorphic markers by re-sequencing different genotypes in model species such as human  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit> , is changing the landscape of genetics, which can provide molecular genetic markers and insights into gene function  <cit> . the process of whole-genome re-sequencing using short-read technologies involves the alignment of millions of reads to a reference genome sequence and the determination of the variations in nucleotide sequence between the sample and the reference, based on statistics of multiple reads within an alignment. currently, large-scale identification of snps by massively parallel sequencing technology for crop species is still a challenging endeavor because of genome complexity and the cost for whole genome deep-coverage re-sequencing.

for large and complex genomes, the identification of snps by massively parallel sequencing technology has been explored using reduced complexity sequencing approaches. there are several methods which aim to reduce the complexity of the sequencing template, in particular, by reducing the representation of low-information-content repetitive sequences. one such method is expressed sequence tag  sequencing. for example, in the polyploid crop oilseed rape , snp discovery was exploited using solexa transcriptome sequencing by aligning ests to the reference sequences, a set of publicly available unigenes  <cit> . however, as gene expression has temporal and spatial changes, the sample preparation is more challenging for snp discovery because it requires the same set of ests generated from different genotypes that can be compared with each other. in addition, it is difficult to discriminate the orthologous sequences from paralogous sequences when working on a complex genome  <cit> , due to gene duplication. as a result of these est sequencing limitations mentioned above, the number of identified snps is relatively low in many species with validation rates usually between  <dig> and 85%  <cit> .

snp discovery for complex plant genomes by coupling the next-generation sequencing platform with a complexity reduction technique has been demonstrated in the crops  system  <cit> , which combines the  <dig> technology with the amplification fragment length polymorphism  technique. within the crops system, tagged complexity-reduced fragment libraries generated by the aflp process  <cit>  was sequenced by  <dig> highly parallel sequencing technology, and the sequences were aligned and mined for polymorphisms. the system was validated with a 75% validation rate in maize  <cit> . snp discovery by highly parallel sequencing was successfully demonstrated in cattle  <cit> , in which reduced-representation pooled libraries were sequenced using the illumina/solexa technology. alignment of the over five millions of 25-bp short reads to the bovine genome identified over  <dig>  putative snps with a 91% validation rate. it is demonstrated that high-throughput sequencing of complexity reduced genomes for snp discovery, with 8-20x sequence coverage, is a more efficient and effective way for the identification of large numbers of snps  <cit> . taking advantage of the low cost of the approach, researchers are now applying this technique in other species to develop genome-wide snp markers.

the feasibility of identifying snp markers for qtl fine mapping by high-throughput sequencing at a low sequencing depth depends on the false call rate, genome coverage, and sequencing cost. to identify snp markers in a cost effective way for fine-mapping of several qtl regions and determine the false call rate of putative snps at a low sequencing depth, we evaluated a pooled dna fragment reduced representation library and the snp detection method applied to short read sequences generated by solexa massively parallel sequencing technology.

RESULTS
test restriction digestions
based on in silico analysis results , the cvir i restriction enzyme showed to be the best one for construction of the reduced representation genomic dna library due to its more uniform size distribution of digested fragments, relative high number of fragments in the size range  as we expected  <cit> , and no major repetitive element peaks in the diagram showing the repetitive fragment percentage over the selected size range . to verify in silico digestion results we tested the real digestions of genomic dna of forrest, williams  <dig>  and pi  <dig>  with three enzymes  which produced the number of fragments more close to what we expected . it was shown that the restriction digestion for different genotypes by cvir i was much better than that by hae iii and rsa i.

library construction and quality control
the equally pooled dna sample of forrest and williams  <dig> was digested with cvir i and the fragments in the 70- <dig> bp size range were isolated from a polyacrylamide gel . the fragment library was constructed and  <dig>  Î¼g final products were obtained. to verify the quality of the library, a portion of the final dna products were cloned into a plasmid vector and randomly selected  <dig> clones for one direction sequencing on the abi  <dig> sequencer . then, these sequences were aligned to the soybean genome assembly. of the  <dig> good quality sequences,  <dig>  sequences were locus-specific,  <dig>  sequences had multiple hits in the genome, and  <dig>  sequences had no hit on the  <dig> x scaffold assembly.

dna sequencing and snp discovery
the pooled library was sequenced in two flow cells, totally generating over  <dig> million reads  corresponding to  <dig>  million unique 33-mer sequences, resulting in an average coverage of  <dig> x. however, the sequence clusters were seriously biased. it was shown that  <dig> % of the 33-mer sequences were just single read,  <dig> % of those had multiple reads, and  <dig> % of unique sequences were low quality sequences containing at least one unknown nucleotide 'n'. after removing  <dig>  low-quality sequences, over  <dig>  million 33-mer reads passed the standard illumina filtering and more than  <dig> million reads  could be aligned to the reference williams  <dig> genome sequence,  <dig> x scaffold assembly. finally,  <dig>  million sequences had a single read and  <dig>  million sequences with multiple reads remained for snp discovery. when plotting the depth-coverage of those sequences used for snp discovery over the chromosome coordinates, the distribution exhibited relatively uniform across the whole genome . however, we noticed that the distribution of read coverage was extremely biased , which revealed overdispersed gamma distribution  <cit> . in the sequences with multiple reads, 60% of them were sequences with  <dig> reads or less. the sequences with more than  <dig> reads was a small portion  but their sequence reads accounted for  <dig> % of the total reads of sequences with more than  <dig> reads. by analyzing sequence characteristics  and number of reads in a sliding window of  <dig> kbp in width, we found a correlation of read coverage and percentage of repetitive sequences in the  <dig>  million sequences with multiple reads. the result showed that  <dig> % of the sequences with more than  <dig> reads were located in repetitive regions, but only 36% of sequences with less than  <dig> reads were repetitive . there was no correlation between depth-coverage and gc-bias .

to clearly evaluate the feasibility of snp discovery using solexa high-throughput sequencing, two different levels of stringency  were initially used for snp prediction and filtering. the less stringent parameters identified  <dig>  putative snps between the solexa short-reads and the  <dig> x assembly with an average snp density of  <dig>  kbp across the entire genome, which were not uniformly distributed across soybean chromosomes, especially more snps were clustered in gene-rich, high-recombination euchromatic regions than in repeat-rich, low-recombination heterochromatic regions . the number of the predicted snps was not evenly distributed over the 33-mer positions . the highly stringent filtering method predicted  <dig>  putative snps on the  <dig> x scaffold assembly, which were further analyzed against the newly released williams  <dig> soybean genome sequence, 8x scaffold assembly. we aligned the original short-read sequences containing the putative snps onto the 8x scaffold assembly using blastn and excluded snps which had more than one position in the genome. we also identified the repeat sequences in the 8x scaffold assembly using repeatmasker http://repeatmasker.org and aligned the original short-read sequences containing the putative snps onto the repeat masked scaffold assembly. snps which short-read sequences could not be aligned to the repeat-masked genome sequence were also excluded. it indicated that these snps might be in the repetitive regions in the genome or they failed to align to the 8x scaffold assembly due to some sequence changes from the  <dig> x scaffold assembly.

finally,  <dig>  snps were identified after filtering with the highly stringent criteria as well as aligning onto the 8x scaffold assembly . some of the snps were also examined by loading the alignments of short-reads into maqview http://maq.sourceforge.net/maqview.shtml for visualization . the flanking  <dig> bp sequences around the snp position were extracted for the snp array design.

snp validation
to evaluate stringency parameter sets for snp prediction and the feasibility of this snp discovery approach for fine mapping, , we deliberately selected predicted snps for validation from the list of  <dig>  putative snps predicted on the  <dig> x scaffold assembly, and then applied more strict parameters for snp calling to see how the stringency setting would affect the validation rate. we selected an  <dig> cm qtl region associated with soybean cyst nematode resistance in chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . this qtl was in a repeat-poor, gene-rich euchromatic genomic region, which had only  <dig> % repetitive sequence, while the soybean genome is made of ~59% repetitive elements  <cit> . a total of  <dig> putative snps  were predicted in the  <dig> cm qtl region, we selected  <dig> snps with at least  <dig> kb intervals for validation, the flanking sequences derived from the  <dig> x scaffold sequence were used for primer design, generating 400- <dig> bp amplicons for resequencing by sanger method. out of  <dig> pcr amplicons, eight primer sets failed to amplify clear pcr product. ten primer sets amplified multiple products that caused the sequencing reads to be noisy. thus,  <dig> primer sets generated good quality of sequences both for forrest and williams  <dig>  by aligning the sequences of the two genotypes, of the  <dig> sequence tagged sites  containing the predicted snps,  <dig> stss containing the putative snps were validated, which resulted in a 72% validation rate.

validation rate is important for high throughput snp genotyping. to increase the validation rate, we set up more stringent parameters for snp calling as mentioned above. out of the  <dig> primer pairs that produced a good quality amplicon, only  <dig> were remained in the final list of  <dig>  snps predicted with higher stringency. according to the validation data,  <dig> of the  <dig> produced amplicons containing the predicted snp, which led to an 85% validation rate. we noticed that  <dig> of the  <dig> primer pairs initially selected were filtered out mostly due to the number of sequence reads low than  <dig> and potential multiple locations in the genome, but still having a  <dig> %  validation rate. the validation rates in different scenarios provided a useful guideline for snp predictions and selection of snps for different applications.

discussion
fine-mapping multiple targeted qtl regions requires a large number of molecular markers that could be used to narrow down the regions and pinpoint candidate genes or target markers associated more closely with traits. our objective was to design a solid experiment to test whether we could develop 50- <dig> markers within any targeted qtl region  using high-throughput sequencing technology. our results indicated that massively parallel sequencing technologies could offer an opportunity for simultaneously developing large numbers of high quality snps within target mapping populations. these snps could serve to fine-map the qtls that were identified in qtl mapping studies or to conduct association mapping. especially, with the improvements in sequencing output, paired-end reads and multiplexing techniques, the massively parallel sequencing technologies makes the whole genome snp discovery more effective and efficient.

in theory, any genome complexity reduction strategies could be applied to generate less complex genomic dna libraries for high-throughput sequencing. especially for complex genomes such as maize, wheat, barley and soybean, genome complexity reduction is an important step so that genome-wide polymorphism discovery would become successful in organisms with high levels of repetitive dna in the genome and/or low levels of polymorphism in breeding germplasm. compared to methylation complexity reduction approach, restriction enzyme-based methods may be more appropriate for snp discovery, because most of the short fragments generated by restriction enzymes from different genotypes would have a perfect alignment. the complexity reduction approach can be optimized by identifying an appropriate restriction enzymes using in silico digests of a draft genome sequence and test digest. our results indicated that cvir i was the best enzyme for soybean. of course, selection of one or multiple restriction enzymes for reduced representation library also relies on genome features in a given organism and applications. for example, hae iii was used for construction of bovine reduced representation libraries for deep sequencing by the solexa platform  <cit> . recently, five restriction enzymes were used for construction of a reduced representation library in a wild soybean  for snp discovery to help soybean sequence assembling  <cit> .

the pooling of dna samples from the parental lines for the target population, combined with the high-throughput sequencing of a small fraction of the genome results in the identification of a large number of snps genome wide. most importantly, this approach also allows us to develop a large number of snp markers for less well characterized species in an efficient and cost-effective way. especially, with the increase of the output of highly parallel sequences and the decrease of the cost per run, it is more feasible to get deep sequences for multiple individual genotypes or pooled samples. however, due to a few drawbacks of pooling the dna samples, the pooling strategy may not be necessary for sample preparation for duplicated genomes. for duplicate genomes such as soybean and maize, a portion of putative snps are derived from the alignment of paralogous sequences, i.e. the sequences aligned may come from different loci that are duplicated through evolution in the genome. the 85% snp validation rate in our pooled sample, even at a high stringency level, indicated that 'paralogous' snp is a problem for pooled samples. but it can be overcome by using a barcoding technique. it is not a problem to sequence many samples in a solexa instrument run if using a barcoding technique. it is becoming a standard approach to increase the number of samples run on high-throughput instruments  <cit> .

comparing to the current solexa sequencing system, our sequencing data were limited in terms of sequence length, accuracy  and output because the super-high throughput solexa sequencing system was not available when we conducted this experiment. therefore, the depth-coverage of the short sequence reads was not enough to take account of allele frequency in snp calling  <cit> . paired-end reads definitely increase the power to detect sequence variations and improve the placement of most short reads to the genome which would dramatically reduce errors of snp prediction caused by sequencing and misplacement of short reads  <cit> .

in addition, the short reads cannot be assembled to give complete sequence of complex plant genomes  <cit>  and repeat sequences cannot be aligned unambiguously with the reference genome  <cit> . for example, approximately  <dig> % of the sequence reads cannot be aligned unambiguously with the williams  <dig> genome, despite that the williams  <dig> genome sequence, 8x scaffold assembly, had 97% of genome sequenced. this portion of sequences may be unique in forrest but not present in williams  <dig>  or in the gaps of the assembly. if some of them came from exons, they must be unique genes that may serve as causative variations for some traits. some novel technologies that produce longer and paired-end sequences can improve snp calling and facilitate the identification of indel markers by massively parallel sequencing technologies  <cit> . in addition, it was demonstrated that using quality score and longer reads can improve accuracy of solexa sequence mapping to the reference genome  <cit> .

we noticed that the threshold settings were important for snp prediction. the more stringent thresholds gave a higher validation rate. but we had to balance the number of predicted snps that could be used for fine mapping and the validation rates. we may also take account of the snp distribution along the 33-mer solexa sequence positions , especially snps occurring in the first few nucleotides of short-reads might be overrepresented with a high percentage of predicted snps. however, further analyses are needed to validate these snps over different positions in the 33-mer sequences for fine-turning the filtering parameters used for snp prediction.

to explain potential causes of the observed sequence biases, a comprehensive analysis of the solexa sequencing procedures and effects of sequence characteristics is necessary. we did observe a strong correlation between percentage of repetitive sequences and read coverage, with the read density being increased in repetitive regions. however, we did not observe a correlation between gc content and read coverage, which is known to be present in solexa sequencing dna samples prepared by nebulization or sonication  <cit> . such biases have implications on the utilization and interpretation of solexa sequencing data for the identification of snps and transcriptome profile analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
massively parallel sequencing technologies enabled us to generate a large amount of sequences in the complex genome - soybean, which allowed us to identify many snps in qtl regions of interest. we have demonstrated an efficient and economical way to develop snp markers for qtl fine-mapping and provided a guideline for methods used in preparing complexity-reduced genomic dna sequencing samples and selecting parameters for sequence data filtering and snp prediction. we have applied this approach to fine-mapping multiple qtls related to soybean cyst nematode resistance, and constructing a high resolution of genetic map.
