BACKGROUND
it is a long-standing problem in cancer treatment that drugs often have heterogeneous responses and show sensitivity in subsets of patient cohorts  <cit> . the diverse genomics instability is believed to be responsible for the heterogeneity of drug response  <cit> . two large-scale datasets, i.e., the cancer cell line encyclopedia   <cit>  and genomics of drug sensitivity in cancer   <cit> , have recently been released independently to study the causal relationship between hundreds of drugs' sensitivity and genomics aberrations of  <dig>  cancer cell lines. on the other hand, the cancer genome atlas   <cit>  project profiles the genomics of about  <dig>  patient samples across over  <dig> cancer types. the integrative analysis indicated multiple subtypes of cancers with complex genomics characteristics, e.g., breast cancer  <cit> , squamous cell lung cancer  <cit> , and uterine cancer  <cit> . usually, mrna data from rna sequencing and microarrays  <cit>  and somatic copy number alterations  or genetic mutation were used to conduct the subtyping analysis by comparing the difference among cancer samples  <cit> . however, subtyping analyses often have complex genomics signatures, and thus failed to offer insight into drug sensitivity and to identify the predictive driver mutations.

in this paper, we present a new integrative approach to circumvent this problem by dividing cancer patients into clinically relevant subtypes based on comparing differentially expressed genes  with the normal  and uncover driver mutation modules  of individual subtypes based on the network analysis. our hypotheses are that: 1) distinct and mutual mutations in a network module can cause the same dysfunctional signaling pathways, and 2) the dysfunctional signaling pathways are indicated by degs. the mutual mutation module is necessary for cancer and taken advantage of the low frequency of individual mutations  <cit> . another advantage of using the ranking of degs is that the subtypes sharing the common degs also have higher possibility sharing the effective drugs. drug repositioning  <cit> , drug combinations  <cit>  and mechanism of action  delineation  <cit>  based on reverse differential gene expression profiling are becoming popular and important drug discovery studies, and are accelerated means to find new indications of existing drugs  <cit> .

RESULTS
methodology overview
breast cancer stratification
 <dig>  breast cancer patients' and  <dig> normal subjects' mrna profiles, as well as their corresponding mutation profiles are downloaded. with the stratification strategy, as shown in figure  <dig>  four subtypes of brca were obtained with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> patients respectively. the p-value,  <dig> , shows the significant difference of survival among the four subtypes, which partially indicates the clinical relevance of the subtypes. surprisingly, all patients of subtype  <dig>  survived during the study period , whereas the subtype  <dig>  had a poor prognosis.

to discover the underlying driver mutations, the mutation data from dna sequencing was extracted. for each subtype, the top ten high-frequency mutations, which include genes mutated in more than 10% of patients of each subtype, are shown in figure 3-left panel. the column label of the heat map is the patient sample id, and the red color in the heat map represents mutation detected in the corresponding sample, and the gray color indicates that a gene has no mutation in the corresponding sample. subtype- <dig> has only a few mutations and has the best prognosis outcomes. on the other hand, both tp <dig> and pik3ca mutations are top ranked in subtype- <dig>  which might explain the poor prognosis. the top ranked mutations are further connected into network modules, as shown in figure 3-right panel. different genes were involved in the driver mutation network for individual subtypes, and they are linked via one or two connection genes. these driver mutation modules offer insight into the dysfunctional modules that regulate the prognosis and drug responses.

adjusted survival analysis of lung cancer
we fitted the survival curves of lung cancer using cox regression model and found the important characteristics that have significant impact on the prognosis and survival from the clinical information of lung cancer in tcga. we found that, for lung cancer, "the history of other malignancy" and "ajcc pathologic tumor stage" are the important factors. figure  <dig> shows the adjusted survival curves of lung cancer after fitting in the cox model. we can see that the survival curves after adjustment also have only small changes compared with original survival curves.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
cancer is a complex disease, and individual cancer patients often have heterogeneous genomics instability such that anti-cancer drugs often have profound sensitivity in a subset of patients bearing the same genomic mutation modules. though large-scale genomics profiling data of individual patients are now available, the genomic mutation modules that regulate drug responses remain mostly unknown. effective computational methods to mine and extract the knowledge from the large-scale genomics datasets are needed urgently.

motivated by the successful drug repositioning and discovery of drug mechanism of action by using reverse gene expression profiling, this study presented an integrative computational method to stratify cancer patients into potential clinical correlated subtypes and identify the underlying driver mutation modules that are responsible for the drug sensitivity. the evaluation results on two major types of cancer  reveal subtypes with significant survival time difference and distinct driver mutations of individual subtypes. the proposed method opens up a new paradigm of cancer stratification. more importantly, it uncovers the underlying driver mutation modules , which might be used to find effective drugs that directly target the mutations or block the downstream signaling of the mutation modules. in future work, we will refine the mutation network modules, and discover synergistic drug combinations blocking the alternative downstream signaling of the mutation network modules, and test the predicted drug combinations on cell lines bearing the same mutation network modules.

data and methodology
personal genomics data
the mrna and mutation data from rna/dna sequencing, and clinical data  of breast invasive carcinoma , lung adenocarcinoma , as well as the corresponding normal samples, were obtained from tcga data portal. in total, there are  <dig>  mrna tumor samples ,  <dig>  mutation samples of brca;  <dig> mrna tumor samples ,  <dig> mutation samples of luad.

ranking of differentially expressed genes
we use the rnaseqv <dig> data of breast cancer and lung cancer in tcga portal. we fitted the individual genes of the normal samples into gaussian distribution and estimated the normal mean and standard variation by maximum likelihood estimation. then we calculated the cdf  of the individual genes of each tumor sample in the fitted gaussian distribution which is the p-value that indicates the significant difference between the tumor sample and the normal samples. the larger value of cdf of one tumor sample gene, the more up-regulated of this tumor sample gene, and vice versa. then we ranked the genes in each patient based on the p-values, which list the genes from the most up-regulated to the most down-regulated. we called it the ranked gene list for each patient which can be used to calculate the distance between any two patients.

calculation of patient genomics distance
the distance between patient a and patient b is determined by the assessment of how similar the two patients' ranked gene lists are. we selected the  <dig> most up-regulated genes and  <dig> most down-regulated genes in patient a as the signature, and qualified the distribution of this signature in the ranked gene list of patient b, and vice versa. as for the problem of selecting the best number of up/down regulated genes for the clustering analysis, we tested a series number of up/down genes as  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> respectively. in general, the clustering results are stable to the number of genes, and then we select  <dig> up/down regulated genes empirically. we conducted the gene set enrichment analysis   <cit>  using patient a's signature and patient b's ranked gene list, and vice versa as followed. for patient a, we got the enrichment scores of  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes with respect to the ranked gene list of patient b, defined as esbup and esbdown. the total enrichment score  of patient a with respect to patient b is defined as follows:

 tesa,b=1-esbup-esbdown <dig> 

the tesa,b quantifies the genomics variation difference between patients a and b. then the distance measurement among patients is defined as: da,b=tesa,b+tesb,a <dig>  which is the corresponding element in the genomics distance matrix m.

clustering analysis
the hierarchical clustering method  <cit>  was employed. after we calculated the distance between every two patients, we got the distance matrix m of n*n, where n is the number of the patient. the distance matrix is used to generate the dissimilarly structure. the cluster method was set as the 'complete linkage' method that tends to find similar clusters.

survival analysis
the survival analysis was conducted by using the 'survival' package in r  <cit> . it uses the cox-proportional hazards model to calculate the patient survival in each subtype using clustering analysis. an associated p-value is calculated to determine the significance of difference among each subtype's survival curve. the patients' 'vital status,' 'last contact day,' and 'death days' were extracted from clinical data of samples downloaded from tcga.

driver mutation module discovery
the ppi data was obtained from biogrid database  <cit> . it is a widely used ppi database. for the patients in each subtype of one cancer, we select the top  <dig> genes based on their mutated frequency and mapped them to the ppi network. an optimal connected sub-network was found for each subtype by solving steiner tree problem. let g be the background ppi network and vm be the list of top mutated genes. the shortest path for each pair of genes in vm was calculated using dijkstra's algorithm  <cit> , which is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem. we use this algorithm to find the shortest path between each pair of the top mutated genes, and then find the minimum spanning tree of the integrated network include all the top mutated genes and their paths as followed. the pairwise distance was calculated and denoted by d=. a complete network, kvm, was generated with nodes in vm. then dij was assigned as the edge weight of ∈e. the minimum spanning tree of kvm, tvm, was calculated. we replaced each edge in tvm with the shortest path between the two end nodes. the genes in the final network were considered as the marker of the subtype.
