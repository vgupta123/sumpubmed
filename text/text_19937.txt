BACKGROUND
cotton  fiber is the most important natural fiber in the textile industry  <cit> . physical properties such as strength, length, maturity , and fineness determine the value and quality of cotton fibers and the yarn spun from them. with the advent of modern high speed spinning machinery, which produces a quality yarn in a cost effective way, the demand for stronger fiber has increased in the highly competitive global textile market. during the past  <dig> decades, the fiber strength of us cotton has gradually improved through breeding  <cit> , however, the pace of improvement is restricted by our limited knowledge of fiber strength development.

both cotton producers and processers usually measure fiber strength from a bundle composed of thousands of individual fibers. the strength simply refers to the force required to break fibers  <cit> . the bundle fiber strength , which is also called fiber tenacity, is measured by an automated high-volume instrument  designed to measure the market value of cotton fibers in efficient and rapid ways. currently, the agricultural marketing service  of the united states department of agriculture  separates cotton fibers into different classes ranging from the lowest  to the highest class  based on the bfs values measured by the hvi. a stelometer is used to measure the bfs value for a relatively small amount of fibers . due to the inherent variability among fibers within a bundle, two fiber bundles of the same weight do not have the same number of fibers. thus, the actual bfs is determined in grams per tex  in which the breaking force  is standardized by the linear density or fineness . hence, high bfs  is obtained by either increasing the breaking force  or deceasing the fineness value .

the cotton industry has been using fiber properties determined by the hvi and advanced fiber information system  as parameters for predicting yarn quality and selecting the right raw cotton materials to produce different qualities of yarns. however, several textile papers have reported that the bfs data of cotton fibers were inadequate to predict yarn strength due to insignificant correlation between the cotton bfs and the yarn strength  <cit> . the bfs values are regulated by intrinsic fiber strength and other fiber properties which affect fiber-to-fiber interactions within a bundle . fiber length values that promote fiber interactions within a bundle impact the bfs values  <cit> . fiber thickness-related properties including micronaire , maturity ratio , and fineness values  also affect bundle strength of cotton fibers since they determine the number of individual fibers in a fiber bundle  <cit> .

the intrinsic fiber breaking force value is correlated with yarn strength and can be measured from individual fibers by mantis or favimat instruments  <cit> . average breaking force  obtained from several hundred individual fibers was not affected by other bundle fiber properties and was reported as one of the most important factors in determining the strength of the yarn spun from those fibers  <cit> . despite the usefulness of the individual fiber properties, the mantis and favimat instruments, which require laborious processes, have not been previously utilized in cotton genetics and genomics research.

gossypium hirsutum germplasm nils, md52ne and md90ne were developed through backcross breeding  <cit> . md90ne is the recurrent parent and md52ne is a bc <dig> high-bfs selection. md52ne contains 10 % higher bfs values, 22 % less short fibers, and 7 % greater fiber length than its nil, md90ne  <cit> . the stronger bfs trait of md52ne was suggested to be controlled by a small number  of genes  <cit> . by using the prototype of cotton oligonucleotide microarray chips that was developed from cotton expressed sequence tags   <cit> , we previously observed a temporal up-regulation of secondary cell wall  biogenesis genes in md52ne fiber at the transition from fiber elongation to secondary cell wall  biosynthesis as compared with md90ne  <cit> . another group also suggested that scw biogenesis-related genes might contribute to the fiber strength of g. hirsutum chromosome introgression lines  carrying chromosomal segments from g. barbadense whose fibers are longer, stronger, and finer than their recurrent parent g. hirsutum tm- <dig>  <cit> . the g. hirsutum csils were used for identifying potential genes responsible for fiber length  <cit>  in addition to fiber strength  <cit> . since the fiber length and fineness affecting fiber-to-fiber interactions within a bundle can modulate the bfs values of the cotton nils  <cit>  and csils  <cit> , it is not clear if the scw biogenesis-related genes are involved in regulating individual fiber breaking force and/or other bundle fiber properties. indeed, the same scw biogenesis-related genes were identified as differentially expressed genes  that may be involved in molecular mechanisms of controlling fiber length  <cit>  and fiber thickness-related properties  <cit>  in addition to the bfs  <cit> . therefore, it remains to be answered which candidate genes are really involved in individual fiber breaking force and therefore yarn strength.

in this research, we measured fiber properties of mature and developing fibers of md52ne, md90ne, and their f <dig> progenies using both novel and conventional methods including favimat, cross-section image analysis microscopy, attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy , hvi, stelometer, afis, and gravimetric fineness methods. the extended fiber property analyses showed that the superior bfs of md52ne fibers resulted primarily from a higher individual fiber breaking force with a minor contribution from increased fiber length. comparative transcriptome analyses of the nils suggested that the superior bfs of md52ne fibers was potentially related to ethylene pathway-directed fiber elongation and enhanced cell wall integrity due to the activity of receptor-like kinase  signaling pathways.

RESULTS
comparisons of bundle fiber properties between mature md52ne and md90ne fibers
fiber property analysis by hvi showed that the bfs of mature md52ne fibers was significantly greater  than that of md90ne fibers grown in two separate fields that substantially differ in geographic location and environmental conditions . in addition, upper half mean length  of the md52ne fiber was longer . average fiber elongation values of md52ne were lower than those of md90ne but was only statistical significant at one location. no significant differences in the mic values were observed between the md52ne and md90ne grown in both locations.table  <dig> comparisons of hvi bundle fiber properties between md52ne and md90ne

correlation of bundle fiber strength with other fiber properties
to determine how the bfs values of the nils were affected by other physical properties involved in fiber-to-fiber interactions, we developed an f <dig> population of  <dig> progeny plants derived from a cross between md52ne and md90ne. among the f <dig> progenies, the bfs values showed a gaussian distribution with a broad range  . other fiber properties including uhml length , elongation , mic , maturity ratio , and fineness  measured by hvi and afis showed gaussian distributions among the f <dig> progenies so we were able to determine correlations of the bfs with other fiber physical properties.fig.  <dig> fiber property analyses of nils and their f <dig> progeny. a frequency distribution of bundle fiber strength in an f <dig> population from a cross between md90ne and md52ne. average bundle strength value of each f <dig> progeny was obtained from five replicates by hvi. minimum, median , and maximum bundle fiber strengths were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  g/tex among 384 f <dig> progenies. b comparisons of breaking force distributions of individual fibers from md52ne and md90ne fibers. breaking forces  of  <dig> individual fibers were determined from mature md52ne and md90ne fibers having similar fiber maturity with an identical mic value . a 13 mm length gauge was used for breaking fiber with favimat instrument

comparisons of individual fiber properties between mature md52n and md90ne fibers
to minimize the influences of other physical fiber properties on fiber strength, we first screened for the nil plants that had similar fiber properties except the bfs values. among the selected nil plants having a significant variation  of bfs values, we identified each cotton md52ne and md90ne line having an almost identical mic value  representing a combination of fiber maturity ratio and fineness. the fiber properties measured by afis in addition to the hvi confirmed that there was no significant variation in the fiber thickness-related properties  but a significant difference  in fiber length between the selected nils . the average breaking force of individual md52ne fibers was significantly greater  than that of individual md90ne fibers . the distribution curves showed great variation of breaking forces among individual fibers of each nil and a similar distribution range of breaking force between the individual md52ne fibers  and md90ne fibers  . stronger fibers with higher cn values were more prevalent in md52ne than md90ne.table  <dig> comparisons of bundle and individual fiber properties between mature md52ne and md90ne fibers having identical mic value

comparisons of fiber properties between developing md52ne and md90ne fibers
to determine when variations of fiber properties occurred during cotton fiber development between the two nils, we measured fiber physical properties from developing fibers at ten different developmental time points  covering entire developmental stages . the growth rates of actively elongating md52ne and md90ne fibers declined at  <dig> dpa . statistical analyses using t test showed no significant variances on the average lengths of the developing fibers younger than  <dig> dpa between the nils. average fiber lengths of developing md52ne fibers at  <dig> dpa and older were significantly longer  than those of developing md90ne fibers at the corresponding time points. at around  <dig> dpa, fibers entered a transition phase with both scw cellulose biosynthesis and fiber elongation . crystallinities of developing md52ne and md90ne fibers were measured by an atr-ftir spectroscopy and its corresponding algorithm  <cit> . the comparative plot showed low crystallinity  of the developing fibers between  <dig> and  <dig> dpa. the ciir values increased rapidly to  <dig> dpa, and reached its peak at  <dig> dpa . the observation implied that the developing fibers at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpa were composed of mainly primary cell wall  containing a low crystallinity and the transition from elongation to scw biosynthesis occurred from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa. scw containing a high crystallinity was deposited on the developing fibers until  <dig> dpa of both nils. there was no statistically significant difference in the ciir values of developing fibers between the two nils during the entirety of the developmental stages . the bolls became fully developed and began to open at approximately  <dig> dpa. the mature fibers dehisced at  <dig> dpa. fiber maturity ratio or degree of wall thickness  was also assessed from developing md52ne and md90ne fibers by atr-ftir spectra   <cit> . the developing fibers at  <dig> dpa and younger showed little of the scw cellulose that is mainly responsible for fiber maturity  <cit> . the mir values revealed that the developing fibers at  <dig> dpa and older consisted of scw cellulose. during the scw biosynthesis stage  of both nil fibers, the mir values increased likewise . cross-sectioned images of fully mature md 52ne and 90ne fibers and their calculated mr showed similarities between the nils . the increasing pattern of fineness values  of developing md52ne fibers from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa was almost identical to that  of developing md90ne fibers at the corresponding time points . developing md52ne fibers at  <dig> dpa and older were significantly  stronger than developing md90ne fibers at the corresponding dpas . when the developing fibers reached  <dig> dpa, the bfs differences were clearly detected between md52ne  and md90ne . a stelometer, which requires relatively less fiber than the hvi, was used for measuring bundle strength of developing fibers. neither the stelometer nor the hvi could measure bfs values from developing fibers that were younger than  <dig> dpa, because the sugary and sticky developing fibers cannot be individualized.fig.  <dig> comparisons of fiber properties from developing md52ne and md90ne fibers. developing fibers at nine different developmental time points  and full developed fibers at  <dig> dpa were collected from nils grown side by side in replicated fields in new orleans, la in  <dig>  asterisks next to the time points denote statistical significance. a fiber length. average lengths of developing fibers at different dpas were calculated from  <dig> replicates. b crystallinity. average crystallinity  was determined from six replicates of atr-ftir spectra. c maturity. average fiber maturity  was determined from six replicates using atr-ftir. d fineness. three hundred fibers of 15 mm length were used for each replicate of gravimetric fineness analyses. average fineness values were calculated from three replicates. e bundle fiber strength. average bundle fiber strength of developing fibers was measured from three replicates by stelometer

transcriptome analysis of developing fibers between md52ne and md90ne by rna-seq
to investigate the molecular basis for the superior fiber strength of md52ne to md90ne, whole genome comparative transcriptome analyses were performed with total rnas extracted from developing fibers between md52ne and md90ne. based on the fiber property data obtained from developing fibers , two different developmental time points,  <dig> dpa containing mainly pcw and  <dig> dpa containing both pcw and scw, were compared between the nils with two biological replicates.

the average number of raw reads per library obtained by paired-end illumina sequencing ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , <dig>  reads . the numbers of average raw reads were slightly higher in md52ne in both time points than md90ne. of the raw reads,  <dig>  to  <dig>  % of reads per library were mapped to annotated protein coding genes in the draft genome g. hirsutum, tm- <dig>  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  genes were mapped in this upland cotton genome for all four libraries . expressed genes were annotated with arabidopsis tair  <dig> homeolog genes. the percentages of genes having reads per kilo-base per million reads  > <dig> were ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % per library. we selected an rpkm threshold of  <dig> to be consistent with prior work using this draft genome  <cit> .table  <dig> summary of total raw and clean sequence tags



expressed mapped genes were further evaluated between two nils using rpkm values for the respective time points. the false discovery rate  was set at 5 % to determine the threshold of p value in multiple tests and analyses. to judge the significance of gene expression difference, adjusted p ≤  <dig>  and the absolute value of log <dig> ratio ≥  <dig> was used as the threshold  <cit> . of the  <dig>  expressed genes,  <dig> and  <dig> unique genes were significantly differentially expressed at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa, respectively between the nils . of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes ,  <dig> and  <dig> unique genes were expressed as up- and down-regulated in md52ne at  <dig> dpa respectively, while out of  <dig> genes,  <dig> and  <dig> degs were expressed up- and down-regulated in md52ne at  <dig> dpa, respectively .fig.  <dig> summary of rna-seq analysis comparing md52ne and md90ne. a venn diagrams representing differentially expressed genes  at two developmental stages  in md52ne and md90ne fibers. b comparisons of up- or down-regulated degs at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa in md52ne fibers. c go analysis. singular enrichment analysis was used to identify go categories that were commonly found at both  <dig> and  <dig> dpa developing fibers from md52ne. the color and numbers adjacent to the go identifier represent p-values

go enrichment analysis of the annotated degs by agrigo  <cit>  showed that the degs involved in responses to stimuli and phytohormones, intracellular signaling, cellular metabolic process, cell wall modification, lipid localization, and carbohydrate metabolic process were commonly identified in developing md52ne fibers at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa . numerous transcription factors regulated by growth stimulating phytohormones such as auxin, ethylene, and gibberellins  were differentially expressed in developing md52ne fibers . among them, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase  <dig>  and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase  <dig> , key enzymes for synthesizing ethylene stimulating fiber elongation  <cit> , and ein3-binding f box protein  <dig>  involved in ethylene signaling  <cit>  were up-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa. gast <dig> encoding for a ga promoting growth enzyme  <cit>  was highly up-regulated in md52ne. we also conducted go enrichment analysis using degs at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa separately .table  <dig> annotation of genes differentially expressed in md52ne at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa fiber



interestingly, multiple receptor-like kinases  localized in plasma membranes were differentially expressed in the developing fibers of md52ne as compared with md90ne. among the various classes of rlks described in fig.  <dig>  the leucine rich repeat  rlks containing three domains  were most frequently identified. the lrr rlks have been recently suggested as a novel signaling pathway regulating plant cell wall integrity maintenance  <cit>  and cellulose deposition in arabidopsis  <cit> . an lrr rlk  was one of the degs that were most highly up-regulated in developing md52ne fibers at both  <dig> dpa  and  <dig> dpa  .fig.  <dig> differential expressions of receptor-like kinases  in developing md52ne fibers at  <dig> dpa. differential expressions of rlks in different classes were generated by mapman. red and purple represent up- and down- regulations, respectively. the rlks contain three domains, including extracellular domain, transmembrane , and kinase domain in a cytoplasmic side. c-lectin, rlks with lectin-like motifs; crinkly4-like, rlks with crinkly4-like domains; duf <dig>  domain of unknown function 26; extensin, rlk with extensin motif; l-lectin, rlks with lectin-binding domains; lrk 10-like, rlk gene on lr <dig> locus; lrr, leucine-rich repeats; lysm, rlks with lysine motif; perk-like, proline-rich extensin-like kinase; rkf3-like, receptor-like kinase in flowers 3; s-locus, rlk with s-domain; thaumatin, rlk-like thaumatin protein; wak, wall-associated kinase

validation of degs in md52ne fibers
the expression patterns of the degs identified from rna-seq data of the two nils were validated with real time quantitative pcr  analysis. based on go enrichment analysis,  <dig> degs showing different expression pattern in the rna-seq were selected for rt-qpcr using rnas from developing fibers at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpa. comparative transcript levels of the all  <dig> degs obtained by both rt-qpcr and rna-seq were presented in additional file  <dig>  and the rt-qpcr results from the  <dig> critical degs were shown in fig.  <dig>  the identical expression patterns of all the tested degs between rt-qpcr and rna-seq indicated the reliability of both sequencing and the deg filtering process.fig.  <dig> rt-qpcr validation of selected genes related to cell wall activity during fiber development. three biological replications and three technical replications at four fiber development stages  were used for rt-qpcr analyses. aco <dig>  1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase  <dig>  or ethylene forming enzyme ; ebf <dig>  ein3-binding f box protein  <dig> ; lrr rlk, leucine rich repeat receptor-like kinase ; mby <dig> transcription factor ; cesa <dig>  cellulose synthase catalytic subunit a <dig> ; col <dig> constans like  <dig> ; chi/ctl, basic-chitinase/chitinase-like ; l18e/l <dig>  ribosomal l18e/l <dig> protein ; fad-linked oxidase

discussion
greater force is required for breaking individual fibers of md52ne than its nil, md90ne
the bfs value has been broadly used to evaluate fiber strength which is the breaking force of a fiber bundle. in addition to the breaking force, the bfs is also affected by variable fiber properties like length, fineness, maturity, and mic involved in fiber-to-fiber interactions. the correlation analysis of fiber properties from the 384 f <dig> progenies from a cross between md52ne and md90ne showed that the bfs variation of the nils was mainly determined by the breaking force with low effects from variable fiber properties related to fiber-to fiber interactions . the fiber length showing 5–6 % differences between the nils contributed a slight influence  on the bfs variances between the nils, whereas the fiber thickness related properties having insignificant variations between the nils had almost no effect on the bfs variances of the nils . since the bfs variance of the nils is mainly driven by breaking force, the ratio of the bundle strength between the nils was expected to be similar to the ratio of the individual fiber strength that is not affected by fiber-to fiber interactions. as predicted, the strengths of bundle  and individual fibers  from the md <dig> were similarly higher than those from the md90ne . as results, we concluded that the superior breaking force mainly contributed to the high bundle strength of the md52ne fibers with a minor contribution from longer fiber. compared with the cotton csil lines which have been used for studying fiber strength despite great potential effects from fiber length and thickness related properties due to their substantial variances among the csils  <cit> , the md52ne and md90ne are more ideal cotton nils for dissecting molecular mechanisms of intrinsic fiber strength since their bfs variance was mainly affected by the breaking force but minimally regulated by other fiber properties involved in fiber-to fiber interactions within a fiber bundle.

based on the fiber property analyses of the developing fibers whose crystallinity increased rapidly from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa , we determined that the transition from pcw to scw biosynthesis stages began at approximately  <dig> dpa. thus, we compared the transcript abundance in developing md52ne and md90ne fibers at two different time points:  <dig> dpa in which actively elongating fibers mainly consisted of pcw with low crystallinity , and  <dig> dpa in which scw thickening fibers were composed of both pcw and scw with high crystallinity . in the developing fibers at the transition stage, a new cell wall layer named as winding layer is deposited  <cit> . based on the observation of high fiber strength in developing fibers  composed of a winding layer with minimum scw  <cit> , the winding layer has been speculated as a potential source of fiber strength  <cit> . to determine if and how the winding layer contributes to the strength of bundle and individual fibers, further comprehensive studies may be necessary since single fiber strength of developing fibers was previously measured by an instron tensile tester that was a prototype for measuring individual fiber strength  <cit>  and caused high variability and inconsistency  <cit> . in our studies, high bfs values of the nils were also detected at the transition stage  of the nils . the bfs of developing md52ne fibers  was significantly  higher than that of developing md90ne fibers .

ethylene and its networking phytohormonal pathways may be involved in superior fiber length development in md52ne
comparative transcriptome analyses showed that transcripts related to ethylene and its networking auxin and ga signaling pathways for promoting fiber elongation were highly abundant in md52ne . ethylene gas is known as a major phytohormone stimulating fiber elongation  <cit> . up-regulations of ethylene synthesizing genes like acc and aco as well as ethylene signaling gene like ebf are critical for active fiber elongation . consistent with the prior findings, acc <dig>  aco <dig>  ebf <dig>  and erf <dig> involved in ethylene biosynthesis and signaling pathway required for fiber elongation were highly expressed in elongating md52ne fibers whose length  was longer than its nil, md90ne . in addition, transcripts  involved in auxin and ga were required for differentiating and elongating fibers  <cit> . for promoting fiber elongation, multiple expansins involved in loosening the cell walls and lipid transfer proteins involved in fiber elongating  <cit>  were also up-regulated in the md52ne fibers . a large set of genes  involved in xyloglucan and pectin biosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism requiring cotton fiber elongation  <cit>  was also enriched in the elongating md52ne fibers . a xet  and a sus  were linked with the qtls associated with bfs and uhml .fig.  <dig> proposed model for the mechanism responsible for high fiber bundle strength and individual fiber breaking force in md52ne. abbreviated names included in this model are: lrr rlk, leucine rich repeat receptor-like kinase; pcw, primary cell wall; scw, secondary cell wall; cme, cellulose micrfibrils; aco, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase; ebf, ein3-binding f box protein; aux/iaa, aux/iaa transcription factor; myb, myb transcription factor: wrky, wrky transcription factor; nac, nac transcription factor; exp, expensin; ltp, lipid transfer protein; pme, pectin methylesterase; xet, xyloglucan endotransglucosylase; cobra, cobra like protein; chi/ctl, chitinase/chitinase-like protein; ros, reactive oxygen species



receptor-like kinase signaling pathway regulating cellulose deposition and maintaining cell wall integrity may be involved in superior fiber strength development in md52ne
in addition to phytohormone and transcriptional networks controlling plant growth and development, receptor-like kinases  have been found as novel regulators for both plant development and stress responses  <cit> . among the various rlk classes described in fig.  <dig>  rlks containing a leucine-rich repeat  were most frequently identified from developing md52ne fibers. three lrr rlks were also found in the two qtls associated with bfs and length . in arabidopsis elongating root tips and seeds, two lrr rlks named fei  <dig> and  <dig> have been reported to play a role in cellulose deposition in arabidopsis elongating root tips  <cit>  and seed coat  <cit> . acc  that is essential for ethylene signaling has been suggested to be a signaling molecule for fei  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , so both ethylene and lrr rlk signaling are most likely involved in cellulose deposition in elongating tissues . other lrr rlks whose ligands are unknown are reported as a regulator of the scw formation in arabidopsis  <cit>  and popular trees  <cit> . a cotton lrr rlk named ghrlk <dig> located in the plasma membrane was reported to be induced during active scw synthesis stage  <cit> . therefore, lrr rlk signaling pathways might be involved in mediating a coordination of cell elongation and scw biosynthesis during cotton fiber development as suggested in other plants  <cit> .

temporal regulation of the genes involved in crystalline cellulose assembly at secondary wall biosynthesis stage of md52ne fibers
three genes  encoding cobra-like protein were specifically up-regulated during the scw biosynthesis stage in md52ne fibers . cobra-like protein  <dig>  a member of the gpi-anchored cobra-like family, has been recently identified to play a role in crystalline cellulose deposition in arabidopsis seed coat  <cit> . when a cobra-like protein was deficient in brittle culm <dig> rice mutant  <cit>  or brittle stalk <dig> maize mutant  <cit> , mechanical strength of the stems was reduced. a cobra-like protein interacting with cellulose modulates cellulose assembly in rice  <cit> . therefore, the three cobra-like proteins up-regulated at the scw stage of md52ne fibers can be candidate genes that contribute to the superior strength of md52ne .

four chi/ctl genes  specifically up-regulated in the scw stage of md52ne fibers were similar to the sequences of chitinase  and chitinase like protein  in other plants. ctl <dig> is responsible for crystalline cellulose content in arabidopsis  <cit> , whereas chi is a pathogenesis-related gene responding to biotic stress in rice and maize  <cit> . thus, the real function of chi/ctl genes identified from md52ne remains to be determined.

temporal regulation of genes at transition stage of md52ne fibers
we previously reported temporal up-regulation of scw biosynthesis-related genes at the transition from the pcw to scw stage in the md52ne fibers based on the transcriptome profiles performed with the first generation of cotton oligonucleotide microarray  <cit> . the present transcriptome analyses performed with rna-seq and g. hirsutum genome sequence identified many more degs in the md52ne fibers  than the previous microarray analysis  <cit> . the rna-seq analysis also showed that some scw biosynthesis-related genes such as myb <dig>  myb <dig>  and cesa <dig>  <cit>  were up-regulated specifically at  <dig> dpa . in contrast, other  <dig> cesas identified by the rna-seq did not show temporal up-regulation at the transition stage. for further analysis of the temporal regulation of scw biosynthesis-related genes, we retrieved  <dig> arabidopsis genes from planet  <cit>  that are temporally and spatially co-expressed during scw biosynthesis in arabidopsis. among the md52ne genes ortholgous to the  <dig> arabidopsis scw-related genes,  <dig> genes  showed temporal up-regulation in  <dig> dpa developing md <dig> fibers , whereas others showed no temporal up-regulation. in addition to the limited numbers of up-regulated scw genes in the md52ne over md90ne, the identical levels of the crystalinity between the nils  might imply that the genes related to scw cellulose biosynthesis were less involved in the superior fiber strength of the md52ne than the genes related to scw cellulose assembly and wall integrity.

CONCLUSIONS
the demand of high fiber strength has been increased dramatically with the advent of modern high speed spinning technology for producing yarn. cotton researchers have tried to improve this trait in g. hirsutum genetic backgrounds. md52ne was proven to have higher fiber strength than its nil md90ne. this study was conducted to unveil the molecular mechanisms behind the formation of superior individual fiber strength, which is correlated with yarn strength, in md52ne using rna-seq technology. the bundle strength of the md52ne fibers predominantly depends on individual fiber strength combined with fiber length. comparative transcriptome analyses of the nils suggested that the superior strength of md52ne fibers was potentially related to two signaling pathways : one is ethylene and its interconnected phytohormonal pathways involved in fiber elongation and interfiber interactions, and the other is rlks signaling pathways involved in regulating cell wall integrity and potentially mediating a coordination of cell elongation and scw biosynthesis. several secondary cell wall biogenesis related genes and transcription factors such as cobra-like protein, chi/ctl, nac, wrky, col <dig>  zinc finger family protein and myb were up-regulated in md52ne developing fibers. the superior bfs of md52ne fibers might be the result of high individual fiber strength with a minor contribution from longer fiber length. the longer fibers may increase the fiber-to-fiber interactions and are likely the result of differential regulation of some pcw related genes. the improved individual fiber strength of md52ne is likely related to pathways regulating cell wall integrity.
