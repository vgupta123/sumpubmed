BACKGROUND
recurrent alterations in dna copy number are a common feature in many cancers and typically target biological pathways and processes that contribute to cancer pathogenesis. the diagnostic and prognostic relevance of these chromosomal imbalances  has been demonstrated in an increasing number of tumor entities  <cit> . for the detection of unbalanced chromosomal aberrations different profiling platforms are commercially available. array cgh is a commonly applied high-resolution genome-wide screening method for research and diagnostic purposes  <cit>  but currently remains relatively expensive and labor-intensive. alternatively, pcr-based methods for the simultaneous detection of copy number changes in selected chromosomal regions such as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification   <cit>  are well established and suited to be applied on a routine basis  <cit> .

in this study, we evaluated the performance of a new method for relative quantification of specific dna sequences in routine laboratory practice, called multiplex amplicon quantification   <cit> . for this purpose, a maq assay was specifically designed for neuroblastoma , the most common solid extra-cranial pediatric malignancy  <cit> . this is a good model for maq validation as intensive research of genomic imbalances has revealed insights into the clinical and biological heterogeneity of this tumor  <cit> . more specifically, prognostic relevant, critical regions of loss and gain in nb have been delineated, the most important being 1p deletion, mycn amplification, 3p deletion, 11q deletion and 17q gain  <cit> . of further importance, new therapeutic protocols based on the presence or absence of these segmental abnormalities are in progress  <cit> . the maq-nb assay allows the detection of cnas in the prognostic relevant regions in nb. in this study, maq results were compared to copy number changes detected with mlpa on a series of  <dig> nb for which detailed array cgh profiles were available.

methods
neuroblastoma tumor samples and cell lines
a representative series of nb tumor samples was collected prior to therapy  . of these  <dig> nb samples,  <dig> samples present with only numerical and  <dig> with segmental aberrations . mycn amplification occurs in  <dig> cases. additionally,  <dig> nb cell lines with segmental aberrations of which  <dig> with mycn amplification were included in this study . dna was isolated from nb tumors, cell lines and control samples using the qiagen dna isolation kit  according to the manufacturer's instructions.

multiplex ligation probe amplification 
for mlpa analysis, the salsa nb kits p <dig>  and p <dig>   were used to investigate dna aberrations in specific chromosome regions of interest for nb  <cit> . the third nb kit p <dig>  targeting chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  was not used for this study. in the case of mycn amplified nb samples, a mycn silencing solution was added. target regions are indicated in figure  <dig>   <dig> ng of tumor dna was used for each mlpa reaction. in each experiment three control samples were analysed, allowing accurate normalisation, including an ebv cell line, constitutional blood from a healthy individual and human genomic dna . mlpa was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with minor adaptations in the pcr step. briefly, pcr was performed using  <dig> μl of the ligase-product and  <dig> μl of pcr-mix containing  <dig> μl of salsa primers,  <dig> μl salsa enzyme dilution buffer,  <dig> μl salsa pcr buffer and  <dig>  μl polymerase, diluted in hplc water, prepared on ice.

multiplex amplicon quantification 
for maq analysis, three kits were designed, maq <dig>  maq <dig> and maq <dig> as described in the results section.  <dig> ng of tumor dna was needed for each reaction of the maq analysis. for accurate normalisation, two control samples were included in each experiment, i.e. constitutional dna from a healthy individual and human genomic dna . after addition of  <dig> μl of pcr mix and  <dig>  μl of taq polymerase, samples were heated in a thermocycler with a heated lid  for  <dig> minutes at 98°c for activation of the polymerase. further pcr conditions required  <dig> cycles, including denaturation at 95°c for  <dig> seconds, annealing at 60°c for  <dig> seconds and extension for  <dig> minutes at 68°c. this was followed by a final extension step at 72°c for  <dig> minutes.

capillary electrophoresis and data analysis
for both mlpa and maq, resulting pcr products were analysed by capillary electrophoresis. a mixture of  <dig>  μl formamide  and  <dig>  μl internal lane standard  was prepared and  <dig> μl of the pcr-product was added. after a  <dig> minute denaturation-step at 95°c, the samples were analyzed on the abi3130xl  capillary electrophoresis system. the raw data generated by fragment analysis were analysed in a specially designed software program coffalyser  <cit>  and maq-s  <cit>  for mlpa and maq, respectively. both programs were designed to calculate and visualise the normalised peak area or dosage quotient which reflects copy number of each target amplicon. dosage quotients  are calculated using the reference amplicons  and the control samples . for one reference amplicon  and one control sample , the dq of a target amplicon  in sample  is as follows: dq = /. based on the data of all reference amplicons and control samples, a final dq is calculated as the mean of the individual dqs and the standard deviation of the dqs  is a measure of stability.

scoring rules for mlpa and maq
optimal scoring thresholds were applied for mlpa and maq. for mlpa scoring  we applied the following criteria. regions were scored as segmental deletions or gains if the dosage quotients of at least  <dig> consecutive loci is  <dig>  below or above  <dig>  respectively  <cit> or when more than 75% of the probes show a decrease or increase of at least  <dig> , respectively. when no segmental aberrations were detected in the tumor, the presence of numerical changes was evaluated. regions are scored as whole chromosomal losses or gains if at least 75% of the dosage quotients of both p and q arm have a value below or above  <dig>  respectively and more than half of the dosage quotients show an decrease or a increase of at least  <dig> . mycn amplification is scored if the  <dig> dosage quotients for the mycn locus increase with at least  <dig>  for maq scoring  we applied the following criteria. regions were scored as segmental deletions or gains if the dosage quotients of at least  <dig> consecutive loci is  <dig>  below or above  <dig>  respectively . when no segmental aberrations were detected in the tumor, the presence of numerical changes was evaluated. regions are scored as whole chromosomal losses or gains if at least 75% of the dosage quotients of both p and q arm have a value below or above  <dig>  respectively and more than half of the dosage quotients show an decrease or an increase of at least  <dig> . for scoring of mycn amplification the  <dig> dosage quotients for the mycn locus should increase with at least  <dig> 

array comparative genomic hybridisation 
samples were profiled on an in-house developed  <dig> mb resolution bac array as previously described  <cit>   or on a custom designed 44k array   enriched for critical regions in nb . utilizing random prime labeling ,  <dig> ng of tumor and control dna  was labeled with cy <dig> and cy <dig> dyes . further processing was then performed according to the manufacturer's instructions . slides were scanned using an agilent scanner , features were extracted using the feature extraction v <dig> . <dig>  software program and further processed with an in-house developed visualisation software program arraycghbase  <cit> . array cgh profiles were evaluated manually after application of the circular binary segmentation  algorithm, which is an algorithm to dissect genomic array data into regions of equal copy number by applying a maximal t-statistic with a permutation reference distribution to determine the change-points  <cit> . gains are indicated in green ; losses are indicated in red .

RESULTS
construction of the maq neuroblastoma assay
the maq technique consists of the quantification of fluorescently labelled test and control amplicons, obtained by a single multiplex pcr  amplification. as a first step in the construction of the maq neuroblastoma assay, primers were designed in the critical regions of loss  and gain  for nb and their respective opposite chromosome arm  <cit> . specialised software  <cit>  was used for the development of pcr primer sets within the chromosome regions of interest with a very high multiplexing degree, targeting up to  <dig> sequences each with a unique length. in this way, the nb-maq assay was created consisting of three kits. maq <dig> contains a total of  <dig> primer pairs with target regions on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> and maq <dig> contains  <dig> primer pairs targeting chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  for the detection of mycn  status, a separate kit  was designed, containing  <dig> primer pairs for chromosome  <dig>  this was necessary since the high levels of  amplification interfered with reliable analysis of other amplicons generated in the multiplex pcr. additionally, each kit includes  <dig> or  <dig> primer sets, covering chromosomal regions that show the lowest frequency of copy number changes in nb  and serve as reference sequences used for accurate normalisation. these regions were carefully selected through screening of the chromosomal status on array cgh profiles of  <dig> nb cases . the maq target regions are indicated in figure  <dig>  more detailed information on the target regions of the maq kits can be found in additional file  <dig> 

evaluation of the maq assay by comparison with mlpa and array cgh
the performance of the maq assay for the detection of cnas in prognostic relevant regions was evaluated by comparing results of  <dig> nb tumor samples and  <dig> nb cell lines with corresponding mlpa and array cgh profiles . for this analysis, each sample was screened once and scoring was applied as described in the methods section. based on array cgh results ,  <dig> groups were defined. one group consists of  <dig> tumor samples which presented exclusively with numerical aberrations , whereas the second group of  <dig> samples was characterised by the presence of segmental aberrations, sometimes in a numerical background . two nb tumor profiles representative for each subgroup are shown in figure  <dig>  illustrating high concordance between array cgh, mlpa and maq results.

performance of mlpa and maq for the detection of aberrations in each of the prognostic relevant regions is summarised in table  <dig>  the area under the curve  of the receiver operating curve  was used as a measure for accuracy, summarizing the sensitivity and specificity for a given test. high-quality tests with almost perfect performance will have an auc approaching 100%. roc curves are shown in additional file  <dig>  array cgh was used as golden standard for these analyses. for the subset of tumors with segmental aberrations, performance for detecting 1p, mycn, 3p, 11q and 17q status was very high for both techniques with average auc of  <dig> % and  <dig> % for mlpa and maq, respectively. the false positive rate for mlpa and maq was  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. for mlpa, no false negatives were detected while for maq one false negative was detected at chromosome 1p . it should be noted that the reference amplicons in this individual were all located in regions with a low level loss, therefore the lost 1p region appeared as normal.

performance in tumors with segmental  and numerical  aberrations for the recurrent nb copy number changes at chromosome  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  this evaluation includes area under curve , positive predictive value  and negative predictive value .

for the  <dig> cases presenting with only numerical aberrations, performance was evaluated for whole chromosome changes. overall, performance rates were less optimal for these tumors with average auc of  <dig> % and  <dig> % for mlpa and maq, respectively. when looking more into detail, the auc remains high for chromosome  <dig> for both techniques , demonstrating that high level gains are easily detected. while lower performance is seen for chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  as well for array cgh as for mlpa and maq, detection of whole chromosome gains and losses in near-triploid tumors is challenging. nevertheless, these aberrations can be detected rather unambiguously with array cgh due to the high amount of oligos used on these platforms . this problem is inherent to characteristics in nb tumors with numerical aneuploidy where many chromosomes are implicated, including those used as reference for normalisation. no false positives were detected with maq and the false positive rate for mlpa was  <dig> %, while the false negative rate was  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. importantly, for these near-triploid tumors the only clinically relevant question is whether any segmental aberrations are detected and this is not the case when maq is used.

furthermore, repeatability of maq measurements was tested by performing bland-altman analysis  <cit> . from this method the coefficient of repeatability was derived by calculating the average difference ±  <dig>  standard deviation of the difference. maq <dig> measurements of  <dig> samples  were found reliably repeatable. the coefficient of repeatability was  <dig>  for the tumors with segmental and  <dig>  for the tumors with numerical imbalances and therefore fall within the threshold boundaries used in the scoring procedure.

discussion
maq is a new pcr-based method that allows to determine the copy number status of multiple loci in a single assay. similar to mlpa, this technique fills the gap between more expensive genome-wide screening assays and cheaper methods that only provide information on a single locus. we validated maq in a model for nb as an alternative for mlpa, using array cgh data as a reference point. this study shows that maq is a robust and repeatable method for detection of prognostic relevant cnas in recurrently affected regions in nb tumors and cell lines. for all investigated samples, mycn amplification status, which is one of the strongest prognostic parameters, was accurately determined. in addition, maq reliably differentiates between tumors with segmental aberrations  and tumors with numerical aberrations   <cit> . for the detection of segmental gains and losses of one or more copies in  <dig> nb samples, performance was very high even when measured in a numerical background . of notice, the few discrepancies measured  could represent very small aberrations, which we anticipate to be very rare. the validity of such putative small aberrations might be examined by mlpa or maq assays enriched for probes in this region, ultra-high resolution arrays with dense coverage in this region or even next generation sequencing but this lies beyond the scope of our study. detection of whole chromosome imbalances in near-triploid tumors is more challenging for both array cgh and mlpa and maq. in general the presence of multiple gains and losses in these tumors hampers normalisation  <cit> . in our study,  <dig> out of  <dig> tumors with numerical aberrations , one or more reference chromosomes show cnas, thus further complicating accurate normalisation for maq. in the case of nb, the pattern of these tumors is clearly recognisable  <cit> . in addition, for prognostic purposes, it is not of importance to know which chromosomes are numerically aberrant but whether a distinction can be made between tumors with segmental and numerical aberrations. importantly, not a single false positive segmental aberration was detected by maq in near-triploid tumors with only numerical aberrations. in addition, whole chromosome  <dig> gain detection which is one of the typical characteristics of these tumors, was almost perfectly detected, thus allowing assignment of these tumors to the prognostic favorable category.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that the newly developed maq method can be used as a valuable diagnostic tool for reliable detection of copy number changes with prognostic relevance in nb. overall, pcr-based techniques harbor advantages in comparison to array cgh such as reduced expenses and sample-handling while maintaining high performance. moreover the equipment needed, i.e. a thermal cycler and a capillary electrophoresis system, is present in the majority of molecular biology laboratories performing routine diagnostics. as maq allows to measure copy number status of as much as  <dig> targets in one reaction, this is sufficient for many routine tests for which only a well defined and specific number of imbalances needs to be analysed. when comparing mlpa to maq, the latter method may have certain advantages . it requires less dna, reduced handling, experiment time and costs, while it occurs in a single closed-tube reaction, maximally limiting contamination problems. moreover, this test appears slightly more robust in our hands. at present, guidelines for the diagnostic work-up of nb recommend two independent molecular methods for the assessment of genetic alterations in nb  <cit> . in this context maq can be very well suited as complementary method to array cgh or fish.

*for the price calculation we envisioned an experiment in which only  <dig> nb sample is screened which is reasonable as nb is a very infrequent tumor 

**the mlpa protocol recommends to use at least  <dig> control samples while  <dig> control samples are sufficient for maq according to the manufacturers
