BACKGROUND
plants are subjected to constant attack by a variety of microbial pathogens and herbivores and they have evolved a complex battery of defense mechanisms that are activated by multiple defense signaling pathways. thus, in response to infection by some microbial pathogens, the interacting eds <dig> and pad <dig> proteins are induced and activated; these proteins positively regulate biosynthesis of salicylic acid  and sa-dependent defense signaling pathways  <cit> . other defense pathways mediated by ethylene  and jasmonic acid  also can be activated by certain pathogens and herbivores  <cit> . genetic and molecular analyses indicate that these distinct defense pathways cross-talk extensively and their relationship can be synergistic or antagonistic  <cit> .

activation of plant defense responses following pathogen infection is associated with induction of a large number of host genes  <cit> . some of the pathogen-induced genes encode proteins with direct anti-microbial activities  or enzymes involved in biosynthesis of anti-microbial compounds , whereas others encode proteins with regulatory functions in the defense signaling pathways. many of these defense genes appear to be induced at the transcriptional level through the specific recognition of cis-acting promoter elements and trans-acting sequence-specific dna-binding transcription factors. several classes of transcription factors have been implicated in plant defense responses, including dna-binding proteins containing the novel wrky zinc-finger motif  <cit> . although originally thought to be plant specific, genes encoding wrky proteins have been found in two non-photosynthetic eukaryotes, the slime mold dictyostelium and the protist giardia lamblia. the latter two organisms evolutionally precede the divergence of plants from animals and fungi, indicating an ancient origin of wrky transcription factors  <cit> . however, wrky genes have greatly proliferated and form large superfamilies in angiosperms, with more than  <dig> members in arabidopsis  <cit> .

a growing body of evidence suggests that wrky proteins play important roles in regulating genes associated with plant defense responses. for example, pathogen infection or treatment with elicitors or sa rapidly induces wrky gene expression in several plant species  <cit> . in arabidopsis, expression of many wrky genes was differentially regulated after pathogen infection or sa treatment  <cit> . moreover, many defense-related genes, including several pathogenesis-related  genes and the regulatory npr <dig> gene, contain w-box elements in their promoters  <cit> . w-box sequences are specifically recognized by wrky proteins and are necessary for inducible expression of these genes  <cit> .

in addition to this indirect evidence, several studies have revealed direct links between specific wrky proteins and plant defense responses. virus-induced silencing of three wrky genes in tobacco compromised n gene-mediated resistance to tobacco mosaic virus  <cit> . additionally, the arabidopsis resistance gene rrs <dig>  which confers resistance to the bacterial pathogen ralstonia solanacearum, encodes a novel wrky protein, wrky <dig>  that combines typical tir-nbs-lrr r protein motifs with a wrky domain  <cit> . moreover, two arabidopsis wrky genes  were shown to be induced by a map kinase pathway that mediates resistance responses to both bacterial and fungal pathogens and expression of wrky <dig> in transiently transformed leaves led to reduced disease symptoms  <cit> . likewise, constitutive expression of arabidopsis wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> conferred constitutive or enhanced expression of defense-related genes, including sa-induced pr <dig>  and increased resistance to virulent pathogens  <cit> . interestingly while overexpression of arabidopsis wrky <dig> activated sa-regulated pr <dig> gene expression and enhanced resistance to p. syringae, its coexpression with genes encoding its interacting partner wrky <dig> or wrky <dig> had opposite effects on arabidopsis resistance to the bacterial pathogen  <cit> .

in a previously reported study using yeast two-hybrid screening, arabidopsis map kinase  <dig> , an activator of ja/et-mediated defense and a repressor of sa-dependent resistance  <cit> , was found to interact with a mpk <dig> substrate mks <dig> that, in turn, interacts with arabidopsis wrky <dig> and wrky <dig>  <cit> . in addition, wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> were phosphorylated by mpk <dig> in vitro and a wrky <dig> knockout mutant expressed elevated levels of pr <dig> under a short-day growth condition  <cit> . these results suggest that wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> may function as downstream components of the mpk4-mediated sa-repressing and ja/et-activating signaling pathways. indeed, we have recently shown that disruption of wrky <dig> results in enhanced susceptibility to necrotrophic fungal pathogens and impaired expression of ja/et-regulated defense genes  <cit> . no such phenotypes were observed in the wrky <dig> t-dna insertion mutants. these results indicate that wrky <dig> functions as a positive regulator of ja/et-mediated pathways and plays an important role in disease resistance to necrotrophic fungal pathogen.

sa-mediated signaling has been shown to play a critical role in arabidopsis responses to infection by pseudomonas syringae  <cit> . we therefore used this model system to investigate the role of wrky <dig> in the activation of defense responses. wrky <dig> specifically bound the w-box sequence and was localized in the nucleus. in addition, wrky <dig> is induced by a variety of environmental stress stimuli, including sa and et treatment. further linking wrky <dig> with defense signaling, transgenic arabidopsis constitutively overexpressing wrky <dig> displayed reduced pathogen-induced pr <dig> gene expression and enhanced susceptibility to virulent p. syringae pv. maculicola strain es <dig> . by contrast, two independent t-dna insertion mutants for wrky <dig> developed milder disease symptoms than wild type plants after psmes <dig> infection. these results suggest that wrky <dig> plays a negative role in sa-regulated pr <dig> gene expression and resistance to p. syringae.

RESULTS
structure, dna binding and subcellular localization
arabidopsis wrky <dig>  encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a molecular weight of  <dig>  kd and an isolelectric point of  <dig>  . based on the presence of two wrky domains, wrky <dig> is classified as a group i wrky protein. the n-terminus and the region between the wrky domains are rich in serine and/or threonine residues . thus, wrky <dig> may be regulated, at least in part, via protein phosphorylation by a protein kinase such as mpk <dig>  <cit> .

wrky transcription factors are thought to function by binding their cognate ttgacc/t w-box cis-elements in the promoter regions of target genes and activating or repressing their expression  <cit> . a number of isolated wrky proteins have been shown to bind w-box sequences  <cit> . to examine the dna-binding activity of wrky <dig>  we expressed the gene in e. coli, purified the recombinant protein, and assayed its binding to an oligonucleotide that contains two direct ttgacc repeats  using emsa. several wrky25/dna complexes with differing mobility were detected when purified recombinant wrky <dig> protein was incubated with the pchn <dig> probe . whether the different complexes represent probes in which one or both of the w boxes are bound by wrky <dig>  or whether they are caused by formation of monomeric and oligomeric wrky <dig> complexes is unclear. alternatively, some of these complexes might result from protein degradation or incompletely translation of the wrky <dig> gene. binding of wrky <dig> was not detected with a mutant probe  in which both ttgacc sequences were changed to ttgaac . thus, binding of wrky <dig> to the ttgacc w-box sequence is highly specific.

if wrky <dig> is a transcription factor, it is likely to be localized in the nucleus. the presence of putative nuclear localization signal predicted by the psort ii program is consistent with this possibility. to determine the subcellular location of wrky <dig>  we constructed a gfp protein fusion of wrky <dig>  the fusion construct, driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter, was directly bombarded into onion  epidermal cells. as shown in figure  <dig>  the transiently expressed wrky25-gfp fusion protein was localized exclusively to the nucleus. by contrast, gfp was found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm due to its small size .

expression of wrky25
a possible role for wrky <dig> during defense signaling was further investigated by analyzing its expression in arabidopsis after inoculation with psmes <dig>  as shown in figure 3a, wrky <dig> mrna levels increase in wild-type plants after infiltration with either the control mgcl <dig> solution  or the bacterial suspension. however, wrky <dig> expression was prolonged in pathogen-infected plants, as transcript levels remained elevated at  <dig> hours post infiltration , whereas they were nearly undetectable in mgcl2-treated plant at this time .

to determine whether wrky <dig> expression is influenced by the sa, et and/or ja signaling pathways, wrky <dig> expression was monitored in various signaling mutants. induced wrky <dig> expression was modestly reduced in the npr1- <dig> and sid <dig> mutants, which are defective in sa signaling and biosynthesis, respectively  <cit>  . by contrast, no significant difference was observed in wrky <dig> expression between the wild-type plants and the et-insensitive ein <dig> mutant plants following mock or pathogen inoculation. analysis of the ja-insensitive coi <dig> mutant revealed a delay in wrky <dig> expression following mock inoculation; however, it was significantly enhanced after pathogen infiltration, as compared with that observed in wild-type plants . these results suggest that wrky <dig> expression is sensitive to environmental cues and it appears to be positively regulated by the sa signaling pathway but negatively regulated by the ja pathway.

we also analyzed wrk <dig> induction in wild-type plants sprayed with water, sa, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid  or methyl ja. wrky <dig> expression was rapidly induced in water-treated plants , underscoring that the gene is very responsive to environmental stimuli. plants sprayed with sa or acc accumulated greater levels of wrky <dig> transcripts than water-sprayed plants, whereas ja-treated plants accumulated less . thus, both sa and et regulate wrky <dig> expression in a positive manner, whereas ja has a negative effect on wrky <dig> expression.

disrupting or altering wrky <dig> expression affects disease resistance and symptom severity
to analyze the role of wrky <dig> in disease resistance, we identified two t-dna insertion mutants for wrky <dig>  wrky25- <dig>  contains a t-dna insertion in the promoter region while wrky25- <dig>  contains a t-dna insertion in the last intron of the wrky <dig> gene . homozygous mutant plants were identified by pcr with wrky25-specific primers. we then compared the wild-type and wrky <dig> mutants for induced accumulation of wrky <dig> transcripts. since mgcl <dig> treatment and pathogen infection had almost the same potency in inducing wrky <dig> expression , we used only pathogen infection in these experiments. northern analysis using a full-length wrky <dig> cdna clone as the probe detected wrky <dig> transcripts in wild-type plants but not in wrky25- <dig> plants after pathogen infection. by contrast, a wrky <dig> transcript of reduced size was detected in pathogen-infected wrky25- <dig> plants . this transcript was not detected when the same blot was probed with a dna fragment corresponding to the region downstream of the t-dna insertion site in wrky25- <dig> . thus, the t-dna insertion in the wrky25- <dig> mutant results in generation of a truncated wrky <dig> transcript that is predicted to generate a truncated wrky <dig> protein lacking the c-terminal wrky domain, which is important for dna binding  <cit> .

analysis of both wrky <dig> mutants revealed no difference in growth or morphology from that of wild-type plants; flowering also occurred at the normal time. following inoculation with psmes <dig>  the mutant lines supported similar levels of bacterial growth as wild-type plants . however, the inoculated leaves of wrky25- <dig> and wrky25- <dig> plants consistently displayed less disease symptom than wild-type plants .

to examine the effect of wrky <dig> overexpression, we generated plants containing a full-length wrky <dig> cdna driven by the camv 35s promoter . northern blotting identified several transgenic plants that contained elevated levels of wrky <dig> transcript constitutively . two transgenic lines  that constitutively expressed wrky <dig> at elevated levels and contain a single t-dna locus in their genomes, based on the ratio of antibiotic resistance phenotypes, were chosen for further study.

analysis of t <dig> homozygous plants from both lines revealed no difference in growth or development from that of wild-type plants, although their leaf color appear to be slightly paler. following inoculation with psmes <dig>  the transgenic 35s:w <dig> overexpression lines displayed substantially greater bacterial growth  than wild-type plants . the inoculated leaves of wrky25-overexpressing plants also developed more severe disease symptoms than those of wild-type plants after infection .

pr <dig> gene expression and sa accumulation
to study the molecular basis for the altered responses to psmes <dig> infection, pr <dig> gene expression was monitored. consistent with the enhanced susceptibility phenotype, wrky <dig> overexpressing lines contained substantially lower levels of pr <dig> transcripts than wild-type plants . in contrast, pr <dig> transcript levels in the wrky <dig> mutants were comparable to those in wild-type plants .

to determine whether altered pr <dig> induction in the wrky25-overexpressing plants correlated with reduced sa accumulation, the levels of both free sa and sa-glucoside conjugates  were monitored. both wild-type plants and the t-dna insertion mutants displayed similar levels of free sa and sag following psmes <dig> infection . free sa levels in wrky25-overexpressing plants were comparable to those in wild-type plants at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi; however, the level of free sa at  <dig> hpi was somewhat lower than in wild-type plants. sag levels in uninoculated wrky25-overexpressing plants also were ~10-fold lower than those in wild-type plants, although they rose to nearly wild-type levels after infection .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
to determine whether wrky <dig> is a transcription factor that regulates disease resistance, we analyzed its role in arabidopsis responses to the bacterial pathogen p. syringae. consistent with this putative function, wrky <dig> is a nuclear-localized, dna-binding protein that specifically recognizes the ttgac w-box sequences . analysis of wrky <dig> expression revealed that it is highly responsive to a variety of biotic and abiotic stress conditions . in wild-type plants, pathogen infection induced prolonged wrky <dig> expression, whereas induction by mock inoculation was more transient. sa treatment also induced wrky <dig> expression over that observed in water-treated plants, whereas it was reduced in ja-treated plants. further arguing that the sa and ja signaling pathways play positively and negatively roles in regulating wrky <dig> induction, respectively, was the demonstration that pathogen-induced wrky <dig> expression was reduced in npr1- <dig> and sid <dig> mutants and enhanced in the coi <dig> mutant. although ja frequently works with et to signal defense responses, the role of et in wrky <dig> expression is unclear. acc treatment induced wrky <dig> expression, but pathogen-induced expression of this gene was unaffected in the ein <dig> mutant. taken together, these results indicate that multiple signaling pathways associated with stress responses influence wrky <dig> induction.

strong evidence that this stress-induced wrky gene functions as a negative regulator of defense against p. syringae comes from analysis of both transgenic overexpression lines and two t-dna insertion mutants. constitutive overexpression of wrky <dig> suppressed pathogen-induced pr <dig> expression and enhanced both bacterial growth and symptom development as compared with wild-type plants, whereas the wrky <dig> mutants displayed reduced disease symptoms. since the wrky25- <dig> and wrky25- <dig> mutants supported wild-type levels of bacterial growth, pr <dig> expression and sa accumulation, it is possible that wrky <dig> exerts its negative effect primarily by promoting disease symptom development. consistent with this possibility, several studies have suggested that bacterial growth and symptom development are not necessarily linked and can be differentially affected by host genes. for example, the et-insensitive ein <dig> mutant supports normal bacterial growth but develops reduced chlorosis after infection by p. syringae as compared to wild-type plants  <cit> . in addition, disruption of the arabidopsis botrytis-susceptible  <dig>  gene, which encodes a r2r <dig> myb transcription factor, causes enhanced disease symptoms after infection of p. syringae without affecting bacterial growth  <cit> .

alternatively, the observation that wrky25-overexpressing plants displayed increased bacterial growth and enhanced disease symptoms suggests that this protein promotes both processes. if so, one possible explanation for why bacterial growth was unaffected in the wrky <dig> mutants is that wrky <dig> function might vary depending on its expression level and/or biological context. thus, relatively low-level and possibly tissue-specific expression of wrky <dig>  as in the wild-type plants, might promote symptom development, whereas the high-level, non-specific expression, as in the overexpression lines, might promote both disease symptoms and bacterial growth. alternatively, functional redundancy between various members of the large wrky gene family might mask the effect of a mutation in a single wrky gene. wrky <dig> shares very similar protein structure with wrky <dig> and they also display similar pathogen-induced expression patterns  <cit> . to test possible functional redundancy between the two wrky proteins, we have generated double knockout mutants for the two genes but observed no further enhancement in the phenotypes of disease resistance to either necrotrophic fungal pathogens or p. syringae .

a growing body of evidence indicates that pathogen infection can activate multiple signaling pathways in the regulation of diverse defense mechanisms  <cit> . sa-mediated signaling pathway, for example, play important roles in defense against biotrophic pathogens and in activation of systemic acquired resistance against a diverse range of microbial pathogens  <cit> . defense pathways mediated by ja and/or et, on the other hand, are more effective against herbivores and necrotrophic pathogens  <cit> . while these distinct defense pathways can sometimes function cooperatively, they often are antagonistic. sa has been shown to play an important role in signaling resistance to p. syringae  <cit> . thus, one possible mechanism through which wrky <dig> negatively regulates defense responses after p. syringae infection is by repressing the sa signaling pathway. supporting this possibility, plants overexpressing wrky <dig> displayed reduced pathogen-induced expression of pr <dig>  a molecular marker for sa-mediated defense pathways. since these overexpressing plants accumulated nearly wild-type levels of free sa, wrky <dig> may work at a point downstream of sa to repress defense responses. previous studies have revealed that suppression of the sa signaling pathway enhances the activation of ja-induced responses. thus, we tested whether wrky <dig> overexpressing lines and/or wrky <dig> mutants displayed altered responses to two necrotrophic fungal pathogens, botrytis cinerea and alternaria brassicicola. neither the wrky <dig> overexpression lines nor the mutants lines displayed altered fungal growth or symptom development .

it was recently demonstrated that wrky <dig> is phosphorylated by mpk <dig> in vitro; wrky <dig> also interacts with mks <dig>  a substrate of mpk <dig>  <cit> . these results, together with our analysis, suggest that wrky <dig> functions in the mpk <dig> signaling pathway that represses sa-mediated defense responses. wrky <dig> appears to function largely as an activator of ja/et-mediated signaling  <cit> . these studies support that these two wrky transcription factors function in the mpk4-mediated sa-repressing and ja/et-activating signaling pathways. in addition, our analyses revealed that wrky <dig> expression is induced by abiotic stress, such as infiltration with mgcl <dig> or spraying with water. previous studies have demonstrated that wrky <dig> also is induced by oxidative stress, heat shock and wounding  <cit> . thus, this transcription factor may play a role in responses to abiotic as well as biotic stresses. however, transgenic plants constitutively expressing wrky <dig> were not more tolerant to oxidative stress, as measured by root growth on agar plates in the presence or absence of the superoxide-generating agent paraquat  <cit> . whether our wrky <dig> overexpression plants and/or the loss-of-function mutants exhibit altered responses to other abiotic stress conditions has not been determined. future studies in this direction may reveal not only additional roles for wrky <dig> in plant defense and stress responses, but also possible interactions between their respective signaling pathways.
