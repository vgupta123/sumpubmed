BACKGROUND
buffaloes are said to be slow and hard milkers because of their slow milk ejection reflexes and hard teat sphincter muscles  <cit> . as a general practice, exogenous oxytocin injections are frequently administered in dairy animals to initiate the milk let down or occasionally to cure the disturbed milk ejection  <cit> . however, long term oxytocin administration in dairy animals could lead to addiction and reduced spontaneous milk ejection after withdrawal of oxytocin  <cit> .

total antioxidant capacity  provides biologically more relevant information that describes the dynamic equilibrium between pro-oxidants and antioxidants in the plasma compartment of animals and human beings  <cit> . under physiological conditions, there are sufficient reserves of antioxidants in the body that has the capability to cope with the production of free radicals  <cit> , which are produced continuously during normal metabolism and may increase as a result of pathological conditions  <cit> . however, when the production of free radicals exceeds the body’s antioxidant production potential, oxidative stress develops  <cit> . in dairy animals, pre-partum and early post-partum periods are very critical as they prone the animals to considerable physiological challenges by imposing significant metabolic stressors that may contribute to the onset of diverse disorders including ketosis, milk fever, mineral deficiencies etc.  <cit> . in pakistan, oxytocin is widely used in dairy animals to increase the milk production due to the lack of awareness about the health hazards associated with irrational use of oxytocin. keeping in view, the present study was conducted to determine the effect of oxytocin injection on health/oxidative stress biomarkers of lactating buffaloes.

RESULTS
indicators of oxidative stress
total oxidant status  and total antioxidant capacity 
in oxytocin injected group, the serum tos  was significantly higher  during 1st  and 5th month  of lactation as compared to control group . tac  was significantly higher  in control buffaloes on 2nd , 3rd , 4th  and 6th months  of lactation as compared to oxytocin injected buffaloes; whereas, the highest value for tac was recorded on 3rd month  of lactation in control group . pearson correlation coefficients indicated that tos was positively correlated  with tac in the control buffaloes ; whereas, in treated buffaloes no such significance was detected.

total homocysteine 
a significantly higher  concentration of thcy  was recorded in buffaloes of oxytocin injected group on 1st , 2nd  and 4th months  of lactation when compared with those of control group; whereas, highest thcy concentration was detected on 4th month  of lactation . correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation of thcy with tos  and tac .

paraoxonase- <dig>  activity
buffaloes of control group showed significantly higher  serum pon <dig> activity  during 2nd , 4th  and 5th months  of lactation as compared to those of oxytocin injected group which showed significantly higher pon <dig> activity during 1st month  of lactation . pon <dig> activity of control group was positively correlated with tos , tac , ceruloplasmin oxidase activity  and negatively correlated with arylesterase activity . pon <dig> activity of the lactating buffaloes injected with oxytocin showed a negative correlation with ceruloplasmin oxidase activity .

arylesterase activity
the serum arylesterase activity  increased significantly  during 1st , 5th  and 6th months  of lactation and the highest level was observed during 6th month  in the control group . arylesterase activity of oxytocin injected group was positively correlated with tac  and ceruloplasmin oxidase activity .

ceruloplasmin oxidase activity
animals injected with oxytocin showed significantly higher  ceruloplasmin oxidase activity  during 1st  and 4th months  of lactation as compared to control group; whereas, on 3rd month of lactation the difference between the ceruloplasmin oxidase activity of both the groups was statistically similar  .

discussion
oxytocin has been reported for a wide range of adverse effects in lactating animals including sheep, goat, cattle and buffaloes  <cit> . in lactating animals, the start of lactation is an important event with respect to the production of free radical. it has been reported in the literature that in malnourished lactating animals, negative energy balance is developed and in such circumstances, oxytocin favors the production of free radicals through mobilization of stored lipids and gluconeogenesis  <cit> . further, excessive oxidation of non-esterified fatty acids  in the liver also increased the production of reactive oxygen species  which ultimately produced the oxidative stress  <cit> .

in the present study, statistically tos was higher and tac was lower in oxytocin injected buffaloes and these results are consistent to the findings of  <cit>  who conducted similar studies in lactating cows. this might be due to the depletion of fat soluble antioxidants by the milk  <cit> . further, this reduction might also be due to decreased level of pon <dig>  <cit>  that was another peculiar finding of this study. moreover, in some previous studies, reduction in tac just after calving had also been correlated with increased production of reactive oxygen metabolites  and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance. elevation in these reactive substances induced imbalance between tac and production of free radicals leading to lipid peroxidation  <cit> .

oxidative stress has an important role in the metabolism of homocysteine. in present study, significantly higher thcy level was detected in oxytocin injected buffaloes that might be correlated with higher level of free radicals in circulation  <cit> . similarly,  <cit>  also observed a significant increase in the serum homocysteine on day  <dig> of lactation in the lactating ewes. altered plasma homocysteine levels had also been correlated with certain dietary factors such as protein and vitamin deficiencies  <cit> , renal dysfunction and hypothyroidism  <cit> .

the results of enzymatic activities revealed significantly lower pon <dig> and arylesterase levels in oxytocin injected buffaloes as compared to control  <cit>  also found a lower pon <dig> activity in the pregnant, early lactating and late lactating dairy cows. it might be correlated with increased level of homocysteine that triggered the atherosclerosis process due to which expression of pon <dig> gene in the hepatic tissue was down regulated  <cit> . it could be speculated that proatherogenic effects of thcy might be involved in the reduction of serum pon <dig> activity and thus altered antioxidant function. the pon <dig> enzyme is responsible for both paraoxonase and arylesterase activities in bovine serum, because it hydrolyses organophosphates  and aromatic esters such as phenyl acetate  <cit> . moreover, the elevated oxidative stress in the form of free radicals in the present study could lower pon <dig> activity  <cit> ; whereas, increased lipid metabolism in the form of lipid peroxidation might also result in lower pon <dig> activity  <cit> . the lipids act as substrate for lipid peroxidation and an inverse relationship exists between lipid peroxidation and pon <dig> activity  <cit> . additionally, inflammatory conditions induced by oxytocin injection could also be responsible for elevated oxidative stress, which directly decreased the pon <dig> activity  <cit> .

ceruloplasmin oxidase activity was found significantly higher in oxytocin injected buffaloes as compared to control. ceruloplasmin has oxidase activity and is related with the host acute phase responses  <cit>  and antioxidant defense in cattle  <cit>  so, its level might be enhanced during inflammation, tissue insult, certain malignant tumors  <cit>  and oxidative stress to quench the free radicals, produced during oxidative stress. so, ceruloplasmin oxidase activity is the important health parameter that could be used to judge the health status and well-being of the animals  <cit> . previous studies reported that higher ceruloplasmin oxidase activity in freshly calved animals is linked with a physiological phenomenon  <cit> . in the present study, increased activity of ceruloplasmin might be due to pathological inflammatory condition, induced by oxytocin  <cit> . in inflammatory conditions, cytokines such as interleukin- <dig> and interleukin- <dig> are released from leukocytes which stimulate the liver to secrete ceruloplasmin  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, oxytocin injection in lactating animals resulted in higher oxidative stress by enhancing the total homocysteine level and ceruloplasmin oxidase activity and decreasing enzymatic activities of antioxidant enzymes including paraoxonase- <dig> and arylesterase. the results of present study discourage the irrational use of oxytocin for milk let down in lactating animals that may prone the animals to poor productive performance and reproductive efficiency.
