BACKGROUND
boar taint is an offensive urine or faecal-like odour, affecting the smell and taste of some cooked pork. androstenone and skatole, which are lipophilic compounds that accumulate in the fat of mature non-castrated male pigs, have been identified as the main causes of boar taint  <cit> . a range of thresholds, above which negative reactions from consumers are expected, have been reported for androstenone  and skatole  . the scale of the problem was revealed in a large eu study of carcasses from over  <dig>  non-castrated male pigs. androstenone levels exceeded  <dig>  μg/g fat and skatole levels exceeded  <dig>  μg/g fat in 30% and 11% of these carcasses, respectively  <cit> . the cost of testing, losses in carcass value and potential future lost sales result in a substantial economic cost to the industry.

androstenone or 5α-androst-16-en-one is a male steroid produced in the testes at sexual maturity. high concentrations of androstenone are present in the saliva of male pigs where it is converted to a pheromone and is an important olfactory trigger for sexual behaviour in sows  <cit> . androstenone accumulates in adipose tissue producing taint when the fat is heated. the ability to detect this taint is itself under genetic control in humans and largely governed by the or7d <dig> receptor. approximately 70% of the human population are unable to detect the associated urine like odour  <cit> . skatole or 3-methyl-indole is produced from the breakdown of tryptophan by bacteria in the hindgut of the pig and subsequently absorbed into the blood stream where it is largely metabolised in the liver and excreted in urine. skatole which is not degraded in the liver is deposited in peripheral tissues mainly accumulating in adipose tissue.

the most effective solution, to date, for controlling boar taint, is surgical castration shortly after birth. however, as castration removes natural anabolic androgens that promote lean growth, non-castrates are leaner with 10-30% greater efficiency in feed conversion and superior meat quality. furthermore, concerns over animal welfare have led to legislative control  <cit> . within europe an industry-wide agreement is in place to cease castration for welfare reasons by  <dig> , forcing the industry to explore other methods to prevent tainted carcasses.

selective breeding based on the identification and exploitation of genetic variation in androstenone and skatole levels could ultimately provide a more sustainable solution  <cit> . recent studies have revealed quantitative trait loci  with effects on skatole or androstenone, including qtl mapped to almost every chromosome . the genetic architecture of predisposition to boar taint shows evidence for inter- and intra-breed variation with many of the reported effects appearing to be breed specific . in general, duroc pigs tend to have high levels of androstenone, and the landrace breeds high levels of skatole. the relationship between the two compounds is complex. testicular steroids have been shown to inhibit the breakdown of skatole in the liver but the relationship between the compounds and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood  <cit> .

although highly successful at identifying new trait associated loci and pathways, human genome-wide association studies  have failed to capture a large proportion of the genetic variation in complex traits  <cit> . to address this so-called ‘missing heritability’ gap, methods have been developed involving the analysis of larger regions of the genome to account for variation unexplained by analysis of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms   <cit> . estimating local heritability using larger regions captures additive variation in the genome which might elude the stringent significance thresholds necessary for testing each snp individually. it has also been suggested that rare variants not in complete linkage disequilibrium  with common snp markers are captured by estimating the genetic variation from an entire “region” or set of snps  <cit> .

the objective of this study was to identify genomic regions with effects on boar taint in landrace pigs.

results are reported from the two approaches used:  single snp analysis using genome-wide association, and  a regional approach dividing snps by chromosome and estimating genetic variation attributable to each autosome.

RESULTS
we acquired data for a population of approximately  <dig>  commercial danish landrace boars. the animals were slaughtered at a mean age of  <dig>  days. measures for skatole were taken using an in-line procedure at three danish abattoirs. power to detect a qtl can be increased in a finite sample by selecting those individuals that differ most from the phenotypic mean i.e. the extremes of the phenotypic distribution. here, we took extreme animals plus a within-litter ‘control’ in order to maximize power while controlling for family stratification. this strategy maximises the potential genetic information to be gained from the sample  <cit> . thus,  <dig> boars with high skatole  at slaughter, each matched with a low skatole litter mate  were selected for genome-wide analysis. phenotypic measurements for androstenone in adipose tissue were subsequently collected for these selected  <dig>  boars.

the measures for both skatole and androstenone were positively skewed and were log transformed prior to analysis . descriptive statistics and heritabilities for both traits are given in table  <dig>  pedigree information and skatole measures were available for  <dig>  boars from the initial population that were not selected for genotyping and genome-wide analyses. narrow sense heritabilities estimated from pedigree relationships h2pedigree  using all  <dig>  records for skatole and  <dig>  records for androstenone were moderate at  <dig>   and  <dig>   respectively and were similar to those previously reported  <cit> . the genomic heritability estimate of  <dig>   for skatole in the selected individuals was very low . this result was expected and reflects the experimental design as the selected individuals comprised phenotypically divergent sibs for skatole thus maximising the within family variance. narrow sense heritability is based on a ratio of the between and within family variance and is therefore reduced ). comparing variance components estimated from the unselected and selected populations provides an indication of how effects estimated in the selected sample would scale to the population as a whole. mean skatole measures for selected boars and their litter mates were  <dig>   and  <dig>   μg/g respectively. although data were selected for skatole, androstenone measures also differed slightly  between the two groups with a mean of  <dig>   μg/g in the high skatole animals, and  <dig>   μg/g in their low skatole litter mates. the estimated genetic correlation between skatole and androstenone in the selected data was  <dig>  . because the estimate of the additive genetic variance in skatole is biased downwards in the genotyped subset, the genetic correlation between skatole and androstenone is also likely to be underestimated.table  <dig>

genome-wide association study 
dna isolated from muscle samples collected at slaughter were genotyped for  <dig>  snps using the illumina porcinesnp <dig> beadchip  <cit> . analysis was restricted to the autosomes. the genotype data were subjected to quality control  through an iterative process performed using the genabel package in r  <dig> . <dig> software  <cit> . the qc criteria for snps were call rates >  <dig>  and minor allele frequencies  >  <dig> . the qc criteria for individuals were call rates >  <dig> , heterozygosity >  <dig>  ) and identity-by-state  >  <dig> . after qc,  <dig>  autosomal snps and  <dig> individuals were included in the final analysis. snp locations throughout the analysis are given according to the published draft pig genome sequence   <cit>  and as available in ensembl release  <dig> .

population stratification
genome wide association is based on differences in allele frequencies associated with differences in the trait under study. phenomena such as admixture, selection and population stratification can result in spurious patterns of allele frequencies unrelated to the trait. population stratification can be assessed by clustering individuals based on measures of relatedness and examining clusters for evidence of systematic bias. here, model based clustering was performed using the mclust function in r software  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . mclust uses bayesian information criterion  and an expectation maximisation algorithm  to select the optimal model and number of clusters. the best fit for the data was  <dig> elipsoidal clusters . multi-dimensional scaling  was applied to a distance matrix obtained as a function of the weighted genomic relationship matrix. multi-dimensional scaling returns a matrix with k columns whose rows give the coordinates of the points chosen to represent dissimilarities. k is a user defined parameter based on the expected number of clusters, here k =  <dig>  the  <dig> columns from the mds matrix were fitted into the linear model as covariates in order to account for the population stratification indicated by the model based clustering.figure  <dig>

the differences in study design between the two traits  were reflected in the gwas by very different estimates of lambda, which is an indicator of bias due to population structure. lambda was close to  <dig> for all of the skatole analyses where high and low animals were matched sibs, but greater than  <dig> for the androstenone analyses. this result indicates that the sampling design for skatole was balanced and therefore, unaffected by potential biases arising from any population stratification. although lambda indicates some bias for the androstenone analyses, this bias was largely accounted for with the inclusion of the co-ordinates from the multi-dimensional scaling  matrix in the model . any remaining stratification was successfully corrected for by fitting the genomic relationship matrix. full details are given in the materials and methods.

skatole
the effect of the siri <dig> snp at the telomeric end of ssc <dig> on skatole levels was highly significant  exceeding the genome-wide threshold  and explaining ~5% of the phenotypic variance. this snp lies within the cyp2e <dig> gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in the breakdown of skatole . the next ranking snp after the snps in ld with siri <dig> is the asga <dig> snp on chromosome  <dig>  the asga <dig> snp lies within the gene tet <dig> or methylcytosine dioxygenase  <dig>  there is no obvious connection between the function of this gene or any other protein coding genes within  <dig> mbp of tet <dig> as currently annotated in the pig genome and skatole metabolism or storage. snps on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> also reach nominal significance. when we fitted siri <dig> as a fixed effect the ranking changed and marc <dig> was the top ranking snp .

androstenone
a peak of genome-wide significant snp effects on androstenone was seen on ssc <dig>  explaining 4% of the phenotypic variation . two snps h3ga <dig> and asga <dig> mapping  <dig> mbp apart are highly significant. figure  <dig> shows the ld structure and genes around the ssc <dig> peak snp for androstenone. ld between the two snps is relatively high at r2 =  <dig>  suggesting that both snps are tagging the same causal variant. there were also snps with large effects on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . ssc <dig> and  <dig> exceeded the genome-wide false discovery rate. alga <dig> on ssc <dig> does not map to any known gene. asga <dig> on ssc <dig> lies within ptprt or protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type t and asga <dig> on ssc <dig> lies within the fh <dig> domain containing  <dig> gene.figure  <dig>

autosomal heritability
the linear mixed model  can be extended to divide phenotypic variance into estimates of the genetic and environmental variance containing information from genotypes of a group of n snps spanning a region. this method has been implemented in the gcta software package and it has been shown that the method can be used to estimate genetic variation for any region of the genome  <cit> . we divided the pig genome into the  <dig> autosomes and jointly estimated the contribution to heritability of androstenone  from each autosome . the total heritability summed over all autosomes was  <dig>  for androstenone. as with the total heritability, the autosomal heritabilities for skatole will be specific to the genotyped subset and underestimated for the unselected population due to the study design. for this reason we have omitted the results on skatole from the main text, but these results can be found in additional file  <dig> figure  <dig>

individual lrt  for each chromosome for androstenone are detailed in table  <dig>  these were derived by the lrtpoly test comparing a linear mixed model fitting systematic or fixed effects and a grm based on information from all snps with a model incorporating an additional variance component for the genetic variance attributable to all snps on a chromosome. this provides a test of whether inclusion of individual autosomes provides a better model of the variance than the overall relationship matrix . estimates of the autosomal heritabilities for effects on androstenone for lrtpoly are summarised in table  <dig> table  <dig> 
estimates of autosomal heritability for androstenone


autosome
polygenic
testing strategy was to compare fitting a random polygenic effect  plus a random effect for variance attributed to snps from a single autosome with a reduced model fitting only the random polygenic effect. p-val is the corresponding p value based on the distribution of the lrt being between χ2
 <dig> and a point mass of zero. h <dig> autosome is an estimate of the heritability of the autosome, h <dig> polygenic is an estimate of the heritability from the entire genome.



for androstenone, the only autosome with a significant lrtpoly test for genetic variance was chromosome  <dig> explaining 6% of the phenotypic variation, reflecting the gwas results. under the lrtpoly method, autosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> each explain 2% of the phenotypic variation, however, the estimates are not significant. when all autosomes are fitted simultaneously  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig> and ssc <dig> explain 5%, 3% and 4% of the genetic variation. the sum of autosomal estimates of genetic variation from lrtpoly is  <dig>  . the genetic variation explained by fitting all autosomes simultaneously was  <dig>  , indicating that lrtpoly is conservative as might be expected as part of the individual autosomal heritabilities are absorbed by the overall genomic polygenic effect.

an alternative testing strategy is to fit all autosomes in a full model and then drop them one at a time for a reduced model . a comparison of significance of autosomal heritability of androstenone using three testing strategies is given in figure  <dig>  dropping a chromosome from the model including all the autosomes provides a test for whether genetic variance is associated with that particular chromosome whilst accounting for background polygenic effects on other chromosomes. this contrasts with the model containing only a single chromosome  where the lrt and variance explained may be inflated by genetic variance from the rest of the genome that is not explicitly included in the model. for androstenone the results for lrtdrop suggest that chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> explain a significant proportion of the variance.figure  <dig>

discussion
a genome-wide association study  was carried out to identify snps associated with effects on androstenone and skatole in intact male pigs. the effect of the siri <dig> snp on skatole estimated by fitting the genotypes as a covariate in the linear mixed model  was 5% of the phenotypic variance of the selected population . the expectation in the general population assuming a heritability of  <dig>  is that it would explain ~ <dig> % of the genetic variation. the siri <dig> snp, which was reported previously as aj697882_ <dig>  <cit> , is located within the promoter of the cyp2e <dig> gene. in a small separate sample of  <dig> danish pigs significantly more aj697882_ <dig>  cc homozygotes were observed in the ‘high’ skatole group  <cit> . more recently associations between skatole levels in two duroc populations and the aj697882_ <dig>  snp have been reported  <cit> . again the cc homozygotes exhibited the highest skatole levels. although siri <dig> lies within a block of high ld  spanning several other genes there is evidence to support cyp2e <dig> as a candidate for the gene responsible for the observed associations with skatole levels. this gene has been previously identified as a candidate and is involved in the degradation of skatole in the liver where it is solely and abundantly expressed  <cit>  .figure  <dig>

the gwas for skatole was repeated, fitting the snp siri <dig> into the linear mixed model as a fixed effect. this model resulted in a change of ranking among the snps. the effect of greatest significance  was associated with snp marker marc <dig> located on chromosome  <dig> within the estradiol 17-beta-dehydrogenase  <dig>  gene. the hsd17b <dig> gene and marc <dig> snp were located at ssc6: <dig> ,200- <dig> , <dig> in an earlier genome assembly  but are located on unplaced scaffolds on the present assembly . the assignment of marc <dig> snp to ssc <dig> is confirmed from radiation hybrid mapping data . both the marc <dig> snp and hsd17b <dig> gene are present in the sequence of the ch242-77h <dig> bac clone . incomplete sequence data from this bac clone contribute to the current pig genome assembly  on ssc <dig>  <dig> - <dig>  mbp. this snp did not exceed the fdr or genome-wide threshold, however a region on chromosome  <dig> spanning this gene was previously found to be significant for skatole in landrace pigs  <cit> . ramos et al.,  <cit>  found significant associations between skatole levels in duroc pigs and snps mapping to a  <dig> mbp region on ssc <dig> corresponding to  <dig> - <dig>  mbp in sscrofa <dig>  coordinates and thus including the marc <dig> snp and hsd17b <dig> gene. in an earlier study, we mapped qtl for skatole, as detected by a  sensory panel, by linkage analysis with a low density microsatellite marker map with the closest marker sw <dig> mapping to ssc6:  <dig>  mbp   <cit> . human estradiol 17-beta-dehydrogenase  <dig>  is involved in the synthesis of the  <dig> beta-hydroxysteroids: delta 5-androstene- <dig> beta,  <dig> beta-diol, testosterone,  <dig> beta-estradiol and dihydrotestosterone  <cit> . the hsd17b <dig> gene is thus important for steroid hormone synthesis and is abundantly expressed in pig liver, ureter and stomach ,  <cit>  . another 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehyrdorgenase gene  has been examined as a candidate gene for an androstenone qtl on ssc <dig>  <cit> .

a significant effect on androstenone was found associated with the h3ga <dig> snp on chromosome  <dig> explaining ~4% of the phenotypic variance. h3ga <dig> lies between the gene encoding transcription factor neurod <dig> neurogenic differentiation  <dig> and the tespa <dig> thymocyte expressed positive selection association  <dig> locus. in humans tespa <dig> is involved in the selection of thymocytes and t-cell development. it has been hypothesised that the production of glucocorticoid steroids may in some way regulate thymocyte selection  <cit> . the second most significant gwas result was for asga <dig> which is located ~ <dig> mbp distal to the h3ga <dig> snp on chromosome  <dig>  the genes of interest located within this  <dig> mbp region include the retinol dehydrogenase  <dig>  and retinol dehydrogenase  <dig>  genes. the rdh gene encodes an enzyme which recognizes 5α-androstan-3α,17β-diol and androsterone as substrates and is expressed in liver, testes and other tissues in humans  <cit> . rdh <dig> is abundantly expressed in pig liver, testes and placenta  <cit>  . another 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehyrdrogenase gene  is located about  <dig>  mbp upstream of the asga <dig> snp. the  <dig> mbp region between the two top snps is gene-rich and exhibits high levels of ld in the danish landrace population studied . ironically, many of the genes in this region encode olfactory receptors. the minor allele frequency for both snps  was  <dig>  and the r <dig> between them was  <dig> . fitting either snp results in the loss of the effect indicating that both snps are tagging the same causal variant. this region has been found to be significant for androstenone measured in the fat of duroc pigs, and for estradiol in landrace pigs  <cit> , however this region has not previously been found to be significant for effects on androstenone levels in landrace.

results from the regional heritability study reflected the gwas analysis with the greatest heritability for androstenone on chromosome  <dig>  this indicates that the regional approach successfully identifies autosomes with genetic variation attributable to the trait and that genetic variance is not correlated to the length of autosomes as seen by yang et al.  <cit> . here, the correlation of variance explained, with length of autosome, was  <dig>   for androstenone. there was evidence of information beyond the gwas results from the regional approach. the method did point to an association of ssc <dig> and ssc <dig> with androstenone not seen in the gwas. highly significant effects for multiple qtl on these chromosomes associated with androstenone have been previously reported . we cannot ascertain whether the snp effect on ssc <dig> associated with androstenone is undetected by the regional approach or a spurious artifact of the gwas. one approach might be using sequence information for imputation to increase the number of snp genotypes and subsequently to divide the genome into many smaller regions providing greater resolution. combined results of multiple snp genotypes are less likely to yield spurious results from anomalies such as population stratification and differing minor allele frequencies at individual snps. the autosomes explaining the most variation have a greater likelihood for housing putative candidate genes and pathways. a further use for the estimated snp or region effects in this population could be genomic prediction in unphenotyped individuals. this potential application is of particular relevance in traits that can only be measured post slaughter such as boar taint where phenotypes are of high economic impact and could result in rejection of the entire carcass.

CONCLUSIONS
significant associations were found for skatole on ssc <dig> and for androstenone on ssc <dig> in landrace pigs. the study agrees with a body of evidence that the cyp2e <dig> gene has effects on skatole breakdown in the liver. autosomal heritability estimates agree with the gwas and provide an opportunity to identify regions for further study. differences between the gwas and the autosomal heritability suggest that for androstenone there is variation explained by ssc <dig> and ssc <dig> that is not detected by the gwas and that the snp on chromosome  <dig> does not appear to contribute variance at the level of the autosome.
