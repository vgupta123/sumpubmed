BACKGROUND
one of the most important findings of comparing related genomes was the widespread copy number variations  in eukaryotic genomes. cnvs, also called unbalanced structural variations, include deletions, insertions, and duplications of ≥ 50 bp in size, which can change gene structure and dosage, and modify gene regulation  <cit> . however, among all the forms of genetic variations present in a genome, cnv is one of the most difficult to genotype and elucidate their evolutionary consequences  <cit> . since a larger fraction of the genome were affected by cnvs other than single nucleotide polymorphisms, cnvs are responsible for more heritable differences between individuals, implying their important roles in phenotypic variations  <cit> . cnvs are likely to have significant functional impacts on genes and may explain some phenotypic variations not captured by snp-based studies  <cit> . many detailed studies have been performed to interpret the relationship between cnvs and phenotypic variations in mammalian genomes , drosophila , and domestic animals . in humans, many cnvs have been linked to various diseases and traits  <cit>  and most of them can lead to genetic and phenotypic difference between individuals and populations  <cit> . furthermore, ancient cnvs that differ between human and non-human primates have led to species-specific phenotypes .

in plants, there are growing evidences indicating that genes affected by cnvs are associated with important traits. for example, cnvs at the rhg <dig> locus can mediate resistance to soybean cyst nematode  <cit> ; cnv in a transporter gene  of maize was found to be the genetic basis for aluminum tolerance  <cit> . in barley, increased copy number of a boron transporter gene  conferred tolerance to boron-toxicity  <cit> . in rice , a deletion in qpe9- <dig> is associated with panicle erectness  <cit> , a deletion of the qsw <dig> gene caused the increase in grain size  <cit> , and a duplication of gl <dig> locus contributed to grain size diversity  <cit> . however, the exploration of the extent and role of cnvs in plants is still just beginning. several recent studies have provided a first glimpse of plant cnvs on a genomic scale. in maize, cnvs and presence/absence variations were pervasive in maize inbreed lines  <cit> , and most of them were enriched at loci associated with important traits  <cit> . combined with other genome analyses in soybean  <cit> , rice , arabidopsis , sorghum  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , and barley  <cit> , these results showed that genes affected by cnvs were significantly enriched in defense responses, and responses to stresses.

cnvs have emerged as a consequence of errors in dna recombination, replication, and repair-associated processes  <cit> . the detailed understanding of cnv mutation mechanisms in eukaryotes is mainly based on dna double-strand break  repair studies in bacteria, yeast, and other mammalian somatic cells . in general, there are two pathways for dsb repair:  non-homologous recombination , also named illegitimate recombination, which includes non-homologous end joining  and microhomology-mediated end joining , and can be independent of sequence homology, or only requiring microhomology patches of 1–10 bp;  homology-based repair including non-allelic homologous recombination , which requires extensive regions of sequence homology   <cit> . by examining the sequence context of cnv regions and breakpoints, other mutational processes have also been characterized, including mobile element insertion  and shrinking or expansion of variable number of tandem repeats   <cit>  mediated by misalignment of repetitive dna sequences  <cit> .

the genus oryza consists of  <dig> species including the asian cultivated rice  <cit> . because of its diversity of species, well-characterized phylogeny, and rich genomic resources, the genus oryza became an ideal model for studies of genome evolution  <cit> . recently, the availability of genome sequencing data for several oryza species provided an opportunity to explore structural variations and mechanisms underlying oryza genome evolution . several studies have demonstrated the prevalence of cnvs in the oryza species ; however, detailed analyses of the impact and origin of cnvs have not been performed. the identification of precise cnv sequences is a crucial prerequisite for detailed cnv characterization and functional analysis  <cit> . compared to comparative genomic hybridization -based survey, next-generation sequencing -based method have enabled cnv mapping at single-nucleotide resolution . in the present study, we generated a cnv map at single-nucleotide resolution using ngs-based approach for  <dig> rice accessions  <cit> . the high-resolution cnv map enabled us to elucidate the functional impacts and mutational mechanisms of cnvs in the oryza species.

RESULTS
cnv discovery
we applied three complementary approaches to identify cnvs in the oryza species:  paired-end  mapping based on analysis of abnormally mapping reads of size-selected clone ends  <cit> ;  split-read  analysis, which examines gapped alignments of dna reads  <cit> ;  read-depth  analysis, which detects cnvs by analyzing the read depth-of-coverage  <cit> . to obtain a full range of high-confidence cnvs detectable by these complementary sequence features , we integrated the results from three cnv discovery tools: breakdancer  <cit> , cnvnator  <cit> , and pindel  <cit> . this approach is depicted in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> copy number variations discovered using ngs-based survey. a the pipeline of cnv discovery and validation. b example of a cnv supported by abnormal pair-end reads  and reads-depth . light grey boxes represent pair-end reads. 25901_trj and 11010_trj are two rice accessions with or without the cnv, respectively



we focused initially on deletions compared to the reference genome nipponbare. in total, we detected  <dig>  deletions with sizes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp . most of these deletions  were inferred breakpoints at single nucleotide resolution, representing a genome-wide, base-pair resolution cnv catalog in the oryza species . the cnvs were defined as deletions relative to the reference genome. to determine whether these cnvs are deletions or insertions in an evolutionary context, we introduced oryza glaberrima as the outgroup  <cit> . by comparing to the orthologous regions in o. glaberrima, we re-defined the variation types of this cnv dataset: among  <dig>  deletion events,  <dig>   are actually insertions,  <dig>   are bona fide deletions, and  <dig>  were not defined due to sequence gaps in o. glaberrima .

extensive validation of cnvs
to assess the quality of this cnv dataset, we performed pcr validation for  <dig> candidate loci. we performed pcr experiments in five rice accessions, and  <dig>  %  of the cnv events were verified . we also compared the dataset with recently reported cnv data by read-depth based method only  <cit> . these two datasets were overlapping for 68 %  .

next, we assessed the data by comparison with a microarray-based study in japonica and indica subspecies  <cit>  and a bac-based report between rice and three of its closest relatives  <cit> . only  <dig> events were overlapped with the microarray data and three with the bac data . a possible explanation for this small overlap is that different size ranges were detected by different methods. while previously reported cnvs were focused on large-sized events, this data are mainly composed of intermediate-sized cnvs, with 87 %  smaller than  <dig> kbp.

impact of cnvs on genes and gene function
the single nucleotide resolution of the cnv map enabled us to evaluate the functional consequences of cnvs on genes and gene function. in total,  <dig>  genes were affected by  <dig>  cnvs, and the coding regions of  <dig>  genes were disrupted by cnvs, causing  <dig> partial gene deletions and  <dig>  full gene deletions . we next evaluated the population distribution for  <dig> cnv events which affect  <dig>  full genes. nearly  <dig>  % cnvs were shared by both cultivated and wild rice, whereas  <dig>  % was observed in wild rice, and  <dig>  % was present in cultivated rice. the identification of fewer wild-specific cnvs could be a consequence of the inclusion of fewer wild rice lines  in this study, and sequence reads from wild accessions that may could not be mapped to the reference genome. we further assessed the distribution of cnvs in subpopulations involving the o. sativa subspecies japonica  and indica . the proportion of cnvs detected only in indica was  <dig>  %, and  <dig>  % in japonica. the remaining  <dig>  % was shared by both of them . the majority of cnvs were shared by cultivated and wild rice or indica and japonica, suggesting that most of these cnvs were derived from the same gene pool. the gene ontology  analysis of  <dig>  cnv genes suggested that they were significantly enriched in functional categories involved in interactions with the environment, including apoptotic processes, responses to stresses, hypersensitive responses and others . however, when we focused on  <dig>  full genes affected by cnv, their function are enriched in apoptotic process .table  <dig> overview of the cnv dataset in  <dig> rice accessions




we further identified and validated a number of previously undescribed functional genes interrupted by cnvs, including five genes in the coding regions and  <dig> in non-coding regions . osmads <dig> , which consists of eight exons, encodes a typical mikc-type mads-box protein. overexpression of osmads <dig> resulted in delayed flowering under long day condition, while a loss-of-function mutation had no alterations in timing of flowering  <cit> . a cnv encompassing the first exon of osmads <dig> resulted in partial deletion of the mads-box domain .fig.  <dig> pcr validation of cnvs in osmads <dig> and bph <dig>  a schematic gene structure and cnv position of osmads <dig>  f1: 5’-tcgtcgagccatttcggg-3’ and r1: 5’-ccatttgtagtctcgcacgctc-3’. b schematic gene structure and cnv position of bph <dig>  f1: 5’-atcagggtccaccagcgaga-3’ and r1: 5’-gccagccagcaaaatatcttta-3’. pcr validations were performed in  <dig> rice accessions. blue boxes stand for cds; white boxes depict utr; inverted triangles indicate cnv positions



bph <dig>  confers resistance to brown planthopper in rice. it encodes a coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding, and leucine-rich repeat  protein. the sequence variations in lrr domain are responsible for the function in insect resistance  <cit> . a cnv spanning the entire bph <dig> gene was detected and validated by pcr experiments .

osdcl2b , a dicer-like gene, participates in the regulation of gene silencing at the post-transcriptional level by rna interference  <cit> . a large cnv  enclosing osdcl2b was identified. local alignments showed that this fragment was present in the o. sativa, but absent in oryza nivara, oryza barthii, oryza glumaepatula, oryza meridionalis and oryza punctata, implying it was actually an insertion in o. sativa. further analysis verified that osdcl2b is a duplication of osdcl2a as part of a large segmental duplication from chromosome  <dig> to  <dig> , which is consistent with a previous report  <cit> .fig.  <dig> pcr validation of cnvs in osdcl2b and osmads <dig>  a the cnv enclosing osdcl2b was not present in orthologous regions of o. nivara, o. barthii, o. glaberrima, o. glumaepatula, o. meridionalis, and o. punctata. osdcl2b  was duplicated from osdcl2a  as part of a large segmental duplication. b the cnv covering the last two exons of osmads <dig> was present in o. sativa, but not in o. nivara, o. barthii, o. glaberrima, o. glumaepatula, o. meridionalis, and o. punctata. this fragment was duplicated from a genomic region enclosing os06g <dig> on the same chromosome. gray horizontal lines, orthologous regions of the oryza species; green lines, cnvs; yellow lines, homologous regions of cnv; gray vertical lines, genes; gray boxes; exons. orthologous genes are connected by red lines. homologous genes are connected by blue lines



osmads <dig>  encodes mikc-type mads-box protein, and participates in the response to dehydration and salt stress  <cit> . a cnv spanning the last two exons of osmads <dig> was detected. comparative sequence analysis demonstrated that this cnv was only present in o. sativa, indicating that it is an evolutionarily recent insertion. this fragment was duplicated from a genomic region enclosing loc_os06g <dig> on the same chromosome . therefore, osmads <dig> was a new gene formed by gene fusion in o. sativa.

formation mechanisms of non-co-linear cnv genes
many cnv genes are actually insertions in nipponbare, thus form non-co-linear genes in the oryza species. among  <dig> conserved genes whose coding regions were affected by cnvs,  <dig> of them are non-co-linear; majority of them  have a homolog in the nipponbare genome with sequence identity ranging from 80 % to 100 % , implying that these non-co-linear genes were possibly duplicated from other places in the genome .fig.  <dig> sequence analysis of the origin of non-co-linear cnv genes. the regions containing non-co-linear cnv genes were compared with orthologous regions in o. glaberrima. a the non-co-linear cnv gene loc_os05g <dig> was a duplicate of loc_os12g <dig>  b a cnv containing loc_os05g <dig> was duplicated from a segment spanning loc_os12g32130



although studies have been conducted to reveal mechanisms of non-co-linear genes in drosophila  <cit>  and plants , ancient gene transposition provided insufficient sources of clues due to sequence decay by random mutations. comparison of more closely related species will increase the power of evolutionary inference. in this study, the divergence time between o. sativa and o. glaberrima is less than  <dig> million years  <cit> . a recent duplication event would leave an ancestral copy in the original syntenic position. by comparative sequence analysis, diagnostic motifs such as target site duplications and precise borders can be identified, and thereby, mechanisms underlying the formation of non-co-linear cnv genes can be inferred more precisely.

here, we focused on high-scoring homologous gene pairs which are at least 90 % identical. the non-co-linear genes  were aligned to their respective ancestral copies, and the mechanisms underlying their formation were deduced by examining signatures of breakpoints. transposable elements flanked both sides of the non-co-linear genes, implying that these duplication events were possibly mediated by te activity ; micro-homology or no homology at breakpoints between the non-co-linear cnv gene and its ancestral copy indicate that nhej  appears to be at play during dsb repair process ; high homology at breakpoints support the role of nahr  . in total,  <dig> cases were formed by tes,  <dig> cases by nhej, and  <dig> case by nahr .fig.  <dig> formation mechanisms of non-co-linear cnv genes inferred by signature of breakpoint. a by comparison to the ancestral gene os01g <dig>  mutator-like elements flanked both sides of os12g <dig>  implying that this duplication event was possibly mediated by te activity. b micro-homology at breakpoints between os06g <dig> and os06g <dig> indicated this duplication was mediated by nhej  during dsb repair process. c high homology at breakpoint between os11g <dig> and os11g <dig> indicated the role of nahr . black boxes, genes; green boxes, mutator-like elements; red characters, homologous sequences between the non-co-linear gene and its ancestral copy



we next sought to determine the formation mechanisms of the entire cnv dataset. with the benefit of single base-pair resolution, the relative contribution of each mutational mechanism can be defined. we applied the breakseq pipeline, which scans specific diagnostic sequence signatures at breakpoint junctions to infer the formation mechanism of each cnv  <cit> . eventually,  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  were found to be formed by nhr  and mei , respectively, and  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  by nahr and vntr, respectively. the remaining  <dig>  %  was too ambiguous to be defined . by relating the formation mechanisms to cnv size, we observed a broad size range in mei, nahr, and nhr, whereas there was a relatively small range of cnv sizes in vntr .fig.  <dig> cnv formation mechanisms acted on the rice genome. a distribution of different cnv formation mechanisms . outer circle represents number of cnvs per mechanism. inner circle represents cumulative genomic size of these events. b, c spatial distribution of cnvs formed by different formation mechanisms on the  <dig> chromosomes. the color represents different mechanisms as in . d cnv size comparison formed by different mechanisms



discussion
although structural variations >100 bp in length have been identified for this resequencing data, the breakpoint cannot be precisely determined due to limitation of the read-depth method  <cit> . in this study, we re-generated the variation by three complementary short read-based surveys, which can improve the confidence of cnv events and the precision of cnv boundaries. based on this cnv map, we emphasized the impact and origin of this type of genomic variation.

most cnvs are actually insertions in o. sativa, which implies that insertions are predominant in the rice genome evolution. a recently published paper also showed that natural insertions in rice were commonly occurred  <cit> . these results are consistent with previous reports that the rice genome has experienced massive recent amplifications in the last two million years  <cit> .

in this study, we detected and validated  <dig> functional cnv genes. the coding regions of five genes were affected by cnvs, including osmads <dig>  bph <dig>  osdcl2b, osmads <dig> and oswaky <dig>  because of their important functions, we envision that the variation in these genes may have functional consequences. however, genes identified, as with cnv genes reported previously, are all members of multigene families. the deletion or duplication of cnv genes can be genetically buffered. therefore, genes affected by cnvs may contribute to quantitative rather than qualitative variations .

cnv genes tend to locate in regions with low levels of conservation among species. nearly 58 %  cnv genes are rice-specific; among the remaining  <dig> conserved cnv genes, 41 % are non-co-linear ones. the gene order in animal genomes has been conserved over millions of years, while co-linearity in plants genomes was dramatically disturbed  <cit> . the number of co-linear genes decreases with increasing phylogenetic distances. recent works indicated that many non-transposon genes and gene families are capable of moving in plants  <cit> . one possible mechanism is dna-based “copy and paste” mediated by transposons or recombination. transposons can occasionally “capture” genic sequence fragments and move them to other locations in the genome, such as mutator  <cit> , helitron  <cit> , and ltr retrotransposons  <cit> . an alternative mechanism of gene capture is the repair of dsb by nahr, nhej or mmej. this study indicated that both transposon activity and recombination were involved in the formation of cnv genes in rice.

in this study, we were unable to provide the direct link between cnvs and phenotypes, which is rather challenging by using reverse genetic approaches. however, we believe that this cnv map will be of great value for future association studies by either eqtl  or gwas  to relate cnv genotypes to phenotypes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
by three complementary ngs-based methods, we performed genome-wide cnv detection based on published sequencing data of  <dig> rice accessions. the study demonstrated that  <dig> functional genes were disrupted by cnvs, and the main mechanisms of cnv formation in rice were nhr and mei. we foresee that this cnv map will be of great value for studying genome evolution and phenotypic variation in the oryza species.
