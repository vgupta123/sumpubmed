BACKGROUND
during normal embryonic development, the tight regulation of cell fate decisions is absolutely required and differentiated phenotype is generally conferred by the transcription factor profile. in some cases a complete change of cellular identity can be driven by ectopic expression of one or a combination of such factors. for instance, fibroblasts can be reverted to pluripotency by introduction of the transcription factors oct <dig>  sox <dig>  klf <dig> and c-myc  <cit> . studies have also highlighted the potential of the basic helix-loop-helix  family of transcription factors to induce fate reprogramming of mature cells, converting cells from one differentiated phenotype into another: for example, exogenous myod is capable of reprogramming mouse fibroblasts to myocytes  <cit> , and ngn <dig>  pdx <dig> and mafa can convert liver cells into pancreatic beta cells in vivo <cit> . while transcription factor expression and activity can be manipulated in vitro and in vivo to generate cells of a specific phenotype, it is clear that in vivo such transcription factor networks are tightly regulated to maintain phenotypic stability, and prevent inappropriate activation that might lead to dysregulation of the maintenance of cell fate. whilst most efforts have focused on elucidating regulation of lineage-specific transcription factors at the level of gene expression, emerging evidence increasingly points to post-translational modification as a key regulator of transcriptional networks in response to the cellular environment  <cit> .

neurogenin <dig>  is a bhlh transcription factor that regulates the transition from neural progenitor to differentiating neuron. for instance, ngn <dig> is involved in the formation of sensory neurons from the epibranchial placode  <cit>  and neurogenesis in dorsal root ganglia  <cit> , where it acts to determine the fate of progenitor cells as neuronal precursors and also to repress glial cell fates using separate mechanisms  <cit> , <cit> . furthermore, cell cycle exit and cell motility are regulated by ngn <dig>  <cit> , while experimentally, differentiation of neural stem cells can be induced by transfection of ngn <dig>  <cit> , <cit> . to undertake these roles, ngn <dig> acts to upregulate a large number of downstream targets, including a cascade of additional bhlh transcription factors, such as neurod, as well as structural and functional genes associated with mature neuronal activity  <cit> . for transcriptional activity at its targets, ngn <dig> has an obligate heterodimeric dna binding partner, e12/e <dig>  and this heterodimer binds to dna, recruiting transcriptional coactivators such as p300/cbp and brg <dig> to facilitate target upregulation  <cit> , <cit> . however, ngn <dig> is expressed in neural progenitor cells prior to their differentiation  <cit> , implying that its neurogenic activity must be suppressed until a permissive environment exists. such regulation is likely to occur at the level of post-translational control of protein activity, which in turn is likely to be both dependent on and a regulator of protein tertiary and quaternary structure, although the higher order structure of ngn <dig> is poorly characterised.

proteins carry out various roles in the cell as a function of their structure. enzymes require specific active site conformations in order to carry out catalysis and structural proteins require particular conformations to achieve mechanical strength. however it has become apparent that many functional proteins are, in fact, not natively folded at all times in the cell  <cit> . proteins that are natively unfolded and lacking regular structure are termed intrinsically disordered  proteins  <cit> . id proteins show a lack of hydrophobicity  <cit>  and extreme isoelectric point  values due to a large net charge from a high prevalence of charged residues . it has also been suggested that there is an increased rate of evolution in id segments and proteins  <cit> . therefore it may be that in these regions there is a lack of function allowing unconstrained mutation; or perhaps the function of the protein requires disorder itself and so a lack of evolutionary constraint on specific sequence allows a larger amount of variability. an investigation of the gene ontology terms associated with id proteins highlights a significant number of proteins that are involved in dna-binding, transcription activation and that act as transcription factors  <cit> . in these cases, intrinsic disorder would appear to regulate protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid binding interactions, as thermodynamically this gives flexibility to signaling processes and the assembly of complexes in the cell. the free energy of binding is counteracted by the free energy required to fold the structure and so overall there is only a small free energy change  <cit> .

while such a small free energy change would be predicted to allow only a low affinity of binding, there is a trade-off achieved with high specificity, through a requirement for the correct binding interactions and easy reversibility  <cit> . so small are the energy differences involved, that this may result in minor changes to the structure of a protein, but dramatic alterations to the formation of multi-factor complexes. for example, this may allow fine tweaking of transcription dynamics, to form promoter complexes with dna-binding cycles of various time periods leading to differential activation of various downstream targets  <cit> , <cit> . id proteins exhibit less transcriptional noise in expression than structured proteins and so appear to be tightly regulated at the point of their destruction  <cit> , which also may further lead to tight control of downstream target gene expression. there is a high correlation between specific amino acid composition of id proteins and phosphorylation sites, suggesting that phosphorylation may be promoted in disordered regions  <cit> . furthermore, id proteins are targeted by twice as many kinases as structured proteins  <cit> . many of those kinases whose substrates are mainly unstructured proteins also tend to be regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner  <cit> .

ngn <dig> exhibits some of the features common to id proteins: there are a large number of charged residues leading to a low level of hydrophobicity  <cit>  and the protein runs at a higher molecular mass  than its predicted molecular mass   <cit> . ngn <dig> also shares many similarities with id proteins with regard to amino acid composition  <cit> , function  <cit>  and stabilization upon the binding of other cofactors  <cit> , <cit> . bhlh proteins show significant sequence homology in the bhlh domain only  <cit>  and large sequence variability in the flanking regions, as is found in the evolutionary comparison of related id proteins  <cit> , again indicating the potential for large disordered regions in ngn <dig>  there is no published structural information for ngn <dig> but a limited number of crystal structures are available for bhlh family homologues such as myod and neurod, bound to e <dig> as a heterodimer to dna  <cit> , <cit> . bhlh protein crystal structures exclude the n- and c-terminal regions outside of the bhlh domain  <cit> , as these regions are predicted to be disordered and thus will reduce the ability to purify, and therefore crystalise, the protein  <cit> .

the stability of many bhlh proteins is regulated by phosphorylation events, e.g. myod  <cit> . our previous work has highlighted that ngn <dig> is a highly unstable protein  <cit> , <cit> - <cit> , which appears to be highly phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner at serine-proline  sites  <cit> , <cit> . the relationship between the stability of ngn <dig> and its phosphorylation status has been only briefly explored previously  <cit> , <cit>  but a direct link between phosphorylation at sp sites and the stability of ngn <dig> has not been investigated. in this work we explore the effects of phosphorylation at specific sp sites of ngn <dig> on the activity and structure of the protein. we find that phosphorylation of ngn <dig> has no significant effect on its intrinsic stability. mutation of phosphorylation sites in both the n- and c-terminal regions contributes to enhanced ngn <dig> neuronal differentiation activity and further mutational analysis confirms that it is the number, and not position, of phosphorylation sites available that controls protein activity in vivo. finally, we also present the first structural validation by nmr of full-length ngn <dig> protein, and directly demonstrate phosphorylation in the n-terminal region of mngn <dig> by nmr spectroscopy.

RESULTS
mutation of conserved and non-conserved sp phosphorylation sites does not significantly alter ngnprotein half-life in vitro
if specific phosphorylation sites act to regulate ngn <dig> activity then we would expect such sites to be highly conserved across species, in line with the conservation of ngn <dig> function. all available ncbi ngn <dig> protein sequences were aligned using the clustal w <dig> multiple sequence alignment tool , and compared to xenopus laevis ngn <dig> , where multi-site phosphorylation and stability have been best characterised  <cit> , <cit> - <cit> . the ngn <dig> bhlh domain was defined by homology to the myod and neurod bhlh domains as lying between glycine  <dig> and leucine  <dig> of the xngn <dig> sequence . compared to human ngn <dig> , the sequence most divergent from xngn <dig>  the xngn <dig> bhlh domain shows 84% conservation and 99% similarity and thus appears to be highly conserved, in agreement with previously published studies . by contrast, the n-terminal region of xngn <dig> shows 24% conservation and 70% similarity and the c-terminal region of xngn <dig> shows 31% conservation and 74% similarity to hngn <dig>  the n- and c-terminal regions are therefore not as highly conserved as the bhlh domain but both show a similar extent of conservation compared to each other.

ngn <dig> has previously been shown to be phosphorylated on serines of serine-proline  sites  <cit> , <cit> , while threonine-proline  sites may also be potential sites of phosphorylation. there are no sp or tp sites present in the bhlh domain of any species. surprisingly, given the poor conservation of sequence overall, three of the four sp sites  in the c-terminal region of xngn <dig> are highly conserved with all other species whilst the other sp site is close in the primary sequence to a site conserved in other species. these sites include the two residues identified as glycogen synthase kinase 3?  phosphorylation sites in mngn <dig>  <cit> . by contrast, despite the presence of  <dig> sp sites in the n-terminal region of xngn <dig>  a highly conserved sp site is seen in the n-terminal region of other species but this is not conserved in xngn <dig>  although we have previously shown that in general it is the number of sp site phosphorylation events that is critical for regulating ngn <dig> function in vitro rather than their precise location  <cit> , <cit> , nevertheless, the conservation of sp site locations raises the possibility that sp or tp phosphorylation sites in the c-terminal region may be particularly important for the regulation of ngn <dig> function. we have explored this possibility here by investigating further the protein stability and function of xngn <dig> mutants where specific combinations of sp sites are mutated to prevent their phosphorylation.

to assess the role of sp site phosphorylation in the regulation of ngn <dig> stability and function, we generated mutant versions of xngn <dig> in which either n- or c-terminal region sp sites were mutated to alanine-proline  to generate nt-s-axngn <dig> and ct-s-axngn <dig>  respectively . we first analysed protein stability in mitotic xenopus egg extracts that have been previously shown to maximally phosphorylate ngn <dig> at sp sites  <cit> . nt-s-axngn <dig> and ct-s-axngn <dig> protein stabilities were compared to those of wild-type xngn <dig> and a mutant version of xngn <dig> in which all sp sites are mutated to ap and which demonstrates a dramatically increased neuronal differentiation activity in vivo in xenopus frog embryos .

to investigate the effect of mutation of n- and c-terminal region sp sites on protein stability, 35s-radiolabelled in vitro translated  xngn <dig>  9s-axngn <dig>  nt-s-axngn <dig> and ct-s-axngn <dig> were added to xenopus mitotic egg extract and samples removed at increasing timepoints. proteins were separated by 15% sds-page and subjected to autoradiography to allow measurement of protein levels over time and calculation of the half-life for degradation using first-order rate kinetics   <cit> , <cit> . in this assay, xngn <dig> had a half-life of  <dig>  +/?  <dig>  mins. although the trend is towards increased stability, 9s-axngn <dig> shows no statistically significant difference compared to wild-type ngn <dig>  with a half-life of  <dig>  +/?  <dig>  mins. nt-s-axngn <dig> has a half-life of  <dig>  +/?  <dig>  mins, while ct-s-axngn <dig> has a half-life of  <dig>  +/?  <dig>  mins. both mutant versions therefore tend towards increased stability compared to wild-type xngn <dig>  but again variability in repeat assays means that no statistically significant difference in stability was observed. therefore, we have directly demonstrated that phosphorylation status of ngn <dig> does not directly control its stability in xenopus.

sp sites in both the n- and c-terminal regions regulate the activity of xngn2
previous work has indicated that preventing xngn <dig> phosphorylation on all  <dig> sp sites enhances its ability to drive neuronal differentiation in vitro and in vivo <cit> , <cit> . we have observed phosphorylation of xngn <dig> at sp sites in both the n- and c-terminal regions following incubation in xenopus mitotic egg extract  <cit> . assaying the activity of a sequential mutant series of mouse ngn <dig>  where sp sites were additively mutated from the c-terminus  showed an incremental increase in neuronal differentiation activity in vitro with the loss of each additional sp site  <cit> , <cit> . in addition, analysis of the in vivo neuronal differentiation activity of a single sp site knock-in series allowed us to determine that phosphorylation at individual sp sites could not account for regulation of the neuronal differentiation activity of xngn <dig>  <cit> . however, these analyses did not allow us to determine the contribution of the n- and c-terminal region sp sites to the phospho-regulation of the neuronal differentiation activity of mngn <dig>  nor whether one region played a more prominent regulatory role than the other. mngn <dig> has only two n-terminal sp sites and previous assays  <cit>  showed in fact that their mutation had a minimal effect on the differentiation of p <dig> cells, which respond to overexpression of proneural proteins by undergoing neuronal differentiation  <cit> . this points to increased prominence for c-terminal phosphorylation events for ngn <dig> regulation. however, it was unclear whether the mngn <dig> n-terminal sp sites had only minimal effects on the neuronal dif-ferentiation-inducing ability of ngn <dig> because there are only two of them or because phosphorylation of sites in the n-terminus of ngn <dig> plays an intrinsically lesser role in regulating ngn <dig> activity than phosphorylation of sites in the c-terminus for domain structure/function reasons. by contrast to mngn <dig>  xngn <dig> has five sp sites in the n-terminus. we investigated whether the larger number of potential phosphorylation sites in xngn <dig> compared to mngn <dig> results in a greater contribution of n-terminal phosphorylation to regulation of xngn <dig> activity relative to mngn <dig>  or whether n-terminal phosphorylation, regardless of number of sites available, plays little role in phospho-regulation of the neuronal differentiation activity of ngn <dig> protein.

to assess whether preventing phosphorylation at the conserved sp sites in the c-terminus of xngn <dig> alone was sufficient to maximally activate the protein, we compared the neuronal differentiation activity of xngn <dig>  ct-s-axngn <dig> and 9s-axngn <dig> in vivo in xenopus embryos. to this end, mrnas encoding xngn <dig>  ct-s-axngn <dig> and 9s-axngn <dig> were generated and overexpressed in  <dig> cell of  <dig> cell xenopus embryos, and an assessment of ectopic neurogenesis was performed as previously described, comparing the injected and the uninjected side  <cit> . as expected, 9s-axngn <dig> had significantly higher neuronal differentiation activity than wild-type xngn <dig>  <cit> , <cit> . the overexpression of ct-s-axngn <dig> resulted in a level of ectopic neurogenesis intermediate between that of overexpressed wild-type xngn <dig> and 9s-axngn <dig> , indicating that phosphorylation on the n-terminus of xngn <dig> does indeed contribute to limiting xngn <dig> neuronal differentiation activity. to further investigate the neuronal differentiation activity of the mutants in vivo, we then quantified the expression of the direct downstream xngn <dig> target xneurod by qrt-pcr in response to overexpression of xngn <dig>  nt-s-axngn <dig>  ct-s-axngn <dig> and 9s-axngn <dig> in  <dig> cell-stage xenopus embryos . both nt-s-axngn <dig> and ct-s-axngn <dig> showed an intermediate neuronal differentiation activity between that of xngn <dig> and 9s-axngn <dig>  demonstrating that phosphorylation at sp sites in both the n- and c-terminal regions of xngn <dig> contributes to regulating its transcriptional activity. therefore, in addition to our previous work highlighting the importance of the number of sp sites for regulation of neuronal differentiation activity, we show clearly here that sp sites in both the n- and c-terminal domains can contribute to regulation of protein function.

in vivo activity of xngnis a semi-quantitative measure of phospho-site availability
p <dig> embryonal carcinoma cells respond to ectopic ngn <dig> expression by undergoing neuronal differentiation in vitro <cit> . our previous data in p <dig> cells with a cumulative phospho-mutant series of mngn <dig> proteins  had suggested that the number of sp sites available for phosphorylation act semi-quantitatively to regulate the neuronal differentiation activity of ngn <dig>  <cit> , <cit> . the results presented above support the hypothesis that phospho-regulation of ngn <dig> is not strictly dependent on the position or level of conservation of the sp site that is modified but rather on the number of sp sites available. to confirm this in vivo, we overexpressed a cumulative phospho-mutant series of xngn <dig> proteins, this time where sp sites were additively mutated from the n-terminus , in  <dig> cell of  <dig> cell xenopus embryos, to semi-quantitatively assay the multi-site phos-pho-regulation of xngn2?s neuronal differentiation activity in vivo. embryos were subjected to in situ hybridization for neural ?-tubulin expression and the injected and uninjected sides compared as above . as additional sp sites were mutated from the n-terminus, we saw that the neuronal differentiation activity of the mutant xngn <dig> proteins progressively increased, finally reaching maximal activity when all  <dig> sp sites were mutated in 9s-axngn <dig>  strikingly, when taken with data demonstrating a gradual increase in mngn <dig> activity in p <dig> cells in vitro as sp sites are cumulatively mutated from the c-terminus  <cit> , these data demonstrate conclusively that the precise location of sp sites is not of major importance for the phospho-regulation of ngn <dig> activity, but rather it is the number of sp sites available for modification that is critical for controlling ngn <dig> activity in vivo and in vitro. compared to our previous data showing the effect of serial loss of sp sites from the c-terminal end of the protein in vitro, we now show, in vivo, that the reciprocal mutation series from the n-terminus of the protein behaves in a similar way. we can clearly now demonstrate that it is neither specific sp sites, nor their location in a particular protein domain, but rather it is the absolute number of phosphorylation sites, that determines ngn <dig> protein activity.

ngnproteins are predicted to be intrinsically disordered outside the bhlh domain
the results presented above, taken together with data in  <cit>  and  <cit> , strongly support the hypothesis that the ability of xngn <dig> to drive neuronal differentiation is regulated by modification on multiple sp sites and that it is the number of sp sites available for modification and not their position that is the prime determinant of neuronal differentiation activity. structural consequences of phosphorylation could suggest a molecular mechanism for the multi-site phospho-regulation of ngn <dig> activity but the structure of phosphorylated regions of ngn <dig> has not been explored.

by analogy with other bhlh proteins, it seems very likely that the n- and c-terminal regions of ngn <dig> are intrinsically disordered. ngn <dig> exhibits some of the features of id proteins: there are a large number of charged residues leading to a low level of hydrophobicity  <cit> ; and the protein runs at a higher molecular mass  than its calculated molecular mass   <cit> . computational analysis of the extent of protein disorder using pondr-fit , predicts a high degree of disorder in the n- and c-terminal regions of xenopus  and mouse  ngn <dig>  with a highly ordered section in the middle of the sequence corresponding to the bhlh domain. both xenopus and mouse ngn <dig> exhibit low sequence conservation in the n- and c-terminal regions  but these regions in both proteins are predicted to be similarly highly disordered , further disorder predictions were carried out with mouse ngn <dig> in order to compare the results from various predictors.

disopred <dig>  is a prediction algorithm that has been developed using empirically determined standards from experimental datasets. disopred <dig> predicts that mngn <dig> contains highly disordered n- and c-terminal regions flanking a folded region , in agreement with the pondr-fit prediction . foldindex  uses the hydrophobicity and charge of the residues within the amino acid sequence to predict disordered regions and in agreement with the other algorithms, predicts disordered regions in mngn <dig> at the n- and c-terminal regions interspaced by a folded region . however, compared to the previous predictions , foldindex predicts the folded region to be shifted towards the n-terminus and to be much larger. this correlates with the distribution of hydrophobic and charged residues in mngn <dig> . therefore whilst ngn <dig>  and other bhlh proteins, may not be disordered across their entire length, empirical observations relating to the difficulties of protein purification  <cit> , together with the disorder predictions for mngn <dig> described above, suggest that intrinsically disordered regions are present.

nmr spectroscopy runs into a size problem for folded proteins because of increased tumbling time with concomitant enhanced line broadening of the signals  <cit> . by contrast, in id proteins the fast molecular internal dynamics contribute to longer relaxation times compared to folded proteins of the same size, and result in narrow resonances that allow good detection and resolution  <cit> . using this property of the nmr signal, we set out to determine whether we could detect the disordered regions of ngn <dig> and phosphorylation events therein.

characterization of mouse ngn <dig> conformation in solution and mapping of mouse ngn <dig> phosphorylation sites using nmr spectroscopy
in order to directly confirm sp or tp sites in mngn <dig> as targets for phosphorylation and to obtain further information on its secondary structure, a bacterially-expressed gst-mngn <dig> fusion protein was 15n, or 15n, 13c isotopically-labelled for nmr spectroscopy analysis. mouse ngn <dig> was chosen, as although both mouse and xenopus ngn <dig> have been well-characterized  <cit> , <cit> , previous attempts to purify xenopus ngn <dig> had been unsuccessful and it was hoped that mouse ngn <dig>  codon-optimized for bacterial expression, might prove more tractable . despite the limited solubility of full-length phosphorylated mngn <dig> , after cleavage of the gst carrier protein, we were still able to obtain a 2d 1h, 15n hsqc spectrum with close to  <dig> resonances . the poor dispersion of the signal on the 1h scale indicates that the detected regions are disordered in nature, confirming the primary sequence-based predictions .

to investigate phosphorylation events in its disordered regions, recombinant mngn <dig> protein was phosphorylated in vitro by incubation with recombinant cyclina/cdk <dig> kinase, which was previously shown to phosphorylate xngn <dig>  and regulates xngn <dig> activity in vivo <cit> . analysis of the phosphorylated forms of mngn <dig> using 2d nmr spectroscopy showed  <dig> new resonances that were absent in the 2d spectrum of the unphosphorylated form of mngn <dig>  in the region expected for pser and pthr residues .

assignment of the backbone atom resonances of mngn <dig> was performed based on 3d experiments on the 15n, 13c doubly-labelled protein . this assignment does not cover the full-length protein: the detected domains correspond to residues  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig>  containing two sp sites and one tp site. comparison with the secondary structure prediction based on the primary sequence confirms that these regions of the protein are located outside of the bhlh domain and are not predicted to adopt stable secondary structures . although these regions are disordered, closer examination of their chemical shifts by comparison with databases of chemical shifts of strictly random coil polymers  <cit>  would suggest a local tendency to adopt transient secondary structure. using the secondary structure propensity analysis, we observed a positive deviation of the experimental chemical shifts in segments aa15- <dig> and aa67- <dig> of the protein, consistent with the adoption of transient alpha-helical structure. however, a negative deviation in the c-terminal region between aa49- <dig> is indicative of a tendency to adopt an extended conformation . the phosphorylated sites therefore reside in regions of high intrinsic disorder.

we next used the carbon signals in the 3d experiments to identify the phosphorylated residues  <cit> , <cit> . the ca and cb chemical shifts allow discrimination of a ps from a pt residue  <cit> , while the ca- <dig> and cb- <dig> resonances will inform on the nature of the amino acid at the n-terminus . cdks are proline-directed kinases and a proline at the i?+? <dig> position will alter the ca chemical shift by a +2 ppm deviation compared to the chemical shift expected for a ps or pt  <cit> . phosphorylated residues were thus identified as ps <dig>  pt <dig> and ps <dig>  which are sp and tp sites conserved between xngn <dig> and mngn <dig> .

this is the first structural information obtained by nmr for full-length ngn <dig> protein and it directly demonstrates the intrinsic disorder inherent to the protein, a characteristic of ngn <dig> previously only predicted by using protein folding computational algorithms. in addition we have directly shown that protein phosphorylation in vitro can be mediated by cyclina/cdk <dig> within the intrinsically disordered domain.

discussion
studies are revealing the remarkable plasticity of fully differentiated somatic cells when exposed to an exogenous set of transcription factors. from the now well established transcription factor cocktails that promote reprogramming to an induced pluripotent cell state  <cit>  through to reprogramming to induced neurons  <cit> , the power of specific transcription factor networks to determine cell fate even in the absence of the normal physiological environment or developmental stage is well accepted. however, such transcription factor networks must regularly be broken and replaced during embryonic development, implying a tight regulation of the transcription factors themselves and mechanisms for restraining their activities. although post-translational methods of regulation, such as phosphorylation and protein degradation, are beginning to be more widely investigated  <cit> , mechanisms integrating different forms of post-translational regulation have been poorly studied. we have previously described regulation of the proneural bhlh transcription factor ngn <dig> by both ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and cell cycle-mediated phosphorylation at sp sites  <cit> , <cit> - <cit> . in this study, we have explored possible links between these modes of regulation and investigated in greater depth the regulation and structural consequences of ngn <dig> by phosphorylation at sp sites.

by comparing the protein primary sequence of xngn <dig> to homologues in other species , it is clear that conservation of ngn <dig> sequence outside of the bhlh domain is poor. strikingly, however, conservation of sp sites in the c-terminal region is very high, and more so than the conservation of sp sites in the n-terminal region. as ngn <dig> is a highly unstable protein, we investigated whether phosphorylation of these sites might influence protein half-life. despite conservation, mutation of sp sites in the c-terminal region of xngn <dig> had no significant effect on protein stability, nor did mutation of n-terminal sp sites , indicating that phosphorylation on these sites does not regulate the intrinsic stability of the protein. however, assays of stability in this in vitro system do not preclude the possibility that phosphorylation of ngn <dig> could indirectly influence protein stability, for instance by affecting its ability to associate with binding partners not present in egg extract. both n- and c-terminal sp sites regulate the overall neurogenic activity of xngn <dig> in vivo  but our data taken together indicate  that control of intrinsic protein stability is not the major mechanism by which phosphorylation at sp sites of xngn <dig> acts to control neuronal differentiation activity.

we went on to expand upon our previous observations  <cit> , <cit>  and to explore further whether the position of sp sites has a major influence on their ability to regulate the neuronal differentiation activity of xngn <dig> by using phosphomutant ngn2s in vivo in developing embryos. in contrast to mngn <dig>  where mutation of its two n-terminal sp sites did not significantly enhance its neurogenic activity in vitro in p <dig> cells, sp sites in both the n- and c-terminal regions of xngn <dig> contribute to regulation of its neuronal differentiation activity in vivo in xenopus embryos . our previous observation in vitro that it is the number and not position of sp sites which is the determinant of ngn <dig> neuronal differentiation activity  <cit>  was confirmed in vivo in xenopus embryos using a series of xngn <dig> mutants in which sp sites had been cumulatively changed to ap sites, beginning from the n-terminus . these results, using assays of activity in vivo, clearly reinforce a model suggested by in vitro data  <cit>  that it is the number, and not position, of phosphorylation events at sp sites in ngn <dig> that regulate its neuronal differentiation activity.

as it is not the precise location but the number of phospho-sites available that regulates ngn <dig> activity, this led us to consider whether structural plasticity associated with intrinsic disorder might facilitate such regulation. in this regard, previous studies suggested that these regions might be intrinsically disordered  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . id proteins show an increased rate of evolution in disordered regions and both xenopus and mouse ngn <dig> exhibit low sequence conservation in the n- and c-terminal regions .

the purification of bhlh proteins is problematic as illustrated by the work of aguado-lllera et al.  <cit> . the authors attempted to purify the bhlh domain of ngn <dig> using his-tagged, gst-tagged, maltose binding protein-tagged, biotin-tagged and thioredoxin-tagged protein constructs in bl <dig>  rosetta, c <dig> and bl21plys cells with induction at several different temperatures and with varying concentrations of iptg. only one combination appeared to work at all but the protein was found to be partially degraded. the authors finally turned to chemical synthesis of the bhlh domain of ngn <dig> instead. indeed, bhlh protein crystal structure determination is usually performed on a protein devoid of the n- and c-terminal regions  as these regions have previously been predicted to be disordered. however, some evidence exists that even within the bhlh domain bound to both its heterodimeric binding partner and e-box dna there is still a tendency towards disorder  <cit> . disorder-predicting programs are based upon protein sequence information alone and the in vivo environment is not yet accurately reproducible in silico. nevertheless, the predictions performed here  do correlate well for both xenopus and mouse ngn <dig> and suggest that a high degree of disorder is likely, particularly in the n- and c-terminal regions. the foldindex prediction  correlates least with the other predictions. however, foldindex places a greater bias upon the hydrophobicity and charge of the residues in the peptide sequence  <cit>  and whilst this is usually a good predictor of intrinsic disorder  <cit>  there may be circumstances under which it is insufficient.

to directly investigate the level of disorder within the regions of ngn <dig>  we attempted to purify mngn <dig> and investigate its tertiary structure and phosphorylation by nmr. unsurprisingly, the purification of mngn <dig> proved to be difficult; previous attempts to purify xngn <dig>  using both bacterial expression and baculovirus systems had been largely unsuccessful . sarkosyl-based treatment  <cit>  resulted in the liberation of some his-mngn <dig> from the insoluble fraction of the cell lysate. solubility of the protein was greatly improved by using a gst-tag and we were able to isolate gst-mngn <dig> from the soluble fraction instead . despite these difficulties, we were able to purify a sufficient quantity of protein to obtain unambiguous nmr spectra, although signals originate from only the n-terminal region of the protein. the nmr spectra for mngn <dig> demonstrated that the n-terminal region of the protein was disordered, and that serines  <dig> and  <dig> and threonine  <dig> are phosphorylated in vitro by cyclina/cdk <dig> . that the nmr results comprise spectra allowing the identification of phosphorylated sp and tp sites in the n-terminal region, conserved between xngn <dig> and mngn <dig>  illustrates not only direct phosphorylation of sp sites by cyclina/cdk <dig> in vitro but also that this occurs in the disordered n-terminal region. this structural evidence for the disordered n-terminal domain, and the phosphorylation which modifies it, provide a direct demonstration of phosphorylation of ngn <dig>  and compliment previous work inferring phosphorylation by using extract systems in vitro and by using activity assays of phospho-mutant ngn <dig> in vivo.

our data demonstrate that the n-terminal region is intrinsically disordered and argue for a role for id regions as integrators of signaling leading to tight regulation of the neuronal differentiation activity of ngn <dig>  intrinsically disordered regions may well be enriched in post-translational modifications  <cit> , making them ideal for integration of different signaling events and post-translational mechanisms of regulation. such regulation is critical for normal development and the role of disordered regions highlights an alternative to the more widely established mechanism of switching between rigidly structured forms upon post-translational modification. our data support our previous findings that it is the number, and not position, of phosphorylation sites available that controls ngn <dig> neuronal differentiation activity  <cit> , <cit> . this is similar to another process involving cell cycle regulation in the process of differentiation, namely the role of the ste <dig> protein in map kinase signaling in yeast  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
phosphorylation at serine-proline  sites in ngn <dig> occurs in both the n- and c-terminal regions, located either side of the bhlh domain, and this phosphorylation does not alter the intrinsic stability of ngn <dig> protein. multi-site phosphorylation of sp sites inhibits the neuronal differentiation activity of ngn <dig> protein, but it is the total number of phospho-sites available, rather than their precise sequence location or approximate location within a particular domain within the ngn <dig> protein, that controls the ability of ngn <dig> to drive neuronal differentiation in vivo in xenopus embryos. we find that the n-and c-terminal regions of ngn <dig> are intrinsically disordered and we have taken advantage of the disordered nature of the mngn <dig> protein, and the ability to gain structural information about the n-terminal domain in particular, to observe phosphorylation by cyclina/cdk <dig> kinase in vitro on an intrinsically disordered protein using protein nmr.
