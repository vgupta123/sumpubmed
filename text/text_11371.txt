BACKGROUND
the volvocine green algae, a group of ~ <dig> species involving the families chlamydomonaceae, goniaceae and volvocaceae  <cit> , serve as a model lineage for research into cellular differentiation, morphogenesis, epithelial folding and evolution of multicellularity  <cit> . furthermore, this group is used to study the evolution of sexual reproduction, including the evolution of anisogamy  <cit> . in many lineages, like higher plants and animals, the evolution of multicellularity and sexual reproduction occurred way back in evolutionary history and the molecular origins therefore are obscured by genetic drift. in the volvocine algae the development from unicellular species, which were similar to the present species chlamydomonas reinhardtii <cit> , to multicellular species and its relatives occurred only about  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . well-known multicellular species in this group are volvox, pleodorina, eudorina, pandorina and gonium <cit> . the 8– <dig> celled pandorina morum   <cit>  is intermediate in organizational complexity between the unicellular alga c. reinhardtii and the multicellular alga volvox carteri  and it has not been subject to molecular analyses and genetic engineering due to a lack of biotechnological possibilities.

the cells of p. morum form an ellipsoid spheroid with a distinct anterior-posterior polarity. the way of vegetative reproduction and mode of daughter colony formation where the young colonies break out of the old parental layers reminded bory of the legend of pandora’s box; thus, he applied the french diminutive, pandorina, to the genus he named  <cit> . there are several distinctive features of pandorina that warrant its inclusion in the series of volvocine algae to be analyzed molecularly in the future. pandorina has a special morphology among the volvocine algae: the cells fill nearly the entire volume of the colony, as opposed to other, larger volvocine algae in which the cells are arranged at the periphery of the colony, with extracellular matrix filling the space between cells. the compact morphology characteristic of pandorina  appears to be derived from ancestors with expanded ecm  <cit> . furthermore, pandorina is the smallest volvocine alga to exhibit a ‘colonial boundary’, the tripartite boundary that surrounds the entire colony. this ‘colonial boundary’ is the most conserved morphological feature of the volvocalean extracellular matrix  <cit> . pandorina is moreover the largest and most complex organism in the volvocine lineage that still exhibits isogamous sexual reproduction  <cit> . thus, the gametes of p. morum are almost identical in morphology, differing genetically only in allele expression in the mating-type locus   <cit> . the molecular-biological investigation and the comparison of molecular characteristics between the isogamous sexual reproduction in p. morum and anisogamous species like eudorina could reveal insights into the evolution of anisogamy, but such studies are hampered by the absence of methods for genetic engineering of p. morum. in contrast, the anisogamous species eudorina is accessible for genetic manipulations  <cit> . the technical feasibility of genetically manipulating a species of interest is a key factor for any detailed molecular analysis of gene or protein functions.

the nuclear genome of p. morum has not been sequenced, only its mitochondrial genome has been revealed  <cit> . actually, only the genomes of c. reinhardtii <cit>  and v. carteri <cit>  have been sequenced in the group of volvocine algae. for both species effective transformation protocols exist and they are accessible to molecular manipulations  <cit> . nuclear transformation protocols also exist for the volvocine algae gonium pectorale <cit>  and eudorina elegans <cit> . there is a single transformation technique that worked in all of the previously transformed volvocine species, namely particle bombardment.

aside from the nuclear transformation protocol, selectable markers and reporter genes are required for genetic manipulations. in the volvocine algae, selectable markers and reporter genes have mainly been established for c. reinhardtii <cit>  and, to a lesser extent, for v. carteri <cit> , g. pectorale <cit>  and e. elegans <cit> . in the present study, we wanted to check whether the vectors and transformation methods that were developed earlier for volvocine algae — in particular those for g. pectorale <cit>  and e. elegans <cit>  — can be applied with equal success to pandorina.

the most promising candidate for a selectable marker gene in pandorina was the aphviii gene of streptomyces rimosus that has been used as a selectable marker in c. reinhardtii <cit> , v. carteri <cit> , g. pectorale <cit>  and e. elegans <cit> . the aphviii gene codes for an aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate of atp to the 3′-position of an aminoglycoside antibiotic like paromomycin; this transfer chemically modifies and inactivates the antibiotic molecule. paromomycin otherwise inhibits cell growth by blocking the protein synthesis of ribosomes at the translocation stage  <cit> .

the best candidate for a useful reporter gene in p. morum seemed to be the luciferase gene  of the deep sea copepod gaussia princeps <cit> , which was previously adapted to the nuclear codon usage of c. reinhardtii <cit> . the gluc protein catalyzes the oxidation of the substrate coelenterazine into the excited form of coelenteramide that releases a photon with a wavelength of 480 nm upon electron transition to the ground state  <cit> . the blue light produced by this reaction can be detected by various methods like luminometer measurements and assays on light sensitive films  <cit> . the gluc reporter gene has successfully been introduced into c. reinhardtii <cit> , g. pectorale <cit>  and e. elegans <cit>  and it was functionally expressed in all three organisms.

the selectable markers and reporter genes also require appropriate promoters. based on previous results, promising candidates were the c. reinhardtii promoter of the abundant protein of photosystem i complex gene   <cit> , the c. reinhardtii promoter of the heat shock protein 70a   <cit> , and the v. carteri tandem promoter of the hsp70a and rbcs <dig> genes  <cit> . the c. reinhardtii hsp70a promoter and the v. carteri hsp70a/rbcs <dig> tandem promoter have already proved useful for expression of the aphviii gene in v. carteri, c. reinhardtii, g. pectorale and e. elegans <cit> .

here we demonstrate the stable nuclear transformation of p. morum using chimeric constructs containing heterologous aphviii and gluc genes under the control of heterologous 5′ and 3′ flanking sequences from v. carteri and c. reinhardtii. the enzyme activity of the heterologously expressed gaussia luciferase was detectable by luminometer measurements and bioluminescence assays. the expression of the heterologous gluc gene was further increased in transformants containing the gluc gene under control of the heterologous tandem promoter including the heat shock promoter, if the transformants were subject to a temporary shift to higher temperatures.

RESULTS
antibiotic tolerance of wild-type pandorina algae
to allow for selection of transformants with even weak transgene-mediated resistance, the lowest concentration of the antibiotic paromomycin that kills all wild-type pandorina cells was determined. to achieve this, a series of aliquots with the same number of wild-type p. morum cells was exposed to increasing concentrations of paromomycin, incubated for 10 days, and screened for living  or dead  cells. the alga p. morum tolerated concentrations of up to  <dig>  μg/ml paromomycin. a concentration of  <dig>  μg paromomycin/ml or higher led to 100% cell death . to allow for an objective and rapid discrimination between aliquots containing living cells and aliquots containing dead cells even in large-scale screenings of culture plates, red-shifted false-color images were created from standard photographs of the plates . red-shifting makes living cells much easier to distinguish from dead cells.

transformation experiments using aphviii as a selectable marker
the establishment and optimization of the transformation protocol was done by changing several parameters systematically . in the most successful protocol, 150 ml of a logarithmically growing p. morum culture with a density of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml was harvested by centrifugation. the concentrated algae were spread and immobilized on a cellulose acetate membrane filter and subjected to particle bombardment. the total number of cells used for each transformation experiment was about  <dig> ×  <dig>  different settings of the biolistic pds-1000/he  particle delivery system were tested to obtain the maximum number of paromomycin resistant transformants . the most effective protocol for the biolistic transformation of p. morum using dna-coated gold microprojectiles is described in the materials and methods section. the parameters for the most effective transformation protocol are summarized in table  <dig> 
p. morum 
transformation using a pds-1000/he biolistic device

for all transformation experiments, a chimeric, aphviii-based plasmid   <cit>  was used as a selectable marker that confers resistance to paromomycin. the ppmr <dig> plasmid contains the coding sequence of the streptomyces rimosus aphviii gene, a 5′-flanking sequence that includes an artificial tandem promoter from the hsp70a and rbcs <dig> genes of v. carteri, and a 3′-flanking sequence derived from the rbcs <dig> gene of v. carteri   <cit> .

unselectable plasmids were co-transformed with the selectable marker plasmid ppmr <dig>  for use as a reporter gene, the gluc gene was brought under control of different heterologous 5′ and 3′ flanking sequences from v. carteri and c. reinhardtii. the utilized plasmids were ppsad-gluc, phsp70a-gluc or phrlucp   <cit> . after the transformation procedure, the algae were incubated in liquid medium and allowed to recover for 24 h before paromomycin was added. within 48 h all non-transformed algae died, which resulted in a temporary clarification of the medium. after 10– <dig> days of incubation, re-greening of the incubation flasks indicated the initial presence and reproduction of at least one paromomycin-resistant transformant per flask. using this protocol, a total of  <dig> paromomycin resistant clones were obtained in  <dig> independent transformation experiments.

paromomycin resistance of transformants
the antibiotic resistance of the  <dig> transformants was justified and concretized by incubation for 10 days in 1 ml jm medium with different concentrations of paromomycin ranging from  <dig>  to 100 μg/ml . transformants with the most robust resistance tolerated concentrations up to 50 μg/ml paromomycin . thus, transformants of p. morum generated with the selectable marker plasmid ppmr <dig> exhibit an up to 333-fold higher tolerance to paromomycin than the wild-type strains. the variation in resistance between different clones is quite common in transformation experiments  <cit> . this could be the result of gene-dosage effects caused by variable number of copies integrated into the genome and/or it can reflect position effects on expression of the transgene due to its random integration into the genome.

stable genomic integration and expression of the artificial aphviii gene
pcr was used to verify the stable integration of the ppmr <dig> vector with the artificial aphviii gene into the genome of p. morum transformants. the artificial aphviii gene was driven by the v. carteri hsp70a/rbcs <dig> tandem promoter and it confers resistance to paromomycin. genomic dna was isolated from the  <dig> transformants about  <dig> generations after the transformants had been generated. the isolated dna was used as a template for pcr and a 324 bp chimeric fragment of genomic dna, containing 107 bp of the rbcs <dig> promoter region and 217 bp of the aphviii coding region, was expected to be amplified with the corresponding specific primers. pcr fragments of the expected size were obtained from many clones ; the fragments were cloned and sequenced . in figures 4b and 4c the lanes for the transformants panhr- <dig>  panhr- <dig>  panhsp- <dig>  panhsp- <dig>  panhsp- <dig> and panhsp- <dig> show no or only weak bands, which might reflect disturbance of the pcr reaction caused by too small dna amounts, impurities of the genomic dna or other reasons. anyway, the repetition of the pcrs with fresh dna isolates from these six clones yielded fragments of the expected size . moreover, growth of all  <dig> transformants in the presence of antibiotic already demonstrated the functional expression of the aphviii gene .

in addition to the provided indirect evidence of aphviii expression through the mediated antibiotic resistance in transformants, the transcription of the aphviii gene was also examined directly by rt-pcr analysis. for it, rna from paromomycin-resistant transformants was reverse transcribed, and products were amplified by pcr using aphviii specific primers. a cdna fragment with 324 bp was expected. actually, a pcr fragment of the expected size was obtained from all investigated paromomycin-resistant transformants, but not from the wild-type . the amplified fragments were cloned and sequenced .

calculation of transformation frequency
the transformation frequency was calculated as the ratio of transformants that exhibited both resistance against paromomycin and the correct aphviii fragment following pcr and the total number of cells used for each transformation experiment . based on the results of  <dig> independent transformation experiments, a transformation frequency of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per cell was calculated. this corresponds to a transformation frequency of about  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per organism.

plasmids for co-transformation with non-selectable reporter gene constructs
to investigate the efficiency of co-transformation in p. morum, three different plasmids were used containing the gluc gene of g. princeps, which was previously engineered to match the codon usage of c. reinhardtii <cit> .

plasmid ppsad-gluc contains the gluc gene under control of 5′ and 3′ control elements of the psad gene of c. reinhardtii <cit>  . in three volvocine species, i.e., c. reinhardtii, g. pectorale and e. elegans, the psad promoter was shown to mediate strong expression  <cit> .

plasmid phsp70a-gluc  <cit>   contains the gluc gene flanked by the c. reinhardtii hsp70a 5′utr and the rbcs <dig> 3′utr of c. reinhardtii. the hsp70a promoter was shown to mediate not only strong but also heat-inducible expression. the plasmid also contains the first three exons and two introns of the c. reinhardtii hsp70b gene that codes for the chloroplast transit peptide of the hsp70b protein  <cit> .

except for flanking sequences of c. reinhardtii, we also tested flanking sequences of v. carteri. plasmid phrlucp contains the coding region of the gluc gene fused to a v. carteri hsp70a/rbcs <dig> tandem promoter and a c. reinhardtii psad 3′utr . like in plasmid phsp70a-gluc, the tandem promoter should mediate not only strong but also heat-inducible expression.

stable integration of non-selectable reporter gene constructs into the genome
transformants were generated by co-transformation with the selectable ppmr <dig> plasmid and one of the three gluc-derived, non-selectable reporter gene plasmids at a time. the obtained transformants were screened for stable integration of the reporter gene constructs by pcr. for it, a pcr reaction was performed using genomic dna of transformants as a template and gluc-specific oligonucleotides. the expected fragment was 342 bp in size. such a fragment was obtained from transformants produced by co-transformation with the plasmids ppsad-gluc , phrlucp  and phsp70a-gluc  . as expected, pcrs with genomic dna of the wild-type yielded no such product. the identity of the amplified fragments was verified by cloning and sequencing . based on the results of the pcr experiments, the co-transformation rate in p. morum was determined to be 84% . the co-transformation rate was defined as the rate of transformants containing the gluc gene among the transformants containing the aphviii gene.

functional expression of co-transformed reporter genes
transformants generated by co-transformation with the selectable marker plasmid ppmr <dig> and the gluc-derived plasmids ppsad-gluc, phrlucp and phsp70a-gluc were assayed for functional expression of luciferase. for it, cell extracts of all transformants were checked for luciferase activity using a luminometer .for some reason, no significant luciferase activity was observed in transformants generated with ppsad-gluc . the relative light units  detected in these transformants are about the same as in wild-type cells and correspond to the background light, which is at about  <dig>  rlu.

in contrast, luciferase activity was detected in several transformants generated by co-transformation with the plasmid phrlucp . in this dna construct the gluc gene is under control of the artificial tandem promoter from the hsp70a and rbcs <dig> genes of v. carteri. extracts of ten out of sixteen transformants clearly showed emission of light and, thus, functional expression of luciferase. the amount of detected relative light units  is significantly higher than in the wild-type strain . the transformants panhr- <dig> and panhr- <dig> exhibited the highest gluc activity with  <dig>  ±  <dig>  rlu and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  rlu, respectively.

extracts of transformants generated by co-transformation with the plasmid phsp70a-gluc showed a significant but mostly moderate luciferase activity when cultivated under standard conditions at 29°c . in this dna construct the gluc gene is under the control of the c. reinhardtii hsp70a promoter; there is also the genomic sequence of the c. reinhardtii hsp70b chloroplast transit peptide containing two introns that precedes the gluc coding sequence. only transformant panhsp- <dig> exhibited a high gluc activity of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  rlu under these conditions, while the wild-type strain showed only 966 ±  <dig> rlu.

the dna constructs in phrlucp and phsp70a-gluc are driven by heat-shock promoters that show inducibility by heat in their donor organisms v. carteri and c. reinhardtii, respectively.

analysis for inducibility of these promoter elements in p. morum was done by subjecting the algae transformed with the plasmids phrlucp and phsp70a-gluc to a temperature shift. the temperature was changed from 29°c to  <dig> different temperatures between 27°c and 51°c. the strongest increase in luciferase activity was achieved by a temperature shift to 39°c for 1 h. in extracts of transformants generated by co-transformation with plasmid phrlucp the luciferase activity increased between 33- and 120-fold compared to algae that were kept at 29°c. extracts of transformants generated by co-transformation with plasmid phsp70a-gluc showed a 30- to 555-fold increase in luciferase activity .the heat-inducibility of luciferase activity also was investigated by an assay using light sensitive films and intact, undisrupted cells. for it, an aliquot of the transformant cells produced with plasmid phrlucp was subject to a temperature shift from 29°c to 39°c for 1 h; as a reference, another aliquot of the transformant cells was kept at 29°c. the aliquots were pipetted into separate wells of a 24-well microtiter plate, substrate solution was added and the plates were set down on a light sensitive film for 2 h in the dark. in heat-treated transformants, the light emission caused by luciferase activity was strong enough to turn the light sensitive film totally black . no signal was detectable in transformants that were not subject to the increase in temperature. as expected, both untreated and heat-treated wild-type cells also show no signal.

the molecular weight of the mature gluc protein in p. morum was determined by comparison with a molecular weight marker in an in-gel activity assay. for it, cell extracts of heat induced transformants and controls were separated on a standard sds-page without thiol reagents. after electrophoresis, sds was removed from the gel to allow for refolding of the luciferase enzyme into its active conformation. after addition of the substrate solution, the gel was set down on a light sensitive film for 2 h in the dark.in cell extracts from heat-treated transformants, generated by co-transformation with plasmid phrlucp , light emission produced a band with a size of about 20 kda that reflects the molecular weight of the gluc protein . for transformants generated by co-transformation with plasmid phsp70a-gluc, a size of 31 kda was calculated for the intact, unprocessed hsp70b/gluc fusion protein. the in-gel activity assay loaded with cell extracts from heat-treated transformants  shows a band of only about 20 kda. this size reveals that the hsp70b chloroplast transit peptide has been cleaved off as expected.

the results from the in-gel activity assays substantiate the heat-inducibility of heat-shock promoters from heterologous sources in p. morum.

long term stability of dna integration and gene expression
for any biotechnological approach with transgenic organisms, the stability of the transgenes is of fundamental importance. therefore, the stability and expression of the aphviii and gluc genes introduced into p. morum transformants was investigated after twelve months of cultivation or, in other words, after about  <dig> generations. cultivation was without selective pressure during the twelve months. the presence of the heterologous genes was rechecked by pcr and the functionality of the expression products was reexamined by paromomycin resistance assays and luminometer assays. in all transformants, pcr fragments of the expected sizes were amplified and, thus, the genomic integration of the artificial gene constructs could be confirmed by pcr. all transformants exhibited about the same antibiotic resistance compared to the values determined right after transformation; the range of fluctuations was only +/-6%. likewise, luciferase activity in the transformants was stable. the comparison of the values after twelve months of cultivation with the values determined right after transformation gave a fluctuation range of only +/-7%. thus, both integration and expression of the heterologous aphviii and gluc genes are stable in p. morum.

discussion
here we demonstrate the stable nuclear transformation of the green alga p. morum by particle bombardment with plasmid-coated gold particles. our approach only uses plasmids containing chimeric constructs from heterologous sources. particle bombardment also was efficient for transformation of c. reinhardtii <cit> , v. carteri <cit> , g. pectorale <cit>  and e. elegans <cit> . the capability for stable genetical modification of an organism of interest is an important requirement in modern molecular biology, because this technique facilitates the identification of gene functions and allows for the introduction of additional characteristics and abilities.

antibiotics resistance
for stable nuclear transformation of p. morum the aphviii gene of s. rimosus driven by a v. carteri hsp70a/rbcs <dig> tandem promoter proved to be a suitable selectable marker, even though all parts of the dna construct came from heterologous sources. transformants generated with the aphviii construct show an up to 333-fold higher tolerance to the aminoglycoside antibiotic paromomycin compared to the parent wild-type strain. when the aphviii gene was used as a selectable marker in other volvocine algae, the factor for the increase in antibiotic tolerance in transformants was similar or lower. for v. carteri the increase in antibiotic tolerance was about 100-fold  <cit> , it was  <dig> to  <dig> fold in c. reinhardtii <cit> , about 330-fold in e. elegans <cit>  and  <dig> to  <dig> fold in g. pectorale <cit> . even if the antibiotic tolerance of transformants varies between the investigated volvocine species, the aphviii gene allowed for selection of transformants in all these species.

transformation frequency
the frequency of transformation was calculated to be  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per cell in p. morum. the transformation frequency in v. carteri was estimated to be  <dig>  × 10- <dig> <cit> . in c. reinhardtii the frequency of transformation was  <dig>  -  <dig>  × 10- <dig> <cit> ; it was  <dig>  –  <dig>  × 10- <dig> in g. pectorale <cit>  and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> in e. elegans <cit> . thus, the transformation frequency in p. morum is about  <dig> times lower than in v. carteri but about  <dig> to  <dig> times higher than in c. reinhardtii, g. pectorale and e. elegans. on an overall basis, the transformation frequencies in volvocine algae vary by about two orders of magnitude . there is limited information about transformation frequencies in other algae with the exception of some diatom species. the reported frequencies are  <dig> × 10- <dig> -  <dig> × 10- <dig> per cell in phaeodactylum tricornutum <cit>  and  <dig> × 10- <dig> -  <dig> × 10- <dig> per cell in cyclotella cryptica and navicula saprophila <cit> . therefore, in diatoms the frequency of transformation is similar or somewhat lower compared to that in volvocine algae.

co-transformation rate
co-transformation of a selectable marker plasmid and the gene of interest on a separate plasmid is a common strategy especially when large genes and complex gene constructs have to be integrated into the genome  <cit> . another advantage of co-transformation is that the same selectable marker plasmid can be used for all transformation experiments. in p. morum the co-transformation rate was calculated to be at about 80%. for v. carteri co-transformation rates of 10% - 60%  <cit>  or 40% - 80%  <cit>  have been reported. the co-transformation rate was about 80% in c. reinhardtii <cit> , 30% - 50% in g. pectorale <cit>  and 50% - 100% in e. elegans <cit> . the co-transformation rates in volvocine algae are high in all volvocine species and particularly in p. morum. therefore, transformation of p. morum does not require construction of vectors that contain all required genes and regulatory elements on a single plasmid.

expression of heterologous genes using heterologous promoters
some promoters from c. reinhardtii have been shown to work in v. carteri and vice versa  <cit> . likewise, some promoter elements from c. reinhardtii and v. carteri also work in g. pectorale and e. elegans <cit> . here we show for p. morum that both the heterologous hsp70a/rbcs <dig> tandem promoter of v. carteri and the heterologous hsp70a promoter of c. reinhardtii work in this species. three out of the four constructs clearly lead to functional expression of the heterologous gluc luciferase and the heterologous aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase viii  enzymes. it is unclear why transformants produced with ppsad-gluc  didn’t produce significant luciferase activity.

the heterologous heat shock promoters retained their inducibility by heat when expressed in p. morum. the expression was up to  <dig> times higher in heat-shocked versus non-heat-shocked cultures.

CONCLUSIONS
the introduction of foreign genes into the nuclear genome of p. morum by particle bombardment is now feasible. both the heterologous hsp70a/rbcs <dig> tandem promoter of v. carteri and the heterologous hsp70a promoter of c. reinhardtii drive the expression of heterologous genes in p. morum. both promoters retained their heat-inducibility in p. morum. furthermore, the heterologous aphviii gene of s. rimosus was established as a selectable marker and the gluc luciferase gene was found to be a useful reporter gene in p. morum. it is thus to be emphasized that genetic engineering of a species is possible even without the availability of any endogenous genes and promoters.
