BACKGROUND
the genus paracoccus  currently comprises  <dig> recognized and validly named species, isolated from different environments in various geographical locations. members of this genus exhibit a broad range of metabolic flexibility, especially in respiratory processes, e.g. employing nitrate, nitrite, nitrous oxide and nitric oxide as alternative electron acceptors in denitrification and the ability to use one-carbon  compounds  as electron donors to respiratory chains  <cit> . moreover, paracoccus spp. as facultative chemolithoautotrophs may utilize reduced sulfur compounds , molecular hydrogen and fe as energy sources  <cit> . paracoccus spp. are also able to use a broad range of organic compounds as their sole source of carbon and energy, including pollutants such as acetone, dichloromethane, formamide, n,n-dimethylformamide  and methylamine  <cit> . another common feature of paracoccus spp. is methylotrophy, defined as the ability to utilize reduced c <dig> carbon substrates containing no carbon-carbon bonds  as their sole source of carbon and energy for growth.

having a versatile metabolism, paracoccus spp. play an important role in biogeochemical cycles and they have also been successfully employed in the biotreatment of contaminated environments, e.g. bioremediation of soils contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  using paracoccus sp. hpd- <dig>  <cit> .

although paracoccus spp. constitute an interesting and metabolically versatile group of bacteria with substantial biotechnological potential, little is known about the content and organization of their genomes. only one complete genome of paracoccus denitrificans pd <dig> has been deposited in the ncbi database . this genome is composed of two chromosomes  and a single megaplasmid  of 653 kb. four paracoccus spp. genome sequencing projects  are currently in progress.

much more is known about mobile genetic elements  of paracoccus spp. baj and colleagues   <cit>  demonstrated that bacteria belonging to this genus usually harbor at least one plasmid . several multireplicon strains carrying  <dig> or more plasmids were identified, including p. aminophilus jcm  <dig>  our group has already obtained the sequences of  <dig> plasmids, ranging in size from  <dig>  to 40 kb, that originate from different paracoccus spp.: p. methylutens dm <dig>   <cit> , p. pantotrophus dsm  <dig>   <cit>  and four carotenoid producers, p. aestuarii dsm  <dig>  , p. haeundaensis lmg p- <dig>  , p. marcusii dsm  <dig>   and p. marcusii os <dig>  . we have also sequenced the basic replicons of three other plasmids from p. alcaliphilus jcm  <dig>  and p. versutus uw <dig>   <cit> . moreover, complex analyses of  <dig> paracoccus spp. strains using trap plasmid systems have led to the identification and characterization of   <dig> insertion sequences ,  a composite transposon tn <dig> carrying genetic modules involved in the arginine deiminase pathway and daunorubicin/doxorubicin resistance,   <dig> non-composite transposons of the tn <dig> family,  a transposable genomic island tnppa <dig>  and  several transposable modules  generated by a single copy of the is <dig> family insertion sequence  <cit> . the findings outlined above suggest that horizontal gene transfer  events occur frequently in paracoccus spp. genomes, which may explain their metabolic flexibility.

among paracoccus species, p. aminophilus jcm  <dig> is of particular interest since it is a methylotrophic bacterium capable of utilizing several toxic c <dig> compounds, including n,n-dimethylformamide, formamide as well as tri-, di- and monomethylamine, which are widely used in the chemical industry  <cit> . p. aminophilus jcm  <dig> carries eight indigenous, extrachromosomal replicons  ranging in size from  <dig>  kb to approximately 440 kb. our previous analyses, focused on the three smallest plasmids, pami <dig> , pami <dig>  and pami <dig> , revealed the presence of  novel types of plasmid-encoded maintenance systems  <cit> ,  a type ii restriction-modification module with ncoi specificity  <cit>  and  genes crucial for the first step in the degradation of dmf  <cit> .

in the present study, the genome of p. aminophilus jcm  <dig> was completely sequenced and analyzed. an in-depth exploration of this genome sequence, followed by functional analyses, provided considerable insights into its overall architecture, as well as the functions of particular replicons. moreover, in this study, the first inducible paracoccus phage was identified.

RESULTS
sequencing and general features of the p. aminophilus jcm  <dig> genome
a 454-pyrosequencing run for the p. aminophilus jcm <dig> genomic dna yielded  <dig> shotgun and 8-kb-long paired-end reads with a total number of  <dig> ,536 bp that were assembled into  <dig> scaffolds. the scaffolds consisted of  <dig> large  and  <dig> small  contigs. the gaps in the chromosome and plasmids were closed by a pcr-based approach followed by sequencing of the corresponding amplicons. subsequently, the genome was re-sequenced  applying the illumina hiscansq genome analyzer.

the genome of p. aminophilus jcm  <dig> is composed of a single circular chromosome of  <dig> ,807 bp and eight circular plasmids: pami <dig> , pami <dig> , pami <dig> , pami <dig> , pami <dig> , pami <dig> , pami <dig>  and pami <dig>  . thus, the total size of the genome is  <dig> ,798 bp. the overall gc content of the chromosome is  <dig> %, which is consistent with other sequenced paracoccus genomes. the gc contents of the jcm  <dig> plasmids ranges between  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  .
p. aminophilus 
jcm  <dig> genome

the genome of jcm  <dig> possesses  <dig> trnas and four clusters of 5s, 16s and 23s rrna genes, which are located within the chromosome and plasmid pami <dig> . this strain can produce trnas for all  <dig> amino acids, and genes encoding all the aminoacyl-trna synthetases are present within its chromosome. moreover, a single trna for selenocyteine  was also identified.

the jcm  <dig> genome contains  <dig> putative coding sequences :  <dig> in the chromosome and  <dig> in the plasmids . the coding density within the chromosome is  <dig> %, while within the plasmids it varies from 72%  to  <dig> %  . we could assign putative biological functions to  <dig> cdss , while  <dig> cdss  were annotated as encoding hypothetical proteins of unknown function.

predicted p. aminophilus proteins were functionally categorized and the proportions in each cog category were calculated. a total of  <dig>  predicted proteins were described as involved in the overall cellular metabolism, being assigned to cog functional categories c, g, e, f, h, i or q. it appeared that more than 40% of the genes encoding proteins involved in metabolic processes are located within extrachromosomal elements, mainly pami <dig>  pami <dig>  pami <dig> and pami <dig> . this finding suggests that these four replicons perform an important role .

the most abundant class of proteins comprises those involved in amino acid transport and metabolism . a total of  <dig>  cdss were assigned to this category, of which  <dig> occur within the aforementioned replicons: pami <dig> , pami <dig> , pami <dig>  and pami <dig>  .

transcription regulatory network
within the jcm  <dig> genome, we identified  <dig> genes  encoding predicted sigma factors:  feci-like σ <dig> – required for the uptake of iron ,  rpoe-like σ <dig> – enabling the expression of genes involved in the heat shock response, as well as extracytoplasmic transport ,  rpoh-like σ <dig> – involved in the heat shock and other stress responses ,  rpon-like σ <dig> – involved in nitrogen metabolism  and  rpod-like σ <dig> – regulating gene expression during exponential growth . genes equivalent to rpof  and rpos , responsible for the expression of flagellar genes and genes in the stationary phase of growth, respectively, were not detected in this genome. in addition, we identified anti-sigma  and anti-anti-sigma  factors within the jcm  <dig> chromosome.

the presence of eleven alternative sigma factors , enables global changes in gene expression and permits alteration of the overall cellular metabolism in response to changing environmental conditions  <cit> . thus, this feature indirectly reflects the metabolic flexibility and adaptive abilities of the strain jcm  <dig>  it is noteworthy that three of five p. aminophilus feci  genes were identified within plasmids, which suggests an important role for these replicons in iron transport and metabolism. moreover, the only rpon gene copy was carried by a plasmid, pami <dig>  it was previously demonstrated that rpon, besides regulating genes involved in nitrogen metabolism, enables the transcription of a wide range of other genes encoding proteins participating in the regulation of virulence-related factors, as well as in amino acid, carbohydrate and organic acid synthesis, utilization and transport  <cit> . this indicates that pami <dig> may be highly significant in overall gene regulation in the strain jcm  <dig> 

global regulators, which have the ability to regulate operons that belong to various metabolic pathways, are another basic component of transcription regulatory networks in bacteria. it has been shown that the expression of 51% of the e. coli genes is under the control of only seven regulatory proteins: crp, fnr, ihf, fis, arca, narl and lrp  <cit> . within the jcm  <dig> genome we identified genes encoding  <dig> types of putative global gene regulators:  three crp/fnr family transcriptional regulators ,  three fis family transcriptional regulators ,  a h-ns proteins ,  a lrp regulator  and  integration host factor  subunits a  and b .

we also identified  <dig> genes encoding transcriptional regulators with predicted local specificity of action, probably limited to a single gene/gene cluster . a quarter of the identified regulators were assigned to the lysr family – the most abundant type of transcriptional regulators in bacteria  <cit> . interestingly, we identified genes encoding  <dig> regulators of the luxr family, which are located within the chromosome and plasmids pami <dig>  pami <dig>  pami <dig> and pami <dig>  the majority of luxr-type proteins represents transcription activators, which specifically bind to n-acyl homoserine lactones  that are secreted signaling molecules involved in quorum sensing in a variety of gram-negative bacteria . we also identified cdss for  <dig> putative n-acyl-l-homoserine lactone synthetases : two localized within the chromosome  and one in plasmid pami <dig> . the presence of luxr and luxi genes strongly suggests that quorum sensing plays a role in regulation of p. aminophilus gene expression.

two-component systems are another important part of bacterial transcription regulatory networks present in p. aminophilus. such systems are directly involved in sensing a cell’s external environment and signal transduction . within the jcm  <dig> genome we identified  <dig> pairs of genes encoding histidine protein kinases  and phospho-aspartyl response regulators:  <dig> of them within the chromosome and others located on plasmids pami <dig>  pami <dig>  pami <dig> and pami <dig> . moreover, we identified  <dig> hpks with unknown partner response regulators in the chromosome and pami <dig> .

among the p. aminophilus hpks we found homologs of enzymes of well-described two-component phosphorelay systems involved in regulating  nitrogen assimilation – ntrb   <cit> ,  chemotaxis – chea   <cit> ,  phosphate homeostasis – phor   <cit> ,  differentiation and cell cycle progression – ccka   <cit> ,  c4-dicarboxylate metabolism – dctb   <cit> ,  expression of virulence factors – qsec   <cit> ,  methanol and formaldehyde oxidation – flhs ,  several anaerobic processes and assimilation of co <dig> and n <dig> – regb   <cit> ,  high affinity potassium-uptake – kdpd   <cit>  and  expression of the tor structural operon encoding the trimethylamine n-oxide reductase respiratory system in response to substrate availability – tors   <cit> .

stress response
in the majority of cases, the processes underlying the global stress response of bacteria are dependent on alterations in gene expression, usually controlled at the transcriptional level by various sigma factors  <cit> . however, there are also several more specific stress response mechanisms.

a fundamental trigger of the cellular stress response is dna damage. in this scenario, the bacterial defense mechanism relies on a conserved inducible pathway – the sos response . the primary components of this pathway, reca recombinase and the lexa repressor, are encoded within the jcm  <dig> chromosome .

moreover, the spot/rela, ppgpp synthetase i , involved in the bacterial stringent response  was also identified. during the stringent response process, an accumulation of the signaling nucleotides pppgpp and ppgpp occurs, which causes dramatic alterations in gene expression  <cit> . an important role in this process is also played by the chromosomally-encoded rele toxin of the relbe systems, which, as mrna-cleaving enzymes, globally inhibits translation during amino acid starvation  <cit> . within the p. aminophilus genome we identified  <dig> toxin-antitoxin  pairs representing the families relbe/parde , phd-doc , ccdab , hipab , and  <dig> hybrid systems . the majority of the identified ta modules were localized within the plasmids , and they most probably perform replicon stabilization functions. only a single ta system of the hipab family was located on the chromosome.

among the most important factors in the maintenance of cellular fitness under changing environmental conditions are molecular chaperones. they are involved in various processes in bacterial cells, such as assisting the folding of newly synthesized proteins, protein secretion, preventing the aggregation of proteins under heat shock conditions, and repairing proteins that have been damaged or misfolded due to stress conditions . within the p. aminophilus genome we identified  <dig> putative molecular chaperones, the majority of which  are encoded by the chromosome. these include heat and cold shock proteins, proteases, disulfide bond chaperones and protein-export chaperones . we also identified a major rna chaperone, hfq, which is a key player in small rna -mediated regulation of target mrnas, that promotes srna-mrna base pairing to permit rapid adaptive responses  <cit> . surprisingly, we did not identify homologs of the bacterial htpg  protein, which is responsible for heat or chemical shock responses. this is unusual because genes encoding htpg proteins are present in the majority of bacterial genomes  <cit> .

dna recombination and repair
since the integrity of the genomic dna is fundamental to bacterial persistence, it is extremely important that the cell is equipped with sufficient dna repair proteins to protect it against genetic damage  <cit> . within the jcm  <dig> genome we identified  <dig> genes encoding proteins predicted to be involved in various dna repair pathways. the vast majority of them  are located within the chromosome. we performed a detailed characterization and classification of all genes encoding dna repair-related proteins . comparison of the dna repair genes of p. aminophilus with those of two well defined species, escherichia coli  and caulobacter crescentus , revealed the presence of  <dig> and  <dig> orthologous genes, respectively .

as in c. crescentus <cit> , the jcm  <dig> genome contains no muth and dam homologs, which implies that both strains use different proteins to recognize and repair dna replication errors. p. aminophilus, like many other alphaproteobacteria  also lacks the recbcd module, but possesses the related system addab instead, which recognizes a 5-base chi site   <cit> . curiously, we also found that p. aminophilus does not encode a typical deoxyribodipyrimidine photolyase . these enzymes employ visible light as the energy source to monomerize pyrimidine dimers induced by uv irradiation  <cit> , and orthologs are found within the c. crescentus genome. instead of phr, jcm  <dig> encodes a non-related splb-like dna repair photolyase. it was shown that the splb protein is a dna repair enzyme responsible for the process of reversion of the thymine dimer, 5-thyminyl- <dig> -dihydrothymine , formed during uv irradiation of bacillus subtilis spores  <cit> . we hypothesize that this protein may function as the major photolyase of p. aminophilus, responsible for the photo-reactivation process.

although the majority of the dna repair proteins are found within the jcm  <dig> chromosome,  <dig> genes encoding such proteins are present in three plasmids: pami <dig> , pami <dig>  and pami <dig> . among them is an alkb gene , which encodes a highly conserved and usually chromosomally-encoded protein , responsible for the repair of alkylation damage in dna via an oxidative demethylation pathway  <cit> . the presence of this alkb gene within pami <dig> suggests that it may be an essential replicon.

dna methylation
genes encoding predicted dna methyltransferases , which may play important roles in the regulation of replication, gene expression and mismatch repair systems  were detected in the jcm  <dig> genome. in addition to the previously described m.pami  <cit> , that is part of the type ii restriction-modification system encoded by plasmid pami <dig>  we identified seven chromosomally-encoded putative mtase genes. all of them seem to be orphan mtases, since they lack associated partner endonucleases.

the gene jcm7685_ <dig> encodes a ccrm  homolog. its ability to modify adenine residues in gantc sequences was confirmed in vivo and in vitro . the ccrm methyltransferases were shown to be essential for the viability of various alphaproteobacteria  and to play a crucial role in the regulation of bacterial cell division . to confirm the pivotal role of the jcm7686_ <dig> gene product in the p. aminophilus cell cycle, we attempted to disrupt this gene. however, this proved to be impossible, unless a wild-type copy was provided in trans, demonstrating that this ccrm homolog is essential for the viability of the host strain.

the other six genes encoding putative mtases are located within predicted prophage regions. based on automatic methyltransferase prediction algorithms we allocated the following genes to different mtase classes: m6a mtases – jcm7686_ <dig>  jcm7686_ <dig> and jcm7686_2934; m4c mtase – jcm7686_0815; m5c mtases – jcm7686_ <dig> and jcm7686_ <dig>  each of these predicted methylase genes was cloned into an expression vector and expressed in e. coli. the activity of the recombinant mtases was assessed and their sequence specificity determined using the endonuclease protection assay  .

this analysis revealed that both m5c mtases have relaxed substrate specificity , but they do not protect dna against cleavage by r.pami, encoded by the restriction-modification system of pami <dig>  the m4c mtase of jcm  <dig> recognizes and methylates yggccr sequences . the three m6a mtases are highly similar  and they methylate the sequence gantc . this is the same sequence specificity as assigned to the ccrm methylase .

multireplicon structure of the jcm  <dig> genome
as mentioned above, the genome of p. aminophilus jcm  <dig> is composed of a single chromosome and eight smaller replicons  . predicted plasmids constitute  <dig> % of the genome and they carry  <dig> cdss , which means that a huge amount of genetic information is stored within these replicons. among the jcm  <dig> plasmids we distinguished  <dig> mega-sized replicons , pami <dig>  pami <dig>  pami <dig>  pami <dig> and pami <dig>  all carrying genes conserved in bacterial chromosomes, including chromosomes i and ii of p. denitrificans pd <dig> . since size is not an infallible criterion for distinguishing plasmids from secondary chromosomes, functional analyses of the jcm  <dig> replicons was undertaken.

to characterize the function of the mega-sized replicons in the cellular metabolism we constructed mini-derivatives, which were used to remove the native plasmids from the host cell by incompatibility , into the e. coli-specific, mobilizable, narrow-host-range vector pabw <dig>   <cit> . using the obtained mini-derivatives containing incompatibility determinants, we were able to remove plasmids pami <dig>  pami <dig>  pami <dig> and pami <dig> from jcm  <dig> . interestingly, curing this strain of pami <dig> resulted in a change in colony morphology, which became irregular, flat and dry. we were unable to introduce the mini-derivative of pami <dig> into jcm  <dig> cells. it was therefore impossible to remove pami <dig>  which strongly suggests that this replicon might be essential to host viability.

growth rate analysis of strains deprived of the individual megaplasmids was performed in rich lb medium, as well as in ac minimal salt medium. this revealed that the removal of plasmids pami <dig>  pami <dig> and pami <dig> had no effect on the growth rate . interestingly, the pami1-less derivative grew in the form of irregular flocks , which were in fact the aggregations of bacterial cells. in the case of the pami6-less strain, growth in lb medium was significantly decreased, and it was completely inhibited in ac medium . this indicates that the presence of plasmid pami <dig> enables growth of this p. aminophilus strain in minimal medium.

based on the obtained results we have classified the pami-replicons into two groups:  essential  and  non-essential  genetic elements.

additionally, to extend the functional analyses, the host ranges of pami1-pami <dig> replicons were examined using their plasmid mini-derivatives cloned within plasmid pabw <dig>  the tested strains of alphaproteobacteria were classified into two orders:  rhodobacterales, represented by paracoccus versutus uw <dig> and paracoccus pantotrophus kl <dig>  and  rhizobiales, represented by the families brucellaceae  and rhizobiaceae, including members of the rhizobium/agrobacterium group  and the sinorhizobium/ensifer group . replication abilities of pami1-pami <dig> were also tested in alcaligenes sp. lm16r  and e. coli br <dig> .

this analysis revealed that mini-derivatives of pami <dig>  pami <dig>  pami <dig>  pami <dig>  pami <dig> and pami <dig> could replicate in all analyzed strains of alphaproteobacteria, while the introduction of pami <dig> and pami <dig> into sinorhizobium sp. and ochrobactrum sp. was impossible, which may be due to strong incompatibility with their native replicons. we were also unable to introduce any of the analyzed plasmids into representatives of the beta- or gammaproteobacteria . these findings indicate the relatively narrow host range of the analyzed replicons, being limited to members of the alphaproteobacteria class.

essential genetic elements – chromids
the curing experiments showed that the pami <dig> replicon could not be removed from jcm  <dig> cells. close inspection of the genetic content of this plasmid revealed that  <dig>  of its genes are conserved in the chromosomes of p. denitrificans pd <dig> , and that  <dig> of them are singletons in the jcm  <dig> genome. these genes encode several proteins of unknown function, but also proteins that are probably involved in the host metabolism, including  iron transport,  d-pantothenate synthesis,  motility,  folate one-carbon metabolism and  de novo nad biosynthesis. interestingly, the nadabc  genes are the only ones encoding components of the de novo nad biosynthetic pathway  identified within the jcm  <dig> genome, which may explain the essential nature of the pami <dig> replicon. it is important to mention that the loss of nadabc genes most probably cannot be compensated via the nad salvage pathway, since the predicted nad pyrophosphatase  is also encoded by pami <dig> replicon  . moreover, pami <dig> contains the only copies of  the alkb gene  induced during adaptive responses and involved in the direct reversal of alkylation damage  <cit>  and  the hslj gene  encoding a heat shock protein  <cit> .

all the aforementioned genes may play an important role in the jcm  <dig> metabolism and we speculate that some of them may be responsible for the pami <dig> essentiality. however this needs to be experimentally confirmed.

essential element status can also be assigned to the pami <dig> replicon. although, we were able to remove it from jcm  <dig> cells cultivated in lb medium, the growth of the pami6-less strain was completely inhibited in minimal salt medium . analysis of the genetic content of pami <dig> revealed the presence of several modules that are typically encoded on chromosomes. corresponding genes are involved in histidine, folate, glycerophospholipid, purine, selenoamino acid, sulfur, propanoate, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism. a surprising finding was the amtb gene , which encodes a nh4+ transporter of the amt/rh family  <cit> . presence of this gene on pami <dig> may explain why this plasmid is essential for growth in minimal salt medium, where the only nitrogen source is nh4cl, which cannot be transported into the cell in the absence of an appropriate transporter. this finding was confirmed by the analysis of the strain growth in minimal medium with casamino acids as a nitrogen source instead of ammonium chloride. pami6-less strain was able to growth in such medium, but its growth rate was significantly decreased. this suggests that there are also some additional  genes, which are responsible for the essentiality of this replicon.

a growing number of studies in the field of genomics have produced data suggesting that the structure of many bacterial genomes is more complex than previously assumed. many bacteria bear additional, large, autonomous replicons, which  carry a pool of housekeeping genes  <cit> . unlike typical plasmids, such replicons are necessary for the viability of their hosts, and for this reason they were initially defined as “secondary chromosomes”. however, this name is inadequate since these replicons possess many characteristics typical of plasmids: they contain plasmid-like replication systems and other genetic modules of plasmid origin. bioinformatic analyses of these replicon sequences indicated that they were generated by the transfer of genetic information from chromosomes to plasmids co-residing in the cell. due to their dualistic properties, they have been reclassified into a separate, newly distinguished group with properties of both chromosomes and plasmids: the chromids  <cit> . our analyses indicate that pami <dig> and pami <dig> can be classified into this group of elements as well.

non-essential genetic elements – plasmids
six of the predicted jcm  <dig> plasmids  were readily removed from the host cells. among these dispensable replicons are the two repabc-type megaplasmids, pami <dig> and pami <dig> . interestingly, pami <dig> and pami <dig> carry almost as many putative transposase genes  as the whole chromosome , and many more than the other replicons  . within pami <dig> and pami <dig> we identified  <dig> genes encoding predicted transporters involved in the transport of  amino acids/dipeptides ,  sn-glycerol-3-phosphate ,  taurine  and  inorganic ions . genes encoding predicted transporters constitute  <dig> and 10% of the genetic information carried by plasmids pami <dig> and pami <dig>  respectively. moreover, within pami <dig> we identified a vir-gene cluster of a type iv secretion system, which is frequently found in alphaproteobacteria megaplasmids  <cit> , and  <dig> putative dsb-like genes the products of which may be involved in introducing disulfide bonds into diverse substrate proteins  <cit> .

as mentioned above, the removal of pami <dig> from jcm  <dig> cells influenced colony morphology and affected the growth mode in rich lb medium  . analysis of the pami <dig> sequence revealed that 40% of its genes encode proteins involved in amino acid transport and metabolism. since amino acids serve as the main nitrogen source in lb medium, while nitrogen is provided by ammonium ions in ac medium, this may explain the observed growth differences.

prophages and other prophage-related regions
in the p. aminophilus chromosome, we identified  <dig> regions encoding phage-related proteins . these constitute  <dig> % of the host chromosome. close inspection revealed that only  <dig> of them encode a full set of proteins crucial for the phage “life cycle”. thus only these regions were considered to represent putative prophages and designated ϕpam- <dig> to ϕpam- <dig>  respectively . the predicted sizes of the identified prophages range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb and they comprise between  <dig> and  <dig> phage-related genes coding for proteins involved in integration, replication, packaging, capsid and tail assembly, and lysis. for four of the prophages we could identify putative integration sites, which were trna sequences .

the vast majority of genes annotated within the prophage regions encode hypothetical proteins of unknown function. however, since prophages may encode fitness factors  for their lysogenic hosts  we performed in-depth homology searches and found that genes jcm7686_ <dig> and jcm7686_ <dig>  encode tellurite resistance proteins . moreover, we found that all but one  of the prophages encode methyltransferases .

the jcm  <dig> prophages exhibit high reciprocal nucleotide sequence similarity , but they share only limited and localized homology with other prophages. this finding suggests their uniqueness among so far identified bacteriophages. comparative analyses of the phage structural proteins revealed that five of the jcm  <dig> prophages  encode major capsid proteins similar to those of hk97-like phages , which may suggest some evolutionary relationship.

to identify functional phages we applied the method of aggressive induction with mitomycin c. using this procedure, only one of the jcm  <dig> prophages, ϕpam- <dig>  was induced. the ϕpam- <dig> prophage is flanked in the genome by 17-bp direct repeats  which were recognized as the phage attachment site. in addition, ϕpam- <dig> encodes a serine family recombinase, rather than a tyrosine family integrase that is typical for phages . following induction, bacteriophage particles were visualized by transmission electron microscopy using negative staining with uranyl acetate  and it was confirmed by the restriction analysis that they contain ϕpam- <dig> dna. hence, ϕpam- <dig> is the first functional phage identified in paracoccus spp.

among the predicted prophage-related regions we also identified one gene transfer agent  cluster of  <dig>  kb, which contains  <dig> putative genes . this gta cluster is located upstream of the cyse gene, encoding serine o-acetyltransferase , which is a common location for gtas in bacterial genomes  <cit> . the identified region shares synteny and exhibits 80% nucleotide sequence identity with a gta cluster found within chromosome ii of paracoccus denitrificans pd <dig> . moreover, the p. aminophilus gta exhibits homology to other rcgta-like gene clusters  identified in various representatives of alphaproteobacteria <cit> .

transposable elements 
analysis of the jcm  <dig> genome identified  <dig> predicted transposase genes ; however,  <dig> of them are truncated . the encoded transposases were classified and particular tes distinguished .

we identified  <dig> types of complete insertion sequences representing  <dig> is families  . most of the identified iss are present as a single copy in the jcm  <dig> genome. the exceptions are ispam <dig> and ispam <dig> , as well as ispam <dig> . as shown in figure 3c, the majority of the identified iss contain a single orf encoding a transposase  or carry two overlapping orfs and possess a conserved frame-shift motif . the frame-shift sequences are most probably responsible for the generation of a fusion protein  as a result of programmed translational frame-shifting  <cit> . a putative trans-frame transposase may also be potentially produced by ispam <dig> of the is <dig> family. ispam <dig> also contains two additional orfs , which may be involved in the regulation of transposition.

within the plasmid component of the jcm  <dig> genome we also identified a non-composite, cryptic transposon tn3434a of the tn <dig> family. it is present in  <dig> copies: in pami <dig>  pami <dig> and pami <dig> . the presence of two identical divergently oriented copies of tn3434a within pami <dig> resulted in inversion of an approx. 15-kb dna region due to site-specific resolvase-mediated recombination.

in a previous study, using a trap plasmid strategy, we showed that ispam <dig>  ispam <dig>  ispam <dig> and tn3434a are fully functional elements  <cit> . however, such analyses have some limitations because, although it may identify most active elements, other functional tes can be missed due to their low transposition frequency.

comparative genomics of paracoccus spp
until now, the annotated genome sequences of only four paracoccus spp. strains are available in public databases: p. denitrificans pd <dig> , paracoccus sp. strain trp  <cit> , p. denitrificans sd <dig>  <cit>  and paracoccus sp. n <dig> . in this study we add the genome of p. aminophilus jcm  <dig> and comparative analysis of five paracoccus spp. genomes is now possible.

a total of  <dig> genes  can be considered as core paracoccus genes, since they are present in all five analyzed genomes . functional classification of the proteins encoded by these genes showed that, in a vast majority of cases, they belong to five cog groups  that represent basic housekeeping functions, expected to be encoded on chromosomes, and therefore conserved among bacterial genomes.

comparative genomic analyses disclosed some specific features of the p. aminophilus genome. the chromosome of strain jcm  <dig> contains  <dig> singletons  that are mainly located within prophages, although other gene clusters are also included, e.g. a type iii secretion system with  <dig> unique genes. the remaining singleton genes are encoded by the plasmids . a relatively large portion of singletons within the genome is a feature of all the analyzed paracoccus genomes, which suggests that these strains are not that closely related.

we also performed a complex phylogenetic analysis of p. aminophilus jcm  <dig> in relation to other fully sequenced members of the class alphaproteobacteria. a phylogenetic tree based on  <dig> core genes was computed . p. aminophilus jcm  <dig> is clustered together with the other completely sequenced paracoccus spp. strains, but it forms an outgroup, which indicates its “distant” relationship to representatives of other species .

CONCLUSIONS
chromids have been found in bacteria belonging to many different phyla, including actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, chloroflexi, cyanobacteria, deinococcus-thermus, firmicutes, proteobacteria and spirochaetes <cit> . it was shown that chromids of bacteria classified to separate phylogenetic groups carry replication systems of different types, which indicates that these replicons were derived from plasmid precursors typical for particular groups of hosts, and were formed independently in the course of evolution  <cit> .

chromids share a number of major characteristics:  considerable size ,  the presence of plasmid-type replication systems,  g + c nucleotide contents comparable to that of chromosomes,  codon usage similar to that of chromosomes ,  the presence of housekeeping genes, typical for chromosomes , and  the presence of adaptive genes, typical for plasmids, enabling adaptation of bacteria to a given ecological niche  <cit> . a typical feature of chromids is their high variability, resulting mainly from the low density of housekeeping genes. therefore, they are considered to be specific “training sites” in which different evolutionary variants are “tested”  <cit> , which leads to structural variability of multireplicon genomes in different strains of the same genus  <cit> .

the formation of multi-replicon genomes, in which the basic genomic information is split between various replicons, seems to be beneficial to bacteria. the presence of additional replicons enables more rapid duplication of the genetic information, and permits the maintenance of a larger genome while keeping a high rate of cell division. moreover, it was shown that the frequency of dimer generation by bacterial chromosomes increases exponentially in relation to their size; therefore, the reduction of chromosome size  allows minimization of this phenomenon  <cit> .

many paracoccus spp. genomes also possess a multi-replicon structure. a good example of such a genome architecture is p. aminophilus jcm  <dig>  which carries one chromosome and eight plasmid-like replicons. our in silico analyses revealed that pami <dig>  pami <dig>  pami <dig>  pami <dig> and pami <dig> carry many genes  showing homology to orfs within p. denitrificans pd <dig> chromosomes , thus they may be considered as putative chromids. however, relying only on the bioinformatic studies, the concept of essentiality of particular replicons is highly speculative, thus to define their nature we applied additional analyses.

in this study, acknowledging the importance of functional analyses, we have shown that only pami <dig> and pami <dig> should be classified as chromids, since their presence in the host cells is essential for their proper functioning. pami <dig> could not be removed from the host cells at all, and while it was possible to obtain a pami6-less derivative, this strain was unable to grow in minimal media, i.e. in conditions similar to those in the natural environment. based on this observation we propose the classification of bacterial chromids into two types: “primary” chromids , which are indispensable for host viability and carry genes of the core genome, thus their elimination from the host cells is impossible under any environmental conditions, and “secondary” chromids  which were probably formed quite recently from an evolutionary point of view . moreover, secondary chromids seems to carry a species  -specific pool of genes that are crucial for survival in the natural environment, but are not essential under “safe” laboratory conditions, thus the replicons are only “facultatively” essential  <cit> .

according to this definition, the chromosome ii of p. denitrificans pd <dig> should be reclassified as a primary chromid. it is noteworthy that chromosome ii of pd <dig> and pami <dig> carry related dnaa-like replication systems, which may be a typical feature of the primary chromids of paracoccus spp. this may facilitate further classifications of such replicons in other representative of this genus.
