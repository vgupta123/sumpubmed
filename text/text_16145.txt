BACKGROUND
the ap2/erf transcription factors superfamily is one of the largest groups of transcription factors in plants, which includes at least one apetala <dig>  domain. according to the number of ap <dig> domains, and the presence of other dna binding domains, ap2/erf can be divided into the erf, ap <dig>  rav and soloist families. the erf family encodes proteins with a single ap <dig> domain, while the ap <dig> gene family codes for transcription factors with two ap <dig> domains  <cit> . with the exception of a single ap <dig> domain, however, there is one additional b <dig> domain in the rav gene family. the b <dig> domain is a dna-binding domain conserved in other plant specific transcription factors  <cit> .

to date, two major schemes have been applied to define the erf family nomenclature. according to dna binding domain protein sequences, the erf family was divided into two major subfamilies, the erf and dreb subfamilies. erf and dreb were divided into six groups in arabidopsis <cit> . alternatively, based on ap2/erf domain amino acid sequences, arabidopsis and rice erf families were divided into  <dig> and  <dig> respective groups  <cit> . similarly,  <dig> groups were identified in the grape and cucumber erf family  <cit> .

despite high sequence conservation in the ap2/erf domain, each family exhibits different dna elements. generally, the erf subfamily binds to an agccgcc sequence, i.e. the gcc box  <cit> , while the dreb subfamily typically interacts with a ccgac core sequence  <cit> . the ap <dig> family, even with the presence of two ap <dig> domains, does not bind to the ccga/cc sequence as in dreb/erf subfamilies, but binds to the gcacntcccang element  <cit> . ap <dig> family genes are regulated by microrna , and can be divided into ap <dig> and ant groups  <cit> . rav family binds to the caaca and cacctg sequence. such as pepper carav <dig> can recognize and bind to these motifs, and activate the yeast reporter gene  <cit> .

a variety of ap2/erf transcription factors have been successfully identified and investigated in some plants, including arabidopsis, rice  <cit> , grape  <cit> , poplar   <cit> , wheat   <cit> , cucumbers  <cit> , barley   <cit> , and soybean   <cit> . the ap2/erf transcription factors regulate diverse biological processes in plant function and development, such as hormones, reproduction, cell proliferation, abiotic and biotic stress responses  <cit> .

commonly, the dreb subfamily is used as viable candidate to enhance crop abiotic stress tolerance. the dreb subfamily exhibits different response patterns under environmental stress, including low-temperature   <cit> , heat   <cit> , osmotic   <cit> , drought   <cit> , and water-deficit and high-salt stress   <cit> . the dreb transcription factors activate multiple dehydration/cold-regulated genes by interacting with dre/crt elements , which are present in the rd/cor gene promoters  <cit> . in addition, several dreb subfamily genes are reportedly positive and negative mediators of aba and sugar responses, primarily during germination and early seedling stages  <cit> .

erf transcription factors are also involved in signal pathways during environmental stress or pathogen and disease-related stimuli. erf transcription factors directly regulate pathogenesis-related  gene expression by binding dna with the gcc-box , such as pr <dig> to pr <dig>  <cit> . erf transcription factors play an important role in plant development, as well as tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress. erf transcription factor overexpression has been reported in rice  <cit> , tomato, and tobacco  <cit> , leading to drought and salt tolerant improvements in transgenic plants. signal molecules, including ja, salicylic acid , ethylene , and abscisic acid  regulate several important defense-signaling pathways. erf transcription factors potentially play a role in abiotic and biotic stress in plants, such as drought , salt , freezing   <cit> , hypoxic stress   <cit> , cell dedifferentiation   <cit> , metabolite biosynthesis , and trait development  <cit> . most of these erf transcription factors improve abiotic tolerance in crops without causing undesirable growth phenotypes  <cit> . however crl <dig>  an ap <dig> subfamily in rice, promoted crown root initiation in response to aba  <cit> . moreover, crl <dig> affected sepal abscission , plant height , and leaf shape in brassica napus, water lily, and maize  <cit> . the rav family was shown to mediate plant defense during abiotic and biotic stress. carav <dig> overexpression increased tolerance to high salinity and osmotic stress in arabidopsis, and the b. napus rav-1-hy <dig> gene was induced by cold, nacl, and peg treatments  <cit> . these observations emphasize the importance of identifying all ap2/erf superfamily genes to interpret the mechanisms underlying stress signal transmission, and ultimately manipulate ap2/erf protein regulation to improve crop stress resistance. erf-mediated plant defense responses can be better understood by elucidating the signaling pathways involved in defense response regulation.

chinese cabbage, a member of the genus brassica, is an important leaf vegetable crop grown worldwide. the chinese cabbage genome  was recently sequenced and assembled. data indicated b. rapa ssp. pekinensis exhibits a close relationship with a. thaliana, and experienced a whole genome triplication since its divergence from arabidopsis  <dig> to  <dig> mya  <cit> . the release of the entire chinese cabbage genome sequence, as well as others, including arabidopsis, potato, and tomato, provided us an opportunity for comparative genome research on ap2/erf transcription factors. characterization of ap2/erf superfamily genes in b. rapa ssp. pekinensis can serve to clarify the molecular mechanisms responsible for abiotic and biotic stress responses, such as cold, heat, salt, or disease resistance. subsequently, brassica varieties with increased tolerance to many adverse environments can be developed using transgenic technology. a recent study reported  <dig> ap2/erf superfamily genes using expressed sequence tags  in chinese cabbage  <cit> . in this study, we systematically and comprehensively describe the ap2/erf transcription factors in b. rapa ssp. pekinensis through a comparative genome analysis. the objectives of our study were as follows:  identify and characterize the ap2/erf transcription factors in the b. rapa ssp. pekinensis genome;  analyze ap2/erf transcription factor phylogenetic relationships and orthologous genes between the b. rapa ssp. pekinensis and a. thaliana genome; and  construct ap2/erf transcription factor interaction networks, and analyze ap2/erf transcription factor expression patterns through comparative genomics. ests were applied in ap2/erf transcription factor expression analyses.

RESULTS
identification of the ap2/erf family transcription factors in chinese cabbage
our extensive search for ap2-domain containing proteins identified  <dig> distinct ap2/erf putative transcription factors . a total of  <dig> genes with a single ap2/erf domain were assigned to the erf family. twenty-nine genes were grouped into the ap <dig> family, twenty of which were identified due to the tandem repeated double ap2/erf motif. the remaining nine genes  contained only one ap <dig> domain, however these genes exhibited high similarity with the arabidopsis ap <dig> family. in fact, the single ap <dig> domain was similarly reported in arabidopsis, e.g. at <dig>  at <dig>  and at <dig>  fourteen genes, with a single ap2/erf dna binding domain and a b <dig> domain, were assigned to the rav family. the br <dig> gene was not only divergent from the erf family, but was homologous to arabidopsis soloist . a similar gene was identified in p. trichocarpa and named soloist.

we subdivided the chinese cabbage ap2/erf genes into  <dig> groups, based on conserved domain similarities to arabidopsis ap2/erf transcription factors. cumulatively, the number of ap2/erf transcription factors in chinese cabbage exceeded that in poplar , rice , and potato . chinese cabbage ap2/erf transcription factors were nearly two times that detected in grape , tomato , and arabidopsis . the rav family number in chinese cabbage  was larger than in other plant groups, including arabidopsis , rice , tomato  and potato . the ap <dig> family domain number was equal in chinese cabbage  and potato, but rice showed more , and arabidopsis , and tomato  fewer, among other species. the soloist protein, coded by a single-copy gene and characterized by low conservation at the erf dna-binding domain, was detected in all higher plant genomes examined. the number of dreb, erf, and rav transcription factors in chinese cabbage exceeded that in each species analyzed. all five ap2/erf families existed in the higher plants examined, with the exception of pinus taeda and picea sitchensis, where the rav family was absent. in some lower plants, only the ap <dig> family and erf subfamily were identified. ap2/erf transcription factors were not identified in lichens, fungi, and other lower plants in our analyses .

phylogenetic analysis of ap2/erf transcription factors family
the evolutionary relationship between chinese cabbage and arabidopsis based on ap2/erf transcription factors was assessed by phylogenetic reconstruction using the conserved ap2/erf transcription factor domain. the resulting phylogenetic tree  resolved  <dig> clades, containing the erf, ap <dig>  rav and soloist families, congruent with previous studies  <cit> . groups i to vi represent the erf subfamily, and vii to xii the dreb subfamily. groups xiii, xiv and xv respectively indicate the ap <dig>  rav and soloist families. although the soloist transcription factor contained a single ap <dig> domain in chinese cabbage, it clustered with the rav family, while the soloist transcription factor grouped with the ap <dig> family in grape  <cit> . we conducted a more in depth phylogenetic analysis of the ap <dig> family by selecting the ap <dig> family proteins, which contain two ap <dig> domains. chinese cabbage and arabidopsis were divided into two groups, which we named ap2-r <dig> and ap2-r <dig>  a third group of ap <dig> transcription factors were formed when a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the ap <dig> family proteins of all species analyzed .

the conservative motifs among ap2/erf proteins in plants were clarified by performing multiple alignment analyses using amino acid sequences of the ap2/erf domain. for each ap2/erf family, several genes were selected in one of each species to identify the motifs. sequence alignment showed the motif length in the rav family was longest, and contained  <dig> amino acids, followed by dreb and soloist . however, in the ap <dig> family,  <dig> amino acids were detected in the motif. the ap <dig> family contained two groups , which might be responsible for the reduced motif length. on the one hand, the divergence between two groups might affect the ap <dig> family motif length. generally, the higher the divergence, the shorter the motif. the same explanation might be used for the erf subfamily , which contained six groups, and also exhibited a shorter conserved motif. although six groups were identified in the dreb and erf subfamilies, the conserved motif was much longer than in the erf subfamily . the differences within the ap2/erf family were further analyzed by examining the dreb, erf and ap <dig> conserved motifs using the meme program. the results showed five of six erf groups had a  <dig> amino acid conserved motif, with the exception of the erfb <dig> group, which contained  <dig> amino acids in the conserved motif . therefore, if the erf subfamily motif length was dependent on the erfb <dig> group, it might be responsible for the overall shorter erf subfamily motif. in the dreb subfamily, a shorter conserved motif was observed in dreba <dig> compared to the remaining dreb group , and it showed increased similarity to dreba <dig> to dreba <dig> groups . the ap2-r <dig> group contained  <dig> amino acids in the conserved motif, and  <dig> amino acids were identified in the ap2-r <dig> group conserved motif .

sequence alignment of all ap2/erf families indicated that lg, aa, and yd elements were highly conserved . the wlg element in dreb, erf, and rav was more highly conserved than in ap <dig> and soloist . in the ap <dig> family, some wlg elements converted into ylg elements, however in the soloist family, wlg converted into hlg elements. the ayd element was conserved in the ap2/erf superfamily, with the exception of dreb and soloist, where it was converted into the ahd element in the dreba <dig> and dreba <dig> groups. in the soloist family, the lyd element replaced ayd .

orthologous ap2/erf genes between chinese cabbage and arabidopsis
comparative genome analysis confirmed chinese cabbage underwent genome triplication since its divergence from a. thaliana. therefore, many collinear blocks were observed between the chinese cabbage and arabidopsis genomes. interestingly, gene number in the chinese cabbage genome was notably less than three times the arabidopsis gene number. these results indicated gene loss during polyploid speciation in many eukaryotes  <cit> . comparative analysis was applied to identify orthologous ap2/erf transcription factors to assess ap2/erf gene triplication between chinese cabbage and arabidopsis; and orthologous genes were shown using the circos program. using blast, we compared ap2/erf transcription factors, and resolved  <dig> genes in chinese cabbage, which exhibited a higher sequence similarity  with  <dig> arabidopsis genes. these results demonstrated that in chinese cabbage, the ap2/erf transcription factor duplication accompanied genome triplication . results indicated three of the  <dig> genes anchored in the scaffolds . the accession numbers are respectively bra <dig>  bra <dig>  and bra <dig> in the chinese cabbage databank. an interaction network was constructed associated with ap2/erf arabidopsis orthologs using ap2/erf genes from chinese cabbage. pearson correlation coefficient of seventy-seven gene pairs was greater than zero, and twenty-five gene pairs was less than zero . furthermore, we investigated the chinese cabbage paralogous ap2/erf transcription factors. one hundred sixty nine ap2/erf transcription factors showed high homology  to the ap2/erf proteins . the orthologous and paralogous genes were indicated in the phylogenetic tree .

duplication events have been studied in grape, and  <dig> proteins with high similarity sequences were reported  <cit> . we identified  <dig> duplicated genes in the chinese cabbage genome, with a 95% sequence similarity. among the  <dig> duplicated genes,  <dig> were classified as erf subfamily, and the remaining were determined dreb subfamily genes .

chromosome distribution of the ap2/erf family transcription factors
among all ap2/erf family transcription factors resolved in the chinese cabbage genome,  <dig> genes belong to the erf subfamily, followed by dreb , ap <dig> , rav  and soloist  transcription factors . the  <dig> total ap2/erf transcription factors were distributed on the  <dig> chinese cabbage chromosomes , and three genes could not be assigned to any specific chromosome. chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> had the highest number of ap2/erf transcription factors, with  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively; and the lowest ap2/erf transcription factor number was found on chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig> . the high ap2/erf sequence number on these two chromosomes was primarily due to the increased number of dreb  and erf  subfamilies. the subfamilies were responsible for  <dig> % and 90% of the total ap2/erf superfamily on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. interestingly, results identified conserved sequences and physical proximity of repetitive transcription factors, which belong to the same group, and were located on the same chromosomal regions, as follows: br <dig> to br <dig> , and br <dig> to br <dig>  were located on chromosome 1; br <dig> to br <dig> , and br <dig> to br <dig>  were located on chromosome 7; br <dig> to br <dig> , and br <dig> to br <dig>  were located on chromosome 8; br <dig> to br <dig> , and br <dig> to br <dig> , and br <dig> to br <dig> , and br <dig> to br <dig>  were located on chromosome  <dig>  similar patterns were also found in the arabidopsis <cit> , grape, and poplar genomes  <cit> , which were suggested to represent paralogous segments resulting from ancestral polyploidization events. the highest rav transcription factor number was found on chromosome  <dig> , followed by chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> , while rav transcription factors were not detected on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> 

ap2/erf superfamily transcription factor expression patterns in chinese cabbage
ap2/erf transcription factors were integral in plant growth. therefore, we constructed ap2/erf transcription factor functional pathways for comprehensive research. the pathway diagrams showed that  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> ap2/erf proteins were involved in metabolic and regulatory pathways, and secondary metabolic biosynthesis, respectively . ap2/erf protein function in chinese cabbage was examined by predicting tissue function and expression using ests. to date,  <dig>  total ests, more than  <dig>  unique genes, and a corresponding expression profile of chinese cabbage have been published. these data provided us with rich resources for gene discovery, genome annotation, and studies of gene expression patterns. a total of  <dig> ap2/erf transcription factors were obtained by expression profile tags , which contained  <dig>  erf,  <dig>  dreb,  <dig>  ap <dig>   <dig>  rav, and  <dig>  soloist genes . the expression patterns of these ap2/erf transcription factors in various tissues, and analysis of the overall similarities and differences among transcriptomes of different tissues or organs were obtained by performing coordinated gene expression analyses of chinese cabbage ests derived from different tissue types. the ap2/erf transcription factors were detected in six tissues, including buds, flowers, leaves, roots, seeds, and siliques. ap2/erf transcription factor transcripts were most abundant in roots  <dig>  , followed by seeds  <dig>  , leaves  <dig>  , and flowers  <dig>  . few ap2/erf superfamily genes were detected in siliques  <dig>   and buds  <dig>   .

the  <dig> ap2/erf transcription factors were detected in some tissues but not others . the highest number of transcription factors was found in coexisting in leaves, roots and seeds , followed by genes coexisting in flowers, leaves, roots and seeds , and in roots  . furthermore,  <dig>  genes were identified in all six tissues, which contained eight erf genes, and three dreb genes. in which, the br163-erf-b <dig> and br240-erf-b <dig> showed the higher expression in flower than other genes. gene number in buds, flowers, leaves, roots and seeds was respectively  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  however gene expression was not detected in siliques. ap2/erf gene expression in the six tissues varied; expression peaks were detected for the br112-erf-b <dig> gene in the roots. the dreb subfamily exhibited the highest expression in siliques for the br001-dreb-a <dig> gene, while it was not detected in leaves and seeds. the br008-erf-b <dig> showed the highest expression level in leaves and seeds compared to the other genes. surprisingly, the br201-erf-b <dig> gene showed the highest expression levels in buds compared to other genes and tissues. especially, it was not expressed in other five tissues. results showed high expression in seeds for the rav family, which demonstrated rav transcription factors were primarily related to fruit development. expression levels of ap <dig> transcription factors were lower than most other ap2/erf genes, and mainly expressed in flowers, buds, seeds, and roots. detailed expression values and clusters of each ap2/erf transcription factor were analyzed using cluster analysis based on est tags from each tissue type .

ap2/erf protein annotations and interactions among specific proteins
the predicted chinese cabbage ap2/erf superfamily proteins were annotated based on alignment to trembl, iprscan, swissprot, go and kegg databases using blastp at an e value of 1 × 10− <dig>  each ap2/erf protein annotation from the five protein databases was integrated, and results provided in a supplemental file . most ap2/erf proteins belong to the erf and dreb subfamily. it is interesting we identified seven cbf-like proteins according to the arabidopsis functional information, which might be related to freezing tolerance in chinese cabbage. six of the seven genes were identified as the dreba <dig> group, and one protein was classified with the dreba <dig> group. subsequently, chinese cabbage and arabidopsis protein interactions, including functional and physical interactions were examined used string software and the corresponding database to retrieve the among protein interactions. five proteins, which exhibited increased sequence similarity with cbf <dig>  and cbf <dig>  were involved in one interaction network. the br <dig> gene, which showed high homology with cbf <dig> was involved in another network with the vrn <dig> protein . the former network largely participated in cold regulatory pathways, as most factors affected cold stress, including pif <dig>  los <dig>  cbf <dig>  cbf <dig>  and ada2a <cit> . former research suggests the vrn <dig> and cbf <dig> network might be involved in vernalization, flowering time, or drought adaptation  <cit> . we also found four proteins  in the ap <dig> family associated with ovule development; and br <dig> interacted with asn <dig>  bzo2h <dig> and din <dig> .

discussion
chinese cabbage is a member of the brassica genus, and b. rapa crops are widely used as vegetables, oilseed, condiments, and fodder. given the important economic value of the species, and its close relationship to a. thaliana, the chinese cabbage genome has been recently sequenced and assembled. arabidopsis, a dicotyledonous species, was the first taxon with its whole genome sequenced and released. subsequently, the entire genomes of more and more taxa were sequenced, such as the dicot species chinese cabbage, potato and tomato, and the monocot species rice, among many other plant taxa. these data provided us with rich resources for comparative genomic analyses. furthermore, with the rapid development in bioinformatics analyses, the information stored in various plant genomes could be explored to elucidate the mechanisms regulating plant growth and development. plant genome analysis could also facilitate genome and gene evolution studies.

recent research in structural and functional genomics in higher plant model species e.g. arabidopsis and rice  <cit>  have shown thousands of transcription factors are involved in stress response and plant development. the ap2/erf genes are viable candidates to improve abiotic and biotic stress in plants, including cold, heat, drought, salt, fungal, and bacterial pathogens. for example, some erf proteins exhibit resistance to a wide range of pathogens. furthermore, the ap2/erf transcription regulators are involved in plant metabolite biosynthesis and trait development, e.g. flowers and roots  <cit> . however, the ap2/erf gene characters in chinese cabbage remain unknown. therefore, it is essential to identify and annotate the new ap2/erf genes in chinese cabbage. in the present study, we identified all ap2/erf transcription factors in the whole chinese cabbage genome, and characterized the transcription factors expression patterns in six different tissues.

a comparison of species homologs, including sequenced genomes and expression profiles, might aid in understanding the role of these transcription factors in chinese cabbage. we assume transcription regulators within the same taxonomic group exhibit recent common evolutionary origins, and specific conserved motifs related to molecular functions. we use this assumption as an effective and practical means to predict unknown protein functions, derived from structural relationships in arabidopsis <cit> . due to the close relationship between chinese cabbage and arabidopsis, the highly homologous genes were identified and used to predict functions in chinese cabbage. finally, we identified five ap2/erf genes, which showed high similarity  with corresponding genes in arabidopsis . following the homologous gene annotations in arabidopsis, we determined the five ap2/erf gene functional roles in chinese cabbage. for example, the br270-erf-b <dig> transcription factor, which exhibited high sequence similarity with the at3g <dig> gene, likely act as a negative regulator of ja-responsive defense gene expression, and antagonizes ja inhibition of root elongation  <cit> . the annotation of br214-erf-b <dig>  showed it is a disease resistance gene  <cit> , and br012-erf-b <dig>  was a positive regulator of gibberellic acid-induced germination  <cit> , while br008-erf-b <dig>  is a negative regulator of transcription  <cit> . the br047-ap <dig>  is involved in storage compound biosynthesis control, and the mutants had a wrinkled seed phenotype  <cit> .

in the present study, we analyzed the ap2/erf transcription factor superfamily in chinese cabbage and  <dig> other species, representing red and green algae, non-vascular and vascular plants, lichens, and fungi. in higher plants, most ap2/erf genes have been assigned to the ap <dig> and erf families. the erf subfamily gene number exceeded dreb and ap <dig> genes. however in lower plants, the number of ap <dig> family genes was more than other transcription factors . for the  <dig> species we examined, ap2/erf transcription factors were not detected in fungi, lichens, and two algal species .

we conducted a comprehensive search for ap2/erf transcription factors throughout the chinese cabbage genome, and identified  <dig> genes. a previous study reported  <dig> ap2/erf transcription factors using ests  <cit> . compared to the species considered in this study, the chinese cabbage genome supports large erf and dreb subfamilies. the greatest number of ap <dig> transcription factors has been identified in rice  relative to other species, however the number was similar among chinese cabbage , arabidopsis , tomato  and potato . rav family genes have been determined highly conserved among dicot species, which generally contain six members  <cit> . however, we identified  <dig> rav family genes in chinese cabbage, and three and two genes assigned to the rav family in tomato and potato, respectively. comparative and phylogenetic analyses of ap2/erf transcription regulators in chinese cabbage and other species served as a first step in comprehensive functional characterization of ap2/erf transcription factors by reverse genetic approaches and molecular genetics research.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study we identified  <dig> ap2/erf transcription factors in the chinese cabbage genome. isolation and identification of these functional and transcription factor genes are likely to assist in clarifying the molecular genetics basis for chinese cabbage genetic improvement, and also provide the functional gene resources for transgenic research. these data also constructed the gene network that portrays the control of chinese cabbage development. to date, few genes representing this transcription factor superfamily have been characterized in detail from chinese cabbage. therefore, this is the first comprehensive and systematic research in chinese cabbage ap2/erf transcription factors. in silico analyses may assist in elucidating ap2/erf family gene function in protein interactions, signaling pathway regulations, and defense responses under different stress conditions. furthermore, it also might provide new opportunities to discover chinese cabbage tolerance mechanisms under stress conditions. the ap2/erf superfamily bioinformatics analysis results provided basic resources to examine the molecular regulation of chinese cabbage development and stress resistance. in addition, the comparative study between chinese cabbage and other species generated valuable information to study ap2/erf transcription factor function for economic, agronomic, and ecological benefit in chinese cabbage.
