BACKGROUND
neurodegenerative disorders, such as parkinson's and alzheimer's disease, stroke, epilepsy or trauma are characterized by a loss of neurons. neural tissue has a limited capacity of repair after injury and neural stem cells are localized to a selected region. different studies have proposed the use of fetal neural stem cells or neural cells derived from embryonic stem cells to treat brain injury  <cit> . however, their use is limited by ethical considerations and other scientific problems.

it has been demonstrated that mesenchymal stromal cells  may play a role in neurogenesis or repair brain injury  <cit> . expanded msc were injected in different parts of the brain  in a mouse model of parkinson's disease, albino-rat or injured spinal cord rat. from five days to  <dig> weeks post-injection the migration of msc and the expression of typical markers for neurons or astrocytes were observed. msc can also promote the neuronal recovery  <cit> . using co-cultures with mesencephalic cells, hippocampal brain slice or cerebellar granule neurons, some investigators have demonstrated the differentiation of bone marrow-msc  into cells expressing neuronal/glial proteins. these results suggest that cell-cell contacts play an important role in neural differentiation  <cit> . however, in these both cases  the fusion between msc and neuron/glial cells cannot be excluded.

in vitro the neural differentiation of msc documented in literature required  <dig> hours to  <dig> days to obtain cells with morphologic and expression patterns similar to "real" neurons  <cit> . however typical morphology observed with long thin neuritis like neurons seems associated with chemical cytotoxicity induced by the neurogenic medium. in fact, the use of dimethyl sulfoxide , beta-mercaptoethanol  or butyl hydroxyanisole  may cause retraction of the cytoplasm due to a rapid disruption of actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . on the other hand, the expression of neuronal markers evaluated by immunolabeling was not always increased and was not every time confirmed by rt-pcr analysis or proteomic analysis  <cit> .

as confirm by other group, we have previously demonstrated that before any differentiation msc can express specific neural proteins  <cit> . induced cells with neuronal progenitor basal medium  or neurobasal added with a mix cytokines, demonstrate an increased expression of tyrosine hydroxylase , map- <dig>  nf, neun, gaba, nestin and gfap  <cit> .

although specific protein expression has been evaluated, little is known about the biological process, the molecular functions and the gene modulation during msc differentiation process.

in this study, to confirm the differentiation of msc to neural phenotype and to demonstrate that this differentiation is not an artifact, we performed microarray analysis to establish the gene expression profile of msc before and after neurogenic differentiation. among the  <dig> probe sets corresponding to  <dig> genes,  <dig> probe sets were modulated with a fold change of  <dig> . quantitative real time pcr was also performed to confirm microarray data. in this study, several neurogenic genes were upregulated.

our results provide the ability of msc to differentiate into neurons and to evoke a fast synaptic transmission. these results were confirmed by rapid increase level of intracellular ca 2+ level after glutamate or ampa stimuli.

RESULTS
characterization and differentiation capacity of bm-msc
we have previously demonstrated that two passages were required to isolate a homogeneous population of msc using the plastic adhesion method  <cit> . these cells displayed spindle-shape morphology and were identified by their expression for cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> but negative for all hematopoietic markers . before neurogenic induction, cells were also evaluated for their multilineage capacity. these cells can be induced to differentiate into osteocytes, adipocytes and chondrocytes lineage using specific culture media .

after  <dig> passages, more than 72% of cells naturally express nestin. nevertheless, map- <dig> and th expression were weaker, less than  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively.

after  <dig> days under neurogenic induction, the expression of nestin remains relatively stable, but we observed a dramatically increase of more mature neuronal proteins map- <dig> and th, with more than  <dig> % and  <dig> % of positive cells respectively .

microarray analysis
in the aim to confirm the neuronal differentiation of bm-msc and to determine if they can modify their gene expression profile in response to the neurogenic medium, we performed microarray analysis.

for this study, three different samples of bm-msc were investigated before and after neurogenic differentiation with affymetrix microarray analysis.

of  <dig> probes sets, a total of  <dig> upregulated genes and  <dig> downregulated genes were significantly modulated after differentiation with a fold change of  <dig> .

the identified genes were classified into different groups: neuronal channel/transport, synaptic differentiation/transmission, neuronal development, mesodermal differentiation, extra cellular matrix component, cytoskeleton and cell cycle/proliferation, regarding their function and the pathway which in they were implicated  .

recent studies demonstrated that treatment of msc with chemical agents including dmso/bha induced a neuronal morphology causing by disruption of cytoskeleton, a loss of cell-adherence but bm-msc showed signs of death  <cit> . in this study, we observed that genes implied in proliferation  were downregulated but no variation of gene expression involved in cell apoptosis or death were observed . concordant results were recently described using a similar neurogenic medium. they postulate the post-mitotic status of differentiated cells resulting by down regulation of genes implicated in the cell cycle  <cit> .

comparing the gene expression profile of human msc with cd <dig> positive cells, silva et al demonstrated that some genes were exclusively or highly represented in msc   <cit> . we observed that all of these genes are downregulated after neurogenic differentiation. moreover, the "mesenchymal stem cell protein dsc96" and the "mesoderm specific transcript , two specific genes of mesodermal lineage have an important decrease of  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold respectively after neurogenic differentiation. a decreased expression of genes involved in osteogenesis, myogenesis or lipid metabolism was also observed. differentiated cells were not able to mineralize the matrix due to the important decreased of tuft <dig>  col iv, v, xi, xii, osf- <dig> and the modification of the extracellular matrix component after the differentiation . msc were first identified for their capacity of differentiation into adipocytes or osteocytes two distinct mesodermal cell lineages. it is well established that the decrease of osteoblast differentiation is associated with increase adipocyte formation. in fact osteoporosis due to the aging correlated with an increased of adipocytes into the bone marrow  <cit> . we did not observe an increased expression of adipocyte associated genes in response to the downregulation of gene linked to osteogenesis. in contrast, genes involved in adipogenesis are decreased .

according to the downregulation of mesenchymal genes, differentiated cells have an increased expression of typical neural genes involved in the synaptic transmission, neurite outgrowth, neurotransmitter signaling/receptors and neuronal cell development. our microarray analysis revealed increased expression of synaptic protein mrna involved in the synaptic vesicle pathway, such as synaptotagmin , phospholipase d <dig>  syntaxin 1a , brain derived neurotrophic factor  and fgf <dig>  favoring the presynaptic vesicle clustering .

other genes upregulated after neurogenic induction were involved in  synaptic transmission/long term potentialisation: ca2+/calmodulin -dependent kinases , promelanin concentrating hormone , choline transporter , proenkephalin ,  neurite outgrowth and neurogenesis: neuronal growth regulator  <dig> , brain abundant membrane attached signal protein  <dig> , amphiregulin , eph receptor a <dig> , neurofilament  <dig> .  neurotransmitter receptor/transporters and channels: glutamate receptor ,, na+/sialic cotransporter , potassium voltage gated channel, subfamily g, member  <dig> , gaba  receptor associated protein-like  <dig> .

quantitative rt-pcr analysis
to confirm the gene expression profile revealed by microarray analysis, quantitative rt-pcr was carried out. representative genes involved into neural development/differentiation  and in mesodermal cell lineage  were selected from our microarray analysis. we evaluated the mrna gene expression between undifferentiated/differentiated cells in comparison with a housekeeping gene . as show in figure  <dig>  using quantitative real-time pcr, we confirmed the increased expression of epha <dig>  ampa <dig>  negr <dig>  nef <dig> and penk by differentiated msc ten days after neurogenic induction. in contrast, genes expressed naturally by bm-msc were downregulated after neurogenic induction .

calcium influx
increased mrna expression of a high number of neural synaptic genes by microarray or real-time pcr by differentiated bm-msc is not sufficient to demonstrate the differentiation status. it will be important that neural-like cells obtained after in vitro differentiation of bm-msc were functional and able to have synaptic transmission potential.

excitory synaptic currents are mediated by different types of glutamate receptor channels including ampa <dig>  also named gria <dig> or glur <dig>  calcium influx plays an important role in the synaptic transmission. in this way, we investigated the calcium influx though gria <dig> receptor. ca2+ influx was measured using fluo- <dig> nw assay kit in the presence of glutamate , or ampa  both agonist of gria <dig> and cnqx , antagonist of gria <dig> 

treatment of gria <dig> with ampa or glutamate, demonstrated an important increased of ca2+ influx in comparison with the addition of cnqx, the specific antagonist of gria <dig>  were demonstrated. the presence of cnqx completely abolished the entry of ca2+ through the ampa <dig> receptor.

all measures were tested in a calcium buffer containing  <dig>  μm of free ca2+. these results suggest both the fully differentiation of bm-msc into phenotypical neurons but also their functionality in our neurogenic conditions.

discussion
accordingly to easy accessibility within the bone marrow and the important potential of differentiation, bm-msc represent interesting candidates for gene therapy, tissue engineering and a wide range of regenerative medicine applications  <cit> . recent observations demonstrated the capacity of bm-msc to migrate and to differentiate into various damaged tissues. however, molecular mechanisms implied in the differentiation process remain largely unknown. a great number of studies have evaluated the neuronal differentiation potential of bm-msc in vitro, using different protocols of induction. dmso, ra, bha, ibmx or bme were used as inducible agents, and morphologic changes of bm-msc were rapidly observed  with variable percentage of cell expressing neuronal markers . in comparison with bm-msc, no expression of neuronal markers was observed during the treatment of mrc <dig> cells . this observation demonstrated the absence of cytotoxic effect on the cytoskeleton in our conditions of neurogenic induction.

the presence or absence of specific antigen expression can not prove the differentiation of msc. in fact, undifferentiated bm-msc can express a large number of antigens from other tissues in which they reside  <cit> .

during the differentiation process and contrasting to previous studies, we did not observed morphological changes within a few hours using our neurogenic induction medium  <cit> . an average of four days was required to display cells with neuron-like characteristics, and ten days to obtain more than 70–80% of differentiated bm-msc. removing the neurogenic medium the differentiated bm-msc did not spontaneously return to their fibroblastic morphology within the  <dig> hours. due to stability of the differentiated state, we decided to analyze the profile of gene expression during the differentiating process.

using the microarray technology a great number of genes can be compared in undifferentiated and differentiated bm-msc and could explain the mechanism of neuronal differentiation. the protein expression profiles of msc and osteoblasts revealed an important decreased expression of calmodulin, calponin, calpain, caldesmon and many others, after differentiation of msc  <cit> . during the neuronal differentiation of bm-msc, we observed similar decrease of mrna levels corresponding to proteins involved in matrix mineralization. interestingly, using our neuronal induction protocol, we also observed that genes implicated in neurogenesis are increased and specially those in relation with the synaptic transmission . indeed, each gene taken separately, we cannot conclude that bm-msc can differentiate into neurons. but assembling all upregulated/downregulated genes, the differentiation potential of msc into neural cell lineage seems confirmed. analysing these results, we observed that genes implicated in neuronal differentiation of neuronal precursors, including socs <dig>  sfrp <dig>  amphiregulin, neuronal growth regulator  <dig> and epha <dig>  were also upregulated after neurogenic differentiation of bm-msc  <cit> . more interestingly, in comparison of genes associated during neural differentiation process of human embryonic stem cells or human brain with our results, we also found increased expression of penk, stk <dig>  igfbp <dig>  slc17a <dig>  slc6a <dig>  nurr <dig>  nrp <dig>  moxd <dig>  shh and neurod <dig>  <cit> . taken together with th expression demonstrated by flow cytometry, we speculate that our neurogenic medium can promote the neuronal-dopaminergic differentiation pathway. nevertheless, persistent high expression of nestin after  <dig> days of differentiation suggest the presence of mixed cell population at different stages of maturation or differentiation. however, the important decreased of genes involved in the proliferation suggests the post-mitotic state of these differentiated cells.

a recent study evaluating genes implied in neuronal differentiation of msc, evidenced by oligo gearrays specially used to neural study , demonstrated a large up-regulation of genes. more interestingly, as observed in our study, they also demonstrated the arrested growth of treated cells by important decrease of cell-cycle specific genes without increase of proapoptotic genes. they demonstrated also their functionality by the production of neurotransmitters and synaptic vesicle release of dopamine in response to a depolarizing stimulus  <cit> .

using similar neurogenic medium , msc expressed dopaminergic specific genes  or antagonist . ampa evoked an increased calcium influx in comparison with calcium alone or in presence of antagonist .

these recent finding cannot exclude the possibility that complete differentiation or maturation of differentiated cells require more specific factors. in fact, the microenvironment of each tissue plays an important role in the growth and differentiation of stem cells including local secreted factors, cell-cell interactions and extracellular matrix. it has been demonstrated that co-cultures with neurons or astrocytes are required for the functionality of bm-msc derived neural cells  <cit> . after short co-culture period with neuro/glial cells, the neuro-mesenchymal cells were able to conduct single-action potentials as real neurons.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the neurogenic induction protocol used in this study has no cytotoxic effect on msc and promotes their differentiation into functional dopaminergic neurons as demonstrated by flow cytometry, rt-pcr, microarray and calcium influx. this medium will be important to guide their differentiation for future clinical uses in neurodegenerative diseases.
