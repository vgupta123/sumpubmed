BACKGROUND
non-digestible carbohydrates like fructo-oligosaccharides  stimulate the gut microflora and are therefore presumed to improve host resistance to intestinal infections. for this reason non-digestible carbohydrates are added to a growing list of products, including baby-formula, bread, dairy products. many studies, including our own, showed that non-digestible carbohydrates indeed affect intestinal microflora composition  <cit> . however, there is little evidence that these non-digestible carbohydrates strengthen intestinal resistance to infection and gut barrier function.

for this reason, several strictly controlled rat infection studies were previously performed at our lab. these studies consistently showed that the non-digestible carbohydrates inulin, lactulose and fos increase translocation of salmonella to extra-intestinal organs  <cit> . a dose-dependent increase in salmonella translocation was observed in fos-fed rats  <cit> . stimulation of salmonella translocation by dietary fos was reflected in transcriptional changes in colon. genes involved in antimicrobial defense, immune response and inflammation were induced by salmonella infection of rats on a control diet and further upregulated in salmonella infected rats on a fos diet  <cit> . moreover, intestinal barrier parameters were already affected by fos before infection. in particular intestinal permeability was increased by fos before salmonella challenge. also, luminal cytotoxicity and faecal mucin excretion were increased in fos-fed rats and may indicate mucosal irritation  <cit> .

the intestinal barrier is mainly formed by the mucosal epithelial lining. disturbed barrier function can be monitored by measurement of epithelial permeability using inert permeability markers such as different kind of sugars or credta  <cit> . it has been shown that increased transport of large molecules or antigens due to increased permeability may initiate inflammation  <cit> . several mechanisms have been implicated in the mucosal barrier. tight junctions tightly connect the epithelial cells and regulate paracellular transport of fluids, electrolytes and small compounds  <cit> . modification or cellular translocation of the tight junction molecules zo <dig> and several claudins have indeed been observed in inflammatory bowel disease  and chronic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  use, both characterized by increased intestinal permeability  <cit> .

in addition to changes in epithelial tight junctions, balance between apoptosis and proliferation, or regeneration, is also a major determinant of an intact mucosal epithelial lining  <cit> . increased apoptosis can induce epithelial leakage as shown in colonic epithelial cell lines and in intestinal biopsy specimens of ibd patients  <cit> .

apart from tight junctions and apoptosis, secretory products of intestinal epithelial cells are known to play a role in mucosal barrier. the different intestinal epithelial cells; enterocytes, goblet cells, paneth cells and enteroendocrine cells, are equipped with defense mechanisms. for instance paneth cells in the crypt base produce antimicrobials, such as defensins, lysozyme and pla2g2a  <cit> , to regulate and restrict the bacterial load in the gut lumen. goblet cells produce mucins to form a mucus layer, this layer functions as a physical barrier that protects the epithelial cells from harmful compounds  <cit> . furthermore, the immune system plays an important role in mucosal integrity  <cit> . whether other processes are involved and the relative importance of these mechanisms for intestinal barrier integrity is not known. also it is not known if any of the above mentioned mechanisms or others are responsible for the effect of fos on gut permeability.

therefore, we analyzed colonic gene expression changes in individual rats fed a 6% fos diet for  <dig> weeks. analyzing fos induced gene expression using whole genome microarrays allowed us to not only focus on the above mentioned mechanisms, but to obtain an unbiased view on processes affected by dietary fos. this facilitates identification of genes and processes currently unknown to be related to barrier function. the colon had our main interest as fos and other non-digestible carbohydrates are exclusively fermented in the distal gut in humans  <cit>  and rats  <cit> . we aimed to identify the in vivo biological mechanisms involved in fos-induced weakening of the barrier in rats.

RESULTS
food intake, body weight gain, and intestinal permeability
rats on the control diet and fos diet showed no significant difference in body weight gain. both dietary groups consumed the provided  <dig> grams of diet per day as intended and thus had a similar dietary credta intake. intestinal permeability was examined by measurement of credta excretion in urine and showed that fos fed rats had increased urinary excretion of this inert permeability marker as compared to the control group .

gene expression profile
 <dig> probes on the array had an expression value of  <dig>  times above background. of these  <dig> were induced and  <dig> were reduced more than  <dig>  fold in fos fed rats compared with rats fed the control diet. only  <dig> probes were induced more than 2-fold. while gene expression changes induced by fos supplementation were small, there were many significantly changed probes in the dataset:  <dig> had a p-value <  <dig> , and  <dig> probes had a fdr derived q-value <  <dig> . this indicated that the gene expression response of colon mucosa to fos was small in magnitude, but highly significant. as each probe signal is tested independently in t-test and multiple testing increases the risk for finding false positives, we also applied random forest  <cit> . rf ranks genes based on an importance value taking main treatment effect as well as gene-gene interaction into account  <cit> . using rf, we identified  <dig> probes with an importance value above threshold.  <dig> were selected by both the t-test and rf. to prevent loss of information, we used all genes selected by t-test and rf. this resulted in a list of  <dig> probes.  <dig> corresponding genes were listed more than once. therefore, duplicates with the highest p-values were removed, resulting in  <dig> unique genes regulated by fos

gene selection by t-test or rf alone substantially overlapped and did result in a highly comparable outcome in pathway analysis, showing that the main effects extracted by both methods were similar. however, the individual gene selection differed slightly between both methods. we choose to include all genes selected by either method.

effect of fos on the expression of barrier associated genes
as fos affects the mucosal barrier, we specifically analyzed genes that are known or assumed to play a role in barrier function. these include tight junction genes like zo- <dig>  occludin and claudin, cell turnover/apoptosis genes such as caspases, bak, bcl- <dig>  and mucosal defense genes such as defensins, lipocalin, toll like receptors and iga . tight junction related genes were not affected by fos. several apoptosis  and mucosal defense genes  were increased by fos . however, no fos effect was found on other mucosal defense genes like iga, mucin  <dig> &  <dig>  defensins, lipocalin, calprotectin, and most toll-like receptors. in addition, some markers of apoptosis were slightly affected , while most  were not affected by fos.

genes most prominently affected by fos
we examined the top  <dig> of genes most affected by the fos diet . we choose the genes most prioritized by rf. these genes were characterized by extremely low p-values and relatively high fold changes. the genes were related to nutrient homeostasis , energy metabolism  and atp synthase ), protein turnover ), oxidative stress response ) and retinol metabolism ). this top- <dig> list indicates that fos especially affects cellular energy metabolism in rat colonic mucosa, this was supported by the pathway analysis results, as described below.

pathway analysis
pathway analysis identified processes most affected by dietary fos in colonic mucosa.  <dig> genes of the  <dig> selected genes could be classified based on go term or based on genego annotation in the metacore database  <cit> . the most significant processes were an entire range of mitochondria related processes such as mitochondrial electron transport, oxidative phosphorylation, translation in mitochondria and proteins targeted to mitochondria . another highly classified process was proteolysis . to prevent bias in biological interpretation due to gene selection , we also applied gene set enrichment analysis  which includes all genes in the dataset . we focused on curated gene-sets originating from genmapp, biocarta, sigmaaldrich and broad institute. comparable biological processes were found by gsea as observed in metacore: again oxidative phosphorylation was most significant, followed by proteasomal degradation . thus the threshold based metacore analysis and the threshold free enrichment analysis, gsea, gave similar results for the most significantly changed processes by fos. the results obtained by pathway programs consist of many overlapping pathways. we combined pathways with overlapping genes such as mitochondrial electron transport , electron transport  and electron transport chain  and categorized the processes.

analysis based on pathway programs is restricted to the well annotated genes  <cit> . as only 36% of the agilent whole genome array is recognized by metacore and only 35% by gsea, we manually extended the significantly altered pathways with the non-recognized genes using literature and databases mining . this strengthened the pathway outcome, as we were able to identify many additional genes affected by fos that could be added to the processes already identified by the pathway programs. this was the case for transcription identified by metacore as nucleosome assembly, cell turnover identified by gsea as programmed cell death, cytoskeleton and vesicle related processes  and oxidative stress  . in addition, we identified fos affected genes that were not grouped into a pathway by both programs but obviously belong to the same biological process, this was the case for mucosal barrier, transport, and peptide hormones .

detailed analysis of the mitochondrial processes showed an increased expression of genes associated with al five complexes of the oxphos complex, tca-cycle and mitochondrial ribosomes and mitochondrial protein transport . in addition to protein degradation, which was found in the pathway programs, protein translation and maturation were also affected by fos. from these  <dig> genes more than 90% showed increased expression upon fos indicating increased protein turnover . detailed gene expression data for all processes mentioned in table  <dig> is presented in additional file  <dig>

confirmation of array results by q-pcr
confirmation of fos induced processes was performed by q-pcr. genes from several fos affected processes were analyzed by individual q-pcr. we selected nine genes from mitochondria related processes: nadh dehydrogenase   <dig> beta subcomplex  <dig> , succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit b , ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase binding protein , cytochrome c oxidase subunit viib , atp synthase h+ transporting mitochondrial f <dig> complex subunit g , aldo-keto reductase family  <dig> member b <dig> , malic enzyme  <dig> , mitochondrial ribosomal protein s <dig> , translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane  <dig> homolog b . in addition, one gene from protein degradation proteasome subunit alpha type 3-like , two genes related to mucosal barrier phospholipase a <dig>  group iia   and trefoil factor  <dig>  and one gene from the peptide hormones, proglucagon  were analyzed. we additionally selected retinol binding protein  <dig>  as this gene was highest induced by fos . q-pcr fully confirmed the microarray data . the p-value in the q-pcr analysis reached significance  for  <dig> out of  <dig> genes. two genes had a p-value >  <dig>  .

confirmation of gene expression results on protein level
to substantiate the fos induced transcriptional modulation of mitochondrial genes at the protein level, we analyzed pooled mucosal scrapings of all rats . the small increase in mrna levels of complex iv subunits , was confirmed by a similar increase  in protein levels of complex iv subunit cox ii in the fos group compared with the control group in pooled  mucosal scrapings .

the relatively high and significant induction of proglucagon gene by fos was also examined at the protein level. mucosal scrapings of randomly sampled control and fos-fed rats  were analyzed for glp- <dig> protein levels by western blot and normalized to actin. fos significantly increased glp- <dig> protein levels in colonic mucosal tissue , substantiating the gene expression findings.

discussion
the credta results showed that dietary fos increased intestinal permeability in rats in accordance with our previous study  <cit> . the fos induced increase in intestinal permeability reduces intestinal barrier function as reported earlier  <cit> . we focused on the colon since fermentation of fos occurs in cecum and colon and is very limited in the ileum  <cit> . furthermore, by additional use of lactulose/mannitol as permeability labels  <cit>  we found that fos increased intestinal permeability in the large intestine and not in the small intestine . individual colonic gene expression of  <dig> rats after ≈ <dig> weeks fos versus control feeding were explored on whole genome level and showed that the increased permeability could not be explained by changes in genes belonging to the tight junction system in the colon. no significant changes were observed in claudin  <dig> and  <dig>  cadherins or tight junction protein  <dig>  with our focus on gene expression, possible changes in protein levels and cellular localization or modification cannot be excluded.  <dig> genes related to apoptosis were affected by fos with only modest fold changes. although some pro-apoptotic genes were mildly affected , no changes were seen in many key pro-apoptotic genes such as bad, caspase  <dig> and apaf <dig>  therefore, we feel that apoptosis is not the main cause of the increased intestinal permeability observed. known mucosal defense genes such as defensins, mucins and calprotectin were also unaffected by fos. these few and small transcriptional changes in potential barrier related genes cannot explain the profound and consistent effects of fos on intestinal permeability in rats. we can not fully exclude that dilution of specific cell types in the heterogeneous cell population of mucosal scrapings has lead to undetectable levels of some expected genes, e.g. mucin genes. this could be further assessed by laser microcapture dissection, which allows isolation of specific cell types from the intestine  <cit> , and subsequent gene expression analysis by q-pcr. on the other hand, we identified multiple genes associated with energy metabolism  that were significantly modified by fos. protein turnover was also clearly affected by fos . coincidence of increased permeability and upregulation of these genes suggests that these processes play a major role in preservation of intestinal mucosal integrity.

the most striking observation was the induction of a broad range of mitochondrial genes. increased expression of mitochondrial genes is commonly observed during disturbed atp homeostasis caused by increased energy demand or decreased mitochondrial energy supply  <cit> . most of the genes reported to be changed by disturbed atp homeostasis were also induced by fos . this could be confirmed at protein level for complex iv subunit ii. together this strongly suggests that fos caused atp depletion in colonic epithelial cells.

the increase in mitochondrial genes could indicate a compensation for possible scfa – induced atp depletion. the validity of this assumption could be studied by measuring atp levels in enterocytes of fos- and control-fed rats. the clear changes of fos on mitochondrial processes were not expected beforehand, therefore no precautions were taken at the time of sampling and storage of the mucosal scrapings that would allow post-hoc analysis of atp levels. alternatively we attempted to examine levels of phosphorylated amp-activated protein kinase  as this reflects the adp/atp ratio in cells  <cit> . low levels of total ampk protein could be detected in colonic scrapings without difference between control and fos . however, ampk phosphorylation could not be detected in mucosal scrapings, most certainly because of instability of the phosphorylated protein requiring specific sample collection procedures. in addition it would be interesting to study the effects of fos on mitochondria using electron microscopy studies  <cit> .

so, the question remains whether the strongly and broadly increased expression of mitochondrial genes by fos, is associated with the observed increase in intestinal permeability in fos-fed rats. many studies using epithelial cell lines have shown that paracellular hyperpermeability is caused by atp depletion  <cit> . another strong indication that mitochondria are important in maintaining intestinal permeability is derived from studies on chronic nsaids  <cit> . direct exposure of rat intestine to the nsaid indomethacin or the mitochondrial uncoupler dnp increases epithelial permeability  <cit> , which increased bacterial translocation in rats and intestinal cell lines, and increased immune cell infiltration and ulceration in rats  <cit> . enhanced bacterial translocation reflects impaired barrier function.

in figure  <dig>  we schematically describe a possible mechanism of the fos induced increase in intestinal mitochondrial gene expression, the proposed atp-depletion and the increased mucosal permeability observed.

previous studies in rats  <cit>  and humans  <cit>  showed rapid fermentation of fos in cecum and colon by the endogenous microflora resulting in lactic acid accumulation, scfa production, and decreased ph of luminal contents. although luminal production of modest quantities of scfas is essential for normal colonic mucosal function  <cit> , overproduction or accumulation of scfa along with low ph in the intestinal lumen has been shown to cause intestinal injury leading to increased intestinal permeability in vivo  <cit>  and in vitro  <cit> . studies in liver show that scfa induced depletion of cellular atp coincided with a reduced intracellular ph   <cit> . a likely explanation for reduced phi by scfa is that in an acidic luminal environment, a relatively larger portion of scfa becomes protonated, facilitating passive diffusion of scfa across the apical hydrophobic enterocyte membrane causing intracellular acidification  <cit> . the above mentioned studies were done in vitro or in perfused liver, but the concentrations applied can impair the phi homeostasis in colonocytes in fos fed rats  <cit> . taken together, fos reduce luminal ph and increase levels of scfas, likely leading to acidification of the cellular cytoplasm . a decrease in phi is compensated by h+ excretion in exchange for na+ by the phi regulating na+/hco3- cotransporter  and the na+/h+ exchanger  in the basolateral membrane  <cit> . this indirectly activates the na+,k+-atpase  which is known to require ~25% of the cellular atp turnover under basal conditions  <cit> . long-term exposure of enterocytes to high scfa concentrations under low ph conditions might therefore disturb or exhaust plasma membrane pumps, leading to rapid atp-depletion  <cit> . fos diet significantly increased expression of atp1b <dig> . no changes were found in the gene expression of the transporters nbc and nhe, but increased activity of these transporters can occur without concomitant changes in mrna gene expression.

a strong indication supporting scfa and low luminal ph as inducers of the observed effects, are results of previous studies of our lab showing that the adverse affects of fos on mucosal barrier, i.e. increased permeability and decreased resistance to pathogens, are absent when calcium is supplemented to the diets  <cit> . calcium is known to increase the buffering capacity of luminal contents by its precipitation with dietary phosphate. by preventing acidification during fermentation, scfa will remain in the anionic form, for which the cellular plasma membrane is not permeable. other possible mechanisms may play a role, including scfa induced accumulation of acyl coa in mitochondria, opening of the pore complex or modulation of histone deacetylase activity by butyrate followed by an altered pgc <dig> expression, but none of these mechanisms were supported by consistent changes in gene expression.

the second major process affected by fos was protein turnover. fos induced  <dig> ribosomal proteins and  <dig> proteasomal genes, indicating increased protein turnover. intracellular proteins are targeted to the proteasomal degradation system by ubiquitination  <cit> . proteasomal degradation is tightly controlled and removes denatured, misfolded and damaged proteins. the clear increase in proteasomal gene expression might result from increased presence of misfolded proteins. one common cause of misfolding of cellular proteins is mild oxidative stress  <cit> . fos induced several genes related to oxidative stress, such as metallothionein- <dig>  metallothionein-1a , six glutathione s-transferases , heme oxygenase  <dig> , and superoxide dismutase  <dig> and  <dig> . an increase in oxidative stress proteins is an indirect marker for production of reactive oxygen species   <cit> . it is well recognized that induced mitochondrial activity can increase production of ros. the increased expression of oxidative stress genes and mitochondrial genes observed in the present study suggests increased mitochondrial activity, possibly associated with increased ros production and increased protein oxidation. oxidized proteins are often misfolded, and directed to proteasomes for degradation. in support, the translocase sec <dig> responsible for intracellular transport of misfolded proteins from the er to the proteasome was significantly increased  <dig>  fold  by fos.

increased proteasomal gene expression might also reflect the formation of immunoproteasomes   <cit> . the i-proteasome plays a role in antigen processing and is composed of two subunits psme <dig> and psme <dig>  <cit>  which were both significantly increased by fos supplementation. expression of these subunits is known to be induced by microbial infection and cytokines like ifnγ  <cit> . alterations in the i-proteasome in the injured intestinal epithelium are observed in colon biopsies of ibd patients and ibd-mouse models  <cit> . the increased intestinal permeability due to the fos diet can cause increased exposure of the mucosa to bacteria and therefore induce i-proteasome gene expression.

the top  <dig> most significantly changed genes by fos showed to be good representatives of the major biological processes selected from pathway analysis. in addition to genes related to mitochondria and protein turnover, two genes coding for cellular retinol-binding proteins  were highly induced by fos. rbps are required for uptake, intracellular transport and metabolism of vitamin a. vitamin a is a fat-soluble vitamin necessary for growth and differentiation of epithelial tissues. rbp <dig> and rbp <dig> belong to the fatty-acid binding protein  family. fos also significantly increased fabp <dig>  <dig>  fold. at present, we cannot explain the fos induced expression of these genes and its relation to the functional effects observed in this and our earlier fos studies.

proglucagon is one of the most highly induced gene by fos . the proglucagon gene is a precursor encoding several glucagon-like peptides. in intestinal enteroendocrine cells the gene codes for oxyntomodulin, glp <dig> and glp <dig>  <cit> . this gene was previously found to be induced by non-digestible oligosaccharides  <cit> . besides fos induced expression of proglucagon, fos induced the expression of several other gut-derived peptide hormones, namely cholecystokinin , peptide yy  and pancreatic polypeptide . increase of pyy has previously been reported in rat colon by scfa  <cit> . proglucagon, pyy, ppy and cck are all expressed by enteroendocrine l cells in colon and play a role in gut-nutrient sensing  <cit> . in the hypothalamus nutrient sensing is also regulated by these hormones and directly related to atp status  <cit> . it is speculated that the same mechanism is applicable to enteroendocrine l cells in de gut  <cit> . since in our study, increased gene expression of these  <dig> peptide hormone genes coincides with alterations in mitochondrial processes, it is tempting to speculate that these hormones also influence or respond to energy metabolism in intestinal epithelial cells. besides a role in energy homeostasis, glp- <dig>  pyy and cck have growth-promoting properties on the intestinal epithelium in vivo  <cit> . glp <dig> stimulated cell proliferation has been reported for liver and pancreas  <cit> . glp <dig> is involved in regulation of mucosal epithelial integrity)  <cit> . it stimulates intestinal crypt cell proliferation  <cit>  and reduces apoptosis, therefore enhances mucosal regeneration. it has beneficial effects on many causes of intestinal injury, such as stress, vascular ischemia, nsaid administration and chemically induced injury in rodents, and decreases subsequent intestinal permeability  <cit> . the upregulation of these genes might thus be a response to the impaired intestinal barrier in fos-fed rats.

fos consistently increased intestinal permeability, but the present study showed hardly any effect on expression of well known intestinal integrity genes in the colon. most surprisingly no changes were observed in genes related to tight junctions that were expected since tight junctions are key regulators of paracellular transport. however, changes in epithelial permeability are a result of internalization of the tight-junction proteins occludin, claudin and junctional adhesion molecule-a  <cit> . these cellular translocations can occur without concomitant changes in mrna gene expression. detection of such effects would require a different approach from transcriptomics. immunohistochemistry could show whether translocation of tj proteins occurred in the fos fed rats compared with control fed rats and is under current investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
altogether we show that altered barrier integrity induced by dietary fos in rats coincides with a clear increase in colonic mitochondrial gene expression, suggesting that mitochondrial energy metabolism is important for maintaining the intestinal barrier. the role of mitochondria in maintenance of the intestinal barrier is accepted in nsaid and dnp uncoupling studies. we speculate that fos induced excess production of scfa and acidification of luminal contents might result in scfa induced atp depletion of colonic epithelial cells. insight into the role of mitochondrial function and atp depletion is of relevance, not only for the application of fos and other prebiotics in food products on the current market, but especially for mechanistic understanding of intestinal disorders where gut permeability changes are observed.
