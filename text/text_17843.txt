BACKGROUND
haemostasis  is a defense mechanism that evolved to prevent the loss of blood after injury to the transporting vessels  <cit> . the intrinsic and the extrinsic alternate pathways initiate the blood clotting process. one of the common steps in both pathways of coagulation is the activation of coagulation factor x  to factor xa .

fxa circulates in plasma as the light and the heavy chains connected by a single disulfide linkage. the n-terminal region of the light chain  is the gla domain, rich in post-translationaly modified γ-carboxyglutamic acid, which interacts with the phospholipid  membrane <cit> . the gla domain is followed by a short stack of hydrophobic residues , and two epidermal growth factor-like repeats – the egf-like  <dig> domain  and the egf-like  <dig> domain . the heavy chain of fxa contains the catalytically active serine proteinase domain . as a serine proteinase of the chymotrypsin family  <cit> , fxa consists of two subdomains of antiparallel β-barrel structure each comprising a sheet of six strands and four helices. residues his <dig>  asp <dig>  and ser <dig>  form a catalytic triad at the active site cleft between the two subdomains <cit> . the fold contains a number of solvent-exposed loops, which determine s <dig> and subsite preferences in structurally homologous enzymes of the family. to the north of the active site cleft in the canonical view are the 60- and 99-loops; to the west are the  <dig> – and the 217– <dig> loops, restricting access to the active site. the autolysis loop 149– <dig> occupies the southern boundary of the active site cleft. adjacent to it is the 70-loop. to the east is the 37-loop. loop 185– <dig> is associated with s <dig> preference <cit> . upon binding to fva in the presence of ca2+ ions on negatively charged membrane pl at the cellular surface, the prothrombinase complex is formed, resulting in the accelerated conversion of fii  to fiia  by fxa  <cit> . afterwards, thrombin converts fibrinogen into fibrin, consolidating the primary plug.

secreted phospholipases a <dig>  are water-soluble interfacial enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of the 2-acyl groups in 3-sn-phosphoglycerides. the his48/asp <dig> pair, the 26– <dig> calcium-binding loop and the 69-loop of residues 59– <dig> constitute the catalytic site. the calcium metal is a cofactor and its pocket is composed of asp <dig> and the calcium-binding loop  <cit> . the interfacial binding site  of several pla2s has been located and is species- and enzyme class-specific  <cit> . in human non-pancreatic secreted group iia phospholipase a <dig> , the ibs is located in the "front" face of the enzyme  <cit> . it consists of a highly hydrophobic surface  that surrounds the active site, and of hydrophilic residues  . two other residues  lie in the periphery of the ibs <cit> .

in addition to the esterase activities, spla2s are also specific ligands that interact with different targets, such as membrane-bound pla <dig> receptors  <cit> , anionic heparan sulfate proteoglycans  <cit> , and with a cytoskeleton protein  <cit> . on the other hand, the soluble receptors of pla2s, such as the natural inhibitors in the blood of snakes, the coagulation factors, and the pla <dig> binding protein have been also well characterized <cit> . hence, it has become clear that pla2s exert physiological and patho-physiological effects through protein-protein interaction and/or protein-pl interactions <cit> . these protein-protein mechanisms are sometimes dependent on, and other times independent of their enzymatic activity, playing important roles in determining the specific function of spla2s  <cit> . viperidae snake venoms contain several toxic group iia pla2s , which may act as presynaptic neurotoxins <cit>  and may interfere with blood coagulation by possessing strong anticoagulant properties  <cit> . viperidae svpla2s have high primary sequence identity with human group iia pla <dig>  and overall structural homology <cit> . almost all anticoagulant snake venom pla <dig> are basic proteins and may inhibit coagulation by several mechanisms. a first mechanism involves the hydrolysis and destruction of procoagulant pl  <cit> . cm-i and cm-ii, illustrate this mechanism in which the group i pla <dig> inhibits the extrinsic tenase complex  <cit> , and does not bind to fxa. a second mechanism is based on the competition with clotting proteins for binding to the lipid surface due to the high affinity of pla <dig> toward pl the "antagonist effect"  <cit>  <cit> . a third mechanism is a non-enzymatic, pl-independent mechanism in which the pla <dig> interacts with fxa, inhibits the prothrombinase complex by preventing formation of the fxa/fva complex and introduces a lag time in the generation of thrombin <cit> . in addition, some snake venom pla2s show a combination of enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms, like the basic spla <dig> isoform cm-iv from naja nigricollis  venom <cit> .

the non-enzymatic inhibition mechanism of the prothrombinase complex was first demonstrated for cm-iv <cit>  and then for hspla <dig>  <cit> . the catalytically inactive his48gln mutant of hspla <dig> possesses an identical anticoagulant effect and binds to fxa with the same kinetic constant as the wild-type enzyme, showing that in this mechanism the anticoagulant process is independent of the catalytic activity of the pla <dig>  <cit> .

kini and evans first proposed that a "pharmacological site," in addition to the catalytic site, could explain the specific biological anticoagulant activity of snake venom group i pla2s <cit> . this anticoagulant region consists of the basic exposed loop located in the region 55– <dig>  and the beginning of the β-sheet on elapidae group i pla2s  <cit> . the proposed region is positively charged in strong anticoagulant enzymes, but negatively charged in weak and non-anticoagulant enzymes  <cit> . more recently, kini proposed that weakly anticoagulant enzymes, which lack the anticoagulant region, fail to bind specifically to fxa in the coagulation cascade  <cit> .

in spite of all the studies, the corresponding site in viperidae svpla2s is not yet clearly established. in addition, no distinction is usually made between the mechanisms by which the anticoagulant potency is exerted by the pla2s. it seems that only the mechanisms that imply participation of pl have been taken into account in the past.

anticoagulant snake venom pla <dig> represent a novel family of agents useful in identifying the sites of interaction of anticoagulants at the level of specific amino acid residues and thus have a potential in identifying new drug leads  <cit> . in order to characterize the fxa-binding site of svpla <dig> from the viperidae family, we have focused on the non-enzymatic, pl-independent, anticoagulant mode of action. previous work from the unité des venins  had shown the involvement of basic residues located around the ibs of hspla <dig>  <cit> , on one hand, and the possible involvement of the c-terminal and β-wing regions of atxa <cit>  in binding to fxa, on the other. we were henceforth interested in determining whether similar or different amino acid patterns were present in viperidae svpla2s. using spr and a physiological test of inhibition of prothrombinase activity, we identified svpla2s that formed complexes with fxa and determined the apparent affinity constants of the complexes. with this experimental information at hand, we applied sequence analysis, molecular bioinformatics and docking procedures in order to define the anticoagulant region of the pla <dig> and the nature of the residues involved in the interaction with fxa.

the svpla2s tested in this study are: cbc and cba <dig>  two isoforms of the basic subunit of crotoxin , a non covalent, heterodimeric toxin from crotalus durissus terrificus formed by the basic cb and the acidic ca subunits  <cit> ; ca <dig>  an isoform of the acidic subunit of ctx <cit> ; the acidic and basic subunits of the β-neurotoxin from pseudocerastes fieldi <cit>  ; isoform a of ammodytoxin from vipera ammodytes ammodytes <cit>  ; the pla <dig> from vipera berus berus <cit>  ; myotoxin ii   <cit>  from bothrops asper <cit>  ; pla <dig> from daboia russelli pulchella  <cit>  ; the basic pla <dig> from agkistrodon halys pallas  <cit>  ; agkistrodotoxin from agkistrodon halys pallas <cit>  ; pla <dig> from crotalus atrox  <cit>  . we also tested human group iia pla <dig> <cit>  . the crystal structures of mtxii, vrv-plviii, bahp, agtx, catx and hspla <dig> are available in the pdb, whereas we structure-modeled cbc, cba <dig>  cbi, cbii, atxa and vbb.

RESULTS
identification of svpla2s that bind to fxa and inhibit prothrombinase activity
as shown in table  <dig>  the svpla2s from viperidae snake cbc and mtxii interact with fxa with very high affinity and constitute group vs . these enzymes strongly inhibit the formation of the prothrombinase complex . under identical conditions, the <kd app> value determined for hspla <dig> is  <dig> nm. cba <dig>  atxa and cbii have high affinity values and anticoagulant potency, and form group s . a third group of svpla <dig>  group m, is formed by vbb, vrv-plviii, and bahp. in this group, the affinity with fxa is smaller  and the ic <dig> ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> nm. agtx ), reported previously as weakly anticoagulant in the presence of pl <cit> , does not interact with fxa and does not inhibit prothrombinase activity in the absence of pl. neither cbi nor catx inhibit prothrombinase activity in the absence of pl. these three svpla2s constitute group nb. last, reduced and carboxymethylated cbc does not interact with fxa. furthermore, we found a positive linear correlation between <kd app> and ic <dig>  for the three groups of svpla <dig> that interact with fxa. thus, the strongly anticoagulant svpla2s bind with high affinity to fxa, whereas the less efficient anticoagulant svpla <dig> possess low affinity for fxa. also, basic svpla2s  bound to fxa and inhibited prothrombinase activity, whereas those with acidic pis  did not .

*: estimated

nb: non-binding

nd: not determined

<kdapp> = <koff>/<kon>

the ic <dig> value corresponds to 50% inhibition of thrombin generation in the absence of pl for the different svpla <dig> 

it is interesting to note that the isoenzymes cbc and cba <dig>  which differ by  <dig> amino acids  and associate with the acidic subunit ca to form two pharmacologically distinct classes of crotoxin complexes, present differences in toxicity, enzymatic activities and stability <cit> . these two isoforms bind to fxa with different kinetics . the average rate of dissociation constant <koff> for the fxa-cba <dig> complex is about two orders of magnitude greater than that of the fxa-cbc complex, implying a more stable fxa-cbc complex . consequently, cbc strongly inhibits the prothrombinase complex , whereas the inhibition by cba <dig> is much weaker . indeed, we had observed in the past that the difference in stability between crotoxin isoforms was due only to the cb subunit  <cit> .

we also investigated by spr the possibility of the formation of a ternary ca-cb-fxa complex. on one hand, ca binds to immobilized cb  <cit> , whereas fxa does not interact with immobilized cb <cit> . an anti-ca monoclonal antibody  a- <dig>   <cit>  was covalently attached to the chip, as previously described  <cit> ; ctx was then captured via this mab before the injection of fxa . fxa bound to ctx, as seen in the rise of the resonance signal. fig.  <dig> also shows that after the injection of a specific anti-cb mab , the signal increased further, indicating the presence of cb on the chip and showing that the cb-fxa complex is stable and remained attached to ca.

sequence analysis, comparisons and consensus residues of the anticoagulant svpla2s
in order to identify those residues or sequence patterns that differ between members of the svpla2s, we obtained weblogo plots of the four groups vs , s , m  and nb . thereafter, we performed comparisons of all the sequences among themselves and of the four groups against each other.

considering only segments of three or more residues, we observed three conserved regions for agtx, catx and cbi of the nb group , and six for the cbc-mtxii pair of the vs group . a striking difference between the two groups is the presence of the acidic residue glu at position  <dig> in the c-terminal region of all svpla2s of the nb group, as opposed to a lys or a gly residue in the vs group. for the other groups, only cba <dig> and vbb contain a glu at this position. with respect to the s group, the m group contains a conserved basic residue at position  <dig>  interestingly, the m group contains a conserved lys in position  <dig> that is absent in the vs and nb groups. group nb contains acidic side chains in the first strand of the β-wing and the adjacent β-turn . for the vs and s groups, the tendency is towards a net balance of positive charges in the β-wing.

the nb group catx presents three glu and one asp residue in the β-wing ; cbi presents two asp residues. the β-wing of cbc of group vs contains two lys residues; that of mtxii two lys, one asp and one glu residues. for the s and m groups the tendency is towards net positive charges, except for bahp, for which the total charge is neutral.

tertiary structures and molecular electrostatic potentials of svpla2s
we obtained 3d homology models of cbc, cba <dig>  cbi, cbii, atxa and vbb. the models show the canonical structural features of the pla <dig> template molecules: a n-terminal α-helix , a short helix , a ca2+-binding loop, a long α-helix , a loop preceding an anti-parallel two-stranded sheet , a long α-helix , anti-parallel to helix c, and a c-terminal extended fragment. all seven disulfide-bridges are at their expected positions. fig.  <dig> shows the molecular model of atxa in the canonical  face orientation, i.e., presenting the catalytic hydrophobic channel.

fig. 4a shows the mep calculated at the molecular surface of the modeled svpla2s in the canonical view. fig. 4b shows the mep on the "back" face. qualitatively, we observe that the mep is positive in the front face of strong and mild anticoagulants ; approximately neutral for the weak anticoagulant vbb, and negative for cbi . the back face is largely devoid of positive potential, except for vbb . this difference in mep leads to an electrostatic asymmetry. we observe the same trend for the crystallized svpla <dig> .

molecular docking and intermolecular interfaces: mapping of the anticoagulant site and of the binding site on fxa
the output generated by the docking program patchdock showed many complexes in contact with one of the binding site regions. only the atxa-fxa candidate complex  showed the best compatibility with the binding site derived from the mutagenesis data <cit>   is neither at the light/heavy chains interface nor at the atxa/fxa interface). several residues belonging to the two regions identified by the mutagenesis of atxa and defining part of the binding site  are at the interface in this complex. in it, the relative orientation of fxa positions the n-terminus of the egf-like  <dig> domain of the light chain of fxa towards the β-wing of atxa, allowing the 1-domain  to enter in interaction with the β-wing and thus contact the remaining residues of the front edge of the β-wing. fig.  <dig> shows the ribbon representation of the final complex between atxa and the light and heavy chains of fxa. fig.  <dig> shows the same complex in the form of a solvent-accessible surface. in both representations, the svpla <dig> is in the "classical" orientation, i.e. that of fig. 4a. overall, we observe just small conformational changes after complex formation.

for the fxa strong-binding svpla2s cbc, mtxii, cbii and cba <dig>  the complexes that ranked  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, showed the same binding mode as the atxa-fxa complex, i.e., the same relative orientation of fxa with respect to the svpla <dig>  as measured by the fit function of pymol, these complexes showed cα rmsd's with respect to the reference atxa-fxa complex of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å, respectively.

the percentage of surface residues at the interface of the complexes is of 24–36% for the five svpla2s and of 20–32% for fxa. the interface area for the five svpla2s is in the 860– <dig> Å <dig> range and 915– <dig> Å <dig> for fxa. the interface area of the complexes varies from  <dig> to  <dig> Å <dig>  the values obtained for the solvent accessible area buried in the five characterized complexes fall between the small and the large interfaces categories in a study of  <dig> protein-protein interfaces  <cit> . fig.  <dig> shows the mapping of the svpla2-fxa interaction surface of the complexes between the five svpla2s and fxa. the shadowed residues in that figure are those at the interface of the atxa-fxa complex satisfying the mutagenesis data, and at the interface of the complexes of the other four svpla2s that show the same complexation mode as the atxa-fxa complex. the consensus residues that participate to fxa binding are: solvent-exposed parts of helix a  and helix b ; positions  <dig>   <dig> and 24; a part of the ca2+ loop ; a part of the 69-loop ; and the c-terminal segment . by taking into account the type of atom-atom contacts as defined by sobolev et al. <cit> ,  <dig> % of the contacts are hydrophobic at the atxa-fxa light chain interface, as compared to  <dig> % at the atxa-fxa heavy chain interface. overall,  <dig> % of the contacts are hydrophobic at the atxa-fxa interface. these interface regions are identified separately by the protein-protein interface prediction server ppi-pred. for example, for atxa, the highest score ppi-pred patch, which represents the most probable protein-protein binding site, includes helices a and b, the ca2+-loop, part of the 69-loop, two residues from the front strand of the β-wing, and the four c-terminal residues . fig.  <dig> shows the regions mapped by docking simulations in the modeled structure of complexed atxa.

the first line of fig. 9a and 9b show the amino acid sequences of the parts of the heavy and light chains of the crystal structure of fxa , detected at the surface respectively. the heavy chain  includes the serine proteinase catalytic domain of fxa , and the light chain  includes the egf-like  <dig> domain. the following lines in fig. 9a and 9b show the fxa residues at the interface of the docked fxa-svpla <dig> complexes . the regions of fxa at the interface with cbc, mtxii, cbii, atxa and cba <dig> in the resulting docked complexes include, in the light chain , the n-terminal region of the egf-like  <dig> domain: arg86-ser <dig> and cys100-glu <dig>  gln <dig>  asn <dig>  in the heavy chain , they include the following regions. region i: arg93; phe <dig> . region ii: arg125; asp126; glu129-ser130; thr <dig>  region iii: tyr162; asp164-asn166; lys169; leu <dig>  region iv: gln <dig> and asn <dig> . region v: lys <dig>  thr <dig>  ala <dig>  phe <dig> and lys <dig> . fig.  <dig> shows these regions in the 3d model of complexed fxa. some of these residues belong to loops surrounding the catalytic-site cleft.

we show in fig. 11a and 11b the intermolecular residue contacts for the atxa-fxa interface for which the contact area is equal to or greater than  <dig> Å <dig>  we observe from this map that the heavy chain of fxa interacts with the following regions of the pla2: a portion of the ca2+ loop, the helix c-β-wing loop, and the c-terminal segment  . the light chain of fxa establishes intermolecular contacts with the remaining regions: helices a and b, and the β-wing  of atxa . from the csu analysis of interfaces, it follows that the contacts between svpla <dig> and fxa are of diverse nature -aromatic-aromatic, hydrophobic-hydrophobic, salt bridges and h-bonds. there are also destabilizing hydrophobic-hydrophilic interactions. few of the contacts take place between same-nature residues, like lys <dig> from atxa and arg <dig> from fxa's heavy chain . these contacts are between non-polar atoms or between non-polar and polar atoms of side chains at the surface of the molecules, where the presence of the aqueous solvent can buffer the electrostatic interactions.

discussion
existence of different anticoagulant mechanisms
the classification of the anticoagulant potency  of a svpla <dig> depends on the anticoagulant assay used and on whether this assay leads to establishing the mechanism of action. usually, the recalcification time assay, one of the simplest assays, is used. this method is very sensitive to the lipid levels in the plasma but does not show whether the mechanism is pl-independent or not. our results deal with the interaction of anticoagulant pla2s with fxa through the non-catalytic, pl-independent mechanism of action and are to be compared to studies performed under the same conditions. as mentioned before, only three pla2s -cm-iv of n. nigricolis, atxa of v. ammodytes ammodytes, and hspla2- have been studied under these conditions. in this work, we complete these studies by testing several other svpla <dig> from viperidae venom. our results clearly show that cbc and mtxii interact with fxa with very high affinity and strongly inhibit the formation of the prothrombinase complex. cbii, atxa and cba <dig> possess good affinity for fxa and good anticoagulant potency. vrv-plviii, bahp and vbb possess weak affinity for fxa and show weaker inhibition of prothrombinase activity. some of these enzymes  also inhibit prothrombinase activity in the presence of pl . agtx, the ca subunit of ctx, catx and cbi do not interact with fxa and do not inhibit prothrombinase activity in the absence of pl. therefore, agtx, described previously as a weakly anticoagulant pla <dig>  <cit> , and vrv-plviii, described previously as strongly anticoagulant  <cit> , appear to inhibit blood coagulation through different mechanisms.

search for an anticoagulant site
possible location of an anticoagulant site common to viperidae svpla2s that interact directly with fxa
reduced and carboxymethylated cbc did not interact with fxa , suggesting that the svpla <dig> needs to adopt the proper conformation for the interaction to take place. in agreement and in the context of the pl-independent anticoagulant mechanism, our combined theoretical and experimental approach highlights the presence of an anticoagulant region composed of amino acid residues that come together in space to constitute a conformational epitope situated in the "front" face of the svpla2s. these are the solvent-exposed parts of helix a, helix b, the ca2+ loop, the helix c-β-wing loop, the front strand of the β-wing, and the c-terminal segment of the pla <dig> . of course, the detailed distribution and composition of those residues varies for each of the svpla2s.

carredano et al. <cit>  determined the 3d structure of group ii a monomeric pla <dig> rvv-vd from vipera r. russelli , described as a strongly anticoagulant svpla <dig>  the authors proposed a site responsible for the strong anticoagulant properties of the toxin, consisting of glu <dig>  together with a positively charged ridge of non h-bonded lysine residues free for intermolecular interactions in the 53– <dig> region . on another hand, zhao et al. <cit>  suggested that residues trp <dig> and glu <dig> in bahp might play an important role in the anticoagulant activity of the basic svpla2s. the study of zhong et al. <cit> , who tested the anticoagulant potency of bahp mutants, revealed that the glu53gly and trp70met mutants lost their effects on blood clotting, while thr56lys and asp67lys had enhanced activity. the reported residues fall in the 53– <dig> interface region detected in our docked complexes of the strong fxa binders cbc, mtxii, cbii, atxa and cba <dig> . the possible contribution of trp <dig> to the strong anticoagulant activity of pla2s has also been proposed elsewhere  <cit> . nevertheless, the anticoagulant region cannot be localized solely to the 53– <dig> segment, since enzymes that bind weakly or not at all to fxa contain also basic residues in this region.

the natural mutants cbc and cba <dig> present two gly -> glu mutations in the c-terminal region  leading to increases in the ic <dig> values for inhibition of prothrombinase activity of cba <dig> with respect to cbc. this is consistent with the results of our sequence comparison analysis, in which we detect the acidic residue at position  <dig> as characteristic of the nb group, and with the docking results that point to this region as being at the interface of the complexes.

on the other hand, we localized in the crystal structure of hspla <dig>  the mutations that showed the major effects in the inhibition of prothrombinase activity and fxa-binding kinetic parameters  <cit> . residues arg <dig>  lys <dig> and lys <dig>  are exposed to the solvent and form a cluster. residue lys <dig> , and residues lys <dig> and arg <dig> form another cluster . as expected, the two clusters are situated on the front face and are oriented 180° about this convex surface. they act cooperatively in the binding to fxa. lys <dig> carries with it an effect on ic <dig>  but is in the end of the second strand of the β-wing  of hspla <dig>  indicating that its effect on ic <dig> is not due to the residue being at the interface. no effects are reported dealing with the ca2+ loop and the front strand of the β-wing does not appear in hspla <dig> ; however, to our knowledge, these regions have not yet been probed.

lastly, our experimental data suggest that the cb-fxa interaction site is different from the cb-ca interface and show that the interaction between fxa and ctx proceeds through a transient ternary  complex .

the fxa binding region of pla <dig> involves also hydrophobic residues
hspla <dig> contains an unusually large number of prominent cationic patches on its molecular surface, some of which lie on the putative ibs  <cit> , in contrast to bovine pancreatic pla <dig> and the svpla <dig> from agkistrodon p. piscivorus, which display only a limited number of such patches  <cit> . given the charged nature of the residues critical for binding hspla <dig> and atxa to fxa, it is clear that electrostatic interactions play a role in the binding. indeed, the electrostatic asymmetry showed by the mep calculations must be enhanced by the presence of the essential ca2+ cofactor ion  <cit>  and may be at the origin of the increased affinity of hspla <dig> for fxa in the presence of ca2+  <cit> . thus, long distance electrostatic forces operating at the molecular surface are important and may optimally orient the molecules before binding to fxa. however, electrostatic interactions might not exclusively drive binding to fxa by the viperidae svpla2s, as in hspla <dig>  indeed, in addition to basic residues, hydrophobic and aromatic residues play also key roles in optimizing the interaction between svpla2s and fxa, given that a ring of hydrophobic residues surrounds the opening to the catalytic site cavity. thus, for atxa, many hydrophobic residues , most of which are located in the n-terminal region, and several aromatic residues  are part of the surface presented to fxa . lastly, even though a phe24ala mutation in atxa was not found to change the fxa-binding kinetic parameters  <cit> , we emphasize the need to probe other residues belonging to the hydrophobic ring.

the pla <dig> binding region of fxa involves both, the light and heavy chains but not the catalytic site
on our results, the catalytic site of fxa is free and not involved in the interface, in agreement with the conservation of the serine-proteinase catalytic activity after binding by svpla <dig>  <cit> . our atxa-fxa complex shows that one region of the light chain of fxa is involved in the binding to the svpla <dig> and that the n-terminus of the egf-like 2-domain is pointing south . therefore, the egf-like 1-domain, not visible in the crystal structure of fxa, can interact with the front edge of the β-wing of the pla <dig>  the gla domain of fxa , is well beyond reach in space and not in contact with the pla <dig>  these two features are in agreement with experimental and biochemical data which support the conclusion that the gla domain is needed rather for insertion into the pl membrane  <cit> , and with a model of the entire fxa. indeed, based on the crystal structure of the gla domain of bovine prothrombin and the nmr coordinates of the bovine fx egf <dig> domain, bajaj and coworkers  <cit>  proposed a model structure for the entire fxa molecule, based upon the crystal structure of porcine fixa. the egf domains in the model are oriented south and thus capable of establishing contacts with the β-wing of the pla <dig> 

based on the ability of synthetic peptides from fxa to inhibit fxa-induced clotting, a number of authors have reported the fva binding sites on fxa. the last line of fig. 9a shows the experimentally reported residues of the heavy chain of fxa incontrovertibly involved in the binding to fva. these residues are: fxa  <cit> ; fxa  <cit> ; the 185– <dig> loop, i.e., fxa  <cit> ; fxa  <cit> ; and fxa  <cit> . three of four of the segments of the catalytic domain of fxa identified to interact with fva overlap with those identified by us to interact with the viperidae svpla2s, namely the segment about lys <dig>  the 162-loop, and the c-terminal part, about lys <dig> . this suggests that several residues are shared by both, the svpla2-fxa and the fva-fxa binding interfaces. moreover, the experimentally identified fxa heavy chain residues involved in binding to fva are located on the same 3d face of fxa, as in our svpla2-fxa complexes.

arni and coworkers have recently reported the crystal structures of human gla domainless fxa complexed with two small anticoagulant proteins from a hematophagous nematode  <cit> . the determined exosite from those complexes involves residues from one of the strands of the n-terminal seven-stranded β-barrel  and from the short c-terminal α-helix  of the catalytic subunit of fxa. several of these residues fall in regions i and v mapped in our complexes with the svpla2s .

several ibs residues are part of the pl-independent anticoagulant site of svpla2
by combining the residues defining the ibs  <cit>  with the site-directed mutagenesis experiments for probing the basic residues of hspla <dig> involved in binding to fxa <cit> , we deduce that ibs residues arg <dig> and lys <dig> bind to fxa.

by homology with hspla <dig>  the presumed ibs amino acid residues for atxa are leu <dig>  leu <dig>  phe <dig>  lys <dig> and tyr <dig>  on one hand, lys <dig>  experimentally found to be critical for binding of atxa to fxa  <cit> , belongs to the ibs. on the other hand, our simulations indicate that ibs residues leu <dig>  leu <dig> and phe <dig> are in contact with fxa. in conclusion, several ibs residues are part of the pl-independent anticoagulant site and participate in formation of the complex with fxa.

svpla <dig> are multifunctional proteins with multiple pharmacological sites
the viperidae svpla2s studied here are multifunctional proteins, raising the possibility of overlapping or multiple pharmacological sites distinct from the catalytic site <cit> . one team <cit>  has suggested that the neurotoxic site of group ii neurotoxic enzymes overlaps with the anticoagulant region. thus, from the mutants used to test the anticoagulant potency  <cit>  and the neurotoxic function  <cit>  of atxa, it appears that several residues in the c-terminus are clearly shared by both functions. the overlapping of pharmacological sites is most easily understood in terms of the small size of this family of proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we concentrated our efforts on identifying the anticoagulant viperidae svpla2s that inhibit blood coagulation via a non-enzymatic, pl-independent mechanism through direct binding to human fxa. using spr technology, we showed that cbc and mtxii bind to fxa with the highest affinity and inhibit strongly the prothrombinase complex, whereas cbii, atxa and cba <dig> bind with good, but lesser affinity.

of the eight mutations that differentiate cbc from cba <dig>  arg34gln in the ca2+ loop and gly128glu in the c-terminal segment fall in our identified interface regions; gly116glu is just borderline to the c-terminal fragment. thus, the disappearance of a positive charge and the appearance of two negative charges in this region account for the loss of affinity of cba <dig> for fxa with respect to cbc. this is consistent with our consensus sequence analysis, which had associated the presence of glu at position  <dig> to a decrease in affinity.

the molecular electrostatic potential we calculate at the surface of the 3d molecular models shows a correlation with the anticoagulant potency of the svpla2s. however, since not all basic pla <dig> are strong anticoagulants  <cit> , the basic character of the pla <dig> seems to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for its anticoagulant potency.

mapping of the fxa-interface zone in the 3d structures of the svpla2s by binding-site directed docking simulations, allowed us to detect several fxa-binding regions that come together to form a conformational epitope on the "front" surface of the svpla2s. one of the regions maps to the 53– <dig> segment, proposed in the past to be the anticoagulant region. according to our findings, this region is to be extended, on one hand, to helices a and b and to the "front" strand of the β-wing, and to the ca2+ loop and the c-terminal direction, on the other. the fxa interface forms a novel exosite that involves both, the light and heavy chains.

our work epitomizes the use of binding affinity and mutational experimental data in guiding molecular docking simulations by indicating which species associate and then outlining the possible interacting surface patches.

finally, there has been intense interest in the development of fxa inhibitors for the treatment of thrombotic diseases. anticoagulant viperidae svpla2s, which interact with fxa via a non-catalytic, pl-independent mechanism, represent a novel family of selective fxa inhibitors. structural information on the binding of these pla <dig> to fxa should be useful in the 3d structure-based design of therapeutic agents. the synthesis of peptides or peptidomimetics derived from our mapped regions could lead to the development of new antithrombotic molecules capable of delaying in vivo the activation stage of the prothrombinase complex and to their use as supplementary agents in antithrombotic therapy.
