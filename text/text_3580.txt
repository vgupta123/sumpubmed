BACKGROUND
transcription factors and cofactors orchestrate complex yet precise programs of gene expression that are critical for cell proliferation and differentiation during development. the myocyte enhancer factor  <dig>  family of transcription factors regulates diverse cellular processes in a wide range of cell types  <cit> . in muscle cells, the mef <dig> family of proteins binds to the promoters of many muscle-specific genes and activates their transcription during muscle differentiation  <cit> . there are four mef <dig> proteins, mef2a, -b, -c, and -d, in vertebrates  <cit> . they contain a mads box and an adjacent mef <dig> motif at their n-termini that mediate dna binding, homo- and hetero-dimerization, and cofactor binding  <cit> . they also contain a transcriptional activation domain at their c-termini  <cit> . homozygous mef2c null mice are embryonic lethal due to defective cardiac myogenesis and morphogenesis  <cit>  whereas mef2a null mice die suddenly shortly after birth due to defects in post-natal cardiomyocytes  <cit> . therefore, among other functions, mef <dig> proteins play essential and distinct roles during cardiac muscle development. in addition, mutations of human mef2a have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a familial coronary artery disease  <cit> .

the functions of mef <dig> proteins are regulated by their direct physical interactions with a large collection of cofactors, including thyroid hormone receptor, myod, nfat, gata, p <dig>  grip <dig>  histone deacetylases , and mitr  <cit> . the class ii hdacs  contain a characteristic mef2-interacting domain at their n-termini  <cit>  and an hdac catalytic domain at their c-termini. they bind to the mads/mef <dig> domain of mef <dig> proteins and repress their transcriptional activity  <cit> . in addition to cofactor binding, mef <dig> proteins are also regulated by multiple phosphorylation events  <cit> . several kinases, including p <dig> map kinase, erk <dig>  and cdk <dig>  can phosphorylate mef <dig> proteins and regulate their transcriptional activity  <cit> . phosphorylation of mef <dig> by p <dig> occurs in the transcriptional activation domain of mef <dig> and stimulates its transcriptional activity  <cit> . recently, it has been shown that an alternative splicing event within the last coding exon of mef2c leads to the formation of two mef2c isoforms, only one of which contains a 32-residue domain called γ  <cit> . the mef2c- isoform has higher transcriptional activity than does mef2c-, and a gal4-γ-domain fusion protein represses the basal level transcription of a promoter with gal4-binding sites  <cit> . interestingly, ser  <dig> within the γ-domain is phosphorylated and the s396a mutation diminishes the transcriptional repression activity of the γ-domain  <cit> . these results suggest that the γ-domain might recruit transcriptional repressors in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. because a motif similar to the γ-domain is constitutively present in mef2a, -b, and -d, phosphorylation within this motif might negatively regulate the transcriptional activities of other mef <dig> proteins.

small ubiquitin-like modifier  is structurally related to ubiquitin and is covalently conjugated to lysine residues of target proteins through an amide bond  <cit> . there are at least three mammalian sumo proteins, sumo <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  sumo <dig> and - <dig> share greater than 90% sequence identity while both are about 50% identical to sumo <dig>  <cit> . sumoylation is catalyzed by a set of enzymes, including e1-activating enzyme , e2-conjugating enzyme , and e <dig> ligases  <cit> . three types of sumo e <dig> ligases, ranbp <dig>  the pias proteins, and pc <dig>  have been identified  <cit> . they exhibit different subcellular localization patterns and might enhance sumoylation of specific subsets of sumo substrates in vivo  <cit> . like ubiquitination, sumoylation is a dynamic process and is actively reversed by sumo-specific proteases, including senp <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  <cit> . unlike ubiquitination, sumoylation does not generally lead to degradation of target proteins  <cit> . instead, sumoylation regulates the functions of substrate proteins in multiple ways, including controlling their subcellular localization, affecting their interactions with other proteins, or increasing their stability through antagonizing ubiquitination  <cit> . many transcriptional factors and cofactors are sumoylated and, in most cases, sumoylation inhibits their transcriptional activity  <cit> . sumoylation of elk- <dig> and p <dig> enhances their binding to hdac <dig> and - <dig>  respectively, suggesting that sumoylation might repress transcription through recruitment of transcriptional repressors, such as hdacs  <cit> . however, it remains to be established whether hdac recruitment is a general mechanism for transcriptional repression by sumoylation.

we have previously identified human mef <dig> proteins as sumo <dig> substrates using an in vitro expression cloning  strategy  <cit> . in addition, mef2c and mef2d have very recently been shown to be modified by sumo <dig> and sumo <dig>  <cit> . sumoylation of mef <dig> is enhanced by class iia hdacs and by sirt1-mediated deacetylation of the lysine acceptor for sumo  <cit> . here we further confirm the sumoylation of mef2c in vivo and identify k <dig> as the major sumoylation site of mef2c. as compared to the wild-type mef2c, the mef2c-k391r mutant has higher transcriptional activity in reporter assays, and is more efficient in promoting the conversion of 10t1/ <dig> cells into myocytes when co-expressed with myod. these findings suggest that sumoylation of mef2c inhibits its transcriptional activity. sumoylation of mef2c does not appear to affect its binding to dna, its interactions with hdacs, or its phosphorylation by p <dig>  interestingly, k <dig> is located in the γ-domain and in close proximity to s <dig>  which can be phosphorylated by unknown kinase  <cit> . when fused to gal <dig>  a c-terminal fragment of mef2c containing the γ-domain is sufficient to repress transcription of a promoter that contained gal4-binding sites. mutations of either k <dig> or s <dig> abolish the transcriptional repression activity of the gal4-mef2c fusion protein. moreover, phosphorylation of s <dig> enhances the sumoylation of the c-terminal domain of mef2c in vitro. the s396a mutation reduces the degree of mef2c sumoylation in vivo. we propose that phosphorylation of s <dig> facilitates the sumoylation of mef2c, which in turn recruits yet unidentified transcriptional repressors to inhibit transcription.

RESULTS
mef2c is sumoylated at k <dig> in vivo
we and gregoire et al. had previously shown that the mef <dig> family of transcription factors was efficiently sumoylated  <cit> . as shown in figure 1a, mef2c was modified in the presence of e <dig> , e <dig> , and sumo <dig>  his6-sumo <dig> resulted in a further shift in gel mobility as compared to untagged sumo <dig> . the yeast sumo isopeptidase, ulp <dig>  efficiently reversed this modification . mef2c contains a sumoylation motif, Φkxe   <cit>  in the γ-domain of mef2c  <cit>  that is highly conserved among other members of the mef <dig> family . we mutated the lysine residue in this motif  to arginine and observed the mef2c-k391r is no longer sumoylated in vitro . we then examined the sumoylation of mef2c in hela and nih3t <dig> cells . a significant fraction of myc-mef2c, but not myc-mef2c-k391r, was converted to a slow-migrating species when it was co-expressed with gfp-sumo <dig> . we then immunoprecipitated myc-mef2c and blotted the immunoprecipitates with anti-gfp. the slower migrating band contained gfp-sumo <dig> . furthermore, we observed that overexpression of sumo isopeptidase, senp <dig>  or a dominant-negative mutant of ubc <dig>  greatly reduced the intensity of this slow-migrating band of myc-mef2c . co-expression of the pias family of e <dig> ligases, piasxβ, enhanced the sumoylation of myc-mef2c-wt , but not that of myc-mef2c-k391r. these data indicate that mef2c is sumoylated in vivo and k <dig> is the major sumoylation site of mef2c in living cells.

sumoylation of mef2c reduces its transcriptional activity
we next used a luciferase reporter assay to examine whether sumoylation of mef2c regulates its transcriptional activity. the luciferase reporter construct contained three tandem copies of mef2-binding sites at the promoter region. the transcriptional activity of mef2c-k391r  was about two-fold higher than that of the wild-type mef2c , suggesting that sumoylation of mef2c inhibits its transcription activity. overexpression of gfp-sumo <dig> downregulates the transcription activity of both mef2c-wt and k391r . because overexpression of gfp-sumo <dig> caused a global increase in the sumoylation of many cellular proteins , inhibition of mef2c-k391r by gfp-sumo <dig> overexpression was most likely due to the enhanced sumoylation of other mef2c regulatory proteins under these conditions. however, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that mef2c is sumoylated at a second site, the sumoylation of which is below the detection limit of our assay.

we next examined whether sumoylation affected the activation of endogenous mef2c by the p38mapk pathway. to do so, we transfected a constitutively active mutant of mkk <dig>  into c2c <dig> cell lines, together with gfp-sumo <dig> or senp <dig>  overexpression of gfp-sumo <dig> reduced the transcriptional activity of mef2c whereas overexpression of senp <dig> enhanced the activity of mef2c in the presence of constitutively active mkk <dig> . these results are consistent with the notion that sumoylation of mef2c inhibits the transcription activity of the endogenous mef2c stimulated by the p38mapk pathway. however, it is entirely possible that alteration of the sumoylation levels of other mef2c regulatory proteins is responsible for the observed effects of gfp-sumo and senp <dig> 

embryonic fibroblast cells can be converted into myoblasts upon overexpression of myod and mef <dig>  <cit> . we tested whether mef2c-k391r was more active than mef2c-wt in collaborating with myod to promote the conversion of 10t1/ <dig> cells into myoblasts. we transfected myod- and mef2c-expressing plasmids into 10t1/ <dig> cells and cultured these cells in low-serum media to induce the differentiation of the converted myoblasts into myotubes. on the fifth day after the induction of differentiation, the cells were fixed and stained with an antibody against myosin heavy chain , a well-established myogenic differentiation marker . co-expression of mef2c-wt together with myod slightly increased the number of myotubes, as compared to the expression of myod alone . co-expression of mef2c-k391r with myod increased the myoblast conversion rate by two-fold  . the expression levels of mef2c-wt and mef2c-k391r were similar . these results suggest that sumoylation of mef2c down-regulates its transcriptional activity during muscle differentiation.

sumoylation of mef2c recruits transcriptional repressors other than class ii hdacs
we next sought to determine the mechanism by which sumoylation inhibits the transcriptional activity of mef2c. we first tested whether sumoylation reduced the dna-binding activity of mef2c using the chromatin immunoprecipitation  assay. similar amounts of mef2c-wt or mef2c-k391r bound to the desmin promoter in a reporter plasmid , suggesting that sumoylation does not affect the dna-binding activity of mef2c. we next tested whether sumoylation of mef2c increases its binding to hdacs, such as hdac <dig> and hdac <dig>  mef2c-wt and mef2c-k391r bound equally well to hdac <dig> or hdac <dig> , suggesting that sumoylation of mef2c does not recruit class ii hdacs.

since sumoylation inhibits the activation of the endogenous mef2c by the p38mapk pathway , we thus tested whether sumoylation and p <dig> phosphorylation of mef2c are antagonistic. however, we observed that sumoylation does not affect the binding affinity of mef2c toward p <dig> or phosphorylation of mef2c by p <dig> . likewise, phosphorylation of mef2c by p <dig> does not appear to block sumoylation of mef2c in vivo . thus, there is no significant interplay between sumoylation and p <dig> phosphorylation of mef2c.

to further study how sumoylation reduced the transcriptional activity of mef2c, we measured the transcriptional activity of gal <dig> fusion proteins of mef2c and mef2c-k391r, using luciferase reporter assays with a reporter construct that contained gal4-binding sites. as compared to gal4-mef2c-wt, gal4-mef2c-k391r was much more active in stimulating transcription . overexpression of dn-ubc <dig> or senp <dig> greatly increased the transcriptional activity of gal4-mef2c-wt, but not gal4-mef2c-k391r . these data indicate that sumoylation also inhibits the transcriptional activity of mef2c at a promoter that does not contain mef2c-binding sites, consistent with the fact that sumoylation does not affect the dna-binding activity of mef2c.

we next performed luciferase reporter assays with a reporter construct that contained both gal4- and lexa-binding sites. lexa-vp <dig>  dramatically stimulated the transcription of this reporter gene . co-expression of gal4-mef2c-wt, but not gal4-mef2c-k391r, greatly reduced the transcriptional activity of lexa-vp <dig> . this suggests that gal4-mef2c might recruit transcriptional repressors to this artificial promoter in a manner that is dependent on its sumoylation.

since sumoylation of mef2c does not appear to affect its binding to hdac <dig> and hdac <dig>  recruitment of these hdacs is unlikely to be responsible for the transcriptional repression activity of gal4-mef2c. to further test this notion, we constructed gal4-fusion proteins of two c-terminal mef2c fragments, termed Δn <dig> and Δn <dig>  and their corresponding k391r mutants, and tested their abilities to stimulate/repress transcription in reporter assays . mef2c-Δn <dig> lacked the n-terminal mads/mef <dig> domain that is required for hdac-binding whereas Δn <dig> lacked both the mads/mef <dig> domain and the transactivation domain . as shown in figure 4b, gal4-mef2c-Δn1-k391r was much more active in promoting transcription of the reporter gene that contained gal4-binding sites at its promoter, suggesting that mef2c-Δn <dig> retained the ability to be regulated by sumo. furthermore, gal4-mef2c-Δn <dig>  but not gal4-mef2c-Δn2-k391r repressed the activity of lexa-vp <dig> to stimulate transcription of the reporter gene whose promoter contained both gal4- and lexa-binding sites . expectedly, both gal4-mef2c-Δn <dig> and gal4-mef2c-Δn <dig> were sumoylated in hela cells when co-expressed with gfp-sumo <dig> . since mef2c-Δn <dig> and mef2c-Δn <dig> lack the hdac-binding domain of mef2c, these data suggest that sumoylation of mef2c might mediate the recruitment of transcriptional repressors other than class ii hdacs to repress the transcriptional activities of gal4-mef2c or lexa-vp <dig>  in addition, mef2c-Δn <dig> lacks the p <dig> phosphorylation sites and yet retains the ability to be regulated by sumoylation. this is consistent with the notion that sumoylation does not repress the transcriptional activity of mef2c through reducing p <dig> phosphorylation of mef2c.

phosphorylation of s <dig> facilitates sumoylation of mef2c
recently, s <dig>  a conserved serine residue in the c-terminal γ-domain of mef2c, has been shown to be phosphorylated  <cit> . mef2c-s396a or a mef2c splicing variant that lacks the γ-domain is much more active in transcriptional reporter assays  <cit> . moreover, γ-domain alone when fused to gal <dig> can repress the basal transcriptional activity of gal <dig>  and this repression is diminished by the s396a mutation  <cit> . these findings indicate that phosphorylation of s <dig> inhibits the transcriptional activity of mef <dig> proteins by recruiting transcriptional repressors. interestingly, the major sumoylation site of mef2c, k <dig>  is located in the vicinity of s <dig> .

we therefore tested whether phosphorylation of s <dig> affected the sumoylation of mef2c. we envisioned three possible scenarios  with respect to the relationship between phosphorylation of s <dig> and sumoylation at k <dig> . in model a, phosphorylation and sumoylation are independent of each other. in this case, mutations of k391r and s396a are expected to have additive or synergistic effects in reporter assays. in models b and c, sumoylation of k <dig> is dependent on phosphorylation of s <dig>  or vice versa. gal4-mef2c-k391r activated the transcription of a reporter gene that contained gal4-binding sites much more efficiently than did gal4-mef2c-wt . the gal4-mef2c-k391r,s396a double mutant did not exhibit higher transcriptional activity than did gal4-mef2c-k391r . similarly, both gal4-mef2c-Δn2-k391r and gal4-mef2c-Δn2-k391r,s396a completely lost the ability to repress the transcriptional activity of lexa-vp <dig> toward a reporter gene that contained both gal4- and lexa-binding sites . these data are consistent with the notion that phosphorylation of s <dig> and sumoylation of k <dig> act through the same pathway to repress transcription, and model a is unlikely to be correct. furthermore, gal4-mef2c-s396a was less active in promoting transcription than gal4-mef2c-k391r . similarly, gal4-mef2c-Δn2-s396a still retained partial activity in repressing the transcriptional activity of lexa-vp <dig> . although mef2c-s396e  was slightly more active than the mef2c-wt for unknown reasons , it was much less active than the s396a mutant . while we cannot rule out model c, our data are more consistent with model b, in that sumoylation of mef2c is the key event in inhibiting its transcriptional activity and phosphorylation of s <dig> might facilitate the sumoylation of mef2c at k <dig> 

to directly test this hypothesis, we expressed and purified gst-mef2c-Δn <dig> and the corresponding s396a and s396e mutants from e. coli and examined their phosphorylation by cdk1/cyclin b <dig>  cdk1/cyclin b <dig> phosphorylated gst-mef2c-Δn2-wt to a greater extent than the mef2c-Δn2-s396a mutant , suggesting that cdk1/cyclin b <dig> can phosphorylate mef2c at s <dig>  we then examined the sumoylation of recombinant gst-mef2c-Δn2-wt, s396a, and s396e proteins in vitro. as shown in figure 6b, at high concentrations of sumo reaction components and these substrate proteins, all three gst-mef2c-Δn <dig> proteins were efficiently sumoylated in vitro. the s396e mutant was slightly more efficiently sumoylated . we next tested whether phosphorylation of mef2c-Δn <dig> by cdk <dig> affected its sumoylation. because sumoylation of the s396a mutant was already very efficiently sumoylated at high concentrations of sumo enzymes, we performed the sumo reactions with much lower concentrations of sumo reaction components and substrates. under these conditions, addition of cdk1/cyclin b <dig> enhanced the sumoylation of gst-mef2c-Δn2-wt, but not the s396a mutant . furthermore, the s396e mutant was more efficiently sumoylated than wt or s396a proteins in the absence of cdk1/cyclin b <dig>  and was not further enhanced by cdk1/cyclin b <dig> . these results suggest that phosphorylation of s <dig> facilitates the sumoylation of mef2c-Δn <dig> in vitro.

we note that the s396a mutation and the k391r/s396a double mutation in the context of the full-length mef2c appeared to abrogate the transcriptional repression activity of gal4-mef2c to similar extents . on the other hand, the k391r/s396a double mutation in the context of Δn2-mef2c had a significantly larger effect than the s396a mutation in diminishing the transcriptional repression activity of gal4-Δn2-mef2c . the underlying reasons for this difference is unclear at present. an intriguing possibility is that, as compared to the full-length mef2c, sumoylation of Δn2-mef2c might be less dependent on prior phosphorylation at s <dig>  indeed, at later timepoints, Δn2-mef2c-s396a was as efficiently sumoylated as Δn2-mef2c in vitro . unfortunately, the full-length mef2c did not express well in bacteria, which prohibited us from testing its sumoylation in vitro.

we next compared the sumoylation of mef2c-wt, mef2c-s396a, and mef2c-s396e in 10t1/ <dig> cells in the presence of gfp-sumo <dig> overexpression . consistent with the in vitro sumoylation assay, mef2c-s396a was again less efficiently sumoylated than mef2c-wt and mef2c-s396e . therefore, these results suggest that sumoylation of mef2c at k <dig> is facilitated by phosphorylation of s <dig> in vivo.

discussion
many transcription factors and cofactors can be covalently modified by sumo  <cit> . sumoylation of these factors generally leads to transcriptional repression. sumoylation of elk- <dig> and p <dig> facilitates the recruitment of hdac <dig>  and - <dig>  respectively, suggesting that sumoylation might repress transcription through the recruitment of hdacs to promoters  <cit> . in addition to hdacs, daxx was shown to be another co-repressor that contributes to sumo-mediated repression of transcription  <cit> .

in this study, we show that mef2c is sumoylated in vitro and in vivo, and sumoylation inhibits its transcriptional activity. sumoylation of mef2c does not appear to affect its dna-binding, hdac-recruitment, nuclear localization  <cit> , stability , or p <dig> phosphorylation, suggesting that sumoylation does not repress the transcriptional activity of mef2c through these mechanisms. moreover, when fused to gal <dig>  mef2c-Δn <dig> that cannot bind to class ii hdacs and other transcriptional repressors, including cabin <dig>  <cit>  and mitr  <cit> , is sufficient to repress the ability of lexa-vp <dig> to activate transcription from a promoter containing both gal4- and lexa-binding sites. the k391r mutation abolishes the transcriptional repression activity of gal4-mef2c-Δn <dig>  suggesting that sumoylation of mef2c-Δn <dig> recruits transcriptional repressors other than class ii hdacs. class i hdacs does not seem to be the repressor recruited after sumoylation since overexpression of class i hdacs failed to repress the transcriptional activity of mef2c in reporter assays . therefore, sumoylation of mef2c appears to repress its transcriptional activity through a novel mechanism.

regulation of the transcriptional activity of mef2
transcription activity of myogenic bhlh and mef <dig> proteins is tightly regulated during muscle differentiation. multiple pathways exist to ensure the repression of these transcription factors in dividing myoblasts  <cit> . for example, cdk4/cyclin d represses the activity of mef <dig> proteins through blocking their interactions with the grip <dig> co-activator  <cit> , although it is unclear whether cdk4/cyclin d phosphorylates mef <dig> proteins directly. in addition, another cyclin-dependent kinase, cdk <dig>  phosphorylates mef <dig> proteins and inhibits their transcriptional activity in neurons  <cit> .

consistent with recent findings by gregoire and yang  <cit> , we observed that sumoylation-deficient mef2c has higher myogenic activity than wild-type , suggesting that sumoylation might be another important mechanism to actively repress the transcriptional activity of mef <dig> proteins in dividing myocytes. surprisingly, only a very small population of mef2c is modified by sumo in c2c <dig> cells . it is unclear how sumoylation of this small population of mef2c effectively suppresses the activity of cellular mef2c. on the other hand, this appears to be a recurring theme in the sumoylation of transcriptional factors. one intriguing possibility is that transient sumoylation of these transcriptional factors recruits transcriptional repressors that covalently modify the chromatin at the transcriptional loci, which in turn establishes a relatively long-lived chromatin state that is not permissible for transcription. alternatively, a "molecular memory" model has been proposed to explain this phenomenon. in this model, a protein molecule that has experienced a sumoylation/desumoylation cycle is proposed to be functionally distinct from one that has never experienced sumoylation  <cit> .

regulation of sumoylation of mef <dig> by phosphorylation
we have shown that sumoylation of mef2c appears to be facilitated by phosphorlyation of s <dig>  since s396a mutant is not as efficiently sumoylated in vivo and in vitro as compared to the wild-type mef2c. phosphorylation by cdk1/cyclin b <dig> enhances the sumoylation of mef2c-Δn <dig>  but not that of mef2c-Δn2-s396a. surprisingly, though the phospho-mimicking mef2c-Δn2-s396e mutant was more efficiently sumoylated than the wild-type in vitro, mef2c-s396e was less efficiently sumoylated than the wild-type in vivo. consistently, mef2c-s396e was slightly more active than the wild-type in transcriptional assays. the reason for this discrepancy is unclear at present. one possibility is that phosphorylated and sumoylated mef2c is a better substrate for sumo isopeptidases in vivo. phosphorylation at s <dig> of the wild-type mef2c can be reversed by phosphatases, resulting in longer half-life of sumoylated mef2c. in contrast, the s396e mutant would be refractory to the actions of phosphatases. even though mef2c-s396e can be more efficiently sumoylated as compared to the wild-type, it might be also more prone to desumoylation of sumo isopeptidases, resulting to its lower steady state of sumoylation in vivo.

the kinase that mediates the phosphorylation of s <dig> in vivo is currently unknown. because s <dig> is followed by a proline, the s <dig> kinase is likely to belong to families of proline-directed kinases, such as cyclin-dependent kinases and map kinases. though cdk1/cyclin b <dig> is capable of phosphorylating mef2c at s <dig> in vitro, we do not think that it is the relevant kinase that phosphorylates mef2c at this site in vivo. cdk <dig> was shown to phosphorylate mef2d at this site in neurons  <cit> . however, the activity of cdk <dig> is strictly dependent on its p35/p <dig> cofactor that is exclusively expressed in neurons  <cit> . furthermore, we did not observe in vitro phosphorylation of mef2c-Δn <dig> by cdk <dig> alone . thus, yet unidentified kinase mediate phosphorylation of mef2c at s <dig> and consequently sumoylation of mef2c at k <dig> during muscle differentiation.

there are precedents for phosphorylation-dependent sumoylation. phosphorylation of hsf <dig> and pparγ has recently been shown to facilitate their sumoylation  <cit> . intriguingly, similar to mef2c, the phosphorylation sites on hsf <dig> and pparγ are both followed by a proline . in all three cases, the sumoylation and phosphorylation sites are separated by four residues . phosphorylation at + <dig> position by a proline-directed kinase is expected to introduce negative charges at this position, which may enhance the binding affinity between ubc <dig> and the sumoylation motif. an inspection of the known sumoylation sites reveals that a sumoylation site of c-myb is also followed by an sp motif at the + <dig> and + <dig> positions, suggesting that sumoylation of c-myb at this site might also be regulated by phosphorylation  <cit> . in addition, several known sumoylation sites contain an acidic residue  at the + <dig> position . these extended sumoylation consensus motifs that contain acidic residues at + <dig> position might be more efficiently sumoylated.

CONCLUSIONS
the mef <dig> family of transcriptional factors regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of many cell types. the activities of mef <dig> proteins are themselves regulated by multiple mechanisms, including sumoylation. we have discovered that phosphorylation of a serine residue in the vicinity of the sumoylation site facilitates sumoylation of mef2c. this finding also allows us to define extended sumoylation consensus motifs that contain sp at +5/+ <dig> positions or an acidic residue at + <dig> position.
