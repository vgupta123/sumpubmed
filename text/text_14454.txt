BACKGROUND
bone morphogenic proteins  are members of the transforming growth factor beta  superfamily that consists of a number of structurally related polypeptides that control a broad array of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation  <cit> . although bmps originally were identified as proteins that induced formation of bone when implanted into the muscle of adult rats  <cit> , bmps also play crucial roles in dorsoventral patterning of the mesoderm, neural patterning, skeletal development, and limb formation  <cit> . altered bmp signaling pathways are associated with several human diseases including arthritis, osteoporosis, kidney diseases, cancer and pulmonary hypertension  <cit> .

bmps are synthesized as precursor proteins. after dimerization, the precursor molecules are proteolytically cleaved within the cell by proprotein convertases at the multibasic motif rxxr to yield the active, carboxy-terminal mature protein dimer  <cit> . bmps exert their biological activity through combinations of type i and type ii serine/threonine kinase receptors. three distinct bmp type i receptors, i.e. activin receptor-like kinase - <dig>  alk <dig>  and alk <dig>  and three distinct type ii receptors, i.e. bmp type ii receptor  and two activin type ii receptors  have been identified  <cit> . upon ligand binding, the type ii receptors phosphorylate the type i receptor, which in turn initiates the downstream signaling process through phosphorylation of bmp-specific receptor-regulated smads , i.e. smad <dig>  smad <dig> or smad <dig>  <cit> . r-smads form a complex with smad <dig> and translocate into the nucleus where the complex regulates the transcription of various target genes through its association with other transcription factors  <cit> . in contrast, tgf-β and activin signaling pathways recruit smad <dig> and smad <dig>  which can also form heteromeric complexes with smad <dig> 

in addition to the tissue-specific expression of bmps and their surface receptors, the biological activity of bmps is regulated by a number of extracellular inhibitory molecules, such as chordin, noggin and follistatin  <cit> . moreover, bmp signaling can be modulated by cross-talk with other pathways. tgf-β and bmp can modulate the activity of each other through competition for the interaction of their respective r-smad with smad <dig> or through activation of inhibitor smads   <cit> .

the biological effects of bmps have been used to develop quantitative bioassays. to date, alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker of osteoblast differentiation, measured in mesenchymal cells upon bmp stimulation, is the in-vitro assay most widely used among the research community to evaluate bmp activity  <cit> . however, the response in this assay is slow, usually taking between two to five days, and the assay is not sensitive enough to measure the low bmp concentrations generated in many biological systems.

here we describe the development of a rapid and highly sensitive cell-based assay to measure bmp activities in different biological contexts. c2c <dig> mouse mesenchymal cells and hepg <dig> human hepatoma cells were stably transfected with a construct consisting of a bmp/smad-dependent specific enhancer derived from the id <dig> promoter and fused to a luciferase reporter gene  <cit> . through screening and cloning, we generated two stable cell lines, c2c12bra and hepg2bra, which can measure bmp activity with high sensitivity and in various biological situations.

RESULTS
expression of bmp and bmprs in the hepg2bra and c2c12bra
c2c <dig> mouse myoblast and hepg <dig> human hepatoma cell lines, which are known to respond to bmps, were stably transfected with the bre-luc construct. this construct contains regions of the mouse id <dig> promoter, which are important for the induction of id <dig> transcription by bmps, fused to a luciferase reporter gene. after cloning the transfected c2c <dig> and hepg <dig> colonies, cells from c2c <dig> clone  <dig>  and hepg <dig> clone  <dig>  were found to be the most sensitive upon stimulation with recombinant bmp- <dig> . these clones were used for all subsequent experiments.

to obtain a comprehensive picture of the repertoire of bmps and bmprs expressed by c2c12bra and hepg2bra cells, we analyzed the expression of mrnas coding for bmps and bmprs. total rna was isolated from c2c12bra and hepg2bra cells and subjected to rt-pcr. hepg2bra cells expressed the mrna for bmp- <dig> . no pcr products were observed for bmp- <dig>  bmp- <dig> and bmp- <dig>  we next analyzed the expression of mrna coding for the three type i receptors  and the three type ii receptors . c2c12bra cells express alk <dig>  bmprii and actr-iia mrna . trace levels of alk <dig> and actr-iib were detected, whereas no expression of alk <dig> was observed. hepg2bra cells express alk <dig>  bmprii and actr-iib mrna. trace levels of alk <dig> were detected, whereas no pcr products were obtained for alk <dig> and actr-iia .

dose-dependent induction of the bre-luc contruct by bmps
hepg2bra and c2c12bra cells were assayed for the induction of luciferase expression using a broad range of bmp- <dig>  bmp- <dig>  bmp- <dig> and bmp- <dig> concentrations . hepg2bra and c2c12bra cells demonstrated equivalent dose-responses when stimulated with bmp- <dig>   and bmp- <dig> , but a different dose-response curve for bmp- <dig> and bmp- <dig> . bmp- <dig> was the most potent inducer of luciferase activity with an ed <dig> of approximately  <dig> pm and  <dig> pm for c2c12bra and hepg2bra cells, respectively. bmp- <dig> was the least potent inducer of luciferase expression with an ed <dig> of approximately  <dig>  nm and a sensitivity between  <dig>  to  <dig>  nm for the hepg2bra reporter assay. the dependence of the assay for the ligand was shown for bmp- <dig> by inclusion of a neutralizing antibody for bmp- <dig>  that blocked the luciferase response .

effect of incubation time on luciferase activity
next we tested the response of c2c12bra cells to recombinant bmp- <dig> using different incubation times and different concentrations of the growth factor. at a concentration of recombinant bmp- <dig> as low as  <dig>  pm, the sensitivity of the c2c12bra cells was equivalent for incubation times of  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h but decreased at an incubation time of  <dig> h . when c2c12bra cells were stimulated with concentrations above  <dig>  pm, incubation times between  <dig> h and  <dig> h were optimal. shorter or longer incubation times yielded decreased responses . it is interesting that the luciferase response declined at the longer time points. the reasons for this are unclear but may relate to the kinetics of gene expression and stability of the luciferase.

specificity of the assay
next we investigated the effect of different concentrations of serum on the stimulation of luciferase activity with recombinant bmp- <dig>  the responses of hepg2bra and c2c12bra cells differed with respect to serum concentrations. the presence of serum impaired the response of hepg2bra cells at all concentrations of rbmp- <dig> tested, with a strong decrease in sensitivity with medium containing 10% fbs and a mild decrease with serum concentrations of 1%, 2% and 5% . with hepg2bra cells, the luciferase response was best using serum-free medium and bsa added at a final concentration of  <dig> % . on the other hand, 10% serum had only a minor effect on the response of c2c12bra cells compared to incubation with dmem-bsa medium . at a low bmp- <dig> concentration , the relative luciferase activity in the presence of 10% fbs was actually higher compared to that with serum-free medium. addition of 1% or 2% serum shifted the curve downward at all bmp- <dig> concentrations tested .

we also tested the induction of luciferase activity with other members of the tgf-β superfamily, such as tgf-β <dig>  tgf-β <dig>  tgf-β <dig>  as well as tgf-β-unrelated growth factors, such as fgf- <dig> and vegf. as shown in fig.  <dig>  although bmp- <dig> at  <dig> pm induced a strong luciferase expression, there was no elevation of luciferase activity when cells were incubated with different isoforms of tgf-β even at concentration as high as  <dig> ng/ml.  <dig> ng/ml of bfgf or vegf did not induce luciferase expression.

it is well established that tgf-β and bmp can modulate the activity of each other through cross-talk of their respective pathways  <cit> . therefore, we examined whether tgf-β <dig> would affect the induction of luciferase activity by recombinant bmp- <dig>  as shown in fig. 6a, increasing the concentration of active tgf-β <dig> reduces the luciferase activity induced by bmp- <dig> with both c2c12bra and hepg2bra cells. similar results were obtained with tgf-β <dig> and tgf-β <dig> . we performed the opposite experiment using tgf-β-responsive reporter cells  that produce luciferase activity in response to tgf-β  <cit> . tmlc were co-stimulated with  <dig> pg/ml of tgf-β <dig> and increasing concentrations of bmp- <dig> . compared to the effect of tgf-β on the bmp-responsive reporter cells, bmp- <dig> had a very slight effect on luciferase activity induced by tgf-β <dig> in tmlc cells even at a concentration as high as  <dig>  ng/ml.

measurement of bmp activity from biological samples
we tested the bmp assay with conditioned medium from cos cells transiently transfected with either a dorsalin- <dig>  or a bmp- <dig> expression plasmid. dorsalin is member of the bmp family that regulates dorsoventral patterning of the neural tube. like bmps, dsl- <dig> induces alkaline phosphatase synthesis in an osteoblast differentiation assay  <cit> . we found that both dsl-1- and bmp-4-conditioned medium induced the expression of luciferase, whereas mock conditioned medium had no effect . conditioned medium from 293t cells transfected with a bmp- <dig> expression plasmid led to a substantial increase in luciferase activity compared to mock conditioned medium . we also cocultured c2c12bra cells with  <dig> cells stably transfected with bmp- <dig> expression plasmid and observed a substantial induction of luciferase activity compared to  <dig> cells stably transfected with an empty plasmid .

we determined if the reporter assay could be used to detect and quantify bmp activity in biological samples without any enrichment, i.e. concentrating the conditioned medium or overexpressing bmp in cells. for this purpose we measured bmp activity in conditioned medium from lung fibroblasts established from wt and ltbp- <dig> hypomorphic mice . it was reported that ltbp-4-/- lung fibroblasts express more bmp- <dig> and less gremlin, a bmp inhibitor, compared to the wt cells  <cit> . as shown in fig. 7d, conditioned medium from ltbp-4-/- cells induced luciferase activity more efficiently than wt cells in c2c12bra cells. the difference between wt and ltbp-4-/- cells corresponded to a bmp- <dig> concentration of ~ <dig>  pm. we also cocultured c2c12bra cells with wt and ltbp-4-/- lung fibroblasts and again observed more bmp activity in ltbp-4-/- cells compared to wt cells . in fact, the coculture assay yielded almost twice the activity as the assay using conditioned medium. inclusion in the assay of noggin, an inhibitor of bmp, blocked the bmp activity observed in ltbp-4-/- cells .

discussion
currently, the alp assay is the most widely and routinely used cell-based assay to measure bmp activity. alp expression is a marker of osteoblast differentiation and bmp-induced osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal cells. however, this assay has several drawbacks. the time required to perform the assay is long, usually between two to five days. this assay is not sensitive enough to detect bmp concentrations generated in many biological systems and alp expression can be affected negatively or positively by a variety of other signaling pathways, such as sonic hedgehog, fgf- <dig> or wnt/beta-catenin  <cit> .

in the present paper, we describe the establishment of a highly sensitive and specific assay to measure bmp activity. two stable cell clones, c2c12bra and hepg2bra, were isolated after transfection of c2c <dig> and hepg <dig> cells with an expression construct containing distinct sequence motifs derived from the mouse id <dig> promoter fused to a luciferase gene. when compared to other available cell-based bioassays or protein-based assays, our assay provides improved sensitivity for several bmp types, is faster, and is more specific for the measurement of bmp activity in complex biological solutions and in various biological situations.

recently, another cell-based assay was described using c3h10t1/ <dig> embryonic mouse cells stably transfected with the same reporter construct that we used in our assay  <cit> . although the c3h10t1/ <dig> assay can detect recombinant bmp- <dig> in dmem-bsa at twofold lower concentration than our assay, our assay is more sensitive when measuring the activity of bmp- <dig>  and bmp- <dig> . moreover, the sensitivity of the c3h10t1/ <dig> assay was diminished when performed in the presence of large excess of foreign protein, i.e. concentrations of serum above 2%. although the sensitivity of hepg2bra cells was also decreased by increasing concentration of serum, the ability of c2c12bra cells to measure concentrations of recombinant bmp- <dig> as low as  <dig> pm was not affected by concentrations of serum as high as 10%. thus, depending upon the biological medium to be assayed, one could use either c2c12bra or hepg2bra cells. finally, we show how the assay sensitivity can be enhanced by cocultures of test cells and reporter cells.

radioimmunoassays and enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assays  are sensitive and specific and have been developed for bmps  <cit> . the disadvantages of these assay are that they are expensive and that they measure both biologically active and inactive bmps. recently, a new protein based assay named elira  was developed for quantification of recombinant bmp- <dig>  <cit> . although this assay measures the quantity of bmp- <dig> that binds to its receptors, this binding does not necessarily mean that the protein is biologically active. our assay quantifies only bmp that is biologically active as opposed to immuno-reactive bmp. moreover, the lower detection limit of the elira was high  compared to our assay and assay performance was disturbed by the presence of foreign proteins  <cit> .

the differential sensitivity of c2c12bra and hepg2bra cells observed for different bmps might be explained by the different expression patterns of endogenous bmps and bmp receptors as characterized by rt-pcr . distinct bmps have different effects depending on the nature, the absolute number and the different combinations of bmp type i and type ii receptors on the cell surface  <cit> . the higher sensitivity of c2c12bra cells compared to hepg2bra cells when measuring bmp- <dig> activity might be due to the lower endogenous expression of bmp- <dig> in c2c12bra cells compared to hepg2bra cells . although our assay is not bmp-isoform specific, the appropriate addition of neutralizing antibodies for a given bmp and the use of a standard curve should allow the quantification of specific biologically active bmps.

as shown in fig. 6a, whereas our assay is specific for bmp, luciferase expression induced by bmp can be affected by active tgf-β. to our knowledge, this is the first time that this observation has been made for this bmp reporter construct. although tgf-β does not have an effect on id expression by itself, tgf-β might indirectly modify the effect of bmp by sequestering smad <dig> or induction of the expression of i-smads  <cit> . tgf-β activity measured with a tgf-β reporter assay was not affected by recombinant bmp- <dig> . this is likely due to the lack of functional bmp-smad pathway in these cells. interestingly, the sensitivity of c2c12bra for bmp- <dig> is only minimally affected by high concentrations of serum known to contain tgf-β . this observation can be explained by the fact that tgf-β in serum is in a latent form that must be activated in order to bind to its receptor and thus interfere with the bmp signaling pathway  <cit> .

beside its high sensitivity and specificity, another major advantage of our assay is the possibility to measure bmp activity from biological samples in a simple and efficient way. quantification of bmp activity in complex biological solutions, as opposed to a defined medium, such as dmem-bsa, is necessary for a cell-based assay to be useful to address specific problems related to bmp activity. in this paper, we describe the use of this assay in several ways to enhance its utility. first, we tested the possibility of this assay to measure bmp activity in non-defined medium. our bmp reporter assay detected bmp activity in the conditioned medium of cos and 293t cells transfected with bmp- <dig> and bmp- <dig> expression plasmids, respectively . interestingly, the amount of bmp activity detected in the conditioned medium was highly dependent on the cell line used to overexpress the specific bmp isoform. this might be due, as mentioned in previous studies, to the cell-specific expression pattern of proprotein convertases involved in the processing of the bmp inactive precursor form  <cit> . second, c2c12bra cells measure bmp activity when cocultured with  <dig> cells stably transfected with a bmp- <dig> expression vector . the advantage of this arrangement is that one can measure very low concentrations of bmp because of an increase in the local concentration of the cytokine without much dilution in the media. third, this assay can measure endogenous bmp secreted by cells. disruption of the ltbp- <dig> gene in mice results in abnormal lung development due to an enhanced activation of the bmp- <dig> signaling pathway both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . microarray analysis revealed that isolated ltbp-4-/- lung fibroblasts from these mice express more bmp- <dig> and less of its inhibitor gremlin compared to wt cells  <cit> . here we confirm these findings by showing that ltbp-4-/- cells produce more bmp activity than wt cells . interestingly, coculture of the bmp reporter assay cells with ltbp-4-/- cells detected more bmp activity than when reporter cells were incubated with conditioned medium. this is probably due to an increase in the local concentration of bmp- <dig> without dilution of the cytokine in the media. the difference in luciferase activity between wt and ltbp-4-/- cells was bmp-specific as the inclusion of noggin, a specific bmp inhibitor, in the coculture blocked the luciferase response induced by ltbp-4-/- cells .

CONCLUSIONS
we have generated a rapid, specific and sensitive cell-based bioassay that can be used to measure bmp activity in complex solutions and in various biological contexts. moreover, this bioassay can be used to study bmp signaling and to screen and identify new targets to modify bmp signaling pathways either positively or negatively.
