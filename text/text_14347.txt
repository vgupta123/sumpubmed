BACKGROUND
the orange-spotted grouper , an important cultured marine fish with a high market value, is an ideal model for studying sex differentiation and reproduction  <cit> . rapid expansion of aquaculture has, however, led to an increased incidence of disease outbreaks in recent years  <cit> . emerging viral infectious diseases, including iridovirus and nodavirus, have caused serious damage to the grouper aquaculture industry with mortality rates due to iridovirus infections ranging from 30%  to 100%   <cit> . to date, three iridoviruses that were isolated from diseased groupers have been characterized: singapore grouper iridovirus , orange-spotted grouper iridovirus  and taiwan grouper iridovirus   <cit> . nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms associated with iridovirus pathogenesis and virus-host interactions are largely unknown, due to the limited amount of available genomic information on e. coioides.

rapid progress in next-generation sequencing technologies can be used for large-scale efficient and economical production of ests. de novo transcriptome sequencing using  <dig> pyrosequencing has thus become an important method for studying non-model organisms  <cit> . transcriptome sequencing facilitates functional genomic studies, including global gene expression, novel gene discovery, assembly of full-length genes, and single nucleotide polymorphism  discovery  <cit> . to our knowledge, the genome sequence of e. coioides is still unavailable, and this has hindered the progress of immunological and developmental research. to overcome this obstacle, the  <dig> pyrosequencing technology was applied to determine the transcriptome sequence of e. coioides spleen tissue and a comparative analysis of transcriptome data between the control and the sgiv infected group was performed in this study. the data obtained disclosed a great deal of novel gene information in marine fish and suggested that several intracellular immune signaling pathways were involved in virus infection. these results will shed new light on the understanding of marine fish defense mechanisms to viral pathogens.

RESULTS
sequence analysis of ests from different cdna libraries
sequencing data from two different libraries was submitted to the ncbi database . in the control  and the sgiv  infected spleen libraries, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> ests were sequenced, respectively. following adaptor sequence and low quality sequences trimming  <dig>   and  <dig>  , high-quality ests were obtained from the two libraries. after sequence assembly,  <dig>  non-redundant ests were generated in the control library, including  <dig>  singlets and  <dig>  contigs with an average length of  <dig> bp. in the infected library,  <dig>  non-redundant ests were generated, including  <dig>  singlets and  <dig>  contigs, with an average length of  <dig> bp .

n <dig> = median length of the sequences of all the contigs

all the contigs and singlets were designated as unique sequences and used for further comparative sequence analysis between the two libraries. after a homology search in the non-redundant protein database at the national center for biotechnology information , a total of  <dig>   and  <dig>   unique sequences showed significant blastx hits of known protein sequences. the distribution of significant blastx hits over different organisms was analyzed. due to the lack of e. coioides genomic information, the majority of sequences in the two libraries matched genes or fragments from tetraodon nigroviridis .

functional annotation based on go, cog and kegg analysis
the putative functions of unique sequences in two different libraries were analyzed according to gene ontology  and clusters of orthologous groups of protein  classifications. analysis of go categories showed that the functional distribution of the genes of the two libraries was similar. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique sequences map to biological processes,  <dig>  and  <dig>  sequences map to cellular components, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  sequences map to molecular functions in the control and sgiv infected libraries, respectively. in both libraries, most of the corresponding biological process genes were involved in cellular processes, biological regulation and metabolic processes. most of the cellular component genes encode proteins associated with parts of cells and cell organelles; most of the molecular function genes were associated with binding, catalytic activity, and transporter activity .

classification of the unigenes into cog categories is critical for functional and evolutionary studies  <cit> . among the  <dig> cog categories, the cluster in the control library for "translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis" represented the largest group , followed by the "posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones" and "general function prediction" clusters. similarly, in the sgiv infected library, the cluster for "translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis" represented the largest group  followed by "general function prediction" and "posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones" clusters .

kegg is a pathway-based categorization of orthologous genes that provides useful information for predicting functional profiles of genes  <cit> . in this study the unique sequences of two libraries were categorized within the kegg database. the matched sequences were involved in metabolism processes, cellular processes, signal transduction and cell cycles. partial kegg pathways associated with immune and inflammation responses are listed in table  <dig>  the conserved mapk signaling molecules can be found in control  and sgiv-infected libraries , which contained  <dig> and  <dig> ests, respectively . in addition, a large number of ests were involved in rig-i signaling pathway , tlr signaling pathway , chemokine signaling pathway  and p <dig> signaling pathway  in two different libraries . many ests associated with mammalian signaling pathway genes, including map kinase phosphatase  <dig> , nur <dig>  stimulator of interferon genes , and tripartite motif protein  were initially disclosed in marine fish.

putative genes involved in up-regulation or down-regulation during sgiv infection
among unique sequences that shared > 30% identity  to known genes in the ncbi database,  <dig>  genes were cross-expressed in both the control and the sgiv-infected libraries. using the fisher's exact test based on the number of homologous ests, we found that  <dig> genes were significantly up-regulated, while  <dig> genes were significantly down-regulated in response to sgiv infection. a large number of genes were only present in either the control library or the sgiv-infected library. the up-regulated and down-regulated partial genes are listed in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the alternated genes included cytoskeletal genes, enzymes, and other immune-related genes, such as chemokines, interleukins and interferon-induced proteins. these genes have different expression patterns during sgiv infection, which implies that they may play an important role in physiological processes associated with sgiv infection.

validation of the changes in gene expression by quantitative real-time pcr
to validate whether the up-regulated or down-regulated genes identified by statistical analysis were involved in sgiv infection, we detected the relative expression of partial genes using quantitative real time-pcr . as shown in figure  <dig>  the relative expression of il- <dig>  chemokine  ligand  <dig> , g-type lysozyme  and cystatin b increased significantly after sgiv infection, compared with the expression of these genes in the control fish. in contrast, the expression of the interferon-inducible gtpase  <dig> , transcription factor ii d , gamma interferon -inducible lysosomal thiol reductase  and c-c chemokine receptor type  <dig>  decreased after sgiv infection. thus, these results suggested that sgiv infection modulated numerous host gene expressions for the completion its life cycle.

discussion
an increasing number of reports reveal that transcriptome sequencing of cdna has became an efficient strategy for generating enormous sequences that represent expressed genes  <cit> . transcriptomes from a number of species including those from drosophila melanogaster, yeast, caenorhabditis elegans and various mammals and plants were carried out for different purposes  <cit> . however, genome and transcriptome data for many "lower" vertebrate species, particularly marine fishes, have not been disclosed. to our knowledge, a limited numbers of e. coioides genes were cloned and characterized, based on the bioinformatic analysis, including those involved in immune responses after pathogenic attack, growth and development  <cit> . given that the spleen is one of the most important organs associated with immune responses in fish and is also the main target organ for sgiv infection, the transcriptome sequencing of the e. coioides spleen can be expected to provide a significant number of ests for marine fish immune responses and contribute to understanding iridovirus-host interactions  <cit> .

after removal of overlapping sequences between the control and sgiv-infected libraries, we obtained  <dig> non-redundant consensus sequences from e. coioides. with the exception of sequences related to cellular structure and metabolism, abundant sequences were found to be homologous to known immune-relevant genes in other species, based on the blast, conserved domain database , and swiss-prot annotation  <cit> . more than  <dig> sequences shared homology to signaling molecules of the mammalian mitogen-activated protein kinase  pathways, such as critical molecules associated with extracellular signal-regulated kinase , p <dig> mapk, ras, rsk <dig>  mkk <dig>  mkk <dig>  ask <dig>  mek1/ <dig> and raf <dig>  the mammalian mapk signaling pathway was activated during virus infection and contributed to virus replication  <cit> . although the mapk signaling molecules including erk, c-jun n-terminal kinase  and p <dig> mapk were activated in the spleens of sgiv-infected fish  cells, identifying the exact roles of these molecules during sgiv replication will benefit from the e. coioides est information  <cit> . with the exception of homologue components in the mapk cascade, different members of interferon-related genes were obtained, including the interferon-induced protein viperin, the interferon-stimulated gene  <dig> , interferon-induced protein  <dig> kd , interferon-stimulated gene  <dig> , and interferon regulatory factors . interferon-induced, or stimulated, genes were important for the resistance of the host to virus infection, including virus entry, replication and release  <cit> . the e. coioides irf- <dig>  irf- <dig> and irf- <dig> genes have been cloned and characterized and irf- <dig> was confirmed as being vitally important for sgiv replication  <cit> . human isg <dig> expression is strongly up-regulated during viral infections, such as human cytomegalovirus  and herpes simplex virus , and isg <dig> up-regulation was considered to be involved in different strategies relating to the antiviral response  <cit> . ifp <dig> and isg <dig> were also involved in the cellular antiviral response against virus infection  <cit> . a detailed investigation on the functions of e. coioides interferon-related genes during sgiv infection will contribute greatly to understanding how the sgiv exploited, or evaded, the host interferon immune response.

we also obtained sequences that shared homology to sgiv-encoded immune evasion genes, including lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-α factor , tumor necrosis factor receptor , ubiquitin and bcl- <dig>  <cit> . iridovirus-encoded litaf and bcl- <dig> could mediate the fate of host cells by regulating apoptosis  <cit> . it has been reported that many viral immune evasion genes are considered as "stolen" mimics from the host and such viruses may interfere with the host response by modulating or disrupting the function of corresponding host genes  <cit> . the discovery of these sequences will be helpful in studies on host-virus interactions. in addition, we also found that other molecules such as lectin, hepcidin, lysozyme and antimicrobial peptide are involved in immune responses. the functions of these genes during virus infection will be investigated in the further studies.

based on results from exploratory statistical analysis, we identified genes that are up-regulated or down-regulated after sgiv infection. the present data from qrt-pcr analysis validated the hypothesis that expression of partial genes is regulated by sgiv infection, including cytokine, cytokine receptor and transcription factor, apoptosis-associated genes, interferon-related genes, and cytoskeleton genes. previous studies indicated that the expression of different groups of genes relating to cellular structure, apoptosis, gene transcription and immune regulation were altered in response to virus infections or other stimuli  <cit> . further research into the roles of these differentially-expressed genes will contribute to an increased understanding of the critical events that take place during sgiv replication.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we studied the immune response of marine fish to virus infection using sgiv infected e. coioides as a model. more than  <dig>  <dig> high-quality ests were obtained from the e. coioides spleen cdna library by  <dig> sequencing. these unique sequences contribute greatly to the investigation into changes in gene expression patterns and their molecular functions during pathogens infection, and also provide an abundant data source for the identification of novel genes in e. coioides. this gene information can be used to provide further insights into the functions of chemokines, proinflammatory factors, interferon-induced genes and other cytokines and will thus stimulate further study on the immune response of e. coioides to pathogens. the experimental validation of the gene expression alterations during sgiv infection provides new insights into understanding iridovirus-host interactions.
