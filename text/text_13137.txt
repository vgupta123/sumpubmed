BACKGROUND
the polymerisation of deoxyribonucleotides into dna is one of the most fundamental processes of life and is carried out by dna polymerases. a wide variety of these enzymes exist, including the accurate polymerases α, β, δ, ε and γ and also the more recently discovered translesion polymerases, which can show a more flexible substrate specificity  <cit> . the replicative polymerases all exist as multi-protein assemblies which show complex patterns of interaction, not only between individual subunits, but also with other components of the repair and replication machinery  <cit> . many of the components of the dna replication apparatus also show interactions with elements of the networks which regulate cell cycle progression and checkpoint control.

chromosomal replication in eukaryotic cells requires three distinct dna polymerases: α, δ and ε. the pol α-associated primase subunits synthesise oligonucleotides which are elongated for a short length  by the large catalytic subunit of dna polymerase α. these short rna-dna segments are then elongated by pol δ or ε through a series of reactions in which the pol α-primase complex is displaced by replication factor c -pcna. the precise roles played by pol δ and pol ε are still not completely clear. studies using purified protein preparations in sv <dig> dna replication in vitro show that pol α and pol δ are sufficient for the completion of dna replication, suggesting that pol δ acts as the major dna replicative polymerase  <cit> . however, we also know that pol ε is located at or near the replication fork and evidence for a direct role for pol ε in replication has emerged from xenopus cell free systems  <cit> . pol δ plays an essential role in both dna replication and repair: biochemical and genetic studies have implicated pol δ in mismatch repair  <cit> , nucleotide excision repair  <cit> , base excision repair  <cit>  and double strand break repair  <cit> . the action of pol δ as a processive enzyme requires its interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen  which functions as a molecular sliding clamp and which is loaded onto dna by the action of the rfc complex  <cit> .

recent studies in fission yeast  and mammalian cells have shown that the native form of dna polymerase δ consists of four subunits acting as a heterotetramer  <cit> . the large catalytic subunit, p <dig>  forms a tightly associated heterodimer with the p <dig> subunit and this dimeric form of the enzyme has been extensively studied. the function of the smallest subunit  is still poorly understood. in s. pombe, deletion of the p <dig> homologue, cdm <dig>  does not affect cell proliferation or cause sensitivity to dna damaging agents  <cit> . in vitro reconstitution experiments using purified human proteins have shown that p <dig> is not essential for pcna-dependent dna replication, but that it is required to give a polymerase activity comparable to that of the native pol δ complex isolated from cell extracts  <cit> . in s. pombe, over-expression of cdm <dig> can rescue temperature sensitive alleles in each of the genes encoding the other dna polymerase δ subunits  <cit> . this is consistent with a model in which this subunit stabilises the pol δ complex.

studies in s. pombe identified cdc <dig> as a subunit of dna polymerase δ. the catalytic subunit, pol <dig>  interacts directly with the s. pombe homologue of the p <dig> subunit, cdc <dig>  <cit> . cdc <dig> in turn interacts with cdc <dig>  which is the homologue of p <dig>  <cit> . cdc <dig> interacts directly with pcna and this interaction is mediated by a conserved pcna binding motif  <cit> . reconstitution of the subunits of dna pol δ from s. pombe has shown that although the three-subunit polymerase complex shows low basal processivity, this is markedly increased by the addition of cdc <dig> in pcna-dependent in vitro assays. both the three-subunit complex and four subunit complex containing cdc <dig> in which the pcna-binding motif has been deleted both required pcna for processive polymerisation, suggesting a second site within the complex for pcna interaction, possibly within the large catalytic subunit pol <dig>  <cit> . genetic experiments in s. pombe have shown that the ability of cdc <dig> to bind simultaneously to cdc <dig>  and to pcna is essential for its biological function  <cit> . the p <dig> subunit and its homologues all contain a consensus pcna-binding domain at the c-terminus which is homologous to that found in p <dig>  fen <dig>  dna ligase i, the large subunit of rfc and many other proteins involved in dna replication, repair and modification  <cit> . based on gel filtration experiments, the s. pombe polymerase δ complex was previously thought to exist as a dimer with cdc <dig> mediating the dimer interface  <cit> . it is now known that these results were due to the highly asymmetrical shape of cdc <dig> and that pol δ exists as a monomer  <cit> . similar results have been found in s. cerevisiae  <cit> .

the homologue of cdc <dig> in s. cerevisiae is pol <dig>  although a homologue of cdm1/p <dig> has not been found. in vitro experiments show that the addition of pol <dig> to the purified dimeric form of the polymerase results in an increased processivity rate and pol <dig> interacts with pcna  <cit> . surprisingly, pol <dig> is not essential; deletion of the pol <dig> gene results in a temperature sensitive phenotype and sensitivity to dna damage  <cit> . pol <dig> deletion is lethal when combined with a temperature sensitive mutation in pol <dig> which encodes the pol δ catalytic subunit. this suggests that, in contrast to s. pombe, the interaction between pol δ and pcna can be mediated by some other mechanism in s. cerevisiae. in native gel analysis using purified proteins, a well-defined complex between polymerase δ and pcna was only observed when pol <dig> was present containing an intact pcna-binding domain. however, in in vitro dna replication assays, loss of the p50-binding domain had a far stronger effect than loss of the pcna-binding domain on pcna-dependent polymerase processivity. this suggests that a region in addition to the pcna-binding consensus in pol <dig> contributes to the interaction of pcna with the polymerase complex  <cit> .

a direct interaction between pcna and the p <dig> subunit has been demonstrated in mammalian cells  <cit> , although this interaction does not seem to exist in either s. pombe or s. cerevisiae and some studies have failed to find it in human cells  <cit> .

in mammalian cells, the cdc <dig> homologue  was identified as a polymerase δ subunit by affinity chromatography using either pcna or anti-p <dig> antibodies to isolate the polymerase complex  <cit> . interaction studies using purified proteins have shown that p <dig> binds directly to pcna and p <dig>  p <dig> also stabilises the association between p <dig> and p <dig> and increases the overall affinity of the polymerase δ complex for pcna  <cit> . p <dig> was found to stimulate dna synthesis by three- to four-fold in the presence, but not in the absence of pcna. in contrast, basal dna synthesis by the p125-p <dig> dimeric complex is not stimulated by pcna  <cit> . however, these results are at variance with results showing that the processivity of the dimeric p125-p <dig> form of the polymerase could be stimulated by pcna  <cit> . using purified proteins from s. cerevisiae, dna replication by a dimeric complex of pol3-pol <dig>  which is equivalent to p125-p <dig> in human cells, was pcna-dependent, though proceeded inefficiently and was characterised by frequent pausing. addition of pol <dig>  which is equivalent to p <dig>  resulted in significantly increased pcna-dependent processivity  <cit> .

here we describe results from our examination of the interactions of human p <dig> pol δ subunit with pcna and with components of the dna polymerase δ complex in vivo. we have mapped interaction domains by expressing various regions of the protein and also analysed their subcellular localisation. we have measured fluorescence resonance energy transfer  to determine if p <dig> forms direct, rather than complex-mediated, interactions in vivo.

RESULTS
two-hybrid analysis of p66-protein interactions
two-hybrid analysis was used to investigate the potential interactions of p <dig> with the p <dig> subunit and with pcna. constructs were made expressing full-length p <dig> as fusions either with the transcriptional activation domain of gal <dig>  or the dna binding domain . as shown in figure  <dig>  the fusion protein expressed from pas-p <dig> showed a highly specific interaction with s. pombe pcna. human pcna could not be used as a pact fusion as this construct shows strong self-activation. there was no detectable p66-p <dig> interaction suggesting that the protein does not dimerise. this correlates with observations seen with s. cerevisiae: although the p <dig> homologue pol <dig> was initially thought to dimerise in the two hybrid system it was later found that this was due to the bridging activity of the endogenous s. cerevisiae pcna  <cit> . s. pombe cdc <dig> cannot be analysed in this way as it results in reporter activation when expressed as a fusion with the gal <dig> dna binding domain . no interaction was seen between p <dig> and cdc <dig>  or between p <dig> and any other proteins tested, including those known to interact with pcna in the replication complex such as fen <dig> or uracil dna glycosylase . although expression of pas-p <dig> results in some background reporter activation, it is clear that there is a significant interaction between the p <dig> and p <dig> subunits . this is also seen using pas-p <dig> and pact-p <dig> constructs . no significant levels of interaction was seen between the s. pombe homologue of p <dig>  cdc <dig>  and human p <dig>  it seems likely that this reflects the low levels of homology between p <dig> and cdc <dig>  which is less than 24% overall  <cit> .

to identify other proteins which interact with p <dig>  a two-hybrid screen was undertaken with the full-length protein fused to the gal <dig> dna binding domain.  <dig>  ×  <dig> clones were screened in two separate experiments and two independent positive clones identified with strong activation of the reporters his <dig> and β-galactosidase. these clones showed a very specific interaction with p <dig> when compared with a range of pact constructs and were both found to encoded full-length clones of p <dig>  to map the domain of p <dig> responsible for the interaction with p <dig>  various regions of p <dig> were tested in the two-hybrid system. the smallest clone which showed an interaction was that encoding amino acids  <dig> –  <dig>  which is a region similar to, though slightly smaller than, the cdc1-interacting region in cdc <dig> in s. pombe  <cit> .

interactions in human cells
to study the interaction of p <dig> with pcna further we used various constructs expressing p <dig> in human u2os osteosarcoma cells as fusions with enhanced green fluorescent protein . a conserved pcna-binding domain is localised at the c-terminus of p <dig> and this is conserved between other p <dig> homologues  <cit> . various c-terminal deletions of p <dig> were expressed as egfp-fusion proteins  and a construct expressing a full length egfp-p <dig> fusion protein mutated in a predicted nuclear localisation sequence also tested . immunoprecipitation was carried out from soluble cell extracts using an anti-egfp antibody. interaction with endogenous pcna was analysed by western blotting with an anti-pcna antibody . these results show that pcna co-immunoprecipitates with full length p <dig> when fused to egfp. we used both transiently transfected egfp-p <dig> and a stable cell line expressing this construct. the slightly higher level of pcna seen with the transiently transfected cells reflects the higher levels of egfp-p <dig> expressed . we were also able to show co-immunoprecipitation of myc-tagged p <dig> with pcna using the polyclonal rabbit anti-pcna polyclonal antibody  <dig> . compared to transient transfection of the full-length construct, deletion of the c-terminal  <dig> amino acids which contains the conserved pcna-binding domain qvisitgff reduced, though did not completely abolish the interaction of the egfp-tagged p <dig> with pcna. however, deletion of the c-terminal  <dig> amino acids abolishes the interaction completely. the levels of expression of the full-length p <dig>  Δ <dig> and Δ <dig> egfp fusion constructs were indistinguishable in these experiments . the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids which interacted with p <dig> in the two-hybrid system show no detectable interaction with pcna . immunoprecipitation of p <dig> from these extracts followed by detection of egfp by western blot confirms the two hybrid data that the region composed of amino acids 1– <dig> expressed by pegfp-p66s <dig> is sufficient for the interaction with p <dig> . these results confirm that the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids of p <dig> is sufficient for the interaction with p <dig> and show that the interaction of p <dig> with pcna is mediated in vivo by the conserved pcna-binding motif, though n-terminal flanking sequences are also important. they show that p <dig> can interact with p <dig> independently of its interaction with pcna. we also show that p <dig> mutated in a putative nuclear localisation sequence is capable of binding to both p <dig> and pcna .

further evidence to support the role of p <dig> of mediating the p50-pcna interaction is shown in figure 3c. anti-p <dig> antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation from either untransfected cells or those stably expressing egfp-p <dig>  it can be see that the amount of pcna co-immunoprecipitated is significantly increased in the cell expressing the increased levels of p <dig>  this suggests that p <dig> acts to mediate or otherwise stabilise the interaction between p <dig> and pcna, and that the level of p <dig> in the cell is limiting for this process.

we have shown that the p <dig> protein interacts with p <dig> and pcna and mapped the regions involved in these interactions. we predicted that high-level expression of regions of p <dig> which interact with only one of p <dig> or pcna would be deleterious to the cell by acting as a dominant negative. to investigate this phenomenon we undertook clonogenic assays to determine if expression of various domains was deleterious to the cell over a period of time. our results show that while expression of egfp-p <dig> was indistinguishable from the egfp control, expression of either egfp-p66Δ <dig> or egfp-p66s <dig> which do not interact with pcna, results in reduced cell proliferation following selection for plasmid maintenance .

subcellular localisation of p66
during s phase, p <dig> localised to distinct nuclear spots which are typical of replication foci . these foci or factories represent a conglomeration of proteins involved in dna replication and post-replicative processing which are brought together at sites of dna replication  <cit> . we also found that, following dna damage outside s-phase, p <dig> was localised to large foci within the nucleus which are typical of sites of dna repair. this is confirmed by the co-localisation of pcna to these foci. figure  <dig>  show cells fixed  <dig> minutes after a uv dose of  <dig> jm- <dig>  the upper cell shows a pattern of p <dig> and pcna localisation which is typical of s phase, while the lower cell shows a pattern typical of dna repair. this pattern of localisation is consistent with the role of dna polymerase δ in repair, especially nucleotide excision repair, and confirms that the p <dig> subunit is specifically involved.

analysis of the p <dig> protein sequence with the predictnls program lead to the identification of a single nuclear localisation sequence consisting of amino acids  <dig> –  <dig>   <cit> . using site-directed mutagenesis, we created the plasmid pegfp-p66nls which expresses egfp-p <dig> with the residues 320– <dig>  are mutated to ngg. this egfp-p66nls fusion protein was no longer exclusively localised to the nucleus, but was distributed throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm, indicating that this sequence represents a functional nuclear localisation sequence . interestingly, this protein is still capable of localising to replication foci during s phase and could still interact with both pcna and p <dig> , indicating that specific nuclear targeting is not a prerequisite for these processes. high levels of expression of this protein were not significantly deleterious to cell growth in colony assay experiments, suggesting that this nls mutant was still fully functional and did not act as a dominant negative .

many proteins have been identified which interact with pcna through the small conserved pcna-binding motif  <cit> . in some cases, this motif has been identified quite independently as a targeting sequence for localisation to replication foci  <cit>  and a model has been proposed in which pcna acts as an assembly platform for the replication machinery  <cit> . the conserved pcna-binding motif in p <dig> is located at the extreme c-terminus, and we have already shown that this sequence is involved in the interaction of p <dig> with pcna. to investigate the role of this domain in p <dig> sub-nuclear localisation, cells were transformed with the pegfp-p66Δ <dig> and pegfp-p66Δ <dig> constructs. these proteins were localised to the nucleus, but did not show a punctate pattern of localisation , suggesting that they were not exclusively localised to replication foci. we have already shown that deletion of the last  <dig> amino acids significantly, though not completely, abolishes the interaction with pcna while deletion of the last  <dig> amino acids completely abolishes this interaction. our results indicate that complete abrogation of the p66-pcna interaction is not required to abolish replication foci targeting. it also demonstrates that the interaction of p <dig> with pcna is not required for nuclear localisation.

since proteins that co-localise do not necessarily interact directly, we explored whether eyfp-p <dig> and ecfp-pcna directly interact in vivo. to do this we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer  technology to determine whether the fluorescent tags  are closer than  <dig> Å/ <dig> nm  <cit> . fret occurs only when the intensity of emitted light measured in the presence of two fluorescently tagged proteins are greater than emitted light from cells transfected with ecfp- or eyfp-tagged proteins alone . the details of the calculations used to analyse the fret signal are described in the methods section. it is expected that, in at least some replication forks within a replication focus, ecfp and eyfp tagged pcna will bind adjacently in the trimeric pcna clamp, thus tagged pcna were used as positive control. furthermore, since no interaction between ung <dig> and p <dig> could be detected in the yeast two-hybrid assay and there has been no report of an interaction between ung <dig> and p <dig>  we used ecfp-ung <dig> and eyfp-p <dig> as a negative control for the analysis of these in vivo interactions in human cells. we calculated fret from the mean intensities within a replication focus  and normalized these values against the different protein expression levels, nfret, in cells co-transfected with ecfp-pcna and eyfp- p <dig>  ecfp-pcna and eyfp-pcna  and ecfp-ung <dig> and eyfp-p <dig>  . the nfret levels of five representative replication foci in the higher range of fret values are given. varying nfret levels among different replication foci are as expected found since replication foci are dynamic structures and in addition endogenous proteins will compete with the tagged proteins for interactions. we find that the nfret levels between pcna and p <dig> are similar to nfret between pcna-pcna. p <dig>  pcna and ung <dig> are all localised to replication foci. in contrast, the nfret levels observed between pcna and p <dig> are four to five fold higher than between ung <dig> and p <dig>  indicating that pcna and p <dig> are not merely co-localised to the same complex, but show a direct physical interaction in living cells. to confirm that this interaction is not merely due to the presence of both p <dig> and pcna at the replication fork, we show that there is still a positive fret interaction between pcna and a p <dig> mutant which lacks the p <dig> interaction domain . by using fret we can clearly distinguish between co-localisation and interaction.

discussion
several lines of conflicting evidence exist concerning the mechanism of interaction of dna polymerase δ with pcna. the catalytic subunit p <dig> shows low activity and little response to pcna stimulation when over-expressed in insect cells. although direct interaction between pcna and the p <dig> subunit appears to take place in mammalian cells  <cit>  this either does not occur or is extremely weak in yeasts  <cit> . more recent work has shown that the major interaction between pcna and the dna polymerase complex is mediated by the third subunit, which is p <dig>  cdc <dig> and pol <dig> in mammalian cells, s. pombe and s. cerevisiae, respectively. p <dig> homologues have now been identified in a wide range of organisms, but in general they have a very poor level of protein sequence similarity with the exception of the conserved pcna-binding motif at the c-terminus.

here we describe the analysis the protein interaction domains of human p <dig> by expressing various tagged and fusion proteins in cultured cells and we have correlated their subcellular localisations with their interactions in vivo. in our initial experiments using the two-hybrid system we were able to show that p <dig> was able to interact with both p <dig> and pcna. this is similar to results seen in the s. pombe and s. cerevisiae homologues of p <dig>  we also show that p <dig> does not dimerise in this system. in a two-hybrid screen using p <dig> as bait, the only positive clones identified were those expressing full-length p <dig>  we did not expect to identify human pcna in this screen, as the full-length protein when fused to the gal <dig> activation domain results in a construct that is self-activating and so would be excluded as a false positive. the p50-interacting domain was mapped to amino acids 1– <dig>  which is similar, though slightly smaller than the cdc <dig> interaction region in cdc <dig> 

using various domains of p <dig> expressed as fusions with egfp in human cells, we were able to confirm that the domain identified as interacting with p <dig> using the two-hybrid system was also sufficient for the interaction in cell extracts using co-immunoprecipitation experiments. this domain showed no detectable interaction with pcna. we also found that high levels of expression of either the p50-interacting or the pcna-interacting domains are deleterious to cell proliferation over periods of growth selection in colony assays. this indicates that these domains can act as "dominant negatives" to compete for binding to the endogenous p <dig> and pcna.

fine mapping of the pcna-binding domain at the c-terminus showed that the p66Δ <dig> protein  significantly reduced, though did not completely abolish binding to pcna in co-immunoprecipitation assays. the deletion of an additional  <dig> amino acids completely abolished the interaction, suggesting a region n-terminal to the core-conserved domain makes a significant contribution to the pcna interaction. the best-characterised incidence of a pcna-interacting motif is in the cell cycle regulatory protein p21waf <dig>  the crystal structure of the pcna-binding region from this protein complexed with pcna has been solved which shows that the conserved motif makes a helical turn which has interactions within a hydrophobic pocket on pcna. sequences c-terminal to the motif make a β-sheet interaction with the inter-domain linker region of pcna. in proteins such as dna ligase i and the largest subunit of rfc the conserved motif lies at the extreme n-terminus indicating that n-terminal regions do not play a role in the pcna interaction. however, in p <dig> we see that sequences lying up to  <dig> amino acids n-terminal to the conserved motif clearly play a role in the interaction. the mechanism by which this region interacts with pcna awaits further investigation. the conserved pcna-binding motif has been linked to replication foci targeting: in dna ligase i the n terminal  <dig> amino acids containing the pcna-binding motif are capable of directing localisation of heterologous proteins to replication foci  <cit> . however, we show here that the p66-Δ <dig> construct, which is still capable of binding to pcna, does not appear to be targeted to replication foci. this result is difficult to interpret, as it may be that a small proportion of it, corresponding to the smaller amount seen binding to pcna, is present in replication foci, but the amount is too low to be observed microscopically. it is clear that we see a correlation between pcna binding and localisation to replication foci, with both these phenomena mediated by the interaction of p <dig> with pcna through the conserved pcna-binding motif.

these results correlate with those found for the p <dig> homologue, cdc <dig>  in s. pombe where binding to pcna and protein function in vivo could be correlated. reynolds et al. showed that the c-terminal  <dig> amino acids of cdc <dig> were essential both for pcna binding and protein function. however, high level expression of a construct lacking the c-terminal  <dig> amino acids containing the core pcna-binding motif was still able to rescue growth of a cdc27Δ strain, though quite poorly. this suggests that regions of cdc <dig> n-terminal to the core pcna binding domain may also contribute to pcna binding  <cit> .

we have shown that p <dig> is a nuclear protein which is excluded from the nucleolus and is localised to replication foci during s phase. this pattern of localisation is shared with many proteins involved in dna replication such as pcna, pol α, fen <dig>  dna ligase i, rfc, rpa etc.  <cit> . this pattern of co-localisation does not in itself show that the proteins make a direct physical interaction. to investigate this, we have used fret analysis to substantiate a direct interaction between p <dig> and pcna in vivo. we find that the nfret between pcna and p <dig> is similar to the nfret shown by the extremely stable pcna-pcna interaction,  and are considerably higher than between proteins that co-localise, but do not interact, such as ung2-p <dig>  these results, together with the two hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation data, strongly support a direct physical interaction between p <dig> and pcna in vivo.

in cell lines which stably express egfp-p <dig> in addition to endogenous p <dig> we see an increased amount of pcna associated with p <dig> compared to cells containing endogenous levels of p <dig>  since we already know that p <dig> can interact with both p <dig> and pcna, this is strongly suggestive that the increased levels of p <dig> are stabilising the interaction. this implies that p <dig> mediates this interaction and that the level of p <dig> is a limiting factor for the amount of the polymerase complex associated with pcna. this raises the interesting possibility that levels or localisation of p <dig> may play a regulatory role in dna replication.

CONCLUSIONS
previously published work on the human p <dig> dna polymerase δ subunit has shown that it forms part of the polymerase complex and interacts with pcna in cell extracts  <cit> . p <dig> has been shown to bind p <dig> and pcna using purified proteins  <cit> . in this work, we show that p <dig> interacts with p <dig> and pcna using human cell extracts, and have mapped the protein domains involved in this interaction in vivo. the dominant negative effect upon proliferation shown by p <dig> constructs which cannot bind to pcna suggests that the p66-pcna interaction is an essential one. we also show that p <dig> is located to sites of dna synthesis following dna damage, which demonstrates that this subunit is present in the form of polymerase δ which is involved in dna repair. we have identified a nuclear localisation sequence and show that p <dig> localisation to replication foci during s phase is not dependent upon active nuclear import. finally we show that p <dig> is localised to replication foci in living cells using fret techniques and show that it interacts directly with pcna in these complexes.
