BACKGROUND
previous work has shown that polyhexamethylene biguanide  was effective in selectively killing the yeasts that are regarded as contaminants of the ethanol fermentation process, with special attention being paid to dekkera bruxellensis  <cit> . phmb has been used as an antiseptic and disinfectant in medicine and industry, and its current applications include the following: impregnation of fabrics to inhibit microbial growth  <cit> , water treatment  <cit> , disinfection of a wide range of solid surfaces such as contact lenses  <cit> , mouthwashing  <cit> , the treatment of hatching eggs to prevent contamination by salmonella  <cit> , treatment against fungi  <cit>  and acanthamoeba  <cit> . its commercial preparations consist of mixtures of polymeric biguanides of blocks with molecular structure n, where n may vary from  <dig> to  <dig>  and molecular mass ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> .

the heterogeneity of the molecule is increased further by the presence of either amine, or cyanoguanidine or guanidine end-groups in any combination at the terminal positions of each chain. nonetheless, the cationic nature of the guanidine group makes the molecule positively charged at physiological to low ph  <cit> . as a result, phmb is highly adsorptive to anionic surfaces such as bacterial cell walls and its biocidal mechanism may include damage to the cell membrane  <cit> . at lower concentrations, it has been suggested that the bacteriostatic effects of phmb may be partly due to a powerful cooperative interaction with  nucleic acids  <cit> . it was suggested that phmb should interact with phospholipids of the acanthamoeba cell membrane and thus cause changes in cell permeability  <cit> , and this was further supported by work on e. coli  <cit> . the external layer of saccharomyces cerevisiae and other yeast species plasma membrane is enhanced by phosphatidylcholine, ergosterol and sphingolipids  <cit> . owing to the cationic nature of phmb, its toxic effect may be mediated by its links to the negative phospholipids on the yeast cell surface. in the presence of phmb, the homogeneous distribution of phospholipids that are usually linked to biological membranes, is transformed into a mosaic of individual phospholipid domains that produce fluid and liquid crystalline regions in the cell membrane  <cit> . by means of the whole-genome transcriptional profile, allen et al  <cit>  show that e. coli responds to bacteriostatic levels of phmb by altering the expression of many of the genes involved at all levels of the cell ultra structure, i.e. the outer membrane, periplasm, inner membrane and cytoplasmic domains, but not the lipolysaccharide layer. there was also an alteration in the expression of genes associated with stresses such as acid resistance, alkali resistance, osmotic shock and cell-envelope perturbation.

as well as the fungicide activity in d. bruxellensis, pichia galeiformes and candida tropicalis, the yeast species isolated phmb as a contaminant through ethanol fermentation, and this also differentially affected saccharomyces cerevisiae industrial strains, for example the pe- <dig> strain was more affected than jp <dig>  <cit> . this result might impose constraints on the use of phmb in controlling incidents of yeast contamination in industrial fermentations. thus, the further steps towards developing industrial formulations of phmb, must rely on determining the identification of biological activity and targets of phmb on the yeast cells, and identifying the yeast mechanisms that respond to the damage caused by this biocide.

in this study, we have sought to understand the aspects of phmb-cell interaction discussed above, by adopting two strategies: 1) testing the biocide effects of phmb on the expression of yeast genes involved in the cell wall integrity mechanism  and 2) by testing yeast strains with mutations in genes involved in cwi and their oxidative stress response. the results strongly indicated that phmb may act by destabilizing the yeast cell wall, thus inducing the cell wall integrity pathway response. moreover, an account is given of the potential regulatory role of yap1p on the expression of cwi genes.

RESULTS
phmb treatment induces genes of the yeast cell wall integrity  sensing mechanism
our previous results showed that the lethal effect of phmb on yeast cells was partly mitigated by trehalose  <cit> , which is known to be a protective agent of the cell envelope  <cit> . moreover, previous global gene expression analysis revealed that exposure of e. coli cells to phmb induced the expression of genes involved in cell wall maintenance  <cit> . this led us to search for cwi genes in the yeast genome . moreover, recent studies have shown that some genes involved in trehalose metabolism are regulated by stress response elements  in their promoter region;  <cit> , in view of this we have included some yeast genes containing stre in their promoter in our analysis. from a list of selected genes , we conducted a quantitative pcr analysis after cell exposure to phmb and the results revealed that the chs <dig>  fks <dig>  gas <dig>  hsp <dig>  kre <dig>  msn <dig>  msn <dig>  pkh <dig> and ylr194c genes were up-regulated in the phmb-resistant jpi strain, while remaining unchanged in the phmb-sensitive pe- <dig> strain . moreover, crz <dig> and rlm <dig> genes were induced in jp <dig> and repressed in pe- <dig>  while cin <dig> and mnn <dig> did not change in jp <dig>  but were repressed in pe- <dig>  the expression of the slt <dig> gene remained unchanged in both the industrial strains .

the products of the chs <dig>  gas <dig>  fks <dig>  hsp <dig>  kre <dig>  pkh <dig> and ylr194c genes can be located either in the cell membrane or in the cell wall, and are mostly involved in the maintenance and remodeling of the cell envelope in response to environmental changes. the membrane-located chitin synthase  <dig>  encoded by chs <dig>  acts on the turn-over of the chitin in the septum during the cell division  <cit> . the gas <dig> gene product is a gpi-anchored protein located in the plasma membrane that acts by stretching the cover of β- <dig> -glucan during the remodeling of the cell wall. its expression is dependent on the sbf transcription factor, which comprises the swi4p and swi6p proteins  <cit> . the fks <dig> gene encodes the catalytic sub-unit of the  <dig> -β-d-glucan synthase complex. this complex is controlled by the regulatory subunit rho1p, which in turn is activated by the nutrient sensing tor pathway that regulates the activity of protein kinase c - pkc1p, a key component of the cell wall integrity  mechanism  <cit> . the hsp150p protein is located in the cell wall and is secreted into the medium in response to heat or osmotic shock. its gene is up-regulated under calcofluor white and zymolyase  <cit> , heat shock  <cit>  nitrogen limitation  <cit>  treatments and by decreasing the β- <dig> -glucan level in the cell wall  <cit> . the pkh <dig> gene encodes a phosphoinositol-dependent protein kinase, whose function overlaps pkh2p, and is involved in maintaining the cell wall. this protein phosphorylates and activates pkc1p  <cit> . the orf ylr194c encodes for a putative gpi-attached protein and its expression is induced by cell wall stress or by mutation in the fks <dig> gene  <cit> . the mnn <dig> gene encodes a β- <dig> -mannosyltransferase involved in the transfer of mannose from udp-mannose to oligosaccharides during the synthesis of the β-glucan bridge of the cell wall  <cit> . in addition, the kre <dig> gene encodes a putative synthetase that acts on the synthesis of the β- <dig> -glucan cover and mutation in this gene causes a 50% reduction in the synthesis of β- <dig> -glucan in the cell wall  <cit> . the kre6p protein was shown to be phosphorylated and genetically interact with components of the pkc1p-mediated map kinase pathway  <cit>  in order to regulate the β- <dig> -glucan synthesis  <cit> . it was found that over-expression of the kre <dig> gene offset the defect in the cell wall organization of the pkc1-mutant  <cit> . thus, this gene could be a key to explain the difference in resistance of the two industrial strains to phmb, since it was highly expressed in the phmb-resistant jp <dig> strain .

crz1p is a calcineurin-dependent zinc finger- type transcription factor that binds to the promoters of the fks <dig> and chs <dig> genes in response to calcofluor and calcium, respectively  <cit> . both genes were found to be co-expressed, with a peak in g <dig>  when the isotropic cell wall synthesis allowed daughter-cell expansion  <cit>  and our results  corroborate that of the co-expression pattern. the lower expression level of the crz <dig> gene in pe- <dig> could explain the lack of chs <dig> and fks <dig> induction in this strain, and together with the low expression of kre <dig>  could produce the previously mentioned sensitive phenotype of the pe- <dig> strain to phmb  <cit> . moreover, these results suggest that the tolerance of the jp <dig> strain might be due to a more effective restoration of the cell envelope after it has been damaged by phmb. this might be evidence that phmb damages the glucan structure on the yeast cell wall.

resistance to phmb depends on the functionality of the pkc and hog mechanisms
to test the hypothesis of cell wall damage, resistance to phmb was evaluated in yeast strains with deletion in a series of cwi genes, including the genes involved in the hog and pkc pathways . the results of the cytotoxicity assay showed that deletion of the slg1/wsc <dig>  slt <dig>  rom <dig>  swi <dig>  swi <dig> and knr <dig> genes impaired the chances of cell survival to exposure to phmb, while deletion of hog <dig> and mkk <dig> genes only affected cell survival at higher phmb concentration . the remaining mutants tested did not show altered sensitivity to this compound . slg1/wsc <dig> gene encodes one of the sensor-transducer proteins located in the cell membrane that activates the gdp/gtp exchange protein rom2p in response to cell wall damage  <cit> . it was observed that the absence of this protein impairs the activation of slt2p/mpk1p kinase by heat shock  <cit> . the hypersensitivity of the Δslg1/wsc <dig> mutant to phmb , together with the parental phenotype of yeast mutants for other sensors , showed that slg1p/wsc1p is the main sensor for the damage caused by phmb.

following the pkc cascade, it was observed that the Δrom <dig> mutant was very sensitive to phmb . the gtp/gdp-exchange factor rom2p activates the ras-like protein kinase rho1p that triggers the pkc cascade by activating pkc1p, which in turn activates bck1p  <cit> . bck1p, known as map kinase kinase kinase , phosphorylates mkk2p  in response to cell wall damage, which further phosphorylates mpk1p/slt2p . the parental phenotype of the Δbck <dig> mutant and the intermediary sensitivity of the Δmkk <dig> mutant to phmb  could be explained by the complementation by their paralogous bck2p and mkk1p, respectively.

furthermore, the hyper-sensitivity of the Δmpk1/slt <dig> mutant  showed the importance of the slt <dig> gene in phmb resistance. slt2p resides predominantly in the nucleus under non-stress conditions, but rapidly relocates to the cytoplasm in response to cell wall stress  <cit> . once activated, slt2p phosphorylates and activates the rlm1p  <cit>  transcription factor, as well as swi4p  <cit> . as stated above, swi4p and swi6p form the sbf transcriptional factor that regulates the cwi genes, such as gas <dig>  fks <dig> and smi1/knr <dig>  <cit> . mutation of the smi1/knr <dig> gene increased the sensitivity of the yeast cells to phmb . it was recommended that smi1p/knr4p should coordinate the cell cycle progression in connection with cell wall synthesis and this protein was shown to be essential for viability of the cell in the absence of a functional pkc1/slt <dig> pathway  <cit> . a physical interaction between knr4p and slt2p was also described and it was proposed that such interaction modulate the slt2p-dependent activation of rlm <dig> and sbf transcriptional factors  <cit> . activation of rlm1p induces the expression of chs <dig>  fks <dig>  kre <dig> and hsp <dig>  <cit> , the same genes up-regulated in jp <dig> strain upon the phmb treatment .

finally, the Δhog <dig> mutation showed intermediate sensitivity to phmb . it was suggested that at hyperosmotic shock, hog1p activates rlm1p that in turn regulates the subsequent expression of the slt <dig> gene  <cit> . thus, a cross-talk between hog and pkc mapk pathways should be established following the perturbation of the cell wall. the results of this research indicate that hog1p may act as an amplifier of the sensing mechanism of the cell wall damage caused by phmb, as has been recently described in the case of other cell wall damage  <cit> . furthermore, double mutant analysis showed that there was a synergistic interplay between hog1p and yap1p in a resistance to arsenite stress, which suggests the existence of a genetic inter-dependence of both genes on the stress response  <cit> . recent studies have shown that hog1p is involved in cell wall remodeling by regulating the expression of exg <dig> gene, which encodes the glucanase that affects the level of β-glucan  <cit> . this hypothesis supports the idea that pkc and hog pathways converge to regulate the maintenance of the cell wall  <cit> . on the basis of this evidence, we suggest that phmb may affect the β-glucan structure of the cell wall that is sensed by the pkc pathway, together with hog1p.

the yap <dig> gene is also involved in the cellular resistance to phmb, but not through oxidative stress response
following the induction of the msn <dig> and msn <dig> genes in the jp <dig> strain upon exposure to phmb , we further screened the collection of deletion strains whose genes encode proteins involved in the complex general stress response mechanism . among these, the Δyap <dig> mutant showed a high degree of sensitivity to phmb . it was suggestive of the induction of oxidative damage to the cell membrane by phmb. the yap1p-mediated regulatory pathway that controls the oxidative stress adaptive response is activated by redox sensory mechanisms that detect changes in the intracellular redox balance caused by reactive oxygen species  and by oxidized thiols such as glutathione, thiorredoxin and sh-containing proteins  <cit> . sulfhydryl groups, including non-protein , mostly represented by glutathione, and protein bound , are abundant in cells and can be oxidized by ros  <cit> . nevertheless, we did not observe only a small change in the mobilization of intracellular thiol groups when by <dig> or yap <dig> strains are submitted to phmb for  <dig> hours, as it was observed after h2o <dig> reference treatment . moreover, no increase in the peroxidation of the membrane phospholipids was observed . in addition, no other strain with deletion in oxidative stress genes was sensitive to phmb, except the Δctt <dig> mutant . the ctt <dig> gene encodes the cytosolic catalase t involved in the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water, which is regulated by the oxidative stress transcription factors yap1p and skn7p and by the general stress response transcriptional complex msn2/4p  <cit> . winderickx et al.  <cit>  found that oxidative stress-induced expression of ctt <dig> requires yap1p even though this gene does not include a yre motif in its promoter, although it contains a stre motif  <cit> . yap1p participates in the regulation of both antioxidant genes and several drug resistance genes  <cit> , and this transcription factor regulates the genes that do not have yre in their promoter regions  <cit> . yap1p plays a role in regulating the expression of components of the stre activation machinery, and as a result, the stre-dependent gene expression, even though yap <dig> does not bind stres directly  <cit> . this suggests that yap <dig> and ctt <dig> genes might be involved in the resistance to phmb in a way that is not linked to the oxidative stress response pathway. there are some indications of the participation of the upper elements of the pkc pathway in the survival of cells when subjected to oxidizing agents such as diamide and hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . it is known that ethanol induces the expression of various stress responsive genes, such as ctt <dig>  through the binding of the msn2/ <dig> transcriptional complex to their promoters. this complex is activated by hog1p phophorylation that leads to the migration of msn2p and msn4p from the cytosol to the nucleus so that they can trigger the induction of the target genes  <cit> . this indicates that there is a connection between the cwi pathway  and the oxidative stress response in saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which ctt1p can act as a bridge. very recently, liu et al  <cit>  found that sod <dig> gene is involved in tolerance to cell wall damaging agents in yeast, which supports this connection between these pathways.

it was shown that yap1p appears to be necessary to activate the srp <dig> gene that encodes a cell wall protein  <cit> . the Δyap <dig> mutant was reported to be sensitive congo red  <cit> , as we also observed . taken together, the evidence points to the involvement of yap1p in the cwi mechanism.

yap1p also regulates the expression of cwi genes
the possible involvement of yap1p in the regulation of cwi genes was tested by measuring the expression in parental and Δyap <dig> strains of those genes when they were up-regulated by phmb in the jp <dig> strain. the results showed that only kre <dig> and ylr194c were slightly up-regulated by phmb treatment in the parental by <dig> cells , which could explain the high sensitivity of this laboratory strain compared to jp <dig> . two results were particularly relevant in the Δyap <dig> mutant. first, the expression of the slt <dig> gene was down-regulated by a factor of ten , which was not observed even in the phmb-sensitive industrial pe- <dig> strain , and the slight expression of ylr194c was removed . it is also noteworthy that the cin <dig> gene showed up-regulation by a factor of  <dig>  after the phmb treatment , while no change was observed for this gene in either of the industrial strains . it can be concluded that yap1p also works in response to cell wall damage by controlling the expression of the genes at the lower part of the pkc cascade. it is known that slt2p phosphorylates and activates the rlm1p transcription factor, which in turn back-regulates the expression of the slt <dig> gene itself  <cit> . in view of this, yap1p could be involved in the regulation of both the rlm <dig> and slt <dig> gene expression. this idea was strengthened by further observation which showed that the slt <dig> gene was down-regulated in the Δyap <dig> mutant after heat shock treatment . the behavior of the rlm <dig> gene was opposite to its expression, in which a significant over-expression was observed in the Δyap <dig> mutant after heat shock treatment . thus, we suggest that yap1p should directly co-regulate the expression of the slt <dig> gene in response to damage in the cell wall. as a result, this protein should work on the co-regulation of cwi genes. this co-regulation can amplify the signal for cwi gene expression. it was reported that activation of slt2p by heat shock could occur in a pkc-independent manner  <cit> . thus, we suggest that this regulation should occur via yap1p. the presence of tf binding sites in the promoter region of the cwi genes was identified by an in silico analysis . the fact that we did not observe the presence of the conserved yap1-responsive element  motif at the slt <dig> gene promoter does not impair its regulation by yap1p. this suggestion is supported by experimental evidence that shows signs of the regulation of stre-dependent genes by yap1p, even though this protein does not recognize the stre motif  <cit> . all these possible alternatives must be tested further.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, the up-regulation of a number of genes required for cell wall polymer synthesis and remodeling has been shown by rt-qpcr upon phmb-treatment of phmb-resistant saccharomyces cerevisiae industrial jpi strain, but not in the phmb-sensitive pe- <dig> strain. this finding indicates the involvement of the cwi pathway in the tolerance to the cell wall stress caused by this biocide. in addition, the up-regulation of the genes encoding msn2/ <dig> transcription factors indicates that the general stress response could also be involved in yeast cell response to phmb. a cytotoxicity assay of the wild-type by <dig> strain and a series of mutant strains  confirmed the involvement of the cwi pathway in the response to phmb cell wall damage. hog1p should act as one of the modulators of this response. in addition, the products of yap <dig> and ctt <dig> genes also work on the resistance to phmb in a way that does not depend on their participation in the oxidative stress response pathway. the fact that slt <dig> gene expression was down-regulated after phmb or heat shock treatments in the Δyap <dig> mutant indicates the potential regulatory role of yap1p in the expression of cwi genes.
