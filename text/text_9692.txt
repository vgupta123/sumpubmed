BACKGROUND
although human alpha satellite dna sequences have been studied for decades, a number of their structural and evolutionary characteristics remain obscure. it is generally accepted that sequences constituting highly homogeneous arrays, including those within which the active centromere is formed, evolve in a concerted way  <cit> . in view of this concerted evolution, many authors have supposed that the repeats are homogenised with high efficiency, both intra-chromosomally and between homologues. at the same time, it has been shown that meiotic recombination is highly suppressed in the centromeric chromosomal regions  <cit> . indeed, it was recently shown that homologues can bear subsets of higher order repeats  that differ by a number of diagnostic variant nucleotides , indicating that exchanges between the homologues are at most highly limited  <cit> .

multiple molecular mechanisms are thought to underlie concerted evolution, principally unequal crossing over and gene conversion. two recent papers have discussed this in detail: schindelhauer and schwarz  <cit>  proposed that conversion, as opposed to unequal crossing-over, was the dominant mechanism behind the homogenisation of the hors on chromosome x. roizès  <cit> , on the other hand, using the examples of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  mainly considered unequal crossing over and suggested that conversion rather introduces divergence between the repeats of homogeneous arrays. it is difficult, however, to reconstruct the course of homogenisation of alpha satellite repeats in the absence of their map positions.

the fraction of the repeats within the homogeneous alphoid array at which cenp-a is recruited with other proteins  <cit>  to form the centromere has never been analysed in detail. in particular, it is not known whether these repeats differ from the other repeats in the array. interestingly, it has been recently shown that the repeats associated with the active centromeric chromatin of arabidopsis thaliana and zea mays are hypomethylated relative to the same repeats within the flanking pericentromeric chromatin  <cit> .

in this paper, we have further analysed the highly homogeneous arrays of a number of chromosome homologues . our analysis essentially confirms the initial results of roizès  <cit> , although the data are somewhat more complex and diverse than originally proposed. the d1z <dig> locus appears to be archetypical of the mode of evolution of these sequences. the fraction of the repeats associated with cenp-a was also analysed ; this analysis revealed that, while the cenp-a associated repeats evolve by the same molecular mechanisms as the other repeats, they constitute subsets that exhibit different combinations of dvns and thus distinct domains and subdomains within the overall centromeric array. negative selection seems to be acting during the homogenisation/amplification runs which drive them. on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  cenp-a associated alphoid repeats were recovered from two different and unrelated homogeneous arrays. these results are discussed in light of possible mechanisms for the formation, evolution, and loss of centromeres.

RESULTS
analysis of a long stretch of hors belonging to locus d1z5
although there is a large amount of alpha satellite dna sequence data in genomic databases, it was difficult to find sufficiently long, uninterrupted stretches of such dna among the numerous bacs that had been partially or totally sequenced. an examination of the maps of all the human chromosomes available on the web http://www.ensembl.org/homo_sapiens/mapview?chr failed to yield any more information in this regard, as most arm junctions within the alphoid contigs reported therein lacked highly homogeneous alpha satellite hors. examining the published sequences of entire human chromosomes also mostly failed to offer any additional useful information. the only two exceptions concerned chromosomes x  <cit>  and  <dig>  <cit> . the x and  <dig> array junctions contain  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb, respectively, and  <dig> ×  <dig> kb of highly homogeneous dxz <dig> and d8z <dig> hor sequences on the p and q arms. a clustalw alignment  of these repeats showed that the homogenisation processes acting on the two edges of dxz <dig> and d8z <dig> are independent, indicating that the two alpha satellite dna sequences do not exchange with each other at a distance.

we also identified one bac that contains a long insert of entirely assembled alpha satellite dna. it originates from chromosome  <dig> and had been sequenced and assembled in ncbi: bx <dig> . the assembly was confirmed by restriction digestion. it contains  <dig>  bp of contiguous alpha satellite dna. in silico restriction analysis revealed that its central part consists of  <dig> bp-long hors , whilst the two sides contain more divergent dna sequences. it thus corresponds to locus d1z <dig>  which had been previously characterised as generating  <dig>  kb dna fragments upon restriction by hind iii and as covering 100- <dig> kb  <cit> .

a clustalw alignment of the  <dig> repeats of its central section is shown in figure  <dig>  of the  <dig> positions within the entire hor,  <dig> correspond to diagnostic variant nucleotides , as defined in roizès  <cit> , as they are shared between at least  <dig> of the  <dig> copies. although their distribution appears to be rather complex, it is striking to note that repeats  <dig> to  <dig>  share common dvns, as do copies  <dig> to  <dig> , but that there is virtually no overlap between these two subsets. an intermediate subset  <dig>  is present between subsets  <dig> and  <dig>  with the two adjacent copies  <dig> and  <dig> being almost entirely identical and largely different from those of subsets  <dig> and  <dig>  sharing of dvns between subsets  <dig> and  <dig> is quite limited, indicating that their respective repeats exchange almost entirely within each subset. presumably, subset  <dig> constitutes an almost impassable barrier between subsets  <dig> and  <dig>  perhaps by rendering the repeats belonging to the flanking subsets too distant from each other.

the most likely explanation for these observations is that the copies of each subset have been homogenised and amplified by an accumulation of crossovers, creating homogeneous domains as postulated by roizès  <cit> . once such a domain has been formed, exchanges continue in the same mode, with adjacent repeats engaging in unequal crossing over and thereby creating new subdomains, as is visible in both subsets  <dig> and  <dig>  unequal crossing over is often accompanied by conversion events, or can alternatively be aborted and reduced to short conversion events. it is easy to infer from the respective sequences of the subsets that a complete unequal crossover together with conversion has generated this overall structure. further, one can note that there have been no more exchanges between subsets  <dig> and  <dig> since this original event occurred.

we can therefore conclude that the basic mechanism underlying the establishment of the structure encountered in this portion of the pericentromeric region of chromosome  <dig>  basically corresponds to that described in roizès  <cit> : an accumulation of unequal crossovers and the resulting creation of new alphoid domains by amplification and/or homogenisation. mitotic crossing-over events can only occur between repeats that are in close linear vicinity and are therefore almost identical in sequence. the domains are rather small and are in permanent evolution, both by the accumulation of unequal crossovers and by superimposed multilateral conversion events. this also supports our suggestion that conversion introduces divergence rather than homogeneity.

we next compared this first locus  to its orthologue on a chromosome  <dig> homologue from the hybrid cell line gm  <dig>  we proceeded using the approach described in roizès  <cit> : pcr and sequencing of a number of cloned repeats. however, we were only able to analyse a portion  of the  <dig> bp-long hor from gm  <dig>  and we did not know the relative positions of the repeats along the corresponding alphoid dna block. we first clustalw aligned the bx <dig> repeats corresponding to this reduced hor portion from gm  <dig>  in this case as well, the repeats were distributed in the same three distinct, non-overlapping subsets described above, although the copy order within each subset was not entirely the same. this allowed us to compare the copies present in the two homologues in a simultaneous clustalw alignment . the gm  <dig> repeats also exhibited short domains and subdomains comprised of copies bearing dvns, with most of them, but not all, being in common with those of bx <dig>  only a minority of the copies, however, share closely related haplotypes with those of bx <dig>  with most being largely unrelated. as above, this indicates that the two lineages bearing the two homologues  are engaged in continuous and independent homogenisation/amplification  and diversification  processes.

is the locus corresponding to bac bx <dig> an archetype of the evolutionary mechanisms operating within highly homogeneous alpha satellite arrays on all chromosomes?
as locus d1z <dig> appears to be more complex than those reported in roizès  <cit> , we decided to analyse other alphoid sequences as well, specifically those from chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> , and those shared by chromosomes  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> .

ninety-six cloned repeats from six chromosomes  <dig>  each isolated in a separate hybrid cell line, were sequenced, aligned, and compared to one another. the analysis was limited to a third of the chromosome  <dig> hor . the comparison confirmed that the repeats are much more homogeneous than those of the d1z <dig> locus corresponding to bac bx248407: the rate of sporadic mutations is very low , and the number of dvns is much lower than at the d1z <dig> locus. it was also difficult to identify conversion events, which would have added to the sequence diversity of the locus. a high proportion of the repeats from the six chromosomes  <dig> share identical haplotypes , which is also indicative of the relative stability of this locus compared to d1z <dig>  nevertheless, it appears that the dvns are only partially shared between the six homologues, indicating that the homologues correspond to chromosome lineages that were separated long ago and are now evolving independently.

chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> all exhibit strong signals at their respective centromeres in fish experiments using pz <dig>  as a probe, even at high stringency  <cit>  . the centromeric status of the corresponding loci  has also been confirmed by the binding of cenp-c to these alphoid arrays  <cit> . when we used bx <dig> dna as a probe with cot <dig> as a competitor, only chromosome  <dig> was labelled, confirming the arrangement of d1z <dig> and d1z <dig> shown in figure 4a.

an examination of the clustalw alignments of the cloned repeats corresponding to these loci revealed that the three chromosomes exhibit an organisation similar to locus d1z <dig>  albeit with different degrees of resemblance. this is exemplified by chromosome  <dig> , where several homogenisation runs superimposed on one another are clearly visible, similar to bx <dig>  b12b <dig> and d12d <dig> share a portion of their respective sequences, which could have resulted from a conversion event occurring during an aborted crossover event between the two copies. several multilateral conversion events are also easy to identify. overall,  <dig> dvns are detectable over the  <dig> nucleotides of the sequenced repeats, which is an even larger proportion than that observed at the d1z <dig> locus. this, together with a proportion of sporadic variation of about  <dig> %, reflects a high degree of exchange activity. the same holds true for chromosome  <dig>  where again  <dig> % of sporadic mutations were observed and which contains an even higher number of dvns  . the repeats of the two chromosomes are therefore engaged in a permanent turnover process based on an accumulation of crossover events, complete or aborted, associated with conversion events, as with the d1z <dig> locus of chromosome  <dig> 

in view of this permanent, ongoing process, it is easy to understand why, despite the almost identical consensus sequences of the hors of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> , numerous positions have been homogenised specifically within each chromosome. this can be observed when the two sets of repeats are clustalw analysed together, as they cluster separately .

repeats from two chromosome  <dig> homologues  were also compared. interestingly, they looked intermediate in terms of their diversity between chromosome  <dig> on the one hand and chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> on the other: the proportion of sporadic mutations was  <dig> %, and the number of dvns was much lower than in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  . a large renewal of the dvns has also occurred since the separation of the two lineages, indicative again of independent amplification/homogenisation runs.

four chromosome  <dig> homologues were also examined using the same approach. by clustalw alignment, it was possible to conclude that they are evolving according to the same rules as the other chromosomes analysed above .

what are the characteristics of the alphoid dna sequences associated with cenp-a within the centromere?
a small proportion of the repeats within a given homogeneous alphoid array are generally engaged in the functional centromere  <cit> . we decided to examine these particular repeats to determine if they exhibit sequence specificities and also to ask if they evolve as fast as the other repeats within the homogeneous array.

six hybrid cell lines, each containing a single chromosome  <dig>  were analysed. centromere-associated repeats were recovered after immunoprecipitation of chromatin using a cenp-a specific antibody. figure  <dig> shows the results of ipe1-ipe <dig> ; results for ipe4-ipe <dig> are shown in additional file  <dig>  the analysis revealed that these cenp-a associated repeats also apparently evolve by the same molecular mechanisms as most of the repeats of d21z <dig>  one can, in addition, observe a clear difference between the cenp-a associated repeats  and the bulk repeats  with respect to the distribution of dvns and their combinations in a large majority of the repeats. however, perhaps due to their very low variability, a significant minority of the ipe1- <dig> repeats shared the same haplotypes as e1- <dig>  so we could not firmly conclude that the subset of alphoid sequences involved in the formation of active centromeres is entirely different from the other repeats. finally, in both cases, the homogeneity is lower than in e1-e <dig> 

when chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were examined, it proved impossible to identify repeats exhibiting the same haplotypes in the two sets  within each chromosome, indicating that the repeats involved in the formation of the centromere only represent a very small percentage of the overall repeats; they do, however, follow the same type of evolution. moreover, the respective dvn distributions within the centromeric and pericentromeric repeats were clearly different. statistical analysis was not, however, performed on these sequences, as the size of the alphoid blocks was unknown and as it was impossible to determine whether the minority of repeats with the exact same sequence were independent or duplicate clones. this is illustrated by the two chromosome  <dig> homologues analysed in this study . the same holds true for chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> .

as the d1z <dig> locus could represent an archetypical structure for the homogeneous alphoid arrays analysed here, we next asked whether it was possible to recover alphoid repeats after chromatin immunoprecipitation with anti-cenp-a. to do this, we pcr amplified the dna repeats corresponding to d1z <dig> from the same sample of gm  <dig> that was used to obtain the repeats of d1z <dig>  where the centromere is known to form  <cit> . cenp-a associated repeats were indeed recovered, cloned, and sequenced. their clustalw alignment revealed the same type of pattern as their bulk counterparts, with less complexity and, hence, more homogeneity. it is noteworthy that, as shown by fish , d1z <dig> is present within d1z <dig>  <cit> .

this observation prompted us to investigate whether the same was true for chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  as they also share a second homogeneous alphoid array  <cit>  . to do this we again used the same dna samples obtained by chip that had been used to analyse the alphoid repeats specifically associated with d1z <dig>  and d5z <dig> . a pcr amplification assay with primers specific for this array revealed cenp-a associated repeats for chromosome  <dig>  but not for the two chromosomes  <dig> .

two previously described  <cit>  hybrid cell lines, each containing a single chromosome  <dig>  were also analysed with respect to their centromere-associated repeats. gm  <dig> exhibits hors which are 16- and 13-mers of the basic  <dig> bp alphoid unit, whilst gm  <dig> only has the 16-mer  <cit> . the cenp-a associated repeats were analysed by sequencing and clustalw alignment . again, the same properties were detected as described above.

although there is no such indication in the literature  <cit> , we tried to determine if a subtle sequence specificity of the alpha satellite repeats could contribute to the formation of nucleosomes using cenp-a as a substitute for histone h <dig>  it was difficult, for this purpose, to compare alphoid sequences belonging to different chromosomes, as their sequence differences are generally relatively high. this was not true, however, for chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  as they share almost identical consensus sequences at their respective loci where the centromere is formed . this allowed us to ask whether or not the centromeric repeats of each of these chromosomes share more dvns than do those of non-centromeric repeats. for this purpose, we aligned in a single clustalw analysis the sequenced repeats of the three chromosomes, including the two sets belonging to the two chromosome  <dig> homologues of this study, as they are evolutionarily independent. the centromere-associated subsets clearly resemble one another more than the other repeats do, as they are much more intermingled. this can be seen in the representation shown in figure  <dig>  in which the subsets of the cenp-a associated repeats  belonging to the four chromosomes are closer to each other in terms of diagnostic nucleotide variations than are those of their pericentromeric counterparts . we investigated whether this property was still observed when the dvns shared by at least 5% of the repeats were discarded because of their larger contribution to the clustalw alignment. this was still the case, possibly indicating that a greater degree of selection is acting on the centromere-associated repeats in comparison to the pericentromeric repeats, which would be freer to diverge.

the same did not hold true, however, when similar comparisons were made between e1- <dig> and ipe1- <dig> and between similar subsets of gm  <dig> and gm  <dig> from chromosome  <dig> . it is noteworthy, however, that both centromeric and pericentromeric alphoid repeats of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> have not yet reached the degree of divergence observed for chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> .

cenp-a is strongly associated with alpha satellite repeats containing the cenp-b box  <cit> . indeed, the alpha satellite arrays analysed here all exhibit such boxes. it was interesting to examine how the cenp-b nucleotides, which are essential for the binding of cenp-b proteins  <cit> , were affected by mutations and by their spreading to other repeats. in most cases, they were either completely unaffected or only rarely so, with the exception of those of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  especially in the repeats associated with cenp-a .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
we have previously suggested that alphoid arrays made of highly homogeneous hors evolve by homogenisation/amplification runs which differentiate them into a series of domains that bear almost identical haplotypes as defined by diagnostic variant nucleotides  <cit> . moreover, we showed that exchanges between homologues are essentially absent, with each homologue evolving within its particular lineage through the accumulation of unequal crossovers during germ line mitosis. conversion was viewed as primarily introducing divergence between the repeats.

in the present paper, we have revisited and extended these observations through the analysis of additional chromosomes . we have also examined how the repeats corresponding to the cenp-a nucleosomes of the centromere behave with respect to these evolutionary mechanisms.

the d1z <dig> locus is archetypical of the evolution of highly homogeneous alphoid arrays
we first examined the long stretch of alpha satellite dna from locus d1z <dig> , which was available in databases. knowing the map position of each repeat allowed us to confirm that the same observations could be made along its  <dig> homogeneous  <dig> bp-long tandem repeats, albeit with greater complexity than what was observed and predicted in our previous paper  <cit> . it is composed of two superimposed domains with relatively short subdomains, showing that the process of homogenisation/amplification acts at a high frequency and provides a somewhat constant flux through the generations. exchanges were almost absent between the two domains due to the presence of an impassable barrier separating them that was generated by the duplication of a relatively divergent repeat by unequal crossing over, thereby increasing the distance between the most proximal repeats.

when six chromosome  <dig> homologues were examined, we were able to confirm that the number of dvns was quite small. in contrast to our previous report, however, only a fraction of them was shared between the homologues, indicating that each chromosome  <dig> lineage "chooses" its dvns to be homogenised/amplified independently from the others. we cannot, however, conclude that this "choice" is totally random . a large minority of the copies shared the same haplotype, indicating that the d21z <dig> alpha satellite repeats have been relatively stable over time, or, alternatively and more likely, that the formation and fixation of this locus occurred relatively recently.

loci d1z <dig> and d19z <dig> from chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> exhibited clustalw alignment patterns that were similar to that of bac bx <dig> , with an even larger number of dvns. they are also comprised of domains and subdomains superimposed on one another and exhibit obvious conversion events. in the absence of a position map for the analysed repeats, however, it was difficult to determine whether the pairs of relatively diverged copies that are observable constitute, as with d1z <dig>  barriers between different domains. when the two chromosome  <dig> homologues were compared, the number of dvns was much lower, although it was still larger than that of the d21z <dig> locus. their dvn distributions were largely different, again showing independent homogenisation/amplification runs in the two corresponding lineages. they represent intermediate states of nucleotide variation and exchange between chromosome  <dig> and chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> 

an important property related to the molecular evolution of highly homogeneous alphoid arrays emerges from these analyses: all the chromosomes analysed to date are subjected to a constant flux of exchanges occurring during the series of mitoses in the germ line. this phenomenon probably takes place in each generation and is apparently an intrinsic property of the tandemly arranged highly homogeneous alphoid hors. given the differences in the extent of the phenomenon on different chromosomes, it is difficult to say if it depends on the particular chromosome involved or, more likely, on the amount of time that has elapsed since the formation of the homogeneous alphoid array.

the existence of several alphoid arrays coexisting within the centromeric regions of a number of chromosomes might be a consequence of this continuous process: with time, the divergence between the repeats has become so high in certain arrays that they are no longer capable of forming a centromere. beyond a certain level of divergence, the process of accumulation of unequal crossovers stops and they drift, ultimately becoming monomeric. this model fits well with the observation made by schueler et al  <cit>  that the monomeric alphoid arrays present on xp are ancestral to the highly homogeneous block where the centromere is formed  <cit> . the same is true of chromosome  <dig>  <cit> .

which status for the repeats associated with cenp-a?
we wanted to investigate the evolutionary behaviour of the minority of repeats that are engaged in the actual centromere. alphoid homogeneous arrays can be very small, as on chromosome  <dig> where the array can be less than  <dig> kb long  <cit> . it was not surprising, therefore, that on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  almost no repeats representative of those associated with cenp-a were detected in the bulk set of repeats. this confirmed that the proportion of alphoid repeats from a homogeneous array that is engaged in the real centromere can be very low. the overall features of these repeats were shown, however, to be similar to those exhibited by the bulk repeats. they are therefore evolving in the same way.

the sizes of the domains and subdomains they exhibit could not be estimated at present, but if they are similar to those that are supposed to exist within the pericentromeric alphoid repeats such as within bx <dig>  they would be compatible with the interspersed structure of human cenp-a and histone h <dig> nucleosomes  <cit> . the most striking feature of this analysis is that the dvns that the cenp-a associated repeats have "chosen" for homogenisation/amplification are quite distinct from the other repeats. these small sequence differences might reflect a certain degree of sequence dependence for the recruitment of the proteins that constitute the cenp-a centromeric nucleosome-associated complex  <cit> . at the same time, when several homologues were examined the dvns exhibited by these repeats  were largely different, consistent with an absence of a strict sequence dependence for cenp-a to bind directly to alpha satellites, as reported by conde e silva et al  <cit> .

a more plausible explanation for this difference in dvns could be that during the constant process of change that supposedly leads to the loss of the capacity of the alphoid repeats to form an active centromere, certain nucleotide changes do not spread at the same rate within the cenp-a associated repeats. alternatively, during the proposed centromere meiotic drive  <cit> , some haplotypes could be actively selected against to preserve the centromere integrity of the unique remaining cell that is available for fertilization during female meiosis ii.

the comparison carried out between chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which share almost identical consensus sequences at their respective centromeric loci, supports this hypothesis. the dvns of repeats originating from the three chromosomes were shared in higher proportions when associated with cenp-a than when recovered from the bulk. this was shown by simultaneous clustalw alignments of the repeats of the four chromosomes tested . we cannot, however, conclude from this analysis that the dna sequence of the centromere-associated repeats is an important factor in its formation, even though is it possible to suggest that there are constraints upon the nucleotide variations that occur in this portion of an alphoid array.

the cenp-a associated alphoid repeats may be found in unrelated alphoid arrays of the same chromosome
another unexpected observation of this study was that repeats associated with cenp-a were detected on both chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> on two unrelated but contiguous homogeneous arrays of alpha satellite dna. this was not the case, however, for the two chromosome  <dig> homologues. this observation raises the possibility that centromeres can be formed by repeats originating from different alphoid arrays, provided that they are homogeneous enough. another possibility is that there is an alternative centromere location on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  as has been shown in one robertsonian fusion  <cit> ; most fusions of this kind contain dicentric chromosomes with one of the two centromeres being inactivated. interestingly, sullivan and willard  <cit>  have described stable dicentric human x chromosomes in which the distance between the two functional centromeres is relatively small - as apparently is the case in the two chromosomes described here - thereby preventing anaphase bridge formation, chromosome breakage, and chromosome loss. it is noteworthy that in the case of the d1z <dig> locus of chromosome  <dig>  one of the two series of potential cenp-b boxes has been almost totally destroyed by mutation, whilst d1z <dig> exhibits cenp-b boxes in their integrity, which could help this locus recruit cenp-a proteins  <cit> .

a model for the formation and maintenance of active human centromeres
with the above observations in mind, it is possible to make some suggestions and predictions concerning the formation and evolution of human centromeres at alpha satellite loci, where they are mostly found .

it has been previously pointed out that the alphoid repeats that are capable of contributing to an active centromere must be part of an extremely homogeneous higher-order multimeric repeat unit array that is uninterrupted by retrotransposons  <cit> . they are submitted to continuous nucleotide changes which spread at high rates to adjacent repeats. this constitutes a progressive process that probably depends on the amount of time that has elapsed since the homogeneous array was formed. this fits well with the differences found between chromosome  <dig> on the one hand and chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> on the other, with chromosome  <dig> being intermediate between them with respect to both the number of detected dvns and the proportion of sporadic mutations.

when a highly homogeneous array has been created, a functional centromere can be formed. this is clearly possible with a large variety of alpha satellite dna sequences, since most chromosomes exhibit largely divergent ones. the intrinsic ability of highly homogeneous multimeric tandem repeats to homogenise/amplify by accumulating unequal crossovers continues to act upon repeats that are almost identical. this identity is slowly undermined by the accumulation of random mutations, but as long as domains compatible with the formation of an active centromere exist, the array continues to play its functional role. in this study, this is the case with d21z <dig> and d5z <dig>  which have not yet accumulated enough divergence to affect this compatibility, in contrast to chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  in which cenp-a associated higher-order alphoid repeat units have been recovered in a second homogeneous alphoid array.

we do not know, however, if these repeats are part of the active centromere or if they are part of a potential alternative centromere that is in the process of being formed. this might represent a general way of ensuring the stability of human chromosomes over time, as an alternative to the exceptional possibility of being rescued through neocentromere formation. significantly, five chromosomes with neocentromeres have been described in which the alphoid array within which the centromere is normally formed is still present, three on chromosome y, one on chromosome  <dig>  and one on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . it is interesting to note that there is apparently only one alphoid array in each of these three chromosomes, meaning that there is no possibility for a centromere to form within another array if the unique one loses its capacity to bind the cenp-a centromeric nucleosome associated complex. the number of neocentromere-containing chromosomes reported to date could be largely underestimated because they are not associated with clinical defects, in contrast to those in which the alphoid sequences have been lost  <cit> . the defects of the old inactivated centromeres have not been characterized, although it has been suggested that there might have been a partial deletion of the alphoid dna, which seems unlikely if one refers to the extreme variations of alpha satellite dna found in normal chromosomes  <cit> . we rather think that the normal destiny of a centromere is to be lost over time and to be replaced by a new one, most often within the same alphoid array or in a second one, with neocentromeres of the above type representing in this case a transient possible way to rescue a chromosome with an impaired centromere  <cit> .
