BACKGROUND
one of the iconic narratives in evolutionary biology is that associations between insects such as beetles, moths, flies and bees and flowering plants have resulted in an intricate nexus of coevolution between diversifying angiosperms and their insect pollinator clades from the mid cretaceous to the present  <cit> . in  <dig>  ren et al. reported eleven species in mesopsychidae, aneuretopsychidae and pseudopolycentropodidae with siphonate proboscides. the authors suggested that these mecopteran siphonate proboscides were used to feed on liquid pollination drops of gymnospermous reproductive structures and likely engaged in pollination mutualisms with gymnosperms during the mid-mesozoic, long before the similar and independent establishment of coevolutionary associations between nectar-feeding bees, flies, moths, and beetles on angiosperms  <cit> . recently, peñalver et al. described two zhangsolvid flies from late cretaceous amber in spain at 105 ma  and myanmar at 100 ma that possess long proboscides. the spanish specimen retained gymnosperm pollen adhering to the surface of its abdomen, thus providing evidence that these insects were engaged in pollination mutualisms with gymnosperms  <cit> .

mecoptera is a small order of insects comprising nine extant families  <cit>  that contrasts with their greater diversity during the mesozoic, encompassing about  <dig> extinct families and  <dig> genera described to date  <cit> . within mecoptera, mesopsychidae tillyard,  <dig>  are a small extinct family, and together with three other families, aneuretopsychidae  <cit> , pseudopolycentropodidae  <cit> , and nedubroviidae  <cit> , form a major clade of basal mecoptera, the aneuretopsychina  <cit> , which have elongate, siphonate proboscides, feeding on pollination drops of gymnosperms  <cit> . phylogenetic relationships among mesopsychidae and other mecopteran-related families, including extinct basal panorpoids, extinct basal mecopterans and extant mecopterans previously have been reported  <cit> . currently, eleven genera with  <dig> species from the upper permian to the mid lower cretaceous have been assigned to mesopsychidae , which are summarized in table  <dig>  fossil mesopsychids are known from australia, kyrgyzstan, south africa, ukraine, tajikistan, russia and china.table  <dig> summary of all described genera and species of mesopsychidae

recently, we collected ten new specimens of mesopsychids from the latest middle jurassic jiulongshan formation at daohugou village, shantou township, from ningcheng county of inner mongolia in northeastern china. based on these occurrences, two new species – lichnomesopsyche prochorista sp. nov. and vitimopsyche pristina sp. nov. – are described. in addition, the diagnosis of lichnomesopsyche daohugouensis ren, labandeira and shih,  <dig>  is revised based on five, well-preserved, new specimens of l. daohugouensis that display additional species-diagnostic characters of the hind wings which were lacking in the holotype  <cit> .

vitimopsyche torta was reported by novokshonov in  <dig> from the lower cretaceous zaza formation at baissa, in transbaikalian russia  <cit> . currently, two species, v. torta and v. kozlovi, have been assigned to vitimopsyche, and both were described from the lower cretaceous. in this report, we describe a new species of vitimopsyche from latest middle jurassic strata. this new find suggests that this genus has existed at least from the latest middle jurassic to the mid lower cretaceous and has had minimal morphological change for  <dig> million years .

based on data from previously described, representative species and two new species erected herein, a suite of unique characters were chosen for phylogenetic analyses to shed light on the taxonomy, classification and phylogeny of the genera within mesopsychidae. in addition, geometric morphometric analyses  for specimens with well-preserved forewings were conducted to supplement the phylogenetic analyses. geometric morphometric analyses have been used in the study of phenetic relationships  among extant and fossil insects and their associations with cycadophyte, ginkgophyte and other land plants . the results from these two methods provide a preliminary understanding of the phylogenetic and phenetic relationships of selected genera of mesopsychidae.

methods
examined taxa and terminology
the specimens described herein are housed in the fossil insect collection of the key laboratory of insect evolution and environmental changes, college of life sciences, capital normal university, beijing, china . the specimens were examined using a leica mz  <dig>  dissecting microscope connected to a leica dfc <dig> digital camera, and illustrated with the aid of a drawing tube attached to the microscope. photographs of entire specimens were taken with a nikon d <dig> digital camera coupled to a nikkor 65 mm macro lens. the overlay drawings were prepared by using adobe illustrator cs <dig> and adobe photoshop cs <dig> graphics software. the wing venational nomenclature is based on novokshonov   <cit> .

measurements and corresponding abbreviations
body lengths were measured from the apex of the head, excluding antennae and proboscis, to the apex of the abdomen, excluding appendages. the wing lengths were measured from the base to the apex of wings. the lengths of the antennae were measured from their base to apex. corresponding text and figure abbreviations are: sc, subcosta; r <dig>  first branch of the radius; rs, radial sector; ma, anterior media; mp, posterior media; cua, anterior cubitus; cup, posterior cubitus; 1a, first branch of the anal vein; 2a, second branch of the anal vein.

phylogenetic analysis
we conducted phylogenetic analyses to elucidate the taxonomic and phylogenetic positions of the two new species and clarify the genus-level relationships of mesopsychidae. because many reported fossils lack well-preserved features of the body, only two body characters  were used in this study . the other  <dig> are wing characters; characters 0– <dig> are forewing characters , and character  <dig> is a hind wing character. the character selection partly is attributable to the characters used by ren et al.,  <dig>  <cit>  in their phylogenetic analysis of the aneuretopsychina, or those scorpionflies characterized by siphonate, proboscate mouthparts. thirteen mesopsychid species representing five genera with almost completely preserved forewing characters were selected as ingroups for the analysis . described species with missing or poorly-preserved characters or possessing unusually inconsistent characters were excluded but summarized in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  with reasons for exclusion. mesopsyche is represented by m. triareolata, m. shcherbakovi and m. dobrokhotae, but seven other species were excluded. mesopanorpodes wianamattensis tillyard,  <dig> and baissopsyche pura novokshonov and sukacheva,  <dig>  were also excluded. three fossil species, permopanorpa inaequalis tillyard,  <dig>   <cit> , protopanorpa longicubitalis bashkuev,  <dig>   <cit> , and pseudopolycentropus janeannae ren, labandeira and shih,  <dig>   <cit>  were selected as outgroups for the analysis . the outgroup selection was based on the phylogeny of basal panorpids in grimaldi and engel,  <dig>  <cit> , and the phylogeny of aneuretopsychina  <cit>  showing their relation to basal panorpids and extant mecopterans. we chose the type genus, permopanorpa, of permopanorpidae as the root of the tree, because it is more basal than all other families in aneuretopsychina. the character-state matrix, consisting of  <dig> taxa and  <dig> morphological characters with two or more character-states. this matrix is provided in table  <dig> table  <dig> definition of characters and their states

the “?” denotes that the state is unknown or is inapplicable



the character-state matrix was entered into winclada   <cit> , a morphological analysis software program. tree searches implemented a heuristic search method, with options set to hold  <dig>  trees,  <dig> replications,  <dig> starting tree replication, and a multiple tbr + tbr search strategy. all characters were treated as unordered and were weighted equally. missing or inapplicable characters were coded with question marks. parsimony analyses were performed by using nona   <cit>  and paup   <cit> . we conducted both parsimony versions because only one outgroup can be defined in the nona but three outgroups are identified in paup, resulting in different heuristic searches used in these two programs.

for nona, we use an exhaustive search option and bootstrap support values from  <dig> replications are presented as numbers under branch nodes. for paup, the same matrix editing program was used, nexus data editor , and the nex file was entered into paup which employs a general heuristic search with  <dig> replicates and tbr branch swapping. all characters were treated as unordered and equally weighted.

geometric morphometric analysis of forewings
we began our analyses by obtaining and compiling completed forewing samples from the literature, and then chose landmarks to identify their wing shape, relative positions of the branching points, and number of branches. the specimens, the same as those of the phylogenetic analyses, comprise  <dig> ingroups and three outgroups.

we used adobe photoshop cs <dig> and adobe illustrator cs <dig> to re-draw the venation of the  <dig> ingroups and three outgroups based on line drawings published in the literature , with minor modifications and assumptions noted in the fig.  <dig> caption. the drawings were entered into tps-utils  <cit>  to convert the jpeg files into tps files for further use. for the first set of analysis,  <dig> landmarks were placed using tps-dig  <cit>  on positions of key veins on the wings, four examples of which are shown in fig. 2a–d. compared to the venation of vitimopsyche pristina sp. nov. , the outgroup permopanorpa inaequalis  has an extra rs, two extra ma veins, and two extra mp veins and protopanorpa longicubitalis  has an extra rs and three extra mp veins, while the outgroup pseudopolycentropus janeannae  and the ingroup e. pentavenulosa  have an extra mp vein. to accommodate these additional veins, we applied additional landmarks to each extra vein for representation . for all other wings that lack these extra veins, we simply doubled or occasionally tripled the number of landmarks as shown in fig. 2a. a consensus was calculated by using all  <dig> samples and  <dig> landmarks in tps-super  <cit> . later, using the consensus as the “reference” and all sixteen samples as the “data”, we used tps-splin  <cit>  to calculate the procrustes distances  <cit> . we converted the data into nts files to complete the final step in ntedit where a matrix was produced and labeled. we entered this matrix into ntsyspc  <cit> , where we used an unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages  to produce the first known tree showing the phenetic relationships among these  <dig> scorpionfly wing samples based on  <dig> landmarks.fig.  <dig> line drawings of forewing samples for  <dig> representative species used in analyses. a

to conduct a more detailed analysis, we ran the above program again by adding positions of two crossveins with  <dig> landmarks . because e. pentavenulosa does not have any of these crossveins, we decided to exclude this taxon from this set of analyses. the  <dig> images of  <dig> ingroups and three outgroups subsequently were entered into tps-utils, marked in tps-dig, averaged in tps-super, calculated in tps-splin, and transferred to the second tree in ntsyspc, using the same procedures mentioned above.fig.  <dig> the landmark numbers of the four forewing samples for the case of  <dig> landmarks. a

urn: lsid:zoobank.org:act:0c5a060a-9314-4752-94fe-35b65b18a132

diagnosis
the new species resembles lichnomesopsyche gloriae and l. daohugouensis in venational features, but differs from both by rs forking proximal of the ma bifurcation on the fore- and hind wings. it also differs from l. daohugouensis by not having spots on the fore- and hind wings.

etymology
the specific name is a combination of latin “pro-”  and the greek “choristos” , indicating that the forking of rs vein is proximal of the ma vein bifurcation.

results of phylogenetic analysis
the maximum parsimony analysis by nona yielded only one most parsimonious tree  =  <dig> , retention index  =  <dig> ). morphological characters were optimized with parsimony on the most parsimonious tree, showing only unambiguous changes. the bootstrap value results are shown in fig. 11a.fig.  <dig> results of phylogenetic analyses . a the most parsimonious tree with bootstrap support by nona. b the consensus tree by paup. white circles indicate homoplasious characters, and the black circles indicate non-homoplasious characters. the numbers above branches are character numbers, below branches are character states, and the red numbers below the branches are bootstrap values in 



the analysis by paup produced two most parsimonious trees , and the consensus tree is shown in fig. 11b . two characters are uninformative , but we did not exclude them in our analyses because they provide additional information for individual tree branches. there are  <dig> parsimony-informative characters.

the monophyly of the mesopsychidae is supported by three synapomorphic characters . they are: 1), the forewing rs + ma vein forks from the r <dig> vein far distal to the mp vein that originates from cua ; 2), the forewing cup vein occurs almost at the same level or distal to mid-length of the wing ; and 3), the anal area is expanded on the forewing . one of the basalmost taxa of the mesopsychidae is epicharmesopsyche, whose sister-group relationship with other species of the ingroups is supported by one synapomorphic character, namely that the antennae is short and filiform . the basal position of epicharmesopsyche is indirectly determined, as this genus possesses one described species and is monotypic.

the monophyly of vitimopsyche is supported by two synapomorphic characters. the first feature is the forewing mp forking distal to the rs + ma bifurcation . the second character is the forewing crossvein mp2-mp <dig> occurring considerably distal to the mp <dig> +  <dig> bifurcation point . the systematic position of the new species, vitimopsyche pristina sp. nov., also is confirmed by the one synapomorphic character of the hind wing sc vein of medium length that is present slightly proximal to the ma vein bifurcation .

the monophyly of lichnomesopsyche is supported by one unambiguous character: the forking of the mp and rs + ma veins very close to or at the same level in the forewing . in addition, there are two non-homologous characters of: 1) a rs + ma bifurcation from the r <dig> vein present slightly distal to where the mp vein originates from the cua vein ; and 2) the forewing cup-cua crossvein is far distal to the mp vein and originates from the cua vein . these features render the three species of lichnomesopsyche, including lichnomesopsyche prochorista sp. nov., as forming one clade equivalent to a genus.

mesopsyche, in contrast, is a paraphyletic group, as the three species are scattered across the phylogenetic tree. the sister group of mesopsyche triareolata is supported by two homologous characters: 1) absence of a crossvein between r <dig> and c ; and 2) the posterior margin of the forewings bearing an emargination at the cup vein apex . the basal position of mesopsyche triareolata clade, however, is only indirectly determined. the clade of mesopsyche shcherbakovi and its sister group is supported by one synapomorphic character, the mp1 +  <dig> forking is proximal to the ma forking in the forewing . we suggest revising the taxonomy of these two species, pending future discovery and study of additional new specimens.

mesopsyche dobrokhotovae exhibits close affinity to species of permopsyche, particularly in that the base of the cua vein is oblique to transverse and not inclined backwards  <cit> . mesopsyche dobrokhotovae mainly conforms to the character of permopsyche. the systematic position of mesopsyche dobrokhotovae should be revised, a conclusion confirmed by one synapomorphic character, the forewing sc fore-branch  vein ending at a point proximal to the 1a vein terminus . consequently, we propose to transfer mesopsyche dobrokhotovae to the genus permopsyche, as permopsyche dobrokhotovae  comb. nov. three species of permopsyche and mesopsyche dobrokhotovae are shown as a sister clade to lichnomesopsyche. it is interesting to note the geochronologically wide age distinctions among these species, ranging from the late permian to middle jurassic.

the resulting consensus tree by paup  is very similar to the tree by nona . only two differences are present. one distinction is the relationship among the three outgroups. the results from nona exhibits a closer relationship of pseudopolycentropus janeannae and the ingroups, whereas the result by paup shows a parallel relationship of three outgroups and an ingroup. the other feature resolved by nona is the interspecies relationship of the two genera, lichnomesopsyche and permopsyche, which was not resolved by paup.

based on the two phylogenetic analyses, mesopsychidae is a monophyletic group; in addition, two of its genera, vitimopsyche and lichnomesopsyche, also are monophyletic . permopsyche and mesopsyche are paraphyletic. epicharmesopsyche is a monotypic species. although the relationships among the genera are incompletely resolved, we have carried out a geometric morphometric analyses to supplement the results of our phylogenetic analyses.

results of geometric morphometric analysis of forewings
for the first study, a forewing geometric analysis consisted of  <dig> ingroups, three outgroups,  <dig> landmarks, but no crossvein characters. an unweighted pair-group method that employs arithmetic averages  produced tree  <dig> . the results of this study show the phenetic relationships without consideration of evolutionary relationships among the sixteen scorpionfly wing samples. a second study consisted of twelve ingroups and three outgroups, using  <dig> landmarks and two crossvein characters that produced tree  <dig> .fig.  <dig> resulting trees for the geometric morphometric analyses. a tree  <dig> for  <dig> landmarks . b tree  <dig> for  <dig> landmarks 



from the resulting geometric morphometric trees  <dig> and  <dig> , which are nearly congruent, we obtain the following five conclusions. first, lichnomesopsyche prochorista sp. nov. has wing venation most similar to those of the other two species of the genus lichnomesopsyche. second, vitimopsyche pristina sp. nov. has wing venation most similar to those of the two other species of the genus vitimopsyche. third, the group containing three species of permopsyche and m. dobrokhotovae has very similar wing venation, which is different from that of the genus lichnomesopsyche and other taxa in mesopsychidae. fourth, the venation of m. triareolata and m. shcherbakovi are unique and distinct from other taxa or groups of mesopsychidae. fifth, epicharmesopsyche pentavenulosa is a unique taxon with venation different from all other ingroups of mesopsychidae, shown in tree  <dig> .

the result of the geometric morphometric analyses also indicates that mesopsyche is not monophyletic, and that mesopsyche dobrokhotovae has an affinity with species of permopsyche. this is consistent with the results of our phylogenetic analyses and with comparisons of the original description, line drawings, and photographs. as a result, we further validate our proposal for transferal of mesopsyche dobrokhotovae to permopsyche dobrokhotovae  comb. nov.  <cit> , and consider that the taxonomic positions of the other two species should be revised, pending availability of new specimens and additional study. based on current information, it is hypothesized that the geochronologic longevity and geographic distribution of permopsyche extended from the upper permian of russia and australia to the upper triassic of the ukraine  <cit> .

discussion
taxonomy and phylogeny of mesopsychidae
although most of the examined specimens have preserved wings rich in structural characters, due to limited number of fossil specimens described, this study is the first attempt to compile data and conduct phylogenetic and geometric morphometric analyses based on previously described and new species. these phylogenetic results support the hypothesis that mesopsychidae is a monophyletic group. the systematic positions of the two newly described species, l. prochorista sp. nov. and v. pristina sp. nov. are validated. vitimopsyche pristina sp. nov. represents the earliest fossil record of the genus vitimopsyche, thus, extending the genus from the lower cretaceous to the latest middle jurassic. based on our phylogenetic and geometric morphometric analyses, we propose erection of the taxon permopsyche dobrokhotovae  comb. nov., and suggest a taxonomic revision of the two other species of mesopsyche in the future.

comparison of phylogenetic and geometric morphometric analyses
for a better perspective regarding relationships among representative genera and species of mesopsychidae, we applied two methods for analyses of the same specimens. both approaches were useful for understanding the intergeneric relationships among taxa and to infer the systematic positions of the two new species. in the phylogenetic analysis, many morphological characteristics were chosen, including abundant characters of the forewing, and a few characters of the hind wing and body. by comparison, the geometric morphometric analyses only employed forewing landmarks. the character states of phylogenetic analyses are discrete states, but landmark analysis used in geometric morphometric analyses allow for continuous changes of a particular landmark character. because many landmarks occur on the wing margin, the geometric morphometric analyses include comparisons of wing shapes  <cit> , which is not part of the phylogenetic analysis. alternatively, character states of phylogenetic analyses allow some missing character data, which frequently occur for fossil specimens. the geometric morphometric analyses do not allow for missing landmarks, unless they are added by invoking assumptions. consequently, both methodologies, based on the same set of specimens, complement each other to provide a better understanding of the phylogenetic and phenetic relationships among these specimens.

the resulting trees from the two methods exhibit a fundamental consistency and similarity, but, with two obvious differences as shown in additional file 5: figure s5: the first distinction is the varying placement of mesopsyche triareolata. in the tree shown in additional file 5: figure s5b, mesopsyche triareolata and the species of lichnomesopsyche are in one clade, whereas in the phylogenetic tree in additional file 5: figure s5a, m. triareolata and the rest of ingroup species are sister groups. the second distinction is that the sister groups of epicharmesopsyche pentavenulosa are different. as mentioned previously, the most basal position of mesopsyche triareolata is indirectly supported by its sister group, which are represented by five landmarks:  <dig> vs.  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> vs.  <dig>  since geometric morphometric analyses treat all landmarks equally and without weighting, the positions of other landmarks, such as  <dig> landmarks for tree  <dig>  and  <dig> for tree  <dig> , seem to have more of a significant impact on relative venational similarity and the phenetic placement of m. triareolata in trees  <dig> and  <dig> 

origin and early evolution of the mesopsychid siphonate proboscis
the phylogenetic analysis of mesopsychidae sheds light on the origin of the siphonate proboscis and in its closest related family, the pseudopolycentropodidae. the second most basal mesopsychidae, epicharmesopsyche pentavenulosa, apparently lacked a proboscis  <cit> , although the mouthpart condition of the two outgroups, permopanorpa inaequalis, protopanorpa longicubitalis and mesopsyche triareolata, the most basal mesopsychid, remain unknown. additionally, the proboscis of pseudopolycentropodidae is structurally very different from that of the mesopsychidae  <cit> . consequently, it appears that the proboscis was evolved independently in the pseudopolycentropodidae, also in the vitimopsyche and possibly in the lichnomesopsyche clades of the mesopsychidae. nevertheless, the mouthpart conditions of the intervening mesopsyche shcherbakovi and the species of permopsyche, the sister clade to lichnomesopsyche, remain unknown. more broadly, within late paleozoic to mid mesozoic mecoptera, the nedubroviidae  <cit>  and aneuretopsychidae  <cit>  also have long-proboscid, siphonate mouthparts. this suggests that the long-proboscid condition might independently have originated four or possibly five  times within early mecoptera.

the pattern of the origin of the siphonate proboscis four or five times in mecoptera contrasts dramatically with that of lepidoptera in which evidence indicates a single origination event for a considerably more diverse clade  <cit> . another significant difference is that the lepidopteran proboscis is derived from paired maxillary galeae  <cit> , whereas the mecopteran proboscis consists of paired labial elements. unlike lepidopterans, the construction of the mecopteran’s labially derived proboscis is based on elongation of paired labial elements such as glossae or palps that are conjoined to anatomically form the siphon for the imbibition of fluids  <cit> . the origin of the mecopteran proboscis likely has an evolutionary developmental explanation. smith and jockusch  <cit>  recently have documented such a transformation in embryonic mouthpart development in the beetle, tribolium castaneum, which has well developed, chewing, mandibulate mouthparts. in t. castaneum the specificity functions of the genes extradenticle  and homothorax  were subject to gene knockdown, providing interference rna  phenotypes. the resulting adult mouthpart malformations of this mandibulate insect included modifications of the maxillary and labial regions. the maxillary region displayed enlargement of some elements, transformation of proximal structures to more distal identity, and inter-element fusions, though not formation of the anatomical precursor to siphonate mouthparts.

by contrast, the adult labium in t. castaneum underwent a major structural transformation that could represent the initial stages of a siphonate proboscis . upon knockdown of the ext and hth genes by rnai treatment, there was: 1) a change of more proximal element regions to a more distal identity, 2) a narrowing of the prementum and mentum basal regions; 3) elongation of the palpiger sclerite that bears the labial palps, and most significantly, 4) deletion of the ligula and most of the prementum occurring between the labial palps, and 5) reduction and medial fusion of the labial palps into a single, somewhat prolonged structure  <cit> . other knockdown genes, such as proboscipedia , instead resulted in transformation of the labial palpi into a leg-like structures, indicating that it is the ext and hth genes in t. castaneum that largely is responsible for alteration of nominal mandibulate mouthparts into an incipiently siphonate condition. it is unclear if the medially conjoined labial structure was tubular in nature, or if it had any connection to an anatomical mouth. repeated rounds of suppression of ext and hth genes could explain initial stages of the proboscis origin among early mecoptera.fig.  <dig> an adult mouthpart phenotype with medial fusion of labial palps in tribolium castaneum resulting from larval rnai knockdown of the genes homothorax  and extradenticle . the example represents a more severe case in the transformation of the loss of labial glossa and paraglossal elements, significant size reduction of the mentum  and prementum, and fusion of the labial palps into a single medial structure. abbreviations for maxillary elements are: crd, cardo; stp, stipes; plf, palpiger; lac, lacinia; and gal, galea. abbreviations for labium are: plg, paliger, lp <dig> labial palp segment  <dig>  this figure was redrawn from fig. 1p of smith and jockusch   <cit> 



CONCLUSIONS
phylogenetic results support that mesopsychidae is a monophyletic group. the systematic positions of l. prochorista sp. nov. and v. pristina sp. nov. are confirmed as belonging, respectively, to the lichnomesopsyche and vitimopsyche lineages. the existence of vitimopsyche pristina sp. nov. extends this genus from the lower cretaceous to the latest middle jurassic. based on our phylogenetic analyses and geometric morphometric analyses, we propose to transfer mesopsyche dobrokhotovae to permopsyche, and suggest revising the taxonomy of the other two species, pending the discovery and study of new specimens. in addition, tree topology supports the origin of the siphonate proboscis in the common ancestor to the vitimopsyche and lichnomesopsyche clades, possibly in an independent fashion, and siphon loss in epicharmesopsyche. it is suggested that the long-proboscid condition may have independently originated up to five times within early mecoptera, namely nedubroviidae, aneuretopsychidae, pseudopolycentropodidae and mesopsychidae, with possible separate originations in vitimopsyche and lichnomesopsyche. it is hypothesized that repeated rounds of suppression of ext and hth genes could explain initial stages of the proboscis origin among early mecoptera. future phylogenetic and geometric morphometric studies, and new mouthpart examinations of additional fossil specimens and better preserved material will augment understanding of the origin, evolution and phylogeny of mesopsychidae and their siphonate proboscides.
