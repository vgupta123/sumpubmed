BACKGROUND
various defense responses are induced when a pathogen attempts to invade a non-host plant or resistant host. among these induced responses the hypersensitive response  is the most distinguishing hallmark of resistance and is characterized by rapid localized plant cell death at the site of infection  <cit> . the hr generates a physical barrier composed of dead cells and limits the availability of nutrients to the pathogen which can further restrict its spread. other defense related responses often accompany hr, such as oxidative burst  <cit> , the production of antimicrobial compounds   <cit> , pathogenesis related proteins  <cit> , and enzymes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway  <cit> .

the ability of some gram negative bacterial pathogens, such as erwinia, pseudomonas, xanthomonas and ralstonia strains, to cause disease in susceptible plants and elicit hr in resistant or non-host plants is governed by the hrp gene cluster  <cit> . these genes encode components of a type iii secretion system involved in the secretion of effectors proteins  <cit> . these secretion pathways are used to deliver proteins from bacterial cytoplasm either to the culture media or into the host cell cytoplasm  <cit> . one of these bacteria, erwinia amylovora), causes a bacteriosis, called fire blight, in species belonging to the subfamily maloideae of the family rosaceae, including apple , pear  and ornamentals such as cotoneaster and pyracantha. fire blight has been known as a destructive disease of apple and pear for over  <dig> years  <cit> . extensive information is available about the disease, including epidemiology, susceptibility of host genotypes  <cit>  and in particular, the pathogen e. amylovora  <cit> . however, the biochemical and genetic basis leading to the disease or the establishment of resistance in the host plant are still relatively unknown. indeed, as opposed to a number of other plant pathogen interactions, no specific r/avr gene-for-gene interactions have been described in relation to fire blight. this suggests that the resistance could be under polygenic control. although no resistance mechanism to e. amylovora in host plants has yet been characterized, recent work has identified some molecular events which occur in resistant and/or susceptible host interaction with e. amylovora: i) massive oxidative stress is induced by e. amylovora with similar kinetics and magnitude as with an incompatible pathogen, regardless of the infected host genotype  <cit> , and this elicitation requires both pathogenicity factors, hrpn and dspa/e, of e. amylovora  <cit> ; ii) some specific defense pathways, in particular specific branches of phenylpropanoid pathway leading to phytoalexin synthesis, are suppressed in the susceptible host by e. amylovora, whereas they are induced in the resistant host <cit> ; iii) hrp-independent defense responses that could be effective in stopping an infection of e. amylovora are delayed in susceptible hosts  <cit> ; and iv) three pathogenesis-related  genes of apple, pr- <dig>  pr- <dig> and pr- <dig>  are also induced in response to inoculation with e. amylovora  <cit> . additionally, infection of apple by e. amylovora results in decreased photosynthetic efficiency. forty-eight hours after inoculation with e. amylovora photosynthetic rates are reduced in both mature and young apple leaves measured under ambient co <dig>  whereas under saturating co <dig> the photosynthetic rate is reduced only in young infected leaves; suggesting an inhibition of photosystem  ii in both infected mature and young leaves and an inhibition of ps i only in infected young leaves  <cit> . similarly, changes are observed in the chlorophyll fluorescence of e. amylovora-challenged apple leaves prior to the development of disease symptoms  <cit> .

earlier molecular investigations of the e. amylovora- malus interaction have been limited to a restricted number of plant defenses previously characterized in other plant-pathogen interactions. to identify genes implicated in the control of fire blight resistance, we have chosen to use the rna fingerprinting technique of cdna amplified fragment length polymorphism   <cit> . this technique was applied to study the genes differentially regulated in susceptible 'm.26'  and resistant geneva 'g.41'  apple rootstocks  <cit>  following challenge with a virulent strain of e. amylovora  or buffer. gene expression was studied  <dig> and  <dig> hours after inoculation of the leaves by wounding. the purpose of this study was to understand the mechanisms of interaction between malus and e. amylovora in resistant and susceptible apple cultivars. the results will aid in the design of new strategies to improve apple resistance to e. amylovora, and facilitate development of molecular tools for marker-assisted selection.

RESULTS
to elucidate the molecular and biochemical mechanisms involved in resistance and susceptibility of apple trees to e. amylovora, a comparison of gene expression patterns between the resistant apple rootstock 'g.41' and the susceptible 'm.26' was carried out using cdna-aflp-analysis at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi. these time points were selected based upon previous analysis of the temporal transcriptional response of malus to e. amylovora  <cit> which indicated that basal defense to pathogen associated molecular patterns  occurred within 1- <dig> hpi whereas expression of pr proteins occurred 24- <dig> hpi.

cdna templates were prepared from leaves inoculated with e. amylovora, and from control leaves treated with buffer for both apple cultivars. a total of  <dig> different primer combinations of mse i primers having  <dig> selective nucleotides at their 3'-ends were applied. this resulted in the capture of approximately one thousand cdna fragments, ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. each cdna fragment generated an average of  <dig> discrete and clearly visible bands when amplified with a given aflp primer combination. overall, cdnas isolated from the "m.26" and "cv. g.41"apple cultivars displayed almost identical patterns on the polyacrylamide gel with a given primer combination in at least two independent experiments. however, a comparison of cdna-aflp patterns revealed the following differences: i) of the approximately one thousand cdna fragments detected on cdna-aflp gels,  <dig> bands were differentially up- or down-regulated between the two cultivars, ii) fifty-five fragments were up regulated  <dig> hpi in the susceptible cultivar "cv. m.26", whereas only  <dig> were up-regulated in the resistant cultivar "cv. g.41" at the same time and iii) at  <dig> hpi more fragments were up- regulated in "cv. g.41"  compared to "cv. m.26"  and only one down-regulated fragment were observed in "cv. m.26" . most of all the down-regulated fragments were found in the susceptible cultivar "cv. m.26"and most were found  <dig> hpi . these bands were excised from the silver-stained gel, re-amplified, and cloned into a plasmid vector.

the differentially expressed cdna sequences were assigned to broad functional categories based on similarity comparison to the genbank non-redundant protein database using blastx. table  <dig> shows the classification of the differentially expressed genes identified from both "cv. m.26" and "cv. g.41". for the largest group of clones  no functional motifs or homologues were identified in the database. the next most abundant group  were clones with similarity to genes involved in photosynthesis, followed by two groups of genes  involved in general metabolism and having similarity to genes associated with plant stress responses. finally, a number of clones were identified with similarity to genes involved in signaling pathways , energy , protein metabolism  and transport . the distribution of genes in the various categories may be biased by the relative numbers of annotated genes in the database for each category. however, it is clear that over half of the genes identified in this study could be placed into a potential functional category based on similarity to previously characterized genes.

the positive blastx hit results for the differentially expressed genes are shown in additional file  <dig> for "cv. m.26"and "cv. g.41". sequences with no significant similarity to known genes are not included. a number of the cdna-aflp fragments identified with different primer sets were subsequently found to be identical sequences. ests found in both genotypes were not included in additional file  <dig>  such as ferredoxin, cytochrome b <dig> and ribulose  <dig> -bisphosphate. blastx matches with high e-values were obtained for  <dig> unique sequences that were differentially expressed between the two genotypes, making it difficult to determine which of these ests are specifically involved in the resistance or susceptibility to fire blight. to narrow this list we used a candidate gene approach, in which the contigs from fire blight challenged tissue were compared against the ests from unchallenged tissue and the resulting blastn scores were ranked from lowest to highest. the expectation is that some of the sequences which do not match contigs from healthy tissue are expressed preferentially under disease conditions . sequences from fire blight-challenged tissue with the top  <dig> lowest match scores to sequences from healthy tissue were identified as potential candidates . as described by norelli et al.  <dig>  several other datasets were compared using blastn to annotate the contigs from infected tissue: i) genes associated with avirulent pseudomonas syringae infection of arabidopsis , ii) genes associated with virulent p. syringae infection of arabidopsis , iii) genes associated with the salicylic acid response in arabidopsis , and iv) ests derived from the suppression subtractive hybridization  disease-time course experiments  discussed below. in addition, a single sequence was selected from each ncbi apple unigene set that contained ests isolated for e. amylovora infected tissue and had an ncbi annotation associated with a known disease resistance pathway. each of these sequences was also compared against the contigs from infected tissue using blastn  . a threshold superior to  <dig> of the blastn score  was used to consider that an est was expressed in response to one of the condition previously described .

ests expressed preferentially under fire blight challenge , a. thaliana compatibility ests ; a. thaliana incompatibility ests , similar to a. thaliana salicylic acid response ests , and malus est in tissue challenged by e. amylovora found by norelli et al,  by suppression subtractive hybridization  . gene annotations were determined by most informative blastx comparision below a predetermined threshold of 1e- <dig>  na indicates blastn similarity score below  or above .

twenty eight genes candidate resistance/susceptibility genes were selected and their expression profiles by qrt-pcr . quantitative rt-pcr analysis of the same cdnas used for aflp analysis  confirmed the profile of expression observed by aflp for 79% of the  <dig> ests analyzed . additionally, cdnas isolated from the same biological experiment at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi were included for a time course analysis . looking at the putative function of the  <dig> genes tested by qpcr and their pattern of expression, we suggested in the figure  <dig> a possible representation of involvement of these genes dureint the interaction malus e. amylovora. it is possible to identified  <dig> classes of genes expressions, i) genes repress or activated only in the susceptible cultivars, m. <dig> , ii) genes only activated in the resistant cultivars g. <dig>  and genes activated in g. <dig> and repress in m. <dig> . it's interesting to observed form the pattern of expression of these genes that most the genes induced in the resistant cultivars g. <dig> are expressed  <dig> h post inoculation . few are induced early such as wrky-a1244/ <dig> , putative leucine-rich transmenbrane lytb like protein similar to the host factor of tobacco  and the protein kinase . in opposite most of the genes repress in the susceptible cultivars seems to be down regulated after or before  <dig> h post inoculation .

discussion
understanding the complex transcriptional changes occurring in malus in response to e. amylovora is important for efficient management of this pathogen. in this study, we used cdna-aflp to identify genes up- or down-regulated in resistant and susceptible apple cultivars after inoculation with e. amylovora. cdna-aflps have advantages over other commonly used gene display methods . this technique can be performed in the absence of dna sequence data and, as a pcr based method, only requires minute amounts of rna. it also allows direct comparison between distinct genotypes, which is often difficult by subtractive cdna techniques. because of the use of stringent annealing conditions during pcr, cdna-aflp banding patterns are highly reproducible compared with, for example, differential display pcr  <cit> . this technique has been used with success in apple to study the rootstock effect on gene expression patterns in apple tree scions  <cit> , the interaction between rosy apple aphids and malus  <cit> , and to find an apple gene that contributes to lowering the acidity of fruit  <cit> .

using a total of  <dig> different primer combinations,  <dig> different cdna-aflp fragments were identified between the resistant  and susceptible  apple cultivars after inoculation with e. amylovora. among the genes selected for verification by qrt-pcr, the pattern of expression was nearly identical in mock inoculated 'g.41' and 'm.26', suggesting that differentially expressed cdna-aflp fragments were not due to genetic differences between the two cultivars. if the  <dig>  genes regulated in response to bacterial pathogen inoculation in the a. thaliana-pst dc <dig> host pathogen system  <cit> are used as an estimate for the number of genes expected to respond in the malus-e. amylovora interaction, this study identified approximately 7% of the genes regulated in response to pathogen challenge. the relatively low level of transcriptome coverage in this study was probably due to the limited number of time points analyzed , as well as the specific time points selected for analysis. in a. thaliana the greatest gene expression in response to pst dc <dig> occurs  <dig> hpi and involves approximately  <dig> genes over all time points  <cit> . additionally, the labor- intensive nature of cdna-aflp analysis and the finite number of primer pairs that can feasibly be used limits the number of ests that can be detected. with the development of an apple genome sequence  <cit> , short-read, high-throughput sequencing technologies such as  should allow greater coverage of the apple transcriptome following e. amylovora infection in future studies.

cdna-aflp analysis results in est sequences that do not represent the entire gene transcript. using the malus unigene most similar to the shorter est for blastx comparisons was useful in improving the reliability of blast analysis and expanding the amount of biological information derived from the cdna-aflp ests. in general, using the malus unigene most similar to the est for blastx comparisons was most informative when the est contained primarily 3'-untranslated region sequence. when cdna sequence was available, blastn comparisons to the ncbi nr database usually produced equivalent results to blastx comparisons using the malus unigene most similar to the est. however, for species which lack extensive cdna and genomic sequence data, such as apple, the utility of blastn comparisons is limited. despite the utility of using the malus unigene most similar to the est for blastx comparisons, caution is needed in interpreting these blast results  <cit> .

this study has provided a preview of the genes associated with the interaction between malus and e. amylovora. the cdna-aflp sequences identified were assigned to broad functional categories based on database similarity . the percentage of each category is similar to what has been reported for the interaction between malus and pseudomonas fluorescens bk <dig>  <cit> , and is also consistent with previous studies on the interaction between malus and e. amylovora  <cit> . in agreement with the work of venisse et al  <cit> , we observed that genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathways were up-regulated in the resistant cultivars in response to e. amylovora. also, some of the defense-related and signaling genes, such as protein kinase, soluble nsf attachment protein, putative leucine rich repeat transmembrane protein kinase, and the putative disease resistance protein, aquaporin, were also found to be up- or down- regulated in a similar study comparing the response of the resistant apple cultivar 'evereste' to the susceptible rootstock 'mm.106'  <cit> . however, in contrast to the work of venisse et al  <cit>  and bonasera et al  <cit> , no pr genes were found up-regulated in the susceptible or resistant cultivars. this can be attributed to the fact that we did not use all the possible aflp primer combinations or that the genes were similarly regulated at the time points analyzed in this study.

fifteen percent of the cdna-aflp sequences identified in this study were involved in photosynthesis. the induction of some photosynthetic genes during the interaction between resistant malus and e. amylovora may implicate light-sensing mechanisms in the induction of plant disease defense signaling. current models of mechanisms of plant defense against pathogen infection are based on animal models, and rarely consider light signaling pathways or photo-produced h2o <dig> and other reactive oxygen species   <cit> . plant defense against pathogen infection has been shown to be linked to the light-sensing network and to the oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem ii   <cit> , and psii plays an important role in preventing the accumulation of ros  <cit> . frequently ros are needed to trigger protective responses, such as the down-regulation of psii activity  <cit>  and to induce systemic acquired resistance. during an incompatible interaction, the burst of ros can trigger an array of defense responses including a hypersensitive reaction. in the case of the compatible interaction between e. amylovora and a host plant , bursts of ros seem to be paradoxically necessary for a successful colonization of the plant by this bacterium  <cit> . this burst is the result of the combined action of two hrp effectors of e. amylovora hrpnea and dspa/e  <cit> . an increase in photosynthetic activity stimulates the production of atp and sugar. this suggests that malus × domestica may prevent the colonization by e. amylovora by increasing host plant defense via the light sensing signaling pathway and by activation of additional defense related genes. in the case of interaction with fire blight, the transcriptional up-regulation of photosynthesisrelated genes is similar to that observed during the interaction between arabidopsis thaliana and pseudomonas syringae  <cit> .

to identify potential candidate genes involved in host resistance mechanisms against e. amylovora we conducted a bioinformatics analysis to compare the cdna-aflp ests with all the non-fire blight associated ests at ncbi, with the ests found previously during the malus -e.amylovora interaction, with ssh ests activated in a. thaliana during a compatible interaction, with ssh ests activated in at during an incompatible interaction, with ssh ests activated in a. thaliana during sar, and with ests previously identified during the interaction between malus and e. amylovora . this approach allowed us to determine that  <dig> of the cdna-aflp ests were specifically involved in the interaction between malus and e. amylovora, either in basal defense response or in compatible or incompatible interaction. most of these ests were not identified in a similar ssh analysis  <cit> . this indicates that these two techniques are complementary, but could also be due to the partial transcriptome coverage reported in both this cdna-aflp and the ssh study  <cit> .

of the  <dig> cdna-aflp sequences identified by bioinformatics,  <dig> were selected for confirmation by qrt-pcr. the different genes were assigned in different mechanism according what was reported in the literature. this analysis confirmed the expression profile predicted by aflp for the ests analyzed and identified three classes of expression profiles. the first, and perhaps most interesting class of ests was only activated in the resistant cultivar, such as  <dig> -g41-48i  and  <dig> -g41-48i  <dig> protein family protein ) . these genes are good resistant gene candidates for fire blight. the second class contained ests activated at different times in the resistant cultivar than in the susceptible cultivar and repressed in the susceptible cultivar between  <dig> and  <dig> hpi depending on the ests, such as  <dig> -g41-48i  and  <dig> -g41i-48i  . these genes could be involved in the response of the plant that contributes to the rate of symptom development and possible resistance. the third class contained ests that were only repressed in the susceptible rootstock m. <dig>  such as  <dig> -m.26r-  . the pattern of expression of  <dig> of these genes  confirms the results of venisse et al. . these genes could possibly be useful as susceptibility markers. the profile of expression of other ests will be verified in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
the overall goal of this project was to characterize the genomic response of apple to fire blight. these data are being used to develop hypotheses of resistance or susceptibility mechanisms in malus to e. amylovora and provide an initial categorization of genes possibly involved in recognition events, early signaling responses the subsequent development of resistance or susceptibility . further analysis of these genes will help us understand the complex mechanisms of resistance or susceptibility that apple activates during infection by e. amylovora. the data also provide potential candidates for improving apple resistance to fire blight either by marker-assisted selection or genetic engineering. future studies will determine if these genes co-localize with resistance loci or qtls and how strategies might be developed to incorporate these genes into breeding programs.
