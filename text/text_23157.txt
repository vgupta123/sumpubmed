BACKGROUND
the fungal order hypocreales includes a wide range of ecologically diverse species including plant-pathogens, plant-endophytes, mycoparasites, and pathogens of insects and nematodes  <cit> . several hypocrealean species possesses effective pathogenic mechanisms and have been commercialized as bio-pesticides for plant-pathogens  <cit> . hypocrealean fungi are reported to display substantial flexibility of lifestyles  <cit> . large phylogenetic studies suggest that multiple transitions between different lifestyles have remained events of considerable importance in the evolutionary history of these fungi  <cit> . these fungi adapt to the changed environmental conditions when switching hosts and habitats putatively by acquiring proteolytic genes, such as subtilases  <cit> . subtilases are characterized by the presence of catalytic triad  and utilize a catalytic ser residue for activity  <cit> . evolutionarily, subtilases are conserved in all three domains of life, archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes  <cit> . subtilases in hypocrealean fungi play integral roles in host pathogenesis such as degradation of insect cuticle or protein-containing component of the egg shell  <cit> . although, subtilases are largely conserved in different life forms, they exhibit genetic and functional dissimilarities between different fungal genomes  <cit> .

recent whole genome sequencing efforts have identified subtilase genes present in various hypocrealean species . further, gene expression studies have emphasized on putative involvement of these subtilases in pathogenicity. subtilisin-like serine proteases produced by purpureocillium lilacinum are reported to degrade protein components of nematode and insect eggs. these proteins also play important role in the evolution of pathogenicity of nematode-trapping fungi against nematodes  <cit> . in a previous study, we reported that  <dig> serine protease genes in the p. lilacinum genome had homologs present in the pathogen – host interaction  database, which supported their role in pathogenicity  <cit> . in nematophagous fungus pochonia chlamydosporia, 59 % of serine proteases showed expression during their endophytic interaction with host  <cit> . enzymes involved in an organism’s response to pathogens and environmental stresses are among the functional categories most prone to expansion  <cit> . subtilisins are found expanded in metarhizium with lineage-specific duplications and had significant matches in the phi-database  <cit> . similarly, subtilisin proteins mediated the infection processes by degrading host cuticles in metarhizium anisopliae  <cit> . subtilisins involved in degrading insect cuticles are found expanded in beauveria bassiana and cordyceps militaris  <cit> .

despite previous efforts invested in identifying the important functional variations between different subtilases expressed by hypocreales, underlying molecular mechanisms involved in life style adaptation and pathogenesis remain elusive. this requires exhaustive exploration to identify protein residues under natural selection pressure in these genes. to date, only a few limited studies on the evolutionary pattern of subtilases in entomopathogenic fungi  have been carried out. no detailed bioinformatics analyses have been performed to correlate the evolutionary dynamic differences between subtilases coded by different families under hypocreales and functional shift.

in this study we conducted advanced bioinformatics analyses to elucidate the critical selective constraints leading to functional differentiation between subtilases of different families belonging to hypocreales. in accordance with current classification, subtilases were divided into two families: protease s <dig> family of the subtilase-like protease and s <dig> family of serine-carboxyl peptidases. the family s <dig> was further grouped into two subfamilies, subtilisin  and proteinase k . to identify functional divergence between paralogous proteins present in separate phylogenetic clusters, we evaluated selective constraints  after gene duplication, and mapped amino acid sites involved in functional divergence on secondary and tertiary structures of selected subtilases. the effects of amino acid sites involved in functional divergence on functional shift and structural stability of the proteins were discussed.

findings of the present study could provide important insights into the evolution of pathogenic mechanisms in different families of hypocreales. observations made in the study could be further translated for engineering subtilases with customized biotechnological properties for application in biological control and waste treatment.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis
the order hypocreales consist of seven families: nectriaceae, cordycipitaceae, clavicipitaceae, ophiocordycipitaceae, hypocreaceae, bionectriaceae and niessliaceae. whole genome sequencing  and genome annotation have been done for multiple species belonging to the five families i.e., nectriaceae, cordycipitaceae, clavicipitaceae, ophiocordycipitaceae and hypocreaceae  <cit> . however, very limited information is present in the ncbi database for the remaining two families with only one species sequenced for each, bionectriaceae: clonostachys rosea and niessliaceae: niessliaceae valetoniellopsis laxa. therefore, we carried out phylogenetic analyses by using the whole genome sequence and annotation files  of  <dig> representative fungal species belonging only to the five families, nectriaceae, cordycipitaceae, clavicipitaceae, ophiocordycipitaceae and hypocreaceae. clavicipitaceae, cordycipitaceae, and ophiocordycipitaceae families are particularly rich in entomopathogenic species. families nectriaceae and hypocreaceae contain plant pathogenic and mycoparasitic species respectively. the subtilase proteins coded by different species of hypocreales were identified by using merops   <cit> .

in nectriaceae family,  <dig> and  <dig> subtilase proteins coded by fusarium graminearum and fusarium oxysporum genomes respectively were identified. in cordycipitaceae family,  <dig> and  <dig> subtilase proteins belonging to beauveria bassiana and cordyceps militaris genomes respectively were recorded. in clavicipitaceae family,  <dig> subtilases of metarhizium acridum,  <dig> of metarhizium robertsii and  <dig> of pochonia chlamydosporia were identified. in ophiocordycipitaceae family,  <dig> and  <dig> subtilase proteins among tolypocladium inflatum and purpureocillium lilacinum genomes were found. the genome of trichoderma reesei belonging to hypocreaceae family coded for  <dig> subtilases.

based on homology and motif search, these proteins were grouped under three subfamilies, subtilisins , proteinase k  and serine-carboxyl peptidases . additional file 1: table s <dig> provides the accession details of these protein sequences. sequences were subjected to multiple sequence alignments and a maximum likelihood  phylogenetic tree was constructed in mega  <dig>  . stabilized phylogenetic trees for subtilisin , proteinase k  and serine-carboxyl peptidase  proteins are presented in figs.  <dig> and  <dig> and additional file 2: figure s <dig> respectively.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationships among protein sequences belonging to the subtilisin  family. the numbers indicate the bootstrap values for each branch

phylogenetic analysis of the subtilisin  gene family
the consensus phylogeny obtained for subtilisin  family protein sequences is shown in fig.  <dig>  the protein sequences from  <dig> species were clustered into six orthologous clades. three clades namely, “ophiocordycipitaceae”, “nectriaceae” and “cordycipitaceae/clavicipitaceae”, consisted of protein sequences from corresponding families of hypocreales. these three clades categorically reflected familial origin of the proteins. however, the remaining three clades possessed protein members from multiple families of hypocreales and thus seemed to be conserved across families. the first family based clade “ophiocordycipitaceae” consisted exclusively of  <dig> subtilisin  sequences of p. lilacinum which is a nematophagous fungus belonging to the family ophiocordycipitaceae. the second clade “nectriaceae” consisted of  <dig> members of f. graminearum and f. oxysporum that are known plant pathogens. the third clade consisted of  <dig> members of subtilisin  sequences of insect pathogens  belonging to the families cordycipitaceae and clavicipitaceae.

such a distribution of protein sequences in the phylogenetic tree provided insights into the evolutionary history of subtilisin  protein family in hypocreales. the composition of the three family oriented clades in the phylogenetic tree suggested that subtilases in hypocreales evolved to support lifestyle shifts from plant-pathogenesis  to insect-pathogenesis  on one hand and to nematophagy  on the other hand. another noteworthy observation was a distinct composition of “ophiocordycipitaceae” clade that was composed of protein sequences exclusively of p. lilacinum, which is a nematode trapping fungus. one of the previous studies on nematode trapping fungi concluded that positive selection acted on the subtilisin-like serine protease genes in nematode-trapping fungi, at least in the early stage of their evolution, which probably helped them diverge and acquire life-style specific functions. furthermore, separate clustering of the nematode trapping fungi is in agreement with previous reports . the composition of the “ophiocordycipitaceae” clade in the phylogenetic tree constructed in this study argued that in order to attain functional features for trapping nematode, subtilisin  protein sequences in p. lilacinum could have acquired positively selected residues and originated independently of sequences in plant pathogenic and entomopathogenic families of hypocreales. protein sequences of t. inflatum, another member of ophiocordycipitaceae family, were not clustered in the “ophiocordycipitaceae” clade and were found distributed across the phylogenetic tree. t. inflatum is primarily a pathogen of beetle larvae  <cit> , which also exists as a soil-saprotrophyte during the asexual phase of its lifecycle. such a phylogenetic distribution of protein sequences of t. inflatum could indicate a robust capability of its proteome to adapt to multiple and variable life strategies  <cit>  according to the changed environment. the subtilisin  proteins in these two species of ophiocordycipitaceae could have diverged quite a long time back and acquired functional differences.

phylogenetic analysis of the proteinase k  gene family
the proteinase k family was first identified in the fungi tritirachium album and named for its similarity to the widely known t. album proteinase k  <cit> . these proteases are generally characterized by the presence of a subtilisin n-terminal domain containing a propeptide  and a catalytic peptidase s <dig> domain.

the paralogous clades in phylogenetic tree seemed to differ from each other mainly by the presence of members belonging to specific families. similar to subtilisin  protein family, the phylogenetic tree clusters the selected  <dig> proteinase k  protein sequences into three family based orthologous clades: “ophiocordycipitaceae”, “nectriaceae” and “cordycipitaceae/clavicipitaceae” . also similar to subtilisin  ,  <dig> sequences of proteinase k  of p. lilacinum constructed a separate clade “ophiocordycipitaceae”. this was in agreement with previous studies , where in subtilases of p. lilacinum genome clustered distinctly from another member of the same family  and the other nematophagous fungus  included in our study. a total of  <dig> proteinase k  sequences,  <dig> from f. graminearum and  <dig> from f. oxysporum composed the “nectriaceae” clade. the “cordycipitaceae/clavicipitaceae” clade consisted of a total of  <dig> proteins sequences from four representative species  of cordycipitaceae and clavicipitaceae families included in the study.

placement of clades with respect to each other seemed intriguing. in the phylogenetic tree “nectriaceae” clade of plant pathogens was arranged between the “ophiocordycipitaceae” and “cordycipitaceae/clavicipitaceae” clades of nematophagous fungus and insect pathogens respectively. this kind of arrangement of the paralogous clades of proteinase k  sequences  putatively indicated towards divergent evolution of proteinase k  sequences to provide fitness to the fungal species according to the changes in host and habitat.

phylogenetic analysis of the serine-carboxyl peptidases  family
serine-carboxyl peptidases  family is also called as sedolisins. the protein folds of s <dig>  peptidases resembles that of subtilisin , however they are considerably larger, with the mature catalytic domains containing approximately  <dig> amino acids. these proteins possess unique catalytic triad, ser-glu-asp as well as the presence of an aspartic acid residue in the oxyanion hole.

in the present study, no distinct family based clades were observed in the phylogenetic analysis of the serine-carboxyl peptidases  sequences coded by the  <dig> fungal species . such phylogenetic arrangement of protein sequences may imply insignificant contribution of serine-carboxyl peptidases  towards functional diversification of species in the hypocreales order. sequences belonging to the serine-carboxyl peptidase  family were not analyzed further in this study.

estimating gene gain and loss via gene tree/species tree reconciliation
an important consideration in phylogenetic analysis is to address origin of new genes and function among species. evolutionary history exerts a strong influence on gene function  <cit>  and therefore, accurate inference of gene history is essential. furthermore, duplication and loss events lead to discordance between the topologies of gene tree and species tree  <cit> . to address differences between topologies of species tree and gene trees we inferred the history of gene gain and loss among genomes using a parsimony method   <cit>  which reconciled the gene tree with the species tree. for this analysis, we used the same species tree that was constructed for the comparative genome analysis of  <dig> hypocreales genomes in our previous study  <cit> .

gene gain and losses in subtilisin  gene family
to estimate gene gains and losses in subtilisin  gene family we reconciled the subtilisin  gene tree with the species tree. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> events of gene gains and losses respectively were identified. mapping of gene gains and losses on the three paralogous clades constructed in the phylogenetic tree  revealed  <dig> genes gains and  <dig> gene losses in “cordycipitaceae/clavicipitaceae”,  <dig> gene gains in “nectriaceae”,  <dig> gene gains and  <dig> gene losses in “ophiocordycipitaceae” clades. furthermore, gene tree was mapped on the species tree and species wise gene gains and losses were predicted . notung also predicted a few lost genes in unrecognizable species  that depicted gene gains and losses in an ancestral species. the ‘rearrange mode’ in notung, which minimizes the weighted sum of gene gains and losses based upon the threshold value , predicted a total of  <dig> and  <dig> gene duplication and loss events in the subtilisin  gene tree .fig.  <dig> reconciliation of subtilisin  gene tree with species tree by notung. a gene tree showing duplications  and losses ,  distribution of subtilisin  gene gains/losses among  <dig> hypocreales species




gene gains and losses in proteinase k  gene family
in order to find out gene gains and gene losses in proteinase k  gene family, the gene tree was reconciled with the species tree  <cit> . a total of  <dig> and  <dig> gene gains loss events respectively were identified. among the three paralogous clades of proteinase k ,  <dig> gene losses and  <dig> gene gains in “cordycipitaceae/clavicipitaceae”,  <dig> gene gains in “nectriaceae”,  <dig> gene gains and  <dig> gene losses in “ophiocordycipitaceae” clades respectively were identified .fig.  <dig> reconciliation of proteinase k  gene tree with species tree by notung. a gene tree showing duplications  and losses ,  distribution of proteinase k  gene gains/losses among  <dig> hypocreales species




proteinase k  gene tree was mapped on the species tree and species wise gene gains and losses were predicted . gene losses that occurred in evolutionary history of the species under analysis and also in unrecognizable but ancestral species  were also estimated. in ‘rearrange mode’ a total of  <dig> and  <dig> gene gains and gene losses were predicted in proteinase k gene  tree .

the phylogenetic tree analyses along with gene gain and loss estimation by notung suggested that gene gain and loss events during the course of evolution perhaps resulted in discordance in tree topologies of the gene trees and species tree in the study.

analysis of conserved motifs
to identify differences between the functional and conserved motifs of subtilases proteins among the family members of hypocreales in depth exploration was carried out by using multiple em for motif elicitation  tool   <cit> .

conserved motifs and functionally important residues in subtilisin  family
sequences of all  <dig> subtilisin  proteins that were included in the phylogenetic analysis were subject to meme suite. five distinct motifs were identified to be conserved among all the sequences . independent inspection of these  <dig> motifs in  <dig> sequences seemed to possess variability. however, at the clade level these  <dig> motifs were generally conserved in all three paralogous clades of the phylogenetic tree .fig.  <dig> multiple em for motif elicitation  analysis for identification of functional motifs among subtilisin s <dig>  protein sequences in hypocreales




the first two motifs m <dig>  and m <dig>  were localized in n-terminus of the proteins. the mid region of motif m <dig> was highly variable among all clades. however, mid region of m <dig> was conserved within the specific clades. motif m <dig> was absent in one  out of the total  <dig> sequences used in the analysis. in all these clades all “x” positions in motif m <dig> were occupied by a non-polar residue.

the third motif m <dig>  was also present towards the n-terminus of the subtilisin  protein family. the first “x” position was occupied by a negatively charged residue e  in “ophiocordycipitaceae” clade, a nonpolar residue p  in the “cordycipitaceae/clavicipitaceae” clade and by a positively charged residue k  in “nectriaceae” clade. the second “x” position of this motif was occupied by a non-polar residue g  in “ophiocordycipitaceae” and “nectriaceae” clades where as in “cordycipitaceae/clavicipitaceae” clade it was represented by a negatively charged amino acid residue d .

the fourth motif m <dig>  was found to be highly conserved in the mid region of subtilisin  proteins. alanine, a non-polar residue of this motif was replaced by polar residue t/s  in “ophiocordycipitaceae” clade. the first “x” position contained a polar residue t  in almost all members of the  <dig> clades and the second “x” position of this motif was represented by a positively charged residue in the “ophiocordycipitaceae” and “nectriaceae” clades whereas in the “cordycipitaceae/clavicipitaceae” clade it was occupied by a non-polar residue a/i .

the fifth motif m <dig> , starts with the conserved residues glycine, threonine and serine and is present in mid region of the protein. although the variable region showed many changes among  <dig> sequences, it was conserved within the respective paralogous clade.

conserved motifs and functionally important residues in proteinase k  family
protein sequences of  <dig> proteinase k  members were subjected to meme suite for motif identification. five distinct motifs were found conserved among all the sequences . out of these  <dig> motifs,  <dig> motifs were the same as the motifs identified in the analysis of subtilisin  protein sequences, namely m <dig>  & m <dig>  at amino acid positions190- <dig> and 380– <dig> respectively.fig.  <dig> multiple em for motif elicitation  analysis for identification of functional motifs among proteinase k  protein sequences in hypocreales




motif m <dig>  was present in the mid region of proteinase k  proteins and was found quite conserved in the three paralogous clades . the variable “xxx” part of m <dig> seemed to differ in a clade specific manner. in the clade “ophiocordycipitaceae” the first two “xx” were occupied by vr  gr , sr , in which first residue shuffled from a non-polar to a polar residue and the second residue was mostly a positively charged residue r . the third “x” existed in two forms , both having a non-polar nature. in the “cordycipitaceae/clavicipitaceae” clade, the first two “xx” were represented by dq , ra , gr , ar , sr  and dr , in which the first residue varied from negatively charged to a non-polar/polar residue; the second residue which was an almost conserved r , was replaced by q  in only one member; the third “x” changed from non-polar residue v  to another non-polar residue i . in the nectriaceae clade, the first two “xx” were occupied by gt  or as  residues, in which the first was a non-polar and second was a polar amino acid residue. the third “x” position was represented by v/i/l  in a manner similar to the “ophiocordycipitaceae” and “cordycipitaceae/ clavicipitaceae” clades.

motif m <dig>  was also detected in the mid region of the protein sequences of proteinase k . this motif was highly conserved within the  <dig> clades; however, the variable amino acid positions  were conserved in a clade specific manner. the first “x” position varied from a non-polar to polar residue and the second “x” position was occupied by a negatively charged amino acid in both the “ophiocordycipitaceae” and “cordycipitaceae/clavicipitaceae” clades. in “nectriaceae” the first “x” position was shared by n/k/s  and second “x” was e, a negatively charged amino acid similar to the other two clades. the chemical nature of the third “x” of this motif varied from negatively charged to non-polar/ polar residue. it was occupied by e  in “ophiocordycipitaceae” clade, e/g  in “cordycipitaceae/clavicipitaceae” clade, and e/q/g  in “nectriaceae” clade.

motif m <dig> dxxapg was situated towards the c-terminal of proteinase k protein. this motif was highly conserved among all  <dig> sequences of proteinase k  family. in this motif the two “xx” positions were also quite conserved in their chemical nature and were occupied by a non-polar residue and a polar residue respectively among all three clades.

considerable conservation of motifs between the protein sequences and variability in residues in a clade specific manner observed in motif analyses proposed that the variation in the conserved residues could play a significant role in imparting clade specific differences in the enzymatic activity and stability of subtilisin  and proteinase k  protein families.

positive selection in protein sequence and biological significance
selection pressure helps evolve proteins to acquire function according to the environmental conditions. positive selection promotes the fixation of beneficial mutations in a population and leads to functional shift of a protein  <cit> . the ratio of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site  to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site  is termed as ω, which measures selective pressure on a sequence. if ω >  <dig> it signifies positive selection pressure, ω =  <dig> signifies neutral evolution, while ω <  <dig> indicates purifying selection pressure.

site models and branch-site models in codeml were used to detect positive selection along the pre-specified groups. these models test at the codon level if a hypothesis which allows for positive selection  is a better fit to the data than a null neutral hypothesis . site-models identified sites that are under recurrent positive selection across the phylogenetic tree. branch-site models detected sites that have been under positive selection at a particular point of evolution, i.e. on a specific branch of the evolutionary tree.

analysis of paralogous clades of subtilisin  proteins based on site and branch-site models
site models and branch-site models based analysis carried out for estimation of selective pressure on the subtilisin  gene family in hypocreales is presented in tables  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. after removal of gaps a total of  <dig> sites were tested for positive selection by using codeml program. the site models allow the ω ratio to vary among codons. the lrts were significant in m1a vs. m2a and m <dig> vs. m <dig> comparisons. our results suggested the following:  model m2a fits the data better and  positive selection prevailed over neutral selection when m1a and m2a models were compared. in m2a analysis, four sites were detected as positively selected sites with a p-value <  <dig>  .table  <dig> likelihood estimates of subtilisin  gene family for site models in paml

in order to identify occurrence of positive selection in specific stages of evolution or in specific branches, branch site models were employed. positively selected amino acid sites in three branches/clades  were searched. we found very high dn/ds ratio  , which indicated that gene sequences were positively selected in the “cordycipitaceae/clavicipitaceae” and “ophiocordycipitaceae” branches.

to detect specific stages of evolution and positive selection in proteinase k gene family, branch site models were employed to search for amino acid sites under positive selection in branches for  <dig> clade branch sites: “nectriaceae”, “cordycipitaceae/clavicipitaceae” and “ophiocordycipitaceae”. in the “ophiocordycipitaceae” clade, two positively selected sites  were detected with a p-value < <dig> . this observation is in accordance with our findings for the subtilisin  gene family. our results suggested that “ophiocordycipitaceae” clade consisting of protein sequences exclusively of p. lilacinum recorded maximum sites under positive selection in the evolutionary tree. subtilisin-like proteins are known to play crucial role in trapping and pathogenesis of nematode in nematophagous fungi . the observed positive selection on protein residues and functional shift in protein sequences could have enabled successful pathogen-host interaction in p. lilacinum.


analysis of type i and type ii functional divergence
protein residues could be subjected to altered functional constraints during evolution especially after gene duplication  <cit> . evaluation of functional constraints operating on amino acid residues of subtilisin  and proteinase k  gene families was carried out by diverge . diverge analysis tests for the presence of functional divergence of two types, type i and type ii. functional divergence type i stands for significant variability between the duplicate genes in paralogous clades at conserved sites. type i value indicates the selection pressure at particular protein residue site, due to the acquisition or pre-existence of a functional role for that site, in one of the clades compared to the paralogous clade. functional divergence type ii identifies the mutations that after gene duplication lead to fixation of different amino acids in the paralogous clades. these mutations remain conserved after speciation in each clade.

functional divergence in subtilisin  gene family
clades “ophiocordycipitaceae”, “nectriaceae” and “cordycipitaceae/clavicipitaceae” which consisted of proteins from specific families in the phylogenetic analysis, were examined for functional divergence in a pair-wise manner. the log-likelihood values for functional divergence type i analysis supported hypothesis of existence of functional divergence than the null hypothesis of no functional divergence: “nectriaceae” vs. “cordycipitaceae/clavicipitaceae” ; “nectriaceae” vs. “ophiocordycipitaceae” .  <dig> distinct type  <dig> divergence sites were observed which are conserved in “nectriaceae” clade but showed divergence  in the other two clades. type ii analysis was highly significant with a value of θii =  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and revealed  <dig> putative divergent sites at threshold posterior ratio  of  <dig> ; θii =  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and revealed  <dig> putative divergent sites at threshold posterior ratio  of  <dig> . the values of divergence coefficient for type i and type ii analyses  for all pairs are presented in . for all the above mentioned subsets, the values of θi and θii were greater than  <dig>  which suggested that strong functional divergence signals could be picked up between these clades. the significant divergence values implied occurrence of site-specific altered selective constraints/ radical shifts in amino acid physiochemical properties following gene duplication and/or speciation. detailed analysis of these sites would help in delineating the amino acids that are responsible for differences in biochemical features and structural stability in subtilisin  proteins in these clades .table  <dig> divergence analysis among subtilisin  genes in hypocreales. functional divergence estimates of type i and type ii of two clusters comparison are shown

variation in evolutionary rates among residues  within a given protein is partially attributable to positive diversifying selection leading to adaptation to environmental changes. site specific evolutionary rates are suggested to be governed by interplay between structural and functional constraints  <cit> . we observed that  <dig> out of  <dig>   <dig> out of  <dig> and  <dig> out of  <dig> rvs sites in “nectriaceae”, “cordycipitaceae/clavicipitaceae” and “ophiocordycipitaceae” clades respectively also experienced type ii divergence . the overlap between the rvs and type ii sites highlighted the determining contribution of these residues in protein function and evolution.

functional divergence in proteinase k  gene family
no functional divergence between the paralogous clades among protein sequences of the proteinase k  family was observed  and therefore, the sequences were not included for further analyses in the study.

to analyse the possible role of amino acids identified under diverge analyses on the function and structure of subtilisin  proteins, the type ii and rvs  sites were mapped on the secondary structure of the proteins . a total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> type ii divergence sites and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> rvs sites in “nectriaceae”, “cordycipitaceae/clavicipitaceae” and “ophiocordycipitaceae” clades respectively are part of alpha helices  that constitute the backbone peptide bonds of the protein. presence of particular rvs and type ii divergence sites on secondary structure of the proteins argued for their putative involvement in protein structure stability/alteration and evolution. i <dig> and g <dig> residues that experienced type ii divergence were part of the predicted active and binding sites of the protein in “nectriaceae” clade; l <dig> residue that experienced type ii divergence and rvs was located at the predicted active site of the protein in “cordycipitaceae/clavicipitaceae” clade; v <dig> residue experienced type ii divergence and was part of the predicted active site of the protein in “ophiocordycipitaceae” clade . these findings indicated that there is substantial contribution of divergent sites in defining the catalytic triad, active site and substrate binding cavity of the subtilisin  proteins of the three paralogous clades and putatively helped in functional shift of these proteins among species of hypocreales.fig.  <dig> functional divergence in subtilisin  protein sequences. a subtilisin structure of a member  of the “nectriaceae” clade is shown. the amino acid residues that experienced site-specific rate shift  and/or type ii divergence and fell into the catalytic triad/active sites/substrate binding sites of the enzyme are highlighted. the catalytic triad is shown by a triangle . predicted active sites are shown in yellow colour; substrate binding sites are shown in blue colour. amino acids highlighted in brown colour experienced type-ii divergence and was present in an active site and a binding site. b subtilisin structure of a member  of the “cordycipitaceae/clavicipitaceae” clade is shown. the amino acids residues that experienced site-specific rate shift  and/or type ii divergence and fell into the catalytic triad/active sites/substrate binding sites of the enzyme are highlighted. predicted catalytic triad is shown by a triangle ; active sites in cyan colour, substrate binding sites in magenta colour. amino acid highlighted in red experienced both rvs and type-ii divergence and was present in one of the active sites. c subtilisin structure of a member  of the “ophiocordycipitaceae” clade is shown. the amino acids residues that experienced site-specific rate shift  and/or type ii divergence and fell into the catalytic triad/active sites/substrate binding sites of the enzyme are highlighted. predicted catalytic triad is shown by a triangle ; active sites in yellow colour, substrate binding sites in magenta colour. amino acid highlighted in black experienced type-ii divergence and was present in one of the active sites




CONCLUSIONS
subtilases seemed to be major determinants of adaptation in hypocrealean fungi according to the changing environment, lifestyle and host. phylogenetic analysis and identification of amino acid residues under positive selection and type ii divergence provided insights into specific adaptation mechanisms. rvs and type ii sites identified on the secondary structure, catalytic triads, active sites and substrate binding sites of the subtilisin  proteins of the three paralogous clades could be responsible for functional shift of these proteins during the course of evolution.
