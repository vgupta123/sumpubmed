BACKGROUND
approximately  <dig>  americans suffer from venous leg ulcers , which are extremely costly to manage and produce significant suffering  <cit> . hippocrates believed that vlu were the bodies way to vent "evil humors" and advocated such ulcers should not be treated. his philosophy was that such ulcers should be allowed to express these evil humors naturally  <cit> . in spite of hippocrates' beliefs, the modern clinical goal is to treat and cure vlu. venous insufficiency is becoming epidemic with almost half of all females and one quarter of all males estimated to suffer from this disease  <cit> . it is generally agreed that chronic venous disease  is caused by persistent venous hypertension in the lower extremities stemming from a decay in the efficiency and performance of one-way valves in perforating, superficial or deep veins. venous hypertension in the extremities, results in clinical changes leading from edema and pain  through lipodermatosclerosis, hyperpigmentation, hyperkeratosis and ultimately to a proclivity for the development of chronic vlu  <cit> .

as the underlying pathology associated with cvd develops, ulcers typically start when the skin, in the area of fluid accumulation, becomes physically injured . because circulation is compromised due to associated pathologies, the effectiveness of the area to heal is reduced along with the overall functioning of the local immune system. the underlying pathological process, from the host perspective, still represents an area of developing hypotheses and has been reviewed recently in the literature  <cit> . a fully comprehensive, all encompassing understanding of the developmental mechanism related to why vlu remain chronic remains elusive and from a clinical perspective, brem et al. stated "the exact mechanism underlying the formation of venous ulceration is unknown"  <cit> .

vlu formation and their chronic nature is associated with a complex and multifactorial process. a primary factor contributing to the chronic nature of vlu is now known to be polymicrobial biofilm infection. the fact that many venous leg ulcers persist even after venous hypertension is adequately corrected clinically, is key evidence that this biofilm phenotype infection of the wound bed contributes significantly to the persistence associated with vlu. it is logical that this impaired host environment is extremely susceptible to opportunistic bacteria, which can then establish chronic infections. it also is logical that the contribution of biofilm to the production and persistence of vlu was overlooked until recently because its molecular footprint is so similar to the inflammation produced by or attributed solely to venous hypertension  <cit> .

the current study was undertaken to better characterize the bacterial ecology of vlu using modern next-generation approaches  <cit> . understanding the bacterial ecology of vlu associated biofilm is a critical next step in further evaluating the contribution of the wound microbiome to establishing and promoting the chronicity of vlu  <cit> . using btefap, metagenomic, quantitative pcr and the new btefap titanium based methods the bacterial diversity of  <dig> separate vlu, the overall metagenomic diversity in a pool of  <dig> vlu, and the topological bacterial diversity of  <dig> separate vlu are evaluated. this study represents one of the most comprehensive evaluations of microbial diversity in chronic wounds to date. the overall goal is to determine if vlu have the bacterial diversity between individual samples that we have shown with diabetic foot ulcers  <cit>  and surgical site infections  <cit>  and to do a preliminary screening of the total microbial diversity in these chronic wounds based upon a next-generation metagenomic approach. this metagenomic approach was also expected to help us to determine if there are any notable differences seen between a de novo approach to bacterial composition when compared to the 16s ribosomal dna btefap approach  <cit> .

RESULTS
diversity among  <dig> vlu
using the btefap methodology the diversity of  <dig> different vlu were individually evaluated. a total of  <dig>  individual sequence reads longer than  <dig> bp were evaluated among the  <dig> samples with  <dig>  sequences generating blastn hits against the bacterial database. the average sequence identity was  <dig> %. a total of  <dig>  sequences had identity below 97% suggesting they represented uncharacterized bacteria. the majority of these unknown organisms were most closely related based upon 16s sequence to bacterioides, paludibacter, pseudomonas, finegoldia, and corynebacterium spp. these bacteria, which can be considered unknown or previously uncharacterized bacterial species, were identified based upon their closest identification and ranked at the genus, family or order level as appropriate. only  <dig> of the total number of analyzed sequences fell below 80% identity and were not considered in subsequent analyses.

a total of  <dig> different genera  were identified among the  <dig> wounds indicating a large relative diversity. the top  <dig> unique and most ubiquitous species  are indicated in table  <dig>  the most ubiquitous genera were, in order and unknown bacteroides, staphylococcus aureus, and corynebacterium spp the bacteroides was only of marginal identity to any known bacteroides species, thus represents a previously uncharacterized type of wound bacteria. several genera were found in high percentage in individual wounds . staphylococcus spp.  predominated in  <dig> of the wounds, the unknown bacteroidetes  predominated in  <dig> of the wounds, serratia  was a predominant population in  <dig> of the wounds, streptococcus, finegoldia, corynebacterium and peptoniphilus spp. were the predominant genera in  <dig> wounds each, while proteus and pseudomonas spp. were the major population in one wound each. the remaining wounds were highly diverse with no overwhelmingly predominant populations. it is interesting that so many of these wounds were predominated by what are likely strict anaerobic bacteria with only very minor populations of facultative or strict aerobes. this suggests that such anaerobes might be contributing to the etiology of such biofilm infections. figure  <dig> indicates there are a number of important functional equivalent pathogroups  <cit>  associated with vlu. at a relative distance of  <dig> based upon the weighted-pair linkage and manhattan distance we note there are  <dig> total clusters, which included  <dig> predominant clusters representing possible pathogroups  <cit> . it is also evident that staphylococcus, serratia, and bacterioides are the defining variables for  <dig> of these  <dig> clusters. from this data we note that 53% of the populations were gram positive,  <dig> % are facultative anaerobes, 30% were strict anaerobes, and 58% were rod shaped bacteria. supplementary data  provides a secondary comprehensive evaluation of the bacterial diversity in each of the  <dig> wounds.

the primary identification based upon percent sequence identity as described in the materials and methods is indicated. for genera followed by spp. this indicates that resolution between multiple species of the same genera was not possible. the bacteroidales designation represents the closest possible relationship for these previously uncharacterized bacteria. there is a second bacteroidales , which also occurs in  <dig> of the wounds. because these identifications are based upon average  <dig> bp such designations should be considered tentative at the species level. the results were however validated using quantitative pcr. the number of samples each bacteria was detected in is provided along with the average percent  among the positive samples, the standard deviation  and the range of percentages among the positive samples is provided.

as a confirmatory step for the btefap diversity study we utilized a quantitative pcr wound diagnostic panel , described previously  <cit> . a total of  <dig> of the vlu samples were chosen because they contained a predicted predominance of bacteria targeted by the qpcr wound panel. the results of the qpcr were provided to us in the form of relative ratios of each detected bacterium in the sample and these results compared to the corresponding btefap bacterial ratio data. in short the percentages of the key bacteria detected using btefap analysis were correlated  with the relative percentages determined using qpcr. this provides an indication of the validity of the btefap data.

metagenomics
we evaluated, using a bulk pyrosequencing metagenomics approach, a uniformly compiled pool of  <dig> vlu dna extractions. a total of  <dig>  individual reads were generated averaging  <dig> bp. there were  <dig>  reads that could be assigned taxonomic designations. of those reads assigned to a taxonomic designation the majority  fell into the chordata, which represents human genetic information confirmed based upon subsequence blastn and blastx designations to homo sapiens genomic data contained within ncbi. the remaining reads were utilized to generate an evaluation of the microbial population within these  <dig> vlu samples. there were  <dig>  reads, which were assigned to bacteria, which was evaluated at the class level for the subsequent comparisons. table  <dig> provides a comparative breakdown at the bacterial class level of btefap analyses and the metagenomic analysis. there was good overall relationship  with what was predicted in the 10-sample vlu pool using metagenomic data and what was detected using the same  <dig> sample pool analyzed in our previous work using btefap  <cit> . interestingly, there was also a positive relationship at the same class taxonomic level between the 10-sample pool and the averages of the  <dig> vlu samples at the class level .

this table shows the difference in metagenomic and 16s pyrosequencing approach described previously  <cit> . also shown is the averages related to the  <dig> individual samples for comparison. the r-squared =  <dig>  for correlation between btefap and metagenomics at the class level in the  <dig> pooled samples.

further analysis of the metagenomic data in relation to other microorganisms provided additional interesting information. a relatively high number of genes  mapped to apicomplexa  were detected. fungi  made up  <dig> reads. a total of  <dig> reads were designated as archaea. another interesting finding within the metagenomic data was a high number of sequences  most closely related to cyanobacteria. this data could not be verified during subsequent analyses and was not noted in any of the btefap datasets and evidence suggested it may be human mitochondrial sequence information . however, the most surprising taxonomic relationship showed that  <dig> reads were most closely related to viruses, which was confirmed based upon homology to the "nr" and "nt" databases of ncbi. these included relationships to dsdna viruses, no rna stage primarily related to human herpes virus, human adenovirus, staphylococcus phage, gryllus bimaculatus virus, corynebacterium phage, bacteriophage b <dig>  and a high prevalence of glypta fumiferanae ichnovirus related sequences. there were also a set of reads most closely related to retro-transcribing virus including tumor viruses, leukemia viruses, and reticuloendotheliosis viruses. represented within these designations were gene identifications related to gag-pol polyproteins, proteases, polymerases, envelope proteins, viral membrane proteins, capsid-associated proteins, carbohydrate binding proteins, fiber proteins, and immediate early genes. because most of these reads were only distantly related to known virus, it is interesting to hypothesize about the presence of previously undiscovered virus associated with chronic wounds. it has been shown particularly in burn wounds that herpes virus i can cause infection and complications and even outbreaks within burn treatment units  <cit> . the presence of bacteriophage-related reads were to be expected considering the relatively high contribution of bacteria.

wound topology analysis
we also evaluated a set of  <dig> vlu using both btefap  and later a second set of  <dig> with the newest btefap titanium techniques. the goal of this analysis was to determine how homogeneous  the bacterial ecology of wounds were across their surface. our usual method, when we obtain samples for molecular diagnostics, indicates we debride larger areas that include center and edge regions and homogenize to obtain a global picture of the bacterial diversity. we continue to hold the assumption  that wounds are by definition very diverse in their microbial ecology among different samples, but within individual wounds the diversity is largely uniform. however, the question remained that  if we sample small discrete locations, rather than the typical larger areas we utilize clinically, would we see any variations in the populations? figures  <dig> panels a, b, c, and d show the general sampling scheme for each of these samples with the corresponding btefap data provided in tables  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . the images and data associated with these  <dig> patients, which were evaluated using the original btefap, provide a good indication of the topological diversity which may exist within individual wounds. subject  <dig> had uniform occurrence of pseudomonas  across the entire wound with individual sites within the wound containing anaerobes including porphyromonas, peptoniphilus, finegoldia and anaerococcus spp. subject  <dig> had relatively high divergence among each of the sampling sites. corynebacterium was the most uniform bacteria along with pseudomonas and proteus. several anaerobes were also very ubiquitous within the individual subsamples including anaerococcus, clostridium and peptoniphilus. an unknown enterobacteriacea was also observed in half of the subsamples. subject  <dig> was interesting in that anaerobic peptoniphilus was the most ubiquitous and predominant bacteria identified followed by corynebacterium, peptostreptococcus, pseudomonas, staphylococcus, and streptococcus. this sample indicates the high divergence possible among such discrete subsamples. subject  <dig> was the exception to the usual high bacterial diversity rule of chronic wounds and showed nearly  <dig> percent pseudomonas in each of the sub samples. this topological evaluation of bacterial diversity indicates how important appropriate sampling is to fully characterize the global wound ecology.

percentages of each genera are indicated along with their location  based upon the map indicated in figure 2a. the location designations  are also provided.

utilizing the new btefap titanium technology a second topology evaluation was also conducted on  <dig> of the vlu patients. the new btefap methods utilize the new titanium chemistry for pyrosequencing, which increases the read length of individual sequences from an average of  <dig> bp to over  <dig> bp, utilize a single pcr step, and incorporate error reading polymerases. this new approach provides much better resolution at the individual species level and dramatically enhances our ability to characterize wound bacterial ecology. four additional subjects were evaluated . the results were similar to what we observed using the original btefap method with the exception that we had more confidence in our ability to resolve certain populations at the species level. subject  <dig> showed a high prevalence of pseudomonas aeruginosa among the majority of the subsamples with notable populations of burkholdaria spp , an unknown bacteroidales, and clostridium spp . subject  <dig> showed definite ubiquitous detection of pseudomonas aeruginosa with notable populations of streptococcus parasanguinis across the wound. subject  <dig> showed a remarkable diversity and consistency across the entire wound with primary populations being staphylococcus aureus, peptoniphilus harei, staphylococcus capitis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, anaerococcus prevotii, and finegoldia magna. finally subject  <dig> also showed high consistency with major populations being streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium striatum, staphylococcus aureus, with minor contributions in individual sites from pseudomonas aeruginosa and corynebacterium simulans. it should be noted that most of the wounds we have evaluated in the past have relatively high overall numbers of bacteria  so even relatively low percentages of individual species such as 2% anaerococcus spp. may potentially represents a large number of individual bacteria propagating within wound biofilms.

CONCLUSIONS
dowd et al  <cit>  first used pyrosequencing to survey pooled samples of vlu, diabetic foot ulcers and decubitous ulcers and later did a more comprehensive survey of diabetic foot ulcers  <cit> . this study takes a similar but more comprehensive approach with vlu in order to better elucidate the individual ecologies in a large population of such chronic wounds. here we show that individual wounds have distinct ecological footprints. we also show that within individual wounds there can be both significant site specific differences and relative uniformity in the bacterial ecology. the bottom line appears to be that each wound must be carefully evaluated and that no single pathogen is likely to be the causative agent of such infections. the wound care scientific and clinical opinion leaders have come to accepted the abundance of data showing that these polymicrobial biofilms represent a primary impediment to wound healing  <cit> . based upon the current work and previous efforts we can deduce that the unique profiles of each individual wound indicate that a personalized approach to therapeutics combined with the multiple concurrent strategies of biofilm-based wound care  <cit>  will revolutionize wound care. as tom pollard indicated in a commentary recently, biofilm-based wound care is " a significant shift in our whole approach to wound healing."  <cit> . biofilm-based wound care combined with individualized therapeutic approaches and accurate rapid molecular diagnostics provides renewed found hope for those suffering with chronic wounds.
