BACKGROUND
phosphate is an essential component of numerous biomolecules. therefore, the control of intracellular phosphate concentrations is vital for bacterial survival. at least two major systems are involved in managing intracellular concentrations of inorganic orthophosphate , the preferred primary source of phosphate  <cit> . when pi is abundant, the low affinity pit transporter appears to be primarily responsible for pi uptake  <cit> . when pi becomes limited, the high affinity pst transport system  is activated, and takes over as the predominant pi uptake system  <cit> .

in escherichia coli and other enterobacteriaceae, the cellular response to pi availability is mediated via the phobr two-component system. under conditions of pi limitation, the sensor histidine kinase phor is autophosphorylated  <cit> . phor then activates its cognate response regulator, phob  <cit> , which in turn activates expression of multiple genes, termed the pho regulon, via direct binding to a conserved pho box sequence found overlapping - <dig> regions in target gene promoters  <cit> . in e. coli, the pho regulon is believed to consist of approximately  <dig> genes involved in the adaptation to survival under low pi conditions, including pstscab-phou and phobr  <cit> . phosphate regulation is controlled via similar mechanisms in bacillus subtilis and streptomyces species, although the consensus pho boxes are different in each system  <cit> . mutations in the pstscab-phou operon result in constitutive activation of phor and hence, constitutive phosphorylation of phob  <cit> . therefore, pst mutants are proposed to mimic low pi conditions.

pi has been found to negatively regulate the biosynthesis of antibiotics and other secondary metabolites in multiple bacterial species . however, the complex molecular mechanisms underlying the pi mediated regulation of secondary metabolism are not well characterised. in this study we investigate the role of the phobr two-component system, and pi availability, on the regulation of antibiotic production in the gram-negative enterobacteriaceae, serratia sp. atcc  <dig> . serratia  <dig> synthesises the red, tripyrrole antibiotic, prodigiosin   <cit> . the natural physiological role of pig in the producing organism may be as an antimicrobial agent  <cit> . in addition, pig is of clinical interest due to the observed anticancer and immunosuppressive properties of this compound  <cit> . serratia  <dig> also produces the β-lactam antibiotic, carbapenem   <cit> . both the pig and car biosynthetic gene clusters have been characterised   <cit> .

production of secondary metabolites in serratia  <dig> is controlled by a hierarchial network of regulators  <cit> . this includes a luxir-type quorum sensing  system   <cit> , which allows gene expression to be regulated in response to cell density via the production and detection of low molecular weight signal molecules  <cit> . in serratia  <dig>  the n-acyl homoserine lactone  synthase smai produces two signalling molecules, n-butanoyl-l-homoserine lactone  and n-hexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone , with bhl being the major product  <cit> . at low cell density, smar acts as a transcriptional repressor of target genes  <cit> . at high cell density, and hence high bhl/hhl levels, smar binds bhl/hhl, resulting in decreased dna-binding affinity with a consequent alleviation of repression. qs controls secondary metabolism in serratia  <dig> via at least four other regulatory genes   <cit> . the putative slya/marr-family transcriptional regulator, rap , is an activator of pig and car production in serratia  <dig>  <cit> . rap shares similarity with the global transcriptional regulator rova  from yersina spp.  <cit> . more than  <dig> additional genes have been shown to regulate secondary metabolism in serratia  <dig>  and these are predicted to be responding to additional environmental stimuli  <cit> .

previously, we demonstrated that, in serratia  <dig>  mutations within genes predicted to encode homologues of the e. coli pstscab-phou phosphate transport system resulted in over-production of both pig  and car , at the level of transcription of the biosynthetic genes  <cit> . in this study we investigate further the molecular mechanism by which these effects are occurring. we demonstrate that secondary metabolism in serratia  <dig> is upregulated in response to mutations in pstscab-phou or pi limitation, via the phobr two-component system. in addition, we provide evidence that expression of the smai, piga and rap genes are activated via phobr in serratia  <dig>  hence, we propose a model in which pi limitation increases secondary metabolism in serratia  <dig> via multiple, inter-linked pathways, incorporating the global transcriptional regulators phob, smar and rap.

RESULTS
sequence analysis of the pstscab-phou operon in serratia 39006
previously, serratia  <dig> mutants were identified which contained transposon insertions in regions sharing sequence similarity to the psts and psta genes from e. coli  <cit> . dna sequencing analysis of this region revealed that serratia  <dig> possesses a complete pstscab-phou operon, the organisation of which is consistent with other enteric bacteria in which a pst operon has been identified .

the serratia  <dig> psts gene was predicted to encode a protein most similar to psts from the enteric bacteria erwinia carotovora ssp. atroseptica scri <dig>  . the putative protein product encoded by pstc shared 90% identity and 95% similarity with pstc of eca  <dig>  the psta gene is predicted to encode a protein most similar to psta of eca  <dig> . the predicted protein encoded by pstb was most similar to pstb of eca  <dig> . finally, phou was predicted to encode a protein most similar to phou of eca  <dig> .

isolation and sequence analysis of phobr mutants of serratia 39006
mutations in the pstscab-phou operon are thought to mimic growth in limiting phosphate, and hence result in constitutive activation of the pho regulon  <cit> . we previously showed that pig, car and ahl production were increased in the psts mutant  <cit> . a possible explanation for this effect is that piga, cara and smai are regulated via the serratia  <dig> pho regulon.

random transposon insertions in the phobr operon were isolated based on their lack of hyperpigmentation when grown on pi-limiting media. growth on pi-limiting media results in increased pig production in the wild-type   <cit> . potential phobr mutants were then checked for their loss of alkaline phosphatase activity  and the sequence of the operon was determined, as described in methods. the phob gene was predicted to encode a  <dig> amino acid  protein with highest similarity to phob from eca  <dig> . the phor gene was located  <dig> bp downstream of phob, and was predicted to encode a  <dig> aa protein sharing the highest degree of similarity to eca  <dig> phor .

phob regulates expression of pstc in serratia 39006
in e. coli, the pst operon is activated via direct binding of phob to a conserved pho box upstream of psts  <cit> . as serratia  <dig> is a member of the enterobacteriaceae, we identified potential pho boxes based on the e. coli consensus sequence. a potential pho box was identified within the psts promoter region of serratia  <dig>  centred  <dig> bp upstream of the psts start codon . this suggested that, as could be expected based on regulation of the pstscab-phou genes in other bacteria, the pstscab-phou genes in serratia  <dig> may be regulated by phob. a putative pho box was also identified upstream of phob , centred  <dig> bp upstream of the phob start codon, suggesting that phobr may be auto-regulated via the putative pho box.

β-glucuronidase activity produced from a chromosomal pstc::uida transcriptional fusion was measured in the presence or absence of a secondary mutation in phob. the pstc::uida fusion strain does not contain a functional pst transporter and is therefore believed to mimic low phosphate conditions. these data showed that, in the presence of functional phob, pstc was expressed constitutively throughout growth . expression was dramatically reduced following inactivation of phob, indicating that phob activates expression of the pst operon in serratia  <dig> .

insertions within phobr abolish upregulation of secondary metabolism and qs in the psts mutant
it was hypothesised that the upregulation of pig, car and qs in a serratia  <dig> pst mutant was mediated via the phobr two-component system. assessment of pig, car and qs phenotypes in psts, phob and psts, phor double mutants confirmed that phob and phor were responsible for the upregulation of secondary metabolism in a psts mutant background. the psts mutant was increased for pig , car  and ahl  production compared with the wt . however, the psts, phob and psts, phor double mutants were restored to wt levels for pig, car and ahl production in lb . single phob or phor mutations had no effect on pig, car or ahl production . as it has been previously shown that upregulation of car in response to a pst mutation is mediated via the upregulation of qs  <cit> , we focused on the effects on piga and smai expression for the remainder of this study.

insertions within phobr abolish transcriptional upregulation of piga and smai in the psts mutant
phenotypic analysis showed that phobr are required for the upregulation of secondary metabolism and qs in response to mutation of the pstscab-phou operon . to confirm that these effects are exerted at the transcriptional level, primer extension analysis was used to assess levels of the piga and smai transcripts throughout growth in wt, psts mutant and psts, phob double mutant strains. the abundance of piga mrna in the psts, phob double mutant was restored to levels similar to those displayed in wt serratia  <dig> . a chromosomal piga::lacz transcriptional fusion was used to confirm this result; a 3-fold increase in piga transcription was observed in a psts mutant, this was restored to wt levels following a secondary mutation in phob or phor . the upregulation of smai transcription in the psts mutant was also abolished by a phob mutation . this is consistent with the hypothesis that phob, either directly or indirectly, activates expression of piga and smai in response to constitutive phosphorylation by phor as a result of the psts insertion.

insertions within pstscab-phou result in increased transcription of rap
a complex network of regulators controls secondary metabolism in serratia  <dig>  <cit> . therefore, it was possible that the effects on pig and ahl production, in response to a pst mutation, were mediated via one or more of these regulators. to test if the effect on smai and piga transcription was mediated through any of the known secondary metabolite regulators, the expression of chromosomal lacz transcriptional fusions in pigp, pigq, pigr, pigs, pigt, pigv, pigw, pigx, pigz, rap and carr was assessed throughout growth in the presence or absence of a psts::mini-tn5sm/sp insertion . no effect was seen on any of the regulatory genes except for rap. the expression of rap was increased by  <dig> -fold in the psts mutant . rap is a putative slya/marr-family transcriptional regulator. as expression of rap is known to be regulated by qs  <cit> , the effect of a pstc mutation on expression of a rap::lacz transcriptional fusion was assessed in a smai mutant background. a mutation within the pstscab-phou operon was still able to activate rap transcription , in the absence of functional smai, indicating that this effect is via both qs -dependent and -independent pathways .

phob activates expression from the piga and rap promoters in an e. coli system
to investigate the control of the piga, rap and smai promoters in more detail, an e. coli plasmid-based system was used . β-galactosidase activity was measured from e. coli strains carrying the piga, rap or smai promoters, inserted upstream of a promoterless lacz gene  in the presence or absence of serratia  <dig> phob, encoded by plasmid pta <dig>  transcription from the piga and rap promoters increased in the presence of pta <dig>  indicating that these genes may be activated by phob . unfortunately, the level of expression from the smai promoter was negligible in this system . therefore, it was not possible to determine whether phob was modulating transcription from the smai promoter. in the e. coli system, the degree of activation from both the piga and rap promoters in the presence of phob is comparable with the levels of activation observed using chromosomal piga::lacz and rap::lacz transcriptional fusions as a result of psts/pstc mutation in serratia  <dig> . putative weak pho boxes were identified within the promoter regions of piga and smai, overlapping the predicted - <dig> sequences and centred  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively, upstream of the transcriptional start sites, which were previously mapped by primer extension  <cit>  . a putative weak pho box was also identified within the rap promoter, centred  <dig> bp upstream of the rap start codon . the presence of putative pho boxes suggest that phob may directly activate expression of piga, smai and rap, although this has not yet been shown experimentally. in the e. coli reporter assays described, it is possible that serratia  <dig> phob may show activity in the absence of the cognate serratia  <dig> histidine kinase, phor, due to cross-regulation by non-cognate e. coli histidine kinases, or as a result of low level activity of the unphosphorylated serratia  <dig> phob.

pi regulates secondary metabolism and qs in serratia 39006
in other species, phobr upregulates expression of multiple genes when the cell is starved for pi . as pi has been shown to control secondary metabolism in multiple species  <cit> , we investigated whether secondary metabolism and qs in serratia  <dig> were also modified by pi limitation. growth of serratia  <dig> in phosphate-limiting medium  without the addition of  <dig> mm kh2po <dig> resulted in an increase in pig  and ahl  production , reminiscent of the effects of psts mutations. β-galactosidase activity from strains containing chromosomal piga::lacz, smai::lacz and rap::lacz fusions grown in pl medium without the addition of  <dig> mm kh2po <dig> was also assessed. pi limitation resulted in increased transcription of piga  and smai  compared with pi replete conditions , although there was not a clear increase in rap transcription . these experiments demonstrate that low pi, like pstscab-phou mutations, controls the transcription of piga and smai to up-regulate secondary metabolism and qs. however, in each instance, the fold increase in response to pi limitation is lower  than that observed in a pst mutant. as the increase in rap transcription in a pst mutant is below 2-fold, a lesser change, in response to pi limitation, may be below the level of detection.

we predicted that a psts mutation would be epistatic to the effects of pi on secondary metabolism and qs. in a psts mutant, pi limitation did not result in an increase in maximal pig production , although slightly premature production of pig was observed . in addition, pi limitation resulted in only a small  increase in ahl production in a psts mutant . taken together, the data suggest that in serratia  <dig>  as in other bacteria, mutation of psts mimics the effect of pi-limiting media. however, other mechanisms also appear to play a role, facilitating the small increase in ahl production observed in response to pi limitation despite the absence of a functional pstscab-phou system.

discussion
there are multiple studies identifying environmental factors that effect pig production in serratia spp., including the effects of salt concentration, temperature, oxygen availability and multiple metal ion concentrations  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanism underlying most of these responses has not been elucidated. here, we investigate the molecular mechanism by which pi limitation affects secondary metabolism in the enteric bacteria serratia  <dig> 

it was previously shown that a psts mutation in serratia  <dig> resulted in the upregulation of qs and secondary metabolism  <cit> . here, we demonstrate that these effects are occurring via the phobr two-component system, since a secondary mutation in phobr abolished the effects of a psts mutation. in addition, we confirm that qs and secondary metabolism are upregulated in response to pi limitation, and that this is occurring primarily via the pstscab-phou transport system. we also demonstrate that expression of rap is upregulated in response to a psts mutation. rap is an activator of pig and car, and a repressor of surfactant production and swarming motility, in serratia  <dig>  <cit> . rap shares similarity with the slya/marr-family global transcription factor, rova, which regulates genes required for host colonization in yersinia spp.  <cit> . therefore, our results indicate that three global transcriptional regulators, rap, smar and phob, are involved in mediating the effects of pi limitation on secondary metabolism in serratia  <dig> 

a mutation of the pstscab-phou genes resulted in a clear increase in pig and ahl production, and a clear increase in piga, smai and rap transcription. however, following pi limitation, the effects on secondary metabolism and gene expression were less dramatic. the degree of activation of pig and ahl production, and piga transcription, was approximately 35% lower following pi limitation than the levels of activation observed in a psts mutant. in addition, a clear increase in rap transcription was not observed following pi limitation. it is possible that this reduced effect is due to the fact that a psts mutant is constitutively mimicking extreme pi limitation. however, when wt cells are transferred to phosphate limiting media, there may be phosphate carry over from the initial inoculum, and the cells may utilise existing intracellular phosphate stores, for example inorganic polyphosphate, before phosphate starvation occurs. as the increase in rap transcription in a psts mutant is below 2-fold, we believe that a 35% reduction in activation, in response to pi limitation, may be undetectable. an alternative explanation could be that rap is induced via phobr, but not in response to pi limitation. previously, phobr has been shown to activate expression of the asr  gene, but pi limitation did not activate asr expression  <cit> . in addition, there is also evidence that phob can be activated by non-partner histidine kinases, in the absence of phor  <cit> . this has lead to the hypothesis that phobr may activate genes in response to a variety of environmental cues, in addition to pi limitation  <cit> .

it may not be entirely accurate to describe the effect of a psts mutation, or pi limitation, on qs as 'upregulation'. for qs to function correctly, it is the absolute concentrations of the ahl signal molecule that is critical, not the amount per cell  <cit> . due to the growth defect observed following a psts mutation or pi limitation, the amount of ahl per cell is increased, but the absolute value remains comparable to wt/pi excess conditions. therefore, it may be more accurate to state that the upregulation of smai transcription, following psts mutation or pi limitation, allows maintenance of qs regulon control despite the reduced growth rate. this idea is supported by the fact that although carr, pigq, pigr and rap are all regulated by qs in serratia  <dig>  <cit> , only rap transcription is upregulated in response to a psts mutation. our experiments indicate that, in response to a pst mutation, rap is activated independently of qs, and that activation may be mediated via phob.

activation of cara expression, following psts mutation, was previously reported to be dependent on the upregulation of qs  <cit> . however, as rap is also an activator of cara transcription  <cit> , it is possible that rap, rather than qs, is responsible for the activation of cara following a psts mutation. we propose that a dual mechanism, involving  the alleviation of smar repression at lower cell density, via upregulation of smai, and  increased levels of rap via phob mediated transcriptional activation, is responsible for the increase in cara expression following psts mutation. in the absence of ahl , cara transcription is essentially abolished  <cit>  and hence, further activation by rap, in response to a psts mutation, might not be possible.

based on our data, we propose a model by which pi limitation results in upregulation of secondary metabolism via multiple inter-linked pathways . in response to pi limitation, or following mutation of the pstscab genes, phob is activated by phosphorylation  <cit> . phob~p can then activate expression of genes involved in the serratia phosphate response which includes smai, piga and rap. activation of piga expression causes increased pig production. upregulation of smai allows appropriate derepression by smar  <cit> . this allows activation of piga, cara and rap transcription. rap, which is activated via qs and the phosphate response, can then further activate cara and piga transcription. this results in upregulation of both car and pig production via multiple pathways.

multiple studies have linked pi limitation to enhanced secondary metabolite production  <cit> . however, the complex molecular mechanisms underlying phosphate-mediated regulation have proven difficult to elucidate. extensive studies in streptomyces species have shown that phopr  activates secondary metabolism in response to pi limitation, including biosynthesis of undecylprodigiosin, a tripyrrole closely related to pig  <cit> . however, in streptomyces, inactivation of phop or deletion of phopr also activates secondary metabolism  <cit> . in contrast, deletion of phob and/or phor in serratia  <dig> had no impact on secondary metabolism, demonstrating clear differences between the regulatory mechanisms employed by these distantly related bacteria. although the requirement for increased secondary metabolism under conditions of phosphate limitation is unclear, it has been proposed that enhanced secondary metabolism allows the production of compounds which may, for example, directly antagonise other microorganisms or act as signalling molecules, thereby providing producing organisms with a competitive advantage under nutrient deprived conditions  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have established that via the global transcriptional regulators phob, smar and rap, multiple inter-linked pathways are acting to upregulate secondary metabolism in serratia  <dig> under conditions of pi limitation, highlighting the importance of pig and car production under these conditions.
