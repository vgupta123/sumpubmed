BACKGROUND
the fundamental mechanisms that generate and shape genomic diversity – mutation, recombination, selection and drift – were well known before the genomic era. despite advances, the variation of a eukaryote species' genome from individual to individual is still not well understood. a significant source of intraspecific diversity, variation in the copy number of genomic elements  is defined  <cit>  as deletions or duplications of any genomic elements, except transposons, greater than one thousand base pairs . emerging research suggests that genic cnv contributes to major changes in chromosomal organization and content between species, and disease in humans  <cit> . a number of methods have become available for detecting cnv, all facilitated by the availability of sequence information derived from analysis of the single or low copy fraction of the genome.

heterochromatic repeats form a second genomic component subject to variation. no consistent term is in use to define copy number variation in transposons, transposon-related, centromeric and ribosomal repeats, which make up a considerable portion of eukaryotic genomes and are typically in heterochromatin  <cit> . to facilitate discussion, we will designate this latter type of variation as repeat number variation . rnv can arise rapidly  <cit> . the significance of rnv is unclear – in the human population rnv has been reported both as general with no effect, and associated with disease  <cit> . change in ribosomal rna genes  have been reported in plants  <cit> .

although several cases of repeat variations have been documented  <cit> , rnv is harder to characterize than cnv. the larger repeat rich sequences of the genome cannot be tiled into contigs for physical mapping without ambiguity, due to their repetitive nature, and gaps of uncertain but megabase size persist in the sequenced genomes' repeats, including the human, in particular in centromeres  <cit> . for that reason major repeats have been excluded from the definition of a sequenced genome  <cit> .

the uncertainty in the repeated component is illustrated by the status of the nuclear genome of the model organism arabidopsis, one of the smallest in the vascular plants. the initial arabidopsis thaliana genome sequence was announced by the arabidopsis genome initiative   <cit>  in  <dig>  with the 1c  genome estimated to be  <dig> million base pairs ;  <dig> mbp had been sequenced, with work continuing on the centromeres and 5s rdna. subtelomeric rdna arrays on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  were not sequenced. the centromere structure and composition was explored by several groups. work with pulsed field electrophoresis of the  <dig> bp centromeric repeat  <cit>  was followed by its genetic mapping  <cit> ; both better established its aggregate size and location on the chromosomes. a karyotype developed using fish  <cit>  with this repeat and a component of the pericentromeric athila retrotransposon further refined the centromeric regions; the agi sequence data and use of fish  <cit>  enabled more detailed elucidation of structure and chromatin status of the centromeres. the sizes of all  <dig> centromeres were assessed through partial sequencing and physical mapping  <cit>  leading to an estimated size of  <dig> mbp, three times the initial agi estimate of  <dig> to  <dig> mbp, and placing the total genome size near  <dig> mbp. these conclusions were supported by the work of bennett et al.  <cit> ; table  <dig> presents this changing understanding of the arabidopsis genome size.

even with this imprecision in the repeated fraction the arabidopsis thaliana nuclear genome is one of the best-characterized eukaryotic genomes, and provides an opportunity to better understand rnv in plants. a recent survey of arabidopsis accessions through flow cytometry suggested variation in genome size  <cit> ; it was not determined whether rnv or cnv was associated with these changes. additionally, we do not know whether the differences detected by flow cytometry, which is based on the fluorescence of dna-bound dye, reflect fluctuations in dna content  <cit>  or other differences in the status of the nuclear genome. for example, chromatin status significantly affects cytometric fluorescence measurements  <cit> .

to explore rnv in the arabidopsis thaliana genome, we measured the major repeats in several accessions by two different techniques. we documented considerable variation, particularly in the 5s ribosomal genes. interestingly, the estimates of genome size inferred from repeat variation could only be fitted partially to measurements of total genomic size estimated by flow cytometry of nuclei. comparative genomic hybridization of the col- <dig> and loh- <dig> accessions displayed cnv, but the observed variation could not account for the observed large differences in flow cytometric fluorescence of their nuclei.

RESULTS
qpcr measurements of the major repeats
we used quantitative pcr  to measure the amount of five major heterochromatic repeats in each of five accessions , relative to the col- <dig> plant's genome, which we used as a comparison standard in all assays. the sequences assayed are the  <dig> base pair centromeric repeat , fragments of the 18s and 25s ribosomal rna genes, orf <dig> of the high copy number pericentromeric athila transposable element, and the 5s rna gene. in the most recent  arabidopsis genome there are  <dig> pericentromeric athila genes totaling  <dig>  mbp. the 5s arrays  <cit>  are only partly sequenced; their aggregate size is approximately  <dig> mbp, updating the estimate of campell et al.  <cit>  to a  <dig> mbp arabidopsis genome.

measurements of the relative amount of the major heterochromatic repeats in the five accessions are presented in table  <dig>  we assayed one individual in each accession by both quantitative pcr and nylon filter array hybridization, and assayed an additional individual, a sibling, in each accession using only qpcr.

units are based on the col standard . repeats in individual  were assayed using both filter array genomic hybridization and qpcr, its sibling  was measured with qpcr only. filter values are presented in regular font, qpcr in bold. in the filter arrays, probes for the 18s and 25s subunits of the 45s rdna gene were pooled; the same value is presented for each subunit. the number of observations for each value given is  <dig> for the filter assays and averages  <dig> for qpcr. ind.: individual.

se: propagated standard error of the mean, presented as percent of mean value. for measurement and error propagation details see methods.

to achieve accuracy it was important to measure the input template dna. although we employed careful concentration measurements , we decided to standardize our qpcr measurements using the single copy genes roc <dig> and act <dig>  figure  <dig> panel  illustrates the relationship between the relative copy number of these two standards for the different input templates. the strong correlation  validated their use and indicate that they have balanced copy number in the accessions studied ; at the same time the results document the capability of qpcr to precisely measure template amounts. we also assayed the 18s and 25s subcomponents of the 45s repeat separately to assess the utility of the method in our study: their rnv among accessions should be identical. panel  presents table 2's qpcr results for the ribosomal rna genes; linear regression between the separate subcomponents gives a coefficient of determination r <dig> =  <dig>  , indicating good agreement.

the qpcr assays  reveal the presence of broad polymorphism in copy number of the repeats; the measured amounts of the centromeric repeat, the pericentromeric transposable element athila, and 45s rdna vary by over a factor of two, and the 5s rdna cluster by a factor of four, between the lowest and highest.

nylon filter array hybridization measurements of the major repeats
filter arrays can provide an alternative measurement of the copy number of a repeat. we deposited each target sequence in multiple slots of the filter array to provide repeated measurements per array . labeled probes were hybridized to the filter array of genomic dna and detected via fluorescence. we pooled the 18s and 25s rna genes' probes in our filter measurements; these and the measurements of the other major repeats are presented in table  <dig>  the degree of variation in each repeat is consistent with that observed by the qpcr analysis. figure  <dig> illustrates the relationship between the measured repeat amounts for the two methods. the relationship is excellent for 5s, good for athila, mediocre for 45s, and bad for cen. the discrepancies may be explained by the different specificity of the qpcr and filter array: the first depends on near perfect identity between primers and the corresponding target sequences, the second is more tolerant of variation between labeled dna and the target on the filter array. this difference is consistent with the poor relationship displayed by the measures of the cen repeats, which are known to vary  <cit> . it does not explain, however, the discrepancy in the measurements of the 45s rdna, which is highly conserved within genomes. in conclusion, this comparison suggests confidence in the 5s measurements, but also illustrates the difficulty of measuring the repeats. both methods may perform suboptimally in the pericentromeric athila sections, which have experienced multiple transposition events into those sequences.

fish analysis
the  <dig> to  <dig> fold measured variation in 5s rdna repeat is substantial. to validate these observations, we prepared cytological slide mounts of anthers from the reference accession col- <dig> and the accession with the highest measured 5s rdna copy number, loh- <dig>  to achieve uniformity of hybridization we mounted and hybridized samples from both ecotypes side by side on the same slide. we probed the nuclei with a fluorescently labeled fragment of the 5s gene. we omitted protease treatment of the nuclei, a step that usually enhances hybridization efficiency, to achieve the best dynamic response. pictures were taken at similar settings and representative raw images  from the assays are given in figure  <dig>  the panels present images of meiotic pollen mother cells in the two accessions: note that the background fluorescence displayed by the nucleoplasm is comparable in the two samples. the set of loh- <dig> 5s rdna signals was scored as significantly brighter than col- <dig>  by four observers;  <dig> col- <dig> and  <dig> loh- <dig> cells were scored in each set. the in situ results demonstrated that the two accessions have a qualitatively different hybridization signal to the 5s rdna probe, corroborating differences in the amount of the 5s repeat in the two accessions.

sibling variation
we measured the copy number of each 18s and 25s rrna gene in siblings of each accession . for both subunits the difference in measured copy number between siblings is less than the standard error of the mean. the qpcr assays identified larger differences in the other repeats between siblings than the average 10% in the 18s & 25s ribosomal rna genes, with a mean difference of 24% in 5s rdna, 21% in the  <dig> bp repeat, and 16% in athila. while arabidopsis is almost entirely a selfing plant and is expected to be homozygous, development of polymorphism in heterochromatin of inbred plants has been reported  <cit> . overall the measured differences between siblings are a small fraction of that determined among the accessions; over repeated generations, however, drift in the copy number of these elements could contribute to large differences.

fluorescence measurements of nuclei by flow cytometry
we measured the fluorescence of propidium iodide stained nuclei of the sequenced accession col- <dig>  using commercially-available alcohol-fixed chicken erythrocyte nuclei from becton-dickinson as the internal size standard, and taking the gallus gallus 1c genome size to be  <dig> mbp  <cit> , we derived a size of  <dig> mbp  for col- <dig>  this is close to the  <dig>  mbp measurement by bennett et al.  <cit> , which was based on the gallus and additional standards, but 25% larger than the  <dig> mbp estimated by the agi  <cit> . our estimate is also much lower than the  <dig> mbp value estimated by schmuths et al.  <cit>  using raphanus sativus  as an internal size standard   <cit> .

we tested the five accessions used in the repeat variation measurements for their nuclear fluorescence response by flow cytometry. the inferred genome sizes are presented in figure  <dig> relative to col- <dig>  two accessions, ta- <dig> and br- <dig>  have mean measured genome size smaller than the sequenced accession col- <dig>  and three, is- <dig>  tamm- <dig> and loh- <dig>  are larger. the fluorescent response of loh- <dig> is consistent with a  <dig> mb larger genome than col- <dig> 

fig.  <dig> shows that measured differences in genome size between nearest neighbor accessions  are not always significant. this could in part be due to the precision of the method and also in part to variation in genome size among siblings. panel  shows that genome size variation in siblings is not significant for three accessions , but is for the three others . to determine whether that variation and the small mean differences between nearest neighbors are accurate will require further study. we selected these accessions for this study as they spanned the genome size range of the  <dig> in our initial survey of arabidopsis. the study measurements were made using a separate set of individuals; survey results are available here in three additional files .

comparative genomic hybridization assays
the unusually high nuclear fluorescence response displayed by loh- <dig> suggested the possibility of large scale cnv in this accession. we wanted to determine, therefore, if loh- <dig> had one or more segmental duplications of chromosomes. we employed comparative genomic hybridization  with spotted oligonucleotide gene microarrays to assay the copy number of genic sequences in loh- <dig>  compared with the sequenced columbia accession . the microarray oligos are designed from known genes, est sequences and predicted transcripts. a number of transposable elements , a class chiefly closely associated with centromeres and nearby sequences, are present on the array. while represented, this class of genes is not present in the quantity in our array data, especially on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  relative to their known presence in pericentromeric regions of the genome. this array in addition cannot assay the copy number of intergenic sequences or the centromere cores as both are absent from the set; neither are the ribosomal rna genes represented.

after quality control of the hybridization data, some  <dig>  hybridized features remained for this analysis. figure  <dig> presents the hybridization results. values charted are the base  <dig> logarithm of loh- <dig> feature intensities, relative to columbia; see the caption for a detailed explanation. the suitability of this array system for cnv analysis are demonstrated in panels  and . the ratio observed with self versus self demonstrates the linear response of the hybridization ratio. in contrast, when a known aneuploid of arabidopsis  <cit>  is compared to the diploid, chromosomes present in three copies can be readily identified by the ratio of aneuploid/diploid hybridization. therefore, segmental duplications or deletions that encompass more than several contiguous array features are readily detected. such is case in the comparison of loh- <dig> vs col- <dig>  two regions whose microarray features display ratios consistent with deletion in loh- <dig> are detected in the euchromatic arms that flank centromere  <dig>  one, beginning between at1g <dig> and at1g <dig> and ending between at1g <dig> and at1g <dig>  is centered at  <dig>  mbp for approximately  <dig>  bp . the other, beginning between at1g <dig> and at1g <dig> and ending between at1g <dig> and at1g <dig>  is centered at  <dig>  mbp for approximately  <dig>  bp . a region on chromosome  <dig> encoding a cluster of putative resistance genes is present in higher copy number in loh- <dig>  consistent with expansion of these genes, beginning near at4g <dig> and ending near at4g <dig>  centered at  <dig>  mbp for approximately  <dig>  bp. unequal crossing over between tandemly repeated resistance genes is known  <cit>  to result in copy number variation.

in addition, a moving average of the ratio of several features dips in value close to the centromeres of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the pericentromeric region's ratios, as defined by the presence of athila elements in the tigr sequence, have a mean of  <dig> . the same value for the chromosome arms is  <dig> . this indicates that pericentromeric features in these chromosomes did not hybridize to loh- <dig> dna probably because the corresponding genes are either absent or diverged in this strain. such degree of polymorphism is expected because the pericentromeric features are enriched in transposons and pseudogenes, whose loss or degeneration should be neutral and not selected against. the cgh centromeric trend cannot be taken to indicate that there is a net loss of pericentromeric genes in loh- <dig> compared to col- <dig>  the array was constructed based on col- <dig> sequence and it therefore cannot provide information on sequences that may be present in loh- <dig> and absent in col- <dig>  we conclude that the analysis does not support the existence of large segmental duplication involving the known genes of col- <dig> 

modeling genome size variation
there is a discrepancy between the a. thaliana col- <dig> genome size predicted by agi's accounting of sequenced dna , and that inferred from flow cytometry . one possible explanation is that flow cytometry has a systemic bias. for example, a difference in condensation of chromatin between the internal gallus standard and the test genome might perturb the measurement and produce a large error . the concentration of propidium iodide we used is supposed to minimize these effects  <cit> . nonetheless, we tested the effect of chromatin remodeling by comparing individuals of the landsberg erecta accession and its ddm <dig> mutant, finding only about  <dig> mb mean difference, within the range exhibited by the wild-type individuals . the ddm <dig> mutation introduces profound changes in chromatin state  <cit> ; chromatin changes of the type observed in ddm <dig> mutants, could contribute to apparent genome size differences but are unlikely to be the main determinant of the loh- <dig> to col- <dig> difference.

an alternative hypothesis is that the repetitive fraction of the genome is different than estimated by the agi. we developed a data model to assess whether our measured repeat fractions could account for the different genome sizes we determined with flow cytometry. the model first calculates the size of the variable genome in each individual as the size in mbp of each of the heterochromatic elements in the sequenced col- <dig> genome times the individual's qpcr-measured repeat amount relative to col-0; the combined size of the basal genic and intergenic regions  is added to give the total genome size. given that the sequenced genome's heterochromatin repeat sizes are not known with precision, the model tests a series of sizes for each repeat, drawing on published size estimates to establish a range.

because of the unsettled understanding of the size of the arabidopsis genome, we determined separate sets of these values for arabidopsis genome sizes of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mbp. as an example, assuming the true col- <dig> genome size is  <dig> mbp, the model alternately tries several sizes for each repeat in col- <dig> in turn, then calculating the modeled genome size for each accession. for this the size of the repeat in each accession, relative to its size in col- <dig>  is used. we designed a merit function  <cit>  to assess agreement between the flow cytometry-measured and model-predicted genome sizes, and used it to identify col- <dig> repeat sizes giving the best overall fit. conceptually, the set of repeat sizes giving the smallest difference between the modeled and measured genome sizes is chosen. in the example, a 5s array size of  <dig> mbp, along with the other repeat sizes for a  <dig> mbp col- <dig> genome, minimizes the error between modeled and measured genome sizes. we used only the qpcr results in this analysis.

we found  that variation in the four large repeat arrays we assayed account for up to  <dig> percent of the variance in measured genome size among the accessions. a col- <dig> genome of  <dig> mbp generates the best overall fit to the repeat data, and modeled repeat sizes fall within published estimates, except for the 5s array. the accession with the largest measured genome, loh- <dig>  could challenge the model due to its extreme measured genome size and pattern of variation. when omitting this accession from the model the assayed differences in four repeats explain up to  <dig> percent of measured genome size variation, and the 5s array is put at  <dig> mbp in a  <dig> mbp genome. the modeling work indicates that about half of the genome size variation suggested by flow cytometry can be validated by measuring the four major repeats of the arabidopsis thaliana genome. discrepancies between the measured and modeled genome sizes may result from variation in repeats present but not modeled, and uncertainty in the measured repeat fraction sizes.

CONCLUSIONS
our analyses are consistent with substantial repeat number polymorphism for 5s and 45s ribosomal genes among accession of a. thaliana. differences are also suggested for centromeric and pericentromeric repeats. the largest difference for 5s ribosomal genes from the col- <dig> standard was observed in accession loh- <dig>  which is also the most extreme of those tested in propidium iodide fluorescence of nuclei. as over  <dig> repeat families have been identified in arabidopsis  <cit> , our study is not exhaustive. expansion and contraction in these, and creation of new families in individual accessions, will likely continue to contribute to divergence within the species and might underlie what we observed in loh- <dig> 

our analysis also points to the difficulties in measuring the repeated fraction of the genome and suggests that independent validation of genome size should be sought in addition to flow cytometric measurements. proper accounting of the repeated genomic fraction may require nonbiased parallel shotgun sequencing methods; see  <cit>  as an example of recent advances.
