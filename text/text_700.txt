BACKGROUND
the skeleton is a multifunctional system with physiological roles in providing a rigid framework and support, acting as the primary storage site for mineral salts, and functioning in hematopoiesis. while several cell types are known to contribute to bone formation, the major player is a common bone matrix-secreting cell type, the osteoblast.

chondrocytes, which play critical roles at several stages of endochondral ossification, and osteoblasts are derived from common precursors, and both intrinsic cues and signals from extrinsic cues play critical roles in the lineage decision of these cell types  <cit> . the targeted mutation of runx <dig> or osterix, transcription regulators highly expressed in osteoblast progenitors, result in the lack of mature osteoblasts, demonstrating that these factors are essential for osteoblastogenesis  <cit> . several studies have shown that cell fate commitment within the osteoblast lineage requires sequential, stage-specific, ihh and canonical wnt/β-catenin signaling to promote osteoblastic, and also to block chondrogenic, differentiation programs  <cit> . another recent report shows that the inhibitory effect of sox <dig> on osteoblastic and chondrocyte maturation via repression of runx <dig> function is an essential mechanism for osteochondroprogenitor cell fate determination  <cit> .

most bones are formed by endochondral ossification in which mesenchymal condensations differentiate into chondrocytes, forming a cartilaginous template prefiguring the future skeletal elements. the perichondrium and perioseum are generated around the nascent cartilage, and cells surrounding the zone of hypertrophic chondrocytes begin to differentiate into osteoblasts. sox <dig> is expressed in all chondroprogenitors and chondrocytes except hypertrophic chondrocytes, and is required for the sequential steps of chondrogenesis before and after mesenchymal condensations  <cit> .

thus, in osteoblastic differentiation, the functional mechanisms of transcriptional regulators have been well elucidated, however the exact roles of extrinsic molecules in osteoblastic differentiation are less clear. in our microarray screening aiming to identify novel molecular pathways in chondrocyte differentiation, we identified a novel gene encoding a transmembrane protein, which is predominantly expressed in osteoblasts during mouse development. we named this gene obif  and performed functional analyses using cell culture models.

we found that obif overexpression in the preosteoblastic mc3t3-e <dig> cells induces differentiation and maturation of osteoblasts. knockdown of obif suppresses osteoblastic differentiation of mc3t3-e <dig> cells. we also present data demonstrating that the extracellular domains of both mouse and human obif proteins augment osteoblastic differentiation-induction activity, suggesting that obif acts in a ligand-like manner. together, our results suggest that obif is involved in the differentiation of osteoblasts through intercellular interaction during development.

RESULTS
identification and intracellular localization of obif protein
with the aim of identifying novel molecules involved in chondrocyte differentiation, we performed a microarray screening using a mouse chondroprogenitor cell line, atdc <dig> . we extracted total rna at day  <dig> , day  <dig> , and day  <dig> . with the gene expression profile analysis, we identified  <dig> probe sets that showed more than a three-fold change in expression level at day  <dig> or day  <dig> relative to day  <dig>  from among these genes, we selected  <dig> genes that have not as yet been known to be associated with chondrogenesis and osteoblastogenesis, and further investigated their expression patterns. we found one gene that shows an expression pattern predominantly in the skeletal systems of mouse embryos and up-regulation upon differentiation in atdc <dig> cells. on the basis of our functional assay, we named this gene obif    which is the same gene with transmembrane protein  <dig> .

the deduced amino acid sequence of mouse obif contains a signal sequence, a single transmembrane domain, and a glutamic acid-rich region. this gene is conserved among species from chicken to human . we also isolated a human obif cdna from commercially available human fetal brain rna by rt-pcr. the genomes of zebra fish and xenopus tropicalis also contain sequences that are homologous to mouse obif . we then examined the subcellular localization of obif. using a retrovirus vector, we overexpressed a flag-tagged obif in various cell lines. to confirm the obif expression, we performed western blot analysis using anti-flag m <dig> antibody and the antibody that we raised against obif . with both of these antibodies, we detected a strong band of approximately  <dig> kd, a weak band of approximately  <dig> kd, and broad bands of  <dig> -  <dig> kd in all cell lines in which obif was overexpressed . using the on-line predictor method netoglyc  <dig>   <cit> , we found several potential o-glycosylation sites between the signal sequence and transmembrane domain of obif . this observation strongly suggests that obif is a type ia transmembrane protein in which the n-terminal region is frequently modified post-transcriptionally. next, we examined the intracellular localization of obif using mc3t3-e <dig> cells stably overexpressing mouse obif  or human obif  by immunostaining . obif/obif are mainly localized to the plasma membrane. this observation is coincident with the result of western blot analysis on the subcellular fractionated samples , in which the microsomal fraction contained an abundant amount of obif compared with the cytoplasmic fraction.

obif transcript is expressed in osteoblast-lineage cells
early mouse embryos were examined for obif transcript expression by whole mount in situ hybridization . no clear hybridization signal was detected at e <dig>  . at e <dig> , the signal was seen in the whole limb buds . at e <dig> , the stage the cartilage primordiums were formed in the limb buds, obif transcripts were observed in the areas between these primordiums .

we then compared the expression of obif with that of the chondrocytic marker sox <dig> . in the forelimb bud, obif is expressed in a broad region at e <dig>  . at e <dig>  and e <dig> , the signal is down-regulated in the proximal region where mesenchymal cells condense and differentiate into chondrocytes, as evidenced by the onset of sox <dig> expression . at e <dig>  and e <dig> , while sox <dig> shows a prominent signal in future digit regions, the expression of obif is most abundant in the interdigital mesenchyme . as in developing limb buds, obif expression is complementary to that of sox <dig> in other tissues . for instance, obif is expressed in cells between the condensations that form the future ribs at e <dig>   and in the osteogenic mesenchyme surrounding meckel's cartilage at e <dig>  . however, we could not detect obif transcripts in the chondrocyte-lineage cells such as the cartilage condensation and meckel's cartilage where sox <dig> is expressed .

to investigate the obif transcript expression at later embryonic stages, we performed section in situ hybridization with several markers pertaining to endochondral ossification . collagen <dig> and osteocalcin  are markers for mature osteoblasts. osteopontin  is a marker for both terminally differentiated chondrocytes and osteoblasts, and collagen  <dig>  is a marker for hypertrophic chondrocytes. interestingly, the expression of obif was observed in the osteoblasts. in e <dig>  humerus, obif transcripts were detected in the perichondrium of the hypertrophic chondrocyte region where collagen <dig> is expressed, but were absent from more centrally located chondrocytic cells . at e <dig> , when ocn is not yet significantly expressed, obif is detected both in the prospective bone collar region marked with collagen <dig> and in the developing bone trabeculae marked with opn . at e <dig> , obif expression overlaps with ocn but not with collagen <dig> .

next, we examined the expression of obif and runx <dig> in various tissues of  <dig> week-old mice by northern blot analysis . a  <dig>  kb band was detected in the tissues containing osteoblasts  and other tissues such as the brain and lung. the calvaria band was significantly stronger as compared with that of the brain or lung. high levels of obif expression at embryonic stages followed by decreased expression of obif at early postnatal stages suggest that obif works in both embryonic skeletal development and postnatal differentiation. during postnatal development, expression in calvaria and long bones decreases whereas runx <dig> expression is comparably maintained , suggesting that obif does not have an important role in mature adult tissues.

obif expression is up-regulated during osteoblastic differentiation in cell line models
several cell lines derived from mesenchymal tissues have been widely used to recapitulate in vivo cellular differentiation  <cit> . we used preosteoblastic mc3t3-e <dig> cells, myogenic c2c <dig> cells, and stromal st <dig> cells as osteoblast differentiation models, and chondrogenic atdc <dig> cells as a chondrocyte differentiation model. initially, the endogenous obif in these cells was examined in comparison with runx <dig> by northern blot analysis . in undifferentiated mc3t3-e <dig> cells only a faint signal was detected, however, upon induction by ascorbic acid  and β-glycerophosphate , obif transcripts dramatically increased . similarly, although atdc <dig> cells express almost no obif transcript in an undifferentiated state, obif expression is markedly up-regulated during differentiation induced by its  . nih3t <dig> cells express a low amount of obif and runx <dig> transcripts . in c2c <dig> cells, obif expression increased during osteoblastic differentiation induced by bmp <dig> . in st <dig> cells, obif expression increased during differentiation induced by ascorbic acid or wnt 3a .

endogenous obif protein is expressed in osteoblast-lineage cells
in order to investigate the localization of endogenous obif protein, we immunostained sections of embryonic forelimb and humerus using the anti-obif antibody . signals were observed in the perichondrium of the hypertrophic chondrocyte region, peripheral layers of the endochondral skeletal elements, and cells associated bone trabeculae including both the spindle-shaped osteoblasts and the cuboidal-shaped osteoblasts. in addition, we observed that obif appears to be expressed in the plasma membrane of osteoblasts . to verify the expression of obif protein in osteoblast-lineage cells, we performed double staining of the developing limb using the obif antibody with other osteoblastic markers such as alkaline-phosphatase  and collagen  <dig> . at late embryonic stages, co-localization of obif with alp or with collagen type i was observed in the femur  and hindlimb .

next, we examined obif protein expression in primary cultures of fetal mouse calvaria . when calvarial cells were sparsely cultured, no obvious obif signals were observed . on the other hand, when densely cultured cells were stimulated with osteoblastic differentiation medium, strong obif expression was detected . by western blot analysis using primary culture cells and mc3t3-e <dig> cells, the elevation of the protein level was observed during calvarial cell maturation .

the role of obif in osteoblastogenesis
we then performed cell differentiation analysis using the retrovirus vector. for the overexpression study, cells were infected with retroviruses expressing both obif and gfp through ires or expressing gfp only as a control. the infection efficiency was monitored by gfp expression . obif expression was confirmed by immunocytochemistry  and western blot analysis using anti-obif antibody . these results show that cultured cells can be infected efficiently  with retroviruses. these infected cells express gfp and/or obif protein even after extensive passaging. for gene knockdown, we made retroviruses expressing short hairpin rnas  against obif. first, we designed three different sirnas  and examined their knockdown effects . mc3t3-obif cells and atdc5-obif cells were transfected with sirna- <dig>  sirna- <dig>  sirna- <dig>  or control sirna and analyzed by western blotting. non-transfected mc3t3-obif cells and atdc5-obif cells were also electrophoresed. all of the sirnas against obif showed strong knockdown effects . next, we made retroviral constructs overlapping the effective sirna sequences, a control shrna , sh <dig> which sequence overlaps sirna- <dig> and sirna- <dig> sequences, and sh <dig> which sequence overlaps sirna- <dig> sequence. when infected, mc3t3-obif cells with sh <dig> retroviruses showed a strong knockdown effect and those with sh <dig> retroviruses showed a comparatively weak knockdown effect . using these retroviruses, we established cells stably expressing these shrnas and performed knockdown studies.

initially, we examined the effect of obif overexpression on cell growth . the proliferation rate decreased somewhat in mc3t3-obif cells compared with mc3t3-control  cells . the same effects of exogenous obif were observed in other cell lines, atdc <dig>  st <dig>  and c2c <dig> . on the other hand, mc3t3-sh <dig> and -sh <dig> cells showed almost the same cell growth as cells infected with control retrovirus  . this result indicates that effect of obif on cell differentiation described below is not mainly due to the effects on cell growth.

next, we investigated the relationship between obif expression and osteoblast differentiation. we first examined an early stage osteoblastic marker, alp activity. the retrovirally infected cells were cultured in osteoblast differentiation media and harvested at the indicated time points . while alp activity increased in a time-dependent manner both in mc3t3-obif and -cont cells, mc3t3-obif cells showed a significantly higher alp activity than the mc3t3-cont cells at all points examined . in contrast, the reduction of obif expression caused a significant decrease of alp activity at all time points examined . second, we cultured mc3t3-e <dig> cells in the differentiation-induction medium until mineralized nodules could be observed. mineralization was visualized by alizarin red staining and quantified by a biochemical assay for calcium. a significantly higher degree of mineralization was obtained in mc3t3-obif cells than in mc3t3-cont cells . a quantitative analysis of calcium by extraction of the calcified mineral also showed a higher calcium content in mc3t3-obif cells . in contrast, decreased mineralization was observed in mc3t3-sh <dig> cells and mc3t3-sh <dig> cells as compared with mc3t3-sh-cont cells . in addition, we examined the effect of human obif on mineralization and confirmed that it also promoted mineralization .

aiming to investigate the effect of obif at the molecular level, we examined the expression of osteoblast lineage-associated genes by northern blot analysis . in obif overexpression experiments, the mrna levels of the osteoblastic differentiation markers increased in mc3t3-obif cells compared with those in mc3t3-cont cells. in particular, the elevations of bsp and ocn mrna levels were prominent . in knockdown experiments, obif transcripts were almost completely abolished in mc3t3-sh <dig> cells and partially ablated in mc3t3-sh <dig> cells . as early and essential osteoblastic markers, we first examined runx <dig> and osx mrna levels . at day  <dig>  osx transcripts decreased in obif knocked down cells whereas runx <dig> transcripts were not influenced by obif levels. at day  <dig>  runx <dig> was down-regulated in mc3t3-sh <dig> cells while we could detect only faint evidence of obif mrna. to investigate the relationship between runx <dig> and obif, we established runx <dig> knocked down mc3t3-e <dig> cells  and compared with obif knocked down cells . in mc3t3-shrunx <dig> cells, obif was down-regulated whereas runx <dig> was not affected in mc3t3-sh <dig> cells at day  <dig>  these results concur with a previous report that suggests obif is a downstream gene of runx <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, obif promoters contain a number of putative runx <dig> binding sites in multiple species . next, we examined ocn mrna levels in obif knocked down cells . at day  <dig> and  <dig>  ocn was down-regulated in both mc3t3-sh <dig> and -sh <dig> cell. at day  <dig>  the ocn mrna level in mc3t3-sh <dig> cells is almost the same as that in the control cells whereas it is significantly lower in mc3t3-sh <dig> cells. in primary culture cells, ocn mrna was down-regulated in obif knocked-down cells .

extracellular domain of obif can promote osteoblastic differentiation
obif protein is a single pass transmembrane protein that localizes to the plasma membranes. in order to investigate the mechanism of obif function, we made two more retroviral constructs. one expresses the n-terminal extracellular domain , and the other expresses both the ecd and the transmembrane domain  . using retroviruses derived from these constructs, we established cells stably expressing partial obif proteins. both bands of the partial proteins detected by western blot were larger than their predicted sizes . immunocytochemistry analyses using an anti-flag antibody showed different subcellular localizations of these genes . proteins including the tm localized to the plasma membranes whereas a large amount of obif-ecd protein localized to the cytoplasm.

then, we examined the effects of partial obif proteins on the induction of alp activity and matrix mineralization. mc3t3-ecd and -ecd+tm cells showed strong alp activities similar to mc3t3-obif cells at all points examined . partial obif proteins also stimulated mineralization at days  <dig> and  <dig> . similar results were observed in experiments using retroviruses expressing partial proteins of human obif .

next, we generated an obif-fusion protein, consisting of the obif extracellular domain fused to an ap tag. bands of predicted sizes were detected in lysates from transfected cells by western blotting using an anti-ap antibody . on the other hand, in supernatants from transfected cells, bands of larger sizes were detected. when tested for binding to tissue sections and cultured cells, ap-obif  bound to bone tissues and differentiating mc3t3-e <dig> cells . in contrast, the control ap protein did not bind at detectable levels .

discussion
we have isolated and functionally characterized a novel plasma membrane protein, obif. obif is highly expressed in early and late stage osteoblasts of developing mouse embryos, and its transcripts increase during osteoblastic differentiation in several skeletal cell lines. in preosteoblastic mc3t3-e <dig> cells, differentiation, particularly matrix mineralization, is stimulated when obif is overexpressed, and inhibited when obif is knocked down. furthermore, we showed that the extracellular domain of obif protein can promote mc3t3-e <dig> differentiation like the full-length form of obif, suggesting that obif functions in a ligand-like manner.

although obif was originally isolated as a molecule that is up-regulated during atdc <dig> cell differentiation, we could not detect clear obif/obif expression in chondrocyte-lineage cells in mouse skeletal tissues. this seems due to obif up-regulation by cells surrounding the cartilage nodules during atdc <dig> differentiation.

osteoblastogenesis is a multistep process temporally controlled by transcription factors and secreted growth factors. the centerpiece of the transcriptional control of osteoblast differentiation is the runx2-dependent pathway. runx2-deficient mice have a cartilaginous skeleton without any osteoblasts, as osteoblast differentiation is arrested as early as e <dig>   <cit> . osterix, a zinc finger-containing protein that is known to be downstream of runx <dig>  is expressed in osteoblast progenitors, and mice without osterix also lack mature osteoblasts  <cit> . although other transcription factors, dlx5/ <dig>  msx1/ <dig>  ap- <dig> families, twist, and atf <dig>  have been reported to be involved in osteoblastic differentiation, exact roles of these factors and their relationship with runx <dig> remain to be elucidated  <cit> . a recent report suggests that obif  is one of the molecules downstream of runx <dig>  <cit> . our results are consistent with this report. however, obif expression is observed as early as runx <dig> expression in developing limb buds and during the differentiation of mc3t3-e <dig> cells. therefore, the genetic and cell biological relationships between obif and runx <dig> will need future studies, including analysis of obif and runx <dig> mutant mice.

in mouse embryos, cells expressing obif are observed in the periosteum, bone collars, and trabecular bones. the expression pattern of obif suggests that obif functions in osteoblastic development. in the multiple cell line models we used, endogenous obif is markedly upregulated during osteoblastic differentiation. these expression patterns strongly suggest that obif functions in osteoblastogenesis. in committed preosteoblastic mc3t3-e <dig> cells, obif exerts critical roles both in alp induction and in matrix mineralization. in obif overexpression and knockdown experiments, cell proliferation is mildly affected but the effect of obif expression levels on differentiation is more significant. thus we propose that obif may play a role in both proliferation and differentiation, but the primary effect of obif is on differentiation. when obif is knocked down in mc3t3-e <dig> cells, mrna levels of osx and ocn decrease proportionally to the obif transcripts, although runx <dig> is not significantly affected. and in a similar experiment using primary calvarial cells, the level of ocn transcript decreases in cells in which obif was knocked down. these results suggest that obif protein is involved in the late differentiation of osteoblast-lineage cells.

partial proteins including the ecd of both human and mouse obif stimulated osteoblastic differentiation in mc3t3-e <dig> cells as well as the full-length obif protein. these results suggest that the ecd is sufficient to stimulate osteoblastic differentiation, and the physiological function of obif is mediated by cell-cell or cell-matrix interaction as a ligand. the binding activity of ap-obif  to bone tissues and differentiating mc3t3-e <dig> cells supports the hypothesis that an obif receptor-like molecule exists in bone tissues and that obif functions as a ligand. further investigation of the functional mechanisms of obif may shed light on a new signaling mechanism in osteoblast and chondrocyte differentiation.

CONCLUSIONS
we have isolated and functionally characterized a novel plasma membrane protein, obif. obif is highly expressed in early and late stage osteoblasts of developing mouse embryos, and its transcripts increase during osteoblastic differentiation in several skeletal cell lines. in preosteoblastic mc3t3-e <dig> cells, differentiation, particularly matrix mineralization, is stimulated when obif is overexpressed, and inhibited when obif is knocked down. furthermore, we showed that the extracellular domain of obif protein can promote mc3t3-e <dig> differentiation like the full-length form of obif, suggesting that obif functions in a ligand-like manner.
