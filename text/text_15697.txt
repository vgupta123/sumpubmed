BACKGROUND
huntington's disease  is an autosomal dominant neurological disorder caused when the cag expansions encode the polyglutamine  stretches at the n-terminus of the huntingtin  protein  <cit> . hd is a devastating disorder that results in motor dysfunction, psychiatric disturbances and cognitive impairment. typically, hd patients progress to their death  <dig> to  <dig> years after the onset of symptoms at mid-life. however, the age of onset is highly correlated to the size of polyq, while cag repeats below  <dig> are considered unaffected. key neuropathological features can be found in the striatal region, specifically the medial spiny neurons where neurodegeneration can also be observed throughout the central nervous system. unique hd pathology is characterized by the accumulation of oligomeric mutant htt, the formation of intranuclear inclusions , neuropil aggregates and progressive neuronal death.

although htt plays a crucial role in early embryogenesis  <cit> , the functions of htt remain largely unknown. the role of htt in neural development is intriguing since htt is widely expressed in the body with its highest levels of expression in the brain and testis, while the primary site of damages in hd are found in the brain  <cit> . in order to clarify the mechanism of neural specific degeneration and the impact of cell types on hd pathogenesis, pluripotent stem cells that are capable of differentiating into multiple cell lineages are a unique model for studying cell and tissue specific pathogenesis of hd.

human hd-es  cell lines have been generated using human embryos  <cit>  or by induced pluripotency using hd patients skin cells  <cit> . these hhd-es cell lines are unique resources for studying hd; however, follow up study has been limited. although hhd-es cells carry mutant htt, the pathological sequence is expected to follow a similar time-course in hd patients, typically developing during mid-life. so far, no good hd cell model has yet been reported that develops hallmark hd cellular pathological features paralleling neural development. the latest development of transgenic hd monkeys suggests that n-terminal fragments of htt and expanded polyq can accelerate the onset of hd in higher primates with distinctive neuropathological and cognitive behavioral characteristics  <cit> . the purpose of the study is to develop a pluripotent stem cell model for studying the mechanism of hd and the impact of developmental events on hd pathogenesis, which could also be used as a platform for drug discovery research and the development of new treatments. because of the development of robust hd features in transgenic hd monkeys, we expect a pluripotent primate stem cell line with small htt fragments and expanded polyq may lead to the development of hallmark hd cellular pathology that parallels neural development.

although there is an immediate need for a pluripotent stem cell model that develops hd cellular phenotypes that parallel neural differentiation for studying hd pathogenesis, the use of nuclear transplantation derived stem cells has been limited by low efficiency  <cit> . while induced pluripotency is a promising method, only one study on induced pluripotent thesus macaque stem cells has been reported, which forced us to consider an alternative strategy to derive pluripotent hd monkey stem cells  <cit> . we have established a pluripotent hd monkey hybrid stem cell line, tres <dig>  that replicates the impact of mutant htt during the course of in vitro neuronal development. tres <dig> was created by using a tetraploid embryo generated by the fusion of a transgenic hd monkey skin fibroblast with a wild-type non-transgenic -monkey oocyte. using this tres <dig>  we have demonstrated the progressive development of hd hallmark cellular features that parallel neuronal development in vitro in higher primate pluripotent stem cells for the first time.

RESULTS
characterization of hd monkey skin fibroblast
skin cells were isolated from a miscarried male transgenic hd monkey  at four months of gestation. rhd was confirmed transgenic with mutant htt and gfp gene by pcr . a total of  <dig> cag repeats were confirmed in the transgenic mutant htt gene, which was identical to the parent skin fibroblast.

the expression of mutant htt was confirmed by western blot and immunohistochemistry with mem <dig>  a monoclonal antibody whose reaction with human htt is enhanced by polyq expansion  <cit> . western blotting of brain and peripheral tissues demonstrated the presence of oligomeric htt at high molecular weight  in the upper portion of a gradient polyacrylamide gel . oligomeric mutant htt was presented in the peripheral tissues  and brain  of rhd but not in wt-monkeys. the extent of expression and aggregation levels of mutant htt was observed among peripheral tissues , while only some skin cells developed htt aggregates and nis .

generation of hd monkey tetraploid embryo and derivation of a hybrid cell line
the primary cultured skin cells of rhd were used to derive tetraploid embryos by fusion with mature wt-monkey oocytes. the first polar body  was removed through a pre-cut zona-pellucida  and a skin cell was placed under the zp  followed by electrofusion  to create a hybrid embryo. the reconstructed hybrid embryos were chemically activated and cultured until blastocyst stage for the derivation of es cells .

two out of four reconstructed hd monkey hybrid embryos were developed to blastocyst. the hybrid blastocysts  were placed onto mouse fetal fibroblast  feeder cells and allowed to form an outgrowth . at  <dig> to  <dig> days, one of the blastocysts developed an outgrowth with es cell like morphology  . an es cell like region was mechanically dissected and cultured. the resultant hd monkey hybrid cell line, named tres <dig>  retains monkey es cell morphology  and is pluripotent. cytogenetic analysis confirmed that tres <dig> is a tetraploid hybrid cell line with three "x" chromosomes and one "y" chromosome , which suggested that a set of "xy" chromosome was derived from skin cell of rhd while a set of "xx" chromosome was derived from the monkey oocyte.

inheritance of mutant htt and gfp genes in tres <dig> was confirmed by pcr analysis while these transgenes can only be derived from rhd but not from the wt-monkey oocyte.

genetic identity analysis
microsatellite analysis and comparison of its mitochondrial sequence were used to determine the genetic identity of tres <dig>  in all genotyping assays, all alleles presented in hd monkey skin cells and the lymphocytes of oocyte donor were also presented in tres <dig> . this suggested that tres <dig> is a tetraploid and contain the nuclear genetic material of both the rhd and oocyte donor, thus tres <dig> is a true hybrid cell line.

genotypes for  <dig> loci were assayed on genomic dna of hd monkey skin cells, lymphocyte of monkey oocyte donor and tres <dig>  all alleles present in the skin fibroblasts and oocyte donor are presented in tres <dig>  indicating tres <dig> is a hybrid of hd monkey skin cell and monkey oocyte.

for dna comparisons of the mitochondrial sequence,  <dig> rhesus macaque specific single nucleotide polymorphisms  were analyzed. in all  <dig> cases the tres <dig> matched the oocyte donor but not the rhd skin cells , conclusively showing that the mitochondria present within the hybrid line were inherited from the female monkey who donated the oocyte that created the hybrid embryo that was used for the derivation of tres <dig>  this result is consistent with a prior study in somatic cell nuclear transplantation  that mitochondria inheritance of reconstructed embryos is primarily derived from recipient oocytes instead of the donor cell nuclei  <cit> .

mitochondrial sequence comparisons of hd monkey skin cells, lymphocyte of monkey oocyte donor and tres <dig>  the representative example is position 371- <dig> of macaca mulatta ncbi reference sequence nc_ <dig>  highlighted regions clearly show mitochondrial inheritance of tres <dig>  is obtained from the monkey oocyte.

stem cell properties and pluripotency
to determine the stem cell properties of tres <dig>  immunostaining of common monkey es cell markers was used. tres <dig> expressed alkaline phosphatase , oct <dig>  and stem cell specific surface antigens .

to determine the pluripotency of tres <dig>  in vitro differentiation to neural cells was performed. a step-wise differentiation protocol was used in this study while immunostaining was performed at different stages to confirm successful differentiation  <cit> . the expression of nestin was observed at n <dig> stage when selective expansion of neural progenitor cells  occurred . in general, one week induction for neuronal maturation was suggested at n <dig> stage . in order to mimic mature neurons in adult brains that are primarily maintained at a post-mitotic stage, we have extended n <dig> culture to four weeks  to determine if extended culture impacted the mutant htt associated phenotype. glial fibrillary acidic protein , a glial cell marker and neural specific Î²iii tubulin, was detected by immunostaining at both n3-1w and n3-4w stages , which suggested tres <dig> was capable of differentiating to mature neuronal cell types. although the expression of mutant htt does not seem to affect neural differentiation of tres <dig>  potential effects of mutant htt on differentiation toward specific neuronal or peripheral cell types cannot be excluded and further investigation is necessary. furthermore, the expression of gfp was observed at all stages .

expression of mutant htt in tres <dig> derived neuronal differentiation
to determine if the expression of mutant htt and the development of hd specific cellular pathology are related to the course of neural development, the expression patterns of mutant htt, the accumulation of mutant htt aggregate, the presence of oligomeric mutant htt and the formation of nis were examined by quantitative real time pcr , western blot, immunostaining and cell count at various stages during in vitro development.

q-pcr analysis revealed similar expression levels of mutant htt in undifferentiated tres <dig> and yres <dig>  at different differentiation stages . a significant increase in the expression of mutant htt was observed in tres <dig> at n <dig>  n3-1w and n3-4w when compared to undifferentiated tres <dig> and yres <dig> at respected stages . however, no difference was observed in tres <dig> at n <dig>  n3-1w and n3-4w . the same batch of cell samples was then used for western blot analysis. oligomeric mutant htt was revealed in tres <dig> at n <dig>  n3-1w and n3-4w stages but not in undifferentiated tres <dig> and yres <dig> at any stages . furthermore, the extent of oligomeric mutant htt was gradually enhanced as tres <dig> progressed during in vitro neuronal differentiation . while the accumulation of oligomeric mutant htt increased in differentiating tres <dig>  oligomeric mutant htt was substantially increased in n3-4w compared to n3-1w . this result suggests the possible impact of neural development on hd pathogenesis.

in order to determine the impact of mutant htt and the extent of cellular pathology during the course of neural development, undifferentiated tres <dig>  tres <dig> at n <dig>  n3-1w and n3-4w were immunostained with mem <dig>  cells developing mutant htt aggregates and containing nis were identified and counted. while the expression of mutant htt was not detected in undifferentiated tres <dig> by immunostaining, the number of mem48+ cells was significantly higher in n3-4w  > n3-1wk  > n <dig>  . the mem48+ cells were then grouped as cells that form nuclear aggregate, cells with nuclear aggregate and contained one-to-five, six-to- <dig>  and more than  <dig> nis . the number of tres <dig> with nuclear aggregate and developing one to five pieces of nis was significantly increased in n3-4w compared to n3-1w and n <dig>  this finding was consistent with the q-pcr and western blot analysis, which suggested the expression of mutant htt was not different between n <dig>  n3-1w and n3-4w, but the accumulation of oligomeric mutant htt increased as tres <dig> continued neuronal differentiation in vitro and extended culture.

in vivo differentiation of tres <dig> in the striatum of scid mice
to determine the pluripotency of tres <dig> in vivo, undifferentiated tres <dig> and tres <dig> at the n <dig> stage  were implanted into the striatum of the contralateral hemisphere of severely compromised immune deficient  mice. at four-to- <dig> weeks post-implantation, animals were euthanized and their brains were recovered for morphological analysis  and an immunohistochemistry study using different antibodies to determine neural differentiation  and the expression of mutant htt .

a histological study showed that only the undifferentiated tres <dig> implanted hemisphere developed teratoma, which contained different tissue types, including gut-like epithelium , muscle  and neural tissues  . no teratoma was observed at the contralateral hemisphere where npcs were implanted . on the other hand, an immunohistochemical study revealed the expression of neuronal markers including nestin, gfap and microtubule-associated protein   in both hemispheres. consistent with histological analysis, the hemisphere that was implanted with undifferentiated tres <dig> developed teratoma with heterogenous expression of neuronal markers suggesting non-neuronal tissues was developed . in contrast, the hemisphere implanted with tres <dig> derived npcs homogenously expressed neuronal markers and was co-labeled with gfp that was only expressed in tres <dig> and the derivative cells . similar results were observed in all scid mice implanted with both cell types. although nis were not observed, a nuclear aggregate was observed in both hemispheres .

discussion
in this study, we showed that tres <dig>  a hybrid cell line of huntington monkey skin fibroblast and monkey oocyte, is pluripotent and develops robust hd cellular features as it progresses during neural development in vitro. the accumulation of mutant htt aggregates and the formation of nis were significantly enhanced and increased at later stages of neural development while a relatively lower expression of mutant htt was detected in undifferentiated tres <dig> with no detectable accumulation of mutant htt aggregates and nis. our finding is consistent with hd pathogenesis where neuronal tissues are the primary targets and post-mitotic neural cells accumulate oligomeric mutant htt as disease progresses, whereas peripheral cell and tissue types are expected to have minimal impact.

a pluripotent cell line with an inherited genetic disorder is one of the best models for understanding the underlying mechanism of developmental events in disease progression  <cit> . multipotent differentiation capabilities of pluripotent cells are particularly intriguing for the study of neurodegenerative diseases such as hd, because pathological events specifically target neuronal cell types where peripheral tissues rarely develop comparable cellular pathology  <cit>  tres <dig> is capable of differentiating into neuronal cell types that mimic early hd developmental events. unlike other hd cell models, either by transient or stable expression of mutant htt in somatic cells  or a neuronal cell line   <cit> , a pluripotent cell line is capable of replicating the influence of developmental events and mutant htt on hd pathogenesis that no other cell model can achieve. although hd mouse es cells  <cit>  and hhd-es cells have been established  <cit> , most of these cell lines do not develop robust hd cellular features that parallel neural differentiation, and detailed characterization of hd pathogenic features in hhd-es cells has not been reported. therefore, a pluripotent cell line such as tres <dig>  which develops key hd cellular phenotypes, is a unique cell model for studying hd and understanding fundamental differences between neuronal and peripheral cells/tissues in hd pathogenesis. thus unique cell/tissue specific components and events that lead to differential susceptibility of hd cellular pathogenesis can be identified. one of the major concerns of deriving pluripotent stem cells such as tres <dig> by tetrapolid technique is its potential instability due to the nature of tetraploidy. thus the development of diploid hd stem cell lines from diploid embryos or by mean of nuclear transplantation and ips technology is important for future applications such as cell therapy.

the impact of developmental events on the progression of hd was further suggested by the gradual increase of the aggregate form of mutant htt as neural differentiation progresses while the expression levels of mutant htt remains. the continued accumulation of mutant htt aggregate and the increase of cells with intranuclear inclusions in extended neuronal culture further suggest the potential impact on post-mitotic neural cells. while this study is the first step in characterizing hd monkey pluripotent stem cells, future development of a differentiation protocol toward specific neuronal cell types and peripheral cell types will facilitate the investigation of mutant htt cell type specific pathogenesis.

due to ethical reasons, the development of pluripotent human hybrid cell lines is not an option. recent success in developing ips cells using skin cells of human patients  <cit> and monkeys  <cit>  has opened a new door for investigating the potential of personal stem cells. the present study evolved from our latest success in developing a transgenic hd monkey model. while efforts in developing alternative methods for deriving pluripotent stem cell lines from hd monkeys continue, tres <dig> provides a unique model for investigating the mechanism of hd pathogenesis and the role of neural developmental events. furthermore, a pluripotent cell line such as tres <dig>  which develop hallmark hd features paralleling neural development, is a useful tool for accurate interpretation of therapeutic efficacy of new molecules and compounds. so far, there is no other cell model that replicates key hd cell pathology in parallel with the progression of neural development in vitro.

one possible explanation for the robust hd cellular phenotypes in tres <dig> could be due to the over-expression of small htt fragments with expanded polyq. hd monkeys that carried similar htt mutants developed hd clinical features early in life  <cit> , which is consistent with our findings in tres <dig>  thus stem cell lines derived from hhd patients by either traditional methods using pgd diagnosed embryos or ips may not develop robust hd phenotypes comparable to tres <dig> even with expanded polyq because of the full-length htt. studies in hd mouse models further support our speculation that full length htt is less toxic compared to small htt fragments  <cit> . thus hd patients' derived stem cell lines may not be able to develop hallmark cellular features without extended culture time to allow the accumulation of cellular defects.

while a hybrid cell line is not a perfect model, we have now demonstrated that a pluripotent primate stem cells could replicate some of the key pathological features of hd suggesting the continue effort in developing a personal stem cell from hd patients by mean of induced pluripotency or other methods is of great value as a model for studying hd or as a cell source for therapy. however, the progression of hd phenotypes in such cell lines may vary because of the constitution of the mutant htt gene and human cell lines with full length htt and extended cag repeat may require additional time to develop pathological features of hd.

CONCLUSIONS
a pluripotent tetraploid huntington's monkey stem cell line  was derived by the fusion of transgenic hd monkey skin cell and monkey oocyte. tres <dig> is the first primate stem cells that develop key hd cellular features  paralleling in vitro neural development. because of the robust development of hd phenotypes, tres <dig> could be a useful tool for studying the developmental impact hd and as a platform for drug discovery research.
