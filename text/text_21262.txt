BACKGROUND
taxonomically, the orthoretrovirinae  and spumaretrovirinae
 <dig>  make up the two subfamilies of retroviridae. they share many similarities, including overall genome structures with gag, pol and env genes encoding proteins for replication and life cycles involving reverse transcription and integration into the chromosomes of infected cells. however, there are also a number of differences distinguishing these viral subfamilies, including finer details of genome organisation, the absence of a gag-pol fusion protein in spumaviruses and the timing of reverse transcription  <cit> .

gag is the major structural protein of both ortho and foamy viruses and is responsible for many of the differences and similarities between the viral subfamilies. ortho and foamy viral gags are required for particle assembly, budding from the cell, reverse transcription and delivery of the viral nucleic acid into the newly infected cell. however, there are a number of striking differences including how the gag precursor is targeted to the cell membrane, the absence of a major homology region and cys-his box in foamy viruses and very different patterns of processing during viral maturation  <cit> . in all ortho viruses, gag is proteolytically cleaved to form distinct, well-studied proteins, matrix , capsid  and nucleocapsid , found in mature virions, whilst in spumaviruses gag processing to remove a c-terminal peptide occurs only in a fraction of the gag molecules  <cit> .

structural information regarding foamy virus gag has been limited to the crystal structure of the n-terminal env binding region of prototypic foamy virus  gag  that although maintaining some of the function of orthoretrivial ma shared no structural similarity  <cit> . however, more recently the solution nmr structure of the pfv gag central ca domains has shed new light on the relationship between ortho and spumaviruses. it reveals that the ca structures of both viral subfamilies share a common protein fold, implying that their gag proteins may be evolutionarily related  <cit> .

however, an intriguing aspect of this relationship was an ambiguity in the degree of relatedness between the ca domains of the gag proteins, with the spumaretroviral ca domains, ntdcen and ctdcen, appearing almost equally similar to either the amino-  or carboxy-terminal  domains of the orthoretroviruses. with small domains that share a high degree of background similarity, particularly those composed entirely of α-helices, it is very difficult to evaluate the significance of their structural relationships as chance combinations of a few helices can give rise to an apparently convincing overlaps with a low rmsd.

in this paper, we now investigate and clarify the nature of the relationship between these capsid domains and discuss its evolutionary implications. our work provides a demonstration of a general approach to the resolution of difficult comparison problems in which the proteins share a high intrinsic level of similarity.

RESULTS
full-length comparison
to investigate the structural relationship between the capsid structure of the ortho viruses , and the new structure of the foamy virus capsid  <cit>  , the foamy virus structure was compared to one of the few full double domain ortho virus structures, the hiv capsid with pdb code: 3nte, using the flexible superposition program sap  <cit> . even though this program has a tolerant approach to relative domain shifts, the comparison produced a high rmsd value of 14Å over the  <dig> best superposed positions. the amino  terminal domain positions roughly corresponded but shifts in the relative orientation of the carboxy  terminal domain resulted in large deviations between equivalent helices. the superposed structures are shown in fig. 1
a and the domain divergence can be seen clearly as a jump in the cumulative rmsd plot .

dali searches
although this initial superposition  did not appear encouraging, the foamy virus structure was scanned across the protein databank , using the dali program  <cit>  to search for any similarities.

full chain scan
a scan of the full-length foamy structure using the dali server <dig> over the 90% non-redundant protein structure databank identified a wide selection of retroviral capsid structures. in the ranked list of structure hits, capsids were identified from position  <dig> to position  <dig>  the top hits are shown in fig. <dig> . many capsids are found in the top  <dig> hits and although the top scoring hit is not obviously a capsid protein, it is thought to have originated from the ty3/gypsy retrotransposon family gag gene  <cit> . however, almost all of these are partial hits, covering little more than half the query structure. the structural alignment of the top two hits is shown in fig.  <dig> coloured to emphasise the matched regions.

the result of the dali search indicated that the foamy virus structure shares some similarity with the capsid structure of the ortho-viruses. however, the matches consist only of a small number of helices and appears barely more convincing than other matches to proteins that seem very unlikely to have any meaningful connection to a viral capsid. the preponderance of capsid matches throughout the list of hits might seem to add some support to the relationship but may simply be a reflection of the number of capsid structures in the structure databank.

adding confusion to the ortho/foamy relationship is the additional observation that the distribution of matches to the ortho-virus structures between the amino  and carboxy  terminal domains are mixed. for example; taking the top  <dig> matches, the n-terminal domain of the foamy structure aligns with  <dig> c-terminal domains and  <dig> n-terminal domains of the ortho virsuses and the best match with the corresponding foamy c-terminal domain aligns with an ortho n-terminal domain.

domain scans
to clarify the domain match specificity, the two domains of the foamy virus  were scanned separately using the dali program. the individual domains were much more specific at matching known capsid structures <dig>  both in the full pdb and pdb- <dig> collections as can be seen from the plots in fig.  <dig> 
fig.  <dig> pdb capsid structure matches. the number of capsid structures identified by the dali program in  the full pdb and  the 90% non-redundant pdb  is shown for queries using the full foamy capsid structure , the carboxy terminal domain  and the amino terminal domain . the number of capsid hits  is plotted against the order of all hits ranked by z-score down to a value of  <dig>  a curve approaching the top left corner indicates greater specificity and the extent of a curve to the right indicates the total number of hits




the results of these scans strengthened the identification of the relationship to the ortho capsids and supported the swapped specificity for the n-terminal match of the foamy structure with the c-terminal match of the ortho virus and vica versa, with all top  <dig> hits of each domain matching their opposed counterpart. the structure-based sequence alignments of each domain based on this equivalence are shown in fig.  <dig> 
fig.  <dig> top domain similarity alignments. the sequence alignments are shown for the top  <dig> capsid domain matches found by the dali program using the foamy virus capsid n and c domains separately as a query over the full pdb. the sequence of the n-terminal domain  is shown at the top of the first alignment block and the sequences of the c-terminal domain  at the top of the second block. the sequences of the ortho-virsuses aligned below these all come from the “swapped” relationship of c and n terminal domains, respectively. these alignments, which are determined by structure not sequence, exhibit no specific similarity beyond what would be expected from aligning similar secondary structures from similar sized domains. . the location of alpha helices is marked by the letter ‘a’, taken from the pdb entries of their adjacent proteins. a selection of other foamy virus sequences are aligned above the foamy virus sequence of known structure  which, from the top, are from: simian , squirrel-monkey, cat, simian  and horse. 




although domain transposition is not impossible in viral genomes, it is sufficiently unexpected to warrant deeper investigation, especially as it is hard to imagine how an ancestral capsid protein could tolerate such a large rearrangement and still pack to form a competent shell. we therefore undertook a more thorougher evaluation using alternative methods to assess the statistical significance of these structural similarities.

structural alignment significance
reversed-structure searches
for each comparison, the dali program calculates an empirical z-score, combining an estimation of significance with protein length normalisation. the program reports all matches over z= <dig>  however, when the proteins are small and especially when the structures being compared are both predominantly alpha-helical in nature, then matches over this cutoff include many functionally unrelated hits where the similarity has arisen through the fortuitous alignment of a few helices.

therefore, to calculate a stricter cutoff on score, we created a decoy probe by reversing the alpha-carbon backbone then reconstructing the full atomic structure, using a simple algorithm to regenerate a full backbone4). figure  <dig> plots the ranked dali z-scores for the separate  foamy domains. as would be expected, the larger c-terminal domain has hits with a higher significance than the smaller n-terminal domain: the former covers the range z= <dig>  to z= <dig> over the true hits  whereas the latter tracks a similar profile running one z-value unit lower . plotting the z-scores against the log of their rank produces almost linear traces for the hits from the pdb- <dig>  making it easy to compare n-domain  with c-domain   in fig.  <dig> 
fig.  <dig> 
dali scores with decoys. the dali
z-scores  are plotted against the log  <dig> of their ranked position in the list of hits  with the amino-terminal domain  as t=red, f=cyan dots and the carboxy-terminal domain  as t=magenta and f=green dots, where t is a true capsid hit and f is a false hit to a non-capsid protein. four sets of decoys are compared to these, consisting of the reversed foamy capsid domains in black and the reversed hiv capsid domains in dark-blue . the dali score for each set of hits has been slightly displaced to prevent coincident dots from being obscured. . a full pbd. b pdb-90




the equivalent scans with the reversed domain structures, using both the foamy and ortho  structures  also found hits with high z-scores . when compared with the native domains , these decoys had a profile that tracked mostly above the n-terminal native domain but below the c-terminal domain. however, with the latter domain, this was only distinct in the hits to the full pdb whereas with the pdb- <dig>  the native domain was only clearly better over the top  <dig> matches, half of which were to non-capsid structures.

the results with the simple reversed decoy using dali suggested that the match of the foamy virus domains to the ortho virus capsid n-terminal domain may be due to chance and that the match to the c-terminal domain looks meaningful if based on the hits to the full pdb but may be only marginal based on the pdb- <dig> hits.

however, both the n and c terminal domains pocess a degree of internal symmetry which gives rise to a partial match with their reversed ’doppleganger’ decoys. the n-terminal domain superposed on its decoy had an rmsd of  <dig> / <dig>  and  <dig> / <dig> for the c-terminal domain . the higher symmetry of the smaller domain may be sufficient to explain its poor level of specificity seen in fig.  <dig> and to try and resolve this ambiguity, a more diverse set of decoys was generated based on cyclic permutation and segment swapping combined with chain reversal  <cit> .

customised decoy comparisons
to improve the statistical analysis of the foamy/ortho capsid similarity, we employed a method based on the generation of a population of customised ‘decoy’ models to provide a background distribution of unrelated protein scores  <cit> . this method retains the advantage of the simple reversed structures where every comparison that constitutes the random pool is between two models of the same size and secondary structure composition as the pair of native structures being compared. for this study we collected  <dig> capsid n-terminal domains and  <dig> c-terminal domains, each of which were compared with the foamy n-terminal domain and the foamy c-terminal domain. .

for each amino  and carboxy  domain pair between an ortho virus structure and the foamy virus capsid structure, a z-score is calculated based on the a-value  derived from the comparison rmsd and length, relative to the pool of background decoy comparisons. the ortho virus identity is indicated by the code to the left, full details of which can be found in the “methods” section. the top  <dig> z-scores are high-lighted in bold, only three of which support a swapped domain match




for each domain pair to be compared, decoys were created using cyclic permutation and segment swapping with chain reversal to generate a family of customised decoys for each comparison  <cit> . all pairs of forward/reversed decoys were then compared, with each pair being drawn from a pool of models generated from the two native structures. this ensures that the native domains  are always evaluated against a decoy pair with the same length combination. . all the decoy comparisons, of which there are typically 150– <dig> for each comparison, can then be compared to the native pair on a plot of rmsd against the number of matched residues . an example is shown in fig.  <dig> for the comparison of the hiv <dig> structure  and 1a <dig> ) domains against the foamy virus gag domains.

statistical analysis of the decoy comparisons
the quality of the comparisons in fig. 8
c can be quantified as a combination of their rmsd  and the number of matched  positions . however, as explained in the “methods” section, for statistical analysis, it is easier to combine this pair of numbers as a single number, called the a-value , which is the scaling factor that causes a theoretical curve to pass through the point .

when expressed by a single a-value all the data points in a comparison, such as fig. 8
c, can be plotted as a frequency histogram and examined to see if they approximate a normal distribution. the distributions were found to be a good fit to unskewed gaussians and so were treated as normal distributions . the frequency data from the comparison of the orthon domain from hiv <dig> and the foamyc domain  is shown in fig. 9
a along with a normal distribution that has the same mean  and standard deviation  as the data. on this plot, the value of a  for the comparison of the native pair of domains is also plotted  and from its position, a z-score can be calculated.

in this way, the significance of all combinations of the native ortho and foamy domain superpositions were calculated, using the background distribution of ‘customised’ decoy comparisons based on each individual native pair. the resulting z-scores  are collected in table  <dig>  the degree of similarity between the domains ranged from less than  <dig> σ to over  <dig> σ, with the latter  result being obtained for both a swapped  and forward  combination. however, of the top  <dig> scores, only three now came from swapped pairings.

asymmetry statistics:
to quantify the degree of bias for domains of like-type  to be more similar than those of mixed-type , the observed ranking of like and mixed pairs, based on their z-value , was compared to that expected by chance. the positions of all pairs in the list were shuffled a million times and the asymmetry of each arrangement was quantified as the number of like-pairs in the top half and also by their second moment: √∑ri2/n, where r is the rank of the like-pair i in a list of n pairs. the chance of obtaining a distribution with more like-pairs being ranked higher can be caluclated by summing the area of the tail of each empirical distribution that lies beyond the observed value. however, these values were calculated over all pairs and neglects the principle that emphasis should be given to the more significant similarities. rather than rely on a single significance cutoff  or an arbitrary cutoff , we calculated statistics for all such cutoffs .
fig.  <dig> asymmetry statistics for like/mixed domain pairs. given the ranked list of domain pairings, the chance for more domain pairs of like-type to be found higher than the observed order was evaluated from empirical distributions measured by two statistics: the second moment of the rank value  and the number of like-type pairs in the top half . these statistics were calculated for all subsets from the  <dig> top pairs up to the full set of comparisons  and for each, the chance of a better score is plotted as the log  <dig> of the probability . the horizontal lines mark the  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  levels. the line at the  <dig>  level is coloured by the z-score for each pair as: green = over  <dig> and cyan = over  <dig> sigma. part  shows the probabilities calculated from the full set of  <dig> carboxy and  <dig> amino domains and part  shows the same values calculated on a more balanced set of  <dig> non-redundant carboxy domains and their matching amino domains




the majority of values in fig. 10
a lie below the  <dig>  probability level for the larger sample sizes, with those for the top-half bias statistic  being more significant than the moment-based statistic . while confirming the visual trend towards a bias of higher scoring like-type domain similarities, the analysis summarised in fig. 10
a is complicated by having unequal numbers of amino and carboxy domain comparisons and also by including some closely related structures. to produce a more balanced data-set, one of each pair of the two most similar carboxy domain structures was discarded leaving five structures and for each of these, their matching amino terminal domain was also retained, leaving: blv- <dig>  hiv- <dig>  hml <dig>  htlv- <dig> and rsv. despite having a smaller set of comparisons , the results for this reduced set indicated an equally clear bias towards towards a preferred like-domain equivalance, especially as measured by their occurrence in the upper half of the ranked list, with several having a probability below the  <dig>  level and a few below the  <dig>  level .

t-test statistic:
an alternative to the above analysis, which still remains marginally significant, is to pool the raw comparison data for all the domain comparisons and their background distributions giving now not just a single value compared to a distribution but two distributions . for these data, a significance was calculated using student’s t-test, the values of which are given in table  <dig>

for each combination of domains between the ortho and foamy viruses, the probability is given that the two means from each distribution  were sampled from the same distribution. . all domain pairings are extremely significant. an f-test was used to test if the standard deviations  of each sample were distinct and if not, the a t-test was made on the assumption of equal standard deviations




from these results, it can be seen that all the four possible pairings are highly significant with probabilities ranging from 10− <dig> to over 10− <dig>  it is also clear that the two swapped pairings  have higher probabilities than the forward pairings . combining the probabilities  as: Δ
p= log10−l
o
g
 <dig>  gives a value of  <dig>   which means that the swapped pairing is almost  <dig> orders of magnitude less likely than the forward pairing. calculating the same statistic on the reduced 5n+5c domain data set gave a similar result but with a difference reduced 1000-fold to  <dig> orders of magnitude.

the unexpected swapped pairing, which was indicated originally by the dali results, now seems less likely. the preferred, and biologically more reasonable, result is that the ortho virus domain are related to the foamy virus domains as a result of genetic divergence from a common, double domain ancestor.

internal duplication
the transposed pairings of n/c and c/n  domains still retain a high structural significance and this suggests that the two domains are derived from a common ancestral structure, probably as the result of a prior gene-duplication event that has been retained more clearly in the less embellished foamy virus structures. comparing the two foamy domains gives a z-score of  <dig>  sigma which, although of marginal significance, supports this model. .

such a relationship between the foamy domains implies an equivalent relationship in the ortho viruses and a similar comparison in structures of their n and c domains finds matches with z-scores ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  as with the comparison of the ortho and foamy structures, these can be pooled to allow a joint t-test to be applied. this gave a probability of 10− <dig> that the true n/c domain comparisons were drawn from the decoy distribution, adding strong support to the hypothesis of an ancient gene duplication occurring before the split of the ortho and foamy virus families. . supporting this relationship, earlier studies also suggested an internal duplication in the ortho virsuses but were based largely on very distant sequence similarity  <cit> .

this test was applied only to the comparison of domains between viruses with known structures for both domains, however, it is not unreasonable to compare amino and carboxy domains across all viruses. the longer loops in the ortho virus domains gives greater scope of structural variation and a wide range of variation was seen ranging from rmsd values under  <dig> to over  <dig>  when normalised for length  and partial matches under  <dig> positions excluded, a distinct cluster remains between a= <dig> … <dig>   but still with a long tail to higher values. despite this tail, the t-test on the distributions is highly significant at  <dig> ×10− <dig>

fold-space representation
to summarise the structural relationships among the ortho and foamy domains, the matrix of pairwise comparisons was projected into a three-dimensional fold-space. . this produces a best visual representation of the rmsd values between domains.

as can be seen from fig.  <dig>  the n and c domains of the ortho viruses form distinct clusters with the foamy c domain lying closer to the ortho c-domain cluster. the foamy n-domain, however, maintains a fairly equal distance from both ortho domain clusters but lies closer to its c-terminal partner.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
structure comparison
pairwise significance
the comparison of small domains that are largely composed of α-helices presents a challenging problem in how to interpret the significance of the rmsd values. as the individual helical secondary structure elements  constitute a sizeable fraction of the domain, it takes only the chance alignment of a few helices to result in a low rmsd over a large proportion of the structure, giving an apparently meaingful result.

the use of the customised decoy-model sets, as illustrated here, attempts to avoid this problem by recreating a large number of possible folds that were generated using the same  sses. moreover, to avoid any chance recreation of native fragments, each comparison always involved the comparison of a native  chain direction with a reversed chain. using these models, a background distribution of decoy/decoy comparisons allowed us to calculate z-scores for each native/native comparison between the different gag proteins. this has the advantage that every comparison in the background distribution involved two models with the same length, residue packing density and secondary composition as the native pair. these values indicated a clearly significant relationship between the foamy and ortho ca structures.

direct or transposed domain order?
although the decoy model alignment strategy did confirm the relationship between the foamy and ortho ca structures, the z-scores did not point to a clear resolution of whether the domains should have a direct correspondence  or a transposed relationship  as significant individual matches were found across all pairings. testing for a bias towards more significant like-domain pairings  in the list of similarities ranked by z-score confirmed the visual bias towards a natural correspondence but only at a marginal level of significance . by contrast, the application of a t-test on the combined raw comparison data returned a very clear distinction between the direct and the transposed relationships, clearly favouring the more natural forward order.

however, although the “astronomic” probabilities calculated by the t-test seem very convincing, they must be viewed in the light of the much lower probabilities calculated from the asymmetry statistics. both calculations involve assumptions and are limited by the small number of known structures so neither can be taken as definitive. nevertheless it would seem likely that the “true” level of significance may lie somewhere between the two results and as both of these objective assessments point in the direction of the nn and cc domain order, there is no reason to adopt the more unexpected transposed domain order.

evolutionary implications
on the basis of these structural comparisons, and a variety of recently described functional assays  <cit> , we can conclude that the central region of the spumavirus gag gene encodes a polypeptide sequence related to that of the corresponding region of orthoretroviral, ca. it therefore seems reasonable to suppose that the last common ancestor of orthoretroviruses and spumaviruses possessed such a sequence. moreover this region appears to be made up from two related all helical subdomains suggesting a gene duplication event in a common precursor.

in our initial search employing foamy virus ca using the dali program, we made the observation that the strongest similarity of the foamy virus ca domains was actually with a cellular protein, arc . arc is required for neural synaptic growth and activity  and mis-regulation and/or deletion contributes to diseases of cognition  <cit> . arc has widespread and clear sequence homologues as far back as insects and probably deeper, giving it a very ancient origin somewhere close to the metazoan root  <cit>  and based on sequence homology arc is considered to be a relic of an ancient ty3/gypsy retrotransposon  <cit> , preserved as a ‘living fossil’ in metazoan genomes. given the structural relatedness of foamy virus ca and arc, this might suggest an equally ancient origin for foamy virus ca. as it is believed that the ty3/gypsy family of retrotransposons gave rise to retroviruses  <cit> , it will therefore be of considerable interest to determine whether the gag of ty elements also comprise ca proteins with a two-domain structure.

it is also noteworthy that ty <dig> gag is significantly smaller than that of the foamy and orthoretroviruses and although it contains ca related sequences there is no equivalent of either orthoretroviral ma or pfv gag-ntd, regions of gag necessary for membrane targeting, budding and extracellular release of virions. therefore, given the very different structures of ma  and gag-ntd  <cit> , this raises the possibility that the ma and gag-ntd domains of the orthoretroviruses and foamy viruses were co-opted by independent events that has resulted in the viruses employing different mechanisms to facilitate budding from the cell. notably, gag from gypsy, an errantivirus capable of extracellular replication  <cit>  and arc contain additional n-terminal domains. in gypsy-gag this domain is distantly sequence-related to orthoretroviral ma  <cit> . by contrast, in arc it contains a coiled coil region  <cit>  reminiscent of spumavirus gag-ntd  <cit>  further supporting the notion of a shared origin for arc and foamy virus gag that is distinguishable from an alternative acquisition pathway giving rise to gypsy and the orthoretroviruses.
