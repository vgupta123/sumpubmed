BACKGROUND
the bacterium acinetobacter baumannii is very tolerant to desiccation and has developed resistance against many of the antimicrobial agents in common use  <cit> . both these features render it ideally suited to survive in the hospital environment, and invest it with the power to cause important nosocomial outbreaks  <cit> . multidrug-resistant  a. baumannii infection is a worldwide health problem that has a negative impact on the morbidity and the mortality of the affected patients  <cit> . the epidemiological study of mdr a. baumannii outbreaks is essential if they are to be ended and their recurrence prevented. clonal analysis of the strains involved is a vital part of these studies  <cit> . this can be undertaken via genotyping techniques such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis   <cit> , multilocus sequence typing   <cit> , and multiple locus variable number tandem repeat sequence  analysis   <cit> . genotyping provides information concerning outbreaks; e.g., the genetic diversity of clones, their temporal and spatial distribution, their implication on endemic or epidemic events, the acquisition source of the bacteria, as well as the number of affected patients; that is basic for preventive and control measures to be implemented.

a previous study of a. baumannii isolates from spanish hospitals  <cit>  showed the predominance of international clone ii . two novel clones were also detected - st- <dig> and st- <dig> - as well as international clonal complex 1/st- <dig>  the minor clones detected included international clone iii , st- <dig> and st- <dig> 

the aim of the present work was to study the endemic and epidemic clones of a. baumannii in a not previously studied single hospital over a long period, and to compare them, using the aforementioned genotyping methods, with other nosocomial clones circulating in spain.

RESULTS
pfge analysis
pfge analysis of the  <dig> a. baumannii-calcoaceticus complex isolates returned  <dig> different pfge types. among these,  <dig> pfge types  were considered sporadic given their wide genetic disparity and small number of isolates . fifteen pfge types, however, covering  <dig> a. baumannii isolates, were considered endemic or epidemic, and selected for further study.

figure  <dig> shows the pfge genetic similarity dendogram. the pfge types were numbered ee <dig> to ee <dig>  the hunter-gaston diversity index   <cit>  calculated for the pfge technique with respect to the further-examined  <dig> isolates was  <dig>  . the genetic similarity range for their  <dig> pfge types was  <dig>  – 100%. five clusters  were observed; their genetic similarity values were ee1-ee <dig> , ee9-ab <dig> , ee10-ee10* , ee11-ab <dig> , and ee12-ee <dig> . figure  <dig> shows the temporal and spatial distribution of the endemic/epidemic clones.figure  <dig>

acinetobacter baumannii epidemic sequence types
for each gene, the number of alleles and polymorphic sites  were: cpn <dig>  <dig> , fusa  <dig> , glta  <dig> , pyrg  <dig> , reca  <dig> , rplb  <dig> , and rpob  <dig> . four different sts were detected: st- <dig>  st- <dig>  st- <dig> and st- <dig>  the hgdi for the mlst technique was  <dig>  .

international clone ii  involved clusters ee1-ee <dig> and ee <dig> , and included 60% of the studied pfge types. international clone iii  involved cluster ee12-ee <dig> and  <dig> % of the pfge types. st- <dig> and st- <dig> were detected in clusters ee <dig> and ee <dig> respectively, both representing  <dig> % of the pfge types.

acinetobacter baumannii epidemic mlva-8orsay types
seventeen mlva-8orsay allelic profiles were detected among the  <dig> studied pfge types since the pairs ee4-ee4* and ee10-ee10* had different allelic profiles despite sharing the same pfge type. the hgdi for the technique, taking into account all the vntr loci examined, was  <dig> . the individual hgdi scores for these markers ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . microsatellites were more diverse  than minisatellites . assuming a 40% cut-off for mlva-8orsay genetic similarity , four mlva complexes were identified: a, b, c, and d. figure  <dig> and table  <dig> show the mlva-8orsay data. figure  <dig> shows the minimum spanning tree for mlva-8orsay clustering.figure  <dig>

amplification products were obtained for all vntr markers except for abaum_ <dig> in ee <dig> and ee <dig>  a previously described, non-conserved 77–80 bp repeat unit in the abaum_ <dig> locus  <cit>  was detected in all pfge types, instead of the 26 bp repeat unit described by pourcel  <cit> .

susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, β-lactamase genes, and insertion sequences
the antimicrobial susceptibility rates recorded were 100% for colistin,  <dig> % for sulbactam,  <dig> % for imipenem,  <dig> % for meropenem,  <dig> % for amikacin,  <dig> % for minocycline,  <dig> % for doxycycline, and  <dig> % for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. all isolates showed resistance to mezlocillin, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, gentamicin, tobramycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin.

all  <dig> pfge types had an extensively drug-resistant  phenotype involving non-susceptibility to ≥ <dig> agent in all but ≤ <dig> antimicrobial categories  <cit> . resistance to imipenem  was detected in five of the pfge types: ee <dig>  ee <dig>  ee <dig>  ee <dig>  and ee <dig> 

carbapenem hydrolyzing oxacillinase  genes and metallobetalactamase  genes were sought in the five pfge types resistant to imipenem, as well as in ab <dig> and ab <dig> . ee <dig>  ee <dig>  ee <dig> and ab <dig> carried the cho gene blaoxa-58-like, with isaba <dig> and isaba <dig> upstream and downstream respectively. ee <dig>  ee <dig>  and ab <dig> carried the blaoxa-40-like gene. no mbl genes were amplified. acinetobacter-derived cephalosporinase  and oxa- <dig> genes were also sought among the pfge types with st- <dig> or st- <dig>  and compared to those of ab <dig> and ab <dig> . pairs ee11-ab <dig> and ee9-ab <dig> had the same pattern of adc, oxa- <dig> and chos genes and associated insertion sequences  .table  <dig>

discussion
this study includes all a. baumanni-calcoaceticus complex isolates collected in a hospital during a twelve-year period. the clonal analysis of these isolates identified  <dig> endemic a. baumannii pfge types, four of which were also epidemic because were involved in nosocomial outbreaks. three a. baumannii nosocomial outbreaks occurred in the studied hospital between  <dig> and  <dig> . the first was in 1999– <dig> in the pneumology area on the hospital’s third floor. this affected  <dig> patients and involved two pfge types: ee <dig> and ee <dig>  both, ee <dig> and ee <dig> were first detected during this outbreak and persisted endemically till  <dig> on the third floor. the second outbreak was in the icu in march  <dig>  with four patients affected. this was caused by pfge type ee <dig>  this same pfge type was found to be endemic between  <dig> and  <dig> on the third, fourth, and fifth floors of the hospital, and in the icu, the emergency room, and out-patient consultation rooms. the third outbreak, from december  <dig> to march  <dig>  also involved the icu and was caused by pfge type ee10; four patients were affected. the remaining  <dig> pfge types  were responsible for no epidemic event, but were found to be endemic; i. e. they were isolated on several occasions in different parts of the hospital environment. the temporal distribution of the  <dig> pfge types was variable; it showed a range from one to six years, highlighting the long persistence of ee <dig>  ee <dig> and ee <dig> during four, five and six years, respectively. the spatial distribution of the  <dig> pfge types was universal in the hospital, although third floor  and icu  were the most affected wards, probably due to the kind of activity and patients cared in these areas. all but three pfge types -ee <dig>  ee <dig>  and ee10- were detected in the third floor, and eight out of fifteen pfge types were detected in the icu. the most ubiquitous pfge types were ee <dig>  ee <dig> and ee <dig>  long persistence, wide distribution and antimicrobial resistance are risk factors for new outbreaks. figure  <dig> shows the temporal and spatial distribution of the  <dig> endemic/epidemic pfge types.

the mlst results correlated with pfge clustering. most of the pfge types  circulating in the hospital during the study period were of sequence type st- <dig> . the majority presence of this clone is usual for spanish hospitals  <cit> , as in other mediterranean countries  <cit> , and indeed other parts of the world  <cit> . a previous study  <cit>  showed that the highly prevalent st- <dig> was detected on pfge types that had very different dna band patterns. this diversity is also detected in this study with the presence of st- <dig> in clusters ee1-ee <dig> and ee <dig> -which showed only 65% genetic similarity-. st- <dig> , has been involved in many nosocomial outbreaks around the world  <cit> , and in the present study was the second most common within pfge types . st- <dig>  and st- <dig>  were the two least common , although both have been described as involved in outbreaks in other spanish hospitals. international clonal complex1/st- <dig>  and sequence types st- <dig> and st- <dig> were not detected in the present study, but all are important nosocomial clones previously detected in spanish hospitals  <cit> .

mlva-8orsay returned a perfect correlation between the l marker allelic profiles and the st results. therefore, mlva-8orsay l marker results correlate with pfge clustering. the same l marker allelic profiles  were even seen for certain pfge types in different clusters, e.g., l markers 7-7-4- <dig>  in clusters ee1-ee <dig> and ee <dig>  the s marker allelic profiles showed a wide diversity. as an example, the same pfge type can show different s marker allelic profiles over short periods  <cit> . for instance, between  <dig> and  <dig>  a change in three s loci was recorded in pfge type ee <dig> . similarly, over the space of just a few months between  <dig> and  <dig> - within the same outbreak - changes in two s loci were recorded in pfge type ee <dig> . in one of the latter loci , the change involved a remarkable descent in the number of tandem repeats from  <dig>  to  <dig> . in fact, the diversity associated with allele  <dig> has led some authors  <cit>  to exclude it in the establishment of mlva complexes. in the present study, the variability associated with the s markers was so great that it was not possible to define criteria for establishing mlva complexes, neither to apply criteria defined by other authors  <cit> . the mlva complexes were therefore defined assuming a 40% genetic similarity cut-off, and full correlation was also seen between the mlst and mlva-8orsay complexes, i.e., st- <dig> with a, st- <dig> with b, st- <dig> with c, and st- <dig> with d .

mlva-8orsay l markers are very useful for establishing phylogenetic relationships because of their stability  <cit> , and reveal relationships similar to those provided by mlst analysis  <cit> . to date, several criteria for the formation of mlva complexes using l and s markers have been proposed for a. baumannii  <cit> . agreement has been achieved with the interpretation of l markers but no consensus has been reached with respect to s markers, −something already achieved for other pathogens  <cit> - specifically with the maximum number of allele and repeat differences that can be accepted to cluster different mlva types into the same mlva complex.

the  <dig> studied pfge types all showed xdr. indeed, three  of the four pfge types involved in the three outbreaks described in the present work, were also resistant to imipenem. resistance is common in a. baumannii nosocomial outbreaks since resistant strains are selected for in hospital environments, especially in high risk areas such as icus  <cit> . other pfge types resistant to imipenem, endemic but not involved in any outbreak, were detected in the present study, such as ee <dig> and ee <dig>  both showed a wide distribution across several areas of the hospital, and were isolated over long time periods . ee <dig> was isolated from  <dig> to  <dig> on the third, fourth, and fifth floors, and ee <dig> was isolated over 2003– <dig> and during  <dig> from the same floors as ee <dig>  in addition to the icu, emergency room, and out-patient clinic consultation rooms.

the susceptibility and β-lactamase results fitted well with the epidemiological data for spain, where the resistance of a. baumannii to carbapenems is basically due to the activity of oxa- <dig> and oxa- <dig>  <cit> . oxa- <dig> activity has been commonly reported around the world, but only recently reported for a. baumannii in spain  <cit> . the idea that interhospital transmission of xdr a. baumannii clones occurs is reinforced by the detection of a common pattern for the adc, oxa- <dig>  and chos genes, and their associated iss, for example as seen in pfge type pairs ee <dig> and ab <dig>  and ee <dig> and ab <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the comparison of the three genotyping methods shows that mlst is very useful in global a. baumannii clonal studies, clustering the isolates into big clones. though laborious, pfge provides essential information in local studies of a. baumannii outbreaks. currently, mlva-8orsay l markers provide similar information than mlst, but it has the drawback that no consensus has been reached regarding the interpretation of s markers. mlva-8orsay could be a better typing method than pfge for a. baumannii if new s markers were added to mlva panel and agreed criteria for mlva clustering were established.

in the present study, the most prevalent was international clone ii , followed by international clone iii , st- <dig> and st- <dig>  the period 1999– <dig> was characterized by the predominant presence of international clone ii. the period 2005– <dig>  however, saw diversification, with the increasing presence of international clone iii , st- <dig> and st- <dig>  extensively drug-resistance was universal and the genes providing resistance to carbapenems were blaoxa-58-like and blaoxa-40-like. the finding of the same β–lactamase pattern in pfge type pairs ee <dig> and ab <dig>  and ee <dig> and ab <dig>  suggests the interhospital transmission of the xdr a. baumannii clones st- <dig> and st- <dig>  finally, this study highlights that the endemic presence of extremely resistant pfge types poses a potential risk for future outbreaks  <cit> . the present results also confirm the persistence of fifteen endemic pfge types in a tertiary care hospital and the involvement of four of them in three outbreaks.
