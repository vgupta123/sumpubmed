BACKGROUND
single nucleotide polymorphisms  represent a robust class of molecular markers  <cit> . snp markers have gained considerable importance in plant genetics and breeding because of their excellent genetic attributes and suitability for genetic diversity analysis and evolutionary relationships  <cit> , understanding of population substructure  <cit> , detection of genome-wide linkage disequilibrium  <cit> , and association mapping of genes controlling complex phenotypic traits  <cit> . detection and assay of snps are amenable to automation and thus useful for high-throughput genotyping  <cit> .

the complete and high-quality sequence of the rice genome  <cit>  has provided a genome-wide snp resource comprising  <dig>  million loci polymorphic between the two major cultivated rice subspecies, indica  and japonica   <cit> . this snp resource is freely accessible at the national center for biotechnology information  snp database  as “reference snps ” with detailed annotation in the rice genome. alternatively, the availability of genomic and expressed sequence tag sequences of multiple rice genotypes in the public domain has enabled identification of snps in silico <cit> . however, efforts to validate the identified snps are limited, which is affecting large-scale genotyping applications in this important crop. an accurate and highly multiplexed snp genotyping assay is thus required to use the vast snp resource  in rice for high-throughput genetic analysis  <cit> . in conjunction with validation, snp genotyping of large sets of the diverse rice germplasm  would enable associating natural genetic variations with polymorphisms caused by selection, population history and breeding system  <cit> . snp genotyping, particularly in regulatory candidate genes for complex traits such as abiotic stress tolerance and their large-scale validation using a diverse rice germplasm panel, would be very significant for identifying novel genes and alleles possibly influenced by phenotypic selection during crop domestication that may account for rich trait diversity available in the germplasm  <cit> . in recent years, transcriptome profiling using rice microarrays  <cit>  and next-generation sequencing  <cit>  has led to identification of a large number of candidate genes for stress tolerance  <cit> . however, functional validation of such a large set of candidate genes in transgenics is not feasible. candidate gene snps and their regulatory sequences can be used to establish a relationship between them and target stress tolerance traits by genetic association. therefore, genotyping a diverse germplasm set using high-throughput genotyping assays is of particular interest for rice breeders to discover functionally relevant genes and new alleles  <cit> .

several snp genotyping assays that were developed in the past have had varying success. these assays used four basic principles:  hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes  <cit> ,  oligonucleotide ligation  <cit> ,  single nucleotide extension  <cit> , and  enzymatic cleavage  <cit> . in recent years it has become feasible to simultaneously genotype large number of snps in a single assay due to innovative combination of miniaturized array platforms with high level of assay multiplexing and scalable automation  <cit> . among these, the goldengate genotyping assay   <cit>  has been widely leveraged to validate the large number of snps in many crops such as barley  <cit> , maize  <cit> , aegilops <cit> , soybean  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , white and black spruce  <cit>  and poplar  <cit> . recently, multiplex panels of  <dig>  snps discovered through whole genome resequencing  <cit>  have been validated using the goldengate assay in rice  <cit> . considering the greater multiplexing and high-throughput snp genotyping potential of the goldengate assay, it would be relevant to utilize this technology for large-scale snp validation and genotyping in stress-responsive rice genes using a diverse germplasm set. this in turn would help develop a gene-based snp panel for defining population genetic structure, as well as diversity and differentiation between rice populations particularly with regard to different ecological habitat adaptation. it would further accelerate the identification of robust, functionally relevant rice genes for complex stress tolerance traits through genome-wide and candidate gene-based association analyses.

we undertook this study to: validate and genotype snps in a set of biotic and abiotic stress-responsive genes on a diverse rice genotype panel using bead-array based illumina goldengate assay; derive the functional significance of such snps in terms of their evolutionary and adaptive advantages for stress tolerance; and determine the population structure in rice.

RESULTS
reproducibility, genotype call rate and success rate of goldengate assay
all  <dig> snp loci selected for arraying had snp designability rank scores equal to or higher than  <dig>  and thus were useful for genotyping using the goldengate assay. genotyping assay reproducibility was 100% as evaluated using four samples as biological replicates — one each representing indica, aromatic, japonica and aus/wild rice groups. of the  <dig> snp loci,  <dig>   could be genotyped successfully on all  <dig> genotypes. at this gentrain cut-off score, the remaining  <dig>  loci did not yield any genotype calls and were thus rejected. distinct cluster separation was observed at ≥ <dig>  gencall and ≥ <dig>  gentrain cut-off scores across the  <dig> snp loci. genotype polar coordinate plots  of these loci were used to classify the  <dig> rice genotypes into one of three clusters:  homozygous aa ,  homozygous bb , and  heterozygous ab .

based on minimum  <dig>  gencall and  <dig>  gentrain cut-off scores optimized in this study,  <dig>  of  <dig>  genotype calls were identified as missing data. the remaining  <dig>  yielded successful genotype calls giving a high average call rate of 98% per valid snp for rice genotypes. when we increased the gen-train score cut-off value to ≥ <dig> , the average missing data rate per successful snp in rice genotypes decreased to ≤ <dig> %. three hundred twenty-five  of the  <dig> snp loci, which produced  <dig>  genotype calls, showed polymorphism  while the remaining  <dig>  were monomorphic. excluding the monomorphic loci, the overall genotyping success rate or snp conversion rate of the goldengate assay was 85% across  <dig> diverse rice genotypes using “rice opa-1”. three hundred twenty-five snp loci validated in the stress-responsive genes were physically mapped  on  <dig> rice chromosomes . the majority of these snps  were present in the coding regions and the rest  in the 5’untranslated regions of the selected genes. the polymorphism rate at these snp loci across chromosomes varied from 75% in chromosome  <dig> to 100% in chromosome  <dig> with an average of 85% . of the  <dig> polymorphic snp loci,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were validated in abiotic and biotic stress-responsive rice genes, respectively.

snp validation in diverse oryza sativa and wild species genotypes
a total of  <dig> snps, consisting of  <dig>  transitions and  <dig>  transversions, were validated using the “rice opa-1” high-throughput bead array-based assay. the higher frequency of transitions versus transversions in validated snps was comparable to the in silico estimate . snp loci that differentiated any two individual genotypes belonging to two different groups were considered polymorphic between the groups to which they belonged. based on this criterion,  <dig>  were polymorphic between o. nivara and o. sativa,  <dig>  between o. rufipogon and o. sativa, and  <dig>  between o. rufipogon and o. nivara . two hundred sixty-two  snps were validated betweeno. nivara and japonica,  <dig>  between o. nivara and indica,  <dig>  between o. nivara and long-grained aromatics, and  <dig>  snps between o. rufipogon and short-grained aromatics. within o. sativa, the most polymorphism was observed between indica and japonica  and the least was between japonica and short-grained aromatics  . among the aromatics,  <dig>  snps were validated between long and short-grained accessions, while  <dig>  were validated between traditional and improved long-grained aromatics. the polymorphic snp loci frequency was highest within indica  and lowest between the two japonica genotypes  .

snp characteristics and functional significance
the functional annotation of  <dig> abiotic stress-responsive rice genes with snps revealed maximum correspondence to stress signal-transduction pathway gene families  followed by transcription factors . the average ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous snps in the coding regions of these genes was  <dig> , which is lower than that estimated  for all  <dig> polymorphic genes. in contrast, snps in the coding regions of  <dig> known and candidate disease resistance genes exhibited a higher average ratio  of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions. a total of  <dig>  snp loci in the abiotic  and biotic  stress-responsive rice genes resulted in non-synonymous substitutions and thus are expected to have affected the encoded proteins. this included snps in nine abiotic stress-related genes that differentiated  <dig> upland indica and two genotypes of wild species from  <dig> lowland indica and  <dig> aromatic rice genotypes. four of these snps — found in a myb family transcription factor, a sucrose transporter, a calcium dependent protein kinase and a wrky family transcription factor  — resulted in missense substitutions and amino acid replacements . the remaining five snps validated in genes encoding cytochrome p <dig>  heat shock protein, pyruvate kinase, translation elongation factor and soluble acid invertase, resulted in introduction of premature termination codons ochre, opal and amber. although biotic stress-responsive genes had more non-synonymous substitutions, none of the corresponding snps differentiated upland indica from lowland indica genotypes. when we considered specific cases, non-synonymous snp loci in two disease resistance-like genes encoding nbs-lrr  and nb-arc domains  differentiated the bacterial leaf blight  resistant indica rice genotypes aditya from blb susceptible aromatic rice genotypes. another two snp loci found in genes containing serine threonine protein kinase  and leucine-rich repeat  domains differentiated eight rice blast resistant indica genotypes  from the susceptible indica genotypes .

we performed an in silico analysis of the structure predicted from amino acid sequences of functional domains to understand the possible biological significance of non-synonymous snp loci in the functional domains carrying nine abiotic stress-responsive genes. results revealed alteration in secondary structure of encoded proteins due to missense and nonsense mutations in the functional domains encoded by the nine abiotic stress-responsive genes that differentiated the upland and lowland genotypes from each other. the variant form in contrast to native form of proteins encoded by three transcription factor genes — wrky, myb and heat shock factor  — showed amino acid sequence change in dna binding/signal sensing domains . for example, the upland rice genotypes had tyrosine  in the conserved dna binding domain  of protein encoded by wrky transcription factor , which was found substituted by serine  in the lowland genotypes. this possibly resulted in decreased binding affinities of wrky domains to invariant ‘tgac’ core of w box. it is likely that substitution mutations in wrky impart differential hydrophobic interactions and beta sheet’s stability thus creating a varied zinc finger and dna binding protein structure between drought tolerant upland and sensitive lowland rice genotypes . however, the remaining six genes  showed variations in the active allosteric regulatory catalytic domain of proteins that bind with substrate and ligand complex . for example, missense substitution of amino acid valine in the glycine-rich atp conserved catalytic domain of protein kinase gene in upland rice genotypes with alanine in lowland genotypes resulted in an altered secondary protein structure. this may affect the peptide-substrate and ca2+ ligand-binding sites of catalytic domain  and phosphorylation activity of the regulated gene. similarly, in four disease resistance genes, missense substitutions of amino acid in the functional domains altered the secondary protein structure that possibly affected dimerization domains and ligand-binding sites.

analysis of molecular diversity, population structure and genetic association
the polymorphism information content  based on snps in the stress-related rice genes varied widely across the  <dig> o. sativa genotypes. higher nucleotide diversity within indica  compared with long  and short  grained aromatics, japonica  and aus/wild species  was evident. we found the average nucleotide diversity  across  <dig> snp loci in candidate abiotic stress response genes to be higher specifically in upland indica genotypes than that observed in the  <dig> candidate biotic stress-related genes .

population genetic structure analysis among the  <dig> genotypes using the bayesian clustering algorithm of structure with varying k  levels revealed that at k value of  <dig> all genotypes were classified into two distinct sub-populations, indica and japonica/aromatic . when the k value was increased to  <dig>  aromatic and japonica groups emerged as independent sub-populations and clustered separately from indica sub-population. the best replicate giving maximum log likelihood values was obtained when k was set at four . at this k value, the genotypes were grouped into four sub-populations that corresponded well with their expected taxonomic and pedigree relationships, which was comparable to the clustering pattern as depicted by the neighbor-joining tree based on pair-wise genetic distances. however, when k value was increased to  <dig>  no additional cluster with high-resolution population structure was obtained, and relationships among genotypes as observed at k =  <dig> remained intact . the rice genotypes used in our study were thus classified into four distinct sub-populations: group i consisting of  <dig> genotypes of traditional and improved high-yielding long and three short-grained aromatics; group ii comprising one genotype each of tropical and temperate japonica and tripura medicinal rice; group iii with  <dig> indica type, five improved high-yielding long-grained aromatics and pusa npt11; and group iv consisting of five indica , two wild species o. rufipogon and o. nivara. molecular genetic variation among and within these four sub-populations  and genetic distance  based on  <dig> snp loci), revealed a wide quantitative genetic differentiation in o. sativa  . pair-wise fst values among these four sub-populations indicated maximum divergence between indica and japonica  and minimum between aromatics and japonica  .

all  <dig> genotypes belonged to a single population in which more than 80% of their inferred ancestry was derived from one of the model-based populations and more than 16% contained admixed populations defined as “admix” . an 18% admixture was observed between the five indica  and the wild oryza species while between japonica and long-grained aromatics it was ~ 8%. tripura medicinal rice had maximum  admixtures of japonica followed by that of indica , traditional basmati , short-grained aromatics  and the wild  species . genomic constitution analysis of rice genotypes based on chromosome-wise physical distribution of variant snp loci and allele sharing between indica and japonica revealed maximum introgression of japonica in chromosome  <dig>  followed by chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig> ; chromosome  <dig> contained maximum introgression  of indica. in contrast there was equal sharing  of genomic regions in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> of japonica and indica. introgression frequency  was the most in chromosome  <dig>  and fewest in chromosome  <dig> . overall, maximum introgression between indica and japonica was observed in tripura medicinal rice , which also exhibited the highest degree of heterozygosity . the allele sharing map  for  <dig> chromosomes of the  <dig> genotypes identified  <dig> large introgression regions carrying  <dig> non-synonymous snp loci in the biotic and abiotic stress-responsive genes that are expected to be under artificial selection pressure. interestingly, one such introgression region on chromosome  <dig> and another on chromosome  <dig>  each containing six snp loci in the abiotic stress-responsive genes, differentiated drought tolerant upland indica and wild rice genotypes from lowland indica and aromatic rice genotypes used in our study.

genetic association analysis using genotyping data of  <dig> snps in stress-responsive genes and phenotypic information of  <dig> rice genotypes belonging to different ecosystems revealed  <dig> non-synonymous snps associated with ecological adaptation at p <  <dig>  and r <dig> ≥  <dig>  . significantly of these, nine snps  showed strong association with ecological adaptation at p <  <dig>  and r <dig> =  <dig> .

discussion
genotyping success rate of goldengate assay and validation of snps in stress-responsive rice genes
illumina goldengate platform has shown exceptional performance with regard to throughput, reproducibility, genotype call rate and assay development success rate among several snp genotyping assays involving human and a few plant species,  <cit> . in our study,  <dig> snp loci with a high predetermined snp designability rank score of ≥ <dig>  were selected to develop a “rice opa-1” array for use with the goldengate platform. the snps were chosen based on their presence in biotic or abiotic stress-responsive genes  and distribution over  <dig> rice chromosomes. genotyping of four biological replicates of dna samples gave 100% reproducibility that suggested robustness of the goldengate assay for snp validation and genotyping in rice. the average genotype call rate of 98% per valid snp at ≥ <dig>  gentrain cut-off score is comparable to that obtained earlier for white and black spruce   <cit>  and human   <cit> , using the same stringent criteria for snp genotyping using the goldengate assay. about 2% genotype calls were identified as missing data at ≥ <dig>  gentrain score, which is comparable to previous reports from other plant species  <cit> .

there was a distinct separation of two homozygous classes expected in true breeding inbred lines for  <dig> snp loci at ≥ <dig>  gencall and ≥ <dig>  gentrain scores used in this study. a high proportion of homozygous  snp calls was expected in view of the highly self-pollinating nature of cultivated rice. with  <dig> validated snp loci, the overall genotyping success rate/snp conversion rate was 85%, which is comparable to the estimate obtained  earlier with goldengate genotyping assay in rice  <cit> . the observed success rate is different from that in other studies   <cit> , which is expected due to species differences, genotypes and snp loci used. the lower snp conversion rate in our study could be due to errors in low quality genome sequence of indica genotype 93– <dig> contributing to false snps at  <dig> of  <dig> loci for which genotype calls were made. with the recent availability of high quality genomic sequence from multiple genotypes  <cit> , miscalled snps due to poor genomic sequence should not be a concern and eliminating possible snp loci lacking necessary flanking sequence specificity for successful conversion should be much easier. overall, our study revealed that a highly multiplexed universal custom snp array “rice opa-1” designed for illumina goldengate assay targeting a set of stress-responsive genes was efficient enough to rapidly genotype rice accessions with high precision and success rate.

the snps validated in coding  and non-coding  sequence regions of stress-responsive genes have the potential to be used as candidate gene-based functional markers for various stress tolerance traits in rice. sixty-eight percent of the snp loci that were found to be polymorphic between indica and japonica in silico contained exactly the same snp alleles between  <dig> indica and two japonica rice genotypes with ±  <dig>  to ±  <dig> % low-end error rate. this is higher than the efficiency range reported  earlier based on direct amplicon sequencing  <cit> . the transition and transversion frequencies obtained in our study are comparable  to that observed in silico between indica and japonica. the relatively higher  frequency of transition substitutions validated between indica and japonica than among indica, aromatic and wild species groups , agreed well with earlier genome-wide snp discovery studies involving indica and japonica rice subspecies  <cit> .

the allele sharing map constructed separately for  <dig> chromosomes of  <dig> rice genotypes identified two large introgression regions carrying each of six snp loci in the abiotic stress-responsive genes that differentiated the known stress tolerant upland indica and wild rice accessions from the sensitive lowland indica and aromatic rice genotypes. it would be interesting to use this snp subset in adaptive trait-specific association analysis. the high and low introgression rates and admixtures revealed by variant snp loci across chromosomes of different domesticated o. sativa and wild species genotype groups in our study reflect differential snp allele sharing between respective gene pools of o. sativa and wild species  <cit> .

functional and adaptive significance of snps validated in stress-responsive rice genes
higher average ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions in the coding regions of biotic stress-responsive rice genes compared to abiotic stress-related genes was possibly due to diverse nature of plant disease resistance proteins that evolved as a result of pathogen pressure  <cit> . detection of nine non-synonymous snp loci showing missense and non-sense mutations in important abiotic stress-responsive rice genes  that differentiated the contrasting known drought-tolerant upland indica rice genotypes from sensitive lowland genotypes suggests the functional significance of snps in these genes  <cit> . further, missense non-synonymous snp loci in the biotic stress response-related genes encoding nbs-lrr and serine/threonine protein kinase domains that differentiated selected upland indica rice genotypes from lowland genotypes may also be relevant for their differential reaction to diseases such as blast and bacterial blight.

correlation between non-synonymous snps in functional domains encoded by nine abiotic stress-responsive genes with alteration in predicted secondary protein structure and catalytic domain binding sites suggests functional relevance of such snps. this was further evident from the high-degree association of these nine non-synonymous snps in genes with upland and lowland adaptive differentiation. for example, the functional significance of one such snp, showing missense substitution in the conserved dna binding domain of protein encoded by wrky transcription factor gene was assessed by correlating its altered secondary protein structure with dna binding and transcriptional activity. differential dna binding selectivity of wrky transcription factor towards consensus ‘tgac’ core of w box due to non-synonymous substitutions and its correlation with differential sensitivity to various abiotic stresses, particularly drought, have been reported previously for arabidopsis thaliana, brassica napus, tobacco and rice  <cit> . the evolutionary and adaptive advantages of such non-synonymous snps in genes that affect the structure and function of encoded proteins to generate favorable alleles for mitigating environmental stress impact under high selection pressure through modulation of mutation in these loci have been reported in eukaryotes  <cit> . for example, in pinus the non-synonymous amino acid substitution in the protein coding regions of drought-responsive genes have provided greater adaptability to various abiotic stresses  <cit> . similarly, the adaptive advantage of non-synonymous snp loci in bacterial blight resistance gene affecting the dimerization and active ligand binding sites of proteins has been demonstrated  <cit> . understanding the adaptive significance of such mutations in genes needs further experimentation using a larger set of contrasting genotypes.

understanding diversity pattern and population genetic structure in rice
the population structure based on  <dig> polymorphic snp loci identified four major model-based genetically distinct groups namely, indica, japonica, aromatics and aus/wild. to generate these four sub-populations, a burn-in length of  <dig>  and run length of  <dig>  iterations was sufficient to obtain reasonably consistent values of maximum log likelihood across  <dig> replicates. this observation is comparable to those based on population structure analysis using microsatellite and snp markers  <cit> . the genetic diversity estimated among the rice sub-populations in our study was much higher than that obtained previously  with microsatellite and snp markers, but comparable  to that detected in a larger set of rice genotypes using microsatellite markers  <cit> .

the higher pic in indica than in aromatic, japonica and aus/wild groups agreed well with earlier observations using microsatellite and snp markers  <cit> . higher nucleotide diversity in indica was most likely the result of strong purifying selection for specific snp-containing genes which was evident from higher pic across snp loci. this could be due to the diverse rainfed/irrigated lowland, medium land and upland rice genotypes included under the indica group which resulted in higher number of polymorphic snp loci detection, and higher modal nucleotide substitution and amino acid replacement than that of other domesticated o. sativa groups. all these observations together suggest higher allelic diversity within indica than aromatics, japonica and aus/wild rice genotypes. the higher nucleotide diversity and pic in long-grained aromatics than short-grained aromatics and aus/wild groups was due to inclusion of traditional basmati, which are selection products from landraces and improved high yielding basmati developed through cross-breeding involving traditional basmati and non-basmati indica varieties  <cit> .

population structure analysis revealed that a set of  <dig> genotypes from four rice sub-populations  had population admixture  with more than one genetic background, which may have resulted from their complex breeding history involving intercrossing and introgression between germplasm coupled with strong selection pressure. this was evident from clustering of five improved high-yielding long-grained basmati within the indica sub-population in our study, which is expected because all improved basmati genotypes were developed through cross-breeding involving non-aromatic indica and traditional basmati germplasm  <cit> . the five indica types such as nagina <dig> that showed about 15% admixture with o. rufipogon were predicted as aus type  <cit>  under this category  <cit> . this observation suggests that aus types most likely evolved through natural cross-hybridization involving wild species, and subsequently were selected and domesticated by farmers. however, a complete understanding about the domestication and evolutionary history of these possible upland aus types and other o. sativa and wild rice sub-populations would require analysis of a greater number of well characterized and known aus type rice cultivars. maximum  admixtures of japonica in tripura medicinal rice support earlier observations on possible inter-ecotype hybridization as evident from japonica type cytoplasm in north-eastern hilly region indica genotypes  <cit> . introgression of different small chromosomal segments of indica and japonica into tripura medicinal rice is possibly because of hybridization of male indica with female japonica followed by cross-hybridization of the resultant hybrid as female with japonica during domestication in north-eastern india. greater than 18% admixture between wild and upland indica rice sub-populations for putative stress gene snps suggests likely introgression of trait-associated genomic regions from wild species into domesticated indica genotypes.

CONCLUSIONS
the results have encouraging implications for use of bead array platform-based illumina goldengate assay for validation and genotyping of snps in a specific set of stress-responsive genes for understanding their functional relevance. the results also suggest the feasibility of using snps as markers in identification and targeted mapping of trait-associated genomic regions for stress tolerance and further for adaptive trait-specific association analysis in rice.
