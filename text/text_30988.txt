BACKGROUND
s. aureus is one of the most prevalent and clinically significant pathogens worldwide, which causes a variety of illnesses, ranging from minor infections of the skin to life-threatening infections with bacteremia, endocarditis, pneumonia and toxic shock syndrome
 <cit> . with the increased use of antimicrobial agents in health care settings, multi-resistant s. aureus isolates have appeared and become the most common cause of nosocomial and community infections around the world
 <cit> . vancomycin is one of the selective drugs for mrsa infections. however, because of poor tissue diffusion and high toxicity, it is often combined with rifampicin for deep-seated infections such as osteomyelitis and endocarditis
 <cit> .

the frequency of the rifampicin-resistant  s.aureus isolates have rapidly increased. in china, the percentage of rif-r mrsa isolates was only  <dig> % in  <dig> and rapidly increased to  <dig> % in 2008
 <cit> . however, no information regarding the molecular mechanism of rifampicin resistance in s. aureus has been available in china. the objectives of the present study were to analyze 1) mutations in the rpob gene that contributed to rifampicin resistance and 2) the molecular mechanisms of rif-r s. aureus in anhui provincial hospital.

methods
hospital setting
anhui provincial hospital, which founded in  <dig>  is a major regional hospital located in the capital of anhui province. it is a nearly 1300-bed tertiary care teaching centre. anhui provincial hospital provides healthcare services to patients from anhui, henan and shandong provinces, and the average number of outpatients is about two million per year. it is also the affiliated hospital of anhui medical university and anhui province medical postgraduate training base of shandong university.

bacterial strains
two hundred and eighty-three s. aureus were isolated from clinical specimens in the microbiology department of anhui provincial hospital from january  <dig> to december  <dig>  eighty-eight rif-r s. aureus isolates were re-identified by the disk diffusion method and used for the present study. the rif-r s. aureus isolates represented 31% of all s. aureus isolates in  <dig>  the origin of the strains was mainly from respiratory samples and also from blood cultures, catheter-related sites, urine samples, wound swabs, respiratory samples and exudates. oral informed consent was given by all patients before taking the clinical specimen. the s. aureus isolates were re-identified by gram’s staining, microscopic examination, coagulase testing and catalase testing. mrsa was initially screened by the cefoxitin disk diffusion method, and then confirmed by polymerase chain reaction  detecting meca.

antimicrobial susceptibility testing
two hundred and eighty-three s. aureus susceptibility to penicillin , ampicillin/sulbactam , cefazolin , vancomycin , erythromycin , clindamycin , rifampicin , linezolid , mupirocin , quinupristin/dalfopristin , tetracycline , trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole , gentamicin , ciprofloxacin , and levofloxacin  were determined by using the disk diffusion method in accordance with standards recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute 
 <cit> . reference strain atcc <dig> was used for quality control. mics of rifampicin for all s. aureus isolates were further determined by the agar dilution method
 <cit> , and s. aureus atcc  <dig> and e.coli atcc <dig> were designated as rif-s and rif-r controls, respectively. according to the clsi criteria
 <cit> , isolates were interpreted as rif-s  and rif-r  isolates.

detection of rifampicin resistance-associated mutations
total dna from s. aureus was purified and used as a template for amplification by pcr. an internal gene sequence of  <dig> bp , was amplified by pcr. this region included the rifampicin resistance-determining cluster i  and cluster ii . the amplification was carried out in  <dig> rif-r strains. amplification was carried out as previously described
 <cit> . the pcr products were purified and analyzed by dna sequencing. the nucleotide sequences obtained were compared to the rpob wild type sequence from s.aureus subsp. aureus  using the clustalw software.

molecular typing
sccmec typing
sccmec typing of mrsa isolates was performed using eight unique and specific pairs of primers for sccmec types and subtypes i, ii, iii, iv and v as described previously
 <cit> .

spa typing
the staphylococcus protein a  variable repeat region from each mrsa isolate was amplified by simplex pcr oligonucleotide primers as previously described
 <cit> . purified spa pcr products were sequenced, and spa types were assigned by using the spa database website .

multilocus sequence typing 
mlst of mrsa isolates was conducted through amplification of internal fragments of seven housekeeping genes of s.aureus as described previously
 <cit> . following purification and sequencing of these genes, allele quantification and sequence typing were assigned using a well-characterized online database .

RESULTS
antimicrobial susceptibility patterns
antimicrobial susceptibility testing by the disc diffusion method revealed that all rif-r s.aureus isolates were mrsa and were resistant to β-lactam, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, levofloxacin, gentamycin and tetracycline. of the s.aureus isolates,  <dig> % were resistant to clindamycin. isolates also displayed low levels of resistance to sulfamethoxazole , quinupristin . there were no vancomycin-resistant s.aureus isolates in our study.

distribution of mutations associated with rifampicin resistance
among the  <dig> rif-r mrsa isolates,  <dig> isolates showed high-level rifampicin resistance  and  <dig> isolates showed low-level rifampicin resistance 
 <cit> . four amino acid substitutions were found in  <dig> rif-r isolates. results are shown in table
 <dig>  mutation at 481his/asn was the most common and found in  <dig> % of rif-r isolates. mutation 466leu/ser was found in  <dig> % of isolates. the remaining mutations included 477ala/asp  and 486ser/leu . five low-level resistant isolates had only one mutation, while  <dig> high-level resistant isolates had two or more mutations. the single mutation 481his/asn and 486ser/leu were conferring low-level rifampicin resistance. two mutations, 481his/asn+466leu/ser, were the most common multiple mutations found in  <dig> %  of samples. the remaining multiple mutated clones consisted of 481his/asn+477ala/asp  and 481his/asn+466leu/ser+477ala/asp .

discussion
multiresistance and high infection rates are common features of s .aureus and are growing problems in hospital settings. the high prevalence of antibiotic resistance in s. aureus nosocomial isolates is currently explained by intensive use of topical and systemic antimicrobial agents in health care settings, which represents a highly selective pressure for antibiotic-resistant bacterial clones
 <cit> . in particular, mrsa strains showed high resistance rates to various antibiotics
 <cit> . the proportion of mrsa isolates has increased in recent years. in china, surveillance data of bacterial resistance in 1998– <dig> showed that the percentage of mrsa was  <dig> %
 <cit>  and rapidly reached  <dig> % in 2010
 <cit> .

rifampicin is an antibiotic of significant interest in the rise of mrsa infections. a combination therapy, with an antibiotic such as vancomycin often is required to reach deep-seated infections effectively. rifampicin acts by interacting specifically with bacterial rna polymerase encoded by the gene rpob <cit> . rifampicin resistance emerges easily in s. aureus, in particular in methicillin-resistant strains
 <cit> .the prevalence of rif-r mrsa has risen rapidly in the past few years and remains at a high resistance rate. in china, the data obtained from the surveillance of bacterial resistance showed that the percentage of rif-r mrsa was  <dig> % in  <dig> and rapidly reached  <dig> % by  <dig>  the percentage remained high from  <dig> to 2009
 <cit> . obviously, the nature of rif-r mrsa isolates represents a therapeutic challenge for treating serious mrsa infections. most rif-r mrsa isolates were high-level resistant in our study and the percentage was found to be  <dig> %. in fact, it was higher than the rate reported in some european countries, such as spain, which had a rate of  <dig> %  in 2010
 <cit> . there were two reasons that could explain the difference between the rif-r rate in china compared to other countries. one possibility was the intensive use of some antimicrobial agents in health care settings in china such as quinolones, which not only could lead to the selection of multi-resistant nosocomial isolates of s. aureus, but also potentially induce endogenous, resistance-conferring mutations in bacterial genes that encode drug targets. a second possibility might be that the prevalence of mrsa clones in china was different from european countries.

for a variety of bacteria, such as e. coli
 <cit> , mycobacterium tuberculosis
 <cit>  and s .aureus <cit> , the main mutations responsible for rifampicin resistance were in a particular region encompassing a few hundred nucleotides called the rifampicin resistance-determining region . in s. aureus the rrdr was divided into two clusters which were designated cluster i  and cluster ii . as described in previous studies, the two clusters were also both closely associated with rifampicin resistance
 <cit> .

here, we have amplified and sequenced portions of rpob from rif-r s.aureus isolates. all four amino acid substitutions we identified were present in cluster i. mutation 481his/asn was the most prevalent one. the majority  of the  <dig> rif-r mrsa isolates harbored the amino acid substitution 481his/asn, which was in line with previous reports
 <cit> . our results further confirm that 481his/asn has a major impact on the occurrence and development of rifampicin resistance in s. aureus. high-level rifampicin resistance may also be attributed to additional mutations within rpob, as previously described
 <cit> . the additional mutations we found were 466leu/ser and 477ala/asp. isolates containing multiple mutations, 481his/asn and 466leu/ser,were reported by other studies, which also showed high-level rifampicin resistance
 <cit> . mutational changes at amino acid position  <dig> have also been reported by several groups
 <cit> , but the mutation rate was low and the types of amino acid substitutions which arose were different.

mrsa infections have been caused by a relatively small number of epidemic mrsa clones. as described in previous studies, the two major epidemic mrsa clones identified in china from  <dig> to  <dig> were st239-mrsa iii and st5-mrsa ii
 <cit> . a pandemic mrsa clone st <dig>  which was found to be derived from st <dig> and st <dig> parental strains through simple chromosome replacement instead of movement of mobile genetic elements, was first found in brazil and widely spread throughout the world
 <cit> . in asia and in china, st <dig> accounted for 97% of nosocomial mrsa infections
 <cit> . st239-mrsa iii was also the major clone found in our study. staphylococcal protein a  is a cell wall anchored virulence factor
 <cit> . our research shows that most strains with rif-r s. aureus belong to st239-mrsaiii-spa t <dig>  a situation in accordance with chen et al.
 <cit> . their research showed t <dig> was up to  <dig> % of mrsa in peking union medical college hospital  in  <dig>  in addition, t <dig> was also found to be rifampicin resistant by chen et al., which was the main difference with t <dig>  our results are in line with these reports. these findings indicate that st239-mrsaiii-spa t <dig> strains, associated with high-level rifampicin resistance, have spread in anhui provincial hospital. therefore, bacterial resistance surveillance and the control of hospital infections should take these findings into consideration in order to prevent and limit the spread of high-level rifampicin resistant s. aureus.

CONCLUSIONS
most rif-r mrsa isolates were high-level resistant in our study. rifampicin-resistance in s .aureus is closely associated with mutations which occur in the rpob gene. st239- mrsa iii-spa t <dig> strains, which was associated with the high-level rifampicin resistance, has spread in anhui provincial hospital.
