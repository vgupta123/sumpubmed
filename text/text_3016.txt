BACKGROUND
sugarcane  is a c <dig> grass with a characteristic ability to accumulate high sucrose concentrations in the culm. sucrose is synthesized in the leaf mesophyll and transported via the phloem primarily through symplastic transport into storage parenchyma  <cit> . accumulation of sucrose in the culm is the net result of sucrose import from the leaf, metabolism within the culm and sucrose export from culm tissue  <cit> . sugarcane culm tissues can accumulate sucrose to a concentration of approximately  <dig> mm in storage parenchyma  <cit> . it has been suggested that the accumulation of sucrose in the storage parenchyma to such a high concentration may cause metabolic stress to tissues and cellular compartments in sugarcane culms. it may also create steep osmotic gradients between compartments with varying sucrose concentrations  <cit> . therefore, cells in the culm must adapt to a range of potentials while maintaining metabolism  <cit> .

previously, numerous genes with various functions were identified as being differentially expressed between immature culm tissue with low sucrose content and mature culm tissue with high sucrose content through analyses of expressed sequence tags   <cit>  and microarray-derived expression data  <cit> . transcripts associated with protein synthesis and primary metabolism were more abundant in immature culms, while transcripts corresponding to genes associated with fibre biosynthesis and abiotic stress tolerance, particularly osmotic and oxidative stress, were more abundant in maturing culms  <cit> . however, genes encoding proteins with known functions related to sucrose metabolism were not highly expressed in culm tissues irrespective of sucrose content  <cit> . casu et al.  <cit>  proposed that sucrose accumulation may be regulated by a network of genes induced during culm maturation which included clusters of genes with roles that contribute to key physiological processes including sugar translocation and transport, fibre synthesis, membrane transport, vacuole development and function, and abiotic stress tolerance. recently, papini-terzi et al.  <cit>  compared the results of a microarray-based expression analysis of  <dig> sugarcane genotypes with variation in sugar content  with that of an earlier study  <cit>  of signal transduction-related gene expression under water deficit and treatment with the stress-related hormone abscisic acid . there was considerable overlap between signalling genes associated with sugar accumulation and those involved in drought adaptation but less so with aba treatment  <cit> . thus, a more detailed comparison of the expression of stress-responsive genes in relation to sucrose accumulation and water deficit is warranted.

to maintain turgor or pressure potential under osmotic stress, plants synthesise metabolites such as sugars, polyols, amino acids and betaines that have a role in protecting membranes and maintaining osmotic potential  <cit> . as compatible solutes or osmoprotectants, these metabolites may have a role in adaptation to protect metabolism under conditions of high solute concentration such as that present in sugarcane storage cells. if the sucrose content in the cytoplasm of storage parenchyma is low, some stress-related genes including those involved in the synthesis of osmoprotectants, may have a role in protecting the cells, and maintain pressure potential by providing compatible solutes in the cytoplasmic compartment. alternatively, if the sucrose content in the cytoplasm is high, osmoprotectants as well as protein chaperones may be involved in the protection of protein and membrane structure in the cytoplasm. at the molecular level, a number of genes in plants that are induced by osmotic stress, some with roles in osmoprotection, have been identified and characterized, and the function of these genes have been examined through the use of transgenic plants of various species to demonstrate their role in stress tolerance  <cit> .

the expression of stress-related genes in different parts of the sugarcane culm raises the question of the role of these genes in maturing sugarcane internodes. one hypothesis is that the expression of stress-related genes, and the consequential cellular responses, would facilitate the accumulation of high levels of sucrose. this study investigated whether the degree of expression of stress-related genes, was correlated with the sucrose content in the sugarcane culm, and whether such genes were also responsive to water deficit stress. therefore, known stress-related genes were selected for expression analysis to identify genes with transcript levels that correlated with sugar content in culm and leaf tissues. expression patterns of a sub-set of these genes that were associated with sucrose accumulation were analysed across  <dig> genotypes of sugarcane and its relatives to further test the correlation of gene expression with sucrose accumulation in the culm. the expression of this sub-set of genes was subsequently examined in plants of one cultivar undergoing water deficit. the functional identity of these genes provides a basis for the prediction and comparison of mechanisms that potentially allow the accumulation of sucrose to high levels in sugarcane and tolerance to water deficit.

RESULTS
stress-related gene expression and sucrose content at different developmental stages
analysis of sugars
stem and leaf tissues derived from mature plants of the cultivar q <dig> were analysed for their content of three relevant sugars. glucose and fructose concentrations were both lower in the last fully-expanded leaf  and more mature internodes  than i4- <dig> and i7- <dig> . the concentration of sucrose was lowest in the leaf and i4- <dig>  and increased down the culm to a concentration of  <dig> mg per g fw in internodes 13- <dig>  these changes in sucrose concentration were in accordance to previous analyses of changes of sucrose during sugarcane growth and development  <cit> .

expression of stress-related genes
the relative abundance of transcripts of the  <dig> genes in different parts of mature plants of cultivar q <dig> was determined using real time quantitative pcr  analysis of total rna samples derived from the lfe, i4- <dig>  i7- <dig> and i13- <dig>  transcript expression levels were standardized to transcripts of gapdh as a reference gene because this gene is known to be expressed at a relatively constant level in leaves, and immature and mature internodes of cultivar q <dig>  <cit> .

differential expression was observed between the leaf and different culm tissues for transcripts encoding proteins with probable roles in amino acid, polyamine, sugar and polyol metabolism, sugar transport, chaperone functions and transcriptional regulation. of the  <dig> genes tested,  <dig> genes showed higher expression in the most mature internodes of the culm than in the leaf. of these  <dig> genes, nine were more highly expressed in the older internodes, i13- <dig>  compared to the younger internodes, i4- <dig> .

amean values within a gene with the same letter are not significantly different based on lsd test  from one-way analysis of variance .

genes with statistically significant up-regulated expression in older internodes when compared to young internodes  were those encoding the putative chaperones dehydrin and late embryogenic abundant  protein; enzymes involved in proline metabolism, ornithine aminotransferase  and proline oxidase ; the trehalose degradative enzyme, trehalase; a spermidine synthase gene ; and asparagine synthase . transcription factors with bzip , myb  or erf  family domains were also more highly expressed in the older culm internodes than the leaf. genes encoding the sugar transporters pst <dig>  pst <dig>  pst2a and pst2b were more highly expressed in the mature internodes than leaf. expression level of pst <dig> increased down the culm, while, pst <dig> was expressed at a higher level in i4- <dig> than in i13- <dig>  fifteen of the genes were down-regulated in at least one part of the culm when compared to the leaf. for example, in contrast to the other sugar transporters, the sucrose transporter shsut <dig> was up-regulated in the leaf and the young internodes  when compared to the mature culm. the remaining genes did not show altered expression levels in the leaf compared to the culm. of these, the tonoplastic intrinsic protein  was previously shown to be down-regulated in more mature internodes  <cit>  but not in this study.

eight genes were selected to further examine their relationship with sucrose content. oat, pox, as, lea, dehydrin, and pst <dig> genes were selected as they were all up-regulated in the older culm internodes. since the oat and pox genes are both involved in proline metabolism, p5cs was also included in the selected genes as it catalyzes the synthesis of a primary precursor for proline biosynthesis in plants and also showed a trend  of increased expression with culm maturity. the bzip transcription factor-encoding gene tf <dig> was also included in this group as it was the only gene encoding a transcription factor that showed a trend to increased expression in the most mature internode, and also had relatively low expression in the leaf compared to the culm.

expression of the eight selected genes and amino acid content in sugarcane genotypes varying in sugar accumulation
gene expression
expression of the eight selected genes was determined for several sugarcane varieties and closely-related sugarcane progenitor genotypes varying in sucrose content. the sucrose content of the most mature internodes sampled from plants ranged from  <dig> -  <dig> mg/g fw. rna was also isolated from the lowest culm internodes . the expression levels of oat , pst <dig>  and as  transcripts were positively correlated  with sucrose content, whilst those of p5cs  and tf <dig>  were significantly  negatively correlated with sucrose content . however, dehydrin, lea and pox transcript levels had no significant correlation with sucrose content  .

amino acid content
in the previous experiment, a number of transcripts encoding enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism  showed significant relationships with sucrose content. therefore, free amino acids were measured to determine any changes in the metabolite pool in relation to sucrose content. the analysis was initially conducted by hplc because this method has been used previously to measure free amino acids in sugarcane  <cit> . this analysis also avoided the interference caused by high sucrose content when using biochemical or colorimetric assays  <cit> . tejera et al.  <cit>  reportedly measured seventeen amino acids using this method , however, several amino acids were not detected by this hplc method. further analysis showed that, based on retention time, proline co-eluted with Î³-amino butyric acid , asparagine with serine, histidine with glutamine, and threonine with citrulline. this was a particular problem as accurate measurement of proline was essential. these analyses suggest that the methodology used by tejera et al.  <cit>  was not suitable for our purpose and other methods were sought.

consequently, samples were tested by uplc which has greater resolving power. twenty amino acids were measured by uplc in the most mature internodes from diverse sugarcane genotypes . the five amino acids with the highest concentrations in almost all genotypes were asn, gln, ser, gaba and glu. moreover, q <dig> had much higher levels of asn, gln, ala and val than other genotypes. the results also suggested that there was no major difference in the profile of amino acids between the low and high sucrose content genotypes. interestingly, pro concentration was negatively correlated with sucrose content . among the  <dig> protein amino acids analysed, only pro and leu were significantly correlated with sucrose content and showed a negative correlation . the result for pro was in accordance with the negative correlation of expression of the gene encoding the proline biosynthetic enzyme p5cs with sucrose content.

gene expression, sugar and amino acid content in sugarcane cultivar q <dig> under water deficit stress
physiological responses to water deficit stress
sugarcane plants  were grown in pots for approximately five months as detailed in the methods and then watering ceased on a sub-set of plants in order to assess the effect of water deficit stress on gene expression. relative water content , photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance were measured to monitor the development of stress. by three days after the cessation of watering, the photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance of the last fully expanded leaf had dropped to almost zero, indicating that the plants were experiencing very severe stress . there were no significant changes in photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance of the control plants between the start and end of the experiment. rwc of leaves from plants subjected to water deficit stress decreased  <dig> days after the cessation of watering . the photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and rwc of the stressed plants decreased progressively over two weeks of water deficit stress while that of the control plants was unchanged .

awithin each row, numbers with different letters are significantly different .

sugar content of sugarcane under water deficit stress
glucose and fructose levels, on a dry weight basis, were similar in all tissues except for the lowest internode . despite the moisture content of the lowest internodes from the different treatments being the same, both glucose and fructose were elevated in the internodes from the plants undergoing water deficit. on a dry weight basis, sucrose content in leaves was greatly reduced three days after imposition of stress conditions , and remained lower up to  <dig> days after water deficit commenced . the sucrose content in the culm internodes from plants under water deficit were the same as controls . the similar moisture and sucrose contents between mature internodes from plants undergoing water deficit and the well-watered controls means that the responses in metabolism and gene expression in the plants undergoing water deficit were not confounded by changes in sucrose concentration.

expression of stress-related genes in response to water deficit
the expression of the eight genes selected from the previous experiment  was compared in plants treated with water deficit stress. expression analysis was carried out on rna isolated from the young culm internodes  and mature culm  which have very different sucrose content.

almost all of the selected genes were up-regulated under the 15-day water deficit stress regime when compared with the well-watered control plants. the exception was pox, which was down-regulated, as may be expected for a catabolic enzyme . expression of p5cs, oat, as, pst <dig> and tf <dig> transcripts was induced less than 10-fold, and was generally not significantly different between the young and mature culm internodes. however, lea and dehydrin transcripts were dramatically induced by water stress, up to 100- and 1000-fold respectively, in both i4- <dig> and the lowest internodes. differences in gene expression under water stress between immature and mature culms could be related to the differences in the water content in the two different tissues. the moisture content in i4- <dig> dropped much more over the  <dig> days of water stress, from 90% to 79%, compared to the lowest internodes where the moisture content remained stable at approximately 70% over the  <dig> days . therefore, even in the absence of a change in moisture and sugar content in the lowest internodes, a mechanism inducing expression of abiotic stress-related genes was in operation. this mechanism responded to water deficit stress independently of sucrose accumulation.

amino acid content of sugarcane tissue under water deficit
the levels of almost all amino acids increased after  <dig> days of water stress when compared with those of control plants . proline increased after three days of stress treatment relative to that of the t <dig> sample and continued to increase until  <dig> days of treatment in both the i4- <dig> and the lowest internodes . however, there were no changes in proline content in the well-watered control plants after  <dig> days. although the proline content increased dramatically in the i4- <dig> and the lowest internodes in water deficit stressed plants, it only reached concentrations equivalent of 54- <dig> nmole/g fw. therefore, proline was far from being the most abundant or most highly induced amino acid in the water-stressed samples. increasing levels of all amino acids were measured mostly after three or seven days of the water deficit stress . asparagine and phenylalanine levels increased greatly after  <dig> days of water stress in both young and mature culm internodes. the most abundant amino acid after water deficit stress was asparagine, which increased over 20-fold, to levels equivalent to ~ <dig> nmoles/g fw in both the i4- <dig> and li samples. however, the content of some amino acids, e.g. aspartic acid and glutamic acid, appeared to increase at early stages of stress  but subsequently decreased after  <dig> days of stress. glutamic acid content was significantly lower after  <dig> days stress in both internodes.

discussion
it has been postulated that the accumulation of sucrose to a high concentration in sugarcane culm tissue may cause stress in the storage as well as non-storage cells due to the high solute concentrations in storage cells, and associated osmotic gradients between culm cell types  <cit> . therefore, sugarcane culm cells are likely to have some adaptive mechanisms to protect and maintain their metabolism. a potential adaption is that stress tolerance mechanisms that facilitate cellular function under high solute load may be activated in sugarcane culms. these may be similar to those activated during other stresses that also lead to reduced osmotic potential such as water deficit stress. large scale gene expression profiling has provided evidence that many transcripts with functions related to abiotic-stress tolerance and water deficit stress were abundant in internodes with a higher sucrose content  <cit> . however, as no expression studies in sugarcane have yet been able to assay all of the genes present in sugarcane, additional genes not present in all of these earlier studies, were also chosen.

this study has found that the expression of a number of genes involved in abiotic stress responses showed significant correlative relationships with sucrose content in sugarcane, not only across various culm tissues, but also across the mature culms of diverse saccharum genotypes. some transcripts that showed a positive correlation with sucrose content encoded predicted proteins with functions in the biosynthesis of proline  and asparagine  and sugar transport . a negative correlation of expression with sucrose content across genotypes was also demonstrated for genes encoding an enzyme in an alternative proline biosynthetic pathway  and the bzip transcription factor tf <dig> which may have a regulatory function.

expression levels of the putative sugar transporter pst <dig> showed a positive correlation with sucrose content both down the culm tissues and across diverse genotypes. the pst <dig> sequence is homologous to sugar transporter-like proteins from arabidopsis that are a part of the erd- <dig>  group of transporters  <cit> . the erd genes were induced in arabidopsis by drought treatment and erd- <dig> responds to both water deficit and cold. the pst <dig> gene appeared to be induced weakly by water deficit in sugarcane. the transporter encoded by pst <dig> has recently been localised to the tonoplast and may play a role in remobilisation of sugars from the vacuole  <cit> . since sugar transport is a key component of current models for sugar accumulation in sugarcane culm tissue  <cit> , the correlation of pst <dig> gene expression with sucrose content should stimulate interest in further functional analysis of a possible rate limiting role for this transporter in the sugar accumulation process.

ten groups of bzip transcription factors have been identified in arabidopsis  <cit> . they have been demonstrated to have roles in biotic and abiotic stress responses, as well as plant development  <cit> . the bzip transcription factor gene tf <dig> trended to higher expression in older culm tissue of q <dig>  but when tested across diverse genotypes, it was negatively correlated with final sucrose content. this suggests that the increased level of expression of tf <dig> reached in mature internodes may either be required for increased regulation of sucrose accumulation or be a response to it. the bzip transcription factor with the closest homology to tfi is the ocs binding factor  <dig>  from maize  <cit>  and, like the most similar bzip transcription factor in arabidopsis , it has been linked to defence mechanisms to counter biotic stress  <cit> . some bzip transcription factors are regulated by sugar levels in other plants, such as atbzip <dig> of arabidopsis, which is repressed by sucrose, but also co-regulates the expression of asparagine synthetase  <dig> and proline dehydrogenase  <dig>  linking sugar content with asparagine and proline metabolism  <cit> . however, atbzip <dig> is in the sequence group s of bzip transcription factors  <cit>  while tf <dig> is most homologous to members of group d  <cit> . in sugarcane, gupta et al.  <cit>  showed 12-fold induction of a bzip transcription factor after leaves were treated with  <dig> mm mannitol for nine hours, suggesting a role in osmotic stress tolerance. again, this bzip protein was quite different to tf <dig>  belonging to group g  <cit>  and herein tf <dig> was only moderately induced during the osmotic stress caused by water deficit. functional analysis of tf <dig> would be required in transgenic sugarcane to test the role in sucrose accumulation and any role in cross-regulation of amino acid metabolism.

the accumulation of particular amino acids is one of the responses of plant cells to osmotic stress. our results showed transcripts predicted to encode proteins involved in proline metabolism  appeared to be up-regulated in the mature culm. the main pathway for proline synthesis is believed to be from glutamate, which is directly converted to glutamic semialdehyde  by the enzyme p5cs , with gsa being then converted to p5c  by spontaneous cyclization. p5c is then reduced to proline by p5c reductase   <cit> . oat encodes the enzyme in a secondary pathway of proline biosynthesis which converts arginine to ornithine and then via several intermediate steps to proline. in our data describing the between-genotype comparison, there was a significant positive correlation  between p5cs expression and the free proline content, while oat expression was correlated negatively with proline content. these correlations are consistent with proline synthesis being predominantly genetically regulated through p5cs expression and synthesised via the glutamate pathway rather than via ornithine.

proline is a well known compatible solute as well as an antioxidant and osmoprotectant  <cit> , and can accumulate to high concentrations in plant cells under osmotic stress  <cit> . in tobacco, proline accumulated from  <dig>  to  <dig>  Î¼moles/g fw after  <dig> days of drought treatment  <cit> , while in rice, proline concentration increased about five-fold  under salt stress  <cit> . the analysis of free proline in the culm also indicated a significant negative correlation with sucrose content, which was consistent with a similar negative correlation of expression of the major biosynthetic gene p5cs. the decrease in proline levels in culm tissues with higher sucrose content clearly contradicts the possibility that proline plays a role in osmoprotection associated with sucrose accumulation in the culm. previous studies have suggested that proline is one of the major free amino acid in sugarcane culms  <cit> . however, our refined analysis of this amino acid indicates that it accumulated at low levels in mature sugarcane culms , and even under water deficit stress it increased only to 54- <dig> nmoles/g fw, which is a much lower proline concentration than detected in other plant species undergoing osmotic stress. therefore, our results do not support a role of proline as an osmoprotectant during sucrose accumulation and question whether it has a significant role even under water deficit stress. a study of proline biosynthesis in leaves of control and transgenic sugarcane plants expressing a heterologous p5cs gene has also questioned a potential role for proline in osmotic adjustment under water deficit and alternatively suggested a role as an antioxidant, where lower concentrations may be effective  <cit> .

levels of most of the free amino acids measured were elevated under water stress both in young and mature parts of the culm, resulting in an approximately seven-fold increase in the total amino acid content. the expression of the as gene, encoding a transaminase responsible for the synthesis of asparagine from aspartate and glutamine  <cit> , was positively correlated with sucrose accumulation in developing culms and across diverse genotypes. however, there was no clear relationship between the levels of free asparagine with sucrose content. asparagine accumulated to high levels in plants exposed to water deficit , suggesting that this amide may have some role in adaptation to water deficit stress in sugarcane. these differences in asparagine responses suggest metabolic differences exist between the cellular adaptation mechanisms associated with high solute loads resulting from sucrose accumulation and the adaptation response to water deficit stress.

genes that were highly induced under water deficit were not correlated with sucrose content in the culm across different genotypes. the genes encoding protein chaperones, lea and dehydrin, were dramatically induced by water deficit by more than a 100-fold, with greater fold induction in the immature culm when compared to the mature culm. these types of chaperones play a role in the protection of proteins from degradation and the action of proteinases  <cit> . the lea gene family was first identified as genes induced in seeds during maturation and desiccation  <cit> , while in vegetative tissues, lea proteins are induced by osmotic stress and aba  <cit> . in our study, lea and dehydrin were elevated in the mature internodes of q <dig> when compared to the other tissues. these genes were not reported as being up-regulated by rodrigues et al.  <cit> , when comparing well-watered and droughted young sugarcane plants but this is because clones for these genes were not represented on their array. a clone encoding dehydrin  was included in the array used by papini-terzi et al.  <cit>  and they observed that it was more highly expressed in more mature internodes, but less well-expressed in high brix plants when compared to low brix plants. when the same clone was compared in plants subjected to water deficit by roca et al.  <cit> , expression was elevated in above ground tissue after  <dig> hours. in our study, there was no significant difference in the expression of this dehydrin gene in mature internodes of genotypes with varying sucrose content but it was also strongly expressed after water deficit.

other genes whose transcript expression levels were significantly positively or negatively correlated with sucrose content in the culm, were only slightly induced by water stress. transcripts of genes associated with amino acid metabolism, such as p5cs, oat and as, were induced more than 10-fold during water stress, especially in the immature culm tissue. however, the expression of pox, a gene encoding an enzyme that hydrolyses proline to p5c, was extremely suppressed in the mature culm under water deficit. this probably explains the increase in proline content under water deficit stress, both in immature and mature culms. conversely, the expression levels of the bzip tf <dig> transcription factor and the putative sugar transporter pst <dig> were only slightly increased in response to the water stress treatment, yet their expression patterns correlated with the level of sucrose accumulation across a range of genotypes.

CONCLUSIONS
whilst we have not assessed the expression of all of the genes of sugarcane, correlative experimental evidence suggests that the expression of the genes related to the molecular processes studied involving osmoprotectants, water and ion movement and chaperones may not limit sucrose accumulation in the sugarcane culm. however, a stress-related transcription factor and sugar transporter may play a role in sucrose accumulation. we also found that protection against any stress caused by sucrose accumulation appears to use different mechanisms to those used to protect from stress induced by water deficit. sucrose accumulation is a complex process and it is likely that there are other mechanisms beyond those explored herein that act to limit sucrose accumulation.
