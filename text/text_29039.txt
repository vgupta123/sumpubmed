BACKGROUND
bananas and plantains are large herbaceous monocots from the genus musa of the family musaceae. the vast majority of cultivated bananas are hybrids derived from natural inter- and intraspecific crosses between two diploid wild species, musa acuminata  and m. balbisiana   <cit> . these diploid, triploid or tetraploid hybrids are of great economic importance in sub-saharan africa, south and central america and asia, where they are a staple food for an estimated  <dig> million people. although musa spp. are mainly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions, rain water supply is often far from uniform so that more or less-pronounced dry seasons exist which have an impact on fruit quality and yields. to date there have been few comparative studies on musa drought stress tolerance, but field observations suggest that b-genome confers greater tolerance to drought than the a-genome  <cit> .

plants display a wide range of overlapping responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, and the diversity of physiological, biochemical and molecular strategies adopted during adaptation to unfavourable environmental conditions , creates particular problems for the scientist wishing to study and understand them  <cit> . non-biased, 'systems-wide' approaches such as transcriptomics and microarray rna-profiling are well-suited to the analysis of this type of problem and have provided many insights into the pathways of biotic stress response and adaptation in a variety of model plant systems  <cit> . however, while cdna and oligonucleotide microarrays are now routinely used for transcriptomic analyses in plants, the number of species for which commercial microarrays are available is very limited. for non-model plant species such as musa where little sequence information is available, microarray development costs are so substantial as to be prohibitive for most groups working in the area. however it has been recently demonstrated that commercially available high-density oligonucleotide microarrays from closely related, heterologous species can be used to probe the transcriptomes of non-model plants. for example the arabidopsis affymetrix ath- <dig> genome array has been used to study the transcriptome of brassicacea species such as arabidopsis halleri  <cit> , thlaspi caerulescens  <cit> , thelungiella halophila  <cit> , brassica oleracea  <cit>  and brassica napus  <cit> . in addition a tomato array has also been used to study fruit ripening and development in tomato, aubergine and pepper  <cit> , as well as in potato  <cit> .

in spite of the economic and social importance of banana and plantains and its relatively small haploid genome size  of  <dig> -  <dig> mbp  <cit> , little sequence information is publicly accessible. available published data includes the complete sequencing of two bac clones from a wild diploid banana cultivar  <cit> , the analysis  <dig>  bac end-sequences  <cit>  and recently the sequencing of  <dig> bac clones and the analysis of  <dig> bac clones collectively containing a total of  <dig> predicted genes  <cit> . in addition,  <dig>  unique foliar  <dig> bp transcript sequences were sequenced and identified in the cultivar musa acuminata following supersage  <cit> . the only transcriptomics study published to date however, describes the creation of cdna libraries from musa plants subjected to temperature stress. this lead to the identification of  <dig>  high-quality sequences, of which  <dig> where considered to be full-length cdna clones representing a set of  <dig> unique genes.  <cit> . the aim of the work presented here therefore was to determine the feasibility of using commercial heterologous oligonucleotide microarrays to probe the musa transcriptome in response to drought stress in the relatively drought-tolerant musa triploid cultivar 'cachaco' . the use of highly standardized, commercial affymetrix genechips® arrays allows comparisons to be made with probe-set data sets from other plant species and helps to reduce cross-laboratory errors. because of the phylogenetic relationship between target and probe, this work with musa necessarily involves cross-hybridising to species that are evolutionarily much more distant than has previously been attempted.

clearly the success in identifying differentially-regulated transcripts via cross-hybridisation depends on the degree of similarity between the target and probe sequences. with the affymetrix genechip® genome array, the expression level of any one particular gene transcript is generally calculated as the mean of the expression levels of the  <dig> -  <dig> perfect match   <dig> bp probe-pairs that make up the 'probe-set' for each individual transcript. therefore inefficient hybridisation of transcripts from the test species of interest to the genechip® target probes, due for example to the presence of sequence polymorphisms, will affect the overall signal calculated across a probe-set, reducing the number of 'present' calls, and as a consequence the mean strength of the signal for that transcript's probe-set  <cit> . to eliminate non-hybridising probes, hammond et al, first carried out a cross-hybridisation with gdna from the test organism. the results allow a 'probe mask' to be created by which weak- or non-hybridising probes can be discarded without discarding the signal for the entire probe-set for a particular transcript in subsequent analyses  <cit> . the disadvantage of this method is that it can realistically only be used on microarray platforms that contain multiple probes per gene. applying it to arrays with only one probe per gene  will result in a much lower number of genes for which expression levels can be determined. an alternative approach is to create a 'global match file' or a list of 'highly reliable' genechip® probe-sets for analysis based on alignment to est-derived clusters/singletons. this latter heterologous hybridisation approach has been used to study cold-induced sweetening of potato tubers using the affymetrix tomato microarray  <cit> , but its success depends on the availability of extensive est sequences to create the global match file, and these are not yet available for musa. interestingly, gdna-based probe selection has recently been shown to also improve the analysis of differentially expressed genes in homologous species, again by accounting for the impact of differences in the physical hybridisation characteristics of individual probes on probe-set signal intensities  <cit> .

here we report on work to evaluate the use of commercial, high-density affymetrix rice and arabidopsis ath- <dig> genechip® microarrays to analyse complex plant responses in a distantly-related, non-model plant species. using a gdna probe-based cross-hybridisation approach we were able to rapidly profile the response of musa transcriptome to chronic drought stress, and to identify a range of structural and regulatory musa gene-homologues previously found to be associated with the water-deficit response in other  plants. further, despite the large phylogenetic difference between musa target and the rice or arabidopsis probes, comparisons to publically available transcriptome-profiling experiments identified a range of common drought-responsive genes, supporting the assigned musa gene identities and descriptions. this approach outlines the potential of this strategy for the characterization of stress-resistance in banana and plantain varieties for which relatively little sequence information is currently available.

RESULTS
microarrays for a number of plant species are now commercially available. of these, the arabidopsis ath- <dig> genechip® genome array is probably the best-characterised/annotated, containing over  <dig>  probe-sets representing ~ <dig>  genes . similar high density oligonucleotide affymetrix microarrays also exist for important monocotolydenous crops, including maize, wheat, barley and sugar cane, but the affymetrix rice genome array contains many more probe-sets , and covers a larger portion of the transcriptome than these other arrays.

gdna cross-hybridisations and creation of probe mask  files
each individual gene transcript on the affymetrix rice and arabidopsis ath- <dig> genechip® microarray, is represented by a set of eleven,  <dig> bp 'probe-pairs' that make up a 'probe-set', and it is the average hybridisation intensity across this probe-set that is used to calculate expression levels for that gene. to identify and eliminate oligonucleotide genechip® probes with low or no-hybridisation to musa transcripts, we used the gdna probe-masking strategy of hammond et al  <cit> . here, 'cachaco' genomic dna  was first hybridised to both the arabidopsis ath- <dig> and the rice genechip® genome array using standard affymetrix hybridisation protocols. from the resultant gdna cell intensity file  file, perfect match probe-pairs showing a high hybridisation signal to musa gdna were selected and probe masks  then created to exclude non-hybridising probe-pairs within each transcript probe-set. the hybridisation intensity threshold for probe exclusion is set arbitrarily and ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig>  the minimum requirement for a probe-set to be called 'present' therefore is hybridisation to at least one probe-pair within that probe-set.  <cit> . the resultant probe mask  files are then used to analyze gene expression levels following cross hybridisation of musa rna samples to the genechip®. the influence of hybridisation intensity thresholds on probe and probe-set retention for both the ath- <dig> and rice genome arrays following cross hybridisation to musa gdna is shown in figure 1

as can be seen in figure  <dig>  the number of probes retained decreases rapidly with increasing hybridisation intensity threshold  values, while the number of probe-sets  retained decreases relatively slowly and only at higher cdf values. as a result the number of probe-sets retained for transcriptome analysis within a probe mask file remains high, even as more probes are excluded. for example after cross hybridisation to the rice genome array, a probe mask created at a cdf value of  <dig>  excludes  <dig> % of the total pm probes, even though some  <dig> % of the probe-sets are still represented by at least one probe-pair and can be used for subsequent transcriptome profiling. this is similar to the results obtained by hammond et al following cross-hybridisation of b. oleracea and thlaspi arvense sp. gdna to the ath- <dig> genome array  <cit> . in our case the average number of probes present per probe-set at an optimum cdf value of  <dig> was  <dig> , with a total of  <dig>  probe-sets being represented by a single probe-pair.

following hybridisation of 'cachaco' gdna to the ath- <dig> genome array, only  <dig>  probe-sets were retained at a cdf value of  <dig> . this corresponds to ~ <dig> % of the total available arabidopsis transcriptome. however at a cdf value of  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> % of the available arabidopsis transcriptome was retained. unsurprisingly, hybridisation of 'cachaco' gdna to the rice genome array produced far better results, with over  <dig>  probe-pairs corresponding to over  <dig>  probe-sets  being retained at a cdf value of  <dig>  these results therefore broadly confirm the phylogenetic relationships between musa and either arabidopsis or oryza with current estimates indicating that musa and oryza diverged at the level of the order zingiberalae some  <dig> mya, while the closest evolutionary link between arabidopsis and musa occurs at the point that the eudicots diverged some  <dig> -  <dig> mya  <cit> . interestingly the existence of regions of microsynteny between rice, arabidopsis and musa have recentlybeen demonstrated  <cit> . for example, even though musa genes generally have a gc structure more closely resembling rice than arabidopsis, out of  <dig> musa predicted proteins,  <dig> and  <dig> had hits with an e-value threshold of 1e- <dig> to rice and arabidopsis respectively.

on the basis of the gdna hybridisation results presented here and the closer synteny of musa gene sequences to rice rather than arabidopsis  <cit> , transcriptomics experiments were carried out with the rice genechip® array rather than with the arabidopsis ath- <dig> genechip array.

rna hybridisations - measuring transcript abundance
the response of the musa transcriptome to chronic drought stress was examined by challenging rice genome arrays with 'cachaco' foliar rna, isolated and pooled from plants subjected to either  <dig> weeks water-deficit conditions or to control conditions, as described in 'methods'. the ability to detect differentially-expressed transcripts depends upon the hybridisation intensity threshold cut off values  used to create the probe mask  files as summarised in figure  <dig>  as can be seen, there is a significant loss in the number of probe-sets retained at higher cdf values, but the number of differentially-regulated genes identified is still greater than when no probe-masking is used  <cit> . indeed at the optimum cdf value, over 40-fold more >2-fold drought-responsive transcripts are identified than is the case without masking .

as shown in figure  <dig>  the maximum number of differentially-expressed transcripts was detected using a cdf value of  <dig>  at this cut off level, a total of  <dig>   of the maximal  <dig>  probe-sets hybridised to musa rna at levels above background suggesting that ~16% of the available musa genome was being expressed at any one time. based on a single biological replicate,  <dig>  transcripts of these transcripts displayed a >2-fold difference in expression levels in response to drought conditions, representing ~8% of the total available transcriptome .

this value is similar to values reported in other transcriptomic studies of plant drought stress-responses. for example talame et al  <cit>  using a cdna microarray found  <dig> barley genes out of the  <dig> genes tested , to be differentially regulated following  <dig> days dehydration stress and seki et al  <cit> , found that  <dig> genes from a cdna array of  <dig>  genes , were drought-responsive in arabidopsis. clearly these responses are dependent on the tissue, the severity and length of exposure to stress, as well as the sampling time points  <cit> .

of the  <dig>  differentially-regulated putative drought-responsive transcripts detected,  <dig>  were up-regulated , with the most responsive transcript , increasing  <dig> -fold in relation to the control. the remaining  <dig>   transcripts were down-regulated, with the transcript coding for a putative chlorophyll a apoprotein , being down-regulated over 100-fold.

gene ontologies
the rice descriptions and annotations for these  <dig>  drought-responsive musa transcripts were obtained from the list of rice genechip® probe-set i.d.s using the harvest software available at . from this list,  <dig>  genes  could also be assigned an arabidopsis annotation using the same software. these arabidopsis annotations were then used for gene ontology  classifications using the 'gene ontology' function at the tair website . results are summarised in table  <dig> 

functional category
as shown in table  <dig>  the distribution of >2-fold differentially-regulated transcripts between go classes is similar for both up- and down-regulated transcripts, with in both cases the largest proportion  being represented by 'other biological', 'other metabolic' or 'other cellular' groups. however in agreement with models for plant water-deficit stress responses, there was a general up-regulation of genes involved in 'abiotic stress' responses, 'transport' and 'cell organisation and biogenesis', and a down-regulation of transcripts associated with 'electron transport and energy processes'. of the functional genes,  <dig>  were assigned to the group 'response to abiotic or biotic stimulus' and  <dig>  to the category 'response to stress'.

because of their potential importance for crop improvement programs, there is much interest in identifying regulatory genes such as transcription factors  which are responsible for the coordinate regulation of the large gene sets involved in stress response and adaptations. the group of drought-responsive musa transcripts included  <dig> genes  involved in 'transcription' processes. within this group there are  <dig> members  of the ap2/erebp tf family, including two dreb family tfs . members of this family have been implicated both in the regulation of both dehydration and cold stress adaptation  <cit> . additionally there are homologues of  <dig> nac-domain transcription factors , as well as  <dig> bzips,  <dig> bhlhs and  <dig> myb-domain tfs. again, members of these families have all been demonstrated to be involved in dehydration and/or temperature-stress-responsive gene expression and to have binding sites in the promoter region of stress-inducible arabidopsis and/or rice genes - for reviews see  <cit> . in addition, and in common with results from other groups, we also observed the induction of tfs associated with biotic stress responses including for example several up-regulated members of the wrky superfamily  a family of genes known to be involved in the regulation of plant pathogen responses and senescence - for review see  <cit> . the differential regulation of transcripts involved in both biotic and abiotic stress-response pathways is a characteristic of plant  stress responses in part due to the role of stress-hormone signalling in coordinating common, overlapping responses and can lead to the phenomenon of 'cross-tolerance'  <cit> . for example the early gene responses to both drought and salt stress are nearly identical, and members of the dreb tf family are involved in the aba-independent transduction of both drought and cold signals  <cit> .

gos for the list of musa putative drought-responsive genes were also assigned using the genespring gx  <dig>  software , based on affymetrix netaffx annotation , the harvest rice transcript annotations as well as the harvest annotations for the equivalent arabidopsis homologues. from these data, the go classes that were over-represented in response to drought stress relative to the entire genome were identified. from this list of go classes, the expression of genes involved in photosynthesis and phenylpropanoid metabolism were amongst the classes most greatly affected by drought conditions.

visualising cellular responses to drought
to visualize the effects of drought stress in musa on a cellular level, the affymetrix arabidopsis codes for the list of >2-fold differentially expressed homologues on the rice genechip were used to run the 'mapman' software  <cit> . although only  <dig>  of the  <dig>  rice transcripts had an arabidopsis code, the results nonetheless generate an overview of musa cellular responses to drought. as shown in figure  <dig>  the arabidopsis homologues of the drought-responsive sensitive musa transcripts map to a range of pathways and functions consistent with plant abiotic stress responses . these include 'biotic' , 'abiotic stress' , 'hormone response', 'development'  and 'cell wall metabolism'. although these mappings to the pathways are not statistically significant, probably due to the cross-species nature of the analysis, they do indicate the range of processes that may be involved in the response of musa to drought stress.

interestingly only one arabidopsis homologue  was present in the drought/salt-responsive bin. rather, the majority of 'stress-related' transcripts were found in the 'heat', 'biotic stress', and 'development' bins . this again reflects the overlapping and redundant nature of plant responses to water-deficit stress. other functional transcripts of interest were a number of homologues classified in 'redox responses', including for example a cytoplasmic cu-zn sod , known to be up-regulated in response to oxidative stress  <cit> , as well as an up-regulated dehydroascorbate reductase transcript , which is important for the maintenance of l-ascorbate pools, and which again is central to general stress adaptation responses  <cit> . interestingly, two transcripts encoding for a putative trehalose-6-phosphate synthase  were also up-regulated  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold respectively, and tps overexpression has been shown to confer drought tolerance in several plant species  <cit> .

rice drought qtls
to help assess the biological relevance of these results, the list of drought-responsive musa transcripts was compared to the list of genes underlying known qtls for abiotic stresses in rice, obtained from the gramene website . of the  <dig>  differentially regulated musa genes,  <dig> co-localised to a total of  <dig> qtls responsible for either drought or cold-response. these results and the functional annotations of all of the identified putative drought-responsive genes present at each qtl are summarised in table  <dig>

each qtl described by it's gramene website qtl accession id, rice map position and the range of genes underlying that qtl.

interestingly, in two cases the genetic determinants responsible for the qtl phenotype have been linked to a single underlying gene and homologues of these two genes were both present in the list of putative drought-responsive musa transcripts. these two genes are  and  underlying qtls- <dig>  and qtl- <dig>  respectively. loc_os04g <dig> encodes for the protein phot <dig>  which is a membrane-bound protein serine/threonine kinase functioning as a blue light photoreceptor in redundancy with phot <dig>  phot <dig> is responsible for the trait 'drought susceptibility' and was  <dig> -fold up-regulated in response to drought in musa. both phot <dig> and phot <dig> are thought to help optimize photosynthesis by capturing light energy efficiently and by reducing photodamage  <cit> . loc_os11g <dig> encodes for 'aladin', a structural constituent of ribosomes and is identical to the cdna 'huellenlos' . in wheat, the hll homologue appears to be involved in plant development, including development of the floral organs  <cit> .

it is tempting when looking at the list of other drought-responsive genes present at these stress-responsive qtls to try and link gene functions with the overlying trait response, not least because these are potential candidates for explaining the qtl trait, and could therefore be candidates for marker assisted selection programs. of particular interest at qtl- <dig>  are genes encoding for a cyt p <dig> , and a k+ channel, at qtl- <dig> , a myb tf  and chaperonins, while at qtl- <dig>  a bhlh protein, a na/h+ antiporter could clearly have roles in regulating plant drought stress responses. an up-regulated putative carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase  is a member of a gene family believed to be involved in aba synthesis in arabidopsis and which in rice are associated with the negative regulation of the outgrowth of axillary buds  <cit> . clearly such interpretations need to be confirmed through additional experiments including confirmation of gene identities and gene expression analysis. nonetheless it is interesting to note that  <dig> of the transcripts common between transcriptomic studies of rice-seedling dehydration stress , and the musa putative drought stress experiments also colocalize to rice abiotic stress qtls , providing further incidental support for the quality of the data and the annotations generated here.

meta-analyses
to date, the only published comparative gene expression study carried out in banana is the work of santos and co-workers  <cit> , who prepared enriched, full-length cdna libraries from leaves of the cultivar m. acuminata spp. burmannicodes var. calcutta  <dig>  subjected to temperature stress. fortunately however large-scale studies of the response of the transcriptome to abiotic  stress in other plants species are available e.g.  <cit> . of particular interest is the work of tyagi et al  <cit>  who examined the responses of rice to abiotic stresses using the affymetrix rice genome array. in this work, desiccation stress was imposed by drying seedlings between folds of tissue paper for  <dig> h at room temperature. the expression data sets for the results of these studies were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus  database at the ncbi website . this data set contained  <dig>  genes that were significantly  differentially expressed in response to desiccation. despite fundamental differences in the experimental design and in plant developmental status,  <dig> of the rice seedling transcripts overlappedsignificantly  with the list of musa putative drought-responsive genes, including  <dig> that colocalised again with the abiotic stress qtls outlined in table  <dig>  of these  <dig> musa transcripts,  <dig> % were up-regulated and  <dig> % down-regulated .

 <dig> of the  <dig> transcripts could further be assigned an arabdiopsis annotation with the harvest program, and these annotations were again used to assign functional classifications with the go software function on the tair website. these results are summarised in figure 4

looking at the distribution of gene classes we can see that the up-regulated transcripts common to the rice seedling and musa drought-stress experiments, contain proportionally more genes involved in 'transport', 'response to biotic stimulus', 'stress response' and 'transcription', while the classes involved with 'cell biogenesis' and 'electron transport and energy production' are down-regulated. this again agrees with generally-accepted patterns of plant responses to drought/desiccation stress. within the list of functional genes there is an up-regulation of membrane proteins involved in water transport and osmoregulation, as well as proteins for the detoxification of stress-related reactive oxygen species  such as glutathione s-transferases, hydrolase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase etc.. the list of common regulatory genes contains members of the homeodomain proteins , pathogen-induced , myb , erf-family  and one heat stress factor  tf with proposed functions again characteristic of tfs involved in regulating plant biotic stress-responses.

comparison with the results of the atgenexpress
finally, the list of musa putative drought-responsive transcripts was compared to the results obtained from dehydration stress experiments in arabidopsis carried out as part of the atgenexpress consortium  <cit> . in these experiments, dehydration stress was imposed by exposing arabidopsis plants to a dry air stream for  <dig> minutes on the bench until 10% of their fresh weight was lost  <cit> . from the list of  <dig> arabidopsis differentially expressed genes ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  musa gene homologues overlapped with the drought responsive arabidopsis transcripts from shoot and root tissues respectively. in addition there were  <dig> musa transcripts common to all  <dig> data sets . therefore despite substantial differences in experimental design, the results of this meta-analysis indirectly support the provisional gene identities assigned to the drought responsive transcripts in musa and illustrate the degree of conservation of the pathways of plant stress responses across plant species, even when they are as distantly related as arabidopsis and musa.

semiquantitative rt-pcr
the identity of the musa transcripts is based on cross-hybridisation with at least of one  <dig> bp probe per rice genechip® transcript probe-set. to help confirm the validity of the gdna probe-based approach and the identity of the differentially-regulated transcripts, primers were designed to a number of drought-responsive transcripts. to do this we used an in-house, proprietary database of musa unigene sequences. for primer design we preferentially used musa sequences which were 'best hit' in a reciprocal blastn query of rice unigene sequences  versus the musa unigene database. in total, primers to  <dig> sequences were used, and the results from the relative expression levels in control and drought stressed foliar tissue are summarised in figure  <dig> 

as shown in figure  <dig>  the rt-pcr results generally showed the same trends, and expression levels generally agreed well with the results from the microarray hybrisation experiments. this has previously been demonstrated in other heterologous cross-hybridisation experiments utilising more closely-related plant species  <cit> . in this work however there were also several cases where the expected musa relative transcript expression values based on the microarray results significantly differed from the rt-pcr results. these discrepancies probably relate to the difficulty in assigning strict functional annotations and designing primers for  transcripts based on homologies to the relatively short oligonucleotide probes of quite distantly-related heterologous species. in addition, the musa unigene collection we used contains only  <dig>  unique transcript sequences, which extrapolating from the gene densities of one gene per  <dig>  kb reported by lescot et al  <cit>  and a haploid genome size of  <dig> -  <dig> mb  <cit>  corresponds to a maximum of only around 16% of the total predicted number of genes present in the musa genome. this means that in some cases it is possible that the 'true' sequence, with highest homology was simply not present in our unigene collection. in support of this, the sequences that produced relative expression results that were not in agreement with the microarray data generally also had lower e-values, or were transcripts derived from large gene families. undoubtedly the availability of additional est and genome sequence data will improve the reliability of transcript identification.

CONCLUSIONS
despite the economic and social importance of musa spp for large sections of the world's population, there have been few systematic studies into banana and plantain responses to abiotic stress  <cit>  and none to drought. there are also no published genome-wide stress-studies in musa and relatively little sequence data is available particularly when compared to other important crops. further, despite the large number of drought stress-associated genes identified in both model and non-model plant species, there is still no consensus as to the key processes that determine plant tolerance and survival, and in only a few cases has gene function been defined. therefore it is likely that the study of bananas and plantains, will result in the identification of additional, novel stress adaptation mechanisms and could represent a powerful resource in the search for plant stress-tolerant genes and/or markers. the aim of this work therefore was to evaluate the use of a heterologous microarray approach to profile the transcriptome of the relatively drought-tolerant musa cultivar 'cachaco' to chronic drought stress. in contrast to other transcriptomic studies in which short, 'shock-like' treatments have been applied  <cit>  experimental conditions here were chosen to more closely mimic field conditions and thus to identify genes involved in the long-term adaptation and survival of plants to water deficit.

cross-hybridisation of musa gdna to the ath- <dig> and rice genechips® showed that the number of probes and probe-sets retained decreased much more rapidly with increasing cdf-values on the ath- <dig> array than on the rice genechip®. nonetheless there was still a sufficient degree of homology between musa and arabidopsis to be able to profile a significant proportion of the musa expressed genome using the ath- <dig> genechip®. this would thus tend to support the results of comparative sequence studies in musa, oryza and arabidopsis that indicate that poacea and eudicot genomes share microsyntenic regions  <cit> .

cross-hybridisation of musa rna to the rice genechip® identified  <dig>  transcripts  displaying a >2-fold difference in expression levels in response to drought. gene annotations based on rice and arabidopsis databases indicated that many of these transcripts were involved in cellular pathways and processes typically involved in plant biotic stress responses, including a number of genes with tf activity. importantly, our results share significant overlaps with transcriptome studies in other  species, with the list of drought-responsive musa genes including homologues known to be involved in the dehydration stress responses of both rice and arabidopsis. furthermore, the list also contained a number of transcripts that co-localized to known rice qtls for both drought and cold responses, including  <dig> qtls for which the underlying genetic determinant has been localized to a single  gene. these could therefore be a good target for marker development and could directly incorporated into musa breeding and selection programs. these qtl results further suggest that the musa gene annotations and functionalities assigned on the basis of cross-hybridisation to rice probes are correct and have biological significance. this conclusion is further supported by the results of the rt-pcr results, which largely agreed with the expression results derived from the microarray, except for those cases where homology to available musa unigenes was very low or where multiple gene models were available.

therefore cross-species  microarray studies using gdna-based probe selection allows the profiling of up to ~58% of the total musa genome despite the absence of substantial sequence data for this species and the large phylogenetic distance from the target species. this is a substantially larger proportion of the transcriptome than has previously reported for this species and as far as we are aware, the largest phylogenetic distance used in a cross-hybridisation study. gdna probe-based selection thus represents a powerful tool for the study of complex biological responses in a non-model species. while gene ontologies and function of key transcripts have to be carefully validated, the results here underline the potential of this methodology for the identification of  mechanisms and pathways of expression control. in the long term this information can lead to the development of new tools and strategies for the development and breeding of important new crop varieties with improved biotic stress tolerance.
