BACKGROUND
protein turnover is a major determinant in the conversion of feed into growth  <cit> . young and others  <cit>  reported that 15% to 25% of the energy consumed by growing animals is used for protein breakdown and re-synthesis. consequently, minimizing the energetic cost of protein turnover is a strategic goal for enhancing animal growth and feed efficiencies.

protein accretion is the net effect of protein synthesis and degradation. when protein synthesis rates are similar, factors affecting protein degradation are critical in explaining differences in growth efficiency of individuals  <cit> . recently, we showed that fish muscle protein degradation depends on activities of proteolytic enzymes that are tightly controlled and regulated  <cit> . the major systems involved in fish muscle proteolysis are 1) membrane-bound lysosomal enzymes, 2) ubiquitin-proteasome pathway enzymes, and 3) calcium-dependent calpain proteinases.

fish swiftly use proteins as oxidative substrates  <cit>  and proteins have traditionally been considered to be the usual gluconeogenic precursors during starvation in fish  <cit> . rates of protein synthesis also fall during starvation  <cit> . the primary objective of this study was to use microarray technology to identify genes/pathways involved in starvation-related protein turnover. these genes could potentially be used as molecular biomarkers to study protein turnover and select for germplasm with improved protein accretion in rainbow trout .

salmonids during their life cycle may face extended periods without food. fish during starvation depends on body energy reserves. an effective way to identify the relationships between major metabolic pathways and body processes is to examine changes in metabolism during starvation. the secondary objective of this study was to use microarray to identify metabolic adaptations of liver tissue during starvation in rainbow trout.

our microarray experiments showed a synchronized down-regulated expression of protein biosynthesis genes in starved fish but no significant changes of gene expression in the major protein catabolic pathways were observed. to further investigate the effect of starvation on protein degradation, we used real-time pcr and enzyme activity assays  to measure the expression of genes and enzyme activities in the major proteolytic systems. our results suggest a significant role of calpain and 20s proteasome pathways in rainbow trout protein turnover under fasting condition.

RESULTS
we performed microarray experiments to evaluate the changes in hepatic gene expression in response to starvation in rainbow trout. microarray analysis defined  <dig> down-regulated and  <dig> up-regulated unique transcripts in starved fish . expression of  <dig> randomly selected genes, identified by microarray as differentially expressed, was confirmed by quantitative real time pcr analysis , indicating the reliability of the microarray data. the expression trends of all  <dig> genes were similar in both microarray and real-time pcr analyses. the differentially expressed genes were classified according to the go biological functions .

protein biosynthesis
our microarray data showed that 28% of the differentially expressed genes belong to the protein biosynthesis machinery . almost all the protein biosynthesis genes were down-regulated . the list includes  <dig> cytoplasmic ribosomal protein genes  and  <dig> mitochondrial ribosomal protein genes . ribosomal proteins are essential for mrna translation into protein  <cit> , and they are integral components of the ribosome. ribosomal proteins stabilize the rrna structure and regulate translocation of mrna and trna, which is necessary for optimal translation  <cit> . the down-regulated expression of the ribosomal proteins in starved fish suggests a well-regulated decrease in rate of protein synthesis at transcription. control of gene expression at transcription would allow rapid suppression of protein biosynthesis when amino acids are deficient.

starved fish exhibited up-regulated expression of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2c,  <dig>  and s <dig>  translation initiation factors are essential for protein synthesis  <cit> . a similar eukaryotic translation initiation factor  is a highly conserved adaptor to stress  <cit> . the upregulated expression of the eukaryotic translation initiation factors may be to keep the basal level of protein translation or as a consequence of starvation stress. on the other hand, the eukaryotic translation elongation factors  <dig> alpha, eef1a <dig>  and beta, eef1b <dig>  were down-regulated. jurss and coworkers  <cit>  reported that rainbow trout in vitro protein synthesis-stimulating activity is reduced by food deprivation and can be compensated by addition of elongation factors ef <dig> and/or ef <dig>  consequently, availability of eukaryotic translation factors, ef <dig> and ef <dig>  may be a rate-determining point for rainbow trout protein synthesis. in addition, the biotinidase transcript, which catalyzes the release of biotin from biocytin, was also down regulated in starved fish. theoretically, formation of translation initiation complexes may depend on biotin  <cit> . expression of the peptidyl-prolyl, cis-trans, isomerase a  declined in starved fish. this enzyme is ubiquitous and encodes essential step in protein folding and post-translational modification. in addition, the beta subunit of sec <dig> protein, which is involved in the co-translational protein transport system  <cit> , was down-regulated in starved fish suggesting impaired intracellular protein transport.

tripathi and verma  <cit>  reported a reduction in an overall capacity for protein synthesis in starved catfish. peragon and colleagues  <cit>  found that, during starvation, total hepatic-protein and rna contents decreased significantly, and the absolute protein-synthesis rate also fell. pace and manahan  <cit>  reported that protein synthesis accounted for 16± 4% and 75± 11% of metabolism in unfed and fed sea urchin larvae, respectively. protein synthesis accounts for a high percentage of the individual's metabolic costs. consequently, regulation of protein synthesis is a promising means to limit energy expenditures under unfavorable feeding condition. these reports are consistent with our results showing highly regulated protein synthesis rates in fish liver in response to starvation. less essential pathways such as protein synthesis are reduced to minimize atp demands  <cit> .

mitochondrial functions and glucose metabolism
several genes belonging to complexes of the mitochondrial electron transport pathway were down-regulated. these genes include complex iii , complex iv  and complex v atp synthase . in addition, succinyl-coa synthetase alpha subunit of the citric acid cycle was down-regulated in starved fish. furthermore, several members of the adenine nucleotide translocator that transports atp out of the mitochondrion matrix in exchange for adp produced in the cytosol were down-regulated. similarly, a mitochondrial phosphate carrier, which returns phosphate generated by atp breakdown to the mitochondrion, was down-regulated. an outer mitochondrial membrane translocase, tomm <dig>  which mediates the translocation of preproteins into or across the outer mitochondrial membrane, was down-regulated in starved fish. conversely, tomm <dig> was up-regulated. the vast majority of mitochondrial proteins are synthesized from nuclear dna as precursor proteins on cytosolic polysomes, and these proteins must be imported into the mitochondria  <cit> . our results point to impaired mitochondrial functions and an overall reduction in atp production capacity as a result of starvation. maintenance of high metabolic rates following the exhaustion of energy reserves during starvation would compromise animals' ability to survive  <cit> .

on the other hand, energy production through anaerobic mechanisms seems to be less sensitive than aerobic  mechanisms in responding to an inadequate supply of energetic compounds from food sources. starvation caused a decreased expression of a single glycolytic pathway enzyme; gapdh. surprisingly, other members of the glycolytic pathway, including the highly regulated and rate-limiting enzymes, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase were not affected . moreover, expression of ribose 5-phosphate isomerase a, a member of the pentose phosphate pathway that is responsible for 30% of the hepatic glucose oxidation  <cit> , was up-regulated in starved fish. the lack of a coordinated, down-regulated expression of the glycolytic pathway enzymes upon starvation support the notion of altered regulation for carbohydrate metabolism in carnivorous fish such as rainbow trout as compared to mammals  <cit> . to explain the low dietary glucose utilization in rainbow trout, wilson  <cit>  hypothesized the existence of dysfunctional regulation of hepatic glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. no dietary requirement for carbohydrate has been demonstrated in fish. when carbohydrates are not provided in the diet, other nutrients such as protein and lipids are catabolized for energy  <cit> . the stabilized expression of most glycolytic pathway enzymes may be to preserve the enzymatic machinery of the gluconeogenesis. while the activities of most pathways are reduced during starvation, some pathways, such as gluconeogenesis, may remain unaltered or become enhanced  <cit>  in vital tissues during the initial stages of fish starvation. glucose is needed for the continued function of essential organs like brain. another explanation for the maintenance of glycolytic enzymes' expression is short duration of feed deprivation  used in this experiment.

the antioxidant systems
in starved fish, reduced expression of a number of transcripts related to maintenance of intracellular redox status was observed. these transcripts include  <dig> glutathione s-transferase  transcripts and the glutathione peroxidase  gene . these genes encode for antioxidants required to defend against reactive oxygen species  generated during the aerobic metabolic activities. gpx breaks down hydrogen peroxide  <cit>  and gst conjugates reduced glutathione to xenobiotics or cellular components damaged by ros  <cit> . another down-regulated transcript is hydroxyacid oxidase  whose expression has been shown to be liver-specific and targeted to peroxisomes. hao <dig> belongs to a family of enzymes that convert a broad range of α-hydroxy acids to α-keto acids and concomitantly reduce molecular oxygen to h2o <dig>  <cit> . oxidative activities of mitochondria are a primary endogenous source of the reactive oxygen species . consequently, we predict that, as the rate of ros generation is decreased as a result of reduced aerobic metabolism in starved fish, the rate of the cellular antioxidants generation is decreased as well.

several members of the antioxidant systems that keep intracellular redox homeostasis including thioredoxin, glutaredoxin-like transcripts and disulfide reductases exhibited decreased expression in starved fish . jimenez and coworkers  <cit>  reported that glucose deprivation reduced levels of thioredoxin-like protein. conversely, its over-expression protects against glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity. consequently, our results support the assertion that thioredoxin might be involved in cellular response to starvation stress.

lipid and prostaglandin metabolism
fish use lipids as the major energy source in contrast to mammals that depend primarily on carbohydrates  <cit> . microarray analysis revealed a decreased mrna accumulation of the apolipoproteins including apob, apoa <dig>  apoc <dig>  apoc <dig>  apoe, and apoh in starved fish . apolipoproteins are plasma lipoprotein complexes that are synthesized mainly in the liver, bind to lipids, and transport them to different tissues through circulation  <cit> .

starved fish showed reduced mrna accumulation of the fatty acid binding proteins, fabp <dig> and fabp <dig> and the retinol binding proteins, rbp <dig> and rbp <dig> . fabps and rbps are collectively referred to as the intracellular lipid binding proteins. rbps bind retinoids, which are essential for growth, vision, reproduction, hematopoiesis and immune function. fabps play an important role in the intracellular uptake and transport of long-chain fatty acids through the aqueous cytoplasm to the site of their oxidation in the mitochondria or peroxisomes  <cit> . fabps concentration increases with treatments that increase fatty acid metabolism, and it is positively correlated with the ability of tissues to metabolize fat  <cit> . down-regulated expression of fabps suggests reduced hepatic fatty acid metabolism that may contribute to the aforementioned overall decrease in mitochondrial atp production in starved fish.

the microarray data did not reveal any elevated expression of the liver fatty acid oxidation mechanisms in starved fish suggesting that rainbow trout may mobilize fat from extra-hepatic resources to fuel metabolism during feed deprivation. jeziersk and colleagues  <cit>  reported that upon starvation, visceral lipid contributed the most to energy metabolism compared to muscle and liver fat depots. the absolute amount of fat derived from the liver was much smaller than that of muscle and viscera. rasmussen and coworkers  <cit>  reported that a 50% increase in feed lipid content enhanced fillet lipid levels by 20% and caused a 15–20% increase in the visceral fraction. our previous results, using microarray and proximate analyses, did not reveal any significant modification of the lipolysis pathways in atrophying rainbow trout muscle  <cit> . collectively, our results indicate that visceral fat is the first to be mobilized and perhaps the most important fat depot for energy in rainbow trout  <cit> . liver and muscle lipids may be less mobile than visceral lipid. detailed studies are needed to explore different mechanisms that regulate lipid mobilization from visceral, liver and muscle stores.

a significant decrease in mrna accumulation of the fatty acid desaturase  <dig> gene  was observed in starved fish . fads <dig> is a terminal component of the liver lipogenic microsomal stearyl-coa desaturase system that uses o and electrons from reduced cytochrome b <dig> to catalyze the insertion of a double bond into a spectrum of fatty acyl-coa substrates, including palmitoyl-coa and stearoyl-coa. the closely related desaturase, fads <dig>  is a key regulatory enzyme of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis  <cit> . jezierska and coworkers  <cit>  reported a decline in the hepatic percentage of the monoenoic fatty acid upon starvation of rainbow trout; whereas, the saturates remained relatively constant and polyunsaturates increased. smith and colleagues  <cit>  reported that monounsaturated fatty acids, 16:1n- <dig>  18:1n- <dig> and 18:1n- <dig>  of the spiny lobster, jasus edwardsii decreased with starvation. these results indicate diet-dependent adaptive shifts in fish relative fatty acid composition. unsaturated fatty acids are needed for their unique physical properties in biological membranes  <cit> . nevertheless, unsaturated fatty acids are synthesized at considerable energetic cost; approximately  <dig> atp are used for each desaturation and 2-carbon elongation. consequently, it may be advantageous to delay synthesizing these costly molecules until feeding is resumed.

starved fish exhibited reduced mrna accumulation of prostaglandin d <dig> synthase  <dig> . ptgds <dig> is the precursor of 15-deoxy-delta12-14-prostaglandin j <dig>  that plays a critical role in fat cell differentiation, inducing the expression of adipocyte-specific genes and promoting the formation of mature, lipid-laden adipocytes  <cit> . in addition, adipose differentiation-related protein  expression was reduced in starved fish. adfp is associated with early stages of adipocyte differentiation and may play a critical role in regulating the formation, turnover and metabolic consequences of fat formation in mammalian extra adipose tissues  <cit> . collectively, gene expression data, relative to lipid metabolism, suggest that the need to reduce metabolic energy costs has slowed down mechanisms of lipid and fatty acid synthesis, lipid binding and transportation and adipocyte differentiation. more detailed investigations on fish may add new insights into the molecular evolution of the mechanisms regulating lipogenesis and lipolysis processes and should become the objective of further studies.

blood function
starvation reduced expression of many iron homeostasis and blood function-related genes including oxygen carrier hemoglobin , alpha and beta; plasma iron transport protein, transferrin; and the iron storing protein, ferritin . heme binding protein  <dig> was up-regulated in starved fish. transcripts of blood coagulation proteins, fibrinogen, plasminogen, thrombin receptor, and antithrombin  were down-regulated in starved fish. haptoglobin, which binds free hb leaking from red blood cells under pathological conditions to protect against its harmful oxidative effects  <cit> , was also down regulated. in addition, the important cardiovascular and body fluid homeostasis gene, natriuretic peptide precursor a  <cit>  was down-regulated in starved fish. collectively, these data suggest that iron homeostasis functions are compromised in starved fish. head kidney is the main hematopoietic tissue in fish  <cit> , however, liver is a highly vascularized tissue. consequently, the contradictory expression of the liver iron homeostasis transcripts may be due to the red blood cells entering the liver.

immune response
several immune-relevant genes were down-regulated in response to starvation . the list includes  <dig> components of the complement system, c <dig>  c <dig>  cfb and cfp;  <dig> transcripts of c-type lectins, and the aforementioned transferrin, prostaglandin d <dig> synthase, glutathione peroxidases and hepatoglobin genes. these transcripts were identified by cdna subtractive libraries as liver-made defense molecules and members of the fish innate immune system. these genes are inducible when fish are challenged with bacterial infection  <cit> . furthermore, hepcidin, a potent antimicrobial peptide and important member of the fish innate immune system  <cit> , was down-regulated, and transferrin, which is a positive acute phase protein in rainbow trout  <cit>  was also down-regulated in starved fish. transferrin, ferritin and hepcidin modulate iron homeostasis  <cit> ; hence, they may control bacterial proliferation by limiting iron availability  <cit> . down-regulation of the immune-relevant genes suggests mechanisms by which starved fish may demonstrate weakened pathogen resistance.

on the other hand, few immune-relevant genes showed up-regulated expression in response to starvation . two transcripts belonging to the t cell receptor system that is involved in adaptive  immune responses  <cit>  were up-regulated. in addition, starved fish exhibited increased expression of the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase  gene. macrophages from mice over expressing acp <dig> showed increased capacity for killing bacteria  <cit> . lymphoid cells entering liver from circulation may be responsible for this change.

the immune response includes synthesis of potent antioxidants to protect cells against oxidative damage  <cit> . starved fish exhibited reduced expression of several genes involved in managing oxidative stress, including glutathione s-transferases and glutathione peroxidases. these genes were consistently up-regulated in piscirickettsia salmonis-infected macrophages of atlantic salmon  <cit> . on the other hand, cytochrome p <dig> cyp1a <dig> and cyp3a <dig>  which are components of the necessary detoxification pathway  <cit> , were up-regulated in starved fish.

miscellaneous functions
starved fish showed down-regulation of many transcripts classified into various functions including transcriptional housekeeping genes, transcription factors and regulators and genes belonging to several signal transduction pathways. a complete list of the differentially expressed genes is available at ncbi gene expression omnibus  database with the accession number: gse <dig>  <cit> .

proteolysis and amino acid metabolism
fish swiftly use proteins as oxidative substrates  <cit> . protein turnover is a crucial determinant in converting feed into growth  <cit> . during starvation, fractional protein-degradation rate increases significantly  <cit> . protein degradation is a tightly controlled and regulated process that depends on at least three major proteolytic enzyme pathways  <cit> . consequently, gene expression of these enzyme systems is expected to increase in starved fish. however, starved fish showed reduced expression of a number of transcripts related to amino acid and proteolysis functions . two proteasome and  <dig> ubiquitin transcripts were also down-regulated in starved fish.

evaluation of protease gene expression using real-time pcr and enzyme activity assays
since the microarray approach did not show significant changes of gene expression in protein catabolic pathways, we decided to use real-time pcr and the enzyme activity assays to measure the expression of genes and enzyme activities in the major proteolytic systems.

as shown in fig.  <dig>  starvation did not affect the mrna levels for capn <dig>  capn <dig>  cpns and cast-s . however, a significant decrease in cast-l expression , with a corresponding increase in the calpain catalytic activity, was observed in starved fish . our results are consistent with a previous report showing that during starvation, activity of the calpain system in bovine skeletal muscle is controlled through decrease in expression of cast  <cit> .

cast is a specific and the only known endogenous inhibitor of the calpain system. mammalian experiments showed that β-adrenergic agonist administration decreases protein degradation through increased expression of the cast gene  <cit> . cast is associated with the muscle fractional degradation rate  <cit>  and reduced muscle wastage in experimental animals  <cit> . studies on the importance of cast gene in fish are still limited. previously, we reported that calpains play an important role in muscle proteolysis fueling metabolism of rainbow trout during starvation  <cit> . in addition, cast-l and cast-s mrna were positively associated with muscle growth and firmness in rainbow trout  <cit> . the present results indicate that the calpain pathway may be involved in mobilizing hepatic proteins during starvation. the current study supports the importance of cast gene in controlling fish protein turnover, and suggests that cast-l may be a good candidate as a biomarker for fish protein accretion. data collected recently in our lab indicated that the cast-l and cast-s genes are polymorphic in rainbow trout strains/crosses . more detailed studies to determine the physiological roles of cast and the association of its polymorphisms with economically important traits in farmed fish are needed and are being currently conducted in our lab.

real time pcr analyses revealed no significant difference in expression of any of the studied proteasome genes including subunit alpha  <dig>  subunit beta  <dig>  the regulatory subunit  <dig>  subunit n <dig> and poly-ubiquitin . unexpectedly, the corresponding 20s proteasome activity was slightly but significantly higher in starved fish , suggesting a post-transcriptional regulatory effect of starvation on proteasome enzymatic activity. the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is primarily responsible for proteolysis of normal mammalian muscle  <cit> . however, studies on fish indicate that the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway is down-regulated in liver and muscle of starved rainbow trout without affecting mrna of the proteasome n <dig>  <cit> . our previous studies showed that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is not up-regulated during spawning-induced muscle proteolysis in rainbow trout  <cit> . dobly and coworkers reported that proteasome activity in liver, but not in muscle, was negatively correlated with growth rates in rainbow trout  <cit> . these contradicting results suggest that our current observation of increased proteasome activity may represent a temporal change. additional studies are needed to characterize the role of the proteasome system in fish protein accretion.

the mrna abundance for cathepsins d and l and their corresponding enzyme activities were not affected by starvation as shown in fig.  <dig> . our previous reports indicated that lysosomal cathepsins, particularly cathepsin-l, are the key proteases in spawning-induced proteolysis in rainbow trout  <cit> . in addition, we reported that β-adrenergic agonist administration reduced rainbow trout muscle cathepsin d activity  <cit> . the cathepsin pathway appears to play a major role in mobilizing muscle protein in salmonids, particularly when they cease feeding during their prolonged spawning migration  <cit> . guderley found that, in atlantic cod, hepatic contents of lysosomal proteases decreased with prolonged starvation, whereas in white muscle, starvation doubled specific activity of cathepsin d  <cit> . these results indicate that cathepsins may be less important in mobilizing hepatic proteins than in muscular proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
the major responses of rainbow trout liver to starvation are: 1) a generalized decline in gene expression associated with a decrease in tissue metabolism, 2) an overall reduction in protein synthetic capacity, 3) impairment of mitochondrial  atp-biosynthetic functions while maintaining liver glycolytic/gluconeogenic competence, 4) down-regulated expression in mechanisms associated with hepatic lipid and fatty acid transport while maintaining fatty acid oxidation mechanisms, 5) significant increases in calpain and proteasome catabolic pathways, 6) fish may maintain tight-control on the mechanisms of protein metabolism more than lipid or carbohydrate under short term starvation condition and 7) extra-hepatic tissues, especially visceral fat, may play a major role in lipid metabolism upon starvation.

maintenance of glycolytic expression may represent a short term effect  and suggest that normal turnover of energy reserves may be sufficient to maintain energy requirements during the initial stages of food deprivation. nevertheless, the overall decrease of expression is indicative of a long-term metabolic response that aims to conserve energy reserves and enhance the ability to survive until feed is available. the use of microarray approach and enzyme activity measurements has allowed us to follow more closely the metabolic changes occurring during starvation. more detailed work is necessary to identify specific steps that control individual metabolic pathways and thereby determine energy use during starvation. the cast-l gene is an appealing candidate as a potential biomarker for fish protein accretion. more detailed studies are needed to explore the physiological roles of the cast-l gene in fish growth.
