BACKGROUND
copper-dependent lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases  are important enzymes for degradation of biological macromolecules such as plant cell wall and chitin polymers  <cit> . the lpmos are metalloenzymes that oxidize the glycosidic bonds in cellulose  <cit> , hemicellulose  <cit>  and chitin  <cit> . the catalysis involves binding of an active oxygen molecule to the copper atom  <cit>  and interaction of a large surface of the lpmo with several chains of the crystalline polysaccharide substrate  <cit> . it was hypothesized that lpmos could only act on crystalline substrates but recently it was found that some lpmos oxidize soluble short-chain polysaccharides hence expanding the known lpmo substrates to soluble polymers  <cit> .

the lpmos were originally classified as glycoside hydrolases  and carbohydrate-binding modules  but are now placed in the auxiliary activity families aa <dig>  aa <dig> and aa <dig> in the cazy database  <cit> .

family aa <dig> include fungal enzymes formerly classified in the gh <dig> family. their classification as ghs was based on the report that one of the gh61s has weak endocellulase activity  <cit> . furthermore, certain aa <dig> family members enhance enzymatic degradation of cellulose  <cit>  and are important industrial enzymes for conversion of lignocellulotic biomass into soluble sugars.

the enzymatically characterized aa <dig> proteins oxidise the glycosidic bonds in cellulose  <cit>  but less than ten of the more than  <dig> aa <dig> proteins in the cazy database  have been investigated. furthermore, based on the large sequence diversity of the aa <dig> proteins it has been suggested that some aa9s may oxidize other substrates than cellulose  <cit> . this hypothesis is supported by a recent report of an aa <dig> protein that degrades hemicellulose  <cit>  and different substrates induce expression of different aa <dig> genes  <cit> . moreover, some fungi possess more than  <dig> different aa9-encoding genes in their genomes  <cit> , which seems to be an excessive number of lpmos for degradation of just one substrate.

in this context it is interesting that some of the bacterial lpmos in the aa <dig> family degrade chitin whereas other degrade cellulose  <cit> . in addition, the substrate for the only characterized enzymes of the other type of fungal lpmos, the aa <dig> proteins, is chitin  <cit> . the aa <dig> lpmos were originally classified as a subfamily of the gh <dig> proteins  <cit>  but later renamed as aa <dig>  however, only a few of these proteins have been annotated and only a single one is functionally characterized  <cit> .

peptide pattern recognition  is a new approach for sequence analysis. it was used to classify  <dig> gh61-like proteins and pinpoint conserved amino acid residues in their sequences  <cit> . moreover, ppr was used to annotate all ghs and lpmos in  <dig> fungal genomes  <cit> . however, only lpmos similar to the sequences found in cazy were annotated. to further investigate the large number of fungal lpmos of the aa <dig> and aa <dig> families and the high sequence diversity we have used ppr to divide  <dig> lpmos found in cazy and additional  <dig> lpmo-like proteins found by blast search in genbank into subfamilies. each of the three families aa <dig>  aa <dig> and aa <dig> were characterized by a non-overlapping set of conserved peptides that mapped to similar regions in the lpmo proteins. the conserved sequences were used to annotate the lpmos in  <dig> fungal and  <dig> bacterial genomes. aa <dig> and aa <dig> were exclusively found in fungal genomes whereas aa10s were found in bacteria and a single aa10-encoding gene was found in each of two fungi. furthermore, aa9s were more abundant in plant cell wall-degrading fungi in agreement with that the substrates for aa <dig> enzymes are cellulose and hemicellulose. in contrast, aa11-encoding genes were found in all the ascomycetes examined, except for three saccharomycetes with different life styles, but only in a few of the white and brown rot basidiomycetes and the number of genes did not correlate to the degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose.

RESULTS
division of large families of cazyme proteins like the gh <dig> and gh <dig> into subfamilies has proven to be an important tool for characterization of the families  <cit> . to obtain subfamilies of the lpmos  <dig> aa <dig>   <dig> aa <dig> and  <dig> aa <dig> unique protein sequences were downloaded from genbank. furthermore,  <dig> gh <dig> subfamily  <dig> proteins  <cit>  were pooled with the aa <dig> sequences yielding a total of  <dig> unique aa11/gh <dig> subfamily  <dig> sequences after removal of duplicates. ppr analysis of the proteins after removal of duplicates and of irrelevant protein domains generated  <dig> subfamilies of aa <dig> proteins,  <dig> subfamilies of aa <dig> proteins and  <dig> subfamilies of aa <dig> proteins .

due to the careful curation of sequences in cazy  <cit>  this database may not contain all sequences relevant for sequence analysis of the lpmos  <cit> . therefore, we used blastp search to find the  <dig> sequences with the highest sequence similarity to the sequence with highest score in each of the lpmo subfamilies. these sequences were curated by removal of duplicates and irrelevant proteins domains and all sequences recognized as aa <dig> by ppr from the list of aa11-like sequences and vice versa . a procedure of removing irrelevant protein domains rather than relying on positive identification of lpmo-relevant domains by cdd search was used to include putative lpmos that might not contain a domain recognized by the cdd . although this approach increases the risk of including non-lpmo proteins in the analysis we have previously found that ppr analysis separates unrelated proteins into different subfamilies  <cit> . hence, these subfamilies may be removed after ppr analysis by manual curation.

the expanded lpmo families consisted of  <dig> aa9-like proteins ,  <dig> aa10-like proteins  and  <dig> aa11-like proteins , respectively. this represents an additional  <dig> aa9-like proteins,  <dig> aa10-like proteins and  <dig> aa11-like proteins.

ppr divided the aa9exp proteins into  <dig> subfamilies . comparison of the conserved peptides between subfamilies showed that the aa9exp subfamilies shared from  <dig> to  <dig> conserved peptides . interestingly, of the eight enzymatically characterized aa9s three are classified in the related subfamilies  <dig> and  <dig>  two in subfamily  <dig>  two in the related subfamilies  <dig> and  <dig> and the last one in subfamily  <dig> . thus no aa9s from a large group of subfamilies  have been characterized although they are distantly related to the other subfamilies.figure  <dig> cluster analysis of the  <dig> aa9exp subfamilies. cluster analysis based on the number of shared hexapeptides between each subfamily. the subfamilies that included aa <dig> proteins designated as enzymatically characterized in the cazy database are indicated. subfamilies containing c1-oxidizing lpmos are indicated with a circle and c4-oxidizing lpmos with a square. subfamilies containing lpmos that are both c1- and c4- oxidizing or with unknow mechanism are indicated with a diamond. the symbol around subfamilies with cellulose-oxidizing members is red and the symbol around subfamily  <dig> which contains a cellulose- and hemicellulose-oxidizing member is purple. cluster analysis was performed as described in methods.



to make sure that all relevant aa10-like proteins were included in the expanded aa <dig> family less stringent criteria were used to exclude protein domains from the sequences of the aa10-like proteins . as a result of this  <dig> of the  <dig> subfamilies of the aa10exp proteins generated by ppr contained proteins that were identified as not being lpmos, not including a gh <dig> or chitin-binding domain as accessed by cdd search. after removal of these irrelevant subfamilies, there were  <dig> subfamilies of aa <dig> proteins  that shared  <dig> –  <dig> conserved peptides . the enzymatically characterized aa10s were classified to subfamilies that are relatively well distributed in the cluster analysis . interestingly, the three aa10s that oxidize cellulose belong to subfamilies  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> that cluster close together. thus the aa <dig> subfamily division does correlate to enzyme substrate to a certain extent although subfamily  <dig> also contains a chitin-degrading aa <dig> figure  <dig> cluster analysis of the  <dig> aa10exp subfamilies. cluster analysis based on the number of shared hexapeptides between each subfamily. the subfamilies that included aa <dig> proteins designated as enzymatically characterized in the cazy database are indicated with the same symbols as in figure  <dig>  the symbol around subfamilies with cellulose-oxidizing members is red and the symbol around subfamilies with chitin-oxidizing members is blue. subfamily  <dig> is indicated in purple as it contains members oxidizing both cellulose and chitin cluster analysis was performed as described in methods.



ppr analysis divided the aa11exp proteins into  <dig> subfamilies . seven of the subfamilies were closely related and share up to  <dig> conserved peptides . the only characterized aa <dig> is classified to one of these subfamilies. . the last four subfamilies only shared few peptides with the other subfamilies .figure  <dig> cluster analysis of the  <dig> aa11exp subfamilies. cluster analysis based on the number of shared hexapeptides between each subfamily. subfamily  <dig> that included the aa <dig> protein designated as enzymatically characterized in the cazy database is indicated with the same symbol as in figure  <dig>  the symbol is blue to indicate the the characterized enzyme oxidizes chitin. cluster analysis was performed as described in methods.



no peptides were shared between any of the aa9exp subfamilies and the aa10exp subfamilies or the aa11exp subfamilies or between any of the aa10exp subfamilies and the aa11exp subfamilies. hence, the three families of lpmos can be clearly separated based on their conserved peptides. nevertheless, the distribution of conserved peptides on the lpmos identifies a highly conserved region around amino acids  <dig> –  <dig> ,  <dig> –  <dig>  and  <dig> –  <dig>  . furthermore, the aa9s and aa11s have another conserved region around amino acids  <dig> –  <dig>  this conserved region is located a little differently in the aa10s around amino acids  <dig> –  <dig> . very few conserved peptides were identified after amino acid  <dig> in all three families.figure  <dig> distribution of the conserved hexapeptides in the lpmo sequences. the distribution of hexapeptides for each subfamily was calculated as the number of hexapeptides mapping to each  <dig> amino acids interval as described in methods. the accumulated hexapeptide frequency  was calculated as the sum of the distribution of all the subfamilies in each  <dig> amino acids interval. the horizontal axis designates the amino acid intervals. a: aa9exp. b: aa10exp. c: aa11exp.



mapping of the conserved residues onto the 3d-structure of an lpmo belonging to each family showed that the conserved region extends through the center of the proteins and protrudes on both sides of the structure . hence a large part of the conserved region is buried inside the proteins as previously reported  <cit> . the 3d structures used were lpmo proteins from thermoascus aurantiacus  <cit>  belonging to aa <dig> subfamily  <dig>  bacillus amyloliquefaciens  <cit>  belonging to aa <dig> subfamily  <dig> and aspergillus oryzae  <cit>  belonging to aa <dig> subfamily  <dig> figure  <dig> mapping of conserved peptides in aa <dig>  aa <dig> and aa <dig> on 3d proteins structures. conserved peptides from aa <dig> subfamily  <dig> was mapped onto the structure  of t. aurantiacus aa <dig>  <cit>  belonging to subfamily  <dig>  conserved peptides from aa <dig> subfamily  <dig> was mapped onto the structure  of b. amyloliquefaciens aa <dig>  <cit>  belonging to aa <dig> subfamily  <dig>  conserved peptides from aa <dig> subfamily  <dig> was mapped onto the structure  of a. oryzae aa <dig>  <cit>  belonging to aa <dig> subfamily  <dig>  the regions including conserved peptides are indicated in yellow. for t. aurantiacus aa <dig>  <cit>  the conserved regions are amino acids 102- <dig>  131- <dig>  171- <dig> and 192- <dig>  for b. amyloliquefaciens aa <dig>  <cit>  the conserved regions are amino acids 60- <dig>  80- <dig>  171- <dig> and 194- <dig>  for a. oryzae aa <dig>  <cit>  the conserved regions are amino acids 42- <dig>  75- <dig>  143- <dig> and 190- <dig>  amino acid side chains are shown as thin strings. alpha-helixes are indicated as tubes and beta-sheets are indicated by flat arrows.



we have previously shown that the conserved peptides identified by ppr in lpmos are useful for design of degenerate primers for pcr amplification of related genes  <cit> . moreover, by searching in proteins sequences for homology to peptide patterns , it can be investigated whether a protein sequence contains a sufficient number of conserved peptides from a specific ppr-generated lpmo subfamily to be identified as an lpmo and member of this subfamily  <cit> . this is a kind of in silico pcr with degenerated primers.

to test whether the conserved peptides can be used not only to annotate lpmos but also to distinguish between the three different lpmo families we used hotpep to annotate the aa <dig>  aa <dig> and aa <dig> proteins in cazy with the conserved peptides for the lpmo families. hotpep annotated between  <dig> and 100% of the aa <dig>  aa <dig> and aa <dig> proteins to the correct family and none of the proteins were falsely annotated . for the aa9exp, aa10exp and aa11exp the annotation rate was lower. however, most of the unannotated proteins were suspected not to be lpmos. only 3% of the unannotated aa9exp sequences, 4% of the unannotated aa10exp sequences and 2% of the unannotated aa11exp sequences included a gh <dig>  or chitin-binding domain  as accessed by cdd search. after removal of the proteins without a domain clearly associated to lpmos from the sequence list, the annotation rate increased to 96% , 94%  and 98% . these data indicate that the peptide patterns generated for the three lpmo families were able to recognize the vast majority of the lpmos without false annotation of unrelated sequences.table  <dig>

to investigate the potential of different fungi for expression of lpmos we used hotpep  <cit>  to mine  <dig> fungal genomes for lpmo-encoding genes. this was done by dividing the contigs of each genome into  <dig> nucleotides long fragments and search for conserved peptides from each subfamily of the aa9exp, aa10exp and aa11exp families in all six reading frames. all reading frames that satisfied the threshold conditions  were considered as hits.

for  <dig> of the fungal genomes the lpmos have previously been annotated based on similarity to the lpmos found in cazy  <cit> . this analysis identified  <dig> lpmos in the  <dig> genomes. however, by using the expanded lpmo families, a total of  <dig> lpmos were found in the same  <dig> genomes.

for all of the  <dig> fungal genomes aa9-encoding genes were found in the ascomycetes and the basidiomycetes but not in the three other fungal phyla whereas aa11-encoding genes were only found in the ascomycetes and in three of the basidiomycetes . the fungi were designated as plant cell wall-degrading and non-degraders based on whether they have been reported to degrade major components  of natural plant cell wall material as previously described  <cit> . according to this definition, the brown and white rot basidiomycetes and saprophytic fungi are designated as lignocellulose degraders whereas zygomycetes and chytridiomycetes that are able to degrade pure cellulose in the laboratory but have not been reported to decompose natural lignocellulotic compounds in nature are designated as non-degraders  <cit> . the plant cell wall-degrading fungi of all phyla had an average of ten aa9-encoding genes although there were large variations from a few genes in talaromyces and trichoderma spp. and brown rot fungi to  <dig> aa <dig> genes in chaetomium globosum. there were more aa <dig> belonging to some subfamilies, most notably subfamilies  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in the plant cell wall-degraders than in the other ascomycetes and basidiomycetes . moreover, no aa <dig> lpmos were found in any of the eight dermatophytes arthroderma gypseum, arthroderma otae, candida albicans, coccidioides immitis, coccidioides posadasii, trichophyton rubrum, trichophyton tonsurans and trichophyton verrucosumor in the two insect pathogens cordyceps militaris and metarhizium anisopliae.table  <dig>

the number of aa11-encoding genes in the fungal genomes did not correlate to the capacity of the fungi to degrade cellulose and hemicellulose . as the aa11-encoding genes were only found in the genomes of the ascomycetes we investigated whether there was a correlation between aa <dig> subfamilies and the life style of the acomycetes. subfamilies 4- and 7-encoding genes were found in more than half of the plant cell wall degraders but not in any of the non-degraders . although these subfamilies clustered close to subfamily  <dig>  that was more abundant in non-degraders than in plant cell wall-degraders the result suggests that aa <dig> lpmos belonging to subfamilies  <dig> and  <dig> may be related to plant cell wall degradation. next, the subfamily distribution of the aa11-encoding genes in the dermatophytes was compared to the genes in the seven non-dermatophytic ascomycetes botryotinia fuckeliana, ceratocystis fimbriata, saccharomyces cerevisiae, uncinocarpus reesii, wickerhamomyces anomalus, daldinia eschscholzii and bipolaris maydis. this showed that that the dermatophytic ascomycetes had on average more than three times as many aa <dig> subfamily 1-encoding genes than the non-dermatophytic ascomycetes . therefore, some aa <dig> lpmos may be involved in degradation of the keratinized skin components that dermatophytes use as nutrient  <cit> . on the other hand, aa <dig> subfamily  <dig> was found in the genomes of the endophytic ascomycetes d. eschscholzii  <cit>  and ascocoryne sarcoides  <cit>  and the white rot-causing basidiomycete schizophyllum commune  <cit>  .figure  <dig> distribution of genes for each aa <dig> subfamily in the genomes of ascomycetes. the number of genes encoding proteins belonging to each aa <dig> subfamily was counted for each genome. a. plant cell wall-degraders are indicated by “yes” and non-degraders are indicated by “no”. b. dermatophytes are indicated by “dermatophyte” and non-invaders are indicated by “other ascomycete”. the classification of fungi as plant cell wall-degraders, non-degraders, dermatophytes and other ascomycetes is described in “methods” and in additional file  <dig> 



six aa10-encoding genes were predicted in the  <dig> fungal genomes but upon closer examination by blastp search of the encoded amino acid sequenced it was found that only two of these genes from the litter-decomposing basidiomycete galerina marginata and the smut ustilago maydis, which is a maize pathogen, encode putative aa <dig> proteins. the closest blast hit to the gene from g. marginata was a bacterial gene from streptomyces rimosus  whereas the closest hits to the gene from u. maydis were seven genes from basidiomycota  but also genes from streptomyces sp. were closely related .

to investigate whether the aa <dig> and aa <dig> are found in bacteria we used hotpep to mine  <dig> bacterial genomes for lpmos. however, no aa9- or aa11-encoding genes were found in the bacteria, which had from  <dig> to  <dig> aa10-encoding genes . the finding of  <dig> aa9s,  <dig> aa11s and only  <dig> aa10s in the  <dig> fungal genomes and  <dig> aa10s but no aa9s or aa11s in the bacterial genomes supports the notion that aa <dig> and aa <dig> are eukaryotic lpmos whereas aa <dig> are bacterial.

discussion
the reclassification of the lpmos as auxiliary activities based on their enzymatic and structural similarities is an important step towards a systematic analysis of these enzymes and their substrate preferences  <cit> . however, each of the three families of lpmos contains a large number of very divergent sequences and only a few of these have been enzymatically characterized. hence, the further division of the lpmos into ppr-generated subfamilies of proteins with related sequences provides a short cut to a systematic characterization of the lpmos. to obtain as comprehensive sequence information about the lpmos as possible we included not only the aa <dig>  aa <dig> and aa <dig> sequences listed in the cazy database in the ppr analysis but also a wide selection of lpmo-like sequences found by similarity search in genbank. we have previously used this approach to analyze the aa <dig> proteins, which lead to the discovery of the aa <dig> proteins that were classified as gh <dig> subfamily  <dig>  <cit> . in the present work the expanded lpmo families were divided into  <dig> aa <dig>   <dig> aa <dig> and  <dig> aa <dig> subfamilies compared to only  <dig> aa <dig>   <dig> aa <dig> and  <dig> aa <dig> subfamilies when only lpmo sequences from the cazy database were included. thus, the expansion leads to a more comprehensive characterization of the families and is easily handled by the ppr algorithm. one drawback is that a number of proteins that are not true lpmos were included in the expanded sequence pools. this complication was reduced by removing most domains not relevant for the lpmo catalytic activity from the sequences before ppr analysis. furthermore, after ppr analysis each subfamily was examined by cdd and blast search  <cit>  and inspected manually to remove all subfamilies that do not include lpmos. we have previously found that grouping proteins with ppr leads to exclusion of unrelated proteins  <cit> . thus, any non-lpmo sequence that might have sneaked in to the sequence pool was excluded from the subfamilies of lpmos. this approach made it possible to annotate 31% more lpmos based on the expanded lpmo lists in the  <dig> fungal genomes that have previously been investigated and annotated based only on the lpmos found in cazy  <cit> .

for gh families including proteins with different functions ppr divides the proteins into subfamilies that correlate largely to the functions of the proteins  <cit> . an important purpose of the present analysis was to correlate sequence information for the lpmos to functional data. as the enzymatically characterized aa <dig> proteins were classified to only six of the  <dig> subfamilies there is a host of aa9s with very different sequences that remain to be characterized. comparison of aa9s from plant cell wall degrading asco- and basidiomycetes to aa9s in non-degrading asco- and basidiomycetes showed which of these subfamilies may be associated to degradation of lignocellulose. however, lpmos with high ability to enhance lignocellulose degradation may belong to different subfamilies as exemplified by the t. aurantiacus lpmo and the thielavia terrestris lpmo  <cit>  classified in subfamily  <dig> and subfamily  <dig> that were very distant in the cluster analysis of the aa <dig> subfamilies. the catalytic activities of the lpmos in subfamily  <dig> have been reported as endoglucanase for the enzyme from trichoderma reesei  <cit>  and monooxygenase yielding c1- and c <dig> oxidized products for the enzyme from podospora anserina  <cit> . three aa <dig> enzymes from neurospora crassa fall into the closely related subfamilies  <dig> and  <dig> but represent different catalytic mechanisms as the two enzymes in subfamily  <dig> are c1-oxidizing and c4-oxidizing and the enzyme in subfamily  <dig> is both c1- and c4-oxidizing  <cit> . likewise, the enzymes in the related subfamilies  <dig> and  <dig> are a c1-oxidising lpmo from n. crassa and a c1- and c4-oxidizing lpmo from phanerochaete chrysosporium  <cit> . hence, there does not seem to be a clear correlation between the catalytic mechanisms of the aa <dig> lpmos and their subfamily annotation. the classification of a hemicellulose-oxidizing lpmo  <cit>  into subfamily  <dig> together with a cellulose-oxidizing lpmo  <cit>  does not point to a clear division of the lpmos based on substrate recognition. however, there is limited knowledge about the substrate specificity of the lpmos. hence, more lpmos need to be characterized to reach a definite conclusion. interestingly, many genomes of fungi degrading plant cell wall material possess several genes encoding betaglucosidases, endoglucanases and aa9-type lpmos indicating that degradation of different, complex substrates may require different enzyme with the same activity  <cit> . this notion points to that a comprehensive understanding of the properties of different lpmos requires studies on complex natural substrates.

the aa <dig> family proteins have been described to oxidize two substrates, chitin and cellulose, that are built from different monomer carbohydrates. interestingly, the cellulose- oxidizing aa10s  <cit>  are found in the closely related subfamilies  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> that are far from the subfamilies  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> that contain only chitin-oxidizing aa10s  <cit> . although the characterized aa <dig> protein from thermobifida fusca in subfamily  <dig> is able to oxidize both cellulose and chitin  <cit>  this separation of the lpmos in the aa <dig> family according to substrate indicates that the subfamily classification may be used to predict the putative substrate of uncharacterized lpmos. however, a confirmation of this possibility will await biochemical characterization of more lpmos.

in contrast to the aa <dig> lpmos, the number of aa11-encoding genes did not correlate to the degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose but rather to the fungal taxonomy as these genes were found in  <dig> of the  <dig> ascomycetes and in only four of the  <dig> basidiomycetes: the non-cellulose-degrading cryptococcus neoformans and tremella mesenterica, the white rot fungus ceriporiopsis subvermispora and the white rot-causing fungus s. commune. the putative amino acid sequences encoded by the genes from c. neoformans and t. mesenterica share  <dig> of  <dig> amino acids and  <dig> of  <dig> amino acids, respectively, with a gene from the dermatophyte blastomyces dermatitidis. the seven genes from s. commune are closely related in groups of two and five genes and appear to originate from two different genes. the sequence from c. vermispora is only  <dig> amino acids long and does not have any significant hits in blastp search. interestingly, the comparison of the occurrence of aa <dig> subfamilies showed that dermatophytes have more than three times as many aa <dig> subfamily  <dig> encoding-genes than other ascomycetes. this result suggests that skin may contain a substrate for aa <dig> subfamily  <dig>  dermatophyte invasion in immunocompetent individuals is usually restricted to the keratinized, non-living material and involves the expression of a host of keratinases  <cit> . it is likely that the aa <dig> takes part in this degradation and may attack keratin or another macromolecule of the extracellular matrix. the only enzymatically characterized aa <dig> protein from a. oryzae is a chitinase  <cit> , which is classified in subfamily  <dig>  a number of genes encoding proteins with a chitin-binding lysm domain have been identified in the genomes of dermatophytes  <cit> . the dermatophyte genomes do also contain chitinase-encoding genes and it is likely that some of their lysm-domain containing proteins are involved in chitin degradation  <cit> . however, some of the lysm-encoding genes of t. rubrum are specifically expressed when this dermatophyte grows on keratin thus suggesting a link between degradation of keratin and apparent chitin-binding proteins  <cit> . in analogy with the lysm-containing proteins the aa <dig> proteins from subfamily  <dig> may be used by the dermatophytes for growth on chitin but it is also possible that they have a role in growth on keratin.

in the context of industrial use of lpmos for degradation of plant cell wall materials and productions of biofuels such as ethanol  <cit>  the present results indicate the search for new lpmo enzymes should focus on the aa <dig> family and possibly on the aa <dig> subfamilies that contain cellulose-degrading enzymes and on related subfamilies.

the two basidiomycetes c. neoformans and s. commune that posses aa11-encoding genes are known to cause human infections  <cit>  and it would be interesting to investigate whether their aa <dig> genes are induced during infection. on the other hand, no reports link the basidiomycete t. mesenterica that has an aa11-encoding gene, to human infections but this fungus is a fungal parasite  <cit>  and could use the aa <dig> protein for degradation of the chitin-containing cell wall of its host.

overall, the genome analysis is consistent with that aa <dig> and aa <dig> are eukaryotic lpmos whereas aa <dig> are bacterial. nevertheless, the genomes of the litter-decomposing basidiomycete g. marginata and the smut u. maydis encoded aa10-like proteins. these genes were closely related to bacterial lpmos suggesting that g. marginata and u. maydis acquired their aa <dig> genes through horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . for example, in its yeast form u. maydis interacts with bacteria in the phyllosphere, which contains a large variety of bacteria and fungi  <cit> . the considerably larger number of lpmos that were generally found in the fungal genomes compared to bacterial genomes is consistent with the notion that eukaryotic genomes are larger, often redundant and contains more genes than eubacterial genomes  <cit> .

comparison of the distribution of the conserved peptides on the lpmo sequences indicated two conserved regions in accordance with previous findings for the gh <dig> family  <cit> . one of the conserved regions is consistent with the substrate binding site of the lpmos and the conserved surface residues in each subfamily have been identified and may be involved in recognition of different substrates  <cit> . in the present work we found that also the aa <dig> family had a conserved region around amino acids  <dig> -  <dig> but a slightly different structure of conserved peptides towards the n-terminal than the aa <dig> and aa <dig> families.

we have previously shown that ppr can be used for dividing  <dig> aa <dig> and aa <dig> proteins into subfamilies  <cit> . in the present work ppr demonstrated its ability to subdivide  <dig> lpmos. this subdivision could be used to annotate the lpmos in fungal and bacterial genomes. it is also possible to annotate cazymes by the use of a gene prediction algorithm followed by mapping of conserved domains  <cit>  or directly through the cazy database  <cit> . however, by using ppr the training set can be expanded beyond the sequences found in cazy, which is a useful feature when an exhaustive analysis is required. this feature is also important for analysis of protein families that are not classified in high-quality databases such as cazy.

CONCLUSIONS
the lpmos are important enzymes for microbiological degradation of cellulose, chitin and related poly- and oligoshaccharides  <cit> . nevertheless, only a few of these enzymes have been characterized. the classification of the lpmos into the three protein families aa <dig>  aa <dig> and aa <dig> is an important step towards understanding the divergence of this large group of very divergent sequences  <cit> . in the present work we have collected the lpmos and available lpmo-like sequences from public databases and arranged them into subfamilies. this analysis showed that the functionally characterized lpmos do only represent a small part of the natural sequence variation of these enzymes. moreover, it pinpointed the subfamilies of lpmos that have not been functionally characterized and thus have the highest probability of having different properties than the already described lpmos. in this context it is relevant that the aa <dig> enzymes that oxidize cellulose belong to three closely related subfamilies. moreover, some aa <dig> subfamilies were mainly found in dermatophytic ascomycetes pointing to a putative function of these enzymes in keratinolysis. in contrast to the substrate preference of the aa <dig> enzymes there does not seem to be a correlation between the subfamilies and a c1- or c4-oxidation as catalytic mechanism.

genome mining of the lpmos in fungi showed that the aa <dig> lpmos were found mainly in the genomes of asco- and basidiomycetes capable of degrading plant biomass whereas genes for aa <dig> lpmos were present in the genomes of ascomycetes and in only few of the basidiomycetes.
