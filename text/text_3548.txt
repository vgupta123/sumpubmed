BACKGROUND
charles darwin conceived not only the theory of natural selection, but also recognized that a theory of sexual selection is necessary to explain the presence of conspicuous traits in male animals that could not have arisen by natural selection  <cit> . a number of studies provided evidence that sexual selection increases taxonomic diversity, although it remains somewhat controversial if and how sexual selection alone can cause speciation . the body of theory about sexual selection has been extended through several new insights that explain the evolution of sexually selected traits and mating behaviour. fishes of the genus xiphophorus are a popular model in which various aspects of sexual selection have been studied extensively . the most prominent sexually selected trait in male swordtail fish of the genus is the sword, a conspicuously pigmented elongation of the ventral caudal fin. the sword consists of several components, i.e. a ventral fin elongation and a characteristic pigmentation pattern  <cit> . in the green swordtail x. helleri, it consists of centrally located yellow-orange or green coloured rays, that are flanked dorsally and ventrally by rays with strong melanisation . both length and colouration are important for mating success  <cit> .

the evolutionary history of the sword is of particular interest. one scenario, supported by molecular phylogenies, suggests that all extant xiphophorus species, swordtails and sword-less platyfish, descended from a common, sworded ancestor  <cit> . moreover, short extensions of the ventral portion of the caudal fin are also phylogenetically widespread and, for example, are found in poecilia petenensis  <cit> . platyfish , a common name that is used to describe several swordless species that belong to a monophyletic clade within the genus xiphophorus, however, secondarily lost their sword during evolution, possibly because the costs in terms of natural selection were higher than the gain in terms of sexual selection. nonetheless, females of some platy species in which this has been tested still prefer sworded males over the swordless males of their own species  <cit> . the preference for elongated caudal fins seems to be much older than the trait itself, since it is also present in at least one species of the sister genus priapella  <cit> . therefore, the sword is thought to have evolved in response to a pre-existing female bias, such as a general preference for the apparent size  <cit> . due to this interesting evolutionary history, the sword presents a valuable model to study how evolution acts at the molecular level to generate or abolish a sexually selected trait. this objective has also driven research in other animals, e.g. the colour morphs in males of the livebearing fish poecilia parae  <cit> , the exaggerated hypercephaly in stalk-eyed flies  <cit> , or the horns of dung beetles  <cit> . all of these are examples of model systems in which the basis of change in male exaggerated traits under sexual selection is amenable to genetic dissection.

one way to address this question in swordtails is to dissect the genetic pathways that might be involved in the development of the sword and to characterize these within a phylogenetic framework of the entire genus that involves swordtails and platyfish. so far, only little is known about the molecular basis of sword development. hybridisation experiments between x. helleri and x. cortezi revealed that multiple genes control sword development, which were collectively termed "sword genes" , i.e. genes or alleles that confer an ability to produce a sword in hybrids of platyfish and swordtails  <cit> . in addition, fin ray transplantation experiments have shown that sword rays are characterized by the possession of an organizing activity that induces neighbouring fin rays to contribute to the sword  <cit> . sword-induction experiments with juvenile swordtails, treated with exogenous testosterone, revealed that testosterone is a sufficient and essential factor that induces sword development  <cit> . exogenous testosterone also induces the development of the gonopodium , a modified anal fin used as a copulation organ that is common to all fish in the family poeciliidae . this might suggest that androgen signalling regulates a molecular pathway that induces both sword and gonopodium development. interestingly, some platy species develop a small ventral extension of the caudal fin through testosterone treatment  <cit> , suggesting that the genetic machinery underlying sword development is still partly intact even in normally swordless platyfishes. most likely, this machinery has never been lost completely, even though it might have been inactive for more than a million years  <cit> .

genes that regulate growth-dependent processes like fin regeneration are good candidates for genes involved in sword development. a candidate gene approach revealed msxc , a gene known to act in fin regeneration, to be specifically up-regulated in developing swords and gonopodia  <cit> . by combining available genetic and phylogenetic data, it was hypothesized that genes and pathways that shape the evolutionarily older gonopodium have been partly adapted for sword development  <cit> .

other putative candidate genes for sword development are upstream regulators of msxc, such as components of the fgf  signalling pathway. fgf signalling controls epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in the external genital anlagen of mammalian embryos  <cit> . fibroblast growth factor receptor  <dig>  appears to regulate msxc and msxb expression during caudal fin regeneration in zebrafish and is required for regenerative outgrowth of fin rays  <cit> . furthermore, fgf ligands such as those encoded by the fgf <dig> and fgf20a genes have been shown to play a role in caudal fin regeneration or pectoral fin development  <cit> . to test a putative role of fgf-signalling in sword development we cloned the fgf receptor  <dig> and two fgf orthologs, fgf <dig> and fgf20a, from the swordtail x. helleri and analysed their expression pattern in developing swords and gonopodia as well as regenerating swords. from a developmental point of view, we asked whether regulation of fgf genes expression is associated with growth of the sword and gonopodium during development and sword regeneration. from an evolutionary standpoint, we were interested in evaluating whether potential differences in fgf gene expression between swordtails and platy species contribute to the understanding of the molecular changes that led to the loss of the sword during evolution. furthermore, we analysed the expression of fgfr <dig> and msxc in regenerating caudal fins in the platyfish x. maculatus fin overgrowth mutant brushtail, where medial rays of the caudal fin continue to grow throughout the entire life of the animal . we show that genes are regulated similarly in regenerating sword rays and elongated brush rays, although sword regeneration proceeds differently from regeneration in brushtail.

RESULTS
cloning and analysis of fgf genes
since sword development in x. helleri requires the growth of caudal fin rays, genes that act to regulate growth in the regenerating zebrafish caudal fin appeared to be suitable candidate genes that may also be involved in sword development. up-regulation of fgfr <dig> and msx gene expression has originally been observed in the blastema during zebrafish fin regeneration  <cit> , and it had subsequently been shown that inhibition of fgf signaling during ongoing fin regeneration prevents further outgrowth and down-regulates the established expression of blastemal msx genes  <cit> . fgf <dig> and fgf20a encode putative fgfr <dig> ligands that are expressed or fulfill important functions in zebrafish fin regeneration  <cit> . to clone the xiphophorus orthologs from the green swordtail, xiphophorus helleri, we used a rt-pcr strategy and caudal fin blastemata as source for mrna. the amplified fragment of the fibroblast growth factor receptor  <dig>  covers  <dig> bp of the protein's open reading frame, including parts of the ig domain ii, the complete ig domain iii and parts of the tyrosine kinase domain , found in vertebrate fgfr <dig>  <cit> . phylogenetic reconstruction of the fgf receptor family, using coding sequence, confirmed that we cloned a partial sequence of the x. helleri fgfr <dig> ortholog .

the two cloned cdna fragments of fgf <dig> include the complete coding sequence of fgf <dig>  parts of the 5'utr and the whole 3'utr sequence. the  <dig> bp orf  of x. helleri fgf <dig> codes for a  <dig> amino acid protein with a heparin-binding growth factors/fibroblast growth factor  family signature . phylogenetic analysis of the  <dig> bp cdna sequence verified the sequence to be the x. helleri fgf <dig> ortholog .

in addition we cloned two cdna fragments of fgf20a, that together cover most of the coding and the complete 3'utr sequence. the partial protein sequence, coded by  <dig> bp , shows a conserved hbgf/fgf motif . interestingly, there is a qh-rich  motif close the n-terminus of the sequence . this motif could not be found in fgf20a sequences of other vertebrate species. the phylogenetic analysis of the coding sequence confirmed it to be the x. helleri fgf20a ortholog .

fgfr <dig> and msxc are differently regulated in caudal fins of maturing swordails and platyfish
in order to test whether fgf-signalling is involved in sword development of the green swordtail, x. helleri , we treated 4– <dig> month old juvenile fish with 17-α-methyltestosterone to artificially induce this process. to allow both for the simultaneous generation of large numbers of experimental animals and for timed induction of sword development we prematurely induced swords in juvenile fish. importantly, hormonally induced swords in immature juveniles do not show any sex-related morphological differences  <cit> . even adult females develop a sword under testosterone treatment that is indistinguishable from the male sword both in length and pigmentation  <cit> , therefore the sex of the individual should not bias the downstream analysis.

in developing swords, fgfr <dig> expression was first observed after  <dig> days of hormone treatment , when black pigmentation along the dorsal border of the sword also becomes visible . after  <dig> dt, when the outgrowth of sword rays had started, fgfr <dig> was mainly up-regulated in the distal tip of the main ventral sword-forming fin rays v7–v <dig>  compared to median or dorsal rays . however, fgfr <dig> was expressed much more strongly in v7–v <dig> than in v <dig> . a slight up-regulation of fgfr <dig> was also detected in ray v <dig> . importantly, this pattern is comparable to that of msxc a gene that is strongly up-regulated in developing swords . up-regulation of fgfr <dig> was not observed in control fins . this overlap in expression pattern of fgfr <dig> and msxc persists during later stages of sword outgrowth . these finding suggest that high levels of fgfr <dig> expression correlate with the development of ventral caudal fin rays into swords. furthermore, the spatio-temporal overlap of both fgfr <dig> and msxc expression patterns indicate a likely interaction of these genes during sword development.

to test if changes in the regulation of fgfr <dig> and msxc are linked to the absence of the sword in platyfish, we assayed the expression of both genes in the caudal fin of the platyfish x. maculatus  after  <dig> and  <dig> days of testosterone treatment. the expression of both genes in caudal fins at  <dig> dt differs clearly between x. helleri and x. maculatus. in x. maculatus both genes are uniformly expressed with no differences between sword and non-sword rays . in addition, the expression patterns of both genes in testosterone treated fins are quite similar to those of control fins . at  <dig> dt however, both genes are up-regulated in a subset of ventral fin rays . this expression pattern is likely to mark the fin rays that will form a small caudal extension under high exogenous levels of testosterone  <cit> . based on the expression data, we conclude that loss of sword ray specific regulation of fgfr <dig> or msxc could have been involved in the secondary loss of this trait in platyfish.

fgfr <dig> and msxc regulation in maturing anal fins is conserved between swordtails and platyfish
males of both platyfish and swordtails as juveniles possess typical anal fins, that during sexual maturation transform into a gonopodium, an intromittent organ for internal fertilisation  <cit> . despite some differences in gonopodium morphology between species, all gonopodia are formed by anal fin rays 3– <dig> that develop into a structure that can deliver sperm into the females genital tract as well as scrape out sperm of other males through hooks that are formed by modification of fin ray elements . we expected that gonopodia of both swordtails and platyfish show a similar spatio-temporal pattern of fgfr <dig> and msxc expression. because it was impractical to identify sufficient numbers of normally developing male juvenile fish at the desired stages, we analysed the expression patterns of both genes in artificially induced gonopodia of the swordtail x. helleri and the platyfish x. maculatus.

at  <dig> days of testosterone treatment, strong expression of fgfr <dig> was found in the distal part of the main gonopodial rays  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the so-called 3–4– <dig> complex  <cit>  of x. helleri . because gene expression in deeper layers of fin rays may be shielded from detection during whole mount in situ hybridisation  <cit> , we performed in situ hybridisation on longitudinal sections which reveal strongest expression of fgfr <dig> in mesenchymal cells at the tip of growing gonopodial rays . this pattern persists during later stages of gonopodium development . in addition, fgfr <dig> is up-regulated in the interray tissue .

as in developing swords, the spatio-temporal expression pattern of fgfr <dig> is similar to that of msxc, which is up-regulated in the mesenchyme of gonopodial rays  <dig> to  <dig> and in interray tissue . both genes are not up-regulated in untreated fins .

the spatio-temporal expression pattern of fgfr <dig> and msxc in developing gonopodia of the platyfish x. maculatus approximately resembles the pattern found in x. helleri. both genes are up-regulated in the distal part of the gonopodial rays  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and in the interray tissue  compared to control fins . the different shapes of the distal fin ray tips in x. maculatus and x. helleri are due to species-specific differences between the gonopodia  <cit> .

fgfr <dig> and msxc show similar expression profiles in regenerating swords
high levels of msxc transcription are also associated with regenerating sword rays after amputation  <cit> . it is assumed that the general mechanisms of growth control that act during early development are re-established during regeneration  <cit> . to test whether fgfr <dig> is similarly regulated in regenerating and in developing sword rays, we assayed gene expression in caudal fin blastemata. the regeneration kinetics of x. helleri roughly equals that of zebrafish at 25°c, where the regenerative outgrowth starts at ~ <dig> dpa  <cit> . fgfr <dig> is expressed in the basal layer of the epidermis and in a proximal region, which are likely to be scleroblasts . msxc and fgfr <dig> expression overlap in these cells. furthermore, msxc is not expressed in the basal epidermal layer, but transcription is high in the distal blastema . sword rays and non-sword rays show similar levels of fgfr <dig> and msxc at different stages of regenerative outgrowth . both genes stay highly up-regulated in growing blastemata until  <dig> dpa .

at  <dig> dpa, when the sword region has begun to overgrow the rest of the regenerate, fgfr <dig> and msxc become differently regulated in sword rays compared to other rays. both fgfr <dig>  and msxc  are more strongly expressed in sword rays than in non-sword rays, even though this difference in expression was more clearly observed for msxc. judging from these data, it is apparent that both genes are similarly regulated in developing as well as regenerating swords. furthermore, it is likely that due to the lack of fgfr <dig> expression in the distal blastema, msxc expression in this domain is regulated by factors other than fgfr <dig> 

fgf <dig> and fgf20a are expressed in regenerating, but not developing swords
to further analyse the regulation of sword development and regeneration upstream of fgfr <dig>  we cloned two putative ligands of fgfr <dig>  fgf <dig> and fgf20a, which are known to be involved in fin regeneration and development  <cit> . to this end we examined the expression patterns of both genes in developing and regenerating swords. we detected strong expression of fgf <dig> and fgf20a in caudal fin regenerates up to  <dig> dpa and ~ <dig> dpa, respectively, before the transcription rate of both genes decreased . therefore both genes are unlikely to play a role in the regulation of fgf-signalling or msxc in later stages of sword regeneration, when gene regulation becomes different between sword and non-sword rays. in addition, as neither fgf <dig> nor fgf20a were expressed in developing swords or gonopodia , it is unlikely that they act as ligands for fgfr <dig> during these processes.

expression levels of fgfr <dig> and msxc are correlated with growth rates of regenerating fin rays
to address the question whether enhanced fgfr <dig> and msxc expression are generally associated with extended growth of fin rays, we analysed gene expression in regenerating caudal fins of x. maculatus brushtail mutants . individuals carrying the dominant brushtail mutation are characterized by a life-long overgrowth of medial fin rays in the caudal fin , which is independent of sex or sexual maturity  <cit> . the mutation causing this phenotype is not known. mature male brushtail mutants also grow a swordlet, a small ventral fin extension , similar to the ventral caudal fin extension that naturally occurs in two species of platyfish, x. andersi and x. xiphidium, and similar to that which can be artificially produced by high levels of exogenous testosterone in some species of platyfish such as x. maculatus  <cit> . however, it lacks the pigmentation pattern typical of swords in swordtails. since brushtail mutants are already born with a brush  <cit>  and developing embryos are not viable when extracted from their mothers, we asked whether fgfr <dig> and msxc are differently expressed in regenerating brush rays, compared to more dorsal or ventral caudal fin rays. expression of fgfr <dig> and msxc is strongest in the median fin rays , which becomes particularly obvious after  <dig> dpa. both genes show a graded expression pattern with a decrease of expression levels towards the dorsal and ventral fin margins . at later stages of regeneration fgfr <dig> and msxc are also stronger expressed in the ventral-most caudal fin rays of males that form the swordlet, but was absent in females .

the graded expression patterns suggest that fgfr <dig> and msxc correlate with different growth rates of median fin rays compared to more ventral or dorsal rays. in order to test this hypothesis, we amputated the caudal fins of adult brushtail mutants and compared the growth rates of regenerating fin rays at different positions within the caudal fin. we did this by calculating the average length difference between the regenerate of the median fin ray  <dig> and more dorsal fin rays  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> at  <dig> dpa and  <dig> dpa . we found that the individual fin rays show significantly different regeneration rates , depending on their position within the caudal fin, with the median-most ray  <dig> showing the fastest regeneration rate . the regeneration rate decreases the more closely a fin ray is located to the dorsal edge of the fin, with regenerating ray  <dig> showing the slowest regeneration rate . differences in regeneration rates between fin rays according to their position in the caudal fin are more pronounced at  <dig> dpa . the correlation between higher fgfr <dig> and msxc expression levels and enhanced regenerative outgrowth suggests that both genes are involved in modulating the growth rate of individual fin rays.

discussion
the sword is a sexually selected trait in swordtail fish that is thought to have evolved in the common ancestor of all extant xiphophorus fishes, and was lost secondarily in the lineage leading to the platyfish  <cit> . questions about the evolution and the subsequent loss of the sword can therefore be cogently formulated within this phylogenetic framework. zander and dzwillo coined the term "sword genes" for those genes that confer an ability to produce a sword in hybrids of platyfish and swordtails  <cit> . we employed a candidate gene approach to more broadly identify genes involved in sword development. we reasoned that genes that act in growth-dependent processes like fin regeneration might also be suitable candidates for regulating growth in growing fin rays. we therefore evaluated changes to the expression of genes involved in fgf-signalling, a signalling pathway known to control outgrowth, and msxc expression in regenerating caudal fins of zebrafish  <cit> .

fgfr <dig> expression in developing and regenerating swords
our results show that fgfr <dig> is specifically up-regulated in growing fin rays of the sword and the gonopodial rays of the 3–4– <dig> complex as a response to the induction of male sexual trait formation by exogenously supplied testosterone. several studies suggest that fgfr <dig> plays essential roles during appendage formation and regeneration: expression of fgfr <dig> is re-established during regeneration of limbs and caudal fins  <cit> , and loss of fgfr <dig> function in these tissues blocks blastema formation and regenerative outgrowth  <cit> . moreover, fgfr <dig> is involved in supporting outgrowth of the mouse limb bud by maintaining mesenchymal cell survival and influencing the development and identity of digits  <cit> . interestingly, the spatio-temporal expression pattern of fgfr <dig> generally overlaps with that of the transcription factor msxc in developing swords and gonopodia  <cit> . msx genes are known to keep cells in an undifferentiated state by promoting cell proliferation  <cit> . in zebrafish, msxb has been shown to regulate cell proliferation in the distal blastema of regenerating caudal fins  <cit> . accordingly, knock-down and chemical inhibition of fgfr1-signalling abolishes the expression of msxb and msxc  <cit> . therefore, as judged by the up-regulation in growing sword and gonopodial rays, we propose that an increase in fgfr1-mediated signalling regulates cell-proliferation, similar to the processes in fin regeneration, through the activation of target genes like msxc.

are there positional values that bias the ventral caudal fin for sword development? in a set of transplantation experiments it has been shown that the two major sword rays, v <dig> and v <dig>  act to organize flanking rays into the developing sword  <cit> . this is achieved through a non-autonomous signalling process in which fin rays are induced to grow more strongly the closer they develop to v <dig> and v <dig>  the development of sword rays is initiated through androgen-signalling in maturing juvenile fish, which leads to mainly autonomous growth of rays v <dig> and v <dig> and inductive signalling to flanking rays v <dig> and v <dig>  which together comprise the mature sword. moreover, the potential to develop organizing activity in v <dig> and v <dig> is established during embryonic or larval development  <cit> . in zebrafish ventral tail fin tissue has been fate-mapped to late gastrula stage embryos  <cit> . it is therefore likely that positional information within the xiphophorus caudal fin is also attained during embryonic stages. genes of the tgfβ gene family, such as alk8/lost-a-fin or tolloid/mini fin, whose mutant phenotypes include defects of the ventral caudal fin  <cit> , could therefore provide all or part of the positional information that is used to specify sword ray fate.

to test whether fgfr <dig> and msxc are also differently regulated in regenerating swords, and to further characterize these interactions at the cellular level, we compared expression in regenerating sword and non-sword rays. an overlap of fgfr <dig> and msxc expression was detected in scleroblasts. in addition, fgfr <dig> is expressed in the basal layer of the epidermis, where msxc was not found, suggesting that signalling through fgfr <dig> alone is not sufficient to activate msxc expression in the basal epidermal layer. likewise, msxc is temporally activated in the distal blastema, although fgfr <dig> is absent from this domain, suggesting that msxc is regulated by signals other than fgfr <dig> in the distal blastema. interestingly, such a distal expression domain of fgfr <dig> is described in zebrafish  <cit> , indicating species-specific differences in fgfr1- and, probably, in msxc-regulation between x. helleri and d. rerio. this may not be all that surprising since these two fish species are evolutionary rather distantly related  <cit> . in addition, functional differences between zebrafish and medaka fgfr <dig> have recently been demonstrated  <cit> . we also noted that, although expression levels of fgfr <dig> are clearly elevated in sword rays, when compared to non-sword rays, the difference was never as strongly as that observed for msxc. a disproportionally higher activation, like for msxc, might be expected in a scenario where msxc expression is up-regulated as part of the downstream effects of signalling through fgfr <dig> 

fgfr <dig> and msxc are part of a network that regulates sword development
we previously proposed that the gene regulatory network underlying sword development did not evolve anew, but was co-opted from the gonopodium  <cit> . the 3–4– <dig> complex of the gonopodium is likely to have evolved only once in the common ancestors of all poeciliid fish and is thus evolutionary older than the sword, which originated in its fully developed form in the lineage leading to the genus xiphophorus  <cit> . in support of this view, the regulatory dynamics of fgfr <dig> and msxc show very similar expression patterns during gonopodium growth and caudal fin regeneration that are conserved between swordtails and platyfish, whereas differences in later stages of gonopodium development are likely to reflect differences in species-specific morphology  <cit> . the similarities in gene expression between swords and gonopodia supports the hypothesis that sword development evolved by co-option of an androgen-regulated genetic network from the evolutionary older gonopodium. fgfr <dig> is most likely one of a number of regulatory nodes within an intricate network of signalling pathways that converge on the activation of msx genes. the observation that there is only partial co-expression between fgfr <dig> and msxc during regeneration supports this notion.

there is compelling evidence that msx genes are also regulated by bmp signalling during development and regeneration of vertebrate appendages  <cit> . for example, inhibition of bmp signalling in the developing mouse limb leads to down-regulation of msx <dig>  <cit> , while over-activation of the pathway results in up-regulation of msx <dig> and msx <dig>  <cit> . activation may be direct, as bmp <dig> induces the interaction of smads with msx <dig> regulatory sequences  <cit> . bmp-regulation of msx genes seems to be widely conserved, since inhibition of bmp signalling also leads to down-regulation of msxb in regenerating fins  <cit>  and to a loss of msx <dig> expression in the regenerating tail of xenopus tadpoles  <cit> . wnt signalling is a third component of this regulatory network. manipulation of its activity in regenerating limbs, fins and tadpole tails showed that wnt signalling regulates the expression of msx and fgf genes and is important for regenerative outgrowth  <cit> . recent work in the poeciliid fish gambusia affinis had shown that induction of sonic hedgehog  expression by androgens is required for gonopodium formation  <cit> . given that shh controls dermal bone development in the zebrafish caudal fin  <cit> , it is likely that also shh signalling may be required for sword development. functional tests will be required to dissect the molecular network that controls msxc expression to better understand how these different signalling pathways act together to shape the male sword. the similarities in gene expression between swords and gonopodia supports the hypothesis that sword development evolved by co-option of a modular androgen-regulated fgfr1/msxc network from the evolutionary older gonopodium.

juveniles of x. maculatus fail to up-regulate fgfr <dig> and msxc in the ventral caudal fin rays at testosterone-levels that otherwise cause sword development in swordtails after  <dig> days of treatment. it is only after prolonged exposure that both genes start to be expressed more strongly in the ventral-most rays. this expression marks the development of a "swordlet", a small colourless caudal fin extension, that develops in some platy species under excessive exposure to testosterone  <cit> . a swordlet is also found naturally in the species x. andersi and x. xiphidium and outside the genus xiphophorus in other species of poeciliid fishes, e.g. in poecilia petenensis. the failure to up-regulate the fgfr1/msxc network in response to endogenous androgens may have caused the loss of swords in the lineage leading to the platyfish. since artificially high levels of testosterone can overcome this inhibition , the evolutionary changes that led to sword-loss may have been quantitative ones that could have altered the strength of genetic interactions within the fgfr1/msxc network or its upstream regulation. one attractive possibility for the evolutionary loss of swords therefore would be an acquired loss in the sensitivity of the fgfr1/msxc network to be activated by androgen-signalling , possibly at the level of fgf regulation.

brushtail enhances sword development in platyfish
we analysed fin ray regeneration in x. maculatus brushtail, a mutant that spontaneously arose in platy strains within the pet trade . the brush resembles the sword with regard to size, but occurs in both sexes, consists of medial fin rays, and lacks conspicuous pigmentation  <cit> . in contrast to swords, brushes are formed during embryonic or larval development and show allometric growth throughout the whole life of an individual. in adult male platyfish, brushtail often also induces a swordlet on the ventral caudal fin margin . the x. maculatus brushtail fish used in our studies are not congenic and may contain alleles derived from hybrids between swordtails and x. maculatus. it could thus be argued that brushtail hybrids are more inclined to develop swords due to introgression of sword alleles. however, we note that formation of the swordlet in males is always linked to the brushtail phenotype and does not occur in male brushless siblings that derive from a cross between brushtail parents. therefore brushtail enhances a dormant program of sword development  <cit> , similar to prolonged exposure to testosterone in x. maculatus. we thus reasoned that the mechanisms of fin growth in swords and brushes may be similar. our analysis of fin ray regeneration revealed that  regeneration rates in brushtail and swordtail caudal fins differed in that sword rays regenerate at the same rate as the rest of the fin , whereas rays within the brush exhibit accelerated regeneration rates the closer they are to the middle of the fin, and  expression levels of fgfr <dig> and msxc show a positive correlation with regeneration rates. therefore, brushtail mutants lend support to the hypothesis that the strength of fgfr1/msxc expression is correlated with the rate of regenerative growth, which in brushtail mirrors the life-long overgrowth of the brush. in contrast, sword rays initially exhibit regeneration rates and strong fgfr1/msxc expression indistinguishable from non-sword rays. growth and gene expression ceases once rays have reconstituted the previous fin length, while fgfr1/msxc transcription remains high in the sword. the correspondence of gene expression levels in swords, gonopodia, and in brushtail suggests that fgfr <dig> and msxc expression are a general readout of proliferation in fin rays.

pharmacological interference with fgfr <dig> signalling is not practicable in xiphophorus fish, as treatments using the standard zebrafish assay, where many fish are treated in small volumes of water, cause a high mortality, while treatments in volumes used in our testosterone experiments would require excessive amounts of the drug. moreover, electroporation of morpholinos has failed due to persistent problems with the initial injection, which has to be performed into growing fin rays, rather than into a regeneration blastema . therefore we had to resolve to associative studies of gene expression in a phylogenetic framework and in mutants to study the involvement of candidate genes in sword development.

as an explanation of the development of a swordlet in adult male brushtail platyfish, our findings suggest that fgfr1/msxc-mediated signalling is constitutively activated throughout the brushtail caudal fin and already in young larvae of both sexes, with strong activation in medial rays and lower, yet elevated levels at the margins. although endogenous levels of testosterone in platyfish are usually not sufficient to induce or maintain a sword, growth of a swordlet could nevertheless ensue if in maturing male platyfish both testosterone- and brushtail-activated signalling pathways converged on the activation of the fgfr1/msxc regulatory network. brushtail simulates the effect of high exogenous doses of testosterone on swordlet formation in platyfish, in agreement with the idea that the fgfr1/msxc network is a major downstream target of androgen signalling during sword development . it is interesting to note that brushtail re-awakens a dormant program for sword development that had been evolutionary lost in platyfish. therefore, swordlets likely employ at least parts of the developmental program controlling sword growth  <cit> . an examination of the molecular mechanisms that activate fgfr1/msxc signalling in brushtail will be valuable for exploring the regulation of this gene network in controlling the growth of ventral caudal fin rays.

the ligands required for fgfr <dig> activation during fin development remain elusive
to examine the regulation of fin growth upstream of fgfr <dig>  we isolated fgf20a and fgf <dig> as potential ligands in caudal fins that develop a sword under testosterone treatment. in zebrafish, fgf20a plays an essential role in blastema formation, while fgf <dig> is expressed in regenerating caudal fins and is required for pectoral fin bud initiation  <cit> . therefore, both genes are putative candidates to control early phases of sword and gonopodium development such as the re-initiation of fin growth under testosterone. we show that both genes are transiently expressed in regenerating fin rays and are down-regulated after  <dig> dpa, suggesting that fgf20a and fgf <dig> fulfill similar functions in blastema formation in zebrafish and x. helleri. since neither gene was expressed at any detectable level in developing swords or gonopodia, other fgfs remain attractive candidates that might mediate the activation of sword development downstream of testosterone-activated androgen receptors. a number of other fgfs are known with confirmed roles during appendage formation and regeneration, such as fgf <dig>  fgf <dig>  fgf <dig> and fgf <dig>  which are able to induce regeneration in xenopus limbs or chick limb buds  <cit> , and fgf <dig> as well as fgf <dig>  fgf <dig> and fgf <dig>  which are involved in zebrafish pectoral fin development . further investigation of these candidate genes should uncover the ligand of fgfr <dig> that controls development of the sword and gonopodium.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown a correspondence of fgfr <dig> and msxc expression levels in developing and regenerating swords, gonopodia, and in the fin-overgrowth mutant brushtail, which suggests that fgfr <dig> and msxc are part of a genetic network that regulates the rates of growth and regeneration in male-specific modifications of adult fins in swordtails and platyfish. through inter-species comparisons with swordless platyfish, we have shown that high levels of fgfr <dig> expression are associated with developing sword rays. in line with this assertion brushtail mutant caudal fin rays exhibit elevated expression of this network, leading both to a regionalised fin overgrowth phenotype and to an enhancement of an otherwise dormant program of sword development in platyfish. taken together, we propose that changes in the regulation of a genetic network that includes fgfr <dig> and msxc contribute to the loss of the sword in the platyfish lineage. our characterization of the two known regulators of fgf signalling in teleost fin regeneration, fgf20a and fgf <dig>  rules out an involvement in sword development, but other fgfs remain candidates that might mediate the activation of sword development downstream of testosterone-activated androgen receptors. finally, the similarities in gene expression between swords and gonopodia supports the hypothesis that sword development evolved by co-option of an androgen-regulated fgfr1/msxc network from the evolutionary older gonopodium.
