BACKGROUND
common causes of bladder pain are bacterial infection, painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis  and cancer. bladder pain in the absence of infection or bladder pathology is a feature of pbs/ic patients, along with increased frequency and urgency  <cit> . however, common rodent models of bladder pain usually produce significant bladder injury and inflammation  <cit> .

cyclophosphamide -induced cystitis  elicits severe bladder inflammation and urothelial damage along with significantly decreased abdominal mechanical threshold  <cit> . interestingly, cyp-induced bladder pain  was blocked by systemic administration of a high-mobility group box  <dig> protein  neutralizing antibody or a hmgb <dig> receptor antagonist without changing cyp-induced inflammation  <cit> .

hmgb <dig> is a ubiquitous and abundant non-histone nuclear chromatin-binding protein and a damage-associated molecular pattern molecule. hmgb <dig> is actively secreted in response to inflammatory signals, acting as a pro-inflammatory molecule in addition to its passive release from necrotic cells in various organs  <cit> . the extracellular activities of hmgb <dig> depend on the redox state of hmgb <dig> resulting in activation of different hmgb <dig> receptors. physical/chemical trauma to tissues or organs results in the release of all-thiol  hmgb <dig>  which binds to receptor for advanced glycation end products  and potentiates chemotaxis  <cit> . during inflammation, all-thiol hgmb <dig> may be oxidized to the disulfide form of hgmb <dig>  which then binds to toll-like receptor  <dig>  to induce cytokine production  <cit> . it is likely that both redox forms contribute to inflammation resulting from tissue damage. hmgb <dig> is a key player in the extracellular environment as a pro-inflammatory molecule and is also gaining prominence as a mediator in pain processing  <cit> .

we recently reported that activation of urothelial protease activated receptor  <dig>  elicits bladder pain in mice without causing overt bladder inflammation  <cit> . in this model, par <dig> activation results in release of urothelial macrophage migration inhibitory factor   <cit>  and hmgb <dig>  <cit>  along with abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity, representative of bladder pain. systemic pretreatment with mif antagonist prevented urothelial hmgb <dig> release  <cit>  and abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity caused by intravesical par4-activating peptide   <cit> . moreover, systemic administration of a hmgb <dig> inhibitor also blocked abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity caused by intravesical par4-ap  <cit> . this indicates that hmgb <dig> signaling is involved in par4-induced bladder pain. however, it is still not known which redox form of hmgb <dig> is responsible for bladder pain and the type or location of the hmgb <dig> receptor mediating the effect. the current study utilized two redox forms of hmgb <dig> and receptor-specific antagonists in a rodent model of bladder pain without inflammation to explore the etiology of bladder pain.

methods
animals
all animal experiments were approved by the lexington veterans affairs medical center institutional animal care and use committee  and performed according to the guidelines of the national institutes of health.

disulfide or all-thiol hmgb <dig> treatment by intravesical instillation
 <dig> – 17 week-old female c57bl/ <dig>  were accommodated in ventilated animal housing with 14/ <dig> light/dark cycle. isoflurane-anesthetized mice were transurethrally catheterized  and drained of urine. disulfide hmgb <dig>  all-thiol hmgb <dig>  or vehicle control groups   were randomly instilled into the bladder lumen and held for 1 hour  <cit> . in other experiments mouse groups were pretreated with tlr <dig> antagonist tak- <dig>   <cit> , or rage antagonist fps-zm <dig>   <cit> , either intraperitoneally  or intravesically . then 10 μg disulfide hmgb <dig> was instilled and held for 1 hour as described.

abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity test
abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity was tested in instilled mice as previously described  <cit> . briefly, von frey filaments of ascending bending force  were pressed to the lower abdominal region in trials of  <dig> before  and 24 hours after hmgb <dig> instillation. positive response was defined as any one of three behaviors: 1) licking the abdomen, 2) flinching/jumping, or 3) abdomen withdrawal. mice responding more than 30% to the weakest filament  during baseline testing were excluded from the study.

awake mice were tested for abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity and micturition changes 24 hours after bladder instillation.

voided stain on paper : micturition volume and frequency
micturition volume and frequency were measured in mice using vsop method  <cit> . briefly, mice were gavaged with water  to induce diuresis, then placed in a plastic enclosure and allowed to move freely. filter paper was placed under each mouse to collect urine during a 2-hour observation period. micturition volumes were determined by linear regression using a set of known volumes. micturition frequency was defined as the number of micturition within 2 hours.

histology
bladders were removed under anesthesia, fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin for histology and mice were euthanized at the end of the experiment.

paraffin sections  were processed for routine hematoxylin and eosin  staining. h&e stained sections were evaluated by a pathologist blinded to the experimental treatment and scored separately for edema and inflammation according to the following scale: 0 = no edema; no infiltrating cells; 1 = mild submucosal edema; occasional inflammatory cells; 2 = moderate edema; several inflammatory cells; 3 = frank edema, vascular congestion; many inflammatory cells  <cit> .

statistical analyses
changes in positive response frequency  to von frey stimulation at baseline and 24 hours after treatment were evaluated using a within subject 2-way  anova. when the time factor  was significant, differences at each filament strength were compared  using t-tests with a multiple comparison adjustment   <cit> . single t-tests  were performed for the histological scores.

all data are presented as mean ± se  <cit> , with statistical differences of p ≤  <dig>  considered significant. all statistical analyses were performed using r  <cit> .

RESULTS
hmgb <dig> redox form elicits abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity
we measured responses to von frey filaments applied to the abdominal/perineal area at baseline  and 24 hours after bladder hmgb <dig> instillation of either disulfide hmgb <dig> or all-thiol hmgb <dig> . intravesical vehicle control,  <dig> or 2 μg of disulfide hmgb <dig> did not cause any abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity 24 hours after instillation . figure 1d shows that 5 μg  of disulfide hmgb <dig> resulted in significant mechanical hypersensitivity of abdominal/perineal area only with the highest filament tested . higher doses of disulfide hmgb <dig>  <dig>  or 20 μg  significantly increased von frey responses compared to baseline for all filaments tested . in contrast, intravesical all-thiol hmgb <dig> did not cause any change in abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity for any of the doses tested .fig.  <dig> disulfide and all-thiol hmgb <dig> dose response effects on abdominal mechanical thresholds.  vehicle control,  1 μg  and  2 μg  disulfide hmgb <dig> did not affect abdominal mechanical threshold.  5 μg  disulfide hmgb <dig> significantly increased abdominal sensitivity using a  <dig>  g filament.  10 μg  and  20 μg  disulfide hmgb <dig> significantly induced abdominal hypersensitivity using all four von frey filaments. none of the all-thiol hmgb <dig> doses  1 μg ,  2 μg ,  5 μg ,  10 μg  and  20 μg  changed abdominal mechanical sensitivity. *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig>  compared with pre-instillation

effect of tlr <dig> and rage antagonism on disulfide hmgb <dig> induced hypersensitivity
we chose the first dose of disulfide hmgb <dig> that showed significantly increased abdominal mechanical sensitivity across all von frey filaments  without inflammation to test the effect of specific hmgb <dig> receptor antagonism. pretreatment with specific tlr <dig>  or rage  antagonists was used to investigate which receptor signaling mechanism was activated by intravesical disulfide hmgb <dig> resulting in increased abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity.fig.  <dig> tlr <dig> or rage antagonist pretreatment prevented abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity induced disulfide hmgb <dig>   10 μg disulfide hmgb <dig> significantly increased abdominal mechanical sensitivity  using all four von frey filaments .  intravesical tlr <dig> antagonist tak <dig> blocked disulfide hmgb <dig> induced abdominal hypersensitivity .  intraperitoneal tak <dig> reduced mechanical hypersensitivity induced by 10 μg disulfide hmgb <dig> .  intravesical infusion of rage antagonist psf-zm <dig>  however, did not affect abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity induced by disulfide hmgb <dig> .  intraperitoneal injection of psf-zm <dig> prevented disulfide hmgb <dig> induced mechanical hypersensitivity . *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig>  twenty-four hours post-instillation compared with pre-instillation




intravesical pretreatment with tak- <dig>  prior to bladder instillation completely blocked abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity induced by disulfide hmgb <dig> for all the filaments . no difference was detected between pre and post disulfide hmgb <dig> instillation . on the other hand, disulfide hmgb1-induced abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity was not blocked when fps-zm <dig>  was infused into the bladder before disulfide hmgb <dig> bladder instillation . there were still significant differences between pre and post disulfide hmgb <dig> instillation for all von frey filaments .

systemic  treatment with either tlr <dig> antagonist tak- <dig>   <cit>  or rage antagonist fps-zm <dig>   <cit>  before intravesical infusion of disulfide hmgb <dig>  prevented hmgb1-induced abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity .

pretreatment of tlr <dig> and rage antagonists on micturition and histology
intravesical disulfide hmgb <dig>  did not change micturition volume or frequency . no micturition changes were observed in groups pre-treated with tlr <dig> and rage antagonists either intraperitoneally  or intravesically  followed by intravesical disulfide hmgb <dig> when compared to disulfide hmgb <dig> instillation only group .

pretreatment, either i.p. or intravesically, with tlr <dig> or rage antagonist did not elicit bladder inflammation . pretreatment with hmgb <dig> antagonist  followed by intravesical disulfide hmgb <dig>  also showed minimal increases  in edema  compared to vehicle control  or compared to intravesical disulfide  .

discussion
we recently reported that intravesical activation of urothelial par <dig> receptors resulted in release of urothelial hmgb <dig>  which mediated bladder pain  <cit> . release of urothelial adenosine triphosphate  and activation of transit receptor potential vanilloid  <dig>  are well-described mechanisms of bladder pain . whether hmgb <dig> elicits bladder pain through atp and/or trpv <dig> remains to be investigated.

the present study extends our earlier findings since we clearly demonstrate that hmgb <dig> infused into the bladder is capable of inducing abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity . furthermore, the redox state of hmgb <dig> is important since only intravesical disulfide hmgb <dig> but not the all-thiol  form induced abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity.

we also examined physiological and histological changes in response to different doses and different redox forms of hmgb <dig> infused intravesically. changes in micturition parameters were only observed with the highest dose of disulfide and all-thiol hmgb <dig>  whereas none of the lower doses had any effect on micturition . in terms of histological changes, only the highest dose tested  of either disulfide or all-thiol hmgb <dig> was able to elicit minimal bladder inflammation , while minimal to mild bladder edema and subtle stromal reactive changes were present with all doses of either disulfide or all-thiol hmgb <dig>  these histological findings are consistent with our previous publication that hmgb <dig> mediates bladder pain without overt bladder inflammation  <cit> . similarly, intraplantar injection of hmgb <dig> at  <dig> and 20 μg caused paw withdrawal latency decrease as well as edema but only 20 μg hmgb <dig> elicited mild inflammation in hind paw  <cit> . furthermore, our findings that disulfide hmgb <dig> mediates bladder pain in a model with no overt bladder inflammation extend the findings of tanaka et al  <cit>  who found that systemic hmgb <dig> antagonists could prevent bladder pain after chemical  injury of the bladder but did not affect inflammatory changes in this chemical cystitis model.

recent studies implicate hmgb <dig> in mediating pain both at the organ level and at the central nervous system level   <cit> . pain hypersensitivity was elicited when hmgb <dig> was injected into sciatic nerve and anti-hmgb <dig> treatment alleviated mechanical allodynia after injury, but the nociceptive signaling pathway is still unclear  <cit> . thrombomodulin  treatment alleviates intraplantar injection hmgb <dig> induced mechanical hypersensitivity, indicating hmgb1’s peripheral effect in nociception  <cit> . as an endogenous inflammatory mediator, hmgb <dig> influences adjacent neurons and glia, which contributes to the development of neuropathic pain states  <cit> . one report showed an increase in hmgb <dig> re-distribution into cytoplasm of sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglion in a model of tibial nerve injury induced neuropathic pain  <cit> . in this model, systemic application of glycyrrhizin, a hmgb <dig> blocker, reversed the neuropathic pain  <cit> . tlr <dig> and rage receptors were shown to be mediating nociception differentially in peripheral tissue and nervous system while hmgb <dig> redox forms recognize their receptors respectively . tlr <dig> downregulation in spinal glial cells attenuates mechanical allodynia in a rat model of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid induced chronic pancreatitis  <cit> . on the other hand, rage mrna and protein were increased in dorsal root ganglia after tibial nerve injury and rage inhibition by neutralizing antibody reversed the pain related behavior  <cit> . there is also evidence that systemic or intrathecal hmgb <dig> neutralizing antibody or a specific antagonist can alleviate pain mediated by tlr <dig> or rage receptors, suggesting central effect of tlr <dig> and rage receptors  <cit> .

two strategies were used in the current study to identify the hmgb <dig> receptor mediating the disulfide hmgb1-induced abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity. a dose of disulfide hmgb <dig>  that produced no inflammation and only minimal edema was chosen for the intravesical infusion. systemic pretreatment with either a tlr <dig>  or a rage  antagonist blocked abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity induced by disulfide hmgb <dig>  since both of these antagonists cross the blood-brain barrier  <cit> , the effect may be due to antagonism of central tlr <dig> or rage receptors and these receptors mediate pain in other models  <cit> . we applied antagonists intravesically to determine whether and which of these receptors mediated the effect of disulfide hmgb <dig> at the organ level. tlr <dig> and rage receptors are found in the urothelium  <cit>  and sacral drgs  <cit>  also contain tlr <dig> and rage although whether they innervate the bladder is not known. intravesical pretreatment with tlr <dig> antagonist prevented hypersensitivity caused by disulfide hmgb <dig> while rage antagonist did not. taken together, these findings indicate that tlr <dig> receptors at the organ level are responsible for the abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity induced by bladder infusion of disulfide hmgb <dig> 

our results also indicate that rage receptors modulate the effects of intravesical infusion of hmgb <dig> by acting not at the organ  but possibly at the central nervous system level, since systemic administration was effective in blocking abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity. this agrees with the observation by tanaka, et al.  <cit>  that systemic administration of an antibody to hmgb <dig> or a rage inhibitor blocked cyclophosphamide- induced bladder pain. in contrast, we show that a systemic tlr <dig> antagonist administered systemically prevented disulfide hmgb1-induced bladder pain while tanaka reported that a systemic tlr <dig> inhibitor had no effect on cyp-induced bladder pain  <cit> . this discrepancy may be due to the different method used to elicit bladder pain. disulfide hmgb <dig> resulted in only minimal histological changes in the bladder while cyp is a strong chemical irritant that results in severe inflammation and hemorraghic cystitis  <cit> .

pbs/ic is a condition characterized by bladder pain , frequency and urgency with unclear etiology  <cit>  and in the absence of obvious bladder pathology  <cit> . our current findings showed that disulfide hmgb <dig> elicited pain may account for bladder pain observed in the absence of inflammation. we realize that our model using intravesical infusion of substances  at doses that cause pain without accompanying micturition or inflammation changes, focus only on one aspect of pbs/ic, namely pain, without addressing increased frequency and urgency commonly seen in pbs/ic. still these rodent models are useful because they are capable of eliciting bladder pain as a primary effect and not secondary to significant injury and inflammation. as such, they are useful tools in investigating the physiology of bladder pain in health and disease.

it is possible that urine proteases, already elevated in pbs/ic patients, activate urothelial par <dig> receptors to release mif into the urine  <cit> . mif, in turn, activates urothelial mif receptors to elicit hmgb <dig> release. oxidation of hmgb <dig> in the extracellular space  <cit>  or in the urine results in disulfide hmgb <dig> that binds to either urothelial tlr <dig> receptors to induce further signaling resulting in bladder pain or may bind directly to the mucosa or possible to elicit bladder pain . this schema remains to be validated in the clinical condition in future studies.fig.  <dig> role of hmgb <dig> in par <dig> induced bladder pain. activation of par <dig> receptors on urothelial cells elicits release of urothelial macrophage migration inhibitory factor . mif binds to urothelial mif receptors  to mediate release of urothelial hmgb <dig>  disulfide hmgb <dig>  may bind to tlr <dig> receptors in urothelium and/or nerve terminal innervating the bladder to mediate bladder pain




CONCLUSIONS
we previously showed that activation of urothelial par <dig> receptors results in release of mif and hmgb <dig> increasing abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity without bladder inflammation. we now report that hmgb <dig> infused directly into the bladder is capable to elicit mechanical hypersensitivity and this effect is produced by the disulfide isoform of hmgb <dig>  lastly, this effect is mediated by tlr <dig> receptors in the bladder and can also be modulated by systemic  rage receptors. neutralizing bladder mif, mif receptors, hmgb <dig> or antagonism of bladder tlr <dig> or systemic rage receptors may be potential specific and localized targets for bladder pain relief.
