BACKGROUND
chromatin organization in eukaryotic cells is associated with patterns of transcriptional activity and genomic stability . within the past decade, the development and diverse adaptations of the chromosome conformation capture  technology  <cit>  have unraveled the organization of chromatin in multiple cell types and organisms, advancing our understanding of chromosome structure at different length-scales .

all 3c technologies use cross-linked chromatin to identify genomic interactions in the nuclear space, providing estimates of the frequency of contacts of specific regions with the rest of the genome . among the 3c-derived methodologies, the circular 3c  technology was developed to target specific chromosomal regions  and identify their intra- and inter-chromosomal contacts   <cit> . current 4c protocols use next-generation sequencing for the identification of captures   <cit> , and have been recently combined with paired-end sequencing  to enable allele-specific identification of chromatin contacts through genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms   <cit> . initial 4c analysis strategies identified significant viewpoint-capture interactions by running windowed statistical approaches to test whether the number of contacts was greater than expected against empirically computed background contact profiles . other 4c analysis approaches have used power-law fits  <cit>  or variance-stabilization with monotonous fits  <cit>  to normalize the data and estimate background contact probabilities against which significant chromatin contacts are identified .

however, chromatin fibers can be modeled as a polymer, i.e., “beads-on-a-string”, with nucleosomes as beads, and linker dna as the string. polymer entropy, or the random thermal exploration of all the spatial configurations of a polymer, can dictate the expectation of contact probabilities for a chromatin region. this probability of entropy-driven random contacts has been well-characterized in the polymer physics literature, and has been described as a power-law fall off of interactions between chromatin fragments with increasing genomic separation  <cit> . this behavior has been clearly observed in 4c and hi-c experiments  <cit> .

we developed a novel quantitative framework for the analysis of multi-viewpoint pe-4cseq data firmly grounded on polymer physics. our pipeline corrects for pe-4cseq data biases, normalizes data, and computes the contact probability between a viewpoint fragment and all other fragments in the chromosome, allowing the quantitative testing of differences in chromatin contacts and chromatin compaction. in particular, this method is especially suited for the analysis of complex chromosome modifications such as copy number variants . we applied this new approach to study chromatin interactions within and around a  <dig>  mb engineered deletion in mouse region 4e <dig>  <cit> , which is orthologous to human 1p <dig>  <cit> . allele-specific pe-4cseq experiments of deletion and wild-type  chromosomes revealed several local and long-range differentially interacting regions  in the deletion-containing chromosome , as well as marked chromatin decompaction detected downstream of the deletion position. dirs were enriched in differentially expressed  genes as detected by rna-seq, as well as ctcf and smc <dig> binding sites, proteins that had been previously characterized as structural determinants of chromatin organization .

collectively, our work demonstrates the successful development and application of a quantitative pe-4cseq analysis pipeline, and illustrates for the first time the complex and diverse effects of a dna deletion on both the local and global signatures of chromatin organization and gene expression.

RESULTS
general framework for the quantitative analysis of pe-4cseq data
when chromatin is modeled as a polymer, pe-4cseq experiments provide the probability of each viewpoint fragment contacting any other fragment within the same chromosome; we call these frequencies the intra-chromosomal contact probability profile  of the viewpoint . chromatin polymer analysis offers a major advantage compared to purely statistical approaches to identifying differential interactions upon the occurrence of dna deletions; because in order to quantify the biological effects of a large-scale deletion on chromatin contacts, the expected changes in interaction of purely physical origin need to be distinguished from those of biological origin. physical contributions include increased interactions between genomic regions newly proximal in the deletion chromosome— two proximal segments will interact more frequently compared to their wt counterparts owing to polymer entropy and not for any novel biological mechanisms . biological contributions, on the other hand, may originate from changes in gene regulatory contacts, interactions mediated by chromatin architectural proteins, among others . existing statistical-analysis methods are not designed for such discrimination because the null expectation of signal is set by sequencing technology considerations alone and not by a polymer model which incorporates the physical effects systematically.fig.  <dig> study of chromatin contacts with polymer physics and key analysis phases. a

we designed a pipeline optimized for bias-correction, data normalization, and quantitative comparisons in multi-viewpoint pe-4cseq data. the pipeline provides an optimal estimate of cpp from the biased and noisy measurements in pe-4cseq experiments. these cpps include both background non-specific interactions between a viewpoint and any other region , and the specific interactions that have a biological origin. cpp signal differences are key in drawing meaningful conclusions on distinct control and test experimental conditions.

we set the null expectation, of entirely entropic origin, for each viewpoint’s cpp using a generalized gaussian “beads-on-a-string” polymer model of chromatin . in this model, 4c viewpoints which are neighbors along the chromatin fiber  are connected by gaussian springs with spring constants ki,i +  <dig>  these spring constants are a measure of the strength of tethering of one chromatin fragment to another mediated by the intervening chromatin fiber, and exhibit a power-law scaling for intermediate genomic separations . the cpp, represented by pij, has the scaling form pij∼sijνi, where sij is the genomic separation between viewpoint positions i and j, and νi is the local scaling exponent. the cpp typically falls off with increasing genomic separation of interacting fragments—entropic interactions between distal fragments are rare—therefore νi is always negative. different polymer models of chromatin have different scaling. for example, random-walk  chromatin polymers exhibit a uniform scaling exponent ν=− <dig>  while hi-c data analysis has shown that most eukaryotic chromatin is on average more compact  leading to the hypothesis of a non-equilibrium  model of chromatin  <cit> . we used νi as a measure of viewpoint-specific chromatin compaction and its variability upon deletion occurrence, as presented below.

this new data analysis pipeline comprises the following key phases:

phase 1: bias correction
the ideal output from any pe-4cseq measurement is the cpp of the chromatin polymer. however, several biases corrupt the straightforward measurement of the interaction profile. numerous biases have been reported in previous hi-c and 4cseq data analyses, and these include genomic restriction fragment lengths, fragment gc content, and amplification primer efficiencies  <cit> . the second class of bias is specific to multi-viewpoint 4c experiments and originates from variability in viewpoint sample preparation and sequencing amplification steps.

we removed biases without modeling them individually by their technical or biological sources. we first normalized the capture data for each experiment by the product of viewpoint and fragment lengths, and call this the biased contact probability  . this normalization corrects for the bias that a longer polymer fragment has more contacts directly proportional to its length. we modeled the bcp between two viewpoints as fij = cicjkipij, where ci and cj are the overall bias factors corresponding to the  viewpoint sequences, ki is the overall bias factor for the capture experiment of viewpoint i, and pij is the average cpp for viewpoints i and j. similarly, for the experiment corresponding to viewpoint j, the normalized capture data is fji = cicjkjpij; from these equations, note that only the experiment bias factor kj is distinct. we then solved the linear set of equations  to compute the bias factors c and k from fij and fji. the unbiased estimate of the contact probability, pij, should be symmetric for both i and j viewpoints. we performed this bias correction using only nearest and next-nearest-neighbor viewpoint pairs, and observed that biases for all other viewpoint pairs are significantly reduced and pij is very close to being symmetric, whereas fij is clearly not , attesting to the consistency of bias correction. given that the bias modeling introduces 2n parameters for n viewpoints, there are at most n observable fij. therefore, at least four viewpoints to perform bias correction analyses are needed.

phase 2: computation of a smoothed cpp
we used the bias factors to estimate the unbiased cpp per viewpoint and for all their contacting intra-chromosomal fragments  . the cpp for viewpoint i and fragment α is defined as piα=fiαciki, where fiα is the bcp, ci is the overall viewpoint i bias factor, and ki is the bias factor for the pe-4cseq experiment of viewpoint i. once the raw cpp per viewpoint was obtained, we thresholded and smoothed it using a gaussian kernel of standard-deviation  <dig> kb  for whole chromosome contact comparisons. the  <dig> kb standard deviation is in the upper range of viewpoint sizes  in our experiments, and is the genomic resolution of the pe-4cseq measurements.

phase 3: discovering differentially interacting regions 
the smoothed cpp per viewpoint was used to compute the differential relative contact probability  signals, defined as /log pwt, between df and + dbl <dig>  chromosomes relative to the wt cpps for + <dig> and + bl <dig> in two biological replicates . in order to reduce poisson noise in mapped read-counts we only considered captured fragment read counts greater than a threshold . we added a pseudo-count of  <dig> to all viewpoint-fragment pairs so that missing data does not lead to false drcp signals. we analyzed the statistical significance of all drcp signals at a level of > =5 % interaction probability differences as follows: we first considered a window bracketing the location of each drcp, with a window size equal to the size of the gaussian smoothing filter . the raw cpp data from del and wt viewpoints were subjected to the mann–whitney u test at each window, to check whether their difference was statistically significant . we performed this testing independently for the two biological replicates, and reported drcps only when they were present  in both replicates. the regions of the chromosome with significant drcp signals were catalogued as differentially interacting regions .

phase  <dig>  measurement of local chromatin compaction
we characterized local chromatin compaction for the chromosomes in df/+ dbl <dig> and +129/+bl <dig> by fitting a smoothing spline to the logarithm of contact probability against the logarithm of genomic separation. the slope of this curve at  <dig> kb defines our local scaling exponent νi for viewpoint i and is a local measure of chromatin compaction. the length scale of 100 kb is chosen by observation of the data-rich linear region of the cpp fall-off . within this range, topologically associating domains  have been discovered  <cit> , and our analysis reveals possible changes in higher-order chromatin organization upon the occurrence of a deletion or any other cnv, testable by additional experiments such as 3d dna fish .

the development of a pipeline grounded in polymer physics for the analysis of multi-viewpoint pe-4cseq data is an important contribution to those surveying chromatin conformation under diverse experimental conditions, including cnvs. in the next sections, we apply this pipeline to the investigation of chromatin organization upon a  <dig>  mb deletion in mouse 4e <dig>  and offer an integrative picture of the effects of a large-scale chromatin deletion on chromosome conformation and transcriptional output.

allele-specific regions of differential contact probabilities in df/ + dbl <dig> mefs
4e <dig> is a gene-rich region in mouse orthologous to human 1p <dig> . 1p <dig> is an interesting genomic region where heterozygous deletions of different sizes are often present in a wide variety of cancers  <cit>  and can originate a mental retardation syndrome known as monosomy 1p <dig>  <cit> . given the importance of 1p <dig> deletion cnvs in humans, we decided to study a chromosome-engineered mouse model harboring a  <dig>  mb deletion in 4e <dig>  <cit> .fig.  <dig> 4e <dig> and 1p <dig> orthologous regions, and engineered mouse models used. a human 1p36-p <dig>  and mouse 4c5-e <dig> bands are orthologous . 1p <dig> and 4e <dig> are shown in dashed rectangles in their respective orthologous chromosome segments . the  <dig>  mb deletion region inside mouse e <dig> is the focus of this study . b first generation  df/dp male chimeras engineered in 129s5/svevbrd es cells were mated with wt c57bl/6 j females to obtain heterozygote f <dig> df/+ dbl <dig> progeny. c

we investigated chromatin organization in the heterozygous f <dig> genotype df/+ dbl <dig>  df is the chromosome  <dig> from the 129s5/svevbrd mouse strain with an engineered  <dig>  mb deletion in 4e <dig>  <cit>  . + dbl <dig> denotes a wt c57bl6/j chromosome  <dig> copy. chromosomes derived from the 129s5/svevbrd and c57bl6/j mouse strains can be easily distinguished through genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms   <cit> , therefore, allele-specific analyses of 4e <dig> chromatin contacts are feasible by pe-4cseq in df/ + dbl <dig> and their corresponding +129/+bl <dig> wt controls . the study of heterozygote genotypes allowed us to investigate the architectural consequences of the deletion chromosome in direct comparison to its wt counterpart.

mouse embryonic fibroblasts  were derived from f <dig> df/+ dbl <dig> mice, as well as +129/+bl <dig> controls. a total of  <dig> viewpoints spanning 4e <dig> were selected , and the presence of reported snps  <cit>  validated by sanger sequencing . all viewpoints were amplified from two biological replicates of df/+ dbl <dig> and +129/+bl <dig> mefs, and reads trimmed and mapped against a reduced hindiii restriction fragment database . we concentrated our analysis on viewpoints located outside of the deleted region  , as they allowed us to directly interrogate the consequences of a dna deletion on local and long-range chromatin interactions. however, dir analysis of viewpoints within the deletion region in wt chromosomes was also performed, and both df and wt dir data are available through geo series accession number gse <dig> .

there are  <dig> dirs detected for viewpoints  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in df when compared against + <dig> . these dirs add up to ~34 mb  of chromosome  <dig> sequence, have a minimum size of  <dig> kb, a median size of  <dig> kb, and a maximal size of  <dig>  mb. the changes observed for viewpoints  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mostly involve increases in interaction with surrounding sequences; viewpoint  <dig> displays a decrease in contact probabilities for their identified dirs . as can be seen in the top panel of additional file 1: figure s <dig>  df dirs are scattered along chromosome  <dig>  with the majority of the dirs neighboring the deletion.fig.  <dig>

we also performed the reciprocal + dbl <dig> and + bl <dig> wt comparison in order to assess the level of uniqueness of df dirs, and to test whether the  <dig>  mb deletion in df had a trans influence on the chromatin contacts of its wt counterpart. analysis of viewpoints  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> revealed a total of  <dig> dirs between + dbl <dig> and + bl <dig> chromosomes , and their sequences add up to ~15 mb . + dbl <dig> dirs tend to be smaller compared to df dirs, and have a minimum size of  <dig> kb, a median size of  <dig> kb, and a maximal size of  <dig> kb. the changes observed for these viewpoints mostly involve increases in contact probabilities . similar to df dirs, + dbl <dig> dirs are scattered along chromosome  <dig>  with the highest number present surrounding the deletion . there are  <dig> df dirs that intersect with + dbl <dig> dirs, covering ~9 mb of chromosome  <dig> sequence  . the high overlap ratios between df and + dbl <dig> dirs suggests the existence of trans mechanisms of chromatin architecture regulation common to both chromosome  <dig> homologues which are affected after the occurrence of the  <dig>  mb 4e <dig> deletion. in order to query the dirs segments which are unique to df, we eliminated the genomic regions where the df and + dbl <dig> dirs overlap. there are  <dig> unique df dir segments covering ~12 mb  with a median size of  <dig>  kb and maximal size of  <dig>  mb . similarly, there exist  <dig> dir segments that are unique to + dbl <dig>  covering ~3 mb of sequence  with a median size of  <dig> kb and a maximal size of  <dig> kb .

a number of 3c and hi-c studies have implicated various proteins as structural determinants of the 3d organization of the mammalian genome. ctcf and cohesin have been shown to be boundary proteins between tads, while mediator complex plays important roles in loop formation for correct gene activation . we used previously published ctcf, med <dig>  med <dig>  and smc <dig> mef binding datasets  <cit>  to query the overlap between structural protein binding sites and dir positions. we first estimated the density of structural protein binding sites at the resolution matching the dir signal resolution . reassuringly, we observed that several dirs align with regions dense in binding sites in a whole chromosome view . using random sampling of all structural protein binding sequences along chromosome  <dig>  we observed that df and + dbl <dig> dirs are enriched in ctcf and smc <dig> binding sites  . these observations suggest that alterations observed in the contact probability of dirs could be mediated by ctcf and smc <dig>  and their binding may be affected by differential expression or by other chromatin remodeling genes in df/+ dbl <dig> mefs .

altogether, the presented dir data indicate the large amount of chromatin contact variation arising after the occurrence of a  <dig>  mb dna deletion in mouse 4e <dig>  up to 22 % of chromosome  <dig> sequence is catalogued as dirs with > 5 % changes in contact probability between df and + <dig> chromosomes; interestingly, this extensive network of chromatin contact changes was identified by analyzing the intra-chromosomal contacts of only  <dig> viewpoints surrounding the deletion. the identification of df-shared + dbl <dig> dirs suggests that trans alterations in chromatin interactions occur in df/+ dbl <dig> mefs, which extend along the chromosome  <dig> sequence and could be mediated by ctcf and smc <dig> protein binding or additional chromatin remodelers .

changes in local chromatin compaction in the df chromosome
each viewpoint’s contact probability falls off with increasing genomic separation, pij∼sijνi, where sij is the genomic separation between viewpoint positions i and j, and νi is the local scaling exponent. more compact chromatin regions have higher νi values, while less compact zones have smaller νi’s. in addition to the identification of chromatin contact differences computed at the  <dig> kb scale, our pipeline characterizes νi, a signature of higher-order chromatin organization at intermediate length scales .

we asked whether the scaling exponent νivaries for each viewpoint i in df/+ dbl <dig> mefs. overall, considerable variation was observed between the scaling exponents for the  <dig> viewpoints along the + dbl <dig> chromosome, in agreement with observed qualitative variation in local compaction in hi-c data heatmaps  <cit> . significant differences in νi values are observed for viewpoints  <dig> and  <dig> in the df chromosome, which are less compact than expected upon deletion . interestingly, comparison of νi values between + dbl <dig> and + bl <dig> viewpoints also revealed compaction differences for these viewpoints, however their differences are not as dramatic as seen in df . notably,  <dig> viewpoints inside the deletion region in + dbl <dig> also displayed significant differences in their νi values. these observations suggest that the trans effects of the deletion in chromatin contact differences are also reflected on higher-order chromosome structure in both df and + dbl <dig> chromosomes, and these may be caused by either changes in gene expression or by physical factors affecting chromosome organization in df/+ dbl <dig> mefs.fig.  <dig> computed ν per viewpoint. a
ν values were computed for each viewpoint in df  vs. the average of + bl <dig>  + <dig> and + dbl <dig>  chromosomes, with error bars determined from the two biological replicates. values of ν < − 3/ <dig> corresponds to less compact state than expected from gaussian behavior, whereas ν > − 3/ <dig> corresponds to more compact states. notice the decrease in overall compaction for df and most significantly at the telomeric end. b contact probability fall-off for viewpoint  <dig> is shown for df and  wt values



viewpoints  <dig> and  <dig> reside near the telomere of chromosome  <dig>  given the significant decrease in compaction for these viewpoints in df compared to + dbl <dig>  a possible explanation is that the observed df decompaction is a direct consequence of the physical deletion of a chromosome fragment. we hypothesized that tethering points bordering the deletion region may cause the telomeric end and adjacent upstream sequences to remain in their original preferred positions, subsequently stretching the intervening sequence after deletion. such tethering points could be lamina-associated domains , important features of nuclear architecture and genomic regulation  <cit> . analysis of published lad positions identified in 3 t <dig> mefs  <cit>  revealed the presence of only lad-free regions bordering the deletion  . however,  <dig> lads exist within a  <dig>  mb segment inside the deletion sequence . intriguingly, it is within this segment where the  <dig> viewpoints inside the deletion region in + dbl <dig> also displayed significant differences in chromatin compaction . it is therefore possible that the deletion of tethering points within the deletion region in df chromosomes allows for chromatin to be less compact.

validation of changes in chromatin interactions by 3d dna fish
after the identification of dirs and the observed chromatin decompaction in df chromosomes using our pipeline, we sought to validate these results using 3d dna fluorescence in situ hybridization . 3d dna fish experiments provide direct measurements of physical distances separating any pair of genomic loci inside the nucleus, which can be used to estimate their contact frequencies . this allows the assessment of whether dirs were actually present in df and wt chromosomes, and the quantitation of interaction changes at the single cell level in comparison to pe-4cseq results.

3d dna fish experiments were performed using two different fluorescently labeled bacterial artificial chromosome  probes overlapping dir positions , with a third bac probe inside the deletion region  . the deletion probe was used to distinguish the df chromosome, and its location is identical for all experiments. four representative df regions were selected for analysis by 3d dna fish: three of these regions were classified as dirs, some of which exhibited chromatin decompaction , while the fourth region  tested a specific interacting pair observed in our pe-4cseq data not classified as a dir but enriched in ctcf and smc <dig> binding sites . over a hundred nuclei were analyzed per 3d dna fish experiment, and query probe distances were measured in df/+ dbl <dig> and +129/+bl <dig> mefs.fig.  <dig> 3d dna fish validations of pe-4cseq data. a 3d dna fish strategy used. green and red triangles represent query probes along the chromatin fiber separated at fixed distances. the white triangle represents the deletion probe. red/green probes can also be located bordering the deletion probe. the df chromosome is distinguished by the absence of the deletion probe, as shown in the nuclear representations of df/+ dbl <dig> and +129/+bl <dig> genotypes. b projection of a 3d dna fish image for control bacset <dig> using df/+ dbl <dig> mefs. red and green probes are the query probes, while white probe is the deletion probe. hybridization images are zoomed inside white rectangles. note the absence of the deletion probe for one of the chromosomes, classified as df with our algorithm . c representative 3d dna fish image projections for +129/+bl <dig> and df/+ dbl <dig> nuclei for bacset <dig> probes. probe colors are as described in b. df chromosome probes are shown inside the white dashed rectangle, and wt probes shown in rectangle. d query probe distance distributions for bacset <dig>  for both +129/+bl <dig> chromosomes  and df . the black line indicates the model fit to the probability mass function . notice the increase in typical spatial separations as well as a broader distribution in df, in agreement with the observed decrease in contact probabilities in pe-4cseq. e rainbow plot of the zoomed in region near the deletion in df chromosome. enrichment and depletion of long-range interactions are color coded as in fig.  <dig>  the black arrows represent viewpoint positions; dashed box of the chromosome bar is the deletion region; the three distinct colored boxes are the three query probe pairs, also identified by numbers; the dashed rectangle inside the deletion region is the deletion probe. the dashed triangles represent query probe interaction changes as detected from fish experiments, with enrichment in red and depletion in blue with associated proportional changes in interaction reported as percentages. notice the agreement between enrichment  and depletion  between pe-4cseq and dna fish interactions



our analysis identified a qualitative agreement between the contact changes in dirs derived from pe-cseq and the changes in spring constant for 3d dna fish experiments . query probes from fish experiments testing dirs with a decrease in contact probability and chromatin decompaction  exhibited larger separation distances compared to + <dig> measurements . similarly, query probes with a reported pe-4cseq increase in contact probabilities  displayed smaller 3d fish physical separation distances compared to + <dig> measurements . our control fish experiment  displayed a much narrower and almost identical distribution of distances between query probes in both wt  and deletion  chromosomes compared to the expectation for similar genomic separation . this is indicative of pronounced long-range interactions between these two regions, in agreement with the peak in contact probability observed in our pe-4cseq data. given the enrichment of ctcf and smc <dig> protein binding sites at these regions, it is possible that such stable contacts may be mediated by these proteins. taken together, 3d dna fish results validate our pe-4cseq analysis framework, and point to bona fide changes in contact probabilities arising after the occurrence of a  <dig>  mb deletion in mouse chromosome  <dig> 

impact of chromatin conformation changes on 4e <dig> gene expression
cnvs are known to affect expression patterns of distal and neighboring genes . some of these effects may arise through changes in chromosome conformation: at the chromatin level, cnvs can potentially disrupt associations of gene promoters and their regulatory elements, affect topologically associating domain  boundaries  <cit> , and/or join differentially regulated regions. to assess the potential impact of dirs on df/+ dbl <dig> gene expression, we analyzed the transcriptome of df/+ dbl <dig> mefs through rna sequencing  .

df/+ dbl <dig> and +129/+bl <dig> mefs rna-seq experiments revealed  <dig> differentially expressed  genes between both genotypes .  <dig> of these are chromosome  <dig> genes, a higher number than expected by chance . enrichment analysis revealed 4e <dig> and 4e as the cytogenetic bands with the most significant de clustering locations in df/+ dbl <dig> mefs . interestingly, the 4d region, directly upstream of 4e, was the next most significant de clustering location in the genome . 34 % of de genes in chromosome  <dig> are contained within df dirs, and 24 % of de genes are contained within + dbl <dig> dirs . both df and + dbl <dig> dirs and de combined genes overlap ratios are significant  . very interestingly, ctcf gene expression is increased in df/+ dbl6mefs . similarly, gene ontology  analysis into cellular function for df/+ dbl6mefs revealed  <dig> genes associated with “condensed nuclear chromosome” .fig.  <dig> 
a log2fold ratios  and their corresponding average of normalized counts  for all de genes between df/+bl <dig> and +129/+bl <dig> mefs. positive values indicate higher expression in +129/+bl <dig> mefs, while negative values indicate higher expression in df/+bl <dig> mefs. shown in red are all the de genes present on chromosome  <dig>  b log2fold ratios for de 129s5/svevbrd alleles  and de c57bl6/j alleles  in df/+bl <dig> mefs. notice the high degree of correlation between the allelic log2fold changes when compared to a perfect correlation score . genes shown in red fall within the deletion sequence, and therefore display a different behavior compared to other alleles



given our use of a 129s5/svevbrd and c57bl6/j heterozygote genetic background, we were able to perform allele-specific expression analysis in df/+ dbl <dig> mefs. we detected  <dig> de 129s5/svevbrd alleles,  <dig> of them in chromosome  <dig> . in addition,  <dig> de c57bl6/j alleles were detected, with  <dig> located in chromosome  <dig> .  <dig> de alleles are shared between the 129s5/svevbrd and c57bl6/j alleles,  <dig> of them inside the deletion position. both allelic de sets cluster in the 4e <dig> and 4e region , where the deletion resides. interestingly, despite the elimination of only the 129s5/svevbrd allele inside the deletion region,  <dig> de genes located in diverse genomic regions along all mouse chromosomes were mis-regulated at both alleles, and their allelic fold changes were highly correlated , with the exception of the deleted genes located inside the deletion region, which exhibit a higher fold change for the 129s5/svevbrd allele only . this observation is indicative of trans effects in transcription, where mrna levels are regulated similarly between alleles. this phenomenon is reminiscent of the trans effects on chromatin contacts observed for the + dbl <dig> chromosome in df/+ dbl <dig> mefs. in fact, 18 % of the c57bl6/j de alleles on chromosome  <dig> are contained within + dbl <dig> dirs . whether trans effects in gene expression induce the appearance of dirs in the + dbl <dig> chromosome, or vice versa, remains to be tested in future experiments .

discussion
previous 4c-seq analysis methodologies have been based on various statistical models . here, we have developed a pipeline based on polymer physics specifically targeted for analyzing 4c sequencing experiments . we have shown that this polymer physics based pipeline accurately quantifies changes in chromatin interaction between distinct 4c experiments; importantly, the pipeline can be used not only to analyze allelic chromatin interactions through pe sequencing, but also perform standard interaction analyses using single end sequencing on 4c-seq experiments. the pipeline corrects for intrinsic biases in 4c sequencing data, normalizes captures, and extracts the contact probability profiles  of multiple viewpoints to perform quantitative comparisons between different samples.

compared to statistical methods, our analysis pipeline utilizes a minimal number of  <dig> viewpoints for data normalization. therefore, it can be extended to the analysis of hi-c data  <cit> , where every restriction fragment in the genome acts as a viewpoint . analyzing a number of 4c viewpoints systematically is a cheaper alternative to genome-wide  experiments; we showed that our pipeline can quantify signatures of higher-order chromosome organization similar to hi-c, but in an allele-specific manner.

the newly developed pipeline is especially suited for the analysis of chromatin interaction changes upon copy number variation. cnvs can alter chromosome structure by introducing additional large pieces of dna into specific regions , or by positioning two different chromatin regions near to each other . therefore, it is important to distinguish interactions that arise from a clear biological source, from those originated by polymer entropy. since we explicitly constructed a null model of chromatin cpp, we were able to distinguish specific interactions not explained by altered genomic proximity upon dna deletion.

to test the utility of this new pipeline, we studied the changes in chromatin organization occurring upon the deletion of a  <dig>  mb segment of mouse chromosome region 4e <dig>  the mouse 4e <dig> chromosome band is a particularly interesting region as it is orthologous to human 1p <dig>  where heterozygous deletions are recurrent in cancer  <cit>  and originate a mental retardation syndrome   <cit> . to our knowledge, this is the first study of the effects on chromatin architecture of a recurrent human cnv modeled in mouse.

using allele-specific pe-4cseq experiments on heterozygote deletion/wt  mefs, we uncovered extensive changes in local and long-range chromatin interactions occurring upon the  <dig>  mb deletion in 4e <dig>  up to 22 % of chromosome  <dig> sequence in df, and ~10 % of sequence in + dbl <dig> are engaged in altered intra-chromosomal contacts  as revealed through the analysis of  <dig> viewpoints bordering the deletion. ~9 mb of sequence is shared between df and + dbl <dig> dirs, implying that the  <dig>  mb deletion was not affecting df chromatin conformation alone, but also + dbl <dig> by trans mechanisms. interestingly, both df and + dbl <dig> dirs are enriched for ctcf and smc <dig> binding; these proteins have been previously identified as structural determinants of chromosome structure . while unique df dirs may be a direct consequence of the alteration of preferred chromatin conformation in the 4e <dig> region, future studies are needed to determine how cis and trans effects in chromatin organization are derived. possible causes may be due to changes in the transcriptome owing to the deletion of genes inside the deletion. it is noteworthy to mention that gene expression analysis through rna-seq revealed an upregulation in ctcf and other chromosome condensation genes in df/+ dbl <dig> mefs compared to +129/+bl <dig>  the increased expression of these proteins in df/+ dbl <dig> mefs could have important consequences in chromosome architecture for this genotype, and directly participate in dir formation in cis and trans. future chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments would be able to test this hypothesis.

a surprising reduction of local chromatin compaction was identified for viewpoints located near the telomeric end of the df chromosome. this result points to a new higher-order architectural change upon the occurrence of the  <dig>  mb deletion affecting over 1 mb of the terminal part of df. additional experiments will test the hypothesis of whether chromatin tethering points exist within or neighboring the deletion region , which could cause the intervening chromatin to extend upon the occurrence of the  <dig>  mb deletion. we verified a select few df dirs as well as a chromatin decompaction region through 3d dna fish. notably, we found a strong agreement between the strengths and direction of change for both experimental modalities, thus validating our pe-4cseq analysis pipeline and demonstrating the existence of chromatin reorganization upon the occurrence of the deletion in df.

altered gene expression, as measured by rna-seq, was observed for a significant number of genes falling within or flanking df and + dbl <dig> dirs. interestingly, there is a high genome-wide correlation between allelic fold expression changes for the non-deleted alleles. while it is possible that chromatin interaction changes may be responsible for the altered expression of these genes, deriving associations between gene expression and chromatin conformation in a dna deletion context is not easily attained.

future studies of chromatin architecture in deletion/duplication model systems will be essential to expand our understanding of human disorders linked to the presence of cnvs or other genomic rearrangements such as balanced chromosome translocations. the df/+ dbl <dig> mouse genotype can be a model of heterozygous monosomy 1p <dig> deletions in human. such deletions frequently occur de novo and tend to have different sizes and positions . interestingly, a case of two individuals presenting similar clinical features and different deletion sizes and positions was reported  <cit> , which suggests that monosomy 1p <dig> could be a syndrome where deletions could have positional effects in addition to altering gene dosage. examining various monosomy 1p <dig> candidate genes , we discovered that most of their mouse orthologues fall within df/+ dbl <dig> dirs. one such genes, endothelin-converting enzyme  <dig>   <cit> , 12 mb upstream of the deletion region, is included in a df dir with a 30–40 % decrease in contact probability, and its expression is decreased in df/+ dbl <dig> mefs. it is tempting to speculate that ece <dig> could be a candidate gene for which positional long-range effects on deletion alter gene expression, leading to phenotypic consequences in monosomy 1p <dig> patients. however, this hypothesis remains to be tested.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the development and validation of a new pe-4cseq analysis framework based on polymer physics has revealed the extensive impact of a  <dig>  mb deletion in mouse chromosome  <dig> on local and global chromatin organization and gene expression. future studies will assess deletions or duplications in other regions of the genome to determine if similar or different effects on gene expression and nuclear organization occur. such studies will shed more light on the complex interplay between gene expression, chromosome structure and genomic rearrangements, and their impact on disease states.
