BACKGROUND
malaria is one of the most important infectious diseases in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, causing millions of deaths in developing countries every year  <cit> . the most severe agent of human malaria is plasmodium falciparum, whose virulence is largely due to the capability of infected erythrocytes to adhere to host cell receptors and avoid splenic clearance  <cit> . once the parasite enters a host erythrocyte, the cell undergoes a series of important modifications, one of which is the insertion of parasite proteins into the erythrocyte membrane to form knob-like structures. knobs play a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of the disease. these structures are responsible for sequestration within the micro-vasculature of vital organs such as the brain  and for the rosetting process that are related to severe forms of malaria  <cit> .

the most studied knob-associated protein is the erythrocyte membrane protein- <dig> , which is directly involved in the interactions between infected erythrocytes and host cell receptors. var genes encoding pfemp <dig> proteins are present in 50- <dig> copies in the parasite genome and are predominantly located in the subtelomeric regions of all  <dig> chromosomes  <cit> . pfemp <dig> proteins are the main component of the variant surface antigens  that are responsible for the antigenic variation of the parasites. the expression of novel variants of these proteins at the surface of infected erythrocytes allows the parasite to evade the immune system and hence to proliferate in the human host  <cit> . in addition, it was demonstrated that their subtelomeric localisation promotes the continuous generation of new repertoires of proteins with new antigenic and adhesive properties  <cit> . in fact, frequent recombinations followed by duplication and gene conversion events lead to a reshuffling of subtelomeric regions which appear as a mosaic of sequences.

linked to var genes at subtelomeres are members of the multigene family rifin/stevor  <cit> . although sequence similarity reveals a common ancestor for stevors and rifins, recent studies of stevor transcription and expression show that they are distinct from the rifin multigene family, suggesting a different role for members of the two families  <cit> .

rifin genes form the most abundant multigene family in p. falciparum with about  <dig> copies in the 3d <dig> genome. it has been shown that rifins are targets for the human immune response and are part of the vsa contributing to the antigenic variability of the parasite  <cit> . rifins encode transmembrane proteins with a predicted size of about 30- <dig> kid. proteins can be grouped into two sub-families  as recognised on the basis of preliminary genome sequencing data by pizzi et al.  <cit>  and recently confirmed by joannin et al. on the complete repertoire of members  <cit> . apart from a short insertion  present only in rif_a, a similar overall architectural organization has been proposed for members of the two sub-families: a signal peptide at the n-terminus, a pexel/vts motif which is necessary to target proteins outside the parasite cell  <cit> , and two transmembrane domains. however, it has been recently shown that rif_as and rif_bs have different sub-cellular localisations and possibly different functions. rif_as are localised outside the parasite cell, while rif_bs remain confined within the parasitophorous vacuole . furthermore, rifin variants have different developmental expression in merozoites where members of the two sub-families remain within the parasite cell although exhibiting different localisation patterns  <cit> . evolutionary studies support these recent experimental data. mcinerney and colleagues  <cit>  showed that members of the rifin family are subject to different selective pressures, and suggested that this is due to their different exposure to the host immune system.

in this work, we present a study on the entire repertoire of rifins in genomes from three p. falciparum clones: 3d <dig>  hb <dig> and dd <dig>  each rifin gene in the three genomes was considered as an arrangement of three modules: 5' upstream sequences , coding sequences  and 3' downstream sequences . in order to carry out comparisons in each class of sequences, we used a multidimensional scaling  statistical method, which permits the study of relationships between sequences without any a priori assumptions as in the case of molecular evolutionary approaches. we found that rifin sequences  show a very similar cluster organisation in the three examined clones. we also proposed a classification of rifin genes based on the arrangement of the diverse type of module sequences and found that, despite the high expected variability, 3d <dig>  hb <dig> and dd <dig> share very similar repertoires of rifins. in the second part of the work, we submitted  <dig> bona fide rifin protein sequences from 3d <dig> to signal peptide and transmembrane predictors. notably, we found that while rif_bs have a signal peptide, a pexel/vts motif and two transmembrane domains, the great majority of rif_as do not have a signal peptide and contain only one transmembrane domain was predicted at the c-terminus. these results therefore indicate that the rif_a and rif_b proteins do not share the currently accepted common domain organisation proposed for this multigene family. on the other hand these results support the recent experimental data on different sub-cellular localisations and possible different functions of rif_as and rif_bs  <cit> .

finally, we constructed a 3d-model for rif_as with the aim of gaining insights into the domains potentially involved of rifins in host-parasite interactions. taking advantage of the large number of sequences we developed a strategy based on ab initio structure prediction by the i-tasser algorithm  <cit> .  <dig> possible models were predicted for a subset of  <dig> non-redundant sequences and then clustered according to their fold similarity by tm-align  <cit> . we found that the two most representative models obtained in this analysis resemble the "armadillo-like" fold.

RESULTS
multidimensional scaling  of rifin nucleotide sequences
in the 3d <dig> genome ,  <dig> predicted gene products are annotated as members of the rifin/stevor family  of which  <dig> are rifins. in order to select bona fide rifins, we discarded products of truncated variants and pseudogenes and considered only those from two-exon genes with good alignments to the pfam family profile . in this way we obtained a list of  <dig> protein sequences . in order to carry out a comparative analysis between rifin repertoires in different p. falciparum clones,  <dig> rifin/stevor proteins for hb <dig> and  <dig> for dd <dig> were downloaded from the broad institute . since for both genomes the annotation status is preliminary, we decided to use 3d <dig> bona fide rifins as a reference.

as standard matrices are not suited to compare proteins with biased amino acid compositions  <cit> , recently novel series of adjusted matrices have been constructed specifically for plasmodium proteins  <cit> . we used the ccf <dig> substitution matrix  <cit>  to align the protein sequences from different clones using blast . only proteins with a percent identity  higher than 30% and an e-value lower than 1e- <dig> were retained, which allowed us to discard uncertain rifin and stevor members.  <dig> and  <dig> rifin genes for hb <dig> and dd <dig> respectively were thus identified for analysis .

corresponding rifin gene sequences from three clones were considered and subdivided in three regions for analysis:  <dig> kb upstream the atg codon , the coding region  and  <dig> kb downstream the stop codon . we first performed needleman-wunsch alignments  <cit>  for all possible pairwise comparisons of rifin sequences from 3d <dig>  hb <dig> and dd <dig> and derived the percentage of identity between each pair of sequences. for each group of sequences , distance matrices were then constructed where d = 100-%id. we used these matrices as input for mds. mds is a statistical method which allows mapping of sequences as points on a plane in which euclidean distances reflect those in the matrices . this permits the identification of possible clusters of sequences and hence the study of their relationships.

mds on 3d <dig>  hb <dig> and dd <dig> upstream regions revealed  <dig> sequences scattered on the plane, distant from the cluster containing the majority of sequences. since the presence of outliers can interfere with the recognition of real clusters, we removed these sequences . when mds was then repeated sequences appear to be organised into three groups and a k-means clustering  was used to better define borders of clusters . clusters named ups_a, ups_b and ups_c contain  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> sequences respectively. also in the case of the other two clones, we found several outliers  which were removed before to repeat mds. in figure  <dig>  panels b and c, we report results for similar analysis of rifins in hb <dig> and dd <dig>  despite the expected high variability, a very similar cluster organisation was found in all the three clones.

also in the case of coding sequences several outliers were discarded . results for 3d <dig>  confirm that rifins are organised into two sub-families as previously described  <cit> . in accordance with classification proposed by joannin et al.  <cit>  we indicated the two groups of sequences cds_a and cds_b. cds_a correspond to  <dig> genes coding for rif_a which are characterised by the presence of a specific insert in protein products, while cds_b are genes coding for  <dig> members of the sub-family rif_b. the same organisation into two sub-families is maintained also in hb <dig>  and dd <dig> , although more scattered distributions of sequences are observed .

in the case of 3' downstream sequences of 3d <dig>  we did not find any outliers, and the sequences appear clearly clustered into two groups . in hb <dig> and dd <dig> only few outliers were removed  and mds showed the same cluster organisation obtained in 3d <dig> . this mds analysis has established that rifin gene sequences maintain a very similar cluster organisation in all three of the examined genomes. in addition, differences in the number of outliers for ups, cds and dwn sequences revealed that these regions evolve differently. in particular, the few outliers in dwn sequences  show that these regions are highly conserved among members of the multigene family.

rifin repertoires in 3d <dig>  hb <dig> and dd2
mds results described above allow a novel classification of rifin genes based on the arrangement of the diverse types of ups, cds and dwn modules. under the hypothesis that modules might occur independently of each other, the probability for a given combination is the product of the three frequencies at which ups, cds and dwn occur in the genome, that is f = f·f·f. we calculated the frequencies at which each of the  <dig> possible module arrangements are expected in a genome and compared them with the observed ones . we observed that rifin repertoires have highly similar gene distributions in 3d <dig>  hb <dig> and dd <dig>  furthermore, in the three genomes examined, these distributions strongly deviate from the random expectation . in particular, the most frequent combinations are baa, cbb and aaa which are significantly over-represented. the ratio between observed and expected frequencies of combinations baa and aaa is higher than  <dig>  in all the three genomes, and ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for combination cbb.

furthermore, accordingly to our novel classification, we examined the genomic localization of rifins in 3d <dig>  <cit> . we found that the most frequent rifin genes  are located in gene arrays proximal to subtelomeric ends and shared by several chromosomes. in particular, 12/ <dig> subtelomeres in the most distal regions share the array var/baa/pseudovar  and  indicate the orientation with respect to the telomere), while  <dig> out of  <dig> are characterized by the following arrangement var/baa/cbb. rifin cbb is often found associate with var pseudogenes and stevor gene in the array baa-pseudovar-stevor-cbb,  <dig> copies of this are found in several subtelomeres with little variation.

our analyses reveal that the overall organisation of rifin repertoires in different genomes is maintained. while any of the  <dig> possible combinations may potentially be present in a genome only three arrangements of gene sequences are found frequently in all the three examined clones. the most frequent of these arrangements occur in blocks in blocks of genes which are present in several copies in different subtelomeres.

secondary structure prediction of rifin proteins
the first description of the putative rifin structure predicted a signal peptide and two transmembrane helices on the basis of nine rifin sequences from chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . rifins of chromosome  <dig> were analysed by gardner and colleagues  <cit> , who predicted a highly conserved transmembrane domain at the c-terminus and an n-terminal signal peptide. no central transmembrane helix was identified in this work. on the other hand, analyses of a typical rifin sequence  <cit> , or of rifin sequence multiple alignment  <cit> , led to prediction of two transmembrane helices in rifin proteins. in order to clarify these controversial results we decided to carry out secondary structure predictions on each of the  <dig> bona fide 3d <dig> sequences.

in order to predict presence of signal peptide sequences in rifins we submitted the 3d <dig> rifin amino acid sequences to signalp  <dig>   <cit>  using both neural network  and hidden markov model  predictions. for each sequence the probability value to contain a signal peptide was considered alongside the most probable position for the cleavage site. we considered a hmm probability higher than 50% to be a reliable prediction for a signal peptide. the result of this analysis was that, surprisingly, while the majority of rif_bs   possess a signal peptide; about  <dig> %  of rif_as  do not.

in order to provide a reliable prediction of secondary structures for rifins, we submitted rif_as and rif_bs to conpredii, a consensus based method to predict transmembrane helices   <cit> . as expected from previous work, two transmembrane domains were predicted for  <dig> out of  <dig> rif_b . the two putative helices are located at positions 121aa ±  <dig> aa  and 292aa ± 27aa , both predicted to be  <dig> amino acids long. the wider range of positions for tm <dig> is due to the high variability in the length of the region between the two predicted transmembrane domains . while tm <dig> has a typical amino acid composition for a transmembrane helix, tm <dig> is enriched by glycine residues . interestingly, it has been demonstrated that glycines arranged in gxxxg patterns such as those found in rif_b tm <dig> promote homodimerisation interactions in transmembrane helices  <cit> . in fact, the spacing of three residues exposes the glycines on the same side of the helix, allowing very close contact between transmembrane domains and permitting extensive van der waals interactions  <cit> .

surprisingly, a different result was obtained for rif_as. 99/ <dig> rif_as have been predicted to contain only one tm, 12/ <dig> two tms, 1/ <dig> three tms, while no tm was predicted for pfd1020c. the tm predicted for the majority of rif_as is at the c-terminus, at positions ranging from  <dig> aa to  <dig> aa .

in conclusion, the majority of rif_as  is devoid of a signal peptide, and contains only one tm region, while  <dig> out of  <dig> rif_b rifins  have a signal peptide and two tm regions. these data were confirmed by analysis of rif_as and rif_bs in hb <dig> and dd <dig> clones. more than 60% of rif_as  and 50% of rif_bs  share the secondary structure organisation of rifin found in 3d <dig> 

our results are consistent with available experimental evidence  <cit> . in fact, different sub-cellular localisations in intraerythrocytic stages may be explained by structural differences in rif_as and rif_bs. in particular, it is noticeable that the structural organisation of rif_as resembles that of other antigens like pfemp <dig> and pfemp <dig>  which are exported to the surface of infected erythrocytes, and contain a pexel/vts motif but lack a canonical signal peptide  <cit> .

ab-initio modeling of rif_as
as rifins have no homologies to other eukaryotic proteins, no information about their putative function can be directly inferred from their amino acid sequences. we therefore constructed a 3d-model for rif_a proteins to gain insights into their structural/functional features. rif_a family members were selected for the analysis for their potential involvement in host-parasite interactions. the rationale of the analysis was based on the assumption that all members of the sub-family share a common structure, and took advantage of the large number of rif_a amino acid sequences to obtain and to quantitatively compare several ab-initio 3d structure predictions.

the first step of the procedure was the selection of a non redundant set of sequences, which represented the largest possible range of identity percentages between rif_a members. to this aim, all  <dig> rif_a sequences were first aligned pairwise using the needleman-wunsch algorithm, and only those sequences which shared a percentage of identity lower than 60% were considered. this reduced the dataset to  <dig> proteins. in all cases the protein region subject to the analysis was that from the putative site of pexel cleavage  <cit>  to the c-terminal tm domain.

the ab initio/threading-assembly i-tasser predictor  <cit>  was used to construct 3d-models for the  <dig> selected sequences. the five top models for the every target sequence were considered and thus  <dig> models were used in further analyses. to investigate whether a common fold could be identified among the  <dig> rif_a models, we first carried out a pairwise comparison over the whole set. all models were structurally aligned pairwise using tm-align  <cit>  and a tmscore was used to derive a distance . mds was used to visualise relationships between models on a 2d plane as shown in figure  <dig>  we observed that the majority of structural models  are grouped in a single cluster while other two minor clusters contain the rest of the models . since at least one structure for each of the  <dig> submitted sequences is in the main cluster, we deduced that a common fold has been effectively predicted for members of rif_a sub-family.

in order to select the most representative models, we considered those within a radius of  <dig>  from the centroid of the cluster  <dig>  and then submitted them to the prosa  <cit>  and procheck  <cit>  web servers to assess their quality . the scores and parameters provided by these two methods along with the scores calculated by i-tasser were considered and used to establish the best models for rif_a sub-family. according to this pff0015c_ <dig> and pfl2660w_ <dig> were thus considered as the most representative models for rif_as.

inspection of these two models  revealed that these are alpha-helical structures. the region from the pexel/vts  to the rif_a insert , which is well conserved across the rifin family, is folded into three helices of about  <dig> aa joined by two loops . amino acids in the rif_a insertion which are highly conserved  are shown. we observed that these residues in both models form a loop between two alpha-helices. the sequence from the insert to the tm domain , is highly variable among members of the sub-family , in spite of this we observed that this region is in both models arranged in pairs of almost parallel helices of about 15- <dig> aa joined by short loops. in addition, inspection of other models revealed that this feature is strongly conserved among members of the main cluster .

we submitted the models pff0015c_ <dig> and pfl2660w_ <dig> to the web server profunc  to help identify possible functions of a protein. results obtained by fold matching showed that structures predicted for pff0015c_ <dig> and pfl2660w_ <dig> are folded similarly to two structural domains in pdb database . in figure  <dig> panel b we show the superimposition between rif_a models  and matched structure . these structures are both characterised by an "armadillo-like" fold  <cit>  which comprises two curved layers of alpha helices arranged in a regular right-handed superhelix. these superhelical structures present an extensive solvent-accessible surface that is well suited to binding large substrates such as proteins and nucleic acids.

root mean square deviation  is calculated between the c-alpha atoms of the matched residues in the best 3d superimposition of the query and target structures. the percentage of identity  is the number of identical amino acids in the structural alignment . q-score is the ratio between rmsd and the number of aligned amino acids and is considered as a measure of quality of alignment . z-score provides the statistical significance of a fold match in terms of standard gaussian statistics, the higher z-score; the higher is the significance of the match

discussion
the increasing amount of data from genome-wide experiments  with the parallel development of novel bioinformatics tools led to a remarkable improvement of our knowledge about the biology of malaria parasites. in particular, "in silico" approaches allow the annotation of previously uncharacterised proteins  <cit> , the identification of possible transcription start sites  <cit>  as well as candidates for transcription factor binding sites  <cit> . in addition, efforts have been devoted in structural genomics experiments  with the aim to identify novel targets for drug and/or vaccine development.

in this framework we carried out a "in silico" study on rifins, the most abundant multigene family in p. falciparum genome whose products are potentially involved in host-parasite interactions. in 3d <dig> the family numbers about  <dig> members and it varies in other clones. in fact, the subtelomeric regions where these genes are located are subject to frequent recombination events leading to a high variability between genomes. recently, additional sequencing data have become available for other p. falciparum clones such as hb <dig> and dd <dig> differing in geographical origin and phenotypic characters.

in this work we exploited genome sequence data to carry out a comparative analysis on rifin repertoires between 3d <dig>  hb <dig> and dd <dig>  comparisons were carried out by means of mds on coding as well as upstream and downstream regions. we found that corresponding sequences have a clear cluster structure which is maintained in the three examined clones. furthermore, when we compared the observed occurrences of all  <dig> possible combinations ups-cds-dwn with those expected on the basis of a simple probabilistic model, we found very similar distributions of subsets of such combinations in all the three genomes. in addition, despite the high recombination rate of subtelomeric regions and hence the high expected sequence variability, the majority of genes is conserved between clones  as well as their cluster organisation. our results confirm recent studies by wang et al.  <cit>  which recognised diverse groups of sequences and demonstrated that subsets of genes are highly conserved across genomes. in addition, in the case of upstream and coding sequences we identified several outliers, while none or few were found for downstream sequences. since outliers may be interpreted as novel sequence variants which are generated by genetic drift, their high numbers in 5' upstream and coding sequences, compared to the low number in 3' downstream sequences indicate that the portions of genes diverge differently.

all these data may be interpreted as a consequence of a balance between drift and homogenisation mechanisms acting on these subtelomeric genes. on one hand, this balance guarantees the emergence of novel gene variants, while on the other; it preserves the functionality of the diverse parts of genes  and the overall organisation of the entire repertoire.

in the second part of the work we examined the amino acid sequences of rifins in the 3d <dig> clone. it is already known  <cit>  that rifins can be grouped into two subfamilies: rif_as and rif_bs. the main difference between members is due to an insert sequence of  <dig> aa which is present only in rif_as. in the last few years it has been proposed that despite these differences, rif_as and rif_bs share a similar architectural organisation: a signal peptide at n-terminus; a pexel motif; two transmembrane domains, the second of which is c-terminally located. in this work, we carried out a detailed analysis of all the  <dig> bona fide amino acid sequences of rifins in 3d <dig> and submitted every sequence to signal peptide and transmembrane domain predictors  <cit> . interestingly, while rif_bs structural organisation corresponds to that proposed previously, for the majority of rif_as no signal peptide and only one transmembrane domain at c-terminus were predicted, and hence we proposed different structural architectures for members of the two-sub-families. this is in accordance with petter et al.  <cit>  which demonstrated that rif_as and rif_bs have different sub-cellular localisations. during the intraerythrocytic stages of life cycle of p. falciparum, only rif_as are exported outside the parasite cell, while rif_bs remain confined within the pv. in addition, our results suggest that a canonical signal peptide is necessary to target rifins to the pvm or to other sub-cellular compartments, whereas alternative signals are required for translocation outside the parasite cell as demonstrated at least by the other two antigenic proteins pfemp <dig> and pfemp <dig>  <cit> .

since rif_as are those likely to be involved in host-parasite protein interactions, we constructed a 3d-model for the portion of the protein between the putative pexel cleavage site  <cit>  and the n-terminus of the c-terminal tm. to do this we applied an ab initio procedure starting from the output of the i-tasser algorithm  <cit> . taking advantage from the high number of rifin sequences, we developed a strategy to determine the most reliable 3d-model for rif_as using a subset of  <dig> non-redundant rif_a sequences. five 3d models were constructed by i-tasser for each of the  <dig> sequences. when all  <dig> models were then compared using mds, we observed that they clustered into three groups, the main group of which contains 177/ <dig> predicted structures with at least one structure predicted for each rif_a family member.

in order to establish the most reliable structures for rif_as, we selected  <dig> models within a radius of  <dig>  from the centroid of the main cluster in the mds plane. these structures were submitted to standard methods  for assessing the model quality. the best models pff0015c_ <dig> and pfl2660w_ <dig> were chosen as representatives and then analysed to try to gain insights into rif_as function. we found that both structures strongly resemble the "armadillo-like" fold  <cit> . this fold is characterised by an arrangement of alpha-helices which form a wide cleft with an extensive solvent-accessible surface and is particularly suited to binding large substrates. in fact, this fold has been found in a wide range of proteins involved in very diverse cellular processes in which protein-protein interactions play an essential role. in particular, the structure matched by pff0015c_ <dig> is the tog domain from c. elegans gene zyg <dig> . these domains are found in members of the xmap215/dis <dig> family of microtubule-associated proteins  which are essential for microtubule growth and probably bind tubulin dimers and promote microtubule polymerization  <cit> . the structure matched by pffl2660w_ <dig>  is the n-terminal regulatory domain of diaphanous-related formins  which regulate the nucleation and polymerisation of unbranched actin filaments  <cit> .

to our knowledge these data represent the first attempt to propose a structural model for the rif_a proteins of p. falciparum based on an ab-initio approach implemented on the entire gene family, integrated by an mds-based assessment of the similarities amongst the obtained 3d predictions. importantly, these results predict a protein fold which suggests that rif_as may participate in protein-protein interactions. further work will be needed to establish the cell compartments where this domain is accessible for such interactions, and to identify the host and/or parasite partners involved.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion we found that the overall organisation of rifin repertoires is maintained in three different clones of p. falciparum and that the nucleotide sequences of these genes evolve differently. furthermore, secondary structure predictions on rifin products showed that members of the two sub-families rif_as and rif_bs have different architectures. finally, we proposed a possible role for rif_as on the basis of ab initio 3d models.
