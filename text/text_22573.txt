BACKGROUND
the "amerithrax" anthrax attacks of  <dig> focused attention on the need for rapid and robust diagnostic methods to detect biological threat agents in environmental and clinical samples  <cit> . many laboratory diagnostic platforms  use target-specific antibodies to detect microbial pathogens and toxins. antibody based assays are particularly useful for identifying highly purified biological toxins because such samples contain little if any nucleic acids on which polymerase chain reaction  assays depend  <cit> . simplified antibody-based tests  have been developed for field analysis and are used for a wide range of applications  <cit> . however the standard reagent-grade antibodies used in these tests are heat labile, meaning that they may degrade under harsh conditions, limiting field applications  <cit> . replacing these standard antibodies with a type of immunoreagent that is more stable could greatly simplify the logistical demands of field-deployed biosensors.

a handful of animal species produce antibodies that are functional but are devoid of light chains. these heavy chain only antibodies  can be isolated from members of the camelid family and from sharks  <cit> . the variable regions of hcab  when expressed as recombinant fragments, often called single domain antibodies , exhibit valuable characteristics including small size  and the ability to refold following heating to temperatures which normally causes the irreversible denaturation of conventional antibodies  <cit> . these properties make sdabs attractive candidates for the development of immunodiagnostic tests  <cit> . previously, sdabs able to bind small molecules , or toxins , and viruses  have been isolated  <cit> . of particular relevance, a sdab has recently been developed for the related toxin, toxic-shock syndrome toxin  <dig> , <cit>  and another for the detection of staphylococcus aureus  <cit> .

staphylococcus aureus produces a number of potent enterotoxins, of which staphylococcal enterotoxin b  is the most common cause of food borne poisoning. seb is a single-chain polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids and has a molecular mass of  <dig>  kda  <cit> . in addition to seb's role in food poisoning, the toxin is considered a potential biological threat agent, and is listed as a category b select agent by the centers for disease control. here we describe the isolation and characterization of an anti-seb single domain antibody from an immunized llama, and demonstrate its utility for detecting seb in immunoassays.

RESULTS
evaluation of serum and purified anti-seb igg
our goal was to generate camelid sdabs against seb using a phage display library derived from the white blood cells of a llama serially immunized with seb toxoid and to detail the antigen binding properties of isolated anti-seb sdabs. the llama  was immunized using seb toxoid, and the presence of anti-seb toxin antibodies in the plasma was verified by elisa  prior to library construction. once we confirmed a robust immune response towards seb, we isolated rna from the llama's white blood cells for library construction.

in addition to confirming the presence of anti-seb antibodies in the llama plasma, the immunoglobulin g  was purified and subclasses fractionated into conventional  and heavy-chain only antibody  fractions using protein g and protein a columns. the igg subclasses were evaluated by fast protein liquid chromatography . the igg <dig> was clearly smaller than the igg <dig> as seen by fplc, and composed of only heavy chains as observed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis   confirming the lack of light chains. however, the igg <dig> fraction failed to separate from igg <dig>  thus results using this material are not shown. the lama polyclonal antibody and purified conventional  and heavy chain only  fractions were evaluated along with the isolated sdab to assess their specificity and thermal stability. the llama polyclonal antibody was also paired with the isolated sdab for use in sandwich immunoassays for the detection of seb. these results are discussed below.

isolation of the anti-seb sdab a3
a library was developed from the peripheral blood lymphocytes purified from the immunized llama. this library was estimated to have a size of ~ <dig> by the number of transformants. eleven individual clones were plaque purified and sequenced; all  <dig> were found to be unique and full length.  to isolate a seb specific sdab from the phage display library we conducted  <dig> rounds of panning, followed by monoclonal phage elisa.  following elisa,  <dig> clones were selected and sequenced; all sequenced clones  had identical base pair sequences indicating that by round  <dig> of panning the diversity of binders had been reduced to a single clone. the predicted amino acid sequence, represented by clone a <dig>  is shown in figure 2a. to evaluate its binding characteristics, clone a <dig> was expressed as a soluble protein and purified; its size  was confirmed on a western blot .

specificity of the anti-seb sdab a <dig> and polyclonal llama igg
the initial studies examined the cross-reactivity of a <dig>  as well as both igg <dig> and igg <dig> subclass fractions, to a panel of common threat agent toxins using luminex direct binding assays . we found that a <dig> was specific for seb toxin and did not cross react with other toxin targets including super antigen relatives such as sea and sed. this specificity, which is also observed in conventional monoclonal antibodies, is ideal for developing target-specific reagents for immunodiagnostics or environmental sensing. the llama polyclonal igg <dig> and igg <dig> subclass antibodies purified from the animal demonstrated a much higher titer for seb relative to the other toxins, but at higher igg concentrations they displayed cross reactivity towards sea and sed, demonstrating the rationale for using highly selective monoclonal antibody reagents.

thermal stability of the anti-seb sdab a <dig> and polyclonal llama igg
once the specificity of the sdab a <dig> had been established we evaluated its thermal stability, comparing the selected sdab with anti-seb mab 3b2a, as well as the llama polyclonal igg <dig>  first, an activity assay was utilized, wherein biotinylated aliquots of sdab a <dig>  llama polyclonal igg, rabbit anti-seb  and anti-seb mab 3b2a were evaluated by heating to 85°c for various lengths of time. after cooling, their ability to bind seb coated microspheres was evaluated . within  <dig> minutes of heating conventional llama antibody , as well as ra-seb and mab 3b2a, rapidly lost 80% of their binding activity and after an hour they had lost over 95%. the binding activity of the llama heavy chain antibody subclass igg <dig> initially declined 40% during the first  <dig> minutes of heating but then declined only slowly over the remaining forty five minutes, retaining ~30% of the initial activity. clearly, the sdab a <dig> exhibited the best stability, decreasing slightly  upon initial heating but then residual activity remained fairly constant, dropping again during the last  <dig> minutes to 45% of the initial activity after heating for  <dig> hour.

next, we examined the effect of heating on the secondary structure of the antibodies  by monitoring their cd spectrum during heating. the cd spectrum shows that the sdab a <dig> unfolded upon heating and then refolded when cooled . a <dig> was then subjected to multiple cycles of heating and cooling . by monitoring the ellipticity at  <dig> nm, a <dig> was observed to start losing secondary structure at 80°c, with a melting point at ~85°c. after cooling down, the sdab was found to recover the majority of its secondary structure. the unfolding and refolding transitions occurred rapidly and at nearly the same temperature. clone a <dig> has one of the highest melting points we have observed to date for a sdab  <cit> . to confirm this melting point, this value was also determined using dsc . this method yielded a melting point of 85°c, however under these conditions, high concentration and high maximum temperature, no refolding was observed. to evaluate the melting temperatures of sdabs, including a <dig>  we constructed a normal probability plot . points on this plot will lie along the regression line if the data conforms to a normal distribution. for  <dig> antibodies for which tm has been determined  the data can be seen to fit well to a normal distribution. a <dig>  with a tm above 85°c, can be seen to deviate significantly, implying that this data cannot be explained as an expected variation in a normal distribution.

another interesting finding was that even though the sdab a <dig> maintains its secondary structure until 80°c, its intrinsic fluorescence decreased in a nearly linear relationship with temperature . the decrease in fluorescence intensity can be attributed to the decreasing hydrophobic environment of buried tryptophans as well as to increased vibrational decay due to increased motion. fundamentally, these results indicate that for sdab, fluorescence intensity is a poor metric to monitor protein folding, with the actual cd spectra providing a more precise tm. these results are contrasted by the cd and fluorescence measurements of the llama igg <dig> anti-seb, which lost both secondary structure and fluorescence intensity at comparable rates . more importantly, conventional iggs do not refold properly after heating, permanently losing the bulk of their secondary structure and activity. the thermal resilience shown by the sdab could be extremely useful for detection systems because sdab molecules could be repeatedly used to capture their target simply by serially heating and cooling. such an application would be an important contribution to current bio-detection technologies as it could greatly enhance the ability to field continuous monitoring systems.

affinity of the anti-seb sdab a3
the affinity constants of sdab a <dig> were determined using spr . a <dig> was found to have a very high affinity for seb, table  <dig>  similar results were obtained from both the covalently immobilized a <dig> and the bt-a <dig> bound to a neutravidin coated chip, with both yielding a kd of ~  <dig> to  <dig> pm. when the seb was immobilized, a <dig> bound even more effectively, with a measured kd of ~  <dig> pm, confirming the high affinity interaction that a <dig> has for seb. the mab 3b2a also had a very high affinity for seb. in fact it's off rate was so low we were unable to determine an accurate affinity . these high affinities explain the ability of these immunoreagent to sensitively detect seb as demonstrated below.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the antigen recognition capabilities of the llama derived sdab a <dig> were strong and specific for its target, seb. the a <dig> sdab was also found to be extremely heat resilient and to refold correctly following heat denaturation. these traits make it a valuable contribution to the current biodefense and public health arsenals of threat detection molecules. the availability of high affinity and recyclable recognition elements, such as a <dig>  might also be used to increase the functional range of biosensors in the near future.
