BACKGROUND
almost every aspect of cellular life relies on the dynamic addition and removal of phosphate groups on target proteins. consequently, nearly 5 % of all genes of the model plant arabidopsis thaliana were found to encode for protein kinases and protein phosphatases . a paradigm for the importance of phospho-control is the regulation of the eukaryotic cell cycle. progression through the cell cycle is controlled by heterodimeric enzymes comprised of a kinase subunit, called cyclin-dependent kinase , and a cyclin regulatory subunit  <cit> . substantial work in yeast and animal model systems has shown that high kinase activity levels are in particular required to promote the transition from a gap phase  into s phase where the nuclear dna becomes replicated and from a second gap phase  into m phase  during which the chromosomes are distributed to the newly forming daughter cells. at these two major control points, cdk-cyclin complexes phosphorylate a plethora of target proteins. for instance in budding yeast, more than  <dig> proteins have been found to be substrates of cdc <dig> representing approximately 5 % of its proteome  <cit> . interestingly, some cdk substrates act outside of the core cell cycle connecting cell proliferation with cell differentiation, energy metabolism or other physiological processes such as redox regulation . however, currently very little is known about the molecular basis of the integration of the cell cycle with other cell-physiological processes.

the homolog of the yeast cdc2/cdc <dig> gene is the arabidopsis cdka; <dig>  which is the only arabidopsis cdk that contains the conserved pstaire cyclin-binding motif also found in animal cdk <dig>  cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> proteins. moreover, cdka; <dig> - in contrast to other plant-specific cell-cycle related cdks - can complement the fission yeast cdc <dig> and the budding yeast cdc <dig> mutants . cdka; <dig> expression is linked to proliferation competence and has a key function in controlling s-phase entry next to a role in mitosis hence combining aspects of animal cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> kinases  <cit> . this finding also raises the question to what degree cdka; <dig> and cdk1-type kinases from other organisms operate on homologous substrates in conserved pathways and what plant-specific cdk substrates are.

the detection of potentially plant-specific cdk targets is also key to understand how the cell cycle is integrated into plant development and growth  <cit> , especially in the light of plants being the major source of food and feed for mankind and livestock, respectively and the prospect of plants as alternative resources of energy and raw materials. however, the identification of targets of specific protein kinases is a challenging task due to the high degree of structural and mechanistic conservation of the catalytic cores of all protein kinases and so far only very few substrates for plant cell-cycle kinases have been identified in an unbiased manner, i.e. not by comparison with substrates from other species  <cit> .

one of the most successful procedures to detect kinase targets in yeast and animals has been a chemical genetics approach relying on the observation that a large hydrophobic or polar residue in the atp-binding pocket of the kinase domain can – at least in some cases – be mutated to a smaller amino acid, such as glycine , without largely altering kinase kinetics  <cit>  . the exchange of this ‘gatekeeper’ amino acid increases the size of the atp-binding pocket so that enlarged  atp analogues such as n6-benzyladenosine-5′-o-triphosphate  and n6-adenosine-5′-o-triphosphate  can be used in phospho-transfer reactions. moreover, bulky kinase inhibitors that are derived from 4-amino-1-tert-butyl-3-phenylpyrazolopyrimidine , e.g. 4-amino-1-tert-butyl-3-pyrazolopyrimidine  can be used to specifically inhibit these analog-sensitive kinases  <cit> .fig.  <dig> generation and characterization of an analog-sensitive variant of cdka; <dig>  a sketch of an analog-sensitive kinase variant  that has an enlarged atp-binding pocket in comparison with the wild-type version  through exchanging a ‘gatekeeper’ amino acid , typically a large amino acid, in the wild-type version with a small one such as gly. an analog-sensitive kinase can use regular atp but also bulky derivatives that cannot be used by the wild-type variant as a phosphate donor . b computed 3d structure of the atp binding pocket of cdka; <dig>  in magenta, the space occupied at the bottom of the pocket by the gatekeeper amino acid phenylalanine   <dig> in the wild-type kinase that will be enlarged by the f <dig> to glycine  mutation. c structure of adenosine triphosphate . d structure of the bulky-atp derivate n6-adenosine-5′-o-triphosphate . e in vitro kinase assay with wild-type and the analog-sensitive cdka; <dig>  kinases using cycd3; <dig> as a cyclin partner and histone h <dig> as a generic substrate. first lane from the top, protein blotting reveals equal amounts of cdka; <dig> proteins in the reaction. second lane, kinase assays with -atp as a phosphate donor. forth lane, kinase assays with -n6-phet-atp as a phosphate donor. proteins were subjected to sds-page after the kinase reaction and stained with coomassie brilliant blue r- <dig> demonstrating equal loading of the substrate, lane three and five from the top. abbreviations: p-h <dig> for radio-labeled histone h <dig> resulting from kinase assays with radio-labeled atp, h <dig> for histone h <dig>  f structure of the broad band kinase inhibitor 4-amino-1-tert-butyl-3-phenylpyrazolopyrimidine  on the left and the bulky analogs 4-amino-1-tert-butyl-3-pyrazolopyrimidine  in the middle as well as 4-amino-1-tert-butyl-3-pyrazolopyrimidine  on the right. g in vitro kinase assay with wild-type and the analog-sensitive cdka; <dig>  kinases using cycd3; <dig> as a cyclin partner and histone h <dig> as a generic substrate. inhibition of wild-type  and the analog-sensitive cdka; <dig>  kinases with  <dig>   <dig>  and 10 μm of the pp <dig> derivative 1-nm-pp <dig>  proteins were subjected to sds-page after the kinase reaction with -atp as a phosphate donor and stained with coomassie brilliant blue r- <dig> demonstrating equal loading of the substrate. mock was treated with  <dig>  %  dmso, the solvent of 1-nm-pp <dig>  abbreviations: p-h <dig> for radio-labeled histone h <dig> resulting from kinase assays with radio-labeled atp, h <dig> for histone h <dig>  chemical structures in this figure were drawn with marvinsketch, version  <dig> . <dig> 



the use of analog-sensitive kinases has been pioneered in particular by the laboratory of kevan shokat and such engineered kinases have become a very powerful tool to study many biological problems, for instance in cell-cycle regulation, by either identifying kinase substrates or by modulating their function during the cell cycle . notably, the tunability of analog-sensitive kinases allows the replacement of temperature-sensitive mutants, which have been widely used in the past but often produced many artifacts due to the high  temperature needed for their inactivation, for instance when studying meiosis  <cit> .

analog-sensitive kinases have also been successfully used in plants to study different signaling processes including map-kinases, calcium-dependent protein kinases, and the protein kinase pto that confers resistance of tomato plants  against the bacterium pseudomonas syringae .

here, we adopted this chemical genetics strategy to study the plant cell cycle and generated an analog-sensitive version of cdka; <dig> that largely complemented a cdka; <dig> mutant. application of a pp <dig> analog as a kinase inhibitor was found to specifically reduce the growth of these analog-sensitive cdka; <dig> mutant plants. using then a two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis  approach involving bulky atp derivatives, we performed here a pilot screen and identified a list of putative cdka; <dig> substrates of which five selected substrates were confirmed by kinase assays. these substrates indicate novel routes how growth and cell proliferation could be linked to metabolism and physiology during plant development.

RESULTS
generation of an analog-sensitive variant of cdka;1
arabidopsis cdka; <dig> shares a high degree of sequence similarity with human cdk <dig>  cdk <dig>  and cdk <dig> as well as the yeast cdc <dig> and cdc <dig> kinases . when we modeled cdka; <dig> onto a known crystal structure of human cdk <dig>  all of the important structural elements of cdk <dig> could be matched in cdka; <dig>  e.g. the t-loop  and the p-loop , in accordance with previous reports showing that the molecular mechanistics of cdka; <dig> function are conserved  .

this model indicated that the conserved amino acid phenylalanine   <dig> could function as a gatekeeper residue in restricting the size of the putative atp binding pocket of cdka; <dig>  consistent with a prediction deposited in the kinase sequence database   <cit>  . therefore, we substituted phe <dig> to glycine   with the aim to increase the size of the pocket allowing the use of bulky atp derivatives, such as n6-adenosine-5′-o-triphosphate , in phosphorylation reactions . to evaluate the biochemical activity of the cdka;1f80g protein, we performed in vitro kinase assays with bacterially expressed proteins using a bulky atp, i.e. n6-phet-atp, and histone h <dig> that is typically used as a generic substrate to measure cdk activity  <cit> . although the cdka;1f80g kinase activity was decreased compared to the wild-type kinase, only cdka;1f80g could catalyze the bulky atp demonstrating a high level of specificity that is needed for further substrate identification procedures .table  <dig> structure-based sequence alignment of cdks for the chemical-genetic approach

an enlarged atp-binding pocket usually confers sensitivity towards bulky derivatives of general kinase inhibitors such as pp <dig> . we therefore asked if cdka;1f80g showed analog-sensitivity in vitro against the bulky pp <dig> derivate 1-nm-pp <dig> . treatment of 1-nm-pp <dig> inhibited the kinase activity of cdka;1f80g, but not of the wild-type cdka; <dig>  in a dose-dependent manner .

a major aim of this study was to generate an in vivo tool to identify kinase substrates and modulate kinase activity in the developmental context of a multicellular organism. to test the biological activity of cdka;1f80g, a cdna encoding the mutant version was placed under the control of the endogenous cdka; <dig> promoter that has been previously used in a transgenic approach to express the wild-type cdka; <dig> cdna resulting in a complete rescue of cdka; <dig> null mutant plants  <cit> . since null mutants of cdka; <dig> are sterile and extremely dwarfed  <cit>  , heterozygous cdka; <dig> mutants were transformed with the procdka;1:cdka;1f80g construct. importantly, we obtained wild-type looking plants that were homozygous cdka; <dig> mutant in the progeny of the transformed heterozygous cdka; <dig> mutant plants . these plants were found to contain the procdka;1:cdka;1f80g construct  confirming the biological activity of the cdka;1f80g variant. closer inspection showed that rescue was not 100 % since cdka;1-as plants were slightly smaller than wild-type plants as they grew older . however, cdka;1-as mutant plants grew larger than previously identified weak loss-of-function cdka; <dig> mutants  <cit>  . the cdka;1-as construct did also not confer a dominant negative effect since heterozygous cdka; <dig> mutants containing the construct grew similar to the untransformed plants consistent with the conclusion that cdka;1f80g is functional cdka; <dig> allele, albeit with reduced activity .fig.  <dig> expression of cdka;1-as largely restores the defects of cdka; <dig> mutants. a wild type rosette plants, approximately 1 month after sowing. scale bar: 1 cm. b the cdka; <dig> homozygous mutants are extremely dwarf and can only grow on agar or in liquid media due to the absence of a functional root. ruler scale is at cm. c scanning electron micrograph of a 3 month-old cdka; <dig> homozygous mutant plant seen in b. scale bar: 1 mm. d the expression of the cdka;1-as  mutant largely rescues the development of homozygous cdka; <dig> null mutants that develop a root and can grow on soil. plant shown was planted the same time as the wild-type control in panel a. scale bar: 1 cm. e the expression of cdka;1-as does not confer a gain-of-function effect as seen in plants that contain the as allele in the heterozygous cdka; <dig> mutant background. plant shown was planted the same time as the wild-type control in panel a. scale bar: 1 cm. f heterozygous cdka; <dig> mutants as a control. plant shown was planted the same time as the wild-type control in panel a. scale bar: 1 cm. g p13suc1-associated protein kinase activity purified from wild-type plants , cdka;1-as plants , and heterozygous cdka;1

next, we assessed kinase activity of cdka;1-as by extracting cdk-cyclin complexes from extracts of inflorescences of each genotype with beads coated with p13suc <dig> that is known to bind to arabidopsis cdks including cdka; <dig>  <cit> . consistent with the reduced plant growth of cdka;1-as and reduced kinase activity levels of cdka;1f80g in vitro, we found that p13suc1-associated kinase activity  from these plants was decreased in comparison to that of wild-type plants using bovine histone h <dig> as a generic substrate .

taken together, the f80g gatekeeper mutation of cdka; <dig> diminishes kinase activity in vitro and in vivo. a reduction in kinase activity has been reported for other gatekeeper mutant cdk versions and hence the here-generated version was in the expectation range of an analog-sensitive kinase  <cit> . importantly, the arabidopsis analog-sensitive cdka; <dig> version cdka;1f80g has sufficient activity to support growth and development largely resembling the wildtype, this was not the case with hypomorphic alleles described previously  <cit>  indicating an overall stronger activity in vivo. to our knowledge the here-generated cdka;1-as line is the first analog-sensitive cdk that can be studied in the developmental context of a multicellular organisms and hence represents a novel tool to modulate cdka; <dig> activity and potentially identify novel cdk substrates.

modulating plant growth
as a first test of the usability of the analog-sensitive mutant versions, we aimed to phenocopy the cdka; <dig> null mutant phenotype when applying bulky kinase inhibitors. to this end we used two different inhibitors, 1-na-pp <dig> or 1-nm-pp <dig> , that have been successfully used in yeast and mammalian systems. we started with the application of high concentrations, i.e. 100 μm, to completely abolish cdka; <dig> activity and generate chemically induced loss-of-function mutants  <cit> . although the treatment of arabidopsis seedlings with 100 μm 1-na-pp <dig> was reported previously  <cit> , the application of this compound severely affected the development of wild-type plants under our growth conditions and was therefore not further considered as a chemical cdk inhibitor for cdka;1-as . wild-type plants grown on agar plates containing 100 μm 1-nm-pp <dig> survived although they were slightly reduced in their growth at this high concentration . in contrast, the treatment of cdka;1-as plants with 100 μm 1-nm-pp <dig> severely reduced their growth resembling homozygous cdka; <dig> mutants .fig.  <dig> modulation of plant growth in vivo. a wild-type control plants grown for 2 weeks on ms plates containing the solvent dmso and no bulky kinase inhibitor. scale bar: 4 mm. b wild-type plants grown for 2 weeks on ms plates supplemented with 100 μm 1-na-pp <dig> die. scale bar: 4 mm. c wild-type plants grown for 2 weeks on ms plates supplemented with 100 μm 1-nm-pp <dig> are smaller than wild-type plants grown without the inhibitor but survive. scale bar: 4 mm. d

next, we asked whether plant growth could be modulated by applying a lower concentration of 1-nm-pp <dig>  to assay this, we monitored root growth based on the observation that arabidopsis root growth is in particular sensitive to cdka; <dig> levels  <cit> . the growth of mock-treated wild-type plants was not significantly different from wild-type plants grown on agar plates containing 10 μm 1-nm-pp <dig> . while the roots of mock-treated cdka;1-as plants had approximately 80 % of the length of mock-treated wild-type plants, treatment with 10 μm 1-nm-pp <dig> significantly reduced their size by nearly additional 25 % in contrast to the root growth arrest observed at 100 μm 1-nm-pp <dig> . thus, growth of the cdka;1-as plants generated here can be chemically modulated in vivo setting a base for a detailed analysis and assessment of cell-cycle activity during organ growth and development in the future.

identification of putative cdk substrates by 2d-dige
a second goal of constructing cdka;1-as plants was to identify novel cdka; <dig> substrates since so far only a handful of cdka; <dig> targets are known in plants versus over  <dig> substrates of cdc28/cdk <dig> that have been identified in yeast  <cit> . to this end we followed a strategy based on 2d-dige to identify putative cdk phospho-targets. the basis for this approach is the fact that post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation usually affect the isoelectric point and molecular weight of the proteins, by which their electrophoretic mobility is altered in the gel .fig.  <dig> identification of cdka; <dig> substrates by 2d-dige. a strategy for identifying the kinase substrate by 2d-dige as applied here. for details see descriptions in the text. b in vitro kinase assay using wild-type and the analog-sensitive cdka; <dig>  kinases together with cycd2; <dig> as a cyclin partner using gst-rbr1-his <dig> as a substrate. after the kinase reaction with n6-phet-atp-γ-s as a phospho-donor, proteins were alkylated with pnbm and were subjected to sds-page and transferred to a membrane. thiophosphorylated rbr <dig> was detected with anti-thiophosphate ester antibody  and protein blot with anti-gst antibody  is showing an equal loading of the substrate. mock was treated with 5 % dmso, the solvent of pnbm. abbreviations: pnbm, p-nitrobenzyl mesylate, p-rbr <dig> for thiophosphorylated rbr <dig> resulting from kinase assays with n6-phet-atp-γ-s. c a representative 2d-dige analysis. protein extracts from wild-type seedlings incubated in the presence or absence of n6-phet-atp-γ-s were labeled separately with cy <dig>  and cy <dig> , and proteins were then separated in the same gel in two dimensions and visualized by laser scanning. most of the proteins from each treatment were focused similarly indicating a very low background level using n6-phet-atp-γ-s. d a representative 2d-dige analysis. protein extracts from cdka;1-as inflorescences incubated in the presence or absence of n6-phet-atp-γ-s were labeled separately with cy <dig>  and cy <dig> . proteins were separated and analyzed as in c. e magnified image of c, showing that some spots were focused differently 



first, we asked if cdka;1f80g can catalyze the bulky atp derivative n6-phet-atp-γ-s. the rationale of using a thio-atp variant was to limit the reversal of the kinase reaction since thio-phosphorylated proteins have been shown to be less efficiently dephosphorylated by phosphatases . to detect thio-phosphorylated substrates, we followed a previously presented strategy that is based on the alkylation of thio-phosphorylated serine and threonine  residues creating thereby an epitope for a thiophosphate ester-specific antibody  <cit> . for this experiment, we used the arabidopsis retinoblastoma homolog retinoblastoma related  <dig>  as a native substrate since previous studies have indicated that it is one if not the most important cdka; <dig> substrate in vivo  <cit> . for this purpose, recombinant full-length rbr <dig> protein fused to a dual tag to facilitate purification  was generated in e. coli. the purified recombinant protein was incubated with wild-type cdka; <dig> or cdka;1f80g and n6-phet-atp-γ-s followed by direct alkylation with p-nitrobenzylmesylate . protein blots were performed to detect thiophosphorylated rbr <dig> with the anti-thiophosphate ester antibody, raised against a p-nitrobenzylthiophosphate ester. the signal was detected only in assays with cdka;1f80g , indicating that cdka;1f80g can use n6-phet-atp-γ-s as a thiophosphate donor.

to determine a possible background  label when using n6-phet-atp-γ-s, we incubated extracts from wild-type plants exchanging the buffer to remove the endogenous atp  and in the presence or absence of n6-phet-atp-γ-s and labeled both fractions with cy <dig>  and cy <dig> , respectively. the two extracts were then separated in the same gel using 2d-dige and visualized by laser scanning. this experiment showed that the great majority of proteins was similarly focused indicated by the lack of separation of red and green dots. hence, we concluded that there is only a very low level of unspecific use of n6-phet-atp-γ-s by endogenous arabidopsis kinases paving the road for the use of analog-sensitive kinases to identify substrates .

in the next step, we followed the same experimental procedure using extracts from cdka;1-as mutants . putative substrates can be identified by differentially colored spots and non-overlapping but closely positioned spots on the gel. detection relies on our observation that cdk targets in the protein extracts supplemented with the bulky atp can almost exclusively only be phosphorylated by cdka;1f80g  resulting in an altered electrophoretic mobility. in contrast, proteins that have the same migration behavior in extracts with and without the bulky atp derivative will appear as yellow spots resulting from the overlay of red and green colors .

by peptide-mass fingerprinting, we could then identify a total of  <dig> candidates that showed different migration patterns representing putative cdka; <dig> substrates . these potential substrates mapped into many different developmental and physiological pathways potentially linking cdk activity with many core cellular functions.table  <dig> candidates of cdka; <dig> substrates identified in this study

confirmation by in vitro kinase assays
to test whether the proteins identified by a differential migration pattern in 2d-dige are indeed substrates of cdka; <dig>  we performed in vitro kinase assays. we first generated his:gst-tagged versions of the following six randomly chosen proteins of the list of  <dig> potential substrates and expressed them in e. coli: aldh7b <dig> , fba <dig> , imd <dig> , mmdh <dig> , pfkb-like , and pip  .

the purified proteins were then used in in vitro kinase assays with cdka;1-cycd2; <dig>  a complex that has previously been shown to build a functional dimer   <cit> . out of the six proteins tested, all but fba <dig> were phosphorylated in our in vitro assay . we can currently not exclude that fba <dig> is also a cdk substrate since the cyclin unit is known to play a key role in substrate specificity and we tested here only one out of more than  <dig> theoretically possible cdka;1-cyclin combinations in arabidopsis. moreover, fba <dig> has been shown in other large-scale experiments to be phosphorylated at one short and one long cdk consensus site   <cit> . importantly, the observation that five out of six proteins could be phosphorylated by cdka;1-cycd2; <dig> in vitro provides biochemical evidence that the 2d-dige strategy in combination with analog-sensitive kinase variants allows the identification of cdk substrates.fig.  <dig> in vitro kinase assay against candidate proteins. a histone h <dig> kinase assay. proteins were subjected to sds-page after the kinase reaction with  or without  cdka;1-cycd2; <dig> complexes and stained with coomassie brilliant blue r- <dig> demonstrating equal loading of the substrate. abbreviations: p-histone h <dig> for radio-labeled histone h <dig> resulting from kinase assays with radio-labeled atp. b in vitro kinase assays against candidate proteins. proteins were subjected to sds-page after the kinase reaction with  or without  cdka;1-cycd2; <dig> complexes and stained with coomassie brilliant blue r- <dig>  asterisks in the autoradiograph  show phosphorylated substrates, in the coomassie stain  demonstrate equal loading of the recombinant substrate candidates, respectively. abbreviations: p-cycd2; <dig> for radio-labeled cycd2; <dig> resulting from autophosphorylation by kinase assays with radio-labeled atp



to further characterize the cdka; <dig> phosphorylation sites, we subjected as an example the two here-identified cdka; <dig> substrates imd <dig> and mmdh <dig> to phospho-mass- spectrometry analyses. to this end, sample for both proteins were either treated cdka;1-cycd2; <dig> or not prior to their mass analyses . the phosphopeptide 377-tgdiyspgnk- <dig>  indicating the phosphorylated serine  <dig> matching the cdk consensus sequence) was detected only in the sample of imd <dig> treated with cdka;1-cycd2; <dig> while the non-phosphorylated peptide 377-tgdiyspgnk- <dig> was detected in the both samples of imd <dig> .fig.  <dig> identification of phosphorylation sites of imd <dig> treated with cdka;1-cycd2; <dig> complexes in vitro. a gel image of hisgst-imd <dig> subjected to mass spectrometry analyses. the imd <dig> proteins were treated without  and with  cdka;1-cycd2; <dig>  the proteins were separated by sds-page after the kinase reaction and stained with coomassie brilliant blue. b mass chromatograms  of the selected peptide and mass spectrum  of the peptide. corresponding to , the non-phosphorylated peptide 377-tgdiyspgnk- <dig> was detected in the both samples of imd <dig> treated with  and without  cdka;1-cycd2; <dig> complexes. c mass chromatograms  of the selected peptide and mass spectrum  of the peptide. the phosphopeptide 377-tgdiyspgnk- <dig> was detected only in the sample of imd <dig> treated with cdka;1-cycd2; <dig> , but not in the sample without kinase . s, in the peptide sequence, indicates the phosphorylated serine. d ms/ms spectra of a phosphopeptide pgnk-386) from imd <dig> treated with cdka;1-cycd2; <dig>  the b and y ion series represent fragment ions containing the n- and c-termini of the peptide, respectively. mass chromatogram  is given by plotting the x-axis as the retention time and the y-axis as the ion peak intensity. mass spectrum  is given by plotting the x-axis as the mass-to-charge ratio  and the y-axis as the ion peak intensity

similarly, the phosphorylated peptide 110-kpgmtrddlfninagivk- <dig>  indicating the phosphorylated threonine  <dig> in a non-consensus cdk site) was only found in the sample of mmdh <dig> treated with cdka;1-cycd2; <dig> activity . however, there was no corresponding match to the non-phosphorylated peptide 110-kpgmtrddlfninagivk- <dig> in both samples. we speculated that if the thr in front of the arg in this peptide is phosphorylated, trypsin can hardly cut the peptide after the arg. as an alternative, we henced measured the peptide 116-ddlfninagivk- <dig> in both samples demonstrating the specificity of the phosphorylated peptide in sample treated with cdk activity.

discussion
the identification of kinase substrates remains one of the major challenges for many biological questions. one of the main reasons for our lack of knowledge of substrates is the intrinsically transient nature of the enzyme–substrate interaction, i.e. the “kiss and run” mechanism. another reason is the high degree of structural and mechanistic similarities of protein kinases that all belong into one large superfamily  <cit> . here we have adopted a chemical genetics procedure, which has been very successfully applied in yeast as well as in animals  <cit> , and generated an analog-sensitive variant of the major cell-cycle kinase cdka; <dig> in the flowering plant arabidopsis thaliana. to our knowledge, this is the first example in which an analog sensitive cell-cycle kinase has been generated and studied at an organismic level of a multicellular organism. this version has allowed us to modulate plant growth in vivo and identify novel cdka; <dig> substrates, thus representing a useful tool to analyze plant cell-cycle control.

substrate identification by 2d-dige
several methods have been employed over the last years to reveal kinase substrates. starting from the identification of kinase targets in specialized interaction assay, such a yeast-two-hybrid or bimolecular complementation assays  <cit> . a breakthrough was the development of chemical genetics approaches together with proteome-wide identification of phosphorylated proteins that tremendously promoted our understanding of phosphorylation events  <cit> . these approaches, which have been pioneered in yeast in human cell culture systems, are also now applied in plants allowing eventually a cross-kingdom proteome comparison of phosphorylation levels and states  <cit> .

the chemical genetics approach to identify kinase substrates typically makes use of an antibody to detect thiophosphorylated proteins. in contrast, we have combined a 2d-dige approach with analog-sensitive kinases. while the antibody-based technique is likely more specific, the 2d-dige approach is also more cost-effective. another potential benefit of the 2d-dige method is that, at least in theory, the resolution can be modulated by using different gels . however, we often did not find both distinct green and red but rather only a red or a green spot in our analyses. hence, there is room for improvement of this method. at the same time, the identification of cdk substrates in plants is also still at the beginning and will require much more work and complementary experiments in the future. none-the-less, we could identify by our 2d-dige approach several potential cdk substrates, which we could subsequently confirm by in vitro kinase assays.

cdk substrates within and outside of the cell cycle
cdks are proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinases and their substrates often contain the phosphorylation signature -pro-x-, in which the phosphorylated amino acid  is typically followed by a p and a positively charged amino acid at the position + <dig> and/or + <dig> that interacts with the negatively charged phosphate group in the t-loop of the kinase   <cit> . consistently, the majority of the here-identified cdk targets and substrate candidates contained a consensus site, i.e. three proteins with the long and  <dig> with at least one short consensus site . in addition, cyclins mediate substrate interaction since cdk substrates often contain a short xl  motif that interacts with a small hydrophobic patch on the surface of the cyclin  <cit> . however, several bona fide substrates in yeast have been found to harbor no p motif  <cit> . an example from this study is the putative substrate at5g <dig> that encodes a ribokinase protein  and the mapped phospho-site in the cdka; <dig> substrate mmdh <dig> . thus, the presence or absence of a cdk consensus phosphorylation site is not an unambiguous indication that the respective protein is indeed a cdk substrate making forward experimental assays such as the here-applied strategy necessary.

the best-known cdk substrates are components of the cell-cycle machinery such as the pre-replication complex. in the here-presented pilot study, extracts from inflorescences were used in which proliferating cells represent only a minority of cell types. moreover, even in proliferating cells cell-cycle regulators are typically not highly abundant proteins. thus, it is not surprising that we did not identify cell-cycle regulators as targets. for future approaches, 2d-dige experiments can be performed with selected tissues at specific developmental time points to enrich for specific classes of cdk substrates. in addition, the use of cell cultures that can be chemically synchronized represents a possibility to enrich for cdka; <dig> substrates in different phases of the cell cycle. notably, proteins with a clear function outside of the cell cycle can also be found among the more than  <dig> cdc <dig> substrates in the s. cerevisiae proteome . correspondingly, more than  <dig> genes have been found to be expressed in a cell-cycle phase dependent manner in arabidopsis cell culture also indicating a central function of the cell cycle in orchestrating many cellular functions in plants outside of dna replication and mitosis  <cit> .

interestingly, the activity of the here-identified mmdh <dig> that encodes a mitochrondrial malate dehydrogenase was identified to oscillate in synchronized cultures of euglena  and correlated with cell-cycle activity and the light regime  <cit> . moreover, malate dehydrogenases have been associated with cell-proliferation control since mdh <dig> was found to serve as a transcriptional co-activator of p <dig> in mammals by moving to the nucleus and binding to the promoter of p53-downstream genes. thus, mdh <dig> contributes to the p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest and cell death in response to glucose deprivation  <cit> . however, the possible role of mmdh <dig> phosphorylation in arabidopsis is not clear yet. mmdh <dig> contains two minimal cdk phosphorylation sites of which one  is a predicted phosphorylation site in the phosphat database. however, the here identified non-consensus cdka; <dig> phosphorylation site at thr <dig> has not been deposited in the phosphat database   <cit> .

the nutritional status of a cell, especially regarding carbohydrates, is well-known to be an important regulator of the cell cycle  <cit> . thus, feedback mechanisms from the cell cycle to the metabolic state are likely to have evolved. another potential link between sugar metabolism and the cell cycle is represented from our work by phosphorylation of the ribokinase at2g <dig>  by cdka; <dig> that belongs to the pfkb-like carbokinase family, a large yet poorly characterized group within the ribokinase family  <cit> . furthermore, a second pfkb-like carbokinase family protein  is among the putative but not yet biochemically confirmed substrates. carbohydrate kinase-like proteins have been reported to serve both regulatory as well as direct catalytic functions. members include two arabidopsis adenosine kinases  and reduced adk levels result in growth defects  <cit> , reduced root gravitropism  <cit> , and defects linked to altered cytokinin levels  <cit> .

the here-identified cdka; <dig> target proline iminopeptidase  catalyzes the removal of n-terminal proline residues from peptides  <cit> . the biological role of this activity is not very well understood but may play a role in protein breakdown and recycling of amino acids. phosphat predicts with a moderate confidence level that the pip at2g <dig> is phosphorylated at thr <dig> within a minimal cdk consensus site. similarly, the confirmed substrate imd <dig>  one out of three genes encoding 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenases , is also a predicted phospho-protein with high confidence for the minimal cdk phosphorylation sites and a medium confidence for the long cdk phosphorylation site . isopropylmalate dehydrogenases play a role in the leucine and glucosinolate biosynthesis pathways  <cit> . although glucosinolates are discussed as potential anticancer drugs, a direct link to cell growth and proliferation is not clear yet  <cit> .

the last substrate identified here is aldehyde dehydrogenase , and both minimal cdk consensus sites are predicted in phosphat to be phosphorylated . recent evidence suggests that enhanced activity of specific aldh aldehyde isoforms is a hallmark of cancer stem cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we present here a pilot study that shows that analog-sensitive cdks can be used in vivo to identify kinase substrates in a multicellular organism. this sets the base for future, more detailed and development-specific substrate searches. interestingly, the here-identified substrates hint at many ways of how cell-cycle activity can be connected with other cellular functions. all of these substrates appear to be plant-specific substrates suggesting a largely species- or clade-specific way of integrating the cell cycle with development and physiology.
