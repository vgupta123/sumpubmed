BACKGROUND
maintaining the integrity of dna is dependent on the fidelity of dna replication and is essential for the survival of cells and organisms. dna polymerases are absolutely essential to the eukaryotic replication process  <cit> . dna polymerase delta  plays an important role in genome maintenance through its involvement in replicative dna synthesis and multiple synthetic repair processes  <cit> . dna pol δ has intrinsic 3’ to 5’exonuclease activity, which is fundamental to the function of the enzyme, and the interaction of dna pol δ with proliferating cell nuclear antigen  allows it to replicate dna processively  <cit> .

human dna pol δ is a multi-subunit complex comprised of four subunits: p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig>  <cit> . the p <dig> subunit has been identified as the catalytic subunit and is encoded by the pold <dig> gene in human  <cit> . the polymerase and 3′-5′- exonuclease active sites of pol δ reside in the p <dig> subunit  <cit> . previous studies have shown that reducing the expression of the p <dig> subunit is sufficient to induce genomic instability, as reduced expression of the p <dig> subunit in yeast resulted in errors in dna replication  <cit> . another study linked lower expression of p <dig> subunit to fragile site instability in yeast, presumably by the induction of double-strand breaks at stalled replication forks  <cit> . moreover, the age-related decrease in pold <dig> expression has been shown to be involved in the classical dna repair pathway in vitro  <cit> . furthermore, these was an inverse correlation between pold <dig> expression and age both in vivo and in vitro  <cit> . these data suggest that pold <dig> may be associated with aging. however, how human pold <dig> is involved in senescence-related processes remains unclear.

in the present study, we used hek <dig> cells as the model to investigate the role of human pold <dig> in senescence-related processes, including cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, dna synthesis, and oxidative stress-induced dna damage.

RESULTS
overexpression or downregulation of pold <dig> in hek <dig> cells
first, we introduced pold <dig> expression vector or pold <dig> shrna into hek <dig> cells, using pcdna <dig>  and shcontrol plasmids as negative controls. qrt-pcr analysis demonstrated that pold <dig> mrna level was increased over 4000-fold in hek <dig> cells transfected with pcdna <dig> -pold <dig>  compared to control . conversely, pold <dig> mrna level was decreased by 50 % following transfection with shpold <dig>  compared to control . western blot analysis confirmed that pold <dig> protein level was significantly increased following transfection with pcdna <dig> -pold <dig> , but was significantly downregulated following transfection with shpold <dig> , compared with the respective negative controls . taken together, these data indicate that using plasmids or shrna we constructed, we could effectively overexpress or downregulate pold <dig> in hek <dig> cells.fig.  <dig> modulation of pold <dig> expression in hek <dig> cells. a qrt-pcr analysis of pold <dig> mrna level in hek <dig> cells transfected with pcdna <dig> -pold <dig>  pcdna <dig> , shpold <dig> or shcontrol. b western blot analysis of pold <dig> protein level in hek <dig> cells transfected with pcdna <dig> -pold <dig>  pcdna <dig> , shpold <dig> or shcontrol. untransfected hek <dig> cells were used as a control . n =  <dig>  *p <  <dig>  vs. the negative control

pold <dig> shrna leads to cell cycle arrest in hek <dig> cells
since pold <dig> shrna suppressed the proliferation of hek <dig> cells, we wondered whether these changes are associated with the regulation of cell cycle progression. thus, we analyzed cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry analysis in hek <dig> cells following transient transfection with pcdna <dig> -pold <dig>  pcdna <dig> , shpold <dig>  or shcontrol. we found that the percentages of cells in g <dig> and g2/m phases were increased after transfection with shpold <dig>  compared to the control. although the increases were small, they showed significant differences . however, overexpression of pold <dig> by transfection with pcdna <dig> -pold <dig> did not affect the cell cycle distribution compared to the control . taken together, these results demonstrate that pold <dig> shrna inhibits cell cycle at both g <dig> and g2/m phases in hek <dig> cells.fig.  <dig> effects of altered pold <dig> expression on e cell cycle progression of hek <dig> cells. a representative facs plots showing cell cycle distribution of hek <dig> cells transfected with the indicated vectors. b quantification of the percentage of cells in different phases. n =  <dig>  *p <  <dig>  vs. shcontrol



pold <dig> shrna reduces the rate of dna synthesis in hek <dig> cells
to further investigate the role of pold <dig> in hek <dig> cell proliferation, we performed edu incorporation assay. compared with shcontrol-transfected cells, shpold1-transfected cells exhibited a 30 % reduction in the rate of edu incorporation. consistent with the results of cell cycle analysis, there was no significant difference in dna synthesis following transfection with pcdna <dig> -pold <dig> compared with the control . collectively, these data suggest that pold <dig> downregulation leads to attenuated dna synthesis in hek <dig> cells.fig.  <dig> quantification of dna synthesis rate in hek <dig> cells. a hek <dig> cells were transfected with the indicated vectors, 48 h after transfection edu-positive cells were determined by flow cytometry. b quantification of the percentage of cells positive for edu incorporation assay shown in . n =  <dig>  *p <  <dig>  vs. shcontrol



pold <dig> shrna increases oxidative dna damage in hek <dig> cells
since dna pol δ plays important roles in dna damage repair, we examined whether pold <dig> could protect hek <dig> cells against oxidative dna damage. by comet assay we found that there were no differences in dna damage among hek <dig> cells transfected with pcdna <dig> -pold <dig> or pcdna <dig> , after treatment with 150 μm h2o <dig>  however, pold <dig> shrna led to increased dna damage in hek <dig> cells after treatment with 150 μm h2o <dig>  compared to control shrna transfected cells . these data suggest that pold <dig> shrna impairs dna damage repair in hek <dig> cells.fig.  <dig> effects of altered pold <dig> expression on dna damage in hek <dig> cells. a hek <dig> cells were transfected with the indicated vectors and treated with 150 μm h2o <dig> for 5 min in the dark. comet assay was then performed, and images were acquired using a fluorescence microscope to show dna fragment migration patterns. b quantification of the tail moments from the comet assay shown in . *p <  <dig> , vs. the negative control 



discussion
cell proliferation plays an essential role in senescence  <cit> . in the present study, we found that the downregulation of pold <dig> gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of dna pol δ, markedly inhibited cell proliferation. further analysis showed that the inhibition of cell proliferation following pold <dig> downregulation was related to the inhibition of cell cycle progression and dna synthesis. interestingly, we found that pold <dig> overexpression had no significant effects on cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and dna synthesis. we think that endogenous pold <dig> may be enough to regulate these processes and exogenous overexpression of pold <dig> could not achieve additional effects. collectively, our data suggest that pold <dig> promotes cell proliferation by regulating cell cycle and dna synthesis.

in mammals, cell proliferation and cell cycle progression are tightly regulated processes, and loss of expression of specific genes encoding proteins essential for dna synthesis may lead to mitotic dysregulation in senescent cells  <cit> . pold <dig> is a key component of dna pol δ catalytic subunit and plays an important role in cell growth and differentiation  <cit> . previous studies have indicated that replicatively senescent cell populations arrest in both g1and g <dig> stages  <cit> . in our study, we found that pold <dig> shrna blocked cell cycle at g <dig> and g2/m phases and resulted in reduced dna synthesis. these results provide new evidence for the potential role of pold <dig> in the regulation of cell cycle progression. studies have shown that the pold <dig> promoter has consensus sequences at the sp <dig> and e2f binding sites  <cit> . e2f is thought to be crucial for the g1/s transition and dna replication. therefore, e2f may regulate pold <dig> expression during cell cycle progression. moreover, p <dig> represses sp1-stimulated pold <dig> promoter activity  <cit> , and p <dig> blocks e2f <dig> release by binding to the pold <dig> promoter at the e2f <dig> binding site, thereby inhibiting pold <dig> activity  <cit> . these findings may explain the mechanisms by which pold <dig> is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation.

during aging, free radicals and reactive oxygen species  accumulate in cells and tissues. ros generate a variety of dna lesions, including oxidized dna bases, abasic sites, single-strand breaks , and double-strand breaks   <cit> . previous data indicate that oxidative stress appears to play an essential role in the process of premature aging  <cit> . therefore, efficient dna repair in is very important to prevent cell aging. the predominant repair pathways in mammalian cells are base excision repair , nucleotide excision repair, dsb repair and mismatch repair  <cit> . ber is a major mechanism involved in the protection of cells from mutagenic base damage spontaneously generated through normal cellular metabolism or dna damage caused by exogenous agents, such as oxidative stress, hydrolysis, and environmental factors. in addition to its crucial role in dna replication, dna pol δ plays an essential role in dna repair and is generally regarded as the primary enzyme involved in resynthesis  in various dna repair processes  <cit> . dna pol δ plays an important role by modulating the rate of single-nucleotide ber and long patch ber during the repair process  <cit> . therefore, we hypothesized that pold <dig> could affect oxidative dna damage in hek <dig> cells. our results showed that pold <dig> shrna markedly resulted in increased dna damage induced by h2o <dig>  potentially through inhibiting dna replication  and dna synthesis associated with dna repair. our data suggest that pold <dig> may provide protection against oxidative dna damage through various dna repair systems.

however, secondary roles of pold <dig> in other pathways should be considered. it is possible that some unidentified factors are activated following pold <dig> downregulation and contribute to the inhibition of cell proliferation and increased dna damage. further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which pold <dig> regulates cell cycle and dna damage response.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we demonstrated that pold <dig> downregulation markedly inhibited cell proliferation by regulating cell cycle and dna synthesis. pold <dig> downregulation also resulted in increased dna damage induced by h2o <dig>  therefore, pold <dig> plays an important biological role in cell cycle regulation and dna damage repair.
