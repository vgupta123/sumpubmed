BACKGROUND
spermatogenesis is a productive self-renewing system of adult stem cells that continuously generates spermatozoa through life. at the foundation of this system is the spermatogonial stem cells   <cit> . in mouse testis, isolated a  spermatogonia  are believed to be the most primitive cells and contain the stem cells. in normal situations, while half of as cells divide and give rise to apr  spermatogonia that are interconnected by cytoplasmic bridges due to incomplete cytokinesis, the remaining half of as cells undergo self-renewal divisions. the apr spermatogonia further divide to become chains of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> aal  spermatogonia. the as, apr, and aal spermatogonia can only be identified by their topographical configurations on the basement membrane of the seminiferous tubules and are collectively referred to as "undifferentiated" spermatogonia, although this nomenclature causes confusion because this population contain both progenitor cells that undergo differentiation and stem cells that are truly undifferentiated  <cit> . the aal spermatogonia differentiate into a <dig> spermatogonia, which undergo six cell divisions before entering meiosis via a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  intermediate, and b spermatogonia. the transition from aal  to a <dig>  is a sensitive step during spermatogonial development, as it can be disrupted by several conditions such as cryptorchidism and vitamin a deficiency  <cit> . spermatogonial transplantation along with other studies have demonstrated that sscs are a subpopulation of undifferentiated spermatogonia, most likely as cells, but not differentiating spermatogonia   <cit> . subdivision of the undifferentiated spermatogonia using cytological markers would greatly facilitate characterization of this unique cell population, but so far has not been achieved.

we previously identified lin <dig>  as a gene differentially expressed in mouse spermatogonia by a cdna subtraction screen  <cit> . lin <dig> is predominantly expressed in primitive type a spermatogonia  <cit> . lin <dig>  encoding an evolutionarily conserved small rna-binding protein, was first identified as a key regulator of developmental timing in c. elegans  <cit> . in c. elegans, lin <dig> is expressed in early larval stage but is rapidly suppressed during embryogenesis and in adult animals by the lin- <dig> microrna and the lin- <dig> protein  <cit> . recently, lin <dig> was used together with oct <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog to reprogram human somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells  <cit> . in mice, lin <dig> is expressed in diverse embryonic tissues, embryonic stem cells, and embryonic carcinoma cells, but not in most adult tissues  <cit> . collectively, these studies have demonstrated that the expression of lin <dig> is associated with pluripotency.

in this report, we find that lin <dig> is specifically expressed in the undifferentiated spermatogonia  of adult mouse testis. our analysis of lin <dig> and ngn <dig> suggests that lin28-expressing undifferentiated spermatogonia can be cytologically divided into two subpopulations: ngn3-gfp-negative spermatogonia that contain high stem cell activity/potential and ngn3-gfp-positive cells that are more committed to differentiation.

RESULTS
lin <dig> is specifically expressed in germ cells in the testis
we cloned lin <dig>  from mouse spermatogonia in a cdna subtraction screen  <cit> . semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis using enriched germ cell populations showed that the expression of lin <dig> in testis is restricted to spermatogonia  <cit> . western blot analysis of a panel of adult mouse tissues revealed that the lin <dig> protein is abundantly expressed in testis but not in other tissues examined . the testis of xxy* male mice completely lack germ cells but contain somatic cells such as sertoli and leydig cells  <cit> . the absence of lin <dig> in xxy* testes demonstrated that lin <dig> was germ cell-specific , in agreement with previous studies  <cit> . as controls, lin <dig> protein was abundant in mouse embryonic stem cells but absent in fibroblast feeder cells . we examined the relative protein level of lin <dig> in juvenile testes. lin <dig> was detectable in testes right after birth, increased its abundance with age, and was most abundant around puberty  .

lin <dig> marks undifferentiated spermatogonia
we next examined the expression of lin <dig> by immunostaining of juvenile testis sections . lin <dig> was expressed in gonocytes from postnatal day 1-old mice and in spermatogonia from day 6- and day 14-old mice. lin <dig> was predominantly cytoplasmic with punctate nuclear staining. immunostaining analysis of adult testis sections revealed that lin28-expressing cells were sparsely located at the periphery of seminiferous tubules , suggesting that lin <dig> is expressed in a subset of spermatogonia but not in meiotic and post-meiotic germ cells . we also found that the number of lin28-positive spermatogonia per tubule varied among the stages of seminiferous tubules . the seminiferous epithelium of mice is divided into twelve stages, each of which is defined by a unique association of differentiating germ cells  <cit> . for example, undifferentiated aal spermatogonia become differentiating a <dig> spermatogonia during stages vii-viii  <cit> . our results showed that the number of lin28-positive spermatogonia peaked at stage viii but decreased sharply at stage ix, indicating that lin <dig> might be expressed in undifferentiated spermatogonia .

to address whether lin28-expressing cells are indeed undifferentiated spermatogonia, we performed whole-mount immunofluorescent studies on dissected seminiferous tubules from adult testes. in these studies, undifferentiated spermatogonia can be definitively identified as as, apr, or aal. the apr and aal spermatogonia are connected by intercellular cytoplasmic bridges as a chain of 2n cells. we found that the expression of lin <dig> was restricted to as and the chained 2n cells  . a chain of 32-interconnected cells was very rare . chains with a non-2n number of lin28-positive cells were also observed at a low frequency . gfra <dig>  is a marker of undifferentiated spermatogonia  <cit> . as expected, lin <dig> was expressed in gfra1-positive spermatogonia . these whole-mount analyses demonstrated that lin <dig> marks the undifferentiated spermatogonia.

expression of lin <dig> in cultured spermatogonial stem cells 
spermatogonial stem cells  are believed to be a subset of as cells  <cit> . currently, there are no cytological markers that could distinguish sscs from "non-stem" as cells. to examine whether lin <dig> is expressed in sscs, we performed double immunostaining of cultured spermatogonia highly enriched for sscs with anti-lin <dig> and anti-plzf or anti-gfra <dig> antibodies. plzf is required for maintenance of sscs  <cit> . we found that lin <dig> was expressed in cultured sscs, but the abundance of lin <dig> in sscs was not uniform, suggesting the heterogeneity of in vitro cultured sscs .

in an attempt to determine the role of lin <dig> in the maintenance of sscs, we treated sscs with lin <dig> sirnas. the sirna knockdown decreased the level of lin <dig> mrna by 60% and consequently reduced the abundance of lin <dig> protein by nearly 60% . however, sirna treatment did not causes a change in the total number of cultured cells , suggesting that the remaining lin <dig> protein might be sufficient for maintaining ssc or that lin <dig> is dispensable for the survival of sscs.

several recent studies have demonstrated that lin <dig> is a negative regulator of let- <dig> microrna biogenesis in embryonic stem cells and other stem cells  <cit> . specifically, lin <dig> prevents dicer from processing let- <dig> micrornas by mediating the terminal uridylation of let- <dig> microrna precursors  <cit> . in agreement with these studies, sirna knockdown of lin <dig> in cultured sscs led to an increased level of mature let-7g mirna .

ngn3-gfp labels a more committed subpopulation of lin28-positive spermatogonia
ngn <dig> is specifically expressed in undifferentiated spermatogonia   <cit> . to determine if ngn <dig> and lin <dig> mark the same population of undifferentiated spermatogonia, we made use of ngn3-gfp mice, in which gfp was inserted into the ngn <dig> locus by gene replacement  <cit> . we performed whole-mount immunostaining of ngn3-gfp seminiferous tubules with anti-lin <dig> and anti-gfp antibodies. this analysis revealed that only a subpopulation of lin28-positive spermatogonia was gfp-positive . overall, ~40% of lin28-positive as spermatogonia were gfp-positive, supporting that the population of as cells were not homogeneous. the apr and aal spermatogonia were either all gfp-positive or all gfp-negative  except a few as described later . interestingly, the percentage of ngn3-gfp-positive spermatogonia increased dramatically as spermatogonia develop from as to aal  . while ~40% of as cells were gfp-positive, nearly all aal  spermatogonia were gfp-positive. as the number of chained cells increases, spermatogonia become more and more committed to differentiation. taken together, our data suggested that ngn <dig> delineates a more committed subpopulation of undifferentiated spermatogonia, in contrast, the lin28-positive but ngn3-gfp-negative spermatogonia are more primitive.

we observed heterogeneity of ngn3-gfp expression among apr and aal spermatogonia . in apr spermatogonia, one cell was gfp-positive and the other was gfp-negative . in an 8-cell chain of aal spermatogonia, seven cells were gfp-positive but one was gfp-negative . in a 16-cell chain of aal spermatogonia, two cells in the middle of the chain were gfp-negative . twelve out of  <dig> clusters examined  were found to contain both gfp-positive and gfp-negative cells in the same chain . the presence of ngn3-gfp-negative cells in a chain of gfp-positive spermatogonia suggested that the gfp-negative cells might have de-differentiated and thus reverted to a more primitive  fate.

discussion
the transition from undifferentiated aal to differentiating a <dig> spermatogonia is a critical point during spermatogonial development and is tightly regulated  <cit> . this transition is specifically perturbed by several conditions, including cryptorchidism, vitamin a deficiency, and steel and c-kit mutations  <cit> . in this study, we found that lin <dig>  a pluripotency factor, is specifically expressed in the undifferentiated  spermatogonia, suggesting that it might play a role in maintaining the undifferentiated state in spermatogonia. lin <dig> is expressed in mouse and human embryonic stem cells, embryonic carcinoma cells, neural stem cells, and diverse embryonic tissues  <cit> . recently, lin <dig>  together with oct <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog, was used to reprogram human fibroblasts to pluripotent stem cells  <cit> . in mammalian cultured cells, the expression of lin <dig> appears to be associated with "stemness"  <cit> . very recent studies have discovered a feedback loop, in which lin <dig> blocks the maturation of the let- <dig> micrornas and lin <dig> is downregulated by let- <dig>  <cit> . specifically, lin <dig> prevents the processing of let- <dig> precursor micrornas by dicer through mediating the terminal uridylation of let- <dig> precursors  <cit> . notably, lin <dig> is not essential for reprogramming human fibroblasts into pluripotent stem cells but does increase the reprogramming efficiency  <cit> . the sirna knockdown experiments suggested that lin <dig> might not be essential for self-renewal of human es cells  <cit> . we tested the role of lin <dig> in the maintenance of sscs by sirna knockdown. the sirna treatment did not cause a change in the total number of cells in culture, suggesting that lin <dig> might be dispensable for maintenance of ssc or that the remaining lin <dig> protein after knockdown might be sufficient for its full function. however, consistent with the known function of lin <dig> in blockade of let- <dig> mirna processing  <cit> , we found that sirna knockdown of lin <dig> in cultured sscs caused an increased level of mature let-7g mirna. in a recent study of five genes  involved in the ssc self renewal, sirna treatment caused a decrease in the number of ssc stem cells as determined by transplantation without changing the total number of cells in culture  <cit> . therefore, the possible involvement of lin <dig> in ssc self-renewal remains to be determined by sirna treatment followed by transplantation in future studies.

ngn <dig> is also specifically expressed in undifferentiated spermatogonia in mouse  <cit> . pulse-chase labeling studies using ngn3/cre™ cag-cat-z transgenic  mice identified two compartments of spermatogonial stem cells: the actual stem cells and the potential stem cells  <cit> . in a normal situation, the actual stem cells undergo self-renewal and give rise to transit cells that further divide to become terminally differentiated cells. the transit cells, immediate progeny of actual stem cells, are potential stem cells, in a sense that they can function as stem cells in the case of loss of actual stem cells or when transplanted  <cit> . nakagawa et al showed that ngn3-cre-mediated pulse-labeled spermatogonia contributed to only  <dig> % of actual stem cells and to  <dig> % of potential stem cells. however, it is difficult to image that such low percentages of contribution to stem cells might be entirely due to the low efficiency of ngn3/cre-mediated recombination as previously discussed  <cit> .

we have demonstrated that the population of undifferentiated spermatogonia is cytologically divided into two subpopulations: ngn3-gfp-negative and ngn3-gfp-positive. as cells, the most primitive type of undifferentiated spermatogonia, are heterogeneous. more than 40% of lin28-positive as spermatogonia are ngn3-gfp-negative. the percentage of ngn3-gfp-positive clusters increases progressively with the chain length of interconnected undifferentiated spermatogonia , suggesting that ngn3-gfp-expressing spermatogonia are more committed to differentiation , while ngn3-gfp-negative ones are more primitive . we hypothesize that the low contribution of ngn3-cre-mediated pulse-labeled cells to stem cells found in the previous study  <cit>  is more likely attributed to the previously unknown population of ngn3-negative undifferentiated spermatogonia. therefore, our current studies together with the pulse-chase labeling experiments done by nakagawa et al  <cit>  show that the ngn3-positive cells contain few  actual stem cells and some potential stem cells . by inference, these studies suggest that the ngn3-negative undifferentiated spermatogonia might contain >99% of the actual stem cells and nearly 90% of potential stem cells.

according to the as model, as  spermatogonia and a few apr  can act as stem cells  <cit> . in this model, the as spermatogonium divides either to produce two new stem cells if separate or to become apr if two daughter cells remain connected by an intercellular bridge. however, it remains unknown whether apr and aal spermatogonia in mouse could potentially act as stem cells. in drosophila testis and ovary, transit-amplifying germ cells can dedifferentiate and revert into functional stem cells  <cit> . recently, c-kit-positive  spermatogonia were shown to be able to revert to functional stem cells when transplanted into testis  <cit> . studies of cdh1-expressing spermatogonia showed heterogeneous expression of c-kit and tacstd <dig> among undifferentiated spermatogonia, lending support for de-differentiation in mouse  <cit> . in the current study of mouse testis, we have observed that, in the same chain of aal spermatogonia, one or two cells are ngn3-gfp-negative, while the remaining cells are ngn3-gfp-positive, suggesting that ngn3-gfp-negative cells in the aal spermatogonia might have reverted to a more primitive state.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have shown that lin <dig>  a pluripotency factor, is specifically expressed in undifferentiated spermatogonia in mice, suggesting that it might play a role in maintenance of the undifferentiated state of this primitive germ cell population. we have also found that the undifferentiated spermatogonia exist as two subpopulations: ngn3-gfp-negative  and ngn3-gfp-positive . in addition, our study provides cytological evidence supporting dedifferentiation of spermatogonia in mice.
