BACKGROUND
next generation sequencing  technologies have transformed infectious disease molecular epidemiology, generating unprecedented amounts of high quality genomic data for a range of downstream applications. the rapidly declining cost, low error rate, and high throughput of existing second-generation platforms enables generation of whole-genome sequences  for inventory of standing pathogen genomic variation across space and time and development of powerful single nucleotide polymorphism  markers . high density, genome-wide snps are critical for fine-resolution studies of pathogen transmission chains, population structure, phylogeography, phylogenomics, and for a range of genome-wide association studies .

however, the power of ngs has not yet been fully harnessed for vector-borne and zoonotic disease  systems, the majority of globally emerging infectious diseases  <cit> . although ngs sequencing has provided valuable insight into the genomic diversity of easily culturable vbz parasites such as plasmodium spp. and trypanosoma spp., large-scale genomic studies of field-collected pathogens has been stymied by the difficulty of obtaining high-quality wgs data for pathogens more difficult to culture. this is due to the high ratio of host  to pathogen dna present in mixed dna samples  <cit> . the overwhelming presence of this exogenous dna  renders shotgun sequencing inefficient and cost-prohibitive. the development and availability of an efficient, and cost-effective method to retrieve wgs directly from field-collected vbz samples will  enable study of pathogen demographic and evolutionary history, providing critical information to predict pathogen spread or monitor the success for epidemiological interventions, and  provide a wealth of genomic resources for association studies  <cit> .

the agent of the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the us, the lyme disease bacterium, borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, exemplifies this common hurdle to genomic study for many vbz systems. b. burgdorferi’s small genome , is overwhelmed by the genome size of its black-legged tick vector, ixodes scapularis   and, in average field collected nymphal ticks, b. burgdorferi represents < <dig>  % of the total dna template. pure b. burgdorferi cultures would be the ideal template for generation of genomic dna libraries, enabling maximally efficient deep sequencing. however, culturing b. burgdorferi directly from its tick vector is labor intensive and culture success is strain-dependent, introducing significant bias  <cit> . shotgun approaches for wgs of pathogens directly from field samples are inefficient due to the excess of contaminating host dna present in the samples, which result in very low sequence coverage of the low copy number bacterial genomes present  <cit> . recently, the use of selective whole genome amplification to amplify dna from the target bacteria from mixed dna samples has been proposed  <cit> . while this method enables enrichment of b. burgdorferi dna from artificial mixtures of bacterial dna, it was not validated for b. burgdorferi genome sequencing directly from field-collected ticks with spirochete burdens expected in natural infections. furthermore, this method includes a pcr-based whole genome amplification step prior to sequencing, introducing several potential biases .

despite the well documented increase in incidence of human lyme disease over the last forty years  <cit> , b. burgdorferi molecular epidemiology and population genetic studies have relied on analyses of single genes or multi-locus sequence typing based on eight housekeeping genes  . use of these coarse markers precludes fine-scale study of b. burgdorferi variation in the field and highlights the need for a population genomics approach for study of the epidemiology and biology of this important human pathogen.

the advent of hybrid capture  in synergy with ngs has overcome limitations related to low input and mixed dna samples  <cit> . using custom oligonucleotide arrays, hybrid capture harnesses the differential power of dna hybridization to extract a genome of interest from a mixed template. this method was originally developed for human genome-wide association studies  <cit> , where it was used to selectively re-sequence the human exome  <cit> . hybrid capture does not require amplification prior to sequencing, thus circumventing the biases known to be introduced by whole genome amplification and similar methods  <cit> . moreover, hybrid capture can enrich for divergent sequences, even when oligonucleotide arrays used to capture the targeted genome are derived from a single reference genome  <cit> . although this method has been successfully applied in a variety of systems  from ancient human dna  <cit>  to modern human clinical samples of plasmodium falciparum  <cit> , it has not yet been exploited for assessing pathogen genomic diversity directly from mixed dna template specimens derived from arthropod vectors and/or animal reservoir hosts.

in this study, we demonstrate the efficiency of combining hybrid capture techniques and ngs to enrich for b. burgdorferi genomic dna directly from field collected vector samples. using this combined approach we i) evaluate the capture efficiency for b. burgdorferi genomes in different multiplexed capture strategies, ii) generate  <dig> b. burgdorferi wgs at high coverage, and iii) identify high quality genome-wide snps. this new efficient and cost-effective method can be readily applied to a variety of vbz disease systems and enables us to take advantage of field collections for population genomic studies of emerging pathogens.

RESULTS
whole genome capture efficiency
shotgun sequencing
using one hiseq <dig> lane, we directly sequenced two whole tick dna extracts  with a b. burgdorferi load, measured by qpcr, within the expected range of field-collected nymphs   <cit> . this generated ~ <dig> million reads  with a mean capture efficiency  of < <dig>  % . the majority of remaining sequence reads  mapped to the tick vector i. scapularis draft assembly. this represents an underestimate of tick-derived reads, as the ~66 % of the i. scapularis draft assembly consists of highly repetitive regions affecting the overall mapping efficiency .table  <dig> mapping statistics. for each sample the first four columns list the sample names followed by the capture reaction , the total number of sequenced bases  prior to filtering, and the percentage pcr duplicates. the final five columns report the capture efficiency , the percentage of sequence covered by at least one generated sequence read and the fold coverage  of filtered data for the linear chromosome  and the longest linear plasmid, lp <dig> , respectively

target capture and sequencing
we performed whole genome capture using custom b. burgdorferi probes of  <dig> unique field-collected infected tick samples. these samples were previously genotyped and include  <dig> mlst sequence types and  <dig> igs types . the spirochete load for all the analyzed samples, measured by qpcr, fell within the expected range of field-collected nymphs   <cit>  . sample dna content was a conservative estimate of the range of dna yield within field-collected nymphal ticks extracted through standard procedures  .

the hybridization capture approach effectively enriched for b. burgdorferi in all examined genomic samples. the thirty-five enriched samples  were pooled and sequenced on one illumina hiseq  <dig> lane, generating  <dig>  gigabases  of sequence data. after pcr and optical duplicates were removed, we obtained an average of  <dig>  megabases  of read data/sample , of which a mean of  <dig>  mb  mapped to the b. burgdorferi b <dig> reference genome. mean capture efficiency across samples was  <dig>  %  . on average,  <dig>  mb/sample  mapped to the i. scapularis draft assembly . whole genome capture efficiency of b. burgdorferi was significantly correlated with proportion of tick-derived reads captured   and with the b. burgdorferi input sample load   in univariate models.

whole genome coverage
coverage statistics were calculated for the entire b. burgdorferi b <dig> reference genome , including the linear chromosome  and  <dig> plasmids .

shotgun sequencing
across the two samples,  <dig>  % of the b. burgdorferi chromosome was covered at an average coverage of  <dig> x. similarly low coverage was obtained for the longest plasmid lp <dig> , with 23 % of the sequence covered at  <dig> x .

target capture and sequencing
across the  <dig> unique samples and the five replicates,  <dig>  %  of the chromosome was covered at an average coverage of 132x  . two short chromosomal regions between 435– <dig> kb and 438– <dig> kb exhibited low coverage across all samples . these regions contain the 23s rrna duplicated genes  <cit> . for the longest plasmid, lp <dig>  the average portion covered was  <dig>  %  at 133x  . a lower coverage was observed across the other  <dig> circular plasmids and the  <dig> linear plasmids, with 62 % of the plasmid sequences covered at an average of 63-fold coverage, and with 75 % of the plasmid sequences at an average of 80-fold coverage, respectively . among the circular plasmids, cp32- <dig> and cp32- <dig> showed the lowest percentage bases covered  , and among the linear plasmids, lp <dig> was the only linear sequence showing less than 50 % of covered bases, at an average of 45-fold coverage .fig.  <dig> comparison of the mean coverage for b. burgdorferi genomes across capture reactions. a the linear chromosome  and b the linear plasmid, lp <dig> . the y-axis indicates the coverage depth averaged over all samples in each capture reaction, defined as the total number of sequenced bases which map to each nucleotide in the reference b <dig> genome calculated on a window size of 1000 bp after removal of potential pcr duplicates and reads with mapping quality ≤ <dig>  the x-axis indicates the reference position relative to the samples; the light blue region indicates the area within one standard deviation of the mean coverage of samples captured in the capture reaction. gc content  for the chromosome and the linear plasmid calculated on a 1000 bp window size are shown below the coverage plots



comparison of multiplexing schemes
we assessed the efficiency of capturing b. burgdorferi when multiplexing different numbers of samples for hybrid capture reaction. the multiplexing strategy is schematically depicted in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  additional file 1: figure s <dig> shows the results of the hybrid capture by multiplexing  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> indexed tick genomic dna libraries in a single pool. table  <dig> summarizes b. burgdorferi capture efficiency for each sample by capture reaction. high average capture efficiency for the 4-plex, 10-plex, and 20-plex captures was consistently achieved , whereas the 1-plex capture sample efficiency was low . the logistic regression models applied to correlate capture efficiency with the proportion of tick-derived reads and b. burgdorferi input sample load, identified the sample captured in 1-plex as a significant outlier . we speculate that the 1-plex sample presented low efficiency due to the possible saturation of capture probes by non-specific dna template molecules. however, we do not have replicates of the 1-plex capture and the low efficiency may reflect the stochasticity of capture.

five tick samples were captured in duplicate, allowing for direct comparisons of capture efficiency for the same starting genomic library and pathogen load. table  <dig> compares capture efficiency among sample replicates. although the total number of reads generated per sample was inversely correlated with the number of samples pooled, no significant changes in efficiency between captures was observed, except for the 1-plex capture, a clear outlier with significantly lower efficiency than the other captures table  <dig> pairwise comparison of multiplex captures. comparison of b. burgdorferi capture efficiency from tick genomic libraries that were captured twice in different reaction capture using different multiplexing scheme

genome-wide snps and snp effect analysis
we detected  <dig>  nucleotide polymorphic sites for the entire data set, with a range of 437– <dig> /genome. an average of  <dig> snps  were randomly distributed across the b. burgdorferi b <dig> chromosome  . the program snpeff v <dig> b was used to predict the effect of the identified snps on b. burgdorferi coding sequence. for this analysis, we focused on the chromosome as plasmids contain large stretches of dna rearrangements, non-homologous recombinations, and inverted repeats. on average  <dig> snps were found in coding sequences , of which  <dig> were classified as non-synonymous mutations . the average ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous  mutations was  <dig>  . pairwise comparison of identified snps and number of snps within cds between replicate samples showed consistency in snp detection and location of snps across capture pools .

discussion
our results demonstrate the feasibility of combining hybrid capture techniques with ngs to successfully enrich for a target pathogen, b. burgdorferi, directly from field-collected vector samples. using this approach, we generated high quality genomic resources and a repository of genetic variants for  <dig> unique b. burgdorferi field strains for a variety of downstream applications. we obtained high capture efficiency  and nearly complete coverage of the b. burgdorferi genome  at 132-fold coverage across all the  <dig> analyzed samples. by contrast, shotgun sequencing with no pre-enrichment step was significantly less efficient, resulting in only  <dig>  % of b. burgdorferi-derived sequences . the low efficiency of the shotgun approach is consistent with previous findings using the same approach directly on infected ticks, where on average only 1/ <dig> of b. burgdorferi genome/sample was recovered  <cit> .

obtaining high-quality reads with even coverage of the reference can be difficult for templates with biased nucleotide composition  <cit> . however, we achieved consistently uniform coverage along the majority of the b. burgdorferi chromosome , although its nucleotide composition is at-rich , suggesting that even low gc content microbial genomes can be efficiently sequenced with this method. the incomplete coverage of some plasmids  is expected as previous studies have found dna rearrangements and inverted repeats are common across b. burgdorferi plasmids  <cit> , rendering mapping difficult with short-read data alone.

hybrid capture avoids both bacterial culture and whole genome amplification, currently standard methods used to enrich pathogens prior genome sequencing and known to be biased in strain representation and propagation of sequencing errors, respectively . further, our study validates this approach for field-collected samples representative of the b. burgdorferi copy number and total arthropod dna content found in natural vector populations.

in the  <dig> wgs, we identified high levels of genetic polymorphisms at the chromosomal level . this is a significant improvement from the coarse resolution provided by the highly-conserved mlst markers  <cit> , previously considered the gold-standard for b. burgdorferi molecular typing, and other common markers such as igs and ospc  <cit> .

comparison of different multiplexed capture pools demonstrates high capture efficiency and genome coverage of b. burgdorferi even when multiplexing up to  <dig> genomic libraries in a single capture reaction , with equivalent sensitivity in snp detection observed in the pairwise comparison of the replicates in the 10-plex or 20-plex reaction . thus, this multiplexed capture method is highly scalable, substantially lowering the capture reaction cost per sample.

many other vbz pathogens currently share the same research bottleneck: the difficulty in obtaining a sufficient number of pathogen genomes from suboptimal field samples for population genomic study. hybrid capture is generalizable and can be used to study both vbz and other pathogens avoiding the difficulties, biases, and costs inherent to pathogen culture or whole genome amplification. multiple infections involving multiple parasite species within a single vector specimen as well as mixed infections involving genetically distinct clones of the same parasite species within a single vector are frequent  <cit> . in the first instance, hybrid capture methods may be applied for population genomic study of several bacterial, protozoan, or viral pathogens co-vectored by the same blacklegged tick vector such as anaplasma phagocytophilum, babesia microti, and powassan virus  using a multiple-pathogen capture array. in the second case, hybrid capture can enrich for the entire population of a single pathogen infecting a single vector or host. if multiple haplotypes are present within the enriched sample, computational and statistical methods can be used to detect and resolve the composition of mixed infections, a level of pathogen diversity often ignored when using pathogen cultures or multi-locus genotyping with sanger sequencing  <cit> .

this methodology can also be applied across diverse vbz systems such as study of african trypanosomes directly from collections of the tsetse fly  or american trypanosomes directly from the triatomine vector  <cit> . finally, we note that the development of a single set of capture probes for a pathogen of interest will enable generation of pathogen wgs directly from vector and host samples , enabling study of host specificity and potential transmission bottlenecks.

additionally, hybrid capture has a variety of other potential applications in public health and molecular ecology for studies in which the target dna represents 1 % or less of a mixed dna sample. for example, hybrid capture could be adopted as a non-invasive method for whole genome sequencing of target pathogens directly from fecal samples from human and wildlife species , archived human and animal samples that have been fixed or frozen, or from environmental samples  <cit> , enabling early identification of known zoonotic pathogen outbreaks and their potential origins.

hybrid capture methods will allow for highly efficient and massively parallel re-sequencing of genomes of interest for non-model organisms, while minimizing cost and effort of sequencing host dna. given the high capture efficiency observed in this study, the average throughput of a hiseq  <dig> lane passing quality control , and length of our target genome , we determine that sequencing of up to  <dig> whole b. burgdorferi genomes to an optimal coverage of 30x can be conservatively conducted on a single illumina hiseq <dig> lane  and costing approximately $ <dig> . the cost of hybrid capture and sequencing for a single pathogen with similar genome size to our study organism, for an equivalent coverage, is approximately $227/per sample when multiplexing at least  <dig> samples per hybridization capture. this cost estimate includes the costs for the library creation, the synthesis of capture array and the illumina sequencing . thus, the efficiency and scalability of the proposed method renders population genomic study of b. burgdorferi economically feasible. by contrast, shotgun sequencing of b. burgdorferi directly from its vector is highly inefficient, as we obtained only  <dig>  % of the pathogen genome at low coverage. to obtain a comparable genome coverage necessary for population genomic study   <cit> , shotgun sequencing of a single b. burgdorferi-infected tick sample would require  <dig> hiseq <dig> lanes . the equivalent sequencing coverage for a single hybrid capture sample would require a fraction of the shotgun sequencing effort .

we propose that multiplexed hybrid capture can be widely applied to sequence other bacterial, protozoan, and viral genomes that exist in low titers in a variety of mixed dna samples and will enable fine-resolution population genomic study. yet, several possible limitations need to be considered. first, a preexisting reference genome for the target pathogen or a closely related species is required for capture array design. however, because probe oligonucleotides can hybridize dna sequences with up to 78 % nucleotide divergence, probes designed using genomes from closely related species can still efficiently enrich for the target pathogen  <cit> . conversely, host reference genomes are not necessary for capture array design. in our study, we took advantage of the available draft genome of the i. scapularis tick species to test the efficiency of capture. second, repetitive elements and recombination events within the target genome may be difficult to resolve. however, our results show that we captured nearly the complete b. burgdorferi genome, on average  <dig>  % of the chromosome and  <dig>  % of the longest plasmid, lp <dig>  even after excluding repetitive elements that could not be resolved by read mapping alone . given the nature of the genomic data retrieved, it is impossible to identify recombination events. exclusion of repetitive elements and detailed mapping of recombination events will not preclude evolutionary studies which focus on the large amount of variation present across the rest of the pathogen genome. finally, captured variation is limited by the set of probes included in the capture array and the sequence divergence allowed , such that novel gene sequences within the target genome may not be captured. however, previous studies have shown that the rate of gene acquisition in b. burgdorferi is higher between than within species, and that this rate is among the lowest in bacterial pathogens  <cit> . this suggests high genome stability and few lineage-specific genes in b. burgdorferi, which reduces the impact of this possible bias in this study system.

CONCLUSIONS
genomic studies of vector-borne and zoonotic pathogens, such as b. burgdorferi, have been hindered by the high ratio of host-to-pathogen dna in arthropod vectors. we adapted target enrichment methods for study of the tick-borne spirochete b. burgdorferi directly from field-derived tick samples. sequence data enable powerful reconstruction of pathogen transmission chains, phylogenies, and gwas for cultivable pathogenic microbes. the proposed multiplexed hybrid capture and sequencing method enabled the generation of nearly complete genomes of b. burgdorferi and the identification of high density, genome-wide snps directly from vector samples. we showed that this methodology is highly scalable and cost-effective and can be applied to a variety of vbz systems as well as broader applications in molecular ecology.
