BACKGROUND
acute myeloid leukemia  is characterized by clonal expansion of immature myeloblasts in the bone marrow and eventually leukemization  <cit> . the only curative treatment is intensive chemotherapy that can be combined with stem cell transplantation especially in younger patients below 60- <dig> years of age  <cit> . this treatment is followed by a period of severe bone marrow failure with severe pancytopenia, including lymphopenia. rapid lymphoid reconstitution after therapy is associated with increased aml-free survival, an observation strongly suggesting that immunological events early after chemotherapy are clinically important  <cit> . this association between reconstitution and survival has been observed after conventional intensive chemotherapy  <cit> , autotransplantation  <cit>  and allotransplantation  <cit> . the mechanisms behind these associations are not known but may involve  treatment-induced immunogenic cell death with translocation of endo-calreticulin to the cell surface and induction of antileukemic t cell reactivity  <cit> ,  increased efficiency of antileukemic immune reactivity during this period of low leukemia cell burden, or  treatment-induced alterations of immunoregulatory networks. the remaining lymphocytes during chemotherapy-induced cytopenia may thus be important for this antileukemic effect.

previous studies have described increased levels of circulating immunosuppressive cd4+ cd25high treg cells for patients with untreated aml  <cit>  and these increased levels persist after chemotherapy when complete hematological remission is achieved  <cit> . the pretreatment treg levels even seem to predict the response to the chemotherapy  <cit> . the peripheral blood levels of proinflammatory th <dig> cells and il <dig> plasma levels are also suggested increased in untreated aml, but in contrast to treg cells these levels normalize when complete remission is achieved  <cit> . however, the levels of various t cell subsets during the early period of chemotherapy-induced cytopenia have not been investigated previously, and in the present study we therefore compared the t cell subset distribution for aml patients  before treatment,  during the period of severe chemotherapy-induced cytopenia, and  during hematopoietic reconstitution after treatment. the t cell subsets investigated were ifnγ secreting cd8+ cytotoxic t  and cd4+ helper t  cells, il17-a secreting cd4+ helper  cells and cd4+ cd25+ foxp3+ regulatory t  cells.

methods
patients
the studies were approved by the local ethics committee . all blood samples were collected after informed consent. aml was diagnosed according to the who criteria  <cit> .

patients with newly diagnosed aml
in our studies of primary human aml cells we included unselected patients with high peripheral blood blast counts; enriched leukemic cell populations could then be prepeared by density gradient separation alone .

aml patients receiving intensive chemotherapy
samples for analysis of t cell subsets were obtained from  <dig> patients receiving intensive cytarabine-based therapy . all patients were sampled between  <dig> and  <dig> a.m., and the analysis of samples or preparation of cultures started within  <dig> hours after sampling. these patients represent a consecutive group admitted to our hospital for either induction or consolidation therapy. for all patients receiving induction chemotherapy  examination of bone marrow samples drawn during cytopenia  <dig> days after start of therapy verified that leukemic cells could no longer be detected; these patients were only included after the bone marrow control. the other patients were tested following consolidation therapy, i.e. they had achieved disease control and were in complete hematological remission before treatment. thus, none of the patients had detectable disease when tested during cytopenia. most of our patients  were investigated during the period of severe chemotherapy-induced cytopenia with peripheral blood neutrophils <  <dig>  × 109/l and dependency on regular platelet transfusion to maintain blood platelets > 10- <dig> × 109/l. the last four patients were only investigated during the regeneration after cytopenia. the patients tested during pancytopenia were also lymphopenic with total lymphocyte counts in peripheral blood <  <dig>  × 109/l.

six patients in this first group  were examined during hematopoietic reconstitution, i.e. within  <dig> days after stable peripheral blood neutrophils >  <dig>  × 109/l. four of these patients had reached hematological remission prior to sampling ; the last two patients reached complete remission within one week after sampling .

we also analyzed the peripheral blood levels of various t cell subsets in a second group of  <dig> patients that represent a consecutive group investigated during a one month period . this group is referred to as the second cohort. the absolute as well as the relative levels of various t cell subsets were investigated before , during and following chemotherapy-induced cytopenia for the patients; paired statistical analyses were thereby possible.

two additional groups with cytopenic patients were also examined. firstly, we used a whole blood assay to investigate the polyclonal t cell release of il17-a after activation with anti-cd <dig> + anti-cd <dig> + eventually il <dig>  in this assay cell separation procedures are avoided by diluting heparinized blood with culture medium, and t cells are activated by specific anti-cd3/anticd <dig> antibodies during culture in this plasma/medium mixture as described below . the in vitro assay and the patient characteristics have been described in detail in a previous publication  <cit> . secondly, we investigated the il17-a release by a panel of t cell clones derived from patients with therapy-induced cytopenia; these patients and the preparation and characterization of the clones have also been described previously  <cit> .

healthy controls
the controls  did not differ significantly with regard to age and sex from the patients tested for t cell subset distribution during chemotherapy-induced cytopenia. however, the controls were younger than the patients with untreated disease. before statistical comparisons we therefore investigated whether there was any age-dependent difference among the controls, and if this was detected we compared untreated patients with those controls being above  <dig> years of age .

preparation of enriched aml cells
leukemic peripheral blood mononuclear cells  were isolated by density gradient separation  from the peripheral blood of patients with a high percentage of aml blasts among blood leukocytes . cells were cryopreserved in 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum  plus 10% dimethylsulphoxide  and stored in liquid nitrogen. the studies of t cell subsets included  <dig> unselected patients . these cells are also referred to as primary human aml cells . leukemic pbmc were also used for analysis of t cell responsiveness after stimulation with anti-cd <dig> + anti-cd <dig> as described below for the whole blood assay.

flow cytometry
intracellular il17-a, ifnγ and foxp <dig> in t cells
sodium heparin blood samples were obtained and erythrocytes lysed by bd pharm lyse solution . cryopreserved leukemic pbmc were also analyzed. pre-warmed x-vivo 10® culture medium  was added and the cell concentration adjusted to  <dig> cells/ml before incubation for  <dig> hours with or without  <dig> μl/ml of leukocytes activation cocktail with bd golgiplug  at 37°c in a humidified atmosphere of 5% co <dig>  the cells were thereafter washed in ice-cold 1% bsa/pbs followed by staining with percp-conjugated mouse anti-human cd <dig> , fitc-conjugated anti-cd <dig> , fitc-conjugated anti-cd <dig>  and/or pe-conjugated anti-cd <dig>  on ice for  <dig> minutes. samples were washed once in pbs before fixation and permeabilization using ebioscience fixation/permeabilization concentrate , fixation/permeabilization diluent  and permeabilization buffer   as recommended by the manufacturer. intracellular staining was performed at room temperature for  <dig> minutes with the mouse monoclonal alexa fluor 647-conjugated anti-human il17-a , alexa fluor 647-conjugated anti-foxp <dig> , pe-conjugated anti-il17-a  or pe-conjugated anti-ifnγ . four-color flow cytometry was performed by a facs calibur system. for each sample at least  <dig>  <dig> lymphocytes were counted. results were analyzed by flowjo software .

estimation of absolute lymphocyte counts
absolute count determination was done according to the manufacturer's specifications. briefly, samples were incubated with anti-human cd3-percp  for  <dig> minutes before addition of flow-count fluorospheres , followed by immediate analysis by a facs calibur system. for each sample  <dig> beads were counted. results were analyzed by flowjo software .

analysis of il <dig> receptor  expression by primary human aml cells
cells were stained with unconjugated mouse anti-human il17-r  using qifikit  in combination with anti-cd <dig> conjugated with apc . the analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. gates for viable leukemia cells were based on forward and side scatter and  <dig>  <dig> events were collected.

analysis of stat, p <dig>  creb, erk1/ <dig> and akt phosphorylation in primary aml cells
as described previously  <cit> , aml cells were incubated for  <dig> minutes with or without il17-a, gm-csf or ifn-γ before stat, p <dig>  creb, erk1/ <dig> and akt phosphorylation were analyzed by using alexa647-conjugated anti-phospho-stat <dig> , anti-phospho-erk1/ <dig>  and anti-phospho-akt ; and alexa488-conjugated anti-phospho-stat <dig> , anti-phospho-p <dig>  and anti-phospho-creb  monoclonal antibodies .

cell culture
whole blood assay for analysis of il17-a release
the standardization of this in vitro assay has been described in detail in a previous methodological publication  <cit> , and its use for analysis of t cell cytokine responses in patients with chemotherapy-induced cytopenia has also been described previously  <cit> . briefly, heparinized blood samples were diluted with growth medium; cells were thereafter incubated in this plasma/medium mixture and t cells activated with anti-cd <dig> and anti-cd <dig> . the t cell concentration in the cultures was <  <dig> × 104/ml. cultures were incubated for  <dig> days at 37°c in a humidified atmosphere of 5% co <dig> before supernatants were harvested and il17-a levels determined . even though several leukocyte subsets are present in these cultures, it should be emphasized that in our experiments we compared differences in cytokine levels for cultures with and without t cell activation signals , and the most likely explanation for increased cytokine levels after t cell directed signaling is increased release by activated t cells.

proliferation studies of primary human aml cells
this in vitro assay has been described previously  <cit> . briefly,  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/well were incubated in flat-bottomed microtiter plates  in  <dig> μl stem span sfem™ medium  supplemented with  <dig> μg/ml of gentamicin and eventually  <dig> ng/ml of il <dig>  il1ra, il1β, il <dig>  flt3l, scf, gm-csf or g-csf . proliferation was assayed as 3h-thymidine incorporation after  <dig> days.

statistical analysis
the spss software was used to perform wilcoxon's test for paired samples, mann-whitney test for unpaired samples, spearman's rho for correlation or linear bivariate regression analysis.

RESULTS
relative levels of cd3+ t cells are increased in aml patients with therapy-induced cytopenia
we investigated the levels of circulating cd3+ t cells for patients with untreated aml  and leukemia patients with severe chemotherapy-induced cytopenia  and during reconstitution after chemotherapy . patients were compared with healthy controls  and the overall results are presented in figure 1a. as expected the percentage of cd3+ t cells among total leukocytes was decreased and depended on the degree of leukemization for patients with untreated disease. during chemotherapy-induced cytopenia significantly increased levels of circulating cd3+ t cells were observed , and very few normal  and leukemic myeloid cells remained. during hematopoietic reconstitution  the percentage of cd3+ t cells showed an expected normalization although a wide variation was observed among the patients.

we then compared the relative cd3+ t cell levels among total lymphocytes in the patient groups . for some untreated patients the lymphocytes and aml cells had overlapping side and forward scatter , and these patients  had to be excluded from this analysis. patients with chemotherapy-induced cytopenia showed significantly increased percentages of cd3+ cells among total lymphocytes compared to healthy controls and patients with untreated disease. the cd3+ percentage thereafter normalized during hematopoietic reconstitution, although the variation range was wider than for the controls.

the relative levels of cd8+ and cd4+ t cells are normal following intensive chemotherapy
the levels of circulating cd8+ cytotoxic  and cd8-  helper  t cells among total cd3+ t cells were determined in all three patient groups . the tc and th levels showed only minor variations in the aml patients and did not differ significantly from the healthy controls. however, both for tc and th cells the variation ranges were generally wider for patients with untreated disease and severe chemotherapy-induced cytopenia than for the patients in the reconstitution phase and for healthy controls.

circulating tc <dig> and th <dig> cells are decreased during severe chemotherapy-induced cytopenia
patients were investigated for relative levels of circulating tc <dig> and th <dig> cells among cd3+ t cells by intracellular ifnγ staining. gating strategies are shown in figure 2a  and the overall results for patients and healthy controls are presented in figure  <dig>  relative levels of tc <dig> cells, defined by the expression of cd3+ cd8+ and ifnγ+, were normal in untreated aml. however, the levels were decreased during chemotherapy-induced cytopenia  compared to the controls  before normalization during reconstitution . relative levels of th <dig> cells, defined by the phenotype cd3+ cd8- ifnγ+, were also significantly decreased during therapy-induced cytopenia  compared to the controls  before normalization occurred during reconstitution . finally, the absolute levels of tc <dig> and th <dig> cells were also decreased and significantly correlated when investigated in the second cohort of patients .

relative levels of circulating th <dig> cells are maintained in aml patients with chemotherapy-induced cytopenia
the patients were examined for relative levels of circulating th <dig> cells by intracellular staining against il17-a followed by flow cytometric analysis. gating strategies are shown in figure 2a  and the overall results for patients and healthy controls are presented in figure  <dig>  the relative levels of circulating th <dig> cells, defined by the phenotype cd3+ cd8- il17-a+, did not differ between healthy controls and aml patients with untreated disease, treatment-induced cytopenia and regeneration after chemotherapy. however, patients with untreated disease and chemotherapy-induced cytopenia showed wider variation ranges than the other groups.

we examined levels of il17-a in culture supernatants when t cells among leukemic pbmc  were activated with anti-cd <dig> plus anti-cd <dig> as described for the whole blood assay. detectable il17-a levels up to  <dig> pg/ml were observed after t cell activation; this is similar to normal pbmc  that also showed detectable release up to  <dig> pg/ml . thus, because this il17-a release occurred in response to t cell specific stimulation  the most likely explanation for the increased levels is that the ability of circulating t cells to release il17-a is maintained in the presence of primary aml cells even though these cells show constitutive release of several immunoregulatory cytokines  <cit> . il <dig> levels are actually higher for untreated patients than for the controls when considering the different t cell concentrations in the cultures.

we investigated the polyclonal t cell release of il17-a for another group of aml patients with chemotherapy-induced cytopenia  <cit> ; peripheral blood leukocytes were then cultured in a whole blood assay and il17-a levels determined in the culture supernatants . samples cultured in medium alone or with isotypic control antibodies usually showed undetectable  or low il17-a levels . detectable levels were present only for a minority of samples  after stimulation with anti-cd <dig> + anti-cd <dig> and anti-cd <dig> + anti-cd <dig> + il <dig>  but these levels were significantly higher than for the corresponding unstimulated control cultures . an unselected subset of  <dig> consecutive samples was in addition cultured with the antileukemic drug pep <dig>  <cit>  in combination with anti-cd <dig> + anti-cd <dig> + il <dig>  pep <dig> significantly increased the il17-a levels compared with the corresponding drug-free controls, and detectable levels were then observed for  <dig> of the  <dig> samples . finally we compared il17-a levels with the levels of ifnγ, gm-csf, il <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig> and tnfα after t cell activation with anti-cd <dig> + anti-cd <dig> and anti-cd <dig> + anti-cd <dig> + il <dig>  gm-csf was the only cytokine that showed statistically significant correlations with il17-a both after stimulation with anti-cd <dig> + anti-cd <dig>  and anti-cd <dig> + anti-cd <dig> + il <dig> . thus, the remaining th <dig> cells in cytopenic patients are functional and because these increased levels occurred after t cell-specific stimulation with anti-cd <dig> + anti-cd <dig> the most likely explanation is that the remaining t cells are able to release detectable il17-a in response to adequate stimulation as a part of a broad cytokine response.

we compared phytohemagglutinin and anti-cd <dig> stimulated il17-a release by a panel of t cell clones derived from another group of cytopenic patients  <cit> . detectable il <dig> release was observed for  <dig> out of  <dig> cd4+ cd8- t cell clones and  <dig> out of  <dig> cd4- cd8+ clones. these results further confirmed that il17-a-releasing t cells  remain in the circulation during severe chemotherapy-induced cytopenia. however, the il17-a levels were relatively low  for those clones with detectable release. all the il17-a releasing t cell clones were cd2+ cd3+ cd19- tcrαβ+ tcrγδ- cd57- and additionally released ifnγ and gm-csf .

thus, only a minority of remaining clonogenic t cells is able to release detectable il17-a and the frequencies are comparable to those detected by the flow cytometry assay.

relative levels of circulating cd4+ cd25+ foxp3+ t cell are increased in aml patients before and following intensive chemotherapy
the relative levels of circulating treg cells were determined for all the patients by intracellular staining against foxp <dig> and analysis by flow cytometry. gating strategies are shown in figure 2b and the overall results are presented in figure  <dig>  increased levels of natural treg cells, defined by the phenotype cd3+ cd4+ cd25+ foxp3+, were detected for aml patients with untreated disease, chemotherapy-induced cytopenia and regeneration after treatment when compared with healthy controls. the treg levels were highest for patients with untreated disease and chemotherapy-induced cytopenia; thereafter the levels decreased significantly but were still higher than for the controls. as an alternative strategy for analysis of treg cells we determined the percentage of cd3+cd4+cd25high cells in all the samples . the analysis confirmed that the highest levels of treg cells were detected in patients with untreated leukemia and during chemotherapy-induced cytopenia . the foxp3+ and cd25high treg levels were significantly correlated both in patients with untreated leukemia and during chemotherapy-induced cytopenia .

relative levels of circulating th <dig> and th <dig> cells show significant correlations in aml patients with untreated disease and treatment-induced cytopenia
we compared the levels of circulating tc <dig>  th <dig>  th <dig> and treg cells for patients and healthy controls . significant correlations between the levels of circulating th <dig> and th <dig> cells were detected for aml patients with untreated disease and during chemotherapy-induced cytopenia; this correlation was stronger for untreated  than for cytopenic patients  and no correlation was found during reconstitution and for in healthy controls. even though we also found significant correlations between th <dig> and tc <dig> levels for all groups except patients in reconstitution , the th <dig> and tc <dig> levels showed no correlation . finally, treg cells showed no significant correlations with any other t cell subset . these observations were also confirmed when investigating absolute t cell counts in the second cohort of patients; th <dig> and th <dig> levels then showed a highly significant correlation , whereas treg cells showed no significant correlations with any other t cell subset.

th <dig> and th <dig> levels are significantly higher in healthy males than females but this gender-dependent difference is not detected after intensive aml chemotherapy
significantly higher levels of circulating th <dig> cells were observed for healthy males  compared with females . this difference was detected both for younger and elderly controls. a similar difference was also observed when comparing male  and female  patients with untreated aml, although it reached only borderline significance . in contrast, th <dig> levels differed between males and females when comparing the elderly controls above  <dig> years of age but not when comparing the whole control group; a similar difference of borderline significance  was observed only for patients with untreated disease. no gender differences in th <dig> and th <dig> levels were seen for aml patients during cytopenia or reconstitution . finally, the levels of circulating t cell subsets showed no significant correlations with cytogenetics, induction or consolidation chemotherapy or serum level of c reactive protein at the time of sampling.

acute leukemia patients with severe chemotherapy-induced pancytopenia: studies of absolute levels of various t cell subsets in a second cohort of patients
we investigated relative and absolute t cell levels in a second cohort of  <dig> consecutive aml patients receiving intensive chemotherapy. for all patients the relative treg levels were increased during cytopenia  compared with pretherapy levels  and the levels detected during early reconstitution . the absolute treg cell counts showed a wide variation between the patients during cytopenia , and this wide variation persisted during the early hematopoietic reconstitution with increasing neutrophil counts . for two of these patients the absolute treg counts increased markedly during cytopenia compared with the pretherapy and early regeneration levels; levels up to  <dig>  cells/μl were then observed and this increase was not accompanied with an increase of total cd4+ t cells. in contrast to treg levels, the absolute th <dig> cell counts showed only minor variations in individual patients during cytopenia; the counts were within the range of 3- <dig>  cells/μl, and for  <dig> of the  <dig> patients stable counts below  <dig> cells/μl were detected. pretherapy levels were generally within the same range , whereas the absolute th <dig> levels showed a wider variation during early reconstitution . thus, these results support the data from the first patient cohort: absolute and relative levels of circulating treg cells are increased during cytopenia whereas the th <dig> levels only shows minor variations after chemotherapy.

we also compared the tc1:treg, th1:treg and th17:treg ratios for patients tested before, during and following severe chemotherapy-induced cytopenia . all ratios decreased during cytopenia, i.e. the levels of the three other subsets decreased compared with the treg levels. finally, when comparing the overall results treg and th <dig> absolute cell counts showed no statistically significant correlation; this is similar to the observations in the first cohort.

il17-a has only minor effects on the functional characteristics of primary human aml cells
th <dig> cells and il <dig> have important immunoregulatory functions but also an additional regulatory role in normal hematopoiesis  <cit> . furthermore, previous studies have also demonstrated that il17-rb can be expressed by t-positive aml cells  <cit> . for these reasons we investigated whether il <dig> had a direct role in regulation of leukemic hematopoiesis; this has been described for several other t cell derived cytokines  <cit> . first we investigated il17-r expression by primary aml cells derived from  <dig> consecutive patients. for  <dig> of these patients we detected a small il17-r+ cd34- leukemic subpopulation ; and none of these patients expressed the genetic t abnormality. furthermore, when comparing the overall results for the  <dig> patients we did not observe any significant alteration in the phosphorylation status of intracellular stat <dig>  stat <dig>  p <dig>  erk1/ <dig>  creb and akt after il17-r ligation, although responses were observed for some individual patients . an expected intracellular phosphoresponse was observed after exposure to gm-csf and ifnγ .

we also investigated whether il17-a had any effects on aml cell proliferation. the overall results are shown in additional file 3: table s <dig>  leukemic cells derived from  <dig> consecutive patients were cultured in vitro with and without il17-a  <dig> ng/ml. detectable spontaneous proliferation corresponding to at least  <dig> counts per minute  was observed only for 13/ <dig> patients, and il17-a caused a significant enhancement of the in vitro proliferation . the leukemic cells were also cultured with and without il17-a in the presence of  <dig> ng/ml of il1ra, il1β, il <dig>  flt3l, scf, g-csf or gm-csf. il17-a caused a minor, though statistically significant, increase of cytokine-dependent proliferation in the presence of il1β, il <dig>  scf, g-csf and gm-csf. however, the increase exceeded  <dig> cpm and corresponded to > 20% of the il17-a-free control only for a small minority of patients. il17-a had no significant effect on clonogenic aml cell proliferation and did not affect the constitutive aml cell release of il1β, il <dig> and tnfα . to summarize, il17a-r is expressed only by a minority of primary aml cells, receptor ligation usually does not induce detectable intracellular phosphoresponses and exogenous il17-a has only minor effects on functional aml cell characteristics.

discussion
previous studies of treg cells in human aml have included patients with untreated disease and patients in complete hematological remission. aml patients with chemotherapy-induced cytopenia have not been examined, even though clinical studies suggest that immunological events early after chemotherapy are important for the antileukemic effect of chemotherapy. in the present study we therefore compared t cell subset distribution in aml patients with severe chemotherapy-induced cytopenia with  untreated patients or patients during regeneration after intensive chemotherapy; and  healthy controls. the cytopenic patients had increased relative levels of circulating treg cells, whereas levels of tc <dig> and th <dig> cells were decreased while th <dig> cells were not altered.

early lymphoid reconstitution after chemotherapy is associated with decreased risk of leukemia relapse  <cit> , and these observations suggest that immunological events early after chemotherapy are clinically important. the immunological status during treatment-induced cytopenia are determined by pre-existing disease-induced abnormalities and chemotherapy-induced defects  <cit> . previous studies have demonstrated that even patients with severe therapy-induced lymphopenia have an operative t cell system  <cit> , and in this context we investigated the balance between various proinflammatory and suppressive t cell subsets in aml patients.

as expected the relative levels of cd3+ t lymphocytes to total leukocytes were dependent on the degree of leukemization in patients with untreated aml. more important, the frequencies of circulating cd3+ t cells among total lymphocytes were decreased in patients with untreated disease compared with healthy controls, these levels were increased during chemotherapy-induced pancytopenia before normalization during reconstitution. even though our cytopenic patients had lymphopenia, our results suggest that cd3+ t cells are less sensitive to intensive chemotherapy than myeloid cells and other lymphocyte subsets .

we did not find any significant differences in relative cd8+ and cd4+ t cell levels between healthy controls and patients examined before or following intensive chemotherapy. in contrast, the relative levels of circulating ifnγ secreting cd4+  and cd8+  t cells were decreased in cytopenic patients before normalization during reconstitution . this decrease is also reflected in the decreased tc1:treg and th1:treg ratios during cytopenia . taken together these observations strongly suggest that treatment-induced lymphopenia is not a random process and the susceptibility to intensive chemotherapy differ between t cell subsets.

th <dig> cells constitute a separate proinflammatory t helper  cell subset  <cit> . studies in animals as well as humans suggest that th <dig> cells are important for anticancer immune reactivity  <cit> . a previous study described increased frequencies of circulating th <dig> cells in patients with untreated aml and with a normalization when patients achieved complete remission after chemotherapy  <cit> . in contrast, we observed normal th <dig> levels for patients with untreated aml. in addition we observed that functional th <dig> cells could be detected during severe therapy-induced cytopenia, and these frequencies did not differ from healthy controls although the variation range was broader. studies of absolute and relative th <dig> levels in a second patient cohort confirmed that only minor variations were seen during therapy-induced cytopenia. the decreased th17:treg ratio during cytopenia is thus caused by relatively stable th <dig> absolute levels with only minor decreases and maintained or increasing absolute levels of treg cells . finally, we observed increased il17-a release by circulating cells in response to stimulation by t cell specific antibodies ; this is probably caused by t cell release because il17-a release from other cells in response to these t cell specific stimulatory signals seems less likely. our overall results thereby strongly suggest that neither the leukemia nor the chemotherapy has any selective suppressive effect on th <dig> cells compared with other t cell subsets. release of il17-a from other cells than t cells activated in response to these stimulatory signals seems less likely.

immunosuppressive cd4+ treg cells inhibit effector t cells and nk cells  <cit> . depletion of treg cells enhances murine anti-cancer immunity  <cit>  as well as vaccine-induced anticancer reactivity in humans  <cit> . increased levels of circulating treg cells seem to occur in untreated aml  <cit> , although these previous studies did not analyze foxp3+ cells. we observed increased levels of circulating foxp3+ treg cells in patients with untreated aml. even though previous studies suggest that at least certain cytotoxic drugs can reduce the levels of circulating treg cells  <cit> , our present results showed that the frequencies of treg cells were increased before and following intensive aml chemotherapy. studies in a second cohort of patients demonstrated that the absolute levels of treg cells even increased during cytopenia for certain patients. this was true even for patients regenerating after therapy, an observation that is also supported by another study  <cit> . the relative levels of cd4+ cd25high treg cell were also increased in untreated aml and during cytopenia. the variations of various t cell subsets relative to treg cells then suggest that the various subsets are differentially affected, and the increased treg levels may then be caused either by treg proliferation or development from t cell progenitors or other t cell subsets.

we observed a correlation between the levels of th <dig> and tc <dig> cells both for aml patients and healthy controls, and this correlation was maintained during severe therapy-induced cytopenia. in contrast, the correlation between th <dig> and th <dig> levels was detected only for aml patients with untreated disease and therapy-induced cytopenia. these observations further support the hypothesis that various t cell subsets are differentially affected in aml patients.

the levels of circulating th <dig> cells were significantly higher in males than females for healthy controls, and th <dig> cells were also higher in males for elderly controls. in a recent gene expression study of activated t cells the responsiveness was generally higher in women than in men, but il17-a was the only effector gene that showed highest expression in men  <cit> . estrogen response elements in the promoter regions of several immune genes could possibly explain the gender differences  <cit> . this gender differences reached only borderline statistical significance for patients with untreated aml and could not be detected in our cytopenic patients. thus, the influence of gender differences on circulating t cell subsets becomes less important after chemotherapy.

exogenous il17-a had no or only weak effects on functional aml cell characteristics; even though some differences were statistically significant their biological significance can be questioned. even though the relative levels of th <dig> cells are maintained after chemotherapy, we conclude that th <dig> cells may affect aml cells indirectly through their immunoregulatory effects; whereas direct effects of il17-a on the leukemic cells probably do not have any major impact.

CONCLUSIONS
to conclude, aml patients have an altered distribution of circulating t cell subsets; this is due to both disease-associated and chemotherapy-induced alterations whereas gender-dependent differences in th <dig> and th <dig> levels become less important after intensive chemotherapy. our results suggest that treg cells are relatively resistant to intensive aml therapy as increased levels persist even during the period of severe cytopenia. previous studies suggest a prognostic impact of treg cells in aml patients receiving intensive chemotherapy, but our present results suggest that the altered treg levels are only a part of a more complex immunological phenotype in these patients. taken together our studies strongly suggest that the possible prognostic impact of variations in circulating t cell subsets should be addressed in future clinical studies.
