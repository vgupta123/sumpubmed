BACKGROUND
wild waterfowl serve as the natural reservoir for type a influenza viruses and play an important role in the persistence and transmission of these viruses among birds and other mammalian species. influenza a viruses are classified into subtypes based on two surface proteins, the hemagglutinin  and neuraminidase . at least  <dig> hemagglutinins  and  <dig> neuraminidases  have been found in ai viruses from birds  <cit> , while two additional ha and na types have been identified only in bats  <cit> . influenza viruses in birds are classified as either low pathogenic avian influenza  or highly pathogenic avian influenza  viruses. the hpai viruses that produce acute clinical disease in chickens, turkeys and other birds belong to either h <dig> and h <dig> subtypes. many different subtypes of ai viruses resulting from the combination of the  <dig> ha and  <dig> na antigens have been found in wild waterfowl  <cit> . low pathogenic ai viruses of h <dig> or h <dig> subtypes also may persist in wild ducks, which may evolve into hpai viruses. the ancestor of the currently circulating h5n <dig> hpai viruses was first detected in bar-headed goose in guangdong province, china in  <dig>  following some genetic recombinations, the global dissemination of this h5n <dig> virus began in  <dig> with devastating consequences for the poultry industry  <cit> . in bangladesh h5n <dig> hpai virus was first detected in  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig> outbreaks have been reported to oie until now  <cit> . most of the outbreaks were in chickens, but clinical disease also has been observed in quails, crows, ducks and geese . three different genetic clades of hpai h5n <dig> virus, namely clade  <dig> ,  <dig> . <dig> and  <dig> . <dig>  were detected  <cit> . as of  <dig> july  <dig>   <dig> human cases of h5n <dig> ai virus with one case fatality have been reported from bangladesh  <cit> . in addition to h5n <dig> hpai, low pathogenic h9n <dig> influenza virus also has been circulating in poultry .

total population of domestic ducks  in bangladesh is  <dig>  million  <cit> . ducks are reared either in scavenging or semi-intensive system. in scavenging system chickens and ducks are usually reared in the same household. in semi-intensive system ducks are brought to the rivers and lakes for feeding, where they get a chance to mingle with the wild waterfowl. thus ai viruses can transmit from wild waterfowl to domestic ducks. the present paper reports on the serosurveillance and molecular detection and characterization of ai viruses from domestic ducks in north-eastern districts of bangladesh.

methods
sample collection
an ai surveillance programme was conducted by the department of livestock services , bangladesh in collaboration with several national laboratories with assistance from the food and agriculture organisation  of the united nations in  <dig>  the samples we used in this study were collected through this surveillance platform. this surveillance program targeted ducks and swine population of the country. samples collected by dls veterinarians from different regions of the country were sent to the nearby national laboratories. our laboratory was entrusted with the responsibility of analyzing samples from the north-western region of bangladesh including mymensingh division  and sylhet division  . duck rearing is popular in this region because of the presence of many natural waterbodies. with the exception of netrokona district there was no clinical outbreak of ai in ducks during the period from  <dig> to  <dig>  serum samples and cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs of  <dig> and  <dig> domestic scavenging or semi-scavenging ducks of more than 8 weeks of age from the mymensingh and sylhet division, respectively, were collected during the period from january to august  <dig>  cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs were placed individually in cryovials containing virus transport medium. the transport medium was prepared with dulbecco’s modified eagle medium supplemented with hepes , l-glutamine , gentamycin , sulfamethoxazole , ofloxacin , polymyxin b , amphotericin b  and bovine serum albumin . the samples were shipped to the laboratory either in a cooler with ice pack or in liquid nitrogen, depending on the time required for transportation. blood samples were also collected from the wing vein of the ducks. the blood was allowed to clot and the serum was separated by centrifugation using a portable centrifuge, and shipped to the laboratory maintening the cool chain as mentioned above.fig.  <dig> the map of bangladesh showing the areas of sample collection . 




detection of antibodies to influenza virus
a blocking elisa kit  was used to measure antibodies to type a influenza virus in all the duck serum samples according to manufacturer’s instruction. positive and negative control samples provided with the test kit were included on each plate. serum samples with a sample-to-negative control  absorbance ratio less than  <dig>  were considered positive.

a total of  <dig> serum samples out of  <dig> elisa-positive samples were randomly selected. the selected samples had a wide range of elisa values; s/n absorbance ratio  <dig> – <dig>  ,  <dig> – <dig>  ,  <dig> – <dig>   and  <dig> – <dig>  . these samples were tested for antibodies to h <dig> avian influenza virus by haemagglutination-inhibition  test. the h <dig> antigen  was obtained from the national reference laboratory for avian influenza, bangladesh livestock research institute, savar, dhaka. the hi test was performed as described in oie manual  <cit> .

molecular detection of avian influenza virus
viral rna was extracted from swab samples with kingfisher ml automated rna extraction machine  using ambion magmax viral rna isolation kit . extraction protocol provided by the kit manufacturer was adapted to kingfisher ml automated rna extraction machine.

all samples were first screened for the presence of type a influenza virus by taqman real time rt-pcr for m gene  <cit> . the real time rt-pcr was performed on ab  <dig> fast real time pcr machine . the reaction was performed in microamp optical  <dig> well fast pcr plates using agpath-id™ one step rt-pcr kit  following manufacturer’s instruction. the primer and probe sequences are given in table  <dig> table  <dig> oligonucleotide primers and probes used in rt-pcr




all m gene positive samples were then tested for h <dig> avian influenza virus by conventional rt-pcr for h <dig> gene  <cit> . the one step rt-pcr was performed on eppendorf mastercycler gradient thermocycler  using superscript® iii one-step rt-pcr system with platinum® taq dna polymerase  following manufacturer’s instruction. the primer sequences are given in table  <dig> 

attempted propagation of virus in chicken embryos
propagation of virus in chicken embryos from m gene positive samples was attempted following the standard procedure of embryo inoculation by the allantoic route  <cit> . the growth of virus in the allantoic fluid was checked by haemagglutination test and rt-pcr. one more blind passage was performed for negative samples.

sequencing of ha and na gene
the virus that could be grown in embryos was sent to oie-fao reference laboratory, padova, italy for genetic characterization. if any m gene posititive sample could not be propagated in embryos, then the rna isolated from the original swab sample was used for direct amplification of full-length or partial ha and na genes by one step rt-pcr using universal primer set  <cit>  and superscript® iii one-step rt-pcr system with platinum® taq dna polymerase . primer sequences are given in table  <dig>  amplified cdna was cleaned by gel extraction method using wizard® sv gel and pcr clean-up system  according to manufacturer’s instruction. the purified rt-pcr products were sequenced in a commercial laboratory  using pcr primers.

phylogenetic analysis
the raw sequence data were first checked for its quality and then edited and assembled using softwares chromas , lasergene editseq and megalign . edited sequences were subjected to blast search in the genbank to find the sequences closely related to the sequences established in the present study. ha and na sequences of the same subtype representing different genetic lineages were downloaded from the genbank and used in phylogenetic analysis. the multiple alignment using clustal w algorithym and construction of maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree were performed with mega  <dig>  software .

RESULTS

virological surveillance and molecular characterization of the virus
for virological surveillance all the  <dig> pairs of oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs from ducks of mymensingh division and  <dig> pairs  of oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs from ducks of sylhet division were tested for m gene of type a influenza virus by rrt-pcr. the remaing  <dig> pairs of samples from sylhet division could not be tested due to shortage of reagents. only six samples  including one oropharyngeal swab and  <dig> cloacal swabs were positive for type a influenza virus; all the positive samples were from mymensingh division. however, all the  <dig> m gene positive samples were negative for h <dig> gene on rt-pcr.

out of  <dig> m gene positive samples, only one  could be successfully propagated in chicken embryos. this sample was charactecterized as h7n <dig> virus at oie-fao reference laboratory for avian influenza, padova, italy. the laboratory has made the ha gene sequence of this isolate publicly available in the genbank . examination of the deduced amino acid sequence reveals that this h7n <dig> virus is a low pathogenic one with cleavage site sequence pelpkgr*glf. the ha gene sequence of this isolate was downloaded from the genbank and included in phylogenetic analysis in the present study.

for the remaining  <dig> samples, which were positive for m gene in rrt-pcr but could not be propagated in embryos, molecular characterization was attempted from the rna extracted from the original swab samples. we were successful in amplifying nearly full-length na gene  and partial ha gene  from two samples  by rt-pcr . nucleotide sequence of the amplified rt-pcr products were established and submitted to genbank . amplification of full-length ha gene was not successful. the amplified 640 bp fragment of the ha gene was from the 3′ end and that did not cover the cleavage site. blast search for homology in the genbank revealed that the virus from the sample 18-c and 33-o belonged to h1n <dig> and h2n <dig> subtype of avian influenza virus, respectively. the summary results of molecular characterization of the viruses are presented in table  <dig> fig.  <dig> amplification of ha  and na  gene of avian influenza virus by rt-pcr for sequencing.

discussion
wild aquatic birds are the natural reservoir of all influenza a viruses  <cit> . domestic ducks also have been shown to harbour many subtypes of avian influenza viruses and allow their reassortments  <cit> . the present study revealed a widespread seroconversion of domestic ducks to type a influenza virus with an overall seroprevalence of  <dig> % in mymensingh and  <dig> % in sylhet division in  <dig>  another study reported  <dig> % seroprevalence of type a avian influenza virus in semi-scavenging ducks of sylhet hakaluki haor and jahangirnagar university lake areas during winter months of  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . on further investigation of selected serum samples by hi test for h <dig> antibodies only  <dig> % of elisa-positive samples were positive for h <dig> antibodies using hi titre > <dig> as the cut-off titre for h5-specific antibodies. in west bengal of india  <dig> % ducks were found to be seropositive in hi test for h <dig> ai considering > <dig> as the cut-off titre  <cit> .

on virological surveillance only one oropharyngeal swab and five cloacal swabs out of  <dig> sampled ducks from mymensingh division were found positive for type a influenza virus m gene by rrt-pcr. no positive sample was found from sylhet division. this prevalence rate of type a influenza virus in domestic ducks is quite low  as compared to that reported by others in domestic ducks of bangladesh, such as  <dig> %  <cit> ,  <dig> %  <cit>  and  <dig> out of  <dig>   <cit> . this variation might be due to the different time period of sampling. in the present study the samples were collected during january to august,  <dig>  where as in the previous studies the samples were collected during the period from  <dig> to  <dig> 

all of the  <dig> m gene positive samples of the present study were negative for h <dig>  attempted propagation of these m gene positive samples in embryos was not successful with the exception of one sample . this failure to isolate the virus could be due to very low concentration of virus in the samples. the only embryo-propagated sample 22-c was characterized as low pathogenic h7n <dig> at oie-fao reference laboratory, padova, italy. among the remaining  <dig> m gene-positive but culture-negative swab samples, it was possible to amplify a 640 bp fragment of ha gene and nearly full-length  na gene from two samples . the sample 18-c was characterized as subtype h1n <dig> and the sample 33-o as subtype h2n <dig>  aquatic birds are known to harbour a wide variety of avian influenza viruses. so the detection of viruses of three different subtypes  is not surprising. in an earlier study  <dig> different subtypes of lpai viruses including h1n <dig>  h1n <dig>  h2n <dig>  h3n <dig>  h3n <dig>  h3n <dig>  h4n <dig>  h4n <dig>  h5n <dig>  h6n <dig>  h6n <dig>  h7n <dig>  h9n <dig> and h11n <dig> were identified from domestic ducks of bangladesh  <cit> . isolation of h1n <dig>  h1n <dig> and h1n <dig> viruses have been reported from wild and domestic ducks in korea  <cit> , h1n <dig> and h1n <dig> viruses from free-range ducks in thailand  <cit>  and h2n <dig> and h2n <dig> virus from domestic ducks in china  <cit> . it was interesting that the n gene component of all of the three viruses  detected in the present study was n <dig>  however, in the previous study  <cit>  all the different n subtypes except n <dig> were detected in domestic ducks of bangladesh. taken together, the findings of these two studies reveal that all the 9 n genes are present in domestic ducks of bangladesh. phylogenetically the ha gene of h1n <dig>  h2n <dig> and h7n <dig> viruses belonged to eurasian avian lineages as observed in the previous study  <cit> . the ha gene of h7n <dig> was distinct from the ha gene of the newly emerged influenza a virus. the n <dig> gene of h1n <dig> and h2n <dig> viruses were very similar and also belonged to eurasian lineage; the na gene sequence of h7n <dig> virus was not available.

CONCLUSIONS
present study shows that  <dig> % of the ducks were seropositive for antibodies to type a influenza virus and a small proportion of type a influenza virus positive ducks  had previous exposure to h <dig> subtype viruses, probably h5n <dig> hpai or h5n <dig> lpai viruses. active shedding of ai virus at the time of the study was very limited . three viruses were characterized as h1n <dig>  h2n <dig> and h7n <dig> subtypes and no h5n <dig> virus was detected. findings of the present study warrant further detailed surveillance on avain influenza virus in ducks for better understanding of the ecology of avian influenza viruses in domestic duck population.
