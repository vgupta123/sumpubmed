BACKGROUND
human induced pluripotent stem cells hold great promise in regenerative medicine, disease modeling, and drug discovery  <cit> . however, the ips cell generation efficiency is extremely low at around  <dig> from  <dig>  parental cells  <cit> , limiting its' use. also, such a low efficiency suggests that major factors in de-differentiation or reprogramming have not been identified yet. recently, a series of breakthrough discoveries have brought to attention that, blocking the important tumor suppressor protein p <dig>  and its downstream pathways, dramatically improves generation efficiency of induced pluripotent stem cells  <cit> . the data suggest that p <dig> is a key link between cellular reprogramming and tumor formation since it prevents differentiated cells from transforming into pluripotent stem cells.

in  <dig>  we found that p <dig> induced differentiation of mouse embryonic stem  cells by inhibiting a core transcription factor, nanog, in the presence of stresses  <cit> . nanog is a key es cell transcription factor; loss of nanog expression led to rapid differentiation  <cit> . the p <dig> protein directly binds to the nanog promoter to suppress its' expression level and thereby initiate es cell differentiation into somatic like cells. therefore, p <dig> acts as a transcription switch because it is able to inhibit es cells with genetic defects to self-renew causing them to differentiate into non-stem cells, and execute high efficient apoptosis  <cit> .

previous research by yamanaka and group reported that up to 10% transduction of p <dig> mouse embryonic fibroblasts  can be generatedinto ips cells  <cit> . p <dig> gene deletion enhances efficiency about 1000-fold. in addition, p <dig> activity can also provide sufficient conditions to turn the terminal differentiated t lymphocytes into ips cells. another research team found that replacing transcription factors cmyc and klf <dig> with p <dig> gene knockout, was enough to generate ips cells  <cit> . thus, p <dig> is the major inhibitor of ips cell generation. p <dig> is a p <dig> family member with similar sequence and function as p <dig>  <cit> . however, previous studies showed that p <dig> has rare genetic mutation events in cancers or other conditions. in addition, the p <dig> gene expresses products with two alternative promoters, transactivation p <dig>   <cit> . tap <dig> functions similar to p <dig> in that it may play a role in cancer suppression. conversely, dnp <dig> functions as an oncogene by inhibiting both p73- and p53-induced apoptosis  <cit> .

therefore, how can there be opposing roles in human ips cell generation? we propose that p <dig> might be involved in human reprogramming. we further suggest that, dnp <dig> might increase the efficiency of human ips cell generation.

RESULTS
dnp <dig> overexpression enhanced human ips cell generation
as control treatments, we applied conditions that were reported before by traditional four transcription factors [oct <dig>  sox <dig>  cmyc, and klf <dig>  referred 4tf  <cit> . to see if the dnp <dig> enhances human ips cell generation, dnp <dig> was cloned by pcr from cdna and inserted into the pmxs vector. next, the newly generated vector was transduced with 4tf together into human fibroblast cell bj.

at day  <dig>  in the traditional 4tf conditions, the efficiency of ips cell generation was at  <dig> from  <dig>  levels from human fibroblasts bj, similar to previous reports  <cit> .

in sharp contrast, at day  <dig> after infection, the fully reprogrammed es like ips cell colonies generated in 4tf plus dnp <dig> infected cultures yielded  <dig>  colonies versus control cultures which yielded  <dig>  colonies per  <dig>  parental cell seeded. this translates into a  <dig>  fold enhancement by the reprogrammed es like ips cells . furthermore, the es like ips cells tested positive for human es cell marker nanog, determined by using tra-1- <dig>  which dramatically increased nanog gene expression in the culture mixture , suggesting the cell cultures were strongly enhanced toward ips cell generation. the expression of dnp <dig> gene enhanced fibroblast reprogramming suggest that p <dig> may also play an important role in human ips cell generation, at least when transduced with traditional 4tf in human fibroblast cells by the traditional human ips cell generation method.

the human ips cells were identified with self-renewal and pluripotency
to test the pluripotent stem cell property of self-renewal, the ipsc cells were passaged. after  <dig> passages, the ips cells did not have morphological changes when their properties were characterized. cell morphology was examined with alp staining  and real time pcr gene expression. real time pcr results showed that these cells are similar to human embryonic stem cells hues <dig>  which have the same or similar gene expression levels . the results show that immunohistochemical staining results of the ips cells were similar to human es cells, with strong expressed oct3/ <dig> and nanog .

to test in vitro differentiation potential, an embryonic body mediated differentiation of ips cells experimental methods was applied. the results showed that these ips cells can be differentiated into derivatives of all three germ layers, including mesoderm, endoderm and ectoderm . these cells are brachyury positive, a conserved role in mesoderm differentiation, and establish the embryonic mesodermal progenitor . the endoderm cells are marked by early expression of the gene pdx <dig> . the immunocytochemistry also showed cells positive for tuj <dig> stained ectoderm cells .

to test pluripotency in vivo, human ips cells were transplanted by injection into the kidney of immunodeficiency  mice. after  <dig> weeks, histological sections from teratomas generated in nude mice from ips cells consisted of tissues from all three germ layers stained with hematoxylin and eosin . using 400× magnification, three germ layers of cell lines were identified, including mesoderm  , endoderm  ; ectoderm  .

resistance from differentiation cues was found in the human ips cells generated with dnp73
we observed ips cell differentiation under microscope at objective fields of 100× or 200×. each sample of teratoma was randomly observed for  <dig> microscopic fields. we found that the ips cell with dnp <dig> was resistant to in vivo differentiation , which contained all undifferentiated cells in some microscopic fields . we compared the  <dig> types of teratoma by randomly picking  <dig> microscopic fields. in control cells, all  the microscopic fields had evidence of specific cells. however, the dnp <dig> derived teratoma had fewer differentiated cells, with only 20% of the fields containing all non-specific cellsand the majority of the sections contained non-differentiated cells, 30-100% ratio. on the contrary, less than 30% non-specific cells were found in the teratoma derived from control ipsc .

in vitro differentiation demonstrated a strong difference between the cells derived from 4tf only ips cells and those derived from ips cells with additionally transduced dnp <dig>  neuronal marker cells stained by tuj  <dig> antibody were observed from all  <dig> of the tested fields in 4tf transduced cells. however,  <dig> out of  <dig> fields stained negative in those derived from ips cell with  <dig> tf plus dnp <dig>  furthermore, we did not find any typical bipolar tuj <dig> strong expression neuronal cells. the data suggest that the dnp <dig> ips cells are strongly resistant to neuronal differentiation.

dnp <dig> increased es cell core transcription factor nanog expression
to find out how the p <dig> gene can improve the efficiency of ips cells, we examined luciferase expression in mouse es cells . using our previous experimental system  <cit> , the exogenous expression of p <dig> in mouse es cells resulted in significant inhibition of the nanog promoter-driven luciferase gene expression. we carried out tap <dig> expression in the same cells, and found results similar to those from p <dig> transfected cells . however, in sharp contrast, dnp <dig> significantly increased nanog gene promoter-driven luciferase levels . this data suggests that dnp <dig> directly contributes to the nanog gene expression; thereby dnp <dig> has greatly improved the efficiency of pluripotent stem cells induction. nanog is a key es cell transcription factor. its over expression also might enhances and improves other core es cell transcription factors such as oct <dig> expression in previous studies  <cit> .

discussion
we found, for the first time, that additional expression of dnp <dig> significantly increased human ips cell generation by  <dig>  folds, and also increased the kinetics, from  <dig> days to  <dig> days. these findings suggests that p <dig> is an important factor involved in the generation of human ips cells. furthermore, p <dig> has a unique dual mechanism, whereby dnp <dig> acts as an oncogene and increases ips cell efficiency and kinetics, while tap <dig> functions similarly to p <dig> in tumor suppression.

the strong impact of p <dig> on the ips cell generation was discovered previously  <cit>  and kawamura and group  <cit>  showed that cells deficient in the p <dig> gene expression simplified the ips cell generation requirement with two factors: oct <dig> and sox <dig>  in this study, we found that dnp <dig> had a similar effect of enhancement on ips cell generation as p <dig>  this system can also be applied to detect whether c-terminal splicing proteins of p <dig> or another p <dig> member, such as p <dig>  are also important for ips cell generation or cell differentiation.

grob et al.  <cit>  found that dnp <dig> is capable of regulating the function of both tap <dig> and p <dig> and is also strongly up-regulated by the ta isoforms and by p <dig>  creating a feedback loop that tightly regulates the function of tap <dig> and p <dig>  in this study, our data strongly indicate that dnp <dig> expression decreases both p <dig> and tap <dig>  leading to an increase in nanog gene expression, which subsequently benefits somatic cell reprogramming and enhances ips cell differentiation resistance. the data also further suggests that dnp <dig> can be involved in tumorgenesis, at least teratoma-tumorgenesis. more extensive analysis of the expression pattern of dnp <dig> in other tumors and how the feedback loop is broken will require further studies.

theunissen and silva review  <cit>  on nanog expression findings as follows: the loss of nanog alleles are more prone to differentiate but do not lose pluripotency per se; nanog is transiently required for the specification of the naive pluripotent epiblast and is also essential to finalize somatic cell reprogramming during induction of pluripotency; nanog acts as a molecular switch to turn on the naive pluripotent programme in mammalian cells. however, nanog expression also enforces tumor genesis in some recent researches. most recently, a study by grad i, et al. found that nanog pre-induction followed by oct3/ <dig>  sox <dig>  myc, and klf <dig> induction resulted in tumour-inducing phenotype  <cit> . moon jh et al.  <cit>  reported that nanog-induced dedifferentiation of p53-deficient mouse astrocytes into brain cancer stem-like cells. those results underline the importance of a re-examination of the role of nanog during reprogramming. our results show that dnp <dig> derived ips cells might increase nanog expression. consequently, the capacity of nanog to resist differentiation can be regarded as a recapitulation of specification of somatic cell reprogramming, thus, resulting in a more teratomacarcinoma-like cell due to nanog over expression. the results further indicate that p <dig> family members, including dnp <dig>  might be key factors in reprogramming and cancer development. therefore, our data provides a better understanding into tumour formation and cancer stem cell transformation, at least teratomatumorgenesis.

during ips cell generation, global epigenetic modifications and chromatin changes, include histone modifications, dna methylation, and chromatin remodeling  <cit> . patterson et al.  <cit>  found that genes normally unique to early embryoswere not fully silenced in human ips cell derivatives. lin <dig> is an mrna binding protein expressed in embryonic stem cells , and is one of the key transcription factors for ips cell generation  <cit> . our results showed that dnp <dig> might be involved in the generation and in vitro differentiation of the ips cells, suggesting, a link among epigenetic modifications, ips cell gene expression and dnp <dig> in ips cell generation and early embryonic development. however, the impact of dnp <dig> on epigenetic changes during ips cell generation and derived cell lines has not been studied yet. a rapidly accumulating body of evidence suggests that there are important epigenetic differences between these two cell types, which seem to influence their tumorigenicity  <cit> . therefore further studies on these epigenetic modifications will be very interesting.

with small molecules, we developed an efficient set of human-induced pluripotent stem cell methods that improve ipsc generation by over 200-fold and cut ipsc formation time in half  <cit> . our results show tgf beta, mek, wnt and rock signaling pathway inhibition or interference might strongly impact ips cell generation efficiency and kinetics  <cit> . whether one or more of these pathways are shared with dnp <dig> needs further investigation.

should ips cells be applied to clinical application for effective treatment of human diseases? the most suspicious concerns are that ips cells might be cancer prone. more and more data suggests that ips cells are very similar to human tumor cells in the epigenetics as well as genetic mutation accumulated during the generation process. hong et al. study found that some p <dig> inactivation in ips cells produced tumors  <cit> . genetic safety is very critical for regenerative medicine. further studies might be necessary to decipher whether the over expressed dnp <dig> is involved in the tumorigenesis, and how p <dig> functions in the normal ips cells? it is not clear whether the p <dig> family members are a foe or friend in ips cell generation and clinical application  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
dnp <dig> significantly increases human ipsc generation, and also increases the kinetics. therefore, other p <dig> family members, such as dnp <dig>  are also involved in human ipsc generation. although the human ips cell generated with extra expression of dnp <dig> could differentiate into some cell lines under certain conditions, these cells were more resistant to in vitro and in vivo differentiation cues.

many other related questions, such as other p <dig> family members, the splicing variations, ips cell generation efficiency mechanisms, related epigenetics and their interactions need to be studied.
