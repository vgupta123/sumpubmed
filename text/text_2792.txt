BACKGROUND
the recent development of genome editing techniques, such as zinc finger nucleases, talens and crispr-cas <dig>  is revolutionizing the way that molecular biologists interrogate the functionality of the eukaryotic genome. the most exciting and rapidly expanding of these technologies, crispr-cas <dig> was only developed last year, yet it has already had a huge impact on basic science research, biotechnology and holds huge promise for medicine
 <cit> . crispr-cas <dig> genome editing is based on the type ii crispr adaptive immune pathway that is utilized by streptococcus pyogenes, to defend against bacteriophage infection
 <cit> . this simple two-part system consists of a customizable guide rna that directs the cas <dig> endonuclease to a genomic locus, causing double stranded dna breaks 
 <cit> . these dsbs are subsequently repaired through either, non-homologous end joining  or homology directed repair , resulting in the introduction of mutations into the targeted locus
 <cit> . by modifying this endogenous immune pathway, crispr-cas <dig> genome editing allows the generation of insertion or deletion  mutations, the deletion of large genomic loci, such as entire exons, and the introduction of specific small dna changes, such as snps
 <cit> . other variant forms of cas <dig> protein have also been generated through mutation its catalytic domain. for example, the catalytically inactive version of the cas <dig>  can be used to interfere with target gene expression, activate or overexpress target genes or visualize genomic loci
. the relatively high efficiency and broad applicability of this technology has opened the door to experiments that were hitherto not possible. these include genetic engineering in non-model organisms
 <cit> , perturbing entire gene families or regulatory networks in a single experiment
 <cit>  and correcting disease mutations in vivo
 <cit> . these studies have and will continue to provide insights into how the genome is structured, regulated and can be modified to prevent or cure disease.

in particular, crispr-cas <dig> technology is ideal for genetic engineering of cultured cells, as has been demonstrated by its successful implementation in various studies
 <cit> . the entire experimental process from design to the identification of mutant cell clones can be completed within 4 weeks, at a relatively low cost
 <cit> . the general crispr-cas <dig> protocol for genetic engineering of cultured cells involves: the design of guide rnas to target the locus of interest, construction of expression cassettes containing cas <dig> and the guide rna, transfection of the crispr-cas <dig> construct into cells of interest, selection of transfected-clones , expansion of positive clones in culture and finally screening for the desired crispr induced mutations . the most time-consuming, labour intensive and costly stage in the crispr-cas <dig> methodology involves screening and identification of mutant cell clones.

currently crispr-cas <dig> induced mutations are identified through pcr amplification of targeted regions followed by cloning into plasmids and sanger sequencing, or deep sequencing using amplicon-based kits, such as the nextera xt dna sequencing kit
 <cit> . plasmid cloning and sanger sequencing is time consuming, laborious, relatively expensive and provides limited information on the heterogeneity of the clone, while the currently available deep sequencing kits are relatively expensive and are specific to particular sequencing platforms.

in this paper we propose a cheap, high-throughput strategy for screening individual clones using next-generation sequencing. we also demonstrate the utility of this approach by identifying mutants for the homeobox gene, evx <dig> in mouse embryonic stem  cells. this method allows the screening of up to  <dig> clones in a single sequencing run. in our methodology we use the iontorrent pgm, however this strategy is generalizable and could also be adapted for use on other next-generation sequencing platforms.

RESULTS
developing a cheap, high-throughput screening strategy for crispr-cas9
the preparation of barcoded dna libraries is generally achieved either through the ligation of unique barcode and adaptor sequences to fragmented dna
 <cit> , or by incorporating barcode and adaptor sequences into pcr primers, so that the barcodes and the appropriate adaptors are added to the pcr product during the amplification process
 <cit> . the ligation strategy is generally utilized when the sample contains a complex pool of dna fragments, or when the identity of the dna fragments is unknown, for example in a chipseq experiment. whereas, when the region to be sequenced is small and the number of samples is large, it is practical to incorporate barcodes and adaptors into “fusion” pcr primers. however, “fusion primers” can become prohibitively expensive as the number of samples to be sequenced in parallel increases. often over ~50- <dig> nucleotides in length, they require more extensive purification steps to ensure that the majority of the primers are full-length and contain the complete sequencing adaptor sequences. in order to create a more cost-effective amplicon library for multiplexing a large number of crispr-cas <dig> clones, we used a hybrid approach, in which the dna barcode is included in the primer, along with a target specific sequence, while the sequencing platform specific adaptors are ligated in a subsequent reaction .figure  <dig> 
barcoded library preparation strategy. forward and reverse pcr primers were designed with a unique ~10 nt barcode along with a ~20 nt site specific sequence, which will amplify around the crispr-cas <dig> targeted site. in the first pcr cycle, either the forward or reverse barcode is added to end of the pcr product. in the second pcr cycle, the opposite barcode is added to each pcr product. in each subsequent cycle, both the forward and reverse barcodes are amplified along with the targeted region. after the pcr, sequencing platform specific adaptors are ligated to the pool of barcoded amplicons in a single reaction.



since the nhej repair pathway results in indels of various sizes at the crispr-cas <dig> targeted site, we reasoned that screening primers should be designed to create an amplicon over the targeted region and cover as much of the surrounding dna as possible. for the iontorrent pgm, we decided on an amplicon length of 200 bps, maximizing our ability to detect a variety of mutations, while ensuring that the majority of the reads reach the forward and reverse barcode.

we used a row and column based barcoding system, to reduce the number of primers required for screening. by using  <dig> barcoded forward primers  and  <dig> barcoded reverse primers , it is possible to create a uniquely barcoded amplicon for up to  <dig> clones . we chose to use the barcode sequences from the published ionxpress barcode set, as they have been optimized to work with the flow set of bases used by the ion torrent pgm. using this barcoding system requires a total of only  <dig> primers, each approximately  <dig> nucleotides in length.figure  <dig> 
crispr-cas <dig> screening workflow. duplicate  <dig> well plates of cell clones are generated. one plate is frozen down or maintained for later use. from the other plate, genomic dna is extracted, and the targeted region is amplified and uniquely barcoded in each well. the dna is then pooled, adaptors ligated, and a fragment library is prepared. the sequencing library is then sequenced on the iontorrent pgm. reads are filtered and visualized on igv, to identify the desired clones. the desired clones are then thawed and/or expanded for subsequent experiments.



screening for crispr-cas <dig> induced mutations in evx1
in order to demonstrate the applicability of our screening strategy, we generated mutant mes cells for the homeobox gene, evx <dig>  which has previously been shown to be dispensable for mouse embryonic development
 <cit> . an overview of our general screening methodology is shown in figure 
 <dig> 

after transfection, sorting and expansion of crispr-cas <dig> targeted clones, we amplified the targeted region of evx <dig> using barcoded forward and reverse primers. we validated the amplification of evx <dig> in a number of clones using one set of barcoded primers . using the aforementioned strategy, we then amplified  <dig> clones, each with a unique barcoded identity, in a  <dig> well plate format. dna was pooled from each of the wells in equal proportion, and quantified prior to template library preparation. we neglected to normalise the quantity of dna from each pcr product, as we reasoned the efficiency of pcr from each clone would likely be similar and that even with discrepancies in the concentration of dna, we would achieve sufficient sequencing coverage of the least abundant clone to identify the crispr induced mutations. sequencing adaptors  were ligated to the pooled dna, and the library was then sequenced on the iontorrent pgm. to determine the mutations present in each clone, it was necessary to de-multiplex the samples. we achieved this by writing a custom script in the r programming language that makes use of the open source ‘shortread’ package available from the bioconductor website . we applied this script to our data, which produces a separate fastq file for each individual clone and then mapped all of the fastq files to mm <dig> using bowtie <dig> 

sufficient coverage was achieved across all  <dig> clones, enabling the identification of mutations in each clone. the amplicon coverage varied from  <dig> fold to  <dig> fold, with a mean coverage of  <dig> fold . over 95% of clones were covered between 1/5th and  <dig> times the mean coverage indicating that our sequencing coverage was fairly uniform and that equalization of the individual pcr products was not required.

we visualized the data using integrated genomics viewer  version  <dig> . <dig> and annotated the mutations by visual inspection. sequencing errors could easily be distinguished from real indels by the fact that they show an extreme strand bias and typically occur in the same position in multiple samples
 <cit>  . bona fide mutations generally map in roughly equal proportions to both strands .figure  <dig> 
visualization of crispr-cas <dig> mutant clones. a) coverage across the barcoded amplicon in a variety of different ‘knockout’ crispr-cas <dig> clones. the wildtype clone has full coverage over the whole amplicon, while the mutant clones have variable indels around the targeted site. deletions are represented by a gap in the coverage, insertions are shown as black bars, while substitutions are shown in red. blue bars represent mismatched mapped reads, due to a large deletion. brown bars show presumed sequencing errors, which each have significant strand bias and commonly occur at the same position in multiple samples. b) the sequencing reads and coverage for clone a <dig>  which is a compound heterozygote with a 1 bp deletion on one allele and a 13 bp deletion on the other allele. the deletions at the targeted site are present at equal proportion on both strands , whereas the sequencing error upstream is present only on the red strand.



as has been reported previously, the incidence of crispr-cas <dig> induced mutations was very high  and all mutations were located close to the targeted sequence
 <cit>  . our technique allowed us to distinguish heterozygous mutants from homozygous mutants, as well as identify samples that contained more than two different types of mutations indicating a mixed clone. overall we identified  <dig> homozygous mutants,  <dig> compound heterozygotes,  <dig> heterozygotes,  <dig> wildtypes, and  <dig> clones that showed more than two different alleles .

we suspect that the mixed clones are likely the result of sorting multiple cells into a single well during the facs process or ongoing pcas <dig> activity after cell division, resulting in different mutations in each daughter cell. importantly, using our screening method, we were able to identify the presence of mixed clones, which could be missed when screening using plasmid-cloning and sanger sequencing. establishing the integrity of the derived clones is essential for downstream analysis, especially when the desired result is the complete disruption of the targeted gene. once identified, mixed clones can either be avoided in subsequent functional assays, or clonally isolated by serial dilution.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a cheap, high-throughput screening strategy for identifying crispr-cas <dig> induced mutations using next-generation sequencing. we successfully applied our strategy to identify mes cell clones with a variety of different mutations in the homeobox gene, evx <dig>  using the iontorrent pgm. we found the frequency of crispr-cas <dig> induced mutations to be very high and were able to identify  <dig> clones in which both alleles of the evx <dig> were disrupted. our methodology has numerous advantages over the current screening strategies. firstly, it is cost effective, as it requires only  <dig>  30 nt primers to uniquely barcode up to  <dig> clones, additionally, as the coverage requirements to identify crispr-cas <dig> induced mutations are quite low, it is possible to multiplex with additional samples. secondly, this method is generalizable, opening the door for deep sequencing-based mutational screening on a variety of sequencing platforms. finally, our strategy provides information on the heterogeneity of each clone , which could be missed when screening with plasmid cloning and sanger sequencing.

although in this study we have focused on screening murine cells in culture, we envision that our strategy could be widely applied to screen for crispr-cas <dig> mutants, in a variety of contexts. our strategy could be adapted to screen for mutants in crispr-cas <dig> transgenic organisms. it is also particularly well-suited for screening mutations in polyploid organisms or cell lines, as next-generation sequencing provides a global picture of all alleles. this methodology provides a further step forward in the rapidly expanding field of crispr-cas <dig> genome editing.
