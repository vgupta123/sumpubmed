BACKGROUND
lung cancer is the most common cause of neoplasia-related death worldwide  <cit> . the vast majority of lung cancer cases  are non-small cell lung cancers  and the remaining fraction is small cell lung cancers. only a minority of nsclc patients is suitable for radical treatment as curative care. approximately two thirds of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, and of the remaining patients who undergo curative surgery, 30-50% have a recurrence with metastatic disease  <cit> . the 5-year relative survival rate among patients diagnosed with nsclc is only 15%. thus, the conventional treatments , have apparently reached a plateau of effectiveness in improving survival of advanced nsclc patients  <cit> . thus, the treatment of nsclc is a major unmet need and new therapies focusing on the molecular mechanisms of lung tumorigenesis are urgently needed  <cit> .

the discovery of new biomarkers for targeted therapies could greatly change the management and prognosis of many patients with nsclc. further, knowledge of the molecular pathways and mutational drivers of lung cancer will expand the use of targeted treatments. hopefully, the identification of new therapeutic targets will provide personalized and precise treatments for lung cancer patients in the near future.

indeed, considerable efforts were made to discover new molecular biomarkers associated to lung cancer, which could be used as early diagnostic markers or as new specific therapeutic targets to treat patients  <cit> . in our opinion, the identification of oncoantigens   <cit>  could provide new and more promising targets for personalized treatment in nsclc.

in this study, we sought to identify new candidate biomarkers and/or potential oncoantigens involved in both initiation of lung cancer and/or its progression to an aggressive cancer phenotype. to this aim, we adapted to the lung cancer disease our consolidated pipeline for oncoantigen detection  <cit> . thanks to the rna-seq technology we also extended our pipeline to the detection of tumor specific transcript isoforms and fusion proteins  <cit> . our pipeline requires the availability of an animal model for the cancer under study  <cit> . thus, we used one of the models most closely simulating human metastatic lung cancer  <cit> . this model is based on the combination of a latent mutant k-ras allele at the endogenous locus , which is spontaneously activated in vivo  <cit> , and a particular mutation generated at the endogenous p <dig> allele containing an arginine-to-histidine substitution at codon  <dig> , corresponding to the hot spot mutation at human codon  <dig>  <cit> . this mouse model develops lung adenocarcinomas with a high incidence of metastases and gender differences in cancer-related death. the use of our pipeline in the framework of metastatic lung cancer model, combined with the power of rna-seq technology, allowed the identification of adora <dig> as new putative target for antibody-based therapy in mutant p <dig> tumors.

RESULTS
characterization of lung tumors of k-rasla1/p53r172hΔg mice by non invasive mri
a colony of k-rasla1/p53r172hΔg double transgenic mice has been generated in our laboratory, by crossing one p53r172hΔg male with one k-rasla <dig> female, kindly provided us by dr. lozano . these mice develop autochthonous lung adenocarcinomas with a high incidence of metastases and gender differences in cancer related death thus providing a realistic model of human metastatic lung cancer and an immunocompetent system for studying nsclc and its prevention by novel agents  <cit> . by using non-invasive imaging techniques  for small rodents, a quantification of the number and the size of tumor lesions of k-rasla1/p53r172hΔg mice during time was performed. the progression of lung tumors was monitored at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> weeks of age. tumor lesions resulted as white opaque hyper-intense regions already evident in  <dig> week-old k-rasla1/p <dig> r172hΔg male and female mice . the analysis of images collected at weeks  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> weeks of age showed a significant increase in the total tumor volume in both k-rasla1/p <dig> r172hΔg males and females during cancer progression . moreover, starting from the 10th week of age, a significant increase in the number and size of lung lesions was observed between males and females, with females developing more lesions than males, as previously reported for survival  <cit> . these gender differences remain evident from early to advanced/late-stage of the disease .

histological analysis of lung sections from normal  and  <dig> week-old k-rasla1/p53r172hΔg male and female mice showed that white opacities revealed by the mri analysis correspond to small foci of lung carcinoma growing with lepidic aspect . these early lesions increase in number and dimensions and, at  <dig> weeks of age, become sub-pleural and intra-parenchymal tumors , growing in masses with lepidic and solid growth aspects. like in humans, in which the prevalence of adenocarcinomas of mixed subtypes led, in  <dig>  to a new who classification in which invasive adenocarcinomas are classified by predominant pattern and to the routinely definition of the percentage of histologic subtypes in clinical pathological reports, at  <dig> weeks of age , lung adenocarcinomas of k-rasla1/p53r172hΔg mice display, besides a predominance of zones with solid growth , several types of differentiation, sometimes with prominent papillary growth pattern , sometimes with less differentiated zones and aspects of large cell carcinoma . immunohistochemical analyses showed that these lesions are positive for ttf- <dig> , a typical marker of adenocarcinoma  <cit> , and negative for p <dig>  a marker of squamous tumors and for synaptophysin, chromogranin, and neuron specific enolase , markers of neuroendocrine tumors  <cit> .

transcription profiling
microarray analysis
to estimate the importance of the gender effect on gene expression, we initially run a microarray experiment on lung tissues of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> week-old k-rasla1/p53r172hΔg mice, using affymetrix exon  <dig>  arrays. the comparison did not show any significant difference at the transcription level , suggesting that the differences in growth rate might be due to the endocrinological differences existing between male and female. thus, we run a pair-end rna-seq on two prototypical situations, wt and k-rasla1/p53r172hΔg mice , to detect genes/transcripts associated to the increase of tumor mass that might represent potential targets for precision medicine applications  <cit> .

fusion events detection
direct sequencing of messenger rna transcripts using the rna-seq protocol  <cit>  is rapidly becoming the standard method for detecting and quantifying expressed genes in a cell. one of the key features observed after cancer genomes analysis is a chromosomal abnormality. genome rearrangements could result in aberrant gene fusions, and a number of them have been found to play important roles in carcinogenesis  <cit> . the discovery of novel gene fusions can lead to a better comprehension of cancer progression and development. fusion events were detected in wt and mt samples using chimerascan  <cit> . since fusion detection tools are error prone  <cit> , we filtered the putative fusions, reported by chimerascan, retaining only common events between the mt and not reported in the wt replicates. the detected fusions  were subsequently discarded since they were all either read through events or fusions between homologue genes. thus it seems that fusion products are not prominent events in tumors developing due to the presence of constitutively active k-ras and inactive p <dig> 

exon-level analysis
exon level analysis was run using dexseq bioconductor package  <cit>  and provided  <dig> genes with differential exon expression between wt and mt groups . among them six  codify for proteins that were located on the plasma membrane and three  for proteins secreted in the extracellular space. for  <dig> of the  <dig> detected genes, exon-level data for  <dig> tumors together with their clinical annotation were retrieved from the cancer genome atlas . we scored the exons for their oncological power , which essentially represents the association between exon skipping/retention and poor outcome. significant correlation between exon-level expression for the above-mentioned genes and poor prognosis could not be detected .

gene-level analysis
gene-level analysis was run using deseq bioconductor package  <cit>  and provided  <dig>  genes with increased expression associated to tumor mass increment between wt and mt groups . we focused our analysis on  <dig> genes encoding for secreted and membrane bound proteins having a human ortholog . thus, we run a meta-analysis on a set of public available transcriptomes of  <dig> nsclc patients characterized by clinical outcome for survival and metastasis . the data set was divided in test and validation set, of  <dig> and  <dig> samples each, respectively. we scored the identified genes for their oncological power , which represents the association between up-modulation of a gene and poor clinical outcome.

spp <dig>  was the only molecule whose over-expression resulted statistically related to poor outcome regarding both survival and metastasis formation in nsclc patients examined . this result was further maintained in both datasets evaluating only early tumor stage samples, i.e. category t <dig> based on the tnm staging system  <cit> . these results are in accordance with previous evidences that spp <dig> is an early marker of tumor progression in nsclc  <cit> . among the identified genes, two additional molecules showed a significant over-expression in patients with poor outcome regarding metastasis formation: gm-csf  and adora <dig> .

gm-csf, the granulocyte and macrophage colony stimulating factor, is a monomeric, 4-helical, secreted cytokine known to inhibit inflammation and t-cell immunity  <cit> . it has been described to promote cancer in pancreatic ductal neoplasia when over-expressed by a constitutively active form of k-ras  <cit> , in accordance with our previously observed results in k-rasla1/p53r172hΔg mice. the association of gm-csf expression with poor outcome was obtained in the test dataset. the result could not be confirmed in the validation dataset probably due to the limited number of samples in high expression cluster . nevertheless, significance in the first dataset was maintained even only considering early stage t <dig> tumors . analysis of the supernatants from a cell line  derived from a lung tumor of a  <dig> week-old k-rasla1/p53r172hΔg mouse confirmed that they express gm-csf . taken together our data, with the observation that serum level of gm-csf is significantly higher in colon adenocarcinoma patients  <cit> , suggest that gm-csf might represent a putative early marker in lung adenocarcinoma detection.

adora <dig> is a member of a family of 7-transmembrane g-protein-coupled receptor for adenosine. it has been reported to be involved in cell cycle regulation and tumor growth control both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . it has been recently shown  <cit>  that adora <dig> is involved in the induction of p53-mediated apoptosis in lung cancer cell lines. since in our model p <dig> is inactivated, adora <dig> does not negatively affect tumor growth, but remain expressed on tumor cells. although it does not represent a suitable oncoantigen, since its expression does not strictly affect tumor behavior; however, since it is a tumor associated antigen it could represent an interesting target for the development of antibody-mediated therapy on the subset of nsclc which are p <dig> null and adora <dig> positive.

CONCLUSIONS
the combination of powerful transcriptomics analysis, i.e. rna-seq, genetically engineered mice models prone to develop tumors and large collection of human tumor transcriptomes offers new opportunities for the discovery and validation of therapeutic targets in the framework of personalized medicine. the identification of a known biomarker as osteopontin in the nsclc mouse model confirmed the efficacy of our pipeline to detect targets in precision medicine. moreover, our approach also allowed the identification of a new putative target, adora <dig>  as well as a new putative biomarker, gm-csf.
