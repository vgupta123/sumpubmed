BACKGROUND
the absorption of biologically active compounds occurs via passive transcellular, paracellular and carrier-mediated transport mechanisms  <cit> . analysis of the human genome sequence suggested the presence of  <dig> genes encoding ion channels and  <dig> genes encoding transporters  <cit> . generally, these proteins establish the electrochemical gradient across membranes and provide the means for transporting electrolytes, amino acids, dipeptides, monosaccharides, monocarboxylic acids, organic cations, phosphates, nucleosides, and water-soluble vitamins  <cit> . frequently, transporters play a direct role in the absorption of bioactive compounds from the intestinal lumen. the bioavailability of some compounds can depend significantly on carrier-mediated systems and, thus, are sensitive to drug-drug and drug-food interactions; however, these interactions tend to be more relevant for bioactive molecules with low bioavailabilities  <cit> .

the mrna expression profiles of several functionally-defined transporter families have already been measured by real-time pcr  <cit> ; yet, for a majority of biologically active compounds it remains unknown which transporters play a role in their absorption. although the human genome project has made the identification of most, if not all, genes encoding transporters and ion channels possible, only a few studies have focused on intestinal transporter expression using such genome-wide strategies  <cit> . therefore, insight into the expression profiles of transporters along the intestinal tract enables a physiologically relevant assessment of their potential as drug- and nutrient-carriers.

even less is known about the expression of transporters along the crypt-villus axis  <cit> . the extensive automated literature data mining by olsen et al.  <cit>  revealed that more transporters are known to be expressed in the villi than in the crypts. many transporters that are villus-specific have been implicated in absorption processes, such as the oligopeptide transporter slc15a <dig>  facilitated glucose transporter slc2a <dig>  and the sodium/glucose cotransporter slc5a <dig>  <cit> ; whereas the crypt-specific, basolaterally expressed na+/hco <dig> co-transporter  is essential for intestinal anion secretion. similarly, the mulitrdrug resistance protein  <dig> , is crypt-specific, basolaterally expressed and acts as a secretion pump for various compounds  <cit> . on the other hand, p-glycoprotein  is villus-specific, expressed on the apical site and acts as well as a secretion pump for a variety of drugs  <cit> . although exceptions may be found, one can assume that villus-specific transporters might be more efficient as mediators of absorption as their surface availability is more extensive.

messenger rna levels may not always correlate with the expression of encoded proteins  <cit> . although use of proteomic techniques increasingly serves to resolve discrepancies between mrna and protein levels, proteomics of integral membrane proteins still remains a challenge  <cit> . also, protein levels do not necessarily correlate with protein activity. various studies indicate that genomic profiling in combination with data mining of chemotoxicity databases can be an efficient strategy to identify new putative drug carriers  <cit> .

a first step in identifying genes relevant to drug absorption in the intestine is to obtain a molecular catalogue of all expressed mrnas. in this study, we used the high-density oligomer microarray by affymetrix to measure the mrna expression levels of genes expressed in four intestinal regions  in the mouse. we identified all genes with transporter activity according to the gene ontology  consortium system that are represented on the microarrays. then, we examined specific transporter classes that are significantly changed along the intestine and compared our findings to publicly available human microarray data. finally, the mrna expression of some selected transporters was measured along the crypt-villus axis using laser capture microdissection.

RESULTS
"carriers" and in particular "symporters" and "antiporters" are significantly changed along the a-p axis. however, he transporter class as a whole is not
even though  <dig> % of all genes on the microarray that belong to the go class "transporter activity" were differentially expressed along the intestine , the class itself, however, was not found significantly changed according to a fisher's exact test .

in  <dig> of the  <dig> transporter classes represented on the microarrays  more than  <dig> % of the genes were differentially expressed along the intestine. but only the classes "carriers", "electron" and "protein" were significantly altered  with "carriers" being the only class whose subclasses showed significant changes. in particular, genes with "electrochemical potential-driven transporter activity", and more specifically "antiporters" and "symporters" were affected along the intestine. although the class "channel/pore" was not significantly affected, it was the only transporter class  besides "carriers" that contained subclasses that varied significantly, namely "chloride channel"  and its subclass "voltage-gated chloride channel" .

atransporter activity classes  for which no changes were observed are not listed : amide , boron , drug , group translocator , lactone , nitric oxide , organic alcohol , peptidoglycan , siderochrome , toxin  and xenobiotic . blisted is the number of differentially regulated genes along the whole intestinal tract and more specifically between adjoining intestinal segments . grey cells indicate significant changes in the go nodes . ctotal number of unigene clusters being represented on the three mu74v <dig> genechips. dsum of all differentially expressed unigene clusters, i.e., from type ,  and .

expression profiles of transporters change along the whole intestinal tract, but most significantly between the ileum and colon
the number of significantly  regulated genes was not different when comparing the jejunum and ileum and the ileum and colon . however, comparisons of transporters revealed a trend that along the a-p axis the differences between the adjoining segments increased. overall, this trend could also be observed in the transporter subclasses except from the "amine/polyamine", "ion transporter" and "protein" classes. for instance, the biggest subclass in absolute numbers of differentially changed transporters was the class "carrier". along the intestine the difference between the adjoining segments increases clearly from  <dig> genes  to  <dig>  to  <dig> . the changes, however, are only significant  for the comparisons duodenum vs. jejunum and ileum vs. colon. interestingly, no significant change was observed for the nodes of the jejunum vs. ileum comparison indicating that relative to all genes being differently expressed between the jejunum and the ileum the number of differently regulated transporters was not significantly higher.

like the mother class "carriers", the number of differentially regulated "symporters" and "antiporters" also increased along the intestine. all changes were significant for both types of porters except for "symporters" in the comparison duodenum vs. jejunum .

a similar number of transporters are over-expressed in the small and in the large intestine, but generally transporters are expressed at higher levels in the small intestine than in the colon
in order to identify transporters which could be interesting candidate carriers for bioactive compounds in the various segments, we examined expression profiles along the intestinal tract. comparing the expression levels of transporter genes or genes involved in transporter activity in the small intestine and the colon revealed that similar numbers of genes were more highly expressed in either the small or the large intestine. however, small intestinal transporters were clearly more over-expressed . the majority of differentially expressed transporters are members of the solute carrier super family . the most pronounced change , however, was observed for fatty acid binding protein  <dig> . among the transporters being more than  <dig> times over-expressed in the small intestine were the neurotransmitter transporter slc6a <dig>  the sulfate transporter pendrin-like protein  <dig> , l-type amino acid transporter  <dig> , facilitated glucose transporter  <dig> , the apolipoprotein c-ii , the d11ertd18e, the retinol binding protein  <dig> , sterolin  <dig> and  <dig>  . the yl-type amino acid transporter  <dig> , the concentrative nucleoside transporter co-transporter , the b-type amino acid transporter  <dig>  were more than  <dig> times over-expressed. in the colon, the most over-expressed transporter was the neurotransmitter transporter slc6a <dig> which was more than  <dig> times higher expressed in the colon compared to the small intestine. aquaporin  <dig> , serum amyloid a  <dig> , the neurotransmitter transporter slc6a <dig>  the facilitated glucose transporter  <dig>  and aquaporin  <dig>  were more than  <dig> times over-expressed. the concentrative nucleoside transporter  <dig>  was the top five most over-expressed transporter in the small intestine compared to the colon, but its annotation quality was only classified as "medium".

ad = duodenum, j = jejunum, i = ileum, c = colon, si = small intestine, - = no data found in the literature

there are particular transporters that are clearly segment-specific. however, most differentially regulated transporters are similarly expressed along the whole small intestine
a more detailed pair-wise comparison between the adjoining segments indicated that the differences between adjoining segments, regarding changes of expression levels of transporters, increased along the intestine . most transporters that were differently expressed between the small intestine and the colon were similarly expressed along the length of the small intestine, but differently changed between the ileum and the colon; however, some transporters were clearly expressed in a region-specific manner. ferroportin  <dig>  was strongly over-expressed in the duodenum compared to the other segments. besides slc40a <dig>  the intestinal phosphate transporter  had the most pronounced fold change between jejunum and the duodenum. the expression level of slc34a <dig> increased along the small intestine, but was again more lowly expressed in the colon than in the ileum. fabp <dig> is similarly expressed in the duodenum and the jejunum, but significantly  decreased in the ileum and even more in the colon. besides the na+ dependent ileal bile acid transporter  and slc34a <dig>  the sodium transporter slc5a <dig>  a tumor suppressor gene  <cit> , was also more highly expressed in the ileum compared to the jejunum, but similarly expressed in the colon. on the other hand, fabp <dig> is the most highly expressed gene involved in transport activity in the jejunum compared to the ileum. this is followed by d11ertd18e, which has been associated to the sugar transporter super family based on its protein structure, and the facilitated glucose transporter member  <dig> . tables  <dig> and  <dig> show all transporters that were differently regulated along the intestine and whose fold changes were at least four-fold. members of the abc transporter family have not been integrated in the tables as they have been presented earlier in detail  <cit> .

most transporters are similarly expressed in mice and humans
in order to assess if the expression levels in the mouse are a suitable estimator for the situation in humans our data were compared to publicly available human microarray data obtained with a custom-array. overall,  <dig> % of all annotated transporters in mouse were compared. previous studies have shown that there is a good correlation between data obtained with the affymetrix platform and the data obtained with this custom-array  <cit> .

the majority of common orthologous transporters were similarly expressed in the small intestine and the colon in both mice and humans. some genes, however, were no less than four-fold up-regulated in at least one segment in the mouse, but were not identified as being differently regulated in humans except for low affinity na-dependent glucose transporter slc5a <dig> . other studies in humans not using microarrays, however, suggest that most of these genes have a similar expression profile in mice and humans  indicating that the fold changes measured with the custom-array may to a certain extent underestimate the true fold changes as shown earlier  <cit> .

apublished expression data are listed in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  d = duodenum, j = jejunum, i = ileum, c = colon, si = small intestine, - = no data found in the literature. baccording to haila et al.  <cit>  highly expressed in the human colon and low in the human small intestine. caccording to wright et al.  <cit>  specific for human and mouse small intestine.

the regulation of expression in whole intestinal tissues is a good indicator of the combined changes in epithelial crypt and villus cells
in order to assess whether the expression profiles of genes in whole tissue reflect their expression in the epithelium, we determined the expression profile of  <dig> genes in villus and crypt cells using a combined laser micro-dissection and rt-pcr approach. to validate this method we measured a marker for the villi , for crypts in the small intestine, i.e., paneth cells  and crypts in the small intestine and colon .

based on the expression levels of the three crypt/villus markers, rna obtained from laser dissection of the small intestine seems to be highly enriched of region specific material, i.e. villi samples do not contain a notable portion of rna originating from crypt cells .

in order to assess the expression profiles of transporters measured in whole intestinal tissue with microarrays, we verified the mrna levels of nine transporters  measured in the same rna sample preparation by rt-pcr. the expression profiles measured with microarray and rt-pcr had a good concordance. in general, we observed that the profiles measured in the whole tissue in the four segments reflected the average expression in the crypts and the villi.

influence of the crypt-villus axis on the expression of transporters
to test if there is a relationship between the expression profile along the intestine and along the crypt-villus axis, we measured the expression of a subset of transporters in laser-dissected material. we selected transporters which were, based on microarray and rt-pcr results of the whole tissue , not differentially expressed along the intestine , small intestine specific , large intestine specific , either specific for the anterior small intestine  or posterior part of the whole intestine . all nine transporters examined in laser-dissected material tended to conserve their tissue specificity along the intestine . in other words, none of the examined transporters was crypt-specific in one segment and villus-specific in another. abcc <dig> and slc2a <dig> were crypt-specific, whereas slc34a <dig> villus-specific in at least three segments. abcg <dig> and slc28a <dig> showed a villus-specificity in the posterior part of the small intestine, while slc5a <dig> was only in the jejunum villus-specific and slc10a <dig> in the ileum.

aexpression in the four intestinal segments  was measured in whole tissue using microarrays  and rt-pcr  . btissue specificity was determined in laser dissected crypts and villi . "nd" indicates that no significant difference in expression levels were measured between the crypt and villus epithelial cells.

discussion
a crucial step in classifying genes into different molecular functions is the use of a consistent and universal classification system and a precise annotation of affymetrix probe sets. therefore, we included the following features in our analysis: i) mapping of single probes to all transcripts referred to in the unigene database and attributing of annotation tags to each probe set, and ii) assigning of flags to differentially regulated probe sets. similar to chalifa-caspi et al.  <cit> , we have seen that the annotation provided by affymetrix  is not entirely accurate. in the affymetrix annotation a probe set is represented by at most one unigene cluster, while, conducting our own mapping of affymetrix probes onto unigene, we observed that in a number of cases multiple unigene identifiers can be associated to a given probe set.

based on our quality criteria,  <dig> % of all probe sets in the murine genome were found to have a "high" quality annotation on the microarrays used in this study. thus, selecting only "high" quality genes establishes a high degree of confidence regarding the correct annotation of probe sets.

we observed that the genes on the microarrays are not represented by an equal number of probe sets. hence, by counting each probe set as a unit in the go classification system the way it is done by a majority of go classification programs such as mappfinder, ontoexpress and the one provided by netaffx, a bias may be introduced  <cit> . moreover, to our knowledge, none of the programs publicly available provides a confidence assessment regarding the significantly regulated functional classes. therefore, we developed a software, the so-called isrec ontologizer , that takes these factors into account. the use of the flags  provided with the io software permits such an assessment to be made. as indicated in figure  <dig>  a significant portion of the results have a flag "f" and were, therefore, considered ambiguous. some of these "flagged" results, based on unigene identifiers, could be due to the fact that some of the probe sets are associated with the same unigene cluster, but are specific for different splice variants. however, we observed a similar portion of ambiguous results  when doing the classification based on refseq identifiers and concluded that the ambiguity associated with flagged genes may stem from probe design rather than the differential expression of splice variants  <cit> .

some transporters are subject to post-translational modification and of course, one of the processing steps is translocation to the membrane. however, if one considers mrna to be representative of function, then the majority of transporters can be expected to have similar activity along the length of the intestine. in this regard, it is interesting to note that a remarkable fraction of transporters annotated with "carrier activity" are differentially regulated along the a-p axis and could therefore significantly influence the absorption of carrier-mediated bioactive compounds. our go classification results indicate that, in the context of the whole transcriptome, transporters do not seem to be an especially dynamically regulated class, which differs slightly to the conclusions made by bates and colleagues  <cit> . however, a direct comparison is difficult to make, as the classification system used by bates et al. was not in accordance with the official go classification system, and this may underlie the different biological conclusions made between the two studies. furthermore, more importantly, while that study included only  <dig> % of all annotated transporters , this study covers  <dig> % and, provides the first extensive overview of the genomic profiles of transporters in the intestine. similar to their study, the most pronounced difference between adjoining regions was observed for the ileum and the colon. although, in general, the differentially expressed transporters were more highly expressed in the small intestine than in the colon, a surprisingly high number of transporters were identified as being more highly expressed in the colon than in the small intestine  <cit> . many of these transporters have been described as highly expressed in the colon and involved in the bi-directional transport of electrolytes and fluids, which is the principal role of the colon  <cit> . however, the majority of known drug and nutrient transporters or carriers of bioactive compounds  <cit>  are not differently expressed between the small intestine and the colon.

the exploitation of transporters, which are highly expressed in the colon or at similarly high levels as in the small intestine is especially interesting for compounds such as proteins and peptides, which are susceptible to the high enzymatic activity present in the small intestine  <cit> . for example, slc6a <dig>  which transports neutral and amino acids, might be an interesting candidate to be targeted for carrier-mediated absorption. generally, we observed that most of the differentially regulated "carriers" were not specifically over-expressed in any of the three small intestinal segments, but overall more highly expressed in the small intestine versus the colon. thus, the ileum, which contains smaller concentrations of pancreatic enzymes, could be a suitable tissue for compounds that are sensitive to the activity of pancreatic enzymes.

genes classified as having "carrier", "channel", "ion transport" and "electron" and "neurotransmitter" activity are most likely to have different expression levels between the small intestine and colon and may, hence, play a more significant role in the difference of active drug and nutrient transport in these two anatomically distinct regions.

the expression profiles of the most strongly regulated genes  agreed with previous findings in mice . moreover, comparing transporter expression profiles in mice and humans suggests that gut transcriptional profiles obtained in mice are a valid estimator for the situation in humans .

there are several methods that can be used to characterize the patterns of expression of a target gene. traditionally, labeled antisense specific probes have been widely used for in situ hybridization to detect specific gene expression in the intestinal epithelium  <cit> . this technique, however, is very labor-intensive when several candidates are being tested. there are several techniques used to isolate the epithelial layer from the lamina propria of the intestine  <cit> . these methods use mechanical procedures and detergents and/or edta to detach the epithelial layer. separation of crypts from villi epithelium can be achieved following adequate separation procedures. however, alterations of gene expression patterns depending on the procedure as well as cross-contamination from different tissue compartments are possible. similarly, laser dissection microscopy has been developed to isolate single cells  <cit> . a key step in this procedure is the selection of an adequate fixation procedure that prevents rna degradation and preserves tissue histological integrity  <cit> . the protocols used in the present study allows the assessment of a minimally altered gene expression pattern that is concordant with in situ hybridization experiments .

within this context, our data suggest that the changes in expression profiles measured in whole intestinal tissue extracts are a suitable predictor for changes in epithelial cell-only gene expression along the crypts and the villi; however, it should be mentioned that all genes in our comparison were already known to be expressed in the epithelium. this good correlation could reflect the fact that these genes are solely expressed in the epithelium or that the epithelium contributes much more to the isolated rna than underlying layers of intestinal tissues and, therefore dominates the genomic profile of the intestine. thus, for genes which are not solely expressed in the epithelium the prediction based on measurements in whole tissue might not be appropriate.

for some compounds, depending on the enzymatic stability and solubilization characteristics, targeting of carriers in distinct intestinal regions may selectively improve their absorption and bioavailability. thus, we analyzed the expression profiles of known drug carriers along the intestine. the major part of inorganic phosphorus  absorption from the small intestine occurs via a na+-dependent phosphate co-transporter, napi-iib encoded by the gene slc34a <dig>  in vivo pharmacokinetic studies in rats have indicated that foscarnet is transported across the enterocytes by the napi-iib system and thus acts as a competitive inhibitor of pi uptake  <cit> . slc34a <dig> mrna has been shown to be expressed in the small intestine and the colon  <cit> , which is in accordance with our findings. our studies further demonstrate that the expression significantly increases along the a-p axis of the small intestine. as a consequence, the most efficient transport rate is expected to arise in the ileum. in addition to the findings by hilfiker et al.  <cit>  that slc34a <dig> protein is expressed on the apical membrane of mature enterocytes in the duodenum, we observed that slc34a <dig> mrna is villus-specific along the whole intestine except for the duodenum, reinforcing the concept that transporters expressed in the villi epithelium tend to be implicated more in absorptive processes.

slc10a <dig> , the primary carrier for na+-dependent bile salt uptake from the intestinal lumen by the ileum, has been shown to be present in the brush-border membrane of the terminal part of the ileum, but little is known concerning its regulation along the intestine  <cit> . various studies indicate that based on substrate examples asbt could be an important target for increasing the bioavailability of various bile acid conjugates  <cit> . our findings confirm that slc10a <dig> is especially highly expressed in the ileum compared to proximal small intestinal regions; however a comparable level was measured in the colon. interestingly, only in the ileum was slc10a <dig> identified as being villus-specific which could be an indication for its specific role in the ileum.

the four members of the abc families, abcg <dig>  abca <dig>  abcc <dig> and abcc <dig>  that we studied are known to act as secretion pumps in the intestine  <cit> . in accordance with earlier findings, abcc <dig> expression increases from the anterior to posterior part of the intestine  <cit> . on the other hand, our findings for abcc <dig> did not indicate an increase in mrna expression from the crypts to the villi as shown by rost et al.  <cit>  in rats. the mrna levels of abcc <dig> along the crypt-villus axis were in accordance with protein expression  <cit> . generally, all four members may play a significant role along the whole small intestine as secretion pumps, whereas in the large intestine, abcg <dig> is not expected to be involved in the secretion of compounds.

the transporter slc28a <dig> is known to be involved in the transport of nucleoside analogues such as some antiviral compounds  <cit> . nucleosides are relatively hydrophilic molecules and their ability to be transported across cell membranes is a critical determinant of their metabolism  <cit> . our data indicate that similar uptake rates can be expected along the whole intestine when targeting this carrier, as it is similarly expressed in the gut. on the other hand, slc2a <dig>  which was significantly  more highly expressed in the colon, might be an appropriate drug-carrier for compounds sensitive to pancreatic enzymatic degradation. it has to be noted though that the protein product of slc2a <dig>  glut <dig>  is not detectable in healthy human colon tissue, but only in colon cancer serving as a marker for poor prognosis  <cit> . thus, it may be an interesting drug-target/drug carrier in individuals with colon cancers.

in contrast to glut <dig>  slc5a <dig> has been shown to be highly expressed in the colon and to act as a tumor suppressor gene. slc5a <dig> is silenced by methylation in most human colon tumors and reintroduction of this gene leads to growth suppression  <cit> . recent studies have shown that slc5a <dig> acts as a na+-coupled transporter for short chain fatty acids and monocarboxylates. its transport rate is strongly inhibited by various drugs such as ibuprofen. we have shown for the first time that this gene is expressed at similar levels in the distal regions of the gut and seems to be preferentially expressed in the villi of the small intestinal enterocytes. summarizing, this na+-coupled transporter may be involved in the active transport of known monocarboxylate drugs and serve as a valuable drug-carrier for new drugs along the whole intestine.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have characterized the mrna expression profiles of  <dig> % of all currently known transporters along the a-p axis of the gut. we have identified various transporters that could serve as carriers for biologically active compounds. the significant regional specificities are likely to correspond to functional differences along the length of the intestinal tract.

finally, we have presented a comprehensive analysis of regional variations in gene expression using whole gut tissue that is sufficiently sensitive to provide a good assessment of relative changes in regional gene expression in epithelial cells; however, for the functionality of a given transporter to be unequivocally determined, it will be critical to examine these epithelial cells in a cell-type specific manner.
