BACKGROUND
between  <dig> and  <dig> million people are infected with htlv- <dig> worldwide  <cit> . although most subjects are clinically asymptomatic during their lifetime, a proportion  develop adult t cell leukemia/lymphoma  or htlv- <dig> associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis   <cit> . epidemiological surveys have identified regions in the world where prevalence rates are considerably higher, including japan, the caribbean, south america, africa, melanesia and the middle east  <cit> . it has been estimated that the prevalence of htlv- <dig> infection in south america ranges from  <dig> to 5%  <cit> , with an estimated 1– <dig> million infected people in brazil  <cit> . the prevalence in blood donors ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig> % in different areas of the country  <cit> , with a  <dig> % seroprevalence in the city of sao paulo blood donors  <cit> .

htvl- <dig> is a retrovirus encoding the group specific antigen , protease , polymerase , and envelope  genes. six proteins are encoded by the px region of the genome, including the tax protein, which is critical to viral replication and induction of cellular activation and transformation, increasing the expression and production of cytokines and receptors involved in t cell growth and transformation, such as il- <dig>  <cit>  and il- <dig>  <cit> . tax also has the ability of interfering in the expression of several transcription factors and proto-oncogenes, as well as in the nucleic acid repair and apoptosis  <cit> . these effects combined seem to play a key role in the potential of htlv- <dig> to induce cellular transformation and, consequently, trigger the development of atll.

it has been previously demonstrated that htlv- <dig> proviral load is one of the key factors in the pathogenesis of ham/tsp  <cit> , although host genetic factors are also independently associated with the development of the diseases, e.g. certain hla  <cit>  and non-hla  <cit>  genes. these invoke the hypothesis that both viral and genetic host factors are implicated in the pathogenesis of ham/tsp.

the cd8+ t cell response to htlv- <dig> can be readily detected  <cit> , commonly directed against the htlv-1-tax protein. the contribution of the cd8+ t cell response might be particularly important for viral control in htlv- <dig> infection, since infected lymphocytes produce virtually no cell-free infectious htlv- <dig> particles. however, it is noteworthy that the magnitude of the htlv-1-specific t cell response is associated with higher proviral loads, highlighting the fact that t cells frequencies are determined by proviral load, as well as being a determinant of proviral load. cd4+ t cells are the main target for htlv- <dig> infection, which induces cd4+ t cell activation, including proliferation and ifnγ production. the htlv-1-specific cd4+ t cell response is directed mainly against env, the htlv- <dig> envelope surface  <cit> .

treg cells are crucial for the control of autoimmune disease and maintenance of peripheral t cell tolerance . in addition, they can suppress pathogen-specific t cell responses, including response to viruses  <cit> . the mechanisms whereby treg cells suppress t cell responses are not yet fully understood, but are likely to include both soluble factors, e.g. il- <dig> and tgf-β, as well as cell-cell contact dependent mechanisms, e.g. through ctla- <dig>  ctla- <dig>  is expressed by a large fraction of cd4+cd25+ t cells, and by a majority of cd4+cd25high t cells. ctla- <dig> has also been shown to be one of mediators of treg function  <cit> , and is considered a marker for treg cells. in addition, it was recently demonstrated that treg cells are characterized by low levels of the il-7rα   <cit> , which together with cd <dig> help to distinguish treg cells from activated normal cd4+ t cells in healthy individuals. foxp <dig> is a key regulator of treg cell function, but is not exclusive to treg cells; it has been identified in human nonregulatory activated cd4+foxp3+ t cells. humans with mutations in foxp <dig> present with a syndrome characterized by severe autoimmune and inflammatory disorders often early in life, denominated ipex  <cit> . interestingly, it was recently shown that htlv- <dig> tax can downregulate foxp <dig> expression  <cit> .

we hypothesized that htlv- <dig> compromises treg cell function, resulting in higher t cell activation, which contributes to ham/tsp development. we found a significantly higher frequency of cd4+ki-67+ t cells and a lower proportion of ctla-4+ treg cells in subjects with ham/tsp, compared to healthy controls. moreover, we found an inverse correlation between htlv- <dig> proviral load and frequency of cd127low/ctla-4+treg cells. our data suggest a role for treg cells in the pathogenesis of ham/tsp, and reveal a potential new therapeutic target for patients with ham/tsp.

RESULTS
study subjects
blood samples were collected at the federal university of sao paulo outpatient clinics, after informed consent. pbmc were isolated by ficoll-paque plus density gradient centrifugation and cryopreserved. the demographics of the study subjects are shown in table  <dig>  including gender, age, proviral load, cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> absolute t cell counts. no statistically significant differences were observed in gender and age distribution among groups.

cd4+ t cell activation and ifnγ production in healthy donors, htlv- <dig> seropositive asymptomatics, and ham/tsp patients
we initially investigated the expression of ki- <dig>  hla-dr and cd <dig> on cd4+ t cells in pbmc from healthy donors , htlv- <dig> infected patients who were clinically asymptomatic , or had associated neurological disease . ham/tsp had significantly higher frequencies of cd4+ki-67+ t cells compared to htlv or control subjects . in addition, ham/tsp patients had an increase in the frequency of cd4+ hla-dr+ t cells compared to controls , whereas no statistically significant difference in frequency of cd4+cd38+ t cells was noted . furthermore, cd4+ t cells from both htlv and ham/tsp groups had an increase in the spontaneous expression of ifnγ .

decreased frequency of treg cells in ham/tsp patients
in order to assess the frequency of treg cells in htlv- <dig> infected subjects, we measured the expression of cd <dig>  ctla- <dig>  cd <dig> and gitr on cd4+ t cells by flow cytometry. gating strategies are shown in fig. 2a–c. the frequency of cd4+ t cells expressing cd <dig> was very similar between the groups . as cd <dig> is upregulated on activated cd4+ t cells, and thus is not a specific marker for treg cells, we sought to determine the frequency of treg cells using more specific phenotypes. first, we analyzed the frequency of cd4+cd25high t cells, known to be composed mainly of treg cells  <cit> , and no significant difference in the frequency of treg cells could be found between controls and htlv- <dig> subjects . we determined the intracellular expression of ctla- <dig> in cd4+cd25+, and cd4+cd25high t cells and observed a decrease in frequency of ctla-4+ from ham/tsp patients . next, we assessed the expression of cd <dig>  ham/tsp patients had a statistically significant increase in the frequency of cd4+cd25+cd127low t cells compared to controls . in contrast, there was a slight decrease in frequency of cd4+cd25highcd127low t cells in htlv- <dig> infected groups, although this did not reach statistical significance . there were no differences in percent expression of gitr between the groups .

decreased ctla-4+ treg cells correlate with increased cd4+ t cell proliferation in ham/tsp patients
our initial analysis indicated that the frequency of cd4+cd25+cd127low t cells was higher in ham/tsp patients. however, there were a lower percentage of ctla-4+ treg cells, indicating that ham/tsp subjects might have treg cells with a dysfunctional phenotype. moreover, we showed that ham/tsp patients had an increased proliferation and t cell activation, as evidenced by higher frequencies of hla-dr, ki- <dig> and infγ-expressing cd4+ t cells. to test whether the higher frequency of treg cells was associated with lower levels of activation or proliferation of cd4+ t cells, we compared the frequency of ctla-4+, cd127low or gitr+ treg cells with the percentage of cd4+ki-67+ t cells. the frequency of ctla-4+ treg was negatively correlated with the frequency of cd4+ki-67+ t cells in ham/tsp patients only . in addition, there was a negative correlation between the frequency of cd127low treg cells and the percentage of cd4+ki-67+ t cells in controls, whereas no such correlation was found in htlv- <dig> infected subjects . there was no association between gitr+ treg cells with the percentage of cd4+ki-67+ t cells in any group .

the frequency of cd4+cd25+ctla-4+ and cd127low treg cells was negatively correlated to htlv- <dig> proviral load
finally, we wanted to determine whether the frequency of treg cells was related to htlv- <dig> proviral load. high cd4+ t cells activation and elevated htlv- <dig> proviral load are observed in ham/tsp. we hypothesized that this phenomenon would be related to a lower proportion of treg cells. we quantified htlv- <dig> proviral load by real-time pcr and correlated it with the frequency of the different cd25-expressing cd4+ t cell subsets. there was no correlation between the frequency of cd4+cd25+ or cd4+cd25high t cells with proviral load . in contrast, there was a negative correlation between the frequency of cd4+cd25+ctla-4+ t cells and proviral load in htlv only . moreover, there was an inverse correlation between cd127low treg cells and htlv- <dig> proviral load .

discussion
regulatory t cells are important for the maintenance of peripheral t cell tolerance to self antigens, and can also suppress t cell responses to tumors, parasites, viruses and bacteria. in this study we addressed the relationship between treg cells, t cell activation, and htlv- <dig> proviral load. infection with htlv- <dig> was associated with higher spontaneous ifnγ release by cd4+ t cells, but only in ham/tsp there was a marked increase in t cell proliferation.

the htlv- <dig> derived tax protein can downregulate expression of the foxp <dig>  which presence is associated with treg cell function  <cit> . increased expression of tax can be expected in patients with ham/tsp, who have higher proviral loads compared to asymptomatic carries. we observed a higher proportion of cd4+ ifnγ+ t cells in htlv- <dig> infected subjects, which could also be indicative of a decreased treg cell fraction. interestingly, only the ham/tsp patients presented with a higher cell proliferation, as measured by ki- <dig> staining, which correlated markedly with htlv- <dig> proviral load . these observations suggest that htlv- <dig> directly affects treg cell number, and as proviral load increases, not only is the control of ifnγ lost, but controls on cell proliferation as well. our data, together with the recent findings that htlv- <dig> tax downregulates foxp <dig> expression, indicate that treg cell dysfunction can be a direct consequence of htlv- <dig> infection.

in order to better understand the role of treg cells in htlv-i infection and disease, we used ctla- <dig> and cd <dig> staining in cd4+cd25high cells as markers for treg subsets. cd <dig> and ctla- <dig> have been described as useful markers for treg, and facilitate the identification of treg cells, even without staining for foxp <dig>  <cit> . in this study, we found that an increased frequency of cd127lowcd4+cd25+ treg in controls correlated negatively with cd4+ t cell proliferation , indicating that these cells indeed have a regulatory immunophenotype. in contrast, increased frequency of these cells correlated with increased cd4+ t cell proliferation in htlv- <dig> infected individuals, suggesting that these cells are not regulatory t cells in these individuals. in addiction, the elevated frequency of ctla-4+ treg cells was negatively correlated to cd4+ t cell proliferation only in ham/tsp patients, which suggest that it is a better immunophenotype of treg cells in ham/tsp patients, but more studies are necessary to confirm this.

we could detect a negative association between the frequency of ctla-4+ or cd127low treg cells and proviral load, extending recent findings of an association between foxp <dig> expression and htlv- <dig> infection  <cit> . we speculate that therapeutic manipulation of regulatory t cells could positively impact disease pathogenesis. two mechanisms might be involved, the first by suppressing the exuberant anti-htlv- <dig> cd8+ t cell mediated immune response, and the second by suppression of cd4+ t cell proliferation, which can result in lower proviral load. however, stimulating an expansion of treg cells could also provide additional targets for htlv- <dig> replication, so such studies should proceed with great caution.

in this study, there are some limitations. the study was cross sectional, and with a limited number of patients in each group. we hope that future longitudinal studies can assess changes in treg cells over time in htlv- <dig> infected patients. we, and others, working in the regulatory t cells field, are limited by the lack of definitive phenotypic markers of treg, and cd4+cd25+/high remains the standard identifiers. in this study we have added other markers, but at the time the study was conducted, the foxp <dig> antibody, commonly used to detect a treg cell population was not commercially available. however, this may have been a fortuitous event, as recent reports suggest that foxp <dig> is also expressed on non regulatory t cells in humans  <cit> . as we did not have access to tissue samples from these subjects, we cannot exclude redistribution of cells out of the peripheral blood into tissues, and the study of regulatory t cells at secondary lymphoid sites and within csf will be of interest for a future study of htlv- <dig> associated disease.

in conclusion, our data suggest a role of treg cells in the pathogenesis of ham/tsp. further studies should help delineate the ability of expanded treg cells to affect t cell proliferation in htlv- <dig> patients and the potential development of therapeutic modulation of regulatory t cells in htlv- <dig> patients.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we showed that htlv-i drives activation, spontaneous ifnγ production, and proliferation of cd4+ t cells. ham/tsp patients have a decreased frequency of treg cells in peripheral blood, compared to healthy subjects, markedly in the cd4+cd25highctla+ phenotype. the proportion of cd127low treg cells correlated inversely with htlv- <dig> proviral load. these results suggest that treg cells may be subverted in ham/tsp patients, and contributes to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for patients with htlv-1-related disease.
