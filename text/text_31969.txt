BACKGROUND
proliferative cells are made competent for dna replication and mitosis at the g1/s and g2/m boundaries. in arabidopsis, at g2/m, proliferative cells are regulated by arath;cdka; <dig>  and by b-type cdks, one of which, cdkb1; <dig>  has a single peak of activity at g2/m  <cit> . in fission yeast, at the g2/m transition, mik1/wee <dig> kinases act redundantly to phosphorylate tyr <dig> of the cdk thereby inactivating the latter  <cit> . conversely cdc <dig> dephosphorylates the same residue enabling cdk activity  <cit> . although homologues for the fission yeast wee <dig> have been identified in several plant species  <cit> , a full length homologue of cdc <dig> has only been found in algae  <cit>  while higher plant genomes have a partial cdc <dig> gene that lacks the regulatory domain  <cit> . although arath;cdc <dig>  encodes a protein capable of phosphatase activity in vitro  <cit> , it induces a short cell length in fission yeast  <cit>  and has a subtle effect on root growth  <cit> , its encoded protein can exhibit arsenate reductase activity  <cit> . thus currently, there is insufficient functional evidence to tag arath;cdc <dig> as a bona fide cdc <dig> cell cycle gene. however, in nicotiana plumbaginifolia cell cultures a cdc25-like phosphatase activity was detected at the g2/m transition  <cit>  although the identity of the gene involved remains unknown.

in the absence of a clear plant cdc <dig> homologue, schizosaccharomyces pombe spcdc <dig> expression in plant cells has been useful as a tool to investigate the effects of dephosphorylation of the cdks on cell division and plant development. spcdc <dig> has clear effects on development and on the cell cycle when expressed in tobacco. in n. plumbaginifolia it dephosphorylated native cdk and induced cells to enter mitosis  <cit> . it also induced a small cell size in tobacco plants  <cit> , in tobacco root cultures  <cit>  and in tobacco by- <dig> cells  <cit> . in by- <dig> cells, the smaller mitotic cell size induced by spcdc <dig> expression was linked to cdkb but not cdka activity, and a short g <dig> phase  <cit> . furthermore, in cultured primary roots of tobacco, induced spcdc <dig> expression caused an increase in the frequency of smaller lateral root primordia, and smaller roots comprising smaller mitotic cells compared with un-induced roots  <cit> .

expression of spcdc <dig> in tobacco cell cultures suggested a link to cytokinin signalling. in plants, cytokinins are required for the g2/m transition  <cit>  and treating tobacco by- <dig> cells with lovastatin, an inhibitor of cytokinin biosynthesis, not only suppressed a peak of cytokinin synthesis but also blocked the g2/m transition  <cit> . however expression of spcdc <dig> in tobacco by- <dig> cells could over-ride this requirement  <cit>  suggesting that the additional phosphatase activity was replacing the cytokinin signal. furthermore, all moieties of cytokinin were barely above detectable levels in spcdc <dig> expressing cells  <cit> . in tobacco plants expressing spcdc <dig>  induction of both vegetative and floral shoot morphogenesis from callus suggests that the spcdc <dig> expression was mimicking an altered balance of plant growth regulators towards cytokinins; spcdc <dig> could replace exogenous cytokinin to induce shoots in culture  <cit> . however, to date, evidence of alterations to endogenous cytokinins that could strengthen the cell cycle link of spcdc <dig> to developmental changes is lacking in whole plants.

a two-hybrid screen revealed that spcdc <dig> interacts with numerous arabidopsis proteins including 14-3- <dig> proteins  <cit> , however to date there is no information on changes in endogenous gene expression as a result of the expression of spcdc <dig> in plants. a major aim of the work presented here was to test the relationship between spcdc <dig> expression and endogenous cytokinins and to analyse global gene expression in arabidopsis plants expressing spcdc <dig>  in which we have also made a detailed phenotypic analysis.

results presented here extend substantially our previous work in showing that ectopic expression of the mitotic inducer, spcdc <dig>  results in profound changes to root morphology, meristem architecture and the regulation of the plane of cell division. we further show that in planta spcdc <dig> expression  depletes endogenous levels of the cytokinin, ipa,  down regulates the cytokinin receptor, ahk <dig>   results in over production of auxin and ethylene,  up-regulates ethylene biosynthetic genes and  induces hypersensitive hypocotyl growth responses to ethylene. hence perturbation of genes associated with cytokinin and ethylene signalling explain the phenotypes upon expression of this fission yeast mitotic inducer gene. this indicates an important cross-talk between cell cycle regulation at g2/m transition, plant growth regulators and plant morphogenesis.

RESULTS
expression of spcdc <dig> increases the frequency of lateral roots and adventitious roots but not primary root elongation in arabidopsis seedlings
given the root developmental changes induced by spcdc <dig> in tobacco, we tested whether spcdc <dig> could similarly affect arabidopsis. two independent transgenic lines expressing the btx:: spcdc <dig> construct, verified by rt-pcr , showed a significant increase in the number of lateral roots and lateral root primordia per unit length of primary root, compared with wt in  <dig> d old seedlings but no difference in primary root length. . hence, the rate of lateral root production per mm of primary root was substantially higher  in the spcdc <dig> lines compared with wt .

we also tested whether expression of spcdc <dig> affected the formation of adventitious roots from cultured hypocotyls derived from intact  <dig> d old plants and found that spcdc <dig> explants produced significantly more than wt .

expression of spcdc <dig> decreases root meristem width through narrowing of cortical and stelar cell width
a hall-mark feature of spcdc <dig> expression in tobacco plants is a small cell size phenotype and we examined whether this was also so in arabidopsis. we extended this analysis in arabidopsis to examine ram architecture in relation to the similar rate of primary root elongation of spcdc <dig> compared with wt. spcdc <dig> expression affected neither cell length nor cell width for epidermal lineages of the ram. indeed, spcdc <dig> expression also had little effect on cell length in either the cortex or stele . however, there was a highly significant decrease in cell width for cells of the cortex and stele in spcdc <dig> compared with wt . given little change in cell length between genotypes, the transition point was at comparable distances from the root tip for each tissue . however, consistent with the narrowing of cell width in the cortex and stele, the overall girth of the ram was narrower  in spcdc <dig>  compared with wt  .

at the cellular level, the data suggest that in the cortex and stele, spcdc <dig> expression reduces the span of periclinal divisions that in turn would create narrower cell lineages. we tested this hypothesis using confocal microscopy. here we show that spcdc <dig> expression does indeed result in narrower "körper clusters" compared with wild type . the net result is a narrower ram and a narrower primary root system compared with wt. however, clearly, spcdc <dig> expression has no effect on anticlinal divisions in the epidermis. the null effect of spcdc <dig> on meristematic cell length is consistent with no significant difference in meristem length between genotypes  and similar rates of primary root elongation between genotypes . consistent with this is that in cortical tissue adjacent to young lateral root primordia, mean cortical cell lengths of  <dig> ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm for wt and spcdc <dig>  respectively were not significantly different .

expression of spcdc <dig> increases rooting from cultured hypocotyls
in tobacco cell cultures expression of spcdc <dig> enables cells to bypass a requirement for cytokinins at the g2/m transition; indeed in this line cytokinin levels were depleted  <cit> . the strong lateral root phenotype in vivo also suggested that auxin levels might be involved in the plant's response to spcdc <dig> expression. to explore further this cross-talk between plant growth regulators and the cell cycle, we tested whether application of exogenous cytokinin and auxin might affect rooting in cultured hypocotyls.

in initial experiments we used the grid system of inoue et al.  <cit>  comprising exposure of explanted hypocotyls to combinations of naphthyl acetic acid  and kinetin  ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> ng ml- <dig> . from here on we refer to these treatments as naa/kin, each prefixed by the appropriate concentration .

at higher levels of naa/kin  callus and root/shoot formation appeared similar in spcdc <dig> and wt, however at  <dig> naa, root/shoot formation appeared enhanced in wt compared with spcdc <dig>  conversely at ≤  <dig> naa, root formation appeared enhanced in spcdc <dig> compared with wt . hence, there was the suggestion, that below an auxin threshold , hypocotyls from spcdc <dig> plants explanted to culture media have increased competence for root formation.

to verify these indicative results we undertook a more rigorous quantitative analysis of this trend by employing four specific naa/kin combinations in which we established  <dig> hypocotyls per treatment . we chose 25naa/25kin and 300naa/300kin, the minimum and maximum concentrations used in the grids. we further chose 50naa/200kin as a combination that induced a stronger rooting response in spcdc <dig> compared with wt in the original grids and the converse, 200naa/50kin. at all of the naa/kin combinations tested except the highest, there were significantly more roots produced by the transgenic line expressing spcdc <dig> compared to wt  whereas shoot production was significantly higher only at the two lower auxin concentrations . callus formation was only significantly greater in the spcdc <dig> expressing line at the lowest auxin and cytokinin concentrations tested .

expression of spcdc <dig> in arabidopsis affects expression of  <dig> genes including genes related to ethylene signalling
to understand more fully how the expression of spcdc <dig> caused clear phenotypic changes in arabidopsis roots we examined the extent to which the expression of this gene caused alterations in global gene expression occurring in the transformed seedlings. microarray analysis of arabidopsis seedling roots expressing spcdc <dig> compared to wt revealed that  <dig> genes were up-regulated > 2-fold and  <dig> were down-regulated by > 2-fold when analysed using genespring software . expression of selected genes was confirmed by real time rt-pcr, .

of particular interest were  <dig> differentially expressed genes related to signalling, transcription and plant growth regulators ,  <dig> of which were up-regulated while  <dig> were down regulated in the spcdc <dig> line. three of the differentially expressed genes are related to ethylene signalling. the first , which is a member of a subfamily b- <dig> of the ethylene responsive erf/ap <dig> transcription factors, is up-regulated in spcdc <dig> seedlings by  <dig> -fold. the other two genes are down regulated by  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold respectively: at2g <dig>  which is a member of the ein <dig> family, positive regulators of ethylene responses and at2g <dig>  known as ebf <dig>  an f-box protein involved in the ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent proteolysis of ein <dig>  and is thus a negative regulator of ethylene signalling  <cit> . in addition acc oxidase  expression was up-regulated on the microarrays by  <dig> -fold.

spcdc <dig> expression results in changes linked to ethylene metabolism and signalling
the microarray results provided novel information about genes associated with ethylene metabolism in the spcdc <dig> plants. expression levels of the ethylene related genes erf2/ap <dig> family member , acc oxidase  and ebf <dig>  were therefore verified using real time rt-pcr. expression of both erf2/ap <dig> and acc oxidase were up-regulated by at least  <dig> -fold in agreement with the array data. the down-regulation of ebf <dig> on the array, however was not confirmed . these data are consistent with increased ethylene production and signalling in spcdc <dig> plants.

given the development of isodiametric cells in the cortex and stele of rams in spcdc <dig> expressing plants, which is a typical ethylene induced response  <cit> , we tested for further evidence of ethylene-related phenotypes in the spcdc <dig> plants. hypocotyl length was highly significantly reduced  in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> day old seedlings of spcdc <dig> plants compared with wt grown in continuous darkness . this differential effect was nullified when the seedlings were grown in a  <dig> h l/ <dig> h d regime. exposing these genotypes to exogenous ethylene also resulted in a differential magnitude of hypocotyl shortening. in wt, hypocotyl length was not significantly different in the  <dig> and  <dig> ppm ethylene treatments but there was a highly significant difference at  <dig> compared with  <dig> ppm . in contrast, in spcdc <dig> hypocotyl length was significantly shorter in the  <dig> ppm treatment compared with  <dig> ppm but there was no additional shortening at  <dig> ppm although compared with  <dig> ppm, hypocotyl length was significantly shorter . these data suggest a hypersensitive response of hypocotyls of spcdc <dig> plants compared with wt when exposed to  <dig> ppm ethylene. moreover, spcdc <dig> plants produced 2-fold more ethylene than wt .

spcdc <dig> expression in arabidopsis perturbs the expression of a cytokinin receptor gene and perturbs endogenous cytokinin and iaa levels
notable in the microarrays, was the down-regulation of ahk <dig> in spcdc <dig> plants by  <dig> -fold; this gene encodes a putative cytokinin receptor. this result was confirmed by real-time rt-pcr . we then tested whether endogenous cytokinin levels mirrored ahk <dig> expression, in roots of spcdc <dig> and wt. data presented in figure 5e for roots of spcdc <dig> plants compared to wt show a  <dig> -fold increase in zeatin riboside  concentration, zeatin  was unaltered whereas isopentenyladenosine  was reduced by almost 2-fold . hence, the cytokinin depletion effect we had observed in tobacco cells in culture was matched regarding ipa in root systems of arabidopsis. these changes in cytokinins may help to explain the enhanced lateral root phenotype in spcdc <dig> plants. additionally, we detected a substantial  increase in free iaa in spcdc <dig> roots , again consistent with the enhanced root branching response.

discussion
spcdc <dig> expression promotes lateral and adventitious root production
in tobacco plants, expression of spcdc <dig> resulted in a decrease in mitotic cell size and an increase in lateral root production  <cit> . results here confirm this effect in arabidopsis but show that whilst primary root elongation is not promoted by spcdc <dig> expression, lateral and adventitious root production most certainly is.

although in vivo responses are not always mirrored in vitro we further showed this strong rooting phenotype in vitro through culture of hypocotyls in two way combinations of auxin and cytokinin. noticeably, at the lower end of the auxin concentration range  but seemingly regardless of exogenous kinetin levels, explanted hypocotyls from spcdc <dig> plants were more adept at making roots in vitro. thus hypocotyls showed greater competence for rooting in vivo and in vitro confirming cross talk between this mitotic inducer gene and development. indeed, we propose that the increased frequency of lateral roots is a cell cycle effect in the pericycle, based on published evidence that spcdc <dig> dephosphorylates native plant cdk  <cit>  and induces both premature cdkb activity and premature mitosis  <cit> .

spcdc <dig> expression depletes ipa and raises iaa
one way in which lateral root production can be enhanced is by cytokinin depletion through over-expression of cytokinin oxidase  <cit> . spcdc <dig> expression also depletes cytokinin levels in cultured by- <dig> cells  <cit>  and led us to hypothesise that a similar spcdc25-induced reduction in cytokinin levels in arabidopsis roots might explain the root phenotypes we observe. cytokinin levels in these plants partly support this hypothesis in that ipa is significantly depleted but neither zeatin nor zeatin riboside are reduced. however, in plants expressing spcdc <dig>  the cytokinin receptor gene, ahk <dig> showed reduced expression. note that there is not a universal positive relationship between cytokinin depletion and root branching. for example, arabidopsis ahk <dig> ahk <dig> double mutants had increased zeatin and zeatin riboside levels, in combination with decreased ipa but increased primary root growth as well as more lateral roots  <cit> . thus the data presented here, showing a reduction in ahk <dig> expression with a depletion of ipa level in combination with an increase in trans-zeatin riboside is also consistent with an increase in lateral root production in the spcdc <dig> expressing plants. riefler et al.,  <cit>  argue for a feedback mechanism between receptor levels and cytokinin biosynthesis. an increase in mitotic entry by spcdc <dig> expression might be feeding back both to cytokinin levels and also to receptor levels with more emphasis on depletion of ipa than other cytokinin moieties.

the steady state level of endogenous cytokinins in plant tissues is a reflection of cytokinin biosynthesis, degradation and transport. nucleoside-type cytokinins have been proposed as the major transport form  <cit> ; ip ribosides and ribotides are transported basipetally together with sucrose via the phloem whereas tzr is transported acropetally via the transpiration stream in the xylem. moreover, different import carriers are involved in cell-cell transport of free bases and cytokinin nucleosides . the observed reduction in ipa, might indicate an impaired phloem derived transport of ipa towards the roots upon expression of spcdc <dig>  hence, our current data highlight subtle cross talk between spcdc <dig> expression and cytokinin supply.

lateral root primordia start in pericycle cells opposite protoxylem poles. when secondary root founder cells are activated, cycling is started again in cells previously held in g <dig>  <cit> . this is under control of a complex interplay of auxin and cytokinins at the level of biosynthesis and transport. spcdc <dig> replaces the normal cytokinin requirement in the cdk dephosphorylation during g2-m resulting in an active cdk in order to unblock the substrate and atp-binding sites  <cit> . notably, in animal cells, cytokinins act as a competitive inhibitor for atp binding on cdc <dig> , cdk <dig>  and cdk <dig> . although cdk <dig> has no orthologue in planta, it is clear that ip is an exclusive cytokinin in the control of the g1/s transition in animal cells  <cit> . hence, the reduction in ipa concentration in the root reported here may be important in cell cycle control in clusters of pericyle cells that serve as secondary root founders.

another strong feature of enhanced root branching in arabidopsis is positive regulation by iaa as demonstrated through both genetic and physiological manipulations  <cit> . thus, the greater the amount of iaa relative to cytokinins in primary roots, the greater the frequency of lateral roots. notably, we also detected an increased amount of iaa in roots of spcdc <dig> compared with wt, which again is consistent with the strong rooting phenotype reported here.

spcdc <dig> expression alters root architecture
spcdc <dig> had a null effect on primary root elongation yet its expression altered the architecture of the meristem and the overall width of the root. notably, cells in the cortex and stele were smaller but more isodiametric in spcdc <dig> compared with wild type, caused by a reduction in cell width but not cell length. körper type "⊥" divisions occur in apical initials of rams whereby a periclinal division creates two files of cells that then form lineages as a result of repeated transverse divisions  <cit> . hence, the periclinal division of apical initials has a profound effect on the overall width of the ram. here we hypothesise that premature entry into mitosis, activated by spcdc <dig> expression, restricts the width of these periclinal divisions in both cortex and stele with the net result being a narrower ram and a narrower primary root system compared with wt. spcdc <dig> can indeed alter the plane of cell divisions to induce isodiametric growth of by- <dig> cells and other tobacco lines in culture  <cit> . note that in cultured tobacco cells, transverse divisions are the norm and that isodiametric cells come about through an increased frequency of longitudinal  divisions. this type of effect is also suggested to result in an increased frequency of periclinal divisions in the pericycle producing the strong lateral root phenotype in both tobacco  <cit>  and here in arabidopsis.

spcdc <dig> expression perturbs ethylene signalling
an induction of isodiametric cell growth is a classic ethylene response  <cit>  and the hypersensitive hypocotyl shortening response reported here either in the presence or absence of exogenous ethylene and its overproduction in spcdc <dig> plants all point to an ethylene effect at the cellular level. to our knowledge, an ethylene induced isodiametric cell phenotype in rams has not been overtly reported in the published literature although in a study of ethylene effects on the quiescent centre of arabidopsis, images of wt rams treated with acc were narrower than untreated controls . nevertheless, the up-regulation of ethylene associated genes, hypocotyl length suppression in darkness see also,  <cit>  and isodiametric ram cellular phenotype tend to suggest that changes in ethylene synthesis or signalling in spcdc <dig> plants are regulating these effects. previous work established that exogenous ethylene has no substantial effect on rates of cell division in rams of either pea or corn  <cit>  nor did we detect any difference in primary root elongation rates in spcdc <dig> compared with wt. however, in arabidopsis ethylene does modulate cell division in the quiescent centre  <cit>  and through interactions with auxin assists in the regulation of root cap size  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of the mitotic inducer gene, spcdc <dig> in arabidopsis has several important but explainable consequences. at a developmental level, spcdc <dig> expression depletes ipa levels, down regulates ahk <dig> expression but raises iaa levels and promotes lateral root production. this alteration in the endogenous auxin-cyokinin milieu is entirely consistent with the stimulation of lateral roots. at a cellular level, spcdc <dig> perturbs ethylene signalling, induces the plants to over produce ethylene that in turn probably alters planes of cell division that lead to isodiametric cell growth in rams. we have shown previously that spcdc <dig> expression causes premature mitosis at a reduced cell size through shortening of the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle and bypasses a requirement for cytokinins at the g2/m transition  <cit> . hence our data are important in highlighting cross talk between cell cycle control, hormonal signalling and development .
