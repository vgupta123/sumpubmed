BACKGROUND
horizontal gene transfer , also called lateral gene transfer, is known to occur among prokaryotic organisms, and is considered an important force in their evolution  <cit> , but hgt is less well known among eukaryotes  <cit> . based on a study of known protein domain families and publicly available sequences, there is evidence for hgt among more than 50% of archaea, between 30% to 50% of bacteria, and less than 10% of eukaryotes  <cit> .

the role of hgt in the evolution of fungi was recently reviewed  <cit> , and the authors speculated that the mode of feeding and large surface area in association with other organisms allow fungi a greater opportunity for hgt than other eukaryotes. among fungi, some species have been found to contain sequences resembling those of bacterial genes, but such sequences were absent in other fungal species, and this was interpreted as hgt  <cit> . transfer of a supernumerary chromosome between vegetatively incompatible biotypes of the phytopathogenic fungus, colletotrichum gloeosporioides, was obtained under laboratory conditions  <cit> . gene clusters encoding for epipolythiodioxopiperazines, which are a class of secondary metabolite toxins, have been found in various ascomycete fungi, but the phylogeny of these gene clusters was not concordant with that of the organisms in which they were found.  <cit> . a nitrate assimilation gene cluster was thought to have been transferred first from oomycota to dikarya , and then more recently from a basdiomycete to the ascomycete trichoderma reesei, which allowed this fungus to better exploit its new niche  <cit> .

in a review of the evolution of virulence genes in fungi  <cit> , the authors speculate that hgt is important in their origin in different pathogenic species, and may facilitate the emergence of new pathogens. they also noted the phenomenon where virulence genes are present in clusters. for example, a cluster of genes similar to those in pea was found on a supernumerary chromosome of three different fungi pathogenic to pea  <cit> . the authors of the review also speculate that the high density of transposable and repetitive elements frequently observed near putative virulence genes somehow allows or even facilitates the clustering of virulence genes, and that regions characterised by particular sequences may be more susceptible to hgt.

one group of genes that has not been demonstrated to be subjected to hgt encodes for ribosomal rna  <cit> . these genes are found in the ribosomal dna  region, and form what has been called the ribosomal cassette. the rrna combine with protein molecules to form ribosomes that function in protein synthesis. because of the high demand for protein synthesis, there are multiple copies repeated tens to thousands of times in a genome  <cit> . eukaryotes have rdna cassettes formed by the small subunit , the internally transcribed spacer   <dig>  the  <dig> s gene, the its <dig>  the large subunit  and the intergenic spacer region. the differences between rdna sequences allow for studies of phylogenetic relationships over a wide range of taxonomic levels  <cit> .

in the current study, we found that dna of a field fungal strain from rice , was amplified with two sets of specific, normally diagnostic rdna primers: one set for the sheath blight fungus, and the other for the sheath blot fungus. sheath blight, caused by thanatephorus cucumeris, is a notorious disease of rice with serious losses every year  <cit> . ceratobasidium oryzae-sativae is another pathogen of rice, which causes sheath blot. these two pathogens both have their anamorphs  in the fungal form-genus rhizoctonia, but are considered distantly related. further testing with the fungal strain from the field using species-specific primers, southern hybridization, dna cloning, and dna sequencing yielded results implying that gene transfer had occurred between rdna genes of these two species of pathogenic fungi, and that genetic recombination had occurred at the  <dig> s gene.

RESULTS
in november  <dig>  a fungal strain, named rcol- <dig>  was isolated from a typical rice sheath blight lesion in a field at huazhong agricultural university in central china. the growth rate of rcol- <dig> was slower than the average for either of the two major fungal rice pathogens thanatephorus cucumeris or ceratobasidium oryzae-sativae. this isolate also showed abnormal colony formation on pda , with sclerotia irregularly distributed compared to the two rice pathogens . rcol- <dig> was also found to be avirulent when inoculated onto plant host tissue. dapi staining  showed that the distribution of nuclei in individual cells of rcol- <dig> was not uniform , with some cells containing only one nucleus , some with two nuclei , and some multinucleate  with up to  <dig> nuclei observed per cell. in contrast, cells of t. cucumeris consistently contain multiple nuclei, and c. oryzae-sativae has two nuclei in each cell  <cit> .

dna of rcol- <dig> was tested using primers specific for either t. cucumeris or c. oryzae-sativae  <cit>  based on the internal transcribed spacer  of the multi-copy nuclear ribosomal dna genes . rcol- <dig> was found to have target bands of both fungal species . furthermore, southern blot of genomic dna showed that the dna of rcol- <dig> could hybridize with either of the two probes, but the dna of isolate wh- <dig>  or wh- <dig>  would only hybridize with their respective probes . these results confirmed that rcol- <dig> contained rdna sequence from both c. oryzae-sativae and t. cucumeris.

in addition to primer gmrs- <dig> which was based on the its <dig> sequence of t. cucumeris  <cit> , three other primers were used which were designed from the its <dig> sequence of t. cucumeris , or the its <dig>  or its <dig>  of c. oryzae-sativae. the two forward and two reverse primers were used in all combinations. the amplification products  were sequenced, and these showed that rcol- <dig> contained four types of its sequences, ones fully matching either c. oryzae-sativae  or t. cucumeris , and two types of chimeric sequences: its <dig> dna from c. oryzae-sativae with its <dig> dna from t. cucumeris  or its <dig> dna from t. cucumeris with its <dig> dna from c. oryzae-sativae . the  <dig> bp alignment of the its of c. oryzae-sativae  with t. cucumeris  showed  <dig> % identity, further demonstrating that these are distinct species, although they both have their anamorphs in the form-genus rhizoctonia.

clones were generated from polymerase chain reaction  products derived using universal fungal primers, its <dig> and its <dig>  <cit> , and these clones were tested with the four pairs of primers mentioned above. among the  <dig> clones,  <dig> were found to contain a complete its cassette of c. oryzae-sativae, but one of the clones was chimeric, with its <dig> of c. oryzae-sativae and its <dig> of t. cucumeris, based on primer amplification and dna sequencing. to specifically detect the presence of t. cucumeris dna, genomic dna of rcol- <dig> was amplified with the primer pair its <dig>  and gmrs- <dig> . the pcr product was used to generate  <dig> clones which were tested with the primer pairs coits-f and gmrs- <dig> , and p-rsits1-f and gmrs- <dig> , giving  <dig> and  <dig> clones, respectively. similarly, dna of rcol- <dig> was amplified with the primer pair rsits <dig>  and its <dig> . clones were obtained, and  <dig> were tested with the primer pairs p-rsits1-f and p-coits2-r , and p-rsits1-f and gmrs- <dig> , giving  <dig> and  <dig> clones, respectively. the ratio of chimeric clones to pure t. cucumeris clones in each test was between  <dig> to  <dig>  implying that there are more copies of the chimeras than complete t. cucumeris its sequences. the greater abundance of chimeric sequences than pure t. cucumeris its sequences may be a result of crossing over events at the conserved  <dig> s gene, which sits between its <dig> and its <dig> 

hyphae of t. cucumeris and c. oryzae-sativae are vegetatively incompatible, and do not successfully anastomose. however, they parasitize the same host, and perhaps under the influence of host enzymes targeted to weaken pathogen cells or in dying host plant tissue, the fungal hyphae lost their integrity, and normal vegetative incompatibility mechanisms were overcome, allowing the hyphae to fuse. this direct intimate contact within the host could theoretically have lead to a transfer of genomic dna between the fungi. unlike plants and animals, vegetative cells of fungi are less differentiated, and each cell has the ability to develop into a new mycelium. this means that if any fungal cell were to obtain foreign dna that was compatible with the dna replication system, the cell could theoretically propagate the foreign dna to daughter mycelia.

hgt was thought to be limited to the early stages of diverging lineages  <cit> , although a review of more recent literature  <cit>  has found frequent hgt in some phagotrophic algae and hgt between plant lineages, with few examples for animals or fungi. the hgt event between c. oryzae-sativa and t. cucumeris which generated rcol- <dig> was probably a relatively recent one, since such an abnormal isolate may be less fit and not have a high survival rate in nature. in july  <dig>  eight months after the initial isolation of rcol- <dig>  more intensive sampling was conducted in the field where rcol- <dig> was originally collected, and three other strains with morphology similar to rcol- <dig> were found, although not at the original site of collection. this suggests that isolates such as rcol- <dig> might be able to persist, even though macroscopically avirulent in pathogenicity tests, and with less aggressive growth than either parental type. another explanation is that the intergeneric hybridization events occurred more than once in this field, and are more frequent than currently thought.

CONCLUSIONS
we hypothesize that a presumably rare anastomosis event between hyphae of t. cucumeris and c. oryzae-sativae allowed the transfer of nuclei into a c. oryzae-sativae mycelium, followed by nuclear fusion and crossing over events. the relative scarcity of t. cucumeris its sequences compared to c. oryzae-sativae, could be a result of the transfer of just a few nuclei from t. cucumeris into an extensive c. oryzae-sativae mycelium, or the subsequent process of concerted evolution  to homogenize the ribosomal gene sequences. species of rhizoctonia are known to be multinucleate, but the presence of chimeric forms of the its in rcol- <dig> indicates that dna of the two parental species had been mixed, rather than existing solely in separate nuclei. furthermore, the growth debilitation and avirulence found with rcol- <dig> are not likely to have resulted just from the altered ribosomal gene cassettes, since there are mostly pure copies of c. oryzae-sativae in rcol- <dig>  which should be sufficient for full function. there are probably other genes in rcol- <dig> that have been affected by the intergeneric hybridization, giving the debilitated phenotype. further research remains to reveal which other genes may have been affected, but the results of the current study indicate that horizontal gene transfer can occur between different genera of fungi, and based on the presence of other similarly debilitated field isolates, we speculate that such occurrences may not be so rare.
