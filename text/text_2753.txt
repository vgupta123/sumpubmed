BACKGROUND
cell and tissue homeostasis are among the most important features of living organisms. in vertebrates, various types of extracellular molecules act as cell growth regulators. for example, angiostatin and endostatin are potent inhibitors of endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis  <cit> . they contribute to our understanding of in vivo cell growth homeostasis and therapeutic control of tumor angiogenesis  <cit> . among invertebrates, many species have multipotent cells that undergo cell growth and differentiation during regeneration and budding  <cit> . therefore, many unique and interesting homeostatic factors are expected to exist in invertebrates. however, our understanding of such factors and global mechanisms remains very poor.

polyandrocarpa misakiensis is a budding tunicate. buds arise as outgrowths of the parent body wall . soon after detached from the parent, a bud begins morphogenesis restricted to the proximal area , and in about a week, it becomes a miniature of adult zooid . tc14- <dig> is a 14-kda ca2+-dependent, galactose-binding tunicate protein that is widely expressed in the coelomic space of bud   <cit> . interestingly, tc14- <dig> disappears from the in vivo morphogenetic, proximal area of bud immediately before cell growth and differentiation begin   <cit> . tc14- <dig> is one of several different but closely related polypeptides isolated from p. misakiensis   <cit> . all tc14s belong to the c-type lectin family, which is characterized by a specific carbohydrate recognition domain   <cit> . tc14- <dig> induces epithelial transformation of undifferentiated coelomic cells during budding in p. misakiensis  <cit> . tc14- <dig> can form a heterodimer together with tc14- <dig>  although other biochemical features and biological functions are unknown  <cit> . tc14- <dig> exhibits cytostatic activities that regulate in vitro cell proliferation, cell adhesion, and cell differentiation of multipotent epithelial cells  <cit> . we wondered why only tc14- <dig> but not tc14- <dig> possesses these activities.

the polycomb group  genes are involved in epigenetic control of genomic activity. pcgs in drosophila were initially identified as homeotic gene repressors  <cit> . pcg proteins bind in vivo to many discrete sites on the chromosome  <cit> . in mammals, pcg homologs play a role in genome-wide gene silencing  <cit> . they are essential for cell fate maintenance in embryonic stem cells  <cit>  and hematopoietic stem cells  <cit> . in keratinocytes, pcg proteins regulate cell growth, differentiation, and senescence  <cit> . polycomb repressive complex  <dig> , a biochemically discernible component of pcg, is involved in gene repression by histone modification  <cit> . prc <dig> contains several core proteins: histone h <dig> methyltransferase  catalyzes trimethylation of h <dig> at lys <dig> ; eed and suz <dig> are ezh <dig> activators  <cit> . we found recently that a polyandrocarpa homolog of eed  was remarkably induced during budding, an expression pattern similar to that of the tc14s  <cit> . it seems, therefore, likely that pmeed is involved in the cytostatic activity of tc14- <dig> 

in this study, we aimed to disclose why and how only tc14- <dig> exerts the unique cytostatic activity in p. misakiensis. first, we examined amino acid moieties responsible for the cell growth-inhibitory activity of tc14- <dig>  using chimeric and mutant proteins, we demonstrate that protein dimerization and ca2+ binding motifs are essential for the cytostatic activity of tc14- <dig>  second, downstream genes of tc14- <dig> were looked for, using wild-type and mutant proteins. we present evidence that pmeed is up-regulated in vivo and in vitro by wild-type tc14- <dig>  in relation to eed induction, we show immunocytochemically histone h <dig> trimethylation in polyandrocarpa cell nuclei. using rna interference , rescue experiments were done to demonstrate that pmeed mediates the cell growth-inhibitory activity of tc14- <dig>  taken together, budding tunicates provide us with a unique and interesting system in which a coelomic polypeptide can induce a pcg gene and epigenetic histone modification.

RESULTS
survey of functional domains for cytostatic activity of tc14-3
two chimeric proteins containing complementary fragments from tc14- <dig> and tc14- <dig> were constructed . one of the chimeric proteins  consisted of n-terminal tc14- <dig> and c-terminal tc14- <dig>  it reversibly blocked cell growth, similar to wild-type tc14- <dig> . the other chimeric protein , like tc14- <dig>  did not show such activity , suggesting that the active site for cell growth inhibition are located in the c-terminal region of tc14- <dig>  in growth-arrested cells, the transcription of both cyclin a and cyclin b was suppressed .

next, we surveyed the polypeptide domains necessary for the cytostatic activity of tc14- <dig>  phe <dig> in the α <dig> helix, glu <dig> in loop  <dig>  and asn <dig> in loop  <dig> were changed to asp, gly, and gly, respectively. tc14-3f65d and tc14-3e106g completely lost cytostatic activity , and tc14-3n109g exhibited lower activity , suggesting that α <dig> helix and loop  <dig> are important for cytostatic activity. however, because both phe <dig> and glu <dig> are conserved in both tc14- <dig> and tc14- <dig> , these amino acids are insufficient to explain the unique cytostatic activity of tc14- <dig> 

+++, cytostatic activities remained strong.

++, cytostatic activities faintly decreased.

+, cytostatic activities were weakened to a large extent.

-, cytostatic activities were almost lost.

amino acids involved in tc14-3-specific protein dimerization and cytostatic activity
tc14- <dig> exhibited a relative electrophoretic mobility of  <dig> kda  on sds-page following heat denaturation, while under non-heated conditions, more than 99% of the total protein exhibited a relative mobility of  <dig> kda . in contrast, tc14- <dig> exhibited a single band of  <dig> kda following heat denaturation  and separated into  <dig> bands of  <dig> and  <dig> kda under non-heated conditions . the 28-kda form of tc14- <dig> accounted for approximately 61% of the total amount of protein . the chimeric protein, tc14-221-60/tc14-361- <dig> exhibited an electrophoretic pattern similar to that of wild-type tc14- <dig> . these results strongly suggest that wild-type tc14- <dig> may form more stable dimers than wild-type tc14- <dig> 

*, sds-page was done under non-heated condition. after staining, each band was scanned with a gel scanner.

**, tc14-2r69t had a few intermediate bands, so that the sum of monomer and dimer did not attain to 100%.

the mutant protein tc14-3f65d failed to dimerize . at the extremity of the α <dig> helix , thr <dig> of tc14- <dig> was exchanged with arg <dig> of tc14- <dig>  under heat denaturation, tc14-3t69r exhibited a major band of approximately  <dig> kda instead of  <dig> kda , and under the non-heated condition, it yielded  <dig> bands of  <dig> and  <dig> kda , similar to wild-type tc14- <dig>  on the other hand, heat-denatured tc14-2r69t exhibited a major band of  <dig> kda , similar to wild-type tc14- <dig>  in contrast, the non-heated sample of tc14-2r69t yielded  <dig> bands of  <dig> and  <dig> kda, intermediate between wild-type tc14- <dig> and tc14- <dig> .

tc14-3t69r exhibited no cytostatic activity on cultured tunicate cells . tc14-2r69t, on the other hand, acquired the cytostatic activity to some extent . as a reference, the amino acid at position  <dig> was exchanged between tc14- <dig> and tc14- <dig>  the cytostatic activity of the mutant proteins was unaffected .

these results indicate that the amino acid at position  <dig> can modulate multiple characteristics of tc14s, such as electrophoretic mobility, stability of protein dimers, and cytostatic activity.

amino acids involved in tc14-3-specific ca2+ binding and cytostatic activity
we next focused on the amino acids at positions  <dig> and  <dig> in loop  <dig> of tc14s . although single mutations  did not improve calcium binding, the double mutation tc14-3k113s.n114e bound to calcium at a molar ratio of approximately  <dig>  , a value intermediate between wild-type tc14- <dig> and wild-type tc14- <dig> .

both tc14-3k113s and tc14-3n114e retained their growth-inhibitory activities on cultured cells . on the other hand, the inhibitory activity was greatly diminished in the double mutant protein tc14-3k113s.n114e . mutations at c-terminal positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> did not have any apparent influence on cell growth .

only wild-type tc14- <dig> can induce pmeed
we examined whether tc14- <dig> influenced the gene expression of pmeed. cultured cells of polyandrocarpa were treated for  <dig> days with pbs, wild-type tc14- <dig>  tc14-3t69r, or tc14-3e106g. pmeed cdna could be amplified by rt-pcr only when wild-type tc14- <dig> was applied to cells . the amount of pmeed continued to increase during pcr cycles .

in intact animals, pmeed was expressed abundantly from bud stages to juvenile zooid stages , but diminished conspicuously at adult zooid stages except the gonad  . in this study, adult zooids were cut into  <dig> pieces to facilitate tc14- <dig> infiltration, and treated with tc14- <dig> proteins for  <dig> days. zooids of p. misakiensis possess a high potential for regeneration  <cit> . as expected, control zooid pieces treated with pbs could survive during the course of study. they did not exhibit any apparent signals for pmeed in most tissues and organs except the gonad , similar to intact adult zooids, indicating that the surgery by itself did not affect pmeed expression. in contrast to the control, zooid pieces that had been treated with wild-type tc14- <dig> ubiquitously expressed pmeed , the expression pattern similar to buds. the strongest signal was detected in coelomic cells in the hemocoel . the atrial, gastric, and perivisceral epithelia also expressed pmeed . the epidermis showed moderate expression of pmeed, but muscle cells did not .

results of rt-pcr showed that only wild-type tc14- <dig> could induce in vivo pmeed . by semi-quantitative pcr, the pmeed products became visible at the 25th cycle , and increased exponentially thereafter . in the control, on the other hand, pmeed products became first visible at the 27th cycle , and increased parallel to the experiment . the result indicated that the amount of pmeed transcripts in wild-type tc14-3-treated animals was approximately 2-4-fold that of the control.

tc14- <dig> also induces mitochondrial respiratory gene
our recent study showed that in p. misakiensis, pmeed and mitochondrial respiratory genes were both inactivated during zooidal senescence and reactivated remarkably during budding . we examined, therefore, whether wild-type tc14- <dig> could induce not only pmeed but also cytochrome c oxidase  <dig>  in aged zooids. results of in situ hybridization showed that in the control, signals were hardly detectable in the body wall, pharynx, and visceral organs . in contrast, when tc14- <dig> was applied to zooids, a portion of epithelial cells and coelomic cells in the pharynx expressed pmcox <dig> strongly . the endostyle, digestive tract, and surrounding coelomic cells did not emit signals . the increasing curves of pcr products indicated that tc14-3-treated samples had larger amount of pmcox <dig> transcripts than untreated controls, although the difference was not so high .

trimethylation of histone h <dig> by tc14-3
anti-h3k27me <dig> antibody stained the in vivo nuclei of epithelial cells and coelomic cells in buds . nuclei of epidermal cells stained weakly , whereas those of the atrial epithelium, multipotent epithelial cells in p. misakiensis, stained heavily . in the hemocoel, many coelomic cells emitted strong signals , but differentiated cells such as morula cells did not have apparent signals in the nucleus .

cultured cells untreated with tc14- <dig> were not stained with anti-h3k27me <dig> antibody . cells treated with mutant protein  were stained weakly , whereas wild-type tc14-3-treated cells were stained heavily with the antibody . western blotting of in vitro cultured cells showed that anti-histone h <dig> antibody stained a single band of approximately  <dig> kda . anti-h3k27me <dig> antibody, on the other hand, did not stain any bands when cells were not treated or treated with tc14-3e106g , but stained a single band of  <dig> kda when cultured cells were treated with wild-type tc14- <dig> . we could not find in vivo differences in histone trimethylation between tc14-3-treated and untreated samples .

the gene expression of pmezh <dig>  a polyandrocarpa homolog of histone h3k <dig> methyltransferase, was examined. adult zooid fragments treated with wild-type tc14- <dig> showed the same strength of signals as those of untreated zooids . when cells were treated in vitro with wild-type or mutant tc14-3s, the signals were approximately the same as those of the control [see additional file  <dig> lanes 4-7). these results indicate that wild-type tc14- <dig> can induce h3k27me <dig> without affecting pmezh <dig> gene expression.

recovery from tc14-3-induced growth arrest by pmeed knockdown
we examined the effect of pmeed rnai on cell growth arrest by wild-type tc14- <dig>  double-stranded rna of pmeed  was introduced into cultured cells by electroporation. in the positive control, blunt electroporation was performed in the absence of dsrnapmeed, and the cells were allowed to grow for  <dig> days without tc14- <dig>  cells spread on the culture dish . in the negative control, cells were treated with tc14- <dig> after the blunt electroporation. cells formed many aggregates . in dsrnapmeed experiments, cells spread again in the presence of tc14- <dig> . the cell number was approximately twice as many as that of the negative control . the recovery value accounted for 65% compared to the positive control.

discussion
α <dig> helix and loop  <dig> are essential for the cytostatic activity of tc14-3
the results of the chimera experiments revealed that the amino acids at positions 61- <dig> in the c-terminal region of tc14- <dig> are responsible for cytostatic activity. the c-terminal region contains  <dig> α helix ,  <dig> β strands , and  <dig> loops  . in the α <dig> helix of tc14- <dig>  hydrophobic amino acids  play a key role in protein dimerization  <cit> . our study, using site-directed mutagenesis and sds-page of recombinant proteins, confirmed that in tc14- <dig>  phe <dig> of α <dig> helix is essential for protein dimerization and also critical for cytostatic activity.

tc14s are ca2+-binding proteins  <cit> . the ligands for calcium are the side-chain oxygen atoms of glu <dig> , asn <dig> , asp <dig> , and asp <dig> , as well as the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of asp <dig>   <cit> . in tc14- <dig>  glu <dig> of loop  <dig> played a key role in ca2+ binding, and the loss of ca2+ binding was associated with the loss of cytostatic activity. glu <dig> and asn <dig> of tc14s correspond to glu <dig> and asn <dig> of mannose-binding protein a , respectively. in mbp-a, double mutations, glu185gln and asn187asp, alter the sugar substrate specificity from mannose to galactose  <cit> .

in e-selectin, the sequence trp-ala-pro-gly-glu-pro  regulates carbohydrate-binding specificity  <cit> . if ala at position  <dig> is replaced with ser, the sugar specificity of the mutant e-selectin changes from sialic acid to mannose. an exactly identical sequence exists in loop  <dig> of tc14- <dig> . the corresponding sequence of tc14- <dig> was trp-ser-pro-asp-glu-pro. both tc14-3a103s and tc14-3g105d retained strong cytostatic activity . it is, therefore, unlikely that the loop  <dig> is responsible for the difference between tc14- <dig> and tc14- <dig>  although the loop  <dig> is essential for determining biological and biochemical features of tc14s.

angiostatin and endostatin are specific, potent inhibitors of endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis  <cit> . endostatin is a 20-kda c-terminal fragment of collagen xviii. tc14- <dig> is similar to endostatin in several respects. the x-ray structure of murine endostatin is similar to that of c-type lectin  <cit> . it lacks a characteristic ca2+-binding site, but instead binds zinc at the n-terminus. this metal binding enables the dimerization of human endostatin  <cit> . similar to tc14- <dig>  protein dimerization is essential for endostatin to carry out the antitumor activity  <cit> .

thr <dig> modulates tc14- <dig> dimerization
tc14- <dig> differed from tc14- <dig> in protein dimer stability. as phe <dig> of α <dig> helix is conserved in both tc14- <dig> and tc14- <dig>  we hypothesized that the differences in the biological and biochemical properties of tc14- <dig> and tc14- <dig> may consist in α <dig> helix neighboring phe <dig> 

the amino acids at position  <dig> of tc14- <dig> and tc14- <dig> are thr and arg, respectively. as arg has a large side chain, it would interfere with the fitting and hydrophobic bonds at the α <dig> helix between juxtaposing proteins. as expected, tc14-3t69r changed the electrophoretic mobility and the stability of protein dimers, and lost the cytostatic activity. in contrast, tc14-2r69t could not form stable dimers comparable to that of wild-type tc14- <dig>  this result suggests that additional as yet unidentified amino acids may contribute to the stability of protein dimers. however, it is undoubted that the amino acid at position  <dig> can modulate the biological and biochemical properties of tc14s.

lys <dig> and asn <dig> modulate ca2+ binding of tc14-3
the cytostatic activities of tc14- <dig> depend on calcium-dependent galactose binding  <cit> . therefore, we initially expected that the affinity of tc14- <dig> for calcium may be higher than that of tc14- <dig>  however, contrary to our expectation, the ca2+-binding affinity of tc14- <dig> was apparently lower than that of tc14- <dig> 

lys <dig> and asn <dig> are specific for tc14- <dig>  they are located at the boundary between loop  <dig> and the β <dig> strand. when both these amino acids were replaced with those of tc14- <dig>  the resultant tc14-3k113s.n114e exhibited an increase in ca2+-binding affinity  and a decrease in cytostatic activity. as mentioned, tc14-3n109g had low ca2+-binding affinity , and exhibited reduced cytostatic activity. taken together, tc14- <dig> appears to have the highest cytostatic activity when the binding ratio of protein to ca2+ is 1: <dig> .

pmeed mediates cytostatic activity of tc14-3
in p. misakiensis, the atrial epithelium is a transdifferentiation-competent, multipotent tissue  <cit> . it undergoes the terminal differentiation into the pharynx, gut, and brain when growing buds enter the developmental stage  <cit> . tc14- <dig> is induced remarkably during budding, and it disappears from the morphogenesis domain where transdifferentiation takes place  <cit> . this disappearance of tc14- <dig> may be caused by retinoic acid-inducible serine protease  <cit> . tc14- <dig> can block in vitro cell growth and differentiation in polyandrocarpa cell lines that have been established from explants of the atrial epithelium  <cit> . consequently, matsumoto et al.  <cit>  have argued that in p. misakiensis, tc14- <dig> serves as a negative regulator of terminal differentiation of multipotent cells.

in p. misakiensis, pmeed was developmentally regulated during budding cycle. the gene expression of pmeed was the highest at bud stages, gradually diminish during zooid growth, and was almost absent in somatic tissues and organs of adult zooids . this expression pattern was similar to that of tc <dig>  in the present study, wild-type tc14- <dig> could induce pmeed in both cultured cells and adult zooid tissues, and interestingly, mutant proteins with abnormalities in protein dimerization or ca2+ binding failed to induce pmeed.

semi-quantitative pcr analysis of zooid pieces revealed that in the presence of tc14- <dig>  the amount of pmeed transcripts was 2-4-fold higher than that of the control. this value seemed smaller than that expected from the results of in situ hybridization. this may be due to strong signals from the gonads in the control as well as the experiment. in fact, many gonads are embedded in the ventral body wall , and they particularly expressed pmeed in adult tissues in a tc14-3-independent manner. therefore, the net induction of pmeed may be much larger, if the background value in the gonad could be subtracted from the total signal.

in p. misakiensis, dsrnapmeed rescued cultured cells from the growth-inhibitory effect of wild-type tc14- <dig>  this result affords further evidence that pmeed is a downstream mediator of cytostatic tc14- <dig>  in mammals, when eed is deficient in es cells, pcg target genes are de-repressed  <cit> , leading to cell growth and differentiation. therefore, pcg is thought to play roles in stem cell renewal and inhibition of cell differentiation in es cells  <cit> . our results are consistent with these findings and notion in mammals.

other genes regulated by tc14-3
a previous study has shown that in p. misakiensis, tc14- <dig> up-regulates α-integrin gene expression  <cit> . in this study, wild-type tc14- <dig> suppressed the gene expression of both cyclin a and cyclin b. in drosophila, pcg directly down-regulates cyclin a  <cit> .

in p. misakiensis, mitochondrial respiratory complex genes are regulated in accordance with pmeed during budding life cycle . when wild-type tc14- <dig> was applied to zooid pieces of p. misakiensis, pmcox <dig> gene was up-regulated. this gene regulation may also be related to pmeed. however, it should be noted that, unlike pmeed, the expression of pmcox <dig> was not ubiquitous, but restricted around the pharynx. it is, therefore, possible that mitochondrial respiratory complex genes may be up-regulated via a route other than pmeed.

epigenetic histone h <dig> trimethylation involved in cell growth and differentiation
eed and ezh <dig> are the components of prc <dig> in pcg  <cit> . eed acts as ezh <dig> activator, and ezh <dig> catalyzes h3k27me <dig> in the so-called histone tail  <cit> . trimethylation of histone h3k <dig> recruits prc <dig> to the chromatin. prc <dig> possesses a discrete enzyme activity that modifies histone h2a, resulting in genome-wide, epigenetic gene repression  <cit> . polyandrocarpa histone h <dig> showed 100% sequence similarity to mammalian histone h <dig>  . rabbit anti-histone h3k27me <dig> antibody indeed stained nuclei of the atrial epithelium and coelomic cells in intact buds of p. misakiensis. our in vitro studies indicated that wild-type tc14- <dig> could induce h3k27me <dig> in polyandrocarpa cultured cells. it is notable that tc14- <dig> up-regulated the pmeed gene expression, but not pmezh <dig>  therefore, epigenetic trimethylation of histone h3k <dig> should be ascribable exclusively to enhanced pmeed gene expression.

in contrast with the atrial epithelium and coelomic cells, nuclei of epidermal cells and coelomic morula cells were stained very weakly with anti-h3k27me <dig> antibody. the epidermis is a specialized tissue to synthesize and secrete tunic components. morula cells are differentiated cells engaged in self-defense mechanisms. in the light of multipotency of the atrial epithelium  <cit> , it is probable that h3k27me <dig> is related to the block of terminal differentiation in budding tunicates. in es cells, stat <dig>  oct-3/ <dig>  and sox <dig> induce eed that influences h3k27me <dig> in the nucleus  <cit> . these transcription factors are essential for stem cell maintenance. although the atrial epithelium in tunicates is quite different from es cells in origin and developmental potential, the basic mechanism for keeping the multipotent cell state appears to be shared by tunicate cells and mammalian es cells.

trithorax group also modifies histone h <dig> by trimethylation of lys <dig>  however, the result of histone methylation is quite different from the case of pcg, making chromatin loose and activating differentiation genes  <cit> . in p. misakiensis, lys <dig> trimethylation occurs in the process of transdifferentiation, which will be reported in the near future.

CONCLUSIONS
as mentioned, tc14- <dig> is similar to endostatin in several aspects, but there are, of course, important differences between them. endostatin binds α5β <dig> integrin and e-selectin on the endothelium  <cit>  and inhibits the activity of metalloproteinases  <cit> . tc14- <dig>  on the other hand, exerts cell growth inhibition at least in part by inducing in vivo and in vitro pmeed. a major function of induced pmeed is to facilitate h3k27me <dig>  this system of budding tunicates consisting of a humoral factor, pcg, and histone trimethylation can regulate cell growth and differentiation of multipotent cells. consequently, the homeostatic maintenance of transdifferentiation-competent cells would support budding and regenerative activities in p. misakiensis. further studies of how humoral growth inhibitors such as endostatin and tc14- <dig> work in dimerization- and cation-dependent manners will afford insight into therapeutic control of malignant and/or multipotent cells and tissues.
