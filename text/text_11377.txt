BACKGROUND
the genus brucella comprises important mammal and human pathogens. low infectious doses , transmission through aerosols, and a difficult treatment of the disease by antibiotics, have led brucella to be classified as potential bioterrorism agents. the genus brucella  <cit>  belongs to the family brucellaceae within the order rhizobiales of the alphaproteobacteria. ochrobactrum, a soil living facultative human pathogen, is the most closely related genus  <cit>  with a 16s rrna gene sequence  more than 98% identical to that of brucella spp.

characterized brucella comprise six classical brucella species, b. melitensis, b. abortus, b. ovis, b. canis, b. suis, and b. neotomae, two species of marine mammal origin, namely b. pinnipedialis and b. ceti, and the recently described species b. microti and b. inopinata. b. microti was initially isolated from systemically diseased common voles  in the czech republic  <cit> . more recently, it has also been isolated from red foxes in lower austria  <cit>  and even directly from soil in the same geographical area  <cit> . importantly, b. microti is thus the only brucella species with a known reservoir outside of its mammalian host. recent and frequent isolations of b. microti from different animals from different geographical regions indicate that b. microti could constitute an emerging pathogen. all brucella species are genetically highly related, exhibiting identical 16s rrna and reca gene sequences  <cit> . in fact, dna-dna hybridization studies, today's gold standard for bacterial species delineation, suggest that all brucella spp. should be unified into a single species  and not be regarded as different species  <cit> . the high genetic relatedness of all brucella species was further confirmed by whole genome sequencing  <cit> .

although brucella spp. are facultative intracellular bacteria adapted to specific mammalian hosts, the whole genome sequence of b. suis revealed a clear similarity to that of soil bacteria associated with plants, such as agrobacterium and rhizobium  <cit> . it was therefore speculated that the mammal host-adapted brucella species evolved from a plant-associated soil living ancestor. the recent isolation of b. microti directly from soil supported this hypothesis. in addition to its persistence in soils, b. microti is unique in sharing other phenotypic traits with its closest phylogenetic relative ochrobactrum. in particular, b. microti is biochemically highly active, at odds with other brucella species, but a common feature among ochrobactrum species. we therefore speculated that b. microti might represent an intermediary stage in brucella evolution, closer to the brucella/ochrobactrum common ancestor. to substantiate this hypothesis, the whole genome sequence of b. microti was determined and compared to that of other brucella and to the genome sequence of o. anthropi. differences in gene content that could explain b. microti phenotypic peculiarities were carefully studied.

RESULTS
the genome sequence of brucella microti ccm 4915t was determined  by shotgun analysis using the gs-flx pyrosequencing technology and direct sanger sequencing of remaining gaps. the genome is composed of two circular chromosomes of lengths  <dig> , <dig> bp  and  <dig> , <dig> bp. we predicted the presence of  <dig>  protein coding genes,  <dig> trnas and  <dig> ribosomal rnas. a comparison with the other brucella genomes revealed the presence of  <dig> pseudogenes.

comparison of genome structures
dotplots  of the chromosomes of b. microti against the  <dig> brucella genome sequences available at the time of writing and the genome sequence of o. anthropi show that: i) the overall genome structures of brucella are remarkably conserved, ii) brucella genomes are markedly different from that of o. anthropi and iii) based on this genome structure only, b. microti is more similar to b. suis  <dig>  b. canis and b. melitensis 16m than to the other genomes with which it has at least one major difference. consistently, phylogenetic reconstruction based on a set of  <dig>  orthologous genes clearly placed b. microti closer to b. suis  <dig> than to any other brucella . we thus based our subsequent analyses on the detailed comparison of b. microti and b. suis  <dig> 

global alignment of the chromosomes
the global alignment of b. suis  <dig> and b. microti chromosomes revealed their almost perfect co-linearity. on chromosome  <dig>  we identified  <dig> indels  of one or more base-pairs in the alignment . on chromosome  <dig>  we identified  <dig> indels . insertions in b. microti range in size from  <dig> bp  to  <dig> bp on chromosome  <dig>  and from  <dig> bp  to  <dig>  bp on chromosome  <dig> . insertions in b. suis  <dig> range in size from  <dig> bp  to  <dig> bp on chromosome  <dig> and from  <dig> bp  to  <dig> bp on chromosome  <dig>  the global alignment of the chromosomes is given as additional files  <dig> and  <dig> and the list of indels between b. microti and b. suis  <dig> is reported in additional file  <dig> 

out of a total of  <dig> , <dig> aligned positions, we observed  <dig> snps, corresponding to  <dig> % nucleotide difference between the two species. in comparison, alignment of b. suis  <dig> with b. melitensis 16m revealed a total of  <dig> snp for a total of  <dig> , <dig> aligned nucleotides .

the  <dig> kbp insertion
the largest difference between the genome of b. suis  <dig> and that of b. microti is a  <dig> kbp insertion , that is unique to b. microti . this insertion is located in chromosome  <dig> , between a gene for trnaleu and gene bmi_ii <dig>  ortholog of bra <dig> in b. suis  <dig> genome. a significant, but partial match to a phage integrase  was detected at an extremity of this island . this putative integrase is flanked by an orf  showing similarity with phage excisionases. altogether, these findings suggest that the  <dig> kbp genome insertion originates from a yet unidentified phage. moreover, the target for this insertion was a ggcacca motif, found both at the end of the trna, and identically conserved at the end of the insert. accordingly, most of the other orfs within this island exhibit remote similarities with phage orfs in protein sequence databases. however, these phage-derived genes now appear defective, as the sequence homology only partially cover the orfs. interestingly, a predicted gene in this region  has a best match against o. anthropi . finally, this b. microti specific genomic island bears no similarity with the  <dig>  kbp island recently reported in the genome of b. ovis  <cit> . the origin of this insertion remains unclear since its tentative detection by a recently developed specific pcr  <cit>  with brucella phage dna  as template was negative. therefore, it seems unlikely that the insertion has derived from the most commonly known brucella phages.

insertion sequences
insertion sequences of the is711/is <dig> family are commonly found in brucella, but other is elements are also present scattered through the genomes. in b. microti, we identified  <dig> copies of is <dig> elements,  <dig> is <dig> elements,  <dig> is <dig> elements,  <dig> isbm <dig> elements, one of them disrupted by the insertion of an is <dig> element, one isbm <dig> element and one isbm <dig> element. the main difference with respect to b. suis  <dig> is the number of is <dig> insertion sequences. is <dig> insertion sequences which are not present in both b. microti and b. suis  <dig> are listed in table  <dig>  seven are present in b. microti only and one in b. suis  <dig> only. interestingly, those changes are all found on the large chromosome. the insertion site between bmi_i <dig> and cobl has already been reported in b. microti  <cit> , and the insertion site between trnamet and omp <dig>  was previously thought to be specific of brucella isolated from marine mammals  <cit> . one of those insertions impairs a hypothetical protein in b. suis  <dig>  and in two other cases, the insertion is located in the 5' upstream-region of a gene  but does not seem to disrupt a putative promoter  <cit> . none of the insertions thus appear to disrupt existing operon structures or inactivate putative promoters.

for each insertion sequence, the genomic position of the insertion sequence and of the inserted position in the cognate genome are given.

tandem repeat analysis
the mlva- <dig> typing systems  <cit> , based on multilocus vntr  and extended later into mlva- <dig>  <cit>  used a set of primer pairs , selected for their variability in a set of three brucella genomes. we searched for these primers in the genome of b. microti and reported their positions and the theoretical lengths of the corresponding pcr products in additional file  <dig>  of the  <dig> primer pairs reported in  <cit> ,  <dig> had a perfect match to the b. microti genome sequence, and two exhibited one mismatch in one of the primers . the genomic positions leading to vntr amplicons of different sizes between b. microti and b. suis  <dig>  as well as other indels, are listed in additional file  <dig>  on the  <dig> mlva- <dig> primer pairs,  <dig> yield pcr fragments of different sizes. this explains the differences in the mlva profile of b. microti with respect to other brucella

for each gene, we indicate its status in the other brucella and o. anthropi. this table only includes the genes that are discussed in the text. a more extensive version of this table is given as additional file  <dig> 

abbreviations include: * for internal stop, a number indicates multiple stops, fs for frameshift, + for an intact sequence, mult. diffs for multiple difference, mult. fs for multiple frameshifts, nf for not found.

ribosomal rna
brucella contains three copies of the ribosomal rna operon. the sequences of 5s and 16s ribosomal rna genes are nearly identical among all species. in contrast, we noticed that the 23s ribosomal rna gene sequence of b. microti differs markedly from that of the other brucella , and that the differences map into the intervening sequence  localized in the helix  <dig>  cleaved by the rnase iii during the maturation of the 23s rrna. interestingly, the b. microti ivs region differs from that of o. anthropi, but is very similar to that of another fast growing brucella, b. inopinata sp. nov. strain b <dig>  <cit> , whose genome sequence is in the form of  <dig> contigs on the patric web site  <cit> . curiously, the similarity between b. microti and b. inopinata b <dig> is limited to this particular 23s rrna region, whereas the rest of their genome sequences are notably different, for instance showing different theoretical pcr fragment size for  <dig> of the  <dig> mlva- <dig> primer pairs that we were able to locate on the preliminary data . additionally, a tree built from a fragment of brucella genomes  showed that b. inopinata b <dig> likely diverged before b. microti from the other brucella . the alignment of the brucella ivs i regions is presented in figure  <dig> and an analysis of the secondary structure of the ivs regions in figure  <dig>  in this figure, the black boxes correspond to previously identified conserved motifs  <cit> . the nucleotides around the putative cleavage site  are well conserved in all brucella, except for b. microti where the cug consensus cleavage motif is split. in contrast to this ivs i region which is shared between b. microti and b. inopinata b <dig>  a second region, between positions  <dig> and  <dig> in the alignment , is perfectly identical between o. anthropi and b. microti, and distinct from b. inopinata b <dig> which is identical to other brucella in this region.

gene content analysis and comparison with other brucella and ochrobactrum anthropi
genes differentially annotated or presenting notable differences between b. microti and b. suis  <dig> are listed in table  <dig>  and additional file  <dig> . we reported the status of each of these genes in the other brucella and o. anthropi, as well as the nature of the change at the sequence level that turns the intact gene in b. microti or b. suis  <dig> into a pseudogene in the other organisms. in agreement with the observation  that the branch length leading to b. microti is shorter than those leading to other brucella, we note  that the number of pseudogenes in b. microti is half that of b. suis  <dig> 

genes specific to b. microti and o. anthropi and impaired in all other brucella
in term of metabolic capabilities, b. microti  was experimentally found much more similar to o. anthropi than to other brucella. we thus examined the gene content of b. microti to identify genes shared with o. anthropi but impaired in all other sequenced brucella. only  <dig> such genes were found. phylogenetic trees for those genes are shown in additional file  <dig> 

bmi_i <dig> has an ortholog in o. anthropi  and is impaired in other brucella. in b. suis  <dig>  the corresponding pseudogene is br <dig>  homologues for this gene are found in many rhizobiales such as bartonella or mezorhizobium . the enzyme encoded by this gene, malate dehydrogenase   , is involved in pyruvate metabolism. the reaction is: - malate + nadp+ = pyruvate + co <dig> + nadph. this gene has a paralog bmi_i <dig>  the orthologs of which are intact in all brucella and ochrobactrum .

bmi_i <dig>  corresponding to pseudogene br <dig> in b. suis  <dig>  is an aspartyl/asparaginyl beta-hydroxylase which is intact in b. microti and o. anthropi  and impaired in other brucella . the product of this gene  catalyzes the reaction: peptide-l-aspartate + 2-oxoglutarate + o <dig> = peptide-3-hydroxy-l-aspartate + succinate + co <dig>  the succinate , product of this reaction, is one of the compounds used in the physiological reactions that differentiate b. microti from other brucella  <cit> . succinate is involved in many metabolic pathways such as the citrate cycle .

bmi_i <dig>  corresponding to pseudogene br <dig> in b. suis  <dig> is intact in b. microti, impaired in other brucella, and intact in o. anthropi  . this gene is predicted to encode an extracellular solute-binding protein belonging to an abc-type transport system probably involved in dipeptide transport. however, in the case of b. microti, the nearby dppc gene encoding the permease component of this transport system is impaired , with probable consequences on the whole transport system.

bmi_ii <dig>  encoding a transcriptional regulator of the marr family is present in b. microti and o. anthropi  and contains an internal stop codon in other brucella . it corresponds to pseudogene bra <dig> in b. suis  <dig>  this family of transcriptional regulators mediates the response to multiple environmental stresses and the resistance to multiple antibiotics.

finally, the b. microti hydrolase bmi_i2199/br <dig>  is similar to the one in o. anthropi, while its homologues in other brucella species are much shorter, lacking the last  <dig> amino-acids, which is likely to have functional consequences. its homologues in b. canis and b. suis atcc  <dig> are annotated as acetyltransferases, part of the acetoin cleaving system.

genes intact in b. microti and o. anthropi and impaired in almost all other brucella
some genes are intact in b. microti and o. anthropi but are impaired in almost all brucella, with some exceptions. for instance, the atp-dependent helicase htrb , pseudogene br <dig> in b. suis  <dig>  presents a frameshift in all brucella except b. ovis  and is intact in o. anthropi. this is also the case for bmi_i <dig> corresponding to pseudogene br <dig> in b. suis  <dig>  this gene exhibits an internal stop codon in all brucella except b. abortus s <dig>  and is present in o. anthropi . this gene encodes a transport protein sometimes annotated as outer membrane protein e. the gene encoding sarcosine dehydrogenase , corresponding to pseudogene br <dig> in b. suis  <dig>  is intact in b. microti and o. anthropi but impaired in other brucella except brucella suis atcc  <dig>  this enzyme catalyzes the following reaction: sarcosine + acceptor + h2o = glycine + formaldehyde + reduced acceptor. the flagellar motor switch gene, flig , which is apparently intact in b. ovis, b. microti and o. anthropi, is impaired in other brucella.

other potentially significant differences in gene content between b. microti and other brucella
glutamate metabolism
quite a number of genes involved in glutamate metabolism are missing from certain brucella species.

the gene of glutamate decarboxylase beta  contains an in-frame stop codon in b. suis  <dig> and appears to be damaged in many brucella . the product of this gene catalyzes the decarboxylation of glutamate into gamma-aminobutyric acid  and co <dig>  the nearby glutamate/gamma-aminobutyrate antiporter  is also impaired in b. suis  <dig>  presenting an internal frameshift as in b. ovis, b. canis and b. suis atcc  <dig>  taken together, these two genes are only intact in b. microti . these two genes are involved in the generation of a proton motive force in lactobacillus strains  <cit> , but also in acid resistance mechanisms  <cit> .

also involved in glutamate and other amino-acids metabolisms, the b. suis  <dig> gene  encoding a n-acetylglucosamine kinase presents a frameshift and is thus impaired in b. microti . this enzyme  catalyzes the following reaction: atp + n-acetyl-d-glucosamine = adp + n-acetyl-d-glucosamine 6-phosphate.

the proline/dehydrogenase/delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase  is a pseudogene in b. suis  <dig> . this enzyme  catalyzes the reaction: -1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate + nad+ +  <dig> h2o = l-glutamate +nadh + h+ and is involved in glutamate, arginine and proline metabolism.

membrane proteins presenting significant differences between b. microti and other brucella
we also observed a number of changes in genes encoding membrane proteins. the outer membrane protein encoding gene bmi_i <dig> exhibits large differences in size, being larger in b. microti than in its counterparts in other brucella. a small conductance mechanosensitive ion channel protein encoding gene  has frameshifts in b. suis  <dig> , b. ovis and b. canis and is intact in b. microti and o. anthropi. a second small conductance mechanosensitive ion channel protein encoding gene  is impaired in b. suis  <dig> , b. canis and b. ovis

an outer membrane autotransporter, encoded by bmi_ii <dig>  is paradoxically most similar to the protein meso_ <dig> in mesorhizobium sp. bnc <dig> than to its homologues in all brucella and ochrobactrum.

the b. microti membrane protein bme <dig>  encoded by bmi_ii <dig>  corresponds to pseudogene bra <dig> in b. suis  <dig>  genes at this locus have been reported to be involved in polysaccharide synthesis  <cit> .

the ortholog of gene bmi_ii <dig>  encoding a cell wall surface hemagglutinin in b. microti, presents a premature stop codon in b. suis  <dig> . remarkably, a fragment of this gene, position  <dig> to  <dig> in b. microti chromosome  <dig> sequence, is found multiple times in brucella genomes. its abundance  ranges between  <dig> times in b. ovis to  <dig> times in b. microti and b. suis atcc  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> times in the other brucella studied in this work. this repeated element could reveal useful for typing purpose.

b. microti gene bmi_i <dig> is quite different in length with respect to its counterparts in other brucella. the b. microti version has a  <dig> nucleotides insert. this gene encodes a protein with a yada-like c-terminal domain characteristic of a family of surface exposed bacterial proteins. o. anthropi has no homolog for this gene.

gene clusters encoding the components of the flagellum
all genes involved in flagella assembly and present in o. anthropi are apparently intact in b. microti, in contrast to the situation in other brucella where at least one gene is impaired . however, there is a significant difference in flagella gene organization between ochrobactrum spp. and brucella spp. in o. anthropi, the flagella genes are essentially found in two clusters. one contains flhb, flig, flin, flim, mota, flgf, flii, flgb, flgc, flie, flgg, flga, flgi, flgh, flil, flip and the other contains flir, flha, fliq, flgd, flbt, flaf, flgl, flgk, flge, flik, motc, motb, flif, flic. in brucella, a  <dig> kb insert containing genes not related to flagella interrupts the first group between genes flii and flgb .

status of the genes involved in flagella assembly in o. anthropi, b. microti and  <dig> brucella . the genes are grouped in two loci in o. anthropi. the first locus is interrupted by a  <dig> kb insertion in brucella. a) a gene annotated as flig is present in the genome sequence of b. melitensis 16m. however, the predicted protein is shorter than it should be and is probably a pseudogene . in brucella, locus  <dig> is interrupted by a  <dig> kbp insert, between flii and flgb.

survival in the soil
paulsen et al.  <cit>  noticed that the b. suis operon , encoding an homoprotocatechuate pathway, is widely distributed among diverse soil microorganisms and may contribute to the survival of the bacteria outside of its host. interestingly,  <dig> of these genes present a frameshift in b. microti, suggesting that they do not significantly contribute to its survival in the soil. in contrast, an other operon cited in the same context   <cit> , encoding a beta-ketoadipate pathway is intact in both b. suis  <dig> and b. microti.

discussion
voges-proskauer reaction
in terms of metabolic capabilities, b. microti  was found much more similar to o. anthropi than to other brucella. one of the tests for which b. microti was positive is the voges-proskauer reaction. the voges-proskauer reaction demonstrates the possibility for an organism to produce acetoin and  <dig> -butanediol and is an established biochemical test for distinguishing wide classes of bacteria. the pathway leading to the production of acetoin is described for instance in  <cit> . it involves the transformation of pyruvate into alpha-acetolactate by the acetolactate synthase, then the conversion of alpha-acetolactate to acetoin by the alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase followed by the conversion of acetoin to  <dig> -butanediol. brucella species possess genes for the acetolactate synthase  <dig>  and the acetolactate synthase  <dig> . the conversion of acetoin to  <dig> -butanediol is performed by the homolog of also  in vibrio cholera which is bmi_i <dig>  a gene apparently missing from this pathway is the homolog of alsd  in v. cholera, the alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase. however, as reported for bacillus subtilis  <cit> , this reaction can occur spontaneously at low ph, in absence of alsd. this suggests that known brucella species have all the enzymes necessary to produce acetoin. their negative testing for the voges-proskauer reaction might thus be due to an indirect cause, such as the lack of a sufficient supply of pyruvate. like o. anthropi, but in contrast with other brucella, b. microti possesses two paralogs of malate dehydrogenase  which catalyzes a reaction producing pyruvate. it is thus tempting to speculate that this enzyme duplication might be linked to the positivity of the voges-proskauer reaction in b. microti.

proton motive force and acid-resistance mechanism
of notable interest is the presence of the gene tandem bmi_ii <dig> and bmi_ii <dig> encoding a glutamate decarboxylase beta gadb and a glutamate/gamma-aminobutyrate antiporter gadc, respectively. these proteins might give b. microti the potential to generate a proton motive force from the decarboxylation of glutamate. this capacity might have been lost in other brucella where either of these genes are found impaired. in lactococcus lactis  <cit> , shigella flexneri  <cit>  and escherichia coli  <cit>  gadb and gadc were shown to participate in a glutamate-dependent acid resistance mechanism. acid resistance mechanisms allow enteric pathogens to overcome acid stress in the gastrointestinal tract of their host  <cit> . in the case of b. microti, this system may help the bacteria to survive in acid soils. more importantly, it might also play a role in intracellular survival, as within hosts macrophages, brucella species reside in a low ph environment, where the importance of the gadb, gadc, hdea gene cluster as an acid resistance locus as already been suggested  <cit> .

motility
due to their lifestyle, many intracellular bacteria have lost their capacity to produce functional flagella  <cit> . despite the presence of numerous flagella genes  <cit> , burkholderia mallei is non-motile whereas burkholderia pseudomallei and burkholderia thailendensis are motile. the lack of motility of b. mallei was traced back to a  <dig> kb insertion within the flip gene as well as a frameshift in the flagellar motor gene motb  <cit> . similarly, yersinia pseudotuberculosis and yersinia enterocolitica are motile  <cit>  whereas yersinia pestis kim is non-motile in spite of the presence of a nearly complete set of flagella genes, but with a truncated gene for transcription factor flhd. in each of the above cases, the host adapted species are non-motile  whereas the others are motile. although all available brucella genomes possess genes for the flagellum complex, brucella are non-motile and display no flagellum under standard conditions. however, under specific conditions during early exponential growth phase, b. melitensis 16m has been reported to express some of the key genes of the flagellar apparatus and assemble a sheathed flagellum which is required for virulence in a mouse infection model  <cit> .

the motor switch gene flig is the gene most often found impaired in brucella , with exceptions in b. ovis and b. microti. this rotor protein is essential for the assembly and the function of the flagellar motor  <cit> . in b. ovis, flim, encoding the flagellar c ring protein is impaired , explaining the lack of flagella in b. ovis. in contrast with these brucella species, b. microti does not present a readily apparent defect among the proteins constituting the flagellar assembly complex. its lack of a visible flagellum could thus be due to more subtle causes. in this context, we noticed that one of the two flagella gene clusters of o. anthropi is split in brucella genomes . such a modification might have disrupted the coordinated expression of those flagella genes. however, given the integrity of its individual flagellar genes, b. microti might express a sheathed flagellum under specific conditions, as observed for b. melitensis 16m  <cit> .

the  <dig> kbp insertion
the specific  <dig> kbp genomic island of probable phage origin is of obvious interest for identification purpose, and has already been used for the recovery of b. microti from soil samples  <cit> . blast  searches of nucleotide sequences within this island against the genbank database found best matches in o. anthropi, nitrobacter hamburgensis x <dig> and other rhizobiales. this suggests that this element originated from a phage commonly infecting rhizobiales. in a recent study  <cit> , evidence of horizontal gene transfers in brucella genomes were reported. those sars  consist of regions  <dig> to  <dig> kb long, sometimes flanked on one side by a trna and on the other side by a fragment of that trna, as found in the b. microti genomic island. although some important genes  apparently entered the brucella genomes through this mechanism, the b. microti island appears devoid of functional genes. paradoxically, the most striking genome structure difference between b. microti and other brucella is probably of no phenotypic consequence.

23s ribosomal rna
the cleavage of the 23s rrna ivss by rnase iii results in a specific fragmentation pattern. in b. microti, the 5' fragment is predicted to be  <dig> bp long, the ivs i   <dig> bp long and the 3' fragment  <dig>  kbp long. the ivs is composed of palindrome sequences and repeated motifs forming stable secondary structures    <cit> . the complementary ends of the ivs are highly conserved between brucella species and correspond to inverted dna repeats characteristic of mobile genetic elements  <cit> . in b. microti, the 23s maturation leading to the ivs removal may not occur because of sequence variations at the cleavage site. in salmonella typhimurium, rnase iii- mutants are viable, suggesting that the removal of the intervening sequence is not required for 23s function  <cit> . the fragmentation of 23s rrna during post-transcriptional processing of precursor rrna has been reported for brucella  <cit> , however, no information is available concerning b. microti. concerning the role of the 23s rrna fragmentation, results in salmonella  <cit>  indicate that the degree of fragmentation correlates with the amount of 23s rrna degradation in stationary phase, allowing for a post-transcriptional control of ribosome production. knowing that two fast-growing brucella isolates, b. microti and b. inopinata b <dig>  share a similar change in their 23s rrna structure, it is tempting to speculate that this change, impeding ivs removal, could have an impact on their growth rates. it is surprising that two phylogenetically distant species of brucella, as revealed by sequence analysis of vntr regions and phylogenetic analysis , have exactly the same ivs sequence. this finding pleads either for an ancestral nature of this ivs or for a recent exchange of 23s rrna sequences between b. inopinata b <dig> and b. microti. however, part of the 23s rrna gene sequence of b. microti was found identical to that of o. anthropi, this region not being shared with b. inopinata b <dig>  this mosaic structure of the 23s rrna gene sequence of b. microti, partly identical to that of b. inopinata b <dig> and partly identical to that of o. anthropi confirms the existence of horizontal gene transfers in brucella.

brucella virulence genes
major virulence factors of brucella that have been characterized include the type iv secretion system  <cit> , lps  <cit> , omp <dig>  <cit> , and the bvrs-bvrr two component system  <cit> . all of these virulence gene sequences were found to be identical in b. microti and b. suis  <dig>  interestingly, two orfs involved in lps biosynthesis as well as omp <dig> are found in one of the nine genomic islands  which were revealed by whole-genome micro-array analysis in b. melitensis 16m  <cit> .

phylogeny of the genus brucella
the newly determined genome sequence of b. microti allows us to revisit the phylogeny of the brucella genus. our results  are in agreement with previous works  <cit>  which regroup on one hand b. suis  <dig>  b. suis atcc  <dig> and b. canis, and on the other hand b. abortus s <dig>  b. abortus 9– <dig> and b. melitensis biovar abortus  <dig> together with b. melitensis 16m. b. microti and b. ovis separated earlier from those groups. it was claimed  <cit>  that the b. ovis lineage was "basal" to the rest of the brucella lineage, dating the divergence of most brucella species from their common ancestor  <dig>  to  <dig>  years ago. our analyses now indicate that the b. microti lineage is at least as "basal" as b. ovis, and anticipating on the completion of its genome sequence, the divergence of b. inopinata b <dig> will probably appear even more ancestral.

CONCLUSIONS
unexpectedly in the light of its numerous phenotypic peculiarities, b. microti was found to have a genome sequence very close to that of previously characterized brucella species. with respect to its closest relative, b. suis  <dig>  the genome sequence of b. microti was found  <dig> % identical in perfectly aligned regions, and no less than 99% identical taking into account insertion-deletions. although we identified at least  <dig> genes impaired in all studied brucella but intact in b. microti and o. anthropi, it is unlikely that these differences alone could explain the numerous ochrobactrum-like phenotypic traits exhibited by b. microti, as well as its increased virulence. additionally, we have identified an unexpected alteration of the 23s rrna gene sequence of b. microti, also shared by an other fast growing novel brucella species b. inopinata sp. nov. strain b <dig>  this sequence variation could have a pleiotropic effect by increasing the number of ribosomes per bacterial cell and thus enhance the overall translation activity. finally, the phenotypic characteristics of b. microti might also be due to genome variations in non-coding  regions influencing the expression level of numerous genes. our study appears to be the first encountering a new limitation of the comparative genomic approach in the elucidation of phenotypic traits: usually even close  strains display too many differences in their genomes to allow the straightforward identification of the relevant genes. here, we experienced the opposite problem, being left with too few gene differences to explain a large number of phenotypic variations. a differential analysis of the transcriptome of b. microti vs. that of its closest genomic relative b. suis  <dig> as well as complementation studies should help reveal how their quasi-identical gene content could result in two microorganisms exhibiting so many differences in their metabolic behaviors, life-styles, and virulence.
