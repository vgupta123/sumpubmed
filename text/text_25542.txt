BACKGROUND
stressful life events are among the most potent factors that can trigger the development of psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety disorders  <cit> . aberrations in the function of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal  axis, the key control system of the body to balance stress hormones and the response to stress, already exist prior to the onset of clinical symptoms  <cit> . the functionality of the hpa axis is mainly governed by genetic endowment, but developmental influences and life events, in particular stress experience early in life, can re-program the settings of the hpa axis  <cit> .

the hypothalamus, as part of the hpa axis, is the centre of stress response and a region of the brain that integrates different stress signalling neuronal pathways. the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus  is the main area of the hypothalamus where the corticotropin-releasing hormone , the crucial neuropeptide that activates the secretion of corticotropin , is produced and released. this effect, in turn, causes the secretion of glucocorticoids from the adrenal glands  <cit> . the levels of acth and glucocorticoids in the plasma can be used as markers to monitor stress levels  <cit> . in addition to crh, other hormonal molecules such as arginine vasopressin  and oxytocin contribute to the regulation of the hpa axis' activity  <cit> .

in major depression a hypothalamic hyper-drive is observed. this is constituted by the elevation of crh, avp and oxytocin, which may influence the clinical symptoms. in the pvn of depressed patients the total number of crh expressing neurons showing co-localisation with avp and the amount of crh-mrna are increased  <cit> . an important hallmark of hpa axis regulation is the negative feedback exerted by glucocorticoids on the production and release of crh and avp in the pvn, as well as of acth in the pituitary. substantial evidence has been provided that this attenuation activity, which is an integral part of the stress response, is impaired in patients suffering from major depression  <cit> .

recently, we have determined stress-regulated genes in the hippocampus, a higher limbic centre in the brain, of two inbred mouse strains with differential psycho-phenotype, namely c57bl/6j and the dba/2j by employing microarray analysis  <cit> . the choice of these mouse strains is based on reports that these strains have differential response to stress  <cit> , differential basal anxiety  <cit>  and differ in both, their cognitive abilities  <cit>  and sensitivity to antidepressants  <cit> . the microarray method, that belongs to the chip-based whole genome technologies, allows for unbiased approaches with the potential to identify new candidate genes and gene networks  <cit> . our results had led to the successful identification of stress-regulated genes and suggestion of possible signal transduction pathways involved.

as it is of great interest to study the impact of stress in brain regions directly involved in stress regulation, in this parallel study we have focused on the impact of stress experience on hypothalamic pvn governing the stress response. the pvn area was micropunctured from the brains of c57bl/6j and dba/2j mice that had been stressed once by forced swimming  <cit>  and mrna profiles were determined by microarray analysis. forced swimming is also being used routinely as test to monitor depression-like behaviour and drug effects  <cit> . we report that guanine nucleotide binding protein, alpha inhibiting  <dig> and amyloid β  precursor protein  are up-regulated after stress and we suggest a novel gene network involved in stress response in the two mouse strains. this network implies that the expression of app might be a neuroprotective component of stress adaptation in the pvn.

RESULTS
basal gene expression differences between c57bl/6j and dba/2j mice in pvn
to compare expression profiles between the two mouse strains c57bl/6j and dba/2j and evaluate expression changes at different time points after stress exposure, we used cdna microarrays. we first evaluated the differences of the two mouse strains in their basal expression profile in the pvn . the microarray analysis revealed  <dig> genes with more than  <dig>  fold difference in expression.

among the most pronounced expression differences we identified genes with a variety of function, such as protein kinase activity, genes with extracellular ligand-gated ion channel activity, genes involved in protein homeostasis , cell surface , and chromosomal processes ; examples are provided in table  <dig> .

acth and gene expression profiles after forced swimming
to determine transcriptional profiles after stress, mice had been subjected to forced swimming for  <dig> min at 8: <dig> h or 12: <dig> h and then decapitated at 16: <dig> h in order to isolate the brains for our microarray studies as previously described  <cit>  . in this previous study the impact of forced swim stress on stimulation of the hpa axis was evaluated by the determination of corticosterone  levels in the serum. in order to monitor the activation of the pituitary that responds to the crf release, we also measured the acth levels. a set of animals of both strains was decapitated directly after stress exposure at 08: <dig> h and at 12: <dig> h . the results show a clear increase for acth after stress in both mouse strains and at both time points selected in our study , like previously also for cort  <cit> . thus, the pituitary as well as the adrenals responded immediately to the stressor. when animals were decapitated  <dig> h or  <dig> h after the stress, the levels of acth were not different from the non stressed controls, indicative of a functional negative feedback mechanism . the levels in non-stressed and stressed animals were higher at 16: <dig> than in the morning though, most likely due to the circadian rhythm of the mice.

to reveal gene expression differences, samples from non stressed mice were compared to samples from mice that had been stressed  <dig> h or  <dig> h before decapitation. in c57bl/6j mice,  <dig> genes were ≥ <dig>  fold regulated  <dig> h after stress and  <dig> genes  <dig> h after stress. in dba/2j mice,  <dig> genes and  <dig> genes were regulated at the respective time points. .

examples of the most interesting regulated genes are highlighted in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  5: in c57bl/6j mice, among the genes regulated  <dig> h after stress we distinguish phosphodiesterase 1c , mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase  <dig>  and polymerase  delta  <dig>  catalytic subunit  . in the group of genes regulated  <dig> h after stress we noticed heat shock protein  <dig>  alpha , guanine nucleotide binding protein, alpha o  and the regulator of g-protein signaling  <dig>  .

in dba/2j mice, among the genes regulated  <dig> h after stress, mitogen activated protein kinase  <dig> , guanine nucleotide binding protein, alpha inhibiting  <dig> , nuclear factor of activated t-cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent  <dig>  were most striking , while among the genes regulated  <dig> h after stress amyloid beta  precursor protein , cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1b  , transcription factor 7-like  <dig>  t-cell specific, hmg-box  were most prominent .

the reaction to stress on the transcriptome level differs between mouse strains and displays phases
to gain more insight into the potential functions of the regulated genes, each set of regulated genes was sorted according to their ontology. genes coding for mitochondrial, biosynthetic and metabolic molecules, receptors, signal transduction molecules, transcription and mrna processing molecules, ion channels and ion transport molecules, vesicular transport molecules and cytoskeleton components are highly represented . while the proportion of receptors and signal transduction molecules decreased between  <dig> h and  <dig> h after stress, the proportion of mitochondrial, biosynthetic and metabolic proteins increased in both mouse strains.

these observations suggested that the main focus of expression regulation after stress is shifted over time. to further address the question of the durability of the gene expression changes, we compared the genes regulated at  <dig> h with those regulated at  <dig> h after stress for each mouse strain. surprisingly, the set of regulated genes completely changed from  <dig> h to  <dig> h after stress in both mouse strains . genes that responded to the stressor after  <dig> h showed normalized expression levels  after  <dig> h, while other genes showed up as regulated at that time . we also observed that the stress-induced changes of the pvn transcriptome were entirely different between c57bl/6j and dba/2j mice. interestingly though, a convergence was apparent  <dig> h after stress .

possible signalling pathways elicited after forced swimming in the pvn
the observation that the percentage of receptors and signalling molecules among the regulated genes decreased from  <dig> h to  <dig> h after stress , together with the phased reaction of the transcriptome to stress , led us to hypothesise that genes regulated at  <dig> h have pathway connections to genes regulated at  <dig> h. employing a pathway building program to test this hypothesis, we identified links between genes responding at  <dig> h and genes responding at  <dig> h. for example, gnai <dig>  found to be up-regulated  <dig> h after stress in dba/2j mice, is upstream of app, which is up-regulated  <dig> h after stress. additionally, nfatc <dig>  found to be up-regulated  <dig> h after stress, is upstream of heat shock protein  <dig>  hspaia , which increases  <dig> h after stress .

in c57bl/6j mice, p21-activated kinase  <dig> , down-regulated  <dig> h-after stress, inhibits the expression of 'expressed in non-metastatic cells  <dig> protein'  via regulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha . nme <dig>  in turn, is upstream of sprouty homolog  <dig> , which is regulated  <dig> h after stress. another connection between genes that are both regulated  <dig> h after stress is between gnao <dig> and rgs <dig> .

validation of gnai <dig> and app expression and regulation in the pvn
to validate and further analyse the expression changes of the genes gnai <dig> and app that are linked by a pathway in the pvn of dba/2j mice, we used real-time pcr. rna samples from the original punctures were amplified  and subjected to rt-pcr without pooling. the results confirmed the up-regulation of gnai <dig>  <dig> h after stress  detected by the microarray . to test whether this regulation is specific for dba/2j mice, or may also occur in c57bl/6j mice , we also tested the respective samples from c57bl/6j mice. the results showed a non-significant increase in this mouse strain, implying that the regulation is rather strain-specific .

similarly to gnai <dig>  we validated the expression and regulation of app  <dig> h after forced swimming by real-time pcr , which was found in the microarray analysis.

to visualize the regulation of this expression with spatial resolution in the pvn, in situ hybridization was performed on coronal brain-sections, followed by semi-quantification of the mrna signal. the results showed a strong signal in the pvn area  and the analysis confirmed again the up-regulation to a level of  <dig>  fold . in situ hybridization showed also specific expression of app in the pvn .

finally, to test whether stress-regulation of gnai <dig> and app is specific to the pvn, we also analysed the hypothalamic region just anterior and posterior to the pvn. the results show no significant change in the expression levels of gnai <dig> and app for the respective time point .

clustering analysis of gnai <dig> - app
having corroborated a potential role of the gnai <dig> - app connection in stress response of dba mice, we used clustering analysis to identify genes that display similar expression changes throughout the conditions we analysed. in setting up the clustering analysis, we considered both up- and down-regulation, because some transcriptional regulators, such as gr, are able to both up- and down-regulate genes. genes identified in a clustering analysis may be under a common transcriptional control, or influencing each other.

the dendrograms revealed  <dig> and  <dig> genes for gnai <dig>  and  <dig> for app . several genes with known function were among these nearest neighbours.

to test potential, already described connections between these genes, we again used a pathway building program. interestingly, we found that gnai <dig> is located in a signalling cascade, where 'heart and neural crest derivatives expressed transcript 2'  is upstream, app is downstream and map3k <dig> further downstream. dhdds and gnai <dig> share a common upstream regulator  as well as a common downstream target . gnai <dig> and cops <dig> have a common target as well. in addition, gnai <dig> and app are found both downstream of another common regulator . furthermore, for app we identified common upstream regulators with papola , en <dig> as its regulator and hsd17b <dig> as its target. interestingly, dgkz and app are linked in a feedback loop . thus, the clustering analysis revealed functionally related genes, indeed.

discussion
the pvn of the hypothalamus is pivotal in governing physiological stress response. we examined the impact of forced swimming as an acute stressor on gene expression in the pvn of c57bl/ <dig> and dba/2j mice. these inbred mouse strains have been used as a genetic animal model of depression-like behaviour and are characterized by a different stress-responsiveness, since dba/2j mice display a stronger behavioural response to stressful conditions  <cit> . we discovered that the stress-regulated genes code mainly for receptors and signal transduction molecules, as well as numerous biosynthetic molecules. this result is consistent with a previous study of gene expression profiling in the hypothalamus of mice stressed by immobilization, where genes involved in energy and lipid metabolism, apoptosis, signal transduction, dna repair, protein biosynthesis, and structure integrity-related genes were found. however, this study referred to the entire hypothalamus and the number of genes studied was comparatively small   <cit> , while in our study approximately  <dig> gene transcripts have been studied. in addition, one should keep in mind that categorically distinct acute stressors elicit distinct transcriptional profiles in the pvn  <cit> . nevertheless, a few genes were found in both studies, for example atp synthase, h+ transporting mitochondrial f <dig> complex and ribosomal protein l <dig>  <cit> .

in principle, all genes that we found differentially expressed or differentially regulated between the two mouse strains are candidates for the explanation of the differential response to some stressors, reflecting the previously proposed differences in corticosteroid signalling  <cit> . in addition, we checked genes with known functions that could contribute to the strain differences such as pomc <dig> , gr , crhr <dig> and crhr <dig> . only gr showed differential regulation, namely a down-regulation in dba/2j mice  <dig> h after stress. causality is difficult to prove in feedback systems such as the hpa axis, i.e. when considering the complex connections of compensatory mechanisms that emerged in this evolutionarily old threat response system  <cit> . nevertheless, this difference could be indicative of differential stress signalling, as gr is the most important mediator of corticosteroid action.

since dba/2j mice also exhibit a higher sensitivity to antidepressants than c57bl/ <dig>  <cit>  we also specifically investigated genes that had been associated with antidepressant response before, such as the immunophilin fkbp <dig>  <cit> , which is an efficient regulator of gr  <cit> , the multidrug resistance protein abcb1a/b that determines brain tissue penetration of many antidepressant drugs  <cit> , the serotonin receptor  <dig> ht2a, and the transporter proteins slc6a <dig> and slc6a <dig>   <cit> . among those, slc6a <dig> was down-regulated  <dig> h after stress in dba/2j mice, but not in c57bl/ <dig> mice. since stress and gr action is intertwined with the action of antidepressants  <cit> , also any of the stress-induced genes could contribute to the action of antidepressants. like with other screening studies, it is certainly premature to delineate direct candidates for novel antidepressant targets or for diagnostic markers from this study. however, the synopsis of our results together with results from different screening efforts in genetics  <cit> , proteomics, metabolomics etc., will yield convergence and thus allow selection of the most promising candidates.

our study provides strong evidence for a time-phased response of the pvn transcriptome to the stressor. we have previously described a phased stress response for the ca <dig> hippocampal region as well  <cit> . this suggests that this might be not an area-specific phenomenon, but rather a more general mechanism. interestingly, a number of genes are regulated by stress in the hippocampal ca <dig> as well as in the pvn, e.g. dpysl <dig>  snap <dig>  gnao <dig>  <cit> . like for the stress-regulated genes in ca <dig>  we used also for the regulated genes in the pvn a pathway building program to propose novel signal transduction pathways elicited after stress. this pathway analysis revealed an interesting link between gnai <dig> and app whose stress regulation we validated by real time qpcr.

gnai <dig>  that displayed increased expression after stress, is a plasma membrane protein and a member of the g proteins that inhibit adenylate cyclase. many important hormones and neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, dopamine and serotonin, use the g pathway to evoke physiological responses  <cit> . in addition to inhibiting adenylate cyclase, g regulates c-src  and rap <dig> pathways, for example. this well studied inhibition may be physiologically relevant, in particular in inhibiting the effects of camp to modulate secretion in response to beta-adrenergic stimuli  <cit> . despite their established role in modulating cellular processes, very little is known regarding molecular mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of any g-protein. it has been reported previously, that the increase of reactive oxygen species in k <dig> cells up-regulates galpha  <cit> . here we report an increase of gnai <dig> in dba/2j mice  <dig> h after stress, which reveals a more direct impact of stress on gnai <dig> expression by psychological stressors not reported so far.

similarly to gnai <dig>  we were able to identify an increase of app mrna in the pvn of dba/2j mice,  <dig> h after exposure to forced swimming. app is mostly known for being the source of the toxic amyloid-β  peptide found in neuritic plaques of alzheimer's disease  patients. however, it may in addition be a functionally important molecule in its full-length configuration, as well as be the source of numerous fragments with varying effects on neural function  <cit> . besides its cellular function  throughout the body, it is also reported to participate in a number of important functions in the cns, i.e. neuronal development, survival and plasticity  <cit>  and to be a central molecule in many metabolic and regulatory pathways, so that its regulation may impact on a network of genes  <cit> . moreover, there is a growing body of evidence that app may be part of the cellular response to stress, and serve neurotrophic and neuroprotective functions  <cit> , although the neuroprotective role of app remains controversial.

our observed up-regulation of app is in line with the rapid increase in amyloid precursor protein immunoreactivity in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei described in the rat hypothalamus after osmotic stress  <cit> . furthermore, exposure of wild-type animals to an enriched environment can up-regulate app-expression  <cit> , although it remains unclear whether full-length app or one of its fragments are involved since app has been reported to exert beneficial effects for neurons  <cit> , the increase after stress might be important as a protective mechanism for the sensitive pvn area.

linked to the action of app, we also observed a regulation of the α-secretase adam <dig>  <dig> h after stress. upon neuronal over-expression in a mouse model for alzheimer's disease, this protease has been shown to increase the secretion of sappα, reduce the formation of aβ peptides and prevent their deposition in plaques as well as to alleviate impaired long-term potentiation and cognitive deficits  <cit> . in the stress exposed mice investigated here, there was pronounced strain specificity, i.e.  <dig> h after stress adam <dig> was strongly down-regulated in c57bl/6j mice , but up-regulated in dba/2j mice . of note, the inhibition of adenyl cyclase, from gnai <dig> could also lead to the non amyloidogenic a-secretase pathway, resulting elevated sappα by likely shifting to the protein kinase competing signalling pathway. moreover, this increase of gnai <dig> after stress appears also to be strain-specific, because it was found in dba/j <dig>  but not in c57bl/6j mice  <cit> . the hypothesis emerging from these observations, i.e. a role of sappα in differentially shaping stress response needs to be tested by further experiments, for example by more directly manipulating the gnai <dig> signalling pathway, adam <dig> expression and the activity and app or its metabolite sappα, in vitro and possibly also in vivo. these studies could include stress-exposure and antidepressant response in app transgenic and/or app knockout mice.

the clustering analysis we have performed and the pathway analysis that followed turned out to be very useful tools and revealed new possible signalling pathways involving gnai <dig> and app. obviously, mechanisms in addition to gene expression, such as protein phosphorylation, protein-protein binding etc. also operate in regulatory networks. nevertheless, we believe that the identified network adds significantly towards the understanding of the complicated mechanisms of the response of the pvn to stress. moreover, we propose that the combination of our results with future results expected from research efforts targeted towards proteins, gene polymorphisms, epigenomes, metabolome etc. will help identifying markers for diagnosis, stratification of subjects, and possibly also novel drug targets.

CONCLUSIONS
given the importance of pvn hypothalamic area for the physiological stress response and the discussed neuroprotective role of app, the up-regulation of gnai <dig> and app mrna levels after a mild stress in mice is suggested as it could be an adaptational stress-response in stress-responsive mice. novel molecular pathways involving stress regulated genes that respond to stress in the pvn area, have been revealed based on clustering and signalling cascade pathway analysis.
