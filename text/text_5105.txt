BACKGROUND
the h5n <dig> strain of avian influenza virus has been circulating in different countries since its first detection in china in  <dig> causing severe damages to the fowl industry in some regions. in europe, it was first detected during fall of  <dig> in croatia and romania, according to the world organisation for animal health . during  <dig>  it was reported from an important number of countries including germany, denmark, france, greece, italy, sweden and czech republic where it was involved in severe mortality in domestic poultry, and/or in different species of wildlife. in spite of the iberian peninsula being an important area in migratory routes and holding at given moments around  <dig>  migratory birds, no case of h5n <dig> infection had been ever detected. here we report the first confirmation of the presence of this viral strain in a great crested grebe  found dead in a pond near vitoria in the basque country on the north of spain, as well as the results of generic influenza type a testing in the basque country.

RESULTS
a grebe reportedly found dead in salburua pond and registered in the laboratory on 30th june  <dig>  tested positive  in a screening step with influenza a type matrix gene real time reverse transcription pcr  using the primers described by spackman and others  <dig>  <cit> . then it was submitted to the h <dig> and h <dig> specific rrt-pcr  <cit>  which came out positive at  <dig> ct and negative respectively. a h5n <dig> commercial conventional multiplex rt-pcr was run  that yielded also a positive result for h <dig> and for n <dig> 

at the same time five embryonated specific pathogen free  eggs of 9– <dig> days of incubation were inoculated with a swab following the oie recommendations  <cit> . at  <dig> h postinoculation four embryos out of five died and only the allantoic fluid of the surviving egg was positive to slide and plate erythrocyte hemagglutination . after that, the positive allantoic fluid was tested for hemagglutination inhibition  to determine the ha subtype  <cit> . the hi results of the allantoic fluid were negative for h <dig> and positive at 1/ <dig> to 1/ <dig> dilutions for h <dig>  at 24– <dig> h postinoculation of a second and third passage of the surviving embryo, the allantoic fluids were collected and tested for ha and hi, and all of them were positive with h <dig> reference positive serum. also, the five spf eggs allantoic fluids of the first passage were submitted to conventional rt-pcr a type  <cit>  and h <dig> subtype  that yielded positive results in all cases.

the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase pcr products were sequenced  <cit>  and the partial sequences deposited in genbank . its high pathogenicity was first determined by a conventional pcr based in the protocol described by payungporn and others in  <dig>  <cit> , and after that by the study of the sequence of the cleavage site  that characterised this strain as of highly pathogenic.

the sequences obtained were compared with those already available in genbank database by nucleotide sequence homology searches made at the network server of the national center for biotechnology information  using blast. multiple sequence alignments were performed using the program alignx  with an engine based on the clustalw algorithm  <cit> . finally sequences extending from nucleotide  <dig> to  <dig> of the ha gene  and from nucleotide  <dig> to  <dig> of the na gene  were included in the analysis. similarity matrices were then constructed from aligned sequence data by the kimura's two-parameter model  <cit> . phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbour joining method  <cit>  as implemented in the mega  <dig> package  <cit>  . stability or accuracy of inferred topologies were assessed via bootstrap analysis of  <dig> replicates.

these phylogenetic analyses showed that the great crested grebe virus isolated in the basque country belongs to the asian h5n <dig> hpai virus lineage. the closest relatives are viruses found in italy, czech republic and bavaria in  <dig> 

a sample was also sent to the spanish national reference laboratory  for official confirmation.

regarding the survey for generic influenza type a virus, we have obtained positive results in about 8% of all wild bird samples examined. none of them were positive in the h <dig> or h <dig> rrt-pcr excluding the great crested grebe case. currently we are sequencing these positive samples in order to determine influenza virus subtype .

the results of our investigation as confirmed by the snrl have been officially registered by oie as the first cases of the h5n <dig> avian influenza subtype in the iberian peninsula. it is very striking that it has first been detected in the basque autonomous community which according to spanish ministry of agriculture, fisheries and food data holds only 3% of the migratory birds in spain and has processed less than 4%  of the samples examined in the whole country. great crested grebe are regarded as sedentary in the basque autonomous community with  <dig> breeding pairs and  <dig> wintering birds registered in  <dig> census  <cit> .

our results on type a influenza virus prevalence in wild birds are in agreement with estimates from some authors  <cit> . however, they seem to disagree with others  <cit>  in the sense that we have found around ten times more positives than those reported.

all these disagreements are difficult to explain and require a closer study. one possible explanation is that our extraction method has a higher sensitivity to detect low levels of virus as we use a larger fraction of the total amount of available sample than other protocols  <cit> . other reasons that might contribute are poor sample preservation and transport imposed by the larger dispersion and distances of sampling locations with respect to the laboratory processing the samples, and less likely, absence of this virus in the larger wetlands in central and south spain.

in relation as to how this great crested grebe became infected the most likely hypothesis is contact with subclinical anatid carriers as wild ducks have demonstrated that they can excrete virus without showing clinical signs.  <cit> . on the other hand, it could be possible that the grebe became infected in another european country and after that arrived to salburua pond to feather moult, where it died. some water birds undergo a moult migration moving to sites where they are lower risk of predation and have food enough. such movements generally occur between late june and august with timing variations attending species and region  <cit> . another unlikely alternative is arrival through commercial duck imports since an unconfirmed h <dig> result was reported a few months before in a neighbouring region  <cit> .

anyway, it is worth to point that according to european union annual reports , this case, which seems to be the most south-westerly case in europe, could represent a change of host species and seasonality, since it was one of the first cases in a grebe that was followed in  <dig> by  <dig> cases  all throughout europe in summer. up to then the most affected species were swans  and the predominant season winter.

on the other hand the criteria of considering the generic matrix rrt-pcr as a screening on whose results decide whether or not to submit the samples to further more specific testing needs to be reviewed, as some laboratories only accept positive results under ct  <dig>  <cit>  and can also contribute to overlooking earlier cases of h5n <dig> infection in wild birds.

we think that surveillance needs to be increased and the methods reviewed. lack of striking increases in mortality supports the hypothesis that the virus is widely spread among subclinical carriers probably of the anatidae family and that only sporadically it reaches more susceptible species where some mortality occurs. for wild birds, given its over-dispersion and lack of close contact, these cases are probably rare and self-limiting. if the virus happens to reach a domestic bird's farm, the spread will be massive and will cause high mortality. lack of such episodes in spain indicates that farms have enough biosecurity measures in place, although there were no commercial farms in the  <dig> km protection area or the  <dig> km surveillance area around where this case was detected. the biggest risk of human infection seems to be highly limited not to wild birds' infection, but to domestic large outbreaks and in situations of animal-human very close contact and probably also high humidity and other host predisposing factors.

CONCLUSIONS
we think that the self-limiting nature of our finding and others proves that certain regions have ecological, geographical and climatological features that make it difficult for the h5n <dig> virus to spread  <cit>  and cause disease at least in the large scale scenario that has been worrying human and animal health authorities during the last years.
