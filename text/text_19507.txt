BACKGROUND
ochratoxin a  is an ubiquitous mycotoxin produced by several species of aspergillus and penicillium <cit> . humans are chronically and continuously exposed to ota because of its widespread existence in cereals , beans, dried fruits, tea, coffee, cocoa, wine, beer, herbs, poultry, fish, pork, eggs, cheese and milk  <cit> . when consuming in excess, ota is known to exert a diverse range of toxicological effects including nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, teratogenicity, mutagenicity, neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity  <cit> .

it has been shown that mitogen-activated protein kinase  signaling pathway plays an important role in mediating ota toxicity in vivo and in vitro. mapk activation is proved to induce renal carcinoma in rats chronically fed with ota  <cit> . although the link between mapk signaling pathway and ota toxicity has been studied, the key mirnas involved in the nephrotoxicity are unknown. understanding the linkage between mirnas and ota nephrotoxicity is crucial to fill the knowledge gap.

mirnas are short non-coding rnas that typically regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level by binding to partially complementary sites of their target mrnas. a mirna can regulate hundreds of mrnas and impact on crucial biological processes, including cell growth, apoptosis, development and differentiation  <cit> . moreover, various mirnas have been established to play important roles in the development of renal carcinoma .

the mechanism of mirna biogenesis has become clear. the majority of primary mirnas  transcripts are generated by rna polymerase ii. pri-mirnas are then cleaved into precursor mirnas  by microprocessor and subsequently exported to the cytoplasm by exportin  <dig> . the microprocessors contain drosha, a nuclear protein, and its cofactor, the digeorge syndrome critical region gene  <dig> protein , and play a pivotal role in recognizing and trimming pre-mirnas. pre-mirnas are further cleaved into single-stranded mature mirnas by one of the rnase iii family enzymes – dicer. mature mirnas are then transferred to the rna-induced silencing complex  to mediate the degradation and/or translational inhibition of their target rna sequences  <cit> . furthermore, the stability of mirna biogenesis is crucial for maintaining the cellular homeostasis. impaired mirna processing has been found in various tumors , suggesting a strong connection between mirna processing and cancer.

the objective of this study is to analyze mirna profiling in the kidneys of rats gavaged with ota. the results showed that mirna biogenesis were impaired and that the expression profiles of several mirnas were altered in association with ota nephrotoxicity.

RESULTS
body and organ weights
mean body weights were slightly reduced at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  weeks after administration of ota at 210 μg/kg . kidney weights were significently  reduced 4– <dig> weeks after ota administration . liver weights were increased after ota administration  at week  <dig> and decreased  at week  <dig>  ota administration did not impact on spleen and testis weights.figure  <dig>

serum clinical chemistry and histopathology
the blood clinical chemistry was not affected by ota doses or administration time. blood urea nitrogen and creatinine , common indexes of kidney damage, did not reflect the nephrotoxicity induced by ota. interestingly, aspartate transaminase  level was higher in the high dose than that in the mid dose group at four weeks, but was lower in the high dose than that in the control group at 13 weeks. the same is true for high-density lipoprotein  and lactate dehydrogenase  .table  <dig>

data are presented as mean ± sd of six rats per group. a: p <  <dig>  when compared to  <dig> μg/kg b.w. group; b: p <  <dig>  when compared to  <dig> μg/kg body weight group.



in the rats administrated of ota for  <dig> and 26 weeks, cytoplasmic vacuolization was observed in the outer stripe of outer medulla  in both 70 μg/kg and 210 μg/kg groups. karyomegaly  was prominent in tubular epithelium and the severity was ota dose- and time-dependent. the structure of tubular epithelium in the rats gavaged with ota at a dose of 210 μg/kg for 26 weeks was severely damaged. histopathology of the kidneys in the rats treated with ota for  <dig> and 4 weeks were generally indistinguishable. renal lesions were not found in the vehicle control rats .figure  <dig> 
h & e stained kidney sections of a control rat  and of rats treated with  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/kg b.w. ota for 13 weeks. at  <dig> and 210 μg/kg b.w., ota induced severe cytoplasmic vacuolization  and karyomegaly  in proximal tubular epithelial cells in outer stripe of outer medulla .



in summary, we found distinguishable  but not severe  histopathological damage in groups of 13 weeks. because thirteen-week was a turning point where ota started to show its nephrotoxicity, this time point was selected for the study of ota nephrotoxicity and mirna profiling and analysis in the kidneys.

mirna profiling
we used a, b, c and d to denote the groups of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 26 weeks, respectively. k , m  and h  represent  <dig>   <dig> and 210 μg/kg groups, respectively. total rna was pooled from rats in each group and thus three datasets with a total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> reads were obtained from ck, cm and ch, respectively. clean reads  were retained for further analysis after removing the adapters, low quality reads and small sequences  . analyses of small rna length distribution  indicated that the three samples peaked at the size of 22 nt, suggesting the homogeneity of the samples. ck and ch were almost superimposed. next, clean reads were compared with the rfam database  to match with the known rrna, snrna, snorna and trnasequences . after these non-coding rnas  were removed, the remaining clean reads were further compared with the pre-mirnas database in mirbase. the matched reads were used to identify mature mirnas, and the number of their reads were accounted. the reads that did not yield a match were used to predict novel mirnas using mireap. the numbers of mirna reads were normalized by tags per million  values  × 106) to express mirnas in ck, cm, ch comaprable in one table.table  <dig>

novel mirna analysis
a number of criterions were used for evaluating whether a small rna was a genuine mirna, such as formation of a stable hairpin structure, lower minimal free energies for hairpin structure of its precursors, and detection of mirna*s  <cit> . given these analyses,  <dig> novel mirnas were identified and examined by pcr .figure  <dig> 
the validation of  <dig> identified novel mirnas in the kidney by pcr. the two left lanes indicated mirnas and the right depicts the negative control.



impairment of mirna processing
a total of  <dig> known mirnas were found in ck, cm, and ch kidneys,  <dig> of which were differentially  expressed among the three groups . we further mapped the distribution of the mirna length , which was consistent with the pattern shown in figure 3a. total mirnas in cm was slightly lower than those in ch and ck . results from hierachical clustering analysis depicted that mirna expression was similar between ck and ch, and they were different from cm kidneys . therefore, differences of the expression pattern in the three groups are likely due to the impairment of mirna processing after ota nephrotoxicity.figure  <dig>

to further understand the nature of the defective mirna processing after ota toxicity, we determined the expression of key regulators of mirna processing: drosha, dicer <dig> and drcg <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  mrna levels of drosha and dicer <dig>  but not drcg <dig>  were significantly reduced after ota administrtaion.figure  <dig>

analysis of known mirna expression pattern
expression pattern of all known mirnas was examined by using stem software. two significant profiles  containing  <dig> mirnas were identified . expression of these  <dig> mirnas in both profiles were repressed in cm and reversed in ch kidneys. among these  <dig> mirnas, those with ≥ 2-fold down-regulation in cm compared to ck  were selected for bioinformatic analysis.figure  <dig> 
the expression pattern of mirnas in response to various doses of ota. two significant profiles  out of  <dig> profiles were detected as significant using stem analysis. red lines represent individual mirna whose expression correlates with ota doses. black curve represents the model of the profile to which the mirna expression pattern are similar. the numbers in the upper and lower left corners are the identifier  of the profile and the number of mirnas in a that profile.



the information on the putative target genes of these  <dig> mirnas were collected using the comparative platform of mirwalk  <cit>  by considering six different algorithms, including miranda, mirdb, mirwalk, pita, targetscan and rnahybrid. demanding a target gene to be predicted by different mirna-target prediction algorithms can be helpful in minimizing the number of putative and maybe false positive targets . therefore, the targets predicted with at least  <dig> different programs were considered for further analysis. both separative and collective kegg/go enrichment analysis were performed. in separative analysis, the predicted target genes were subjected to kegg/go enrichment analysis individually, following by a multiple testing method  to select for significantly  over-represented kegg pathways and gobps . in collective analysis, the identified targets were merged into one list, and non-redundant genes were removed followed to carry out kegg/go enrichment analysis . “phosphatidylinositol signaling system”, “pancreatic cancer” and “mapk signaling pathway” were greatly enriched as evidenced by both separative and collective analyses. notably, regulation of the pathways and gobps were strongly associated with mir- <dig>  mir-130a and mir-130b. no relevant pathways and gobps were found to be regulated by mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  which might be explained by the less putative targets prediction of the two mirnas.table  <dig>

putative target mrnas of  <dig> mirnas were predicted as previously mentioned . thereafter, separative and collective kegg/gobps analyses were accomplished as a result of meta-analysis predictions . in separative analysis, seventy-eight pathways were enriched in the “ <dig> up-regulated” and ninety-three were enriched in the “ <dig> down-regulated” mirnas, while  <dig> and  <dig> gobps were enriched in the “ <dig> up-regulated” and “ <dig> down-regulated” mirnas, respectively . venn diagrams were constructed to determine the common pathways . interestingly, the majority of the  <dig> pathways were overlapped between the “ <dig> up-regulated” and “ <dig> down-regulated” mirnas. similarly, a total of  <dig> gobps were commonly identified between the two groups of mirnas.figure  <dig>

twenty-five mirnas that were deregulated in the cm group  were also subjected to kegg/go enrichment analysis . mir- <dig> was not found in the selected database. in separative analysis,  <dig> and  <dig> pathways and  <dig> and  <dig> gobps were over-represented in the “ <dig> up-regulated” and “ <dig> down-regulated” mirnas, respectively. moreover, extensive overlaps were noted between pathways and gobps . the target genes involved in these pathways or gobps were given in additional file 1: tables s <dig> a-d.

we tested the gene expression of nrf <dig> and its negative regulator, keap <dig>  nrf <dig> mrna level in the kidney was significantly decreased  after ota treatment , and the expression of keap <dig> was significantly increased by ota treatment .figure  <dig>

among the six mirnas that selected by stem analysis,  <dig> mirnas  were analyzed by qrt-pcr to validate the results of high throughput sequencing data. in agreement with sequencing data, mir- <dig>  mir-130b and mir- <dig> were down-regulated in cm and up-regulated in ch, although no signicance was found in mir- <dig>  no change was found in mir-130b according to qrt-pcr .figure  <dig>

the expression of mir- <dig>  mir-130a, mir-130b and mir- <dig> was also examined in kidneys of rats in groups of 4 weeks and 26 weeks. both of mir-130b and mir- <dig> were up-regulated after administrated with ota for 4 weeks . in the 26-week group, the expression of mir- <dig> and mir-130b were decreased, while mir- <dig> was increased . there was no significant effect of ota on the expression of mir-130a. primers used in the qrt-pcr were listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>

dcn mrna, a target gene of mir- <dig>  encodes a protein that regulates cell cycle. furthermore, a surfeit in dcn expression exists in diabetic renal damage. dcn mrna levels in the kidney of streptozotocin-induced diabetes in mice are rapidly elevated following the induction of diabetes  <cit> . sepp <dig>  a target of mir- <dig>  is a major extracellular selenoprotein that is synthesized and secreted from the kidneys and plays critical roles in body selenium homeostasis.

discussion
the integrity of mirna processing machanism plays a pivotal role in homeostasis and the regulation of various diseases. origins of various forms of cancer including ovarian, lung, gastric and breast are accompanied with decreased expression of dicer and drosha. moreover, abrogation of drosha, drcg <dig> or dicer substantially increases the possibility of cellular transformation and tumorigenesis  <cit> . the observation that drosha  and dicer <dig>  were down-regulated in the kidneys of rats after ota administration suggests that dysregulation of mirna processing may attribute to ota nephrotoxicity and renal carcinogenesis.

how mirna processing might be associated with ota-induced renal toxicity and carcinogenesis? it is known that dicer can stimulate p-akt, pcna <cit>  and c-myc <cit>  expression, which is associated with the enhanced proliferation and invasion in tumor cells. on the other hand, akt <dig>  c-myc <cit>  and pcna <cit> , proteins associated with cell survival and proliferation, are up-regulated in the kidney after ota exposure. this suggests that dicer might mediate the carcinogenicity of ota by regulating akt, c-myc and pcna. dicer is also required for the maturation of short interfering rnas   <cit> , which specifically degrade their target mrnas. thus, ota-induced down-regulation of dicer might also disturb the rna interfering  system. decreased expression of dicer  and drosha  in kidneys may position the ota-gavaged rats at an extremely complex toxicological response, which might include the inhibition of both mirna and sirna. drcg <dig> is the only known protein that is specific to the mirna processing pathway  <cit> . because the expression of drcg <dig> is not affected by ota administration, we speculate that an organism or a cell could initiate other regulatory pathways for the maturation or compensation of endogenous mirnas, when down-regulation of global expression of mirnas occurs due to a severe impairment in the classical mirna processing pathway. thus, further investigations are needed to better understand ota-induced inhibitory mechanism of mirna biogenesis.

results from hierachical clustering analyses demonstrate that ck and ch groups are closer in euclidean distance. interestingly, hierachical clustering analysis of the gene expression in rats fed with ota for less than 12 months indicates that a cluster was noted between the early  and the late responses   <cit> . these results suggest that ota may mediate nephrotoxicity in an age-dependent manner. the hierachical clusterings, small rna and mirna length distribution pattern suggest that a series of signaling pathways are affected and orchestrated at the early response to ota toxicity and that the transition period might be of paramount importance in the regulation of nephrotoxicity.

based on the expression pattern, mirna expression was decreased in cm and increased in ch, which was consistent with results from our hierachical clusterings. kegg and go enrichment analyses were further performed in the six differentially expressed mirnas , demonstrating that “phosphatidylinositol signaling system”, “pancreatic cancer” and “mapk signaling pathway” were mostly significantly enriched. specifically, several previous studies addressed the involvement of mapk pathway in the development of ota-induced toxicity  <cit> . after the male rats were fed with ota at a concentration of 300 μg/kg for 12 months, the kidneys were used to analyse key players in the mapk pathway  <cit> . ota administration induces the phosphorylation of pkcζ. one of its selective downstream target, erk 1/ <dig>  was markedly increased at day  <dig>  the upstream mediator of pkc phosphorylation, pkd, is also activated by phosphoprotein at day  <dig>  substrates of erk 1/ <dig>  elk 1/ <dig> and p90rsk are also significantly activated at days  <dig> and  <dig>  the expression of insulin-like growth factor  <dig> receptor , an upstream molecule of pdk <dig>  is increased at day  <dig> and  <dig>  followed by a decline after 12 months of treatment. the aforementioned signals typically lead to cell proliferation. analyses of the mapk pathway have helped to confirm that this pathway is critical in the kidneys of rats after ota administration. after a long-term gavaging, mapk pathway tends to be progressively repressed. nonetheless, further transcriptomic and proteomic analyses are needed to provide a full spectrum of the ota-induced gene expression changes.

interestingly, our results showed that ota induced up-expression of mir-130b in the  <dig> and 13 weeks groups, then a down-expression in the 26 weeks groups, indicating the different effect of ota on mir-130b between the short- and long-term treatment.

overexpression of mir-133b in hela cells increases tumor necrosis factor-α-induced cell death  <cit> . coincidently, ota exacerbates renal cell proliferation, extending from the medullary rays into the osom in a dose- and time-dependent manner  <cit> . down-regulation of mir-133b in the ch group implies an undermined programmed cell death mechanism in the kidney and offers a possible explanation of renal cell proliferation stimulated by ota. transgelin  <dig> , an inhibitior of cell proliferation in renal carcinoma , is an intriguing target of mir-133a. tagln <dig> is recognized as an oncogene and diminished expression of mir-133a is frequently shown in rcc  <cit> . similar result is shown in bladder cancer cell lines  <cit> . moreover, mir-133b reduces the expression of glutathione-s-transferase pi , one of the phase ii enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism. after throughly scrutinizing a transcriptomics result from kidneys of rats after 2 years of daily dietary intake of ota, we have previously shown that expression of gstp  is impaired  <cit> . this reveals a possible linkage between mir-133b and gstp in mediating ota toxicity.

ota increases mir- <dig> and mir-200c expression in porcine renal proximal tubular cells  <cit> . the induction of these two mirnas may attenuate the expression of nrf <dig> and ho- <dig>  resulting in the elevation of ros level and the expression of the profibrotic tgfβ. future in vivo studies are needed to verify the link between nrf <dig> and mirna following ota toxicology.

keap <dig> is a negative regulator of nrf <dig> <cit> . we have herein found that nrf <dig> expression was significantly decreased as ota doses increased. a previous study has demonstrated that ota induces the disruption of nrf <dig> expression and its corresponding downstream proteins  <cit> . this has been proved to be associated with an inhibition of nrf <dig> binding to the antioxidant responsive element at the promoter region in vitro <cit> . according to our results, down-regulation of nrf <dig> might be due to the elevated keap <dig> expression. however, since ota treatment induces mirna- <dig>  a regulator of keap <dig> <cit> , in  <dig> and 26 weeks after ota adminstration, it seems impossible that an elevation in the expression of keap <dig> is due to down-regulation of mirna- <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
a high-throughput sequencing approach has been used to explore the differentially expressed mirnas in the kidneys of rats in response to different doses of ota. mapk signaling pathway may play a vital role in mediating ota toxicity. kegg and go enrichment analyses have been performed and the results are consistent with the previous ota studies. most importantly, we have shown herein that the mirna processing machanism is severely hampered by ota treatment. the differentially expressed mirnas after ota administration have been analyzed and validated, most of which are in agreement with the sequencing results. these findings provide the first and valuable information for exploring the toxicological mechanism of ota in the perspective of mirnas.
