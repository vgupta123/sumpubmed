BACKGROUND
myxomycetes  are eukaryotic microorganisms that according to olive  <cit>  represent one of four main groups of slime molds . the myxomycetes consist of about  <dig> assigned species classified into five orders   <cit> . a typical myxomycete species has a complex sexual life cycle that consists of two vegetative stages; a haploid unicellular stage  and a diploid syncytium stage , as well as several dormant and developmental stages  <cit> . myxomycetes are commonly found in nature on decaying plant materials where they feed on a variety of bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes as well as dissolved plant nutrients  <cit> . identification of species is mainly based on morphological characters including fruiting body structures and sporocarp colors, and lime deposition  <cit> . more recently, nuclear dna sequence markers have contributed in resolving relationships among and within taxonomic groups. the ribosomal dna  spacers  <cit> , obligatory group i introns  <cit> , ribosomal rna  genes  <cit> , and the elongation factor-1α  gene  <cit>  and have all been applied.

the order physarales is of special interest since it contains the two best-studied myxomycete species at the biochemical and molecular levels   <cit> . one unusual feature among the physarales is the linear multicopy nature of the nuclear rdna minichromosome, which ranges in size from about  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb among species  <cit> . whereas the rdna minichromosome in d. iridis is only  <dig> kb and contains a single pre-rrna transcription unit, a 60-kb palindromic rdna with two transcription units has been characterized in p. polycephalum. a hallmark of physarales rdna minichromosomes is the presence of multiple group i introns within the rrna coding regions. all isolates investigated to date contain at least two group i introns in the large subunit  rrna gene, and high intron loads are exemplified in isolates of fuligo septica and diderma niveum which contain  <dig> and  <dig> intron insertions, respectively  <cit> , our unpublished results. group i introns code for ribozymes  that perform self-splicing by a common molecular mechanism based on a series of transesterification reactions  <cit> . a group i ribozyme is organized into a well-defined and highly conserved rna core structure that consists of three helical stacks referred to as the catalytic domain , the substrate domain , and the scaffold domain   <cit> .

here we report the presence of  <dig> rdna group i introns and molecular phylogeny of  <dig> physarales isolates  based on combined data sets of nuclear small subunit  and lsu rrna gene sequences. the analysis supports a polyphyletic origin of the physarum genus. phylogenetic analysis of physarales is of particular importance since two representative species are currently under whole genome and transcriptome analyses. whereas p. polycephalum is sequenced at the genome institute – washington university, our laboratory at university of tromsø investigates d. iridis by deep sequencing technologies. resolving relationships of genera or species within and between the two physarales families  are crucial in interpretations of comparative genome and transcriptome data.

RESULTS
high load of group i introns in myxomycete rdna
a characteristic feature of myxomycete rrna gene sequences is the high load of autocatalytic group i introns  <cit> . these introns have to be correctly identified by structural characterizations and removed from coding sequences prior to phylogenetic analysis. myxomycete group i introns have been found at  <dig> different, but highly conserved, insertion sites  <cit> , and several of the introns are diverse in sequence and highly complex in organization due to internal protein coding genes, large arrays of direct repeat motifs, and even additional catalytic rna domains  <cit> .

the rdna sequences included in this study  were examined for the presence of group i introns. we observed a massive intron contents . myxomycetes belonging to the order physarales  harbored the majority of intron insertions . here,  <dig> and  <dig> introns were recognized in  <dig> and  <dig> isolates of physaraceae and didymiaceae, respectively . interestingly, all physarales isolates investigated contained two obligatory group i introns at positions l <dig> and l <dig> in the lsu rrna gene. introns at these sites have been found to be strictly vertically inherited  <cit> , have probably gained an essential biological role in benefit for the host cell  <cit> , and possess highly complex structure and organization features at the rna and dna levels .


relationships among the mycetozoan rdna
according to olive  <cit>  the mycetozoans have been divided into four main groups of slime molds; the myxomycetes, dictyostelids, protostelids and acrasids. as an initial approach to investigate the relationships among the mycetozoans groups we performed molecular phylogeny based on unambiguously aligned ssu rrna genes sequences  from  <dig> defined species representing the four mycetozoan groups as well as various amoebozoans . these sequences were either retrieved directly from the sequence database  or generated in our laboratory by pcr amplification using specific primers followed by sanger sequence determination .

some significant findings are noted from the un-rooted maximum likelihood  tree . the dictyostelids and myxomycetes were both found to represent monophyletic groups supported by high bootstrap values for ml, maximum parsimony , neighbour joining , and bayesian inference  analyses. furthermore, each of the five main myxomycete orders  represented distinct groups within the plasmodial slime molds. these findings corroborate earlier studies on the phylogeny of slime molds  <cit> . finally, soliformovum irregulare  and acrasis rosea  appeared both distantly related from each other and from the dictyostelids and myxomycetes. from this analysis we conclude that the apparent phenotypic similarity between the mycetozoan groups  <cit>  is not reflected in the genetic relationship.

relationships within the didymiaceae
data presented in additional file 1: figure s <dig> and previous studies  <cit>  supported a monophyletic origin of the order physarales among the myxomycetes. to gain deeper insights in the relationships among families, genera, species and isolates within the order physarales we performed molecular phylogeny based on two different data sets of nuclear rrna gene sequences . the first data set represents an alignment of  <dig> nt positions consisting of a near complete ssu rrna gene in combination with a segment of the lsu rrna gene . the second data set consists of the lsu rrna gene segment only .

a representative ml tree based on the ssu/lsu data set is presented in figure  <dig>  the ml tree includes  <dig> isolates  of the didymiaceae family, and supported by nj/mp/ml > 64% and bay posterior probability >  <dig>  . the monophyly of the four genera  was supported by nj/mp/ml > 93% and bay posterior probability of  <dig>  . furthermore, phylogenetic analysis was performed on the lsu data set  generated from  <dig> didymiaceae isolates . a representative ml tree is presented in figure 3a. this analysis is in general agreement with that of the ssu/lsu data set, but with less statistical support at basal nodes of the didymium and diderma genera. however, the lepidoderma genus was strongly supported in both data sets . these findings corroborate more recent studies of didymiaceae relationships  <cit> , and we conclude that rdna-based phylogeny is well consistent with the current didymiaceae taxonomy  <cit> .

recent taxonomy updates recognize at least  <dig> and  <dig> species of physarum and badhamia, respectively  <cit> . myxomycete taxonomy has traditionally been based on morphological characteristics of sporocarps and fruiting bodies. however, it has been debated for decades what characters that unambiguously distinguish physarum and badhamia genera species  <cit> , and consequently some physarum species in the current taxonomy has previously been assigned to the badhamia genus and vice versa  <cit> . a similar relationship based on rrna gene sequence phylogeny involving one badhamia and two physarum isolates was recently noted, but not further commented  <cit> . our findings of a polyphyletic origin of the physarum genus, with at least three phylogenetic clades interspersed with badhamia isolates, strongly suggest a reevaluation of the current taxonomy to also include molecular data.

intron synapomorphy supports physarum clades
a different approach to validate the physarum clades is structural analysis of the obligatory group i introns present in the lsu rrna gene of all investigated physarales isolates . both l <dig> and l <dig> introns have strict vertical inheritance pattern within the physarales with potential as genetic markers  <cit> . we analyzed structural features of l <dig> introns at the rna level in more detail, and representative secondary structure diagrams of the catalytic core are presented in figure 4a-c. whereas the approximately 120-nt catalytic core was found conserved in sequence and structure, large extensions of various lengths were observed in all peripheral paired segment regions . an extreme case was noted in the l <dig> intron  in p. didermoides . here, direct repeat motifs were found both within the  <dig> nt p <dig> extension and the  <dig> nt p <dig> extension , and exemplifies the complex structural nature of myxomycete group i introns.

the most surprising structural feature, however, was found directly at the guanosine binding site  within the p <dig> segment. the g-binding site is at the catalytic center of a group i ribozyme, is highly conserved among all group i introns, and contains a universally conserved g:c pair adjacent to a bulged nucleotide . the g-binding site follows strong sequence co-variation rules, and if the bulged nucleotide is a c the first pair of the p <dig> segment is always an a:u or a u:a pair  <cit> . figure 4a presents structures of clade i introns  which have a u:a pair followed by a bulged c. clade ii introns  have a slightly different g-binding site of an a:u pair followed by a bulged c . a third g-binding site variant was noted in the clade iii introns . similar to clade ii introns, the clade iii introns have a a:u as the first p <dig> pair, but followed by a bulged u. the latter feature is highly unusual among group i introns and to our knowledge the physarum clade iii l <dig> introns are the only examples among the more than  <dig>  group i introns available in the sequence data base  <cit> . the fact that g-binding site variants appears to correlate with sequence-based phylogeny suggests that the intron structure character represents a synapomorphic character that further supports a complex origin of the physarum genus.

CONCLUSIONS
partial and complete rrna gene sequences have been obtained from a large number of myxomycete isolates and have proven to represent reliable phylogenetic markers. however, myxomycete rrna gene sequencing is challenged by an extreme high load of group i intron elements, and we report in our data sets  <dig> introns interrupting coding sequences in physarales isolates. several of the introns have complex organisations and were thus difficult to identify at sequence level. introns are typically located in highly conserved parts of the rrna genes that directly interfere with the design of universal primers and may result in sampling biases in analysis approaches. we observed congruence between phylogeny and current taxonomy of the didymiaceae isolates, but a different pattern was observed among the family physaraceae and includes a polyphyletic origin of the genus physarum. three well supported clades containing a mixture of physarum and badhamia isolates were noted, suggesting reevaluation of the current taxonomy into new genera. these observations were further supported by an unusual synapomorphic character at the g-binding site of the l <dig> group i introns.
