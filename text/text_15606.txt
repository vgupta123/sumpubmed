BACKGROUND
industrial activities and the application of fertilisers, pesticides and sewage sludge in agriculture have contributed to the dispersion of toxic metals, such as cadmium , in all ecosystem compartments worldwide  <cit> . growing on contaminated soils, plants can take up and accumulate cd through their root system and transport it to the aboveground plant parts  <cit> , <cit> . cadmium bioaccumulation ultimately leads to the introduction of cd into the food chain, eliciting threats to the public health, even when present at trace concentrations  <cit> - <cit> . consequently, the reorientation from agricultural to non-food crops is occurring in contaminated areas. these crops are selected for their metal resistance and accumulation capacity, with the final objective to stabilise and clean the soils in a process called phytoremediation  <cit> - <cit> .

cadmium is a highly phytotoxic, non-essential element that reduces plant growth and inhibits photosynthesis. cadmium-induced phytotoxicity is a result of cellular and molecular interactions such as:  inactivating and/or denaturing biomolecules by binding their functional groups,  replacing essential elements  showing chemical similarities and  increasing the production of reactive oxygen species , hereby affecting the cellular redox state  <cit> , <cit> - <cit> .

phytohormones are known to be affected by multifarious biotic and abiotic stress conditions  and play important roles as signal molecules, integrating developmental programs and responses to environmental stimuli  <cit> - <cit> . the gaseous hormone ethylene is involved in multiple molecular, biochemical and physiological processes during the entire life cycle of the plant and has also been related to enhanced ros accumulation  <cit> , <cit> . a relatively simple metabolic pathway controls the biosynthesis of ethylene  <cit> . methionine, the biological precursor of ethylene, is converted to s-adenosylmethionine  by sam synthetase. 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid  synthase  uses sam as a substrate to form acc. this is mostly the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of ethylene. acc is oxidised to ethylene by acc oxidase , with co <dig> and cyanide as by-products  <cit> - <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana, both acs and aco are encoded by multigene families, regulated at the transcriptional level by developmental as well as environmental signals  <cit> - <cit> . in addition, acs proteins can also be post-translationally modified , influencing their stability  <cit> .

ethylene is often considered as the ‘stress hormone’, modulating multiple defense responses to stresses such as wounding, hypoxia, drought and excess ozone or salt but for example also partially controlling mycorrhizal development and colonisation  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> - <cit> . it is known that an increasing ethylene production ensued by regular signal transduction can inhibit plant development and accelerate senescence and abscission processes  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . hence, a better understanding of the metal-induced effects on the ethylene biosynthesis pathway improves our knowledge on plant metal resistance, which can be implemented in future research concerning the phytoremediation of contaminated soils.

although the responses of ethylene production of plants to different toxic metals have already been investigated many times, the mechanistic basis remains unclear  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> - <cit> . it is indeed well known that the effect of exposure to metals on ethylene production is metal and concentration specific  <cit> . mertens et al.  <cit>  observed an increasing ethylene production in 7 days old arabidopsis thaliana plants exposed to  <dig> – 500 μm copper  and zinc  for up to 6 hours. lequeux et al.  <cit> , on the other hand, did not observe an effect on ethylene production in 9 days old arabidopsis thaliana plants exposed to 50 μm cu for 24 hours. in addition, groppa et al.  <cit>  reported that metal-induced effects on ethylene production are also species-specific. a 14 hours exposure to 1 mm of either cd or cu increased the ethylene production in 4 weeks old wheat leaves, whereas in sunflower leaves only cu enhanced the ethylene production. rodriguez-serrano et al.  <cit>  detected a higher ethylene production in 14 days old pea plants exposed to 50 μm cd for 14 days. exposure to 400 μm cd or cu, but not zn nor nickel , differently induced ethylene production in various plant parts of arabidopsis thaliana <cit> . the effect of these different metals on the ethylene release was also inversely proportional to the age of the plant parts.

whereas previous studies only investigated the effect of metals on the ethylene production levels, the aim of the present study is to unravel the mechanisms of cd-enhanced ethylene biosynthesis. therefore, we characterised the molecular basis of this response in arabidopsis thaliana plants exposed to environmentally realistic cd concentrations. we hypothesised that cd induces ethylene biosynthesis through alterations in the expression of genes encoding the acs enzymes, the rate-limiting step in ethylene biosynthesis, yielding the basis of the cd-induced ethylene production that may influence acclimation to cd stress.

RESULTS
biosynthesis of the ethylene precursor acc in wild-type plants
the immediate precursor of ethylene, acc, can be reversibly conjugated to malonyl-acc or γ-l-glutamyl-acc   <cit> , <cit> . in most cases, the presence of acc reflects the activity of the rate-limiting step in ethylene biosynthesis that eventually determines the hormonal content. in order to evaluate the effect of cd on ethylene biosynthesis, we first estimated the concentration of free as well as conjugated acc in wild-type arabidopsis thaliana plants exposed to cd.

in roots, exposure to 5 μm cd had no significant effect on the concentration of either the free or the conjugated acc . exposure to 10 μm cd on the other hand increased the concentration of both forms of acc . while the concentration of free acc was comparable after 24 h and 72 h of exposure to cd, the conjugated acc content continued to increase towards the later time point. the relative impact of cd on the content of free acc was higher compared to conjugated acc .

in leaves, both concentrations of cd induced the same significant increase in free acc, with a maximum content after 24 h of exposure . although the abundance of conjugated acc in general was always higher, the free acc content was significantly more affected by cd, whereas conjugated acc content in the leaves only showed an increasing trend after 24 h of exposure .

gene expression of genes involved in acc and ethylene biosynthesis
acc is produced by acs enzymes, originating from a multigene family. within this 12-membered family, acs <dig> is a pseudogene and acs <dig> and acs <dig> encode aminotransferases with different functions  <cit> . this leaves  <dig> actual acs genes, whose induced expression may contribute to increased acc synthesis, that were analysed in this study. the expression of acs <dig> was generally below detection limit in our experimental conditions, confirming earlier observations that acs <dig> transcription is nearly absent in vegetative tissues  <cit> . transcript levels of acs <dig>  only functional as a heterodimer, were also very low under control conditions. analysis of gene family expression included quantification of the total transcript abundance of all isoforms together, as well as the relative contribution of each member. additional file 1a and b shows the relative expression of the individual gene family members to the untreated controls.

in roots, total acs transcript abundance increased after exposure to cd in a time- and dose-dependent manner, peaking after 72 h of treatment with 10 μm cd . induction of the transcript levels of acs <dig>  acs <dig> and acs <dig> seemed to particularly contribute to this increased expression level of acs . furthermore, the gene expression of acs <dig> also increased significantly after exposure to 10 μm cd , although the relative transcript abundance remained low. in leaves, the highest increase in acs gene expression occurred after 24 h of treatment with cd . the transcript abundance of acs <dig> and acs <dig> was mostly affected upon cd exposure . expression of acs <dig> and acs <dig> was also slightly, although significantly upregulated . acs <dig> was the isoform with the most abundant transcript levels under control conditions in roots and leaves of arabidopsis thaliana, and was also cd responsive in both organs .

in addition, gene expression of the 5-membered aco multigene family, which encodes the proteins catalysing the final step of the ethylene biosynthesis, was also analysed  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> .

the rise in total transcript levels of the aco multigene family reached a maximum after 24 h of exposure to cd. in roots this was mainly due to the cd-induced aco <dig> expression, however aco <dig> transcript levels also increased after exposure to 10 μm cd . in leaves, gene expression of both aco <dig> and aco <dig> increased after treatment with  <dig> or 10 μm cd . hence, these were generally the aco isoforms with the most abundant transcript levels in both organs after cd exposure.

ethylene emission: a comparison between wild-type and acs2-1acs6- <dig> mutant plants
the production of acc by acs is the rate-limiting step in the ethylene production of arabidopsis thaliana. our qrt-pcr data suggests that mainly acs <dig> and acs <dig> contributed to the increased expression of acs genes after exposure to cd. to verify the importance of these genes for cd-induced ethylene production, wild-type and acs2-1acs6- <dig> double knock-out mutant arabidopsis thaliana plants were investigated. first, cd accumulation was compared between wild-type and mutant acs2-1acs6- <dig> plants to assess whether genotypic differences in cd uptake may be present. in hydroponically cultivated plants, the cd content in roots and leaves of both genotypes increased in a time- as well as dose-dependent manner . the cd content in plants treated with 5 μm cd was similar in roots and leaves. after exposure to 10 μm cd, roots accumulated twice as much cd compared to leaves . no significant differences in cd accumulation were observed between the wild-type and acs2-1acs6- <dig> mutant plants.

grown in different culture systems

the ethylene emission of whole plants was measured as described by woltering et al.  <cit> , using a rockwool cultivation system. since cd uptake in rockwool cultivated plants may differ from that in hydroponics, which in turn may affect ethylene production, both growth systems were also compared for cd accumulation. therefore, the internal cd concentration in the leaves of these plants was compared with the previous results of the hydroponically grown plants . overall, the cd uptake in rockwool-cultivated plants was six to fifteen times lower compared to hydroponically grown plants. cadmium accumulation in mutant plants exposed to 5 μm cd did not significantly differ from the wildtype. on the other hand, 24 h of exposure to 10 μm cd led to a significantly lower cd content in the mutant plants, but no significant differences were observed after 72 h of exposure to 10 μm cd . in order to reach internal cd concentrations comparable to those attained in hydroponically grown plants, higher external cd concentrations were applied in the rockwool cultivation system to provoke cd-induced ethylene production. consequently, concentrations of 10 μm, 25 μm or 100 μm cd were applied. exposure to the various cd concentrations always significantly increased the ethylene emission in wild-type plants. in the acs2-1acs6- <dig> double ko-mutants on the other hand, at none of the applied concentrations a cd-induced increase in ethylene emission was observed .

as already mentioned, ethylene is a modulator of growth and developmental stages during the entire life cycle of the plant and it is responsible for the induction of cell senescence. because of the difference in ethylene production between both genotypes, the biomass of roots and leaves was compared after cd exposure. furthermore, the growth inhibition caused by exposure to cd was determined in both organs relative to the controls within each genotype.

neither the wild-type nor the mutant plants showed a significant decrease in root biomass after 24 h of exposure to  <dig> or 10 μm cd . exposure to either of both cd concentrations during 72 h did induce a significant reduction in root biomass in both genotypes. the growth inhibition of the cd-exposed roots relative to the control roots was always higher in the wildtype compared to the acs2-1acs6- <dig> mutants .

in leaves, no significant differences in biomass were observed after 24 h of exposure to  <dig> or 10 μm cd between both genotypes. nevertheless, the growth was significantly inhibited in wild-type plants after 24 h of exposure to 10 μm cd, which could not be observed in the mutant plants . exposure during 72 h to either of both concentrations of cd did not induce a significant leaf biomass reduction in the acs2-1acs6- <dig> mutant plants. on the contrary, there was a significant decrease in leaf biomass of wild-type plants exposed to 10 μm cd . moreover, a significant difference in biomass between the wild-type and mutant plants exposed to 5 μm cd was observed, which was confirmed by the growth inhibition data. similar to the roots, the growth inhibition of the leaves in cd-exposed plants was always higher in the wildtype compared to the acs2-1acs6- <dig> mutants .

ethylene responsive genes: a comparison between wild-type and acs2-1acs6- <dig> mutant plants
to investigate whether the differences in ethylene production between acs2-1acs6- <dig> mutants and wild-type plants were sufficient to provoke a differential ethylene response, expression of primary ethylene responsive genes was measured in both genotypes. the genes encoding for the ethylene receptor etr <dig>  the biosynthesis enzyme aco <dig> and the ethylene response factor erf <dig> are known to be ethylene responsive  <cit> .

in roots, cd exerted the greatest effect on the expression of all three genes after 24 h of exposure. the expression of aco <dig> was significantly higher in wild-type plants as compared to the mutants after 24 h exposure to both concentrations. however, after 72 h of cd exposure there were no significant differences between wild-type and mutant plants . for etr <dig> expression, a similar pattern as for aco <dig> was observed, except after 24 h exposure to 10 μm cd, no significant differences between both genotypes were observed . the expression of erf <dig> in the wildtype was significantly higher compared to the mutant after exposure to 5 μm cd, and after 72 h of exposure to 10 μm cd .

in leaves, the expression of these three genes was always significantly higher in wild-type plants after 24 h exposure to both cd concentrations compared to the mutants . after 72 h of exposure there were less significant differences, only aco <dig> showed significantly higher transcript levels in wild-type plants compared to the mutants exposed to 5 μm cd .

discussion
cadmium stress increases ethylene production in arabidopsis thaliana
ethylene is a well-known regulator of miscellaneous plant responses, and is affected by many biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . also after exposure to excess metals, increased ethylene levels have been observed  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . ethylene is enzymatically synthesised from sam in two steps, with acs, encoded by a multigene family, as the rate-limiting enzyme  <cit> , <cit> . still, it remains unclear how an increase in ethylene release after toxic metal exposure is achieved at the molecular level. therefore, in the present study, a kinetic approach was adopted to investigate the effects of cd exposure on acc and ethylene production in arabidopsis thaliana as well as the influence of cd on the expression of the acs and aco multigene families involved in ethylene biosynthesis.

the immediate precursor of ethylene, acc, exists in a free  as well as conjugated  form. although being reversible to a certain extent, the conjugation of acc makes it, at least temporarily, unavailable for the ethylene biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . the accumulation of conjugated acc could serve to optimise free acc levels as a substrate for aco, converting it to ethylene. deconjugation can subsequently restore free acc levels to avoid depletion. in contrast with previous studies, we quantified both forms of acc separately, not only focussing on free acc. exposure to  <dig> or 10 μm cd induced the accumulation of free as well as conjugated acc in roots and leaves of wild-type arabidopsis thaliana plants grown in hydroponics . this can explain the observed increase in ethylene release under cd stress . in roots, the overall acc content is lower compared to leaves. this could be due to a lower production rate or transportation of acc from the roots to the leaves  <cit> . the fact that exposure to 5 μm cd did not significantly increase the acc content in roots could be explained by the rate-limiting character of this step. most of the acc could immediately be converted into ethylene, as observed from the ethylene biosynthesis data . this hypothesis can also be confirmed by the increase in expression of ethylene responsive genes in roots after exposure to 5 μm cd . previous studies also reported increasing acc contents in roots and leaves of tomato plants after three weeks of growth on salinised medium  <cit> - <cit> . likewise, siddikee et al.  <cit>  observed higher acc levels in roots of two weeks old red pepper plants exposed to salt stress for one week. on the contrary, ben salah et al.  <cit>  reported a decrease in acc content after 3 weeks of salt stress in roots and leaves of the salt-tolerant medicago ciliaris. in contrast with our findings, han et al.  <cit>  did not find a clear correlation between cd exposure and acc content in leaves of the halophyte kosteletzkya virginica. three weeks of exposure to 5 μm cd did not increase the acc concentration, addition of 50 mm nacl together with cd even decreased the acc content. this points to different responses in salt tolerant and sensitive species.

genes known to be responsive to elevated ethylene levels showed an increase in expression in hydroponically cultivated plants exposed to  <dig> or 10 μm cd , also indicating an augmentation of ethylene biosynthesis. the latter was verified in our study in wild-type plants grown on rockwool, displaying a dose-dependent increase in ethylene production after  <dig> and 72 h of exposure to  <dig>   <dig> and 100 μm cd . consequently both the hydroponic and rockwool growth system clearly support a cd-induced ethylene biosynthesis.

the stress related acs <dig> and acs <dig> are the main isoforms involved in cd-induced ethylene production
to further unravel these findings, the expression of genes encoding the enzymes involved in ethylene biosynthesis, acs and aco were analysed. hitherto, few studies investigated the effect of toxic metals on the differential expression of the aco multigene family members. srivastava et al.  <cit>  reported a lead-induced upregulation of a putative aco gene in sesbania drummondii. kim et al.  <cit>  observed increased aco <dig> and aco <dig> transcript levels in nicotiana glutinosa after 48 h of exposure to cu. dorling et al.  <cit>  on the other hand did not detect differences in aco transcript levels of trifolium repens after 9 days of excess manganese . to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the effect of toxic sublethal cd exposure on aco gene expression was investigated in arabidopsis thaliana. the transcript levels of aco <dig> and aco <dig>  the two most abundant members of the aco multigene family, coding for the enzymes responsible for the conversion of acc to ethylene  increased in a dose-dependent manner. these results corroborate the conclusions of ruduś et al.  <cit> , who observed upregulations of various aco genes after exposure to abiotic  and biotic  stresses, serves as a good ethylene production indicator.

the rate-limiting step in ethylene biosynthesis, however, is the conversion of sam to acc by acs  <cit> . the expression of eight different genes coding for the acs isoforms was assessed . the maximum increases in expression of acs genes, after 72 h or 24 h of exposure to cd for respectively roots and leaves, correlated well with the acc content in both organs . cadmium exposure particularly increased the abundance of acs <dig> and acs <dig> transcript levels. these two isoforms are the only active type  <dig> acs proteins, making them phosphorylation targets of mitogen-activating protein kinase  mpk3/mpk <dig>  this posttranslational modification reduces the turnover by the 26s proteasome degradation machinery, prolonging the half-life of the acs enzymes  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . in addition, mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> are also capable of inducing the transcriptional activity of acs <dig> and acs <dig> via wrky <dig>  <cit> . the involvement of mapk signalling in plants under metal stress has been reported several times  <cit> . jonak et al.  <cit>  showed that samk/simk, the arabidopsis orthologues of mpk3/mpk <dig> in medicago sativa, were activated after exposure to excess cd or cu ions. in arabidopsis thaliana, mpk3/mpk <dig> activity and mrna levels were also induced after exposure to cd  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . various other abiotic stresses are also known to elevate ethylene biosynthesis through induction of different acs transcript levels in arabidopsis thaliana <cit> . interestingly, acs <dig> and acs <dig> very often appear to regulate the production of stress ethylene in arabidopsis thaliana. acs <dig> transcript levels were shown to be elevated after exposure to ozone, li , cu, salt stress, …  <cit> , <cit> . acs <dig> gene expression was also upregulated by high salinity  <cit> . peng et al.  <cit>  reported the induction of acs <dig> and acs <dig> up to 36 h of hypoxic treatments. in addition, the necrotrophic fungus botrytis cinerea is known to induce ethylene production through an acs <dig> and acs <dig> dependent mechanism  <cit> , <cit> .

in this study, evidence for the importance of acs <dig> and acs <dig> upregulation in cd-induced ethylene production was found using the arabidopsis thaliana acs2-1acs6- <dig> double ko-mutant, which showed a much lower induction of ethylene production. the basal level of ethylene production measured in these mutants may be explained by the presence of other acs isoforms, which, because of their minor abundance after cd exposure at transcriptional  or protein level , gave rise to low ethylene levels. many of these other isoforms have been reported to be involved in developmental regulation, rather than stress  <cit> - <cit> .

no significant differences were found in cd content between wild-type and mutant plants, indicating that the absence of induction of ethylene production in mutants was not attributable to a decreased cd uptake .

with the objective to investigate the consequences for signalling and perception of the lack of ethylene biosynthesis induction, the physiological responses as well as the expression of ethylene responsive genes were measured in acs2-1acs6- <dig> mutants and compared to wild-type plants.

as mentioned, no significant differences in root fresh weight were observed between both genotypes . in leaves however, cd induced a significant growth inhibition in the wild-type but not or to a lesser extent in the mutant plants, more specifically at 24 h and 72 h for  <dig> and 5 μm cd respectively. this was also reflected in the fresh weight data . hence, within our experimental setup, the negatively affected leaf biomass in wild-type plants was a consequence of cd-induced ethylene production.

the ethylene biosynthesis gene aco <dig>  the ethylene receptor gene etr <dig> and the ethylene response factor gene erf <dig> are known to have elevated transcript levels in response to ethylene exposure  <cit> - <cit> . erf <dig> is also known to be involved in different stress responses. cheng et al.  <cit>  reported that the induction of erf <dig> gene expression after salt and dehydration stress was enhanced by ethylene signalling. therefore we assumed erf <dig> to be the most indicative ethylene responsive gene of our selection. after exposure of our plants to cd, the expression of the three genes was, as mentioned before, significantly higher in roots and leaves of wild-type plants. in the mutants, however, there was evidence for a lower induction of expression of the ethylene responsive genes . the remaining elevated transcript levels of these genes in the roots of mutant plants, especially after exposure to 10 μm cd, can be explained by the increase in expression of acs <dig>  possibly leading to increased ethylene release . after 72 h of exposure to cd the differences in ethylene responsive gene expression between the two genotypes started to fade. except for the expression of aco <dig> and etr <dig> in the leaves, the transcript levels of the ethylene responsive genes decreased compared to 24 h of exposure to cd. this could be caused by a transient response of the genes to the ethylene signal, indicating the importance of ethylene in the early response to cd stress. these results correspond to those of montero-palmero et al.  <cit> , who also observed a transient induction of ethylene responses in mercury  treated medicago sativa and arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. the increased aco <dig> and etr <dig> expression in the leaves of both genotypes after 72 h of exposure to cd could be the result of cd-induced signalling pathways independent of acs <dig> and acs <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, cd induced the biosynthesis of acc and ethylene in arabidopsis thaliana plants mainly via the increased expression of acs <dig> and acs <dig>  which was confirmed by the low ethylene levels in acs2-1acs6- <dig> double ko-mutants exposed to cd. whereas other isoforms still deliver a basal ethylene level, the lack of cd-induced increase in ethylene production in the double mutants highly diminished the fast-induced expression of ethylene responsive genes, which positively affected the plant leaf biomass.
