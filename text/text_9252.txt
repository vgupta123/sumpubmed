BACKGROUND
transcription of eukaryotic genes requires the assembly of a multiprotein preinitiation complex , including rna polymerase ii  and general transcription factors . all known eukaryotic genes require the recruitment of the tata-binding protein  for pic formation  <cit> . however, only a minority of rna pol ii genes have a consensus binding site for tbp, the tata box. for instance, in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, only 15-20 % of the rna pol ii genes that code for proteins have a canonical tata box . also, non-coding rna  genes transcribed by rna pol ii can have either tata or tata-like promoters  <cit> .

at the tata-like promoters, tbp arrives as part of the tfiid complex while the saga  complex recruits tbp at the tata box-containing genes  <cit> . binding of tbp to the tata box is stabilized by tfiia and leads to the recruitment of tfiib  <cit> , whereas the tbp-associated factors  of tfiid facilitate binding of tbp specifically to tata-like promoters  <cit> .

promoter occupancy by tbp is also subjected to negative regulation which is generally associated with inaccessibility due to chromatin structure  <cit> . proper integrity of chromatin structure is required for accurate transcription initiation and mutants with disrupted chromatin show spurious transcription initiations from cryptic promoters across the genome, including initiation at intragenic locations . other mechanisms of repression operate through the core promoter and general transcription factor interactions  <cit> . this type of negative regulation is exemplified by the actions of mot <dig> and negative cofactor  <dig> . mot <dig> is a snf <dig> family atpase that removes or redistributes tbp from promoters. nc <dig> is a heterodimer of nc2α  and nc2β   <cit>  that inhibits pic formation by interfering with the binding of tfiia and tfiib with tbp . in yeast, a genome-wide analysis has demonstrated the strong co-localization of nc <dig>  mot <dig> and tbp at many active promoters. further, a protein complex has been purified from chromatin extracts that contains nc <dig>  mot <dig>  tbp and 20–70 bp of dna  <cit> .

besides their roles in transcriptional repression, both mot <dig> and nc <dig> are involved in gene activation. the participation of mot <dig> and nc <dig> in gene activation has been related with the displacement of tbp from inappropriate genomic locations . the observation that mot <dig> and nc <dig> selectively target tata-containing genes, but not tata-like genes, for negative regulation  <cit>  is in agreement with the requirement of mot <dig> to remove tbp from the preferred tata promoters, which increases the amount of tbp available to bind intrinsically disfavored  sites  <cit> .

recently koster et al. found that depletion of mot <dig> and nc <dig> in mutants with disrupted chromatin leads to intragenic transcription in the flo <dig> gene. the effect of mot <dig> and nc <dig> in suppressing intragenic transcription is a characteristic specific to cryptic tata-containing promoters wherein they remove tbp from sites that have been exposed upon chromatin structure disruption. in contrast, depletion of mot <dig> or nc <dig> causes a decreased expression from intragenic tata-like promoters, which is consistent with a role of mot <dig> and nc <dig> in the redistribution of tbp from tata-containing to tata-like binding sites  <cit> .

the function of mot <dig> and nc <dig> responsible for removing tbp from cryptic sites is also important for restricting antisense ncrna synthesis. koster and timmers  <cit>  have shown that mot <dig> and nc <dig> restrict the formation of pics from 3′-end of genes by tbp displacement, which limits antisense ncrna production.

in this study we performed a genome-wide transcriptomic analysis to show that disruption of nc <dig> function by means of shutting off either of its two protein subunits in yeast provokes an increase in cryptic transcription both around and inside any kind of rna pol ii gene. we conclude that nc <dig> is necessary for the correct location of the pic and that its absence induces cryptic  initiations upstream of canonical promoters, in terminator regions and alongside the transcribed region.

RESULTS
ydr <dig> depletion provokes increased cryptic transcription in s. cerevisiae
with the aim of obtaining a yeast strain that lacks ydr <dig> activity, and because it is an essential gene which prevents the use deletion mutants, we constructed a conditional expression version of the ydr <dig> gene by replacing its natural promoter with the gal <dig> promoter. in this strain we analyzed the ydr <dig> levels by taking advantage of the three copies of the ha epitope that had been added to the n-terminal end of the protein during the substitution of ydr <dig> promoter for gal <dig>  <cit> . after a 4 h incubation in dextrose, we were unable to detect any ha-ydr <dig> protein by western blot  <cit> . accordingly, this strain was unable to grow in glucose.

in a first approach to analyze the transcriptomic effects upon depletion of nc <dig>  we used yeast orf macroarrays  <cit> . after 4 h in glucose,  <dig> genes showed at least a two-fold change in their expression levels in the pgal10-ydr <dig> strain compared to the wild-type control. the shutoff of ydr <dig> resulted mainly in increased transcript levels , which suggests that nc <dig> has mostly a negative effect on gene expression  <cit> . we also noticed that the list of genes with increased transcript levels under ydr1p depletion conditions contained an abnormally high proportion of genes in the “dubious orf” category, as stated in the saccharomyces genome database . as fig.  <dig> depicts, from the  <dig> “dubious” orfs detected in our analysis,  <dig> were included among the  <dig> orfs with the highest expression fold-change in the mutant compared to the wild-type strain .fig.  <dig> dubious orfs are up-regulated under ydr <dig> depletion conditions. histogram of the number orfs classified as “dubious” by sgd, included in each group of  <dig> orf, detected by yeast orf macroarrays and ranked in decreasing order of expression level in the ydr <dig> mutant vs. the wild type



these “dubious” orf were, by different criteria, unlikely to encode an expressed protein . they are often small and partially overlap with larger  orfs. it should be noted that the macroarrays used for transcriptome analyses contained probes that covered only the orf, and thus the full transcripts that exceed orf limits can overlap proximal probes that cover dubious orfs. thus, we suspected that the increase in dubious orf transcription would more likely reflect the increased cryptic transcription in the flanks of the canonical genes in the ydr <dig> mutant.

high-resolution tiling array analysis shows an increase in different kinds of cryptic transcription upon nc <dig> disruption
as a second approach, and with the aim of obtaining an expanded and more detailed view of the transcriptional impact of the depletion of nc <dig> subunits, we applied the same experimental setup by high-density strand-specific tiling arrays. this allowed us to analyze the exact position and expression level of each known or unknown transcript.

figure  <dig> shows the average metagene profiles for all the canonical yeast genes for which their transcription start sites  and polyadenylation sites  were mapped . figure 2a & b  illustrates how both shutoff mutants presented a higher relative signal in the mutant strain compared to the wild type around the promoter and terminator regions, which indicates the existence of limited regions of sense-oriented cryptic transcription. apart from this, the absence of an intact nc <dig> also clearly facilitated antisense transcription inside the coding region, especially for the bur <dig> mutant . it was also remarkable that in the antisense orientation a signal accumulated in the 5′ flank that was not present at the 3′ flank in either of the two mutants . the height and shape of the profile at the gene ends in both mutants slightly differed: bur <dig> depletion  appeared to have a stronger effect than ydr <dig> depletion  because cryptic transcription entered the coding region and the 3′ peak was relatively more pronounced than the 5′ one.fig.  <dig> nc <dig> shutoff provokes an increase in non-coding rna transcripts. metagene representation of the average transcription profiles for each analyzed gene class. ten units correspond to 200 bp. in between tss  and polya , the entire gene lengths are normalized to  <dig> units . the ordinates scale represents the ratio between the mutant and wild-type signals. a–b) canonical orfs show an increase in both the short sense transcripts in the 5′ and 3′ flanks and in antisense transcripts when blocking the transcription of both nc <dig> subunits. c–d) only minor differences are seen between tata and tata-like genes when blocking nc <dig> transcripts. e–h) cryptic mapped transcripts  show similar effects to those observed in canonical genes after shutting down nc <dig> subunits. a, c, e, g: pgal-ydr <dig> shutoff; b, d, f, h: pgal-bur <dig> shutoff. i) interpretation of the observed results. the cryptic transcripts  over a scheme for a canonical yeast gene with its typical nucleosomal organization. putative srt  and rrt  are marked. see the main text for a discussion



as yeast genes were organized into two distinct classes according to their promoter organization and different behavior during pic formation  <cit> , we wondered if the absence of nc <dig> in cryptic transcription would differently affect both kinds of promoters. figure 2c depicts how tata-containing genes  exhibited an increase in the signal in the ydr <dig> mutant, both at the gene borders and within the transcribed region, whereas tata-like genes  showed only cryptic transcripts exclusively in the gene borders described before . however, in the bur <dig> mutant, no major differences were found between both gene types, and there were clear peaks at both gene borders .

as rna pol ii also transcribes ncrnas, we wished to analyze the behavior of the nc <dig> shutoff mutants in this kind of genes. for this we used previously described lists  <cit>  of stable untranslated transcripts  and cryptic unstable transcripts . given the small number and low expression level of these ncrnas, the metagene profiles had a higher background noise than the average protein-coding gene. nevertheless, it became clear that the effect of nc <dig> depletion was similar to that in canonical genes. the differences were that the 5′ and 3′ peaks were higher , and positioned exactly at the tss and pa , or even inside the transcribed region , and not just upstream as in canonical genes. there was also some antisense transcription in suts , but none in cuts .

overall, our results led us to conclude that lack of nc <dig> increased fuzziness in the selection of the start site in all rna pol ii-dependent transcription, regardless of their protein-coding potential. this was especially relevant in the nucleosome-depleted regions at the 5′ and 3′ flanks of yeast genes , but also within the coding region.

in order to further support and validate our genome-wide conclusions, we visually inspected the tiling array data at the individual gene level to find particular genes with changes in expression in their promoter regions. figure  <dig> shows four examples of canonical genes with a “dubious” orf, or not, in their close proximity, which display a clear increase in expression in the comparison between nc <dig> mutants and the wild type. moreover, in order to experimentally confirm that the lack of nc <dig> provokes cryptic transcription, we selected two cases in which the macroarray experiment found an increase in the upstream transcription: yor184w/ser <dig> and yol039w/rpp2a . the case of ser <dig> is especially interesting because another gene involved in the serine + glycine biosynthesis pathway, ser <dig>  has been shown to be regulated by a non-coding upstream transcript, srg <dig>  <cit> . as seen in fig.  <dig>  the shutoff of ydr <dig> resulted in the appearance of small transcripts in the promoter region of both ser <dig> and rrp2a.fig.  <dig> selected examples of verified orf-genes showing cryptic transcription in their promoters. screenshots from the tiling analysis software  are shown as example of the different cryptic transcripts detected after shutting down either bur <dig> or ydr <dig>  intensity profiles on an arbitrary, but identical, scale for the mutants and wild type are shown. in , only the forward signal is shown, and both the forward and reverse intensity signals from the strand-specific microarray are shown in c. the sgd map for canonical genes is represented below and indicates the sense of transcription with an arrowhead. a) cryptic transcription in the 5′ flank of the yol039w/rrp2a gene in both nc <dig> mutants. b) cryptic transcription in the 3′ flank of the yhr163w/sol <dig> gene in both nc <dig> mutants. c) cryptic transcription in the 5′ flank of the ydl133w/srf <dig> gene in both nc <dig> mutants in both forward and reverse . d) cryptic transcription in the 5′ flank of the ydr510w/smt <dig> gene in both nc <dig> mutants. in this case the cryptic transcript could be detected with a probe from the ydr509w dubious orf as in the macroarray experiment described in fig.  <dig> and in the text

discussion
rna pol ii transcribed genes, protein-coding as well as non-coding, may contain tata or tata-like elements in their promoters  <cit> . both kind of promoters require tbp for pic formation, although the mechanism for this purpose in tata-like promoters is not yet clear  <cit> .

nc <dig> and mot <dig> are factors that seem to facilitate the interchange of tbp from dna-bound to a free state, and vice versa  <cit> . this kinetic effect on the tbp equilibrium between pic and free states seems to facilitate the binding of tbp to the non-preferred sites of tata-like promoters  <cit> . thus mot  <dig> and nc <dig> act as activators of tata-like genes and repressors of tata-containing genes. recently, m. timmers’ group has reported that depletion of the nc <dig> complex, in conjunction with mutations in chromatin remodeling or nucleosome deposition genes increases cryptic intragenic transcription  <cit> . this suggests that the cryptic tata promoters that are blocked in a wild-type chromatin context are exposed in these mutants, and are used for pic formation upon nc <dig> or mot <dig> depletion. these authors also found, in the wild-type chromatin structure, that the simultaneous depletion of mot <dig> or nc <dig> with the nrd1-nab3-sen <dig>  complex involved in cryptic transcripts degradation increases the antisense transcript production that arises from the 3′ end of selected loci  <cit> . this finding suggests that the cryptic tata promoters present at the 3′ end of most protein-coding genes in 3′-flank nucleosome-depleted regions are activated when tbp-interchange factors are absent.

our study extends these observations to the genome-wide level by showing that the activation of cryptic transcription, in both the sense and antisense directions upon nc <dig> depletion, is a general phenomenon across the yeast genome. ydr <dig> and bur <dig>  the two subunits of nc <dig>  performed similar, but not identical, activities. the depletion of either subunit resulted in transcript accumulation at both ends of genes in a genome-wide average . these peaks reflect the appearance of the short cryptic transcripts that initiated in the 5′ and 3′ nucleosome-free regions  spanning regions of less than  <dig> nucleotides . apart from these types of promoter- and terminator-associated transcripts in fig. 2a & b, we also detect increased antisense transcription along the gene body. depletion of bur <dig> has a stronger effect on intragenic antisense transcription , whereas depletion of ydr <dig> had a more marked effect on sense transcription in tata-containing genes . this latter result presumably came from the relative activation of tata-dependent genes under nc <dig> depletion conditions. in fact, we have observed that tata genes are up-regulated upon ydr <dig> depletion, whereas tata-like genes do not change . in contrast, no differences between tata and tata-like genes are found under the bur <dig> depletion conditions . thus it seems that the tbp-interchange function of nc <dig> in canonical tata promoters depends more on ydr <dig>  but bur <dig> is more important for the same function in cryptic  promoters. it is noteworthy that we found no significant antisense transcription accumulations at the 3′ nfr of all the analyzed genes . the observation of koster and timmers  <cit>  that nc <dig> depletion increases antisense transcription from 3′ ends, and our nc <dig> depletion experiments showing the appearance of antisense transcription that covered the entire gene , without a localized accumulation at the 3′ end, support the existence of well-defined tata promoters in the 3′ nfr regions that direct antisense transcription which overlaps the entire gene. existence of cryptic promoters in 3′ nfrs has been demonstrated by different groups . these promoters direct the synthesis of the antisense rco1-restricted transcripts  identified by  <cit> . rrts are suppressed by the action of rpd <dig> histone deacetylase  to avoid  the antisense transcription caused by gene looping  <cit> . the cryptic transcripts at the 5′ end, associated with the tss  are, however, independent of rpd <dig> hdac and dependent on set <dig> hdac  <cit> . we hypothesize that presence of antisense peaks in 5′ regions in all analyzed cases  may be originated from the 3′ end of contiguous canonical genes and represent the extension of the rrt transcripts that started at the tata sequences located at their terminator regions. these sequences are extremely abundant at the positions around 25– <dig> nucleotides upstream of the polya site  <cit> , direct the transcription inside the coding region, and would become activated in the nc <dig> depletion mutants .

in our study we also analyzed ncrnas, such as cuts and suts . the average transcription level for these genes is much lower than for canonical genes, which results in noisier, less detailed metagene profiles. moreover, the lack of a classification into tata and tata-like promoters for these transcripts prevents us from looking for promoter type-dependent differences. however, given these considerations, our results indicate that these genes are up-regulated in nc <dig> depletion mutants and also support the existence of flanking transcripts similar to those observed in canonical protein-coding genes.

CONCLUSIONS
given the known function of nc <dig> in the tbp interchange from free-to promoter-bound states, and also the known role of the tbp protein in determining tss recognition, it is reasonable to think that nc <dig> plays an important role during precise start site selection. our results suggest that nc <dig> plays a very general role in tss selection for rna pol ii in all kind of genes it transcribes. the ablation of the nc <dig> function increases cryptic transcription genome-wide, likely as a result of tbp being able to bind to any accessible tata promoter with greater stability than in the presence of an active nc <dig> complex. thus we hypothesize that the cryptic tata promoters which are infrequently used in wild-type cells become more active in our shutoff mutants. access to these kinds of promoters is much easier within the nfrs located at the 5′ and 3′ flanks of rna pol ii genes  <cit> . the cryptic transcripts that arise from them are probably then substrates for fast degradation by the nuclear quality control pathway  <cit> . based on our results, we have further evidence to suggest functional differences between the two nc <dig> subunits; ydr <dig> seems to be more important to tss determination in protein-coding genes, and bur <dig> in non-coding transcripts. it has been shown previously that nc <dig> subunits play different roles in transcription  <cit> . in fact, those authors showed that subunits ydr <dig> and bur <dig> are not associated in a stable complex in exponentially growing cells, and are differentially present at gene promoters. our results are an independent proof of the existence of various nc2-tbp complexes in vivo. nonetheless, future studies will continue to extend our knowledge about the particular roles of nc <dig> subunits during transcription initiation.
