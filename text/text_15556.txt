BACKGROUND
the gram positive bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae frequently colonizes the nasopharynx but can also invade the host causing serious illnesses such as pneumonia, meningitis or bacteraemia  <cit> . a principal virulence factor of s. pneumoniae is the polysaccharide capsule protecting it from host immune defences by interfering with the deposition of complement and therefore opsonophagocytosis  <cit> . the capsule is the target of all currently available pneumococcal vaccines including the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine  for children. the biochemical structure and linkage of repeating polysaccharide subunits determines the serotype of encapsulated strains. so far, more than  <dig> different serotypes have been identified  <cit>  which differ in the type and number of genes encoding the proteins responsible for transcription, polymerization, elongation and export of the capsule. for almost all serotypes the capsule-encoding operon is located between non-capsule genes dexb and alia  <cit> . the first four genes cpsa, cpsb, cpsc and cpsd are thought to play a role in regulation of capsular production and are largely conserved between serotypes  <cit> .

despite the importance of the capsule as a virulence factor, nonencapsulated pneumococci occur and in the nasopharynx may represent around 15% of pneumococcal isolates  <cit> . nonencapsulated pneumococci are generally considered not to be virulent but are associated with outbreaks of conjunctivitis  <cit> .

although lacking the protection from opsonophagocytosis which a capsule affords, the absence of capsule may confer advantages. nonencapsulated pneumococci are less sensitive to α-defensins, elastase and cathepsin g of neutrophils, possibly due to the difference in their surface charge compared to encapsulated pneumococci  <cit> . conversely, capsule might reduce agglutination by mucus, increasing access to epithelial cells and so aiding colonization, at least in mice  <cit>  and may contribute to antibiotic tolerance  <cit> .

however, laboratory-generated nonencapsulated mutants have shown that possession of a capsule is a burden for growth  <cit> . for pneumococci which do have a capsule, downregulation of its expression in response to the environment helps colonization by aiding adherence to respiratory epithelial cells  <cit> .

nonencapsulated s. pneumoniae may be divided into two groups: those which have alib-like homologues or nspa gene in place of capsule genes and those which have a capsule operon very similar to that of an encapsulated strain  <cit> . for the latter, loss of capsule expression may be due to point mutations in capsule genes or spontaneous, reversible sequence duplication or non-reversible deletion within the capsule operon as described for serotypes  <dig>   <dig>  19f and  <dig>  <cit> . in the laboratory, nonencapsulated variants can be obtained by knocking out specific genes of the capsule operon. d <dig> mutants lacking capsule genes cps2k, cpsj or cps2h required suppressor mutations in cpse  to survive  <cit> . cpse is the initial glycosyltransferase enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of the activated glucose-phosphate to the lipid carrier  <cit> . previous research has shown that a functional cpse protein is essential for encapsulation of pneumococci serotypes 9n,  <dig>   <dig>  15b and 19f  <cit> .

during our studies of nasopharyngeal clinical isolates of pneumococci we observed an isolate which gave a mixture of larger smooth colonies  and smaller rough colonies. we aimed to discover whether this was due to the presence of encapsulated and nonencapsulated versions of the same strain and, if so, to uncover the mechanism of the loss of capsule expression. we compared the two phenotypes in terms of growth, adherence to epithelial cells and competence for genetic transformation.

methods
bacterial strains
streptococcus pneumoniae strain  <dig>   was isolated in switzerland from the nasopharynx of a child with otitis media and determined to be serotype 18c by the quellung reaction as previously described  <cit> .

a single colony from the nasopharyngeal swab was cultured in broth once before freezing the stock. plating out of this stock showed that there were two  <dig>  variants  which were purified by three consecutive passaging steps where each time one single colony was picked and streaked on a columbia sheep blood agar  plate. separation was confirmed by serotyping and fitc-dextran exclusion assay .

serotyping was performed by quellung reaction with serotype-specific antisera from the statens serum institute .

restriction fragment length polymorphism  analysis was performed as described previously  <cit> , with the following modifications, to confirm that the two phenotypes had the same genetic background. the initial denaturation step was performed for 4 minutes at 95°c. denaturation temperature was 95°c in the 30 cycles of pcr. each reaction was performed in a total volume of 50 μl with  <dig> units faststart taq dna polymerase, 200 μm deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 5 μl 10× pcr reaction buffer  and 2 mm mgcl <dig> , 1 μm of each primer and 100 ng genomic dna. endonucleases afliii, apoi, ddei and msei  were used for digestion of the pcr product according the manufacturer’s instructions.

antibiotic susceptibilities
etest® strips  were used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations  for the different antibiotics according to current international recommendations . a sterile cotton swab was soaked in  <dig>  mcfarland of bacterial culture and then streaked on agar plates . ten minutes later, the etest® strips were applied on the agar plates which were then incubated for 24 h and 48 h at 37°c with 5% co <dig> atmosphere.

construction of revertant mutant strains
capsule switch mutant strains were generated for both the encapsulated and the nonencapsulated  <dig>  wild type variant using a janus cassette based on the published method  <cit> . as a first step, a janus mutant was made from each of the wild type phenotypes. next, the janus mutant  derived from the encapsulated wild type was transformed with dna from the nonencapsulated wild type strain to create the mutant  <dig>  cap-. also, the janus mutant derived from the nonencapsulated wild type was transformed with dna from the encapsulated wildtype strain to create the mutant  <dig>  cap+. wild type and mutant strains used in this study are listed in table  <dig> and the amplification and sequencing primers are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  pneumococcal strain amia <dig>  that harbours the genotype rpslk56t conferring streptomycin resistance  <cit>  served as template for rpslk56t amplification. pcr products were purified using the wizard® sv gel and pcr clean-up system . stocks of competent recipient  <dig>  variants were prepared by growing them in brain heart infusion broth   supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum   to mid-logarithmic phase  =  <dig> – <dig> ) followed by a 1: <dig> subculture in tryptic soy broth  , ph  <dig>  <cit>  to od600nm =  <dig> . bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at +4°c and resuspended in tsb, ph 8 + 15% glycerol  for storage at -80°c until use. dna was extracted using the qiaamp® dna mini kit  following the manufacturer’s instructions. transformation was based on a previous description  <cit>  diluting 100 μl of thawed competent bacteria in 900 μl fresh tsb ph  <dig> supplemented with 200 ng competence stimulating peptide . bacteria were cultured for 10 min at 37°c before 500 ng rpslk56t pcr product, 1 μg dexb-janus-alia pcr product or 2 μg genomic dna was added and the samples incubated 20–40 min at 30°c to induce competence fully, followed by 120 min incubation at 37°c. serial dilutions made in phosphate-buffered saline , ph  <dig>  were spread onto csba plates containing 300 μg/ml streptomycin and 500 μg/ml kanamycin and incubated at 37°c with 5% co <dig> atmosphere overnight. single colonies were subcultured on antibiotic selective csba plates prior to genomic dna extraction and strain preservation at -80°c . the serotype of the clinical isolates, the janus mutants and the capsule switch mutants was confirmed by the quellung reaction after transformation. insertion of the janus cassette and replacement and correct insertion of the donor capsule was confirmed by four control pcr  using the iproof polymerase . in order to confirm successful transfer of cpse wt and cpse mutated version, the pcr product was sequenced by sanger sequencing. in addition, pcr and sequencing was also performed at the sites of  <dig> other snps found to differ in the wild type phenotypes to check that these were not transferred.table  <dig>

quantification of capsule
fluorescence isothiocyanate -dextran exclusion assay
capsule thickness was determined using fluorescence labeled dextran  based a published method  <cit> . bacteria were cultured in 10 ml lacks  <cit> , 20 mm glucose to od600nm =  <dig> , centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min at room temperature, washed once with 10 ml of chemically defined medium   and then resusupended in 10 ml cdm . 800 μl were subcultured in 20 ml cdm, ph  <dig>   <dig>  mm glucose and grown to od600nm =  <dig> . the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and the pellet resuspended in 850 μl pre-chilled phosphate-buffered saline , ph  <dig> . bacterial fitc-dextran samples were prepared and visualized using a 100× objective as described  <cit> .

the zone of exclusion of fitc-dextran indicates the polysaccharide capsule thickness. the experiment was repeated three times on different days and a total of  <dig> pictures of the mixed culture  were taken. the serotype was confirmed by quellung reaction.

electron microscopy
bacteria were cultured as described above for the fitc-dextran exclusion assay, grown to od600nm of  <dig> – <dig>  in cdm, ph  <dig>   <dig>  mm glucose and harvested by centrifugation. serotype was confirmed by quellung reaction after overnight incubation at 37°c with 5% co <dig> atmosphere on csba plates.

bacteria were cryopreserved by high-pressure freezing as described before  <cit> . acetone containing 2% osmium tetroxide,  <dig> % uranyl acetate,  <dig> % ruthenium hexamine trichloride  and a total of 4% h2o served as medium for freeze substitution. the rht added improves capsule resolution  <cit> . electron micrographs from cross-sectional bacterial preparations were taken at a magnification of  <dig> 000×. the polysaccharide capsule thickness was measured perpendicular to the bacterial cell wall from at least  <dig> randomly selected bacterial cell bodies in  <dig> pictures using the free software imagej v <dig>  l . one to four measurements were taken at distinct positions of a given cell body.

growth assays
strains were streaked onto csba plates and incubated at 37°c in 5% co <dig> overnight and then subcultured in the semi-defined, nutritionally relatively rich lacks medium  <cit>  supplemented with 20 mm glucose and with the following modifications:  <dig>  mm c2h3nao2 · 3h2o,  <dig>  μm cacl <dig>   <dig>  μm mnso4 · h2o  and ≥  <dig>  <dig> u catalase  per liter lacks medium, no nac2h3o <dig> and no bovine albumin. for growth assays, cdm  <cit>  representing a nutritionally limited environment was used. since ph may affect growth and competence, cdm was stabilized using sørensen buffer , ph  <dig> instead of double-distilled water . half-loopfuls of colonies were used to inoculate 10 ml lacks supplemented with 20 mm glucose. the bacteria were grown to od600nm of  <dig>  and frozen at -80°c in aliquots in 15% glycerol. thawed bacterial suspensions were diluted in pbs ph  <dig>  and plated on csba to determine the number of colony forming units  per ml the next day. the serotype was confirmed by quellung reaction. for growth assays an inoculum of 5 × 107 cfus was used for subculture in 20 ml cdm,  <dig>  mm glucose. bacteria were grown for 10 hours at 37°c in a water bath and the od600nm measured every 30 minutes. growth assays were repeated on three different days.

transformation frequency
to compare transformation frequencies between the two phenotypes the bacteria were cultured as described for the fitc-dextran exclusion assay and grown to od600 =  <dig>  in cdm,  <dig>  mm glucose, ph  <dig>   <dig>  ml of the culture were transferred to  <dig>  ml tsb competence medium ph  <dig>  prewarmed to 30°c and incubated for 15 min at 30°c. csp- <dig> was added to final concentration of 100 ng/ml and the culture incubated for 15 min at 30°c. 1 μg of chromosomal dna from streptomycin resistant strain  <dig>   was added and the culture incubated for 60 min at 30°c, then for 120 min at 37°c. serial dilutions  in pbs ph  <dig>  were plated onto csba plates with and without 300 μg/ml streptomycin. after overnight incubation the number of colonies was counted and the transformation frequency calculated. the serotype was confirmed by quellung reaction.

adherence to and invasion of human epithelial cell line detroit 562
detroit nasopharyngeal epithelial cells  were cultured as described  <cit>  in 1× minimum essential medium  containing 2 mm l-glutamine,  <dig>  mm sodium bicarbonate, 1 × mem non-essential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate , 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum  ,  <dig> u/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and grown until reaching complete confluence at 37°c in 5% co <dig>  for adherence and invasion assays, 500 μl culture medium  with 3 ×  <dig> cells was added per well of a 24-well tissue culture plate and incubated for 24 h. s. pneumoniae was grown as described for the fitc-dextran exclusion assay in cdm,  <dig>  mm glucose, ph  <dig> to mid- logarithmic phase  and 500 μl cell culture medium  with  <dig>  ×  <dig> bacteria were added to each well containing previously washed cells . the 24-well plate was centrifuged at 423 × g for 5 minutes at room temperature. after incubation for 30 min at 37°c with 5% co <dig>  the cells were washed five times with saline to remove non-adherent bacteria and trypsinized with 200 μl  <dig> % trypsin-edta . to determine the number of invasive bacteria, the gentamicin protection assay described earlier was followed and the cells co-cultured with bacteria for 3 h at 37°c with 5% co <dig>  <cit> . the cells were washed five times with saline and 1 ml fresh mem with gentamicin sulfate salt  was added to each well for a 2 h-incubation at 37°c to kill extracellular bacteria. after washing with saline and trypsinization as described above, the cells were lysed by addition of 1% saponin  and incubation for 7 minutes at room temperature. appropriate dilutions in pbs, ph  <dig>  were plated onto csba plates and incubated overnight. the number of colony-forming units  was determined using an automated colony counter  <cit> . adherence and invasion potential of the bacteria was calculated as the proportion of recovered bacteria to the inoculum. the serotype was confirmed by quellung reaction.

whole genome analysis of bacterial genomes
whole genome sequencing
a barcoded fragment library with 400–500 bp insert size using “truseq dna truseq dna sample preparation kit”  was prepared for both bacterial genomes. the samples were sequenced in one lane of an illumina hiseq  <dig>  together with  <dig> unrelated barcoded samples. this resulted in  <dig> , <dig> paired-end reads  for sample  <dig> , encapsulated and  <dig> , <dig> paired-end reads  for sample  <dig> , nonencapsulated.

de novo assembly
the reads of the variants  <dig>  nonencapsulated and  <dig>  encapsulated were subjected to de novo assembly using spades   <cit> . only scaffolds equal or longer than 500 bp were used for the further analyses. the assembly of  <dig>  nonencapsulated resulted in 2088272 bp in  <dig> scaffolds and a n <dig> of 79979 bp. the assembly of  <dig>  encapsulated resulted in 2083495 bp in  <dig> scaffolds and a n <dig> of 71589 bp.

polymorphisms detection
to detect assembly errors, for the assemblies of the strains  <dig>  nonencapsulated and  <dig>  encapsulated a remapping was performed using bowtie <dig>   <cit> . differences were detected using samtools . to detect polymorphisms between the two strains, the reads of  <dig>  nonencapsulated were mapped to the de novo assembly  <dig>  encapsulated and vice versa. the mapping was performed using bowtie <dig> . subsequently, polymorphisms of both mappings were determined using samtools   <cit> .

RESULTS
clinical pneumococcal isolate  <dig>  consists of two variants: one encapsulated and one nonencapsulated
on plating the nasopharyngeal isolate  <dig>  onto csba plates, a mixture of large and small colonies was observed. the large colonies made up approximately 50% of the total and were serotyped as 18c  whereas repeated attempts to type the small colonies led to the conclusion that they were nonencapsulated . rflp was performed on both phenotypes and confirmed that they were of the same genetic background . following subculture in cdm with  <dig>  mm glucose, the bacteria were exposed to fitc-dextran. figure 1a shows that by fluorescence microscopy two distinct sizes of bacteria could be observed. transmission electron microscopy  showed that while the encapsulated bacteria expressed a thick polysaccharide capsule  the nonencapsulated expressed no visible capsule .figure  <dig> 
nasopharyngeal pneumococcal isolate  <dig>  is composed of encapsulated and nonencapsulated variants and the phenotype is transferred with the capsule operon. strain  <dig>  was cultured in cdm with  <dig>  mm glucose and viewed by  fluorescence microscopy in the presence of fitc-dextran . the black arrow indicates pneumococci expressing a large amount of capsule, the white arrow indicates pneumococci expressing no capsule. the two phenotypes were subcultured separately and viewed by transmission electron microscopy .   <dig>  encapsulated pneumococci expressing a thick polysaccharide capsule ,   <dig>  nonencapsulated pneumococci expressing no visible capsule. capsule switch mutants were created in which the capsule operons of the two phenotypes were exchanged.  “ <dig>  nonencapsulated” in which the operon has been replaced with that of “ <dig>  encapsulated” , expressing a thin capsule .  “ <dig>  encapsulated” in which the operon has been replaced with that of “ <dig>  nonencapsulated” , expressing no detectable capsule. em pictures  to  were taken at a magnification of  <dig> 000×.



to test the stability of the two phenotypes, each purified wild type variant was streaked onto csba plates and passaged six times over ten days on csba plates followed by culture in lacks medium with 20 mm glucose on day  <dig> and day  <dig> of the experiment. both phenotypes were stable as  <dig>  encapsulated retained its capsule as determined by quellung reaction and fitc-dextran exclusion assay and  <dig>  nonencapsulated also maintained its phenotype over the repeated passaging .

loss of capsule expression is due to a single point mutation in gene cpse
polymorphisms for each assembly of the illumina reads with a quality score of at least 200× and that were not detected as assembly error in the remapping were further analyzed.  <dig> single base pair differences  between  <dig>  encapsulated and  <dig>  nonencapsulated were revealed . one was a switch from cytosine to guanine at position  <dig> of the capsule gene cpse predicted to cause a switch from arginine to glycine at position  <dig> of the protein.table  <dig>

the role of this snp in cpse in loss of capsule expression was confirmed by exchanging the capsule operons between the encapsulated and nonencapsulated phenotypes. when the capsule operon of  <dig>  nonencapsulated was replaced by that of  <dig>  encapsulated the expression of an 18c capsule was acquired as determined by serotyping and electron microscopy . we named this mutant  <dig>  cap + . however, expression was lower than in the natural encapsulated strain: the mean thickness of the polysaccharide capsule of  <dig>  encapsulated was 137 nm and for  <dig>  cap + was 25 nm. likewise, replacing the capsule operon of  <dig>  encapsulated with that of  <dig>  nonencapsulated caused it to lose capsule as shown by electron microscopy  and it became nontypeable by quellung reaction. we named this mutant  <dig>  cap- . the six other snps identified by whole genome sequencing were not transferred  confirming that the snp in cpse is sufficient alone to change the capsule phenotype.

effect of loss of capsule expression on growth
comparison of growth in vitro in a chemically defined medium  showed that the wild type  <dig>  nonencapsulated, as well as the nonencapsulated laboratory mutant  <dig> Δcps::janus, had a clear growth advantage over  <dig>  encapsulated . the lag phase of growth was shorter and the maximal od600nm was higher for both of the nonencapsulated variants than the encapsulated .figure  <dig> 
nonencapsulated variant of strain  <dig>  has an advantage over the encapsulated variant in growth. growth was measured in vitro in cdm with  <dig>  mm glucose by determining od600nm over 10 hours. results show a representative of three independent experiments . wild type  <dig>  encapsulated , wild type  <dig>  nonencapsulated , laboratory mutant  <dig> Δcps`:janus, nonencapsulated .



effect of loss of capsule on adherence and invasion
for  <dig>  encapsulated 1% of the inoculum adhered compared to 115% for  <dig>  nonencapsulated. the relative value of adherent nonencapsulated  <dig>  bacteria was presumably greater than 100% due to growth of the bacteria during the assay. this represents a 117-fold greater adherence for the nonencapsulated phenotype compared to the encapsulated . invasion of the epithelial cells was also greater for the nonencapsulated phenotype:  <dig> % for  <dig>  nonencapsulated and  <dig> % for  <dig>  encapsulated, a difference of 183-fold reflecting the difference in adherence.figure  <dig> 
adherence of the two wild type variants to detroit  <dig> human epithelial cells. means from three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate, are shown. errors bars represent sem. the statistical analysis was performed using unpaired t test with welch’s correction.



antibiotic susceptibility
there were no significant differences in susceptibility of the two wild type variants to the antibiotics tested: ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, ceftriaxone, cephalothin, vancomycin, rifampicin, gentamicin, minocycline, tetracycline and colistin .

comparison of gene expression between encapsulated and nonencapsulated variants
gene expression was investigated by microarray which showed that  <dig>  encapsulated and  <dig>  nonencapsulated expressed the genes of the capsule operon to an equal extent. this was confirmed for the first gene of the capsule operon, cpsa, by real-time rt-pcr . however, seven other genes were upregulated in  <dig>  nonencapsulated compared to  <dig>  encapsulated between  <dig> and 34-fold . for one of the genes, comx, expression was also determined by real-time rt-pcr by three independent experiments, each in triplicate. comparing expression to that in the wild type encapsulated strain, a mean  <dig> fold higher expression was found in the wild type nonencapsulated strain,  <dig> fold higher in the  <dig>  cap- mutant  and  <dig> fold in the janus mutant which lacks the entire capsule operon. using the student t test with welch’s correction these differences are not statistically significant, but the finding that nonencapsulated variants have a higher expression of comx than the encapsulated was consistent and in agreement with the microarray results. strikingly, all seven genes identified by microarray were linked to competence, prompting us to compare the transformation frequencies between the variants.  <dig>  encapsulated showed a mean transformation frequency of  <dig> % and  <dig>  nonencapsulated of  <dig> % . this represents a  <dig> -fold greater transformation frequency by the nonencapsulated variant compared to the encapsulated variant . expression of no other genes differed significantly between the encapsulated and nonencapsulated phenotypes.table  <dig>

discussion
large and small pneumococcal colonies obtained from the nasopharynx of a child suffering from otitis media were due to two different patterns of capsule expression by one strain. the large colonies were due to bacteria expressing a thick capsule of serotype 18c and the small colonies were due to bacteria producing no detectable capsule. the difference was due to a single point mutation in the capsule gene cpse. the resulting loss of capsule expression had clear consequences resulting in increased bacterial growth, adherence to epithelial cells and competence for genetic transformation. we speculate that the mutation occurred in vivo because the isolate contained an approximately 1: <dig> ratio of the encapsulated and nonencapsulated phenotypes. this is unlikely to have been achieved during the brief single laboratory culture before freezing the sample. we therefore conclude that the original colony derived directly from the patient contained a mixture of the encapsulated and nonencapsulated phenotypes.

mutations in cpse have been shown previously to lead to loss of capsule expression in clinical isolates. in  <dig>  melchiorre et al., reported two pneumococcal isolates from patients with bacteraemic pneumonia. these isolates were nonencapsulated but with capsule operons very similar to those of serotype 7f strains. the isolates had two distinct point mutations in cpse both resulting in premature termination of transcription, cpse which was truncated at the c terminus and loss of encapsulation in these two strains  <cit> . cpse is the initial glycosyltransferase responsible for the addition of activated glucose-phosphate to the lipid carrier in the bacterial membrane  <cit> . laboratory-generated cpse knock-out mutants are also nonencapsulated  <cit> . here it appears that an encapsulated and nonencapsulated phenotype can co-exist in the nasopharynx. it is also the first time a naturally-occurring mutation in cpse leading to loss of capsule expression has been described in a serotype 18c strain. unlike the snp described by melchiorre et al., the snp described here does not result in a premature stop codon but rather an amino acid change from arginine to glycine. in addition, the location of the snp differs from those described previously  <cit> . our data suggest that the amino acid at position  <dig> in the cytoplasmic c terminal region of cpse is critical for the function of the protein and therefore polysaccharide capsule production. cpse is the first serotype specific gene following the conserved genes cpsa to cpsd  <cit> . however, there is high sequence similarity of cpse gene throughout the serotypes  <cit>  which raises the possibility that snps in cpse may be a more general phenomenon to control capsule expression in other serotypes. this mechanism seems to be irreversible in contrast to the previously described mechanism of loss of capsule expression by spontaneous sequence duplication in the capsule operon  <cit> . its irreversible nature, the apparent complete loss of capsule in the nontypeable phenotype and the fact that the two phenotypes did not vary in their expression of virulence gene such as nana, hyla, pspa and cbpa differentiate the phenomenon we describe here from transparent/opaque phase variation  <cit> .

we have shown before that loss of capsule affects phenotype, especially growth  <cit>  and others have shown that a loss of capsule is associated with a gain in adherence to epithelial cells  <cit> . however, in our previous publication we used laboratory-generated capsule mutants in which the capsule operon was deleted and replaced by a janus cassette. here we show that in a nonencapsulated mutant that has lost its capsule naturally in vivo we also see the same effect i.e. an enhancement of growth.

transformation is an important feature of the pneumococcus and does occur in its natural human environment  <cit> . nonencapsulated strains are known to be more transformable than encapsulated strains  <cit>  but our results indicate that this is not only due to a loss of the barrier of the capsule but also to an upregulation of genes involved in the competence pathway. four temporally distinct expression profiles have been described in competence: early, late and delayed gene induction, and gene repression  <cit> . we noted with interest that the nonencapsulated phenotype had a higher expression of only the early competence genes compared to the encapsulated phenotype. upregulation of early competence genes has been observed in tissue infections such as pneumonia and meningitis, but not sepsis, and may be linked to the pneumococci being in a biofilm-like state  <cit> . whether the nonencapsulated phenotype described here is more often associated with biofilm than the encapsulated phenotype remains to be investigated.

we did not find a difference in antibiotic susceptibility between the two phenotypes. fernebro et al. have shown that capsule expression reduces antibiotic-induced lysis however here we measured antibiotic resistance by etest® and did not attempt to compare lytic responses  <cit> .

a limitation of our study is that our isolate was from one patient at one timepoint. although the fact that the two phenotypes were found at a ratio of approximately 1: <dig> suggests that they can co-exist in vivo, we do not know whether over time one phenotype would out-compete the other. we speculate that the nonencapsulated variant would have an advantage in colonization due to better growth and adherence and also be more able to take up foreign dna  giving it an advantage but we would need to make a study over time to determine this.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that cpse is critical for capsule expression in multiple serotypes. mixtures of large and small colonies often seen in diagnostic laboratories and interpreted to be a mixture of strains could alternatively be a mixture of an encapsulated strain and its naturally-occurring nonencapsulated mutant. the link between loss of capsule expression and increased transformability may be due not only to a loss of the capsule barrier but also due to an upregulation of expression of genes of the competence pathway.
