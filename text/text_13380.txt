BACKGROUND
the fungus candida albicans is an important cause of human disease, causing tenacious superficial and life-threatening systemic infections. its virulence depends to a large extent on its ability to switch between a yeast and a hyphal growth form  <cit> . environmental conditions favouring hyphal development include molecules of the human host acting as inducers, as well as physical parameters such as body temperature. protein kinase a  isoforms tpk <dig> and tpk <dig> have crucial roles as signalling kinases because they mediate several adaptation responses to host contact . in inducing conditions, camp is generated by adenylate cyclase  and triggers pka activity by binding and removal of the inhibitory subunit bcy <dig>  which associates with tpk <dig> and tpk <dig> . the camp-pka pathway subsequently activates the efg <dig> transcription factor, which represents the central hub controlling downstream events including morphogenesis and metabolic adaptation . efg <dig> fulfills its morphogenetic functions by association with co-regulators czf <dig>  flo <dig>  slf <dig> and slf <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, in spite of their association with the same regulator protein bcy <dig>  both pka isoforms exert specific environment-dependent functions with regard to hyphal morphogenesis  <cit>  and tpk <dig> but not the tpk <dig> isoform mediates downregulation of efg <dig> expression early in hyphal induction  <cit> .

pka localization differs among species: in budding yeast the pka holoenzyme is localized in the nucleus  <cit> , whereas in fission yeast it resides in the cytoplasm  <cit>  and in mammalian cells pka catalytic subunits bind to anchoring proteins in different intracellular localizations  <cit> . in spite of these differences, it appears that in all species important agc kinase activities are needed in the nucleus. increased camp levels lead to partial entry of pka catalytic subunits into nuclei of fission yeast  <cit>  and mammalian cells  <cit> . in c. albicans, phosphorylation of the tpk <dig> target protein efg <dig> is likely to occur in the nucleus since efg <dig> has been detected exclusively in the nucleus  <cit> . in saccharomyces cerevisiae, activated pka and the mitogen-activated protein kinase  hog <dig> were found to associate with promoters and coding regions of genes regulated by these kinases . action of the hog <dig> mapk on the sko <dig> trancriptional repressor required the activity of kinase sch <dig>  which is structurally related to pka, on the promoters of target genes  <cit> . the latter findings suggested that also in c. albicans, tpk isoforms and possibly other kinases reside on genes that represent downstream targets of pka signalling during hyphal morphogenesis. in this study, we strengthen this concept by demonstrating that pka isoforms reside on specific genomic locations that change dramatically during morphogenesis from orf to promoter regions. during the yeast-hyphal transition, genomic tpk <dig> binding sites identify genes with known functions in dimorphism and suggest the identity of new genes involved in this cellular differentiation process.

RESULTS
c. albicans strains producing ha-tagged pka kinases
the single remaining allele encoding the catalytic subunits of pka kinase was modified in heterozygous c. albicans mutants to add sequences specifying a c-terminal triple hemagglutinin  epitope tag. immunoblotting revealed the presence of ha-fusions to tpk <dig> and tpk <dig> proteins in cellular extracts of these strains during yeast growth . immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the majority of fusion proteins resided in the cytoplasm of cells, while a minor fraction of tpk2ha was also detectable at the inside rim of the nucleus . similar tpk cellular localization was observed in cells that were briefly  induced by 10% serum to form hyphae .figure  <dig>

a. immunoblotting to detect ha-tagged pka subunits. strains were grown in liquid ypd medium to od600 =  <dig> - <dig>  and proteins in cell extracts  were separated by sds-page , blotted onto pvdf membranes and probed using anti-ha antibody. strains tested were caf2- <dig> , af <dig> , af <dig> , af <dig>  and af <dig> .
b. fluorescence microscopy of transformant cells treated with rat anti-ha antibody, which was detected with fitc-labelled anti-rat antibody  and dapi to detect nuclei ; yellow overlay signals are indicated by white triangles. c. filament formation of strains producing ha-tagged tpk proteins. strains caf2- <dig> , ii , tpk <dig> , tpo <dig>  , af <dig> , af <dig>  and af <dig>  were grown for  <dig> d/37°c on spider agar and single colonies were photographed.



to verify that ha fusion proteins were functional in the constructed strains we tested their filamentous growth, which is known to be regulated by the activity of tpk <dig> and tpk <dig> proteins  <cit> . inactivation of a single tpk <dig> allele abolishes hyphal growth  <cit>  but the tpk1ha/tpk <dig> transformant formed hyphae as the wild-type strain  indicating that the tpk1ha fusion protein is functional. both tpk <dig> alleles need to be inactivated to prevent hyphal growth  <cit> ; therefore, it was verified that the filamentation phenotype of the tpk2ha/tpk <dig> strain mimicked the tpk2/tpk <dig> strain but not the tpk2/tpk <dig> homozygous mutant . this result shows that the tpk2ha fusion protein is functional. in summary, use of ha-tagged tpk proteins revealed that in c. albicans as in fission yeast  <cit>  the majority of pka is located in the cytoplasm. the exclusive localization of a possibly non-functional tpk1-gfp fusion within the nucleus  <cit>  was not confirmed by the ha-tagged tpk <dig> protein.

genomic localization of tpk proteins
the above results suggested that a minor fraction of cellular pka catalytic subunits resides in the nucleus of c. albicans cells. furthermore, the presence of pka isoforms and other kinases at target genes had been demonstrated previously in s. cerevisiae. to verify, if nuclear pka isoforms bind specific genomic targets in c. albicans we performed chip chip experiments with strains containing ha-tagged pka isoforms; strains producing authentic non-tagged tpk proteins were used as reference strains. tpk <dig> and tpk <dig> localization was examined during yeast growth or alternatively, following a brief period  of hyphal induction by 10% serum. during this time period, early regulatory processes take place that reprogram cells to allow hyphal growth. this became evident in wild-type cells by the formation of germ tubes after 30–60 min of induction.

a significant number of tpk genomic binding sites was identified in both yeast and hyphal cells in duplicate chip chip experiments . about tenfold more tpk <dig> than tpk <dig> binding sites were detected during yeast growth but tpk <dig> binding increased during hyphal induction. a particular importance of the tpk <dig> isoform for c. albicans morphogenesis under liquid growth conditions was reported previously  <cit> . the most significant peaks, which were overlapping in both replicates, were defined as binding sites. these sites were associated with orf and promoter sequences of target genes . analyses indicated that very rarely, both tpk <dig> and tpk <dig> bind to same gene . an exception is hgc <dig> encoding an important regulator of hypha formation  <cit> , which bound both tpk <dig> and tpk <dig> during hyphal induction. this result indicates that both catalytic pka isoforms have mostly different genomic targets.figure  <dig>

importantly, during yeast growth both tpk <dig> and tpk <dig> were bound mostly within orfs of target genes, while hyphal induction reduced orf binding and favoured promoter binding or joint promoter-orf binding . under yeast and hyphal growth conditions, all tpk <dig> target genes and the majority of tpk <dig> target genes were different . thus, orf-to-promoter switching rarely occurs on the same gene during yeast-hyphal morphogenesis.

growth of c. albicans in rich medium does not trigger hyphal formation, because pka activity is repressed by the regulatory pka subunit bcy <dig>  <cit> . to test if during yeast growth both tpk isoforms and bcy <dig> bind to orfs a chip chip experiment was performed on a bcy1ha/bcy <dig> strain . immunoblotting showed the production of ha-tagged bcy <dig> in transformants  and immunofluorescence demonstrated that this protein resides mainly in the cytoplasm . the bcy1ha fusion produced by transformants is functional because the bcy1ha/bcy <dig> strain was insensitive to heat shock  , unlike a bcy1/bcy <dig> strain  <cit> . data analyses revealed a moderate number of genomic bcy <dig> binding sites during yeast growth . however, binding sites did not coincide to a great extent with tpk <dig> or tpk <dig> binding sites, either during yeast growth or during hyphal induction . these results indicate that in general, tpk <dig> or tpk <dig> isoforms do not bind to target orfs in the form of tpk-bcy <dig> holoenzyme complexes. conceptually, orf-bound tpk proteins could either be active because of the absence of bcy <dig> or their activities may be regulated by yet unknown mechanisms.

gene ontology analysis of pka binding sites
gene ontology  analyses  <cit>  of genes close to or harbouring pka binding sites revealed significant go terms for tpk <dig> kinase but not for the tpk <dig> isoform in any growth condition. during yeast growth, tpk <dig> bound preferentially to orfs  of genes encoding components of the general transcription machinery , in addition to orfs encoding transcription factors involved in carbon source utilization  or filamentous growth  . furthermore, orfs of genes for components of signalling pathways leading to hyphal formation  were bound by tpk <dig> during yeast growth . during hyphal induction, tpk <dig> bound mostly to promoter regions of genes involved in filamentous growth  . tpk <dig> target sites included promoters of genes encoding  <dig> transcription factors directly binding dna . in summary, tpk <dig> genomic binding shows a distinctive pattern of binding to morphogenesis-related genes, specifically the binding to orfs during yeast growth and to promoters during hyphal induction. tpk <dig> target genes are often bound also by efg <dig>  <cit>  in promoter regions or by the set3c histone deacetylase complex  <cit>  within their orfs . recently, direct binding of heat shock factor-type transcriptional regulators sfl <dig> and sfl <dig> to efg <dig> has been demonstrated  <cit> , a finding also associating the genomic localization of these regulators with tpk <dig> binding sites. in summary, tpk <dig> binding identifies genes with known functions in filamentous growth and predicts such functions for yet uncharacterized c. albicans genes .figure  <dig>

orf binding during yeast growth
orf binding by pka isoforms occurred mainly during yeast growth and included two relevant c. albicans genes, efg <dig> and msb <dig>  efg <dig> is required for the initial phase of yeast-hyphal transition but it is downregulated rapidly by negative autoregulation to allow undisturbed morphogenesis  <cit> ; downregulation requires the tpk <dig> but not the tpk <dig> pka isoform  <cit> . msb <dig> encodes a membrane sensor for environmental cues leading to hypha formation via the cek <dig> mapk and its shed domain provides resistance to antimicrobial peptides  <cit> .

during yeast growth, tpk <dig> but not tpk <dig> was bound to the efg <dig> orf. binding was also observed to the upstream gene  but not to the downstream gene  of efg <dig> . similarly, tpk <dig> but not tpk <dig> bound the msb <dig> orf in a distinct peak . comparisons of msb <dig> transcript levels in a wild-type strain and a homozygous tpk <dig> mutant, grown in the yeast form, revealed no significant differences . similarly, efg <dig> promoter activity did not differ significantly between a wild-type and a tpk <dig> mutant strain  <cit> . we conclude that tpk <dig> residency at both target loci has no major influence on transcription/transcript levels, although subtle regulatory influences on gene expression cannot be excluded. a function of tpk <dig> binding at orfs is suggested by a distinct codon preference in the tpk <dig> binding region .figure  <dig>

 or orf <dig> 
 in yeast or in induced cells were determined by qpcr in wild-type caf2- <dig>  or in tpk2Δ mutant cells  growing in the yeast form or induced 30 min for hypha formation. transcript levels relative to the act <dig> transcript  are shown for two biological replicates  indicating means and standard deviations for three technical replicates.



promoter binding during hyphal induction
during hyphal induction pka isoforms bound preferentially to promoter regions. at the efg <dig> promoter extensive binding of tpk <dig> but not of tpk <dig> was detected . the broad tpk <dig> binding area ranges from the efg <dig> transcriptional start site through 1169 bp untranslated upstream sequences and ends close to the 3′end of the efg <dig> orf. the tpk <dig> binding area matches one of the major binding sites for efg <dig> in the yeast form indicating that shortly after hyphal induction, tpk <dig> binding occurs concomitant with the release of efg <dig>  <cit> . efg <dig> promoter downregulation had been also observed in a tpk <dig> mutant  <cit>  suggesting that tpk <dig> has no major role in negative autoregulation of efg <dig> 

during hyphal morphogenesis, binding of tpk <dig> within promoter regions of several genes was correlated with transcript levels of these genes . the transcript of the sok <dig> gene  was downregulated during hyphal induction in wild-type strains, which did not occur but was even upregulated in a tpk <dig> mutant . the tpk <dig> binding peak  lies directly upstream of the transcriptional start site of sok <dig> at position  <dig> , <dig>   <cit> . during hyphal induction, tpk <dig> binding in the intergenic region between orf <dig>  and msb <dig> genes did not affect the msb <dig> transcript but correlated with an increased level of the orf <dig>  transcript in the tpk <dig> mutant . furthermore, transcript upregulation of hyr <dig> and ece <dig> genes, which are expressed specifically in the hyphal growth form  <cit> , was completely abolished in the tpk2Δ strain .figure  <dig> 
tpk <dig> promoter binding during hyphal induction. tpk <dig> localization was determined in cells induced for hypha formation at sok1
, hyr1
 and ece1
 genomic loci. chip chip occupancy values of tpk2ha were determined in duplicates as in figure 4; peak binding areas are marked by a dotted box. all three genes contain efg <dig> binding sites within their promoters  at the indicated coordinates; positions marked were reported by nobile et al. <cit>  and by lu et al. <cit>  . the kinked arrow indicates the sok <dig> transcript start site  <cit> . transcript levels for each gene during yeast growth or hyphal induction were determined by qpcr as in figure 4b.



promoter regions of sok <dig>  hyr <dig> and ece <dig> genes are known to bind the efg <dig> regulator relatively late during hyphal induction  <cit>  or during biofilm formation  <cit> , while no efg <dig> binding was detected shortly  after hyphal induction  <cit> . interestingly, efg <dig> binding sequences are not identical but overlap partially with the sequences bound by tpk <dig> . taken together, these results suggest that tpk <dig> binding to promoters has the potential to regulate transcription of c. albicans genes both negatively and positively, possibly involving subsequent binding of efg <dig> as a pka phosphorylation target  <cit> .

sequence motifs in tpk <dig> binding regions
sequences representing the binding peaks of pka were analysed for consensus sequences using the rsat programs dyad-analysis and peak-motifs  <cit> ; both algorithms generated identical results. while no significant consensus motifs were detected for tpk <dig>  tpk <dig> showed clear sequence preferences. if cells were grown in the yeast form, tpk <dig> binding occurred most frequently within orfs  at accac, ccacc or cagc motifs . during hyphal induction, however, when tpk <dig> binds predominantly within promoter regions , a completely different set of binding preferences was found . the identified a5ga <dig> and a2ga <dig> motifs match the a2ga <dig> motif for binding of the azf <dig> transcriptional regulator in s. cerevisiae, which is required for glucose-induced gene transcription  <cit> . consistent with this activity, effective hypha formation in c. albicans is known to require low levels of glucose  <cit> . the identified aac, aag and acc repeats, which were identified in most tpk <dig> binding sites, had been also detected previously for the efg <dig> transcriptional regulator during hyphal induction  <cit> . the hyr <dig> and ece <dig> genes, which are induced by hypha formation  <cit> , contain these consensus sequence motifs, possibly to permit binding of kinase and its downstream target efg <dig> to jointly trigger morphogenesis-dependent gene expression.figure  <dig> 
tpk <dig> binding specificity. a. consensus sequences for tpk <dig> binding sites in yeast cells  or in cells induced for hypha formation . the program rsat dyad-analysis  <cit>  was used to predict consensus sequences. predicted dyads  common to tpk <dig> binding sites were ranked and qualified by their p-/e-values; the frequencies of the deduced consensus sequences and of closely related sequences relative to all binding sites are listed below each table. b. occurrence of trinucleotides/codons in orf regions bound by tpk <dig> during yeast growth. codons corresponding to the tpk <dig> binding consensus sequence are listed, along with codon frequencies in all c. albicans orfs, in a randomly picked group of  <dig> genes not binding tpk <dig>  and in the  <dig> tpk <dig> binding regions occurring mostly within orfs.



binding of tpk <dig> to many orfs raised the question if such bound orf sequences were as free as unbound regions to evolve sequence variants, e. g. with regard to the usage of synonymous codons. therefore, we compared overall c. albicans codon usage with codon usage in orf sequences bound by tpk <dig>  specifically, we investigated if codons corresponding to the deduced tpk <dig> binding consensus sequences would be preferred in the tpk <dig> binding region. it was indeed found that usage of all six codons matching the tpk <dig> consensus sequence during yeast growth was increased as compared to the average codon usage in c. albicans or to random set of  <dig> orfs  that are not bound by tpk <dig> . in the case of histidine even a complete reversal of codon usage from the preferred cat codon  to cac  was observed in the tpk <dig> binding region. this result suggests that orf binding tpk <dig> has a vital, yet unknown function, because it exerts selective pressure to restrict codon usage within orfs. codon usage has hitherto been related mainly to abundance of aminacyl-trnas  <cit> .

pka localization at the efg <dig> locus
the efg <dig> gene is a paradigm of both pka and efg <dig> binding to a genomic locus . early during hyphal induction the efg <dig> transcript level is lowered rapidly, presumably because the continued presence of efg <dig> disturbs hyphal morphogenesis  <cit> . efg <dig> downregulation requires the efg <dig> protein and the tpk <dig> pka isoform  <cit>  within a short time window to initiate hyphal formation, because both proteins leave the efg <dig> locus rapidly thereafter. possibly, genomic binding of both proteins prepares yeast cells to undergo hyphal morphogenesis rapidly in inducing environments. binding of the tpk <dig> isoform at promoter and coding region of efg <dig>  as well as binding of the set3c histone deacetylase complex to the orf  <cit>  may also help to establish the repressed state of efg <dig> during hyphal formation. efg <dig> expression is probably regulated by additional proteins binding the efg <dig> promoter directly or indirectly by adapter proteins including efg <dig>  candidate efg1-binding proteins localized to the efg <dig> promoter include czf <dig>  flo <dig>  sfl <dig>  sfl <dig> and ndt <dig> proteins  <cit> . tpk <dig> binding to the set <dig> and sfl <dig> promoters, which we observed , may support this activity. co-operation of tpk <dig> and efg <dig> may also occur at other genes regulated by hyphal induction including hyr <dig>  ece <dig> and sok <dig> genes, as described above. thus, the proposed tpk <dig> phosphorylation of efg <dig>  <cit>  and other components of the transcriptional initiation machinery could occur directly at the promoters of genes regulating morphogenesis.figure  <dig> 
residency of pka isoforms at the
efg1
locus during hyphal induction. during yeast growth, efg <dig>  <cit>  and tpk <dig> proteins reside on promoter and orf, respectively, and efg <dig> is transcribed at high levels . during initiation of hyphal formation, increased camp levels activate tpk isoforms by removing bcy <dig> repression and tpk <dig> phosphorylates efg <dig>  <cit> . this is followed by rapid removal of both efg <dig>  <cit>  and tpk <dig> . subsequently the tpk <dig> isoform enters the efg <dig> promoter at one of the previous efg <dig> binding sequences and the set3c histone deacetylase  <cit>  occupies the orf. other proteins including czf <dig>  sfl <dig>  sfl <dig> and ndt <dig> are known to bind the efg <dig> promoter  <cit>  and may contribute to tpk-dependent regulation of efg <dig> expression.



CONCLUSIONS
pka isoforms tpk <dig> and tpk <dig> are crucial for the virulence of the human fungal pathogen c. albicans by regulating dimorphic growth. tpk proteins mediate environmental cues and trigger hyphal morphogenesis by altering the transcriptional program. we show that tpk <dig> and to a lesser extent tpk <dig> bind to specific genomic sequences within orfs and promoters of target genes. growth in the yeast form triggers tpk binding to ca-rich sequences within orfs and appears to bias codon usage within the binding region. during hyphal induction tpk <dig> associates with promoter regions of genes regulating or regulated by hyphal morphogenesis, often proximal to binding sites for the efg <dig> transcription factor. these results suggest that genomic pka proteins facilitate and/or prolong hyphal morphogenesis by acting on nearby transcription factors at genes regulating morphogenesis. molecular mechanisms of pka nuclear import, genomic recruitment and function remain to be established. in conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time in a fungal pathogen that pka isoforms, which are responsible for a relatively simple developmental program in a single cell, mark downstream target genes. such binding analyses have predictive value because they link yet uncharacterized genes to signalling by pka isoforms. this concept may hold true for other cellular differentiation processes involving other types of kinases and other species.
