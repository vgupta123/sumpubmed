BACKGROUND
low temperature has strong influence on the geographical distribution, growing season, quality and yield of plants. previous reports have shown that plants may develop acquired freezing tolerance after exposure to non-freezing low temperatures  <cit> . plant cells cope with cold stress by regulating the expression of transcription factors and effectors during non-freezing low temperatures  <cit> . however, the transcriptome-level changes that underlie perception of temperatures below zero, which may be related to the ability to survive under extremely low temperatures  <cit> , is poorly understood comparing that with cold sensing above freezing temperature.

a variety of cold-responsive  genes that are under the control of some key transcription factors  are thought to be involved in cold sensing  <cit> . for example, the well characterized tf dreb1/cbf can regulate a subset of cor genes by binding the dre/crt cis-elements in promoter regions of cor genes . by studying the dreb1/cbf network pathway, the roles of cellular or environmental factors, e.g. calcium, light, and circadian rhythm, are revealed in cold acclimation  <cit> . the dreb1/cbf pathway in chilling response seemed well characterized in some plants, and its regulon has been identified in brassica napus, rice, and poplar. however, the molecular mechanisms of cold-acclimation response are not well understood at the whole genome or transcriptome level since only 12% of cold responsive genes are members of the cbf regulon  <cit> . it remains to be answered whether low temperature perception occurs below freezing temperature, and if so, whether it occurs by a similar molecular mechanism as above freezing temperature.

populus euphratica oliv. is naturally distributed in semiarid areas and plays an important role in maintaining local arid ecosystems  <cit> . they distinguish themselves considerably from other species by growing in deserts with extremely salty soil and wide environmental temperature ranges. thus, p. euphratica has been widely considered as a model species for elucidating abiotic resistance mechanisms in trees . screening for cold responsive genes in p. euphratica can be a useful approach to understand the responses of woody plants to low temperatures and can also help elucidate the difference in cold perception between below- and above- freezing temperatures.

recently, the development of illumina/solexa-based deep-sequencing technologies has made it possible to capture an unbiased view of the rna transcript profile of a species under a given condition at the whole genome level  <cit> . using this method, ests and numerous novel transcripts have been discovered in a tissue-specific manner  <cit> . in the current study, we sought to identify genes linked to low temperature  perception and to explore the regulatory and sensory mechanisms involved in low temperature response processes by performing de novo assembly of the p. euphratica transcriptome using solexa data. two-year-old plants were subjected to temperatures of 4°c and a further drop to -4°c to conduct comprehensive analysis of transcriptional responses. the acquired information may facilitate attempts to elucidate response mechanisms of this species to chilling stress and will help in the development of strategies for improving of freezing tolerance in trees.

RESULTS
reads assembly and poplar databses alignment
three cdna libraries were generated with mrna from control , 4°c- or -4°c-treated p. euphratica plants and sequenced by illumina deep-sequencing. after removing adapters, low-quality sequences, and ambiguous reads, a total of  <dig> million,  <dig> million, and  <dig> million clean reads with a mean length of 90 bp were generated in the control , 4°c-treated sample , and -4°c-treated sample , respectively . the raw data were deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive  under the accession number srp <dig>  the total length of the reads was > <dig> gigabases , equivalent to ~75-fold coverage of a p. trichocarpa genome. all trimmed reads were de novo assembled into contigs by the trinity method  <cit> . the average contig size exceeded 320 bp in each of the three libraries . using paired-end information, the contigs were joined into assembled unigenes. over 80% reads could be mapped back to the assembled transcripts, indicating a high quality of assembly . finally,  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of  <dig>  bp and n <dig> of  <dig>  bp were assembled . all unigenes were longer than 200 bp and  <dig> %  of them were longer than  <dig>  bp .table  <dig>

to estimate the representation of unigenes in the collection, all unique sequences generated from different assemblages were subjected to a blast comparison to compare est collections from a variety of populus species. the results indicated that our assemblages covered most p. euphratica transcripts . by performing blastx against the populus trichocarpa v <dig> dataset with an e-value of  <dig> e- <dig> as threshold,  <dig>  ests were assigned with an identity score ≥ 75%, covering  <dig> % of assembled unigenes . of these unigenes,  <dig>   <dig>  members shared >90% identity with their homologs from p. trichocarpa. meanwhile,  <dig>  homologs  of p. trichocarpa v <dig> gene models have been sequenced. all these results indicate that our rna-sequencing data has high contiguity, coverage, and could be used for further analyses.

functional annotation and classification of the unigenes
using the best hits found by blastx or blastn with an e-value of <  <dig> e- <dig>  all of the unigenes were annotated according to the public databases including non-redundant protein  database, non-redundant nucleotide  database, swissprot, kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database and clusters of orthologous groups  database on the basis of similarities. the number of unigenes annotated with each database is summarized . of the  <dig>  high-quality unique sequences,  <dig>   unigenes had at least one significant match to an existing gene model in the blast searches . by performing blastx against the nr database with an e-value cut-off of  <dig> e- <dig>   <dig>  blastx hits were obtained, covering  <dig> % of the annotated unigenes. within the p. euphratica unigene set,  <dig>   unigenes were categorized  in  <dig> cog clusters . the five largest categories were: 1) general function predictions only , 2) transcription , 3) replication, recombination and repair , 4) signal transduction mechanisms  and 5) post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperones . classification of gene ontology  terms was performed according to the nr annotation using the blast2go software  <cit> . in the category of biological process, the largest groups were cellular process, metabolic process, response to stimulus, and biological regulation . as for the molecular function category, unigenes with binding and catalytic activity formed the largest groups.figure  <dig>

to obtain a better understanding of the biological functions of the unigenes, a kegg pathway-based analysis was also performed. based on a comparison against the kegg database using blastx with an e-value cutoff of < <dig> e- <dig>   <dig>   of the  <dig>  unigenes had significant matches in the database and were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways. of the  <dig>  metabolism pathway unigenes,  <dig>  were involved in plant hormone signal transduction pathways, including tryptophan metabolism, zeatin biosynthesis, diterpenoid biosynthesis, carotenoid biosynthesis, cysteine and methionine metabolism, brassinosteroid biosynthesis, α-linolenic acid metabolism, and phenylalanine metabolism.

the three samples had  <dig> members in common when the  <dig> most abundant transcripts were compared . the  <dig> unique members highly expressed in the control were involved in auxin signaling, cell division, and biogenesis. in contrast, the  <dig> unique members highly expressed in the c <dig> sample were stress  -induced genes. the  <dig> unique members highly expressed in the f <dig> sample were also stress-related genes, e.g., the glucanase, zinc finger protein, and e <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligase genes. these results indicate that our data are reliable.

protein coding sequence prediction
unigenes were aligned by blastx  against the nr, swiss-prot, kegg, and cog protein databases in that order. unigenes aligned to a high priority database were not aligned to databases of lower priority. the process ended when all alignments had been performed. the correct reading frame of the nucleotide sequences  of unigenes was defined by the highest rank in the blast results, and the corresponding protein sequences were obtained from the standard codon table. unigenes that could not be aligned to any database were scanned with estscan  <cit>  to produce the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the predicted region. in total,  <dig>  unigene coding sequences  were generated by the blastx protein database searches described above. of these unigenes with cds sequences, the majority  were over 500 bp and  <dig>  were over  <dig>  000 bp in length . using the estscan program, we assigned another  <dig> unigene cdss that could not be aligned to above databases . the length frequency distributions of these unigene cdss and their corresponding amino acid sequences are given .figure  <dig>

differentially expressed gene among three samples
we measured gene expression levels based on fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads . after applying the chi-square test and benjamini-hochberg multiple testing corrections using r program among three samples simultaneously, we identified  <dig>  genes as reliable degs in at least two samples  regardless of fold change . of these degs,  <dig> were expressed differentially in all three samples . given a standard at an estimated absolute log2-fold change of > <dig>  the respective degs of ck vs. c <dig>  ck vs. f <dig> and c <dig> vs. f <dig> were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  . the number of up-regulated unigenes in c <dig> and f <dig> samples was  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively.

to accurately identify degs, we selected the  <dig> most significantly up-regulated transcripts that could be well-annotated by poplar database or nr database. as a result, those coding for the chlorophyll a/b binding protein , rubisco activase , ap2/erf transcription factors , and some other transcription factors  were the most up-regulated interpretable transcripts in c <dig> sample . as for the top  <dig> up-regulated transcripts in the f <dig> sample , the annotated transcripts focused on transcription factors  and xyloglucan endotransglycosylases .

although illumina sequencing is a highly efficient method for deg screening, false positives still occur because of the sensitivity of this technology to templates present in dna samples  <cit> . thus, we validated the rna sequencing data by performing qpcr analysis on  <dig> transcripts randomly selected from the up-regulated gene list. the qpcr results indicate that all of these degs exhibited similar expression kinetics to those obtained from the rna sequencing analysis . these results support the validity of the method used for determining degs from the rna sequencing analysis.figure  <dig> 
expression analyses of  <dig> degs by qpcr. qpcr was performed on  <dig> members randomly selected from up-regulated gene lists of the c <dig> or f <dig> sample.



gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses of differentially expressed unigenes
all degs were mapped to each term of the gene ontology database  and the gene numbers were calculated from each go term. using a hypergeometric test, we identified the significantly enriched go terms of degs compared to the genomic background . in the category of biological processes, three go terms including “response to stress”, “response to stimulus” and “response to carbohydrate stimulus” are enriched  after 4°c and -4°c treatments , suggesting that genes in these processes may play important roles in low temperature perception. additionally, “carbon fixation process”, “glucan metabolic process” and “macromolecule metabolic regulation processes” are also enriched for degs in c <dig> , indicating that genes related to these processes may also participate in cold sensing. a close inspection referred to “response to stimulus” category indicated that “response to hormone stimulus” and “response to abiotic stimulus” were two over-presented subcategories , suggesting our low temperature treatment may have caused an efficient abiotic stress and have activated some hormone response process. furthermore, degs with “protein binding” and “protein modification” subcategories were also over-presented in both samples, indicating that comprehensive changes had taken place in cells in response to low temperature stress. we further performed go enrichment analysis for genes that differentially expressed in all of three samples and the results indicated that those involved in gene expression regulation, macromolecule metabolic process regulation, and abiotic stimulus response were enriched. as for the category of “molecular function”, degs with “structural molecule activity” was the only common group that over-presented after 4°c and -4°c treatments .table  <dig>

by performing the kegg pathway analyses, we identified twelve pathways that changed significantly  under 4°c treatment, including the members involved in carbohydrate, energy, vitamin, hormone, and nitrogen metabolism . “plant pathogen interaction”, “hormone signal transduction”, and “biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty” pathways had the top three most differentially expressed unigene numbers and thus seem to play important roles in low temperature perception above freezing point. as for -4°c treatment, only  <dig> pathways changed significantly . “plant pathogen interaction” was assigned as a major pathway that changed significantly in both treated groups, indicating that low temperature stress response signal network may overlap with plant-pathogen interactions signals in p. euphratica. this is a notable finding considering that little is known about the overlap in signal transduction between abiotic and biotic stresses. additionally, the transcripts of all of unsaturated fatty acid pathway genes increased significantly in the c <dig> sample. this result is in accordance with previous reports that plants undergoing low temperature stress preferentially accumulate poly-unsaturated and unsaturated fatty acids, which enhance low temperature tolerance under chilling conditions  <cit> .

transcription factors responding to low temperature stress
transcription factors play crucial roles in the regulation of target gene expression via specific binding to cis-acting elements in their promoters  <cit> . many of the cor genes contain cis-elements, such as dehydration-responsive elements/c-repeat elements  and myeloblastosis   <cit>  in their promoters that can be regulated by dreb and myb transcription factors. analysis of these transcription factors could provide useful information on the complex regulatory networks involved in p. euphratica cold stress responses.

changes in the expression of transcription factors occurred both after 4°c and -4°c treatments . the ap2/erf transcription factors were overrepresented  in both treated samples. this family contains  <dig> and  <dig> up-regulated members in the c <dig> and f <dig> samples, respectively , indicating its important role in low temperature stress responses. the ap2/erf transcription factors have been subdivided into five subfamilies including ap <dig> subfamily, dreb subfamily, erf subfamily, rav subfamily and others. some rap homologs  and erf homologs , which were seldom studied in cold sensing were up-regulated in both c <dig> and f <dig> samples, indicating the potential function of these subfamilies in cold response. as a group of dreb subfamily, cbf/dreb <dig> was found to be expressed specifically under cold stress but not under normal growth conditions. here, several dreb1/cbf-like unigenes changed their expression significantly after low temperature treatments. the transcripts of two cbf4/dreb1d homologs, unigene <dig> and unigene <dig>  both increased over 11-fold after both treatments . however, no arabidopsis cbf <dig> homologs were found up-regulated in the p. euphratica transcriptome. thus, our results not only indicate a key role of the cbf/dreb <dig> transcription factors in low temperature responses but also suggest that the cbf/dreb <dig> transcriptional activation mechanism of p. euphratica is not necessarily the same as that of arabidopsis.table  <dig>

each transcription factor contains known dna-binding domains defined by the pfam database.



previous studies have shown that not all cold-regulated gene expression is under the direct control of the cbf/dreb family  <cit> . besides the ap2/erf family, it is likely that the wrky and nac transcription factors also play important roles in the transcriptional regulation of genes in early cold response in p. euphratica because they were overrepresented in the up-regulated gene list . in the wrky family,  <dig> and  <dig> members were up-regulated in the c <dig> and f <dig> groups, respectively . in comparison, none was found down-regulated in the respective groups. in the nac transcription factor family, the transcripts of  <dig> and  <dig> members were up-regulated, while none was found down-regulated in both treated samples. evidence that the wrky and nac transcription factor gene families may play important roles in the regulation of transcriptional reprogramming associated with cold stress responses is incremental . the role of several wrky genes, such as atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  hvwrky <dig>  and gmwrky <dig> , and several nac genes, such as tanac <dig>  ssnac <dig>  and osnac <dig>  <cit> , in plant cold response has been established. the overrepresentation  of these two transcription factor families in the up-regulated gene list may indicate their importance in p. euphratica cold perception.

it is notable that transcription factors occupied about 20% members  in top  <dig> up-regulated gene lists . however, our analysis also showed that some transcription factors were not always up-regulated. for example, hd-zip transcription factors from both samples were found down-regulated. some down-regulated members were also identified in c3h and bhlh families. according to previous reports, the bhlh family is involved in long term responses to low temperatures  <cit> . some ice1-like bhlh transcription factors may be involved in cbf regulation  <cit> . here, several members of this transcription factor family have altered their expression in c <dig> sample but not in f <dig> sample. it seems likely that some bhlh transcription factors may play important roles in response of low temperature stress above freezing point. these results imply that the mechanism by which these genes mediate low temperature perception is complex.

photosystem response to low temperature
the eventual effect of an abiotic stress on plant growth not only depends on the extent of the damage, but also on the capacity for recovery after the damage occurs  <cit> . cold-tolerant plants usually show a lower decrease in the rates of photosynthetic electron transport and photosynthetic carbon metabolism  <cit> . these changes facilitate better recovery from chilling stress in these plants compared with cold-sensitive genotypes  <cit> .

go enrichment results showed that “carbon fixation” was one of the main biological processes after 4°c treatment. it was consistent with the over-representation of numbers of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase  genes  <cit>  listed in the top  <dig> up-regulated unigenes of c <dig> sample. however, none was found in the top  <dig> up-regulated unigenes of f <dig> sample. thus, we conclude that the expression elevation of rubisco genes under low temperature below freezing point may be part of an adaptive mechanism that promotes p. euphratica survival.

chilling-induced photoinhibition and subsequent recovery has been studied in maize. no changes or even increases in the photosystem i  activity have been observed  <cit> . as for the photosystem ii  system, an increase in proportion of its inactive centers and a lower capacity for repair of its damaged centers were observed and these changes were assumed to have led to persistent depression of photosynthetic efficiency  <cit> . according to our data, a number of genes encoding photosystem i or ii protein complexes exhibited up-regulation under 4°c treatment, while only a few of them up-regulated after -4°c treatment. differential expression patterns of photosystem genes in the c <dig> and f <dig> samples suggest that photosystem could percept low temperature above but not below freezing point. this result is consistent with the findings that the photosystm of cold-acclimated plants was less affected than that of the nonacclimated plants  <cit> .

aba signal transduction components in p. euphratica cold response
current evidence suggests that multiple mechanisms are involved in activating the cold-acclimation response. both aba-dependent and -independent pathways could regulate cold-responsive genes. aba is an important stress hormone that mediates abiotic stress responses in plants  <cit> . plants grown under cold stress may experience altered hormone homeostasis and/or signal transduction  <cit> . chen et al.  <cit>  found that aba levels increased in cold-treated plants. the exogenous application of aba at normal temperature has been found to enhance the freezing tolerance and thus aid in cold-acclimation in several plant species. however, whether aba has a fundamental role in cold sensing and cold responsive network is unresolved.

to investigate whether aba is involved in cold perception, we first investigated expression patterns of aba biosynthesis genes annotated by nr or poplar transcript annotation. sharp increase in fold-change of two unigenes  encoding the key rate-limiting enzymes of aba synthesis  were observed in both samples  <cit> . these results are consistent with those obtained in arabidopsis in previous studies, suggesting that aba biosynthesis may be involved in cold response  <cit> . recently, clade a protein phosphatases type 2c  function as key negative regulators of aba signaling by interacting with aba receptors has been established  <cit> . here, all candidate pp2c genes identified in c <dig> and f <dig> samples showed an up-regulated expression pattern . taken together, our results suggest aba may function as an important mediator of low temperature perception and promoter of chilling and freezing tolerance in p. euphratica.

calcium signal transduction components in p. euphratica cold response
as a second universal messenger involved in abiotic stress responses in plants, there is increasing evidence that calcium functions as an important messenger in a low temperature signal transduction pathway  <cit> . in arabidopsis, cytoplasmic calcium levels increase rapidly in response to low temperatures, largely due to an influx of calcium from extracellular stores  <cit> . calcium signals are perceived by calcium sensors that relay the signals into downstream targets such as phosphorylation cascades and gene expression regulation  <cit> . three major families of ca2+ sensors function in abiotic stress responses in higher plants: calmodulins  and cam-like proteins, calcineurin b-like  proteins, and calcium-dependent protein kinases   <cit> . cams and cbls are small proteins that transmit the ca2+ signal by interacting with target proteins and regulating their activity. cdpks are monomeric proteins containing a cam-like domain with four ef-hand motifs  <cit> .

to investigate whether these ca2+ sensor are involved in cold perception of p. euphratica, we searched for calcium related genes in differentially expressed gene list. as a result, we have found  <dig> members including cdpk homologs, calmodulin -binding protein genes, cbl-interacting protein kinases , and ca2+-atpase up-regulated . only  <dig> of them showed down-regulated after 4°c treatment. as for -4°c treatment,  <dig> out of  <dig> calcium related genes showed up-regulated while only  <dig> were down-regulated . these results are consistent with previous studies on arabidopsis and rice showing that low temperature enhances the gene expression of ca2+ sensors such as ca2+-atpase, cams, and cdpks  <cit> . surprisingly, none of ca2+ sensors from the cbl family showed up-regulated in both samples although most of its target kinases  were up-regulated. given that the overexpression of cbl <dig> could result in attenuation of cbf/dreb induction  <cit> , we speculate that the negative regulatory mechanism of cbl in cold perception may exist in p. euphratica. the complex cold responsive network composed of cbl calcium sensors and their target kinases require detailed analysis at the molecular level. our results indicate that ca2+ binding proteins are one of the signaling components induced at early stages of low temperature stress.

CONCLUSIONS
p. euphratica is a perennial desert tree with a high capacity for low temperature resistance compared with other poplar species  <cit> . here, we profiled the p. euphratica transcriptome under low temperature treatments in order to understand cold perception in this species. we obtained  <dig>  assembled unigenes using the trinity de novo assembly method and identified numerous potential cold sensing transcription factor genes and various key signal transduction components at the transcriptome level. these data provide useful resources for gene mining to improve low temperature stress tolerance in plants. our results indicate not only that the cbf orthologs play key roles, but also that unsaturated fatty acids, aba and calcium signaling components underlie a rapid and flexible cold response mechanism in p. euphratica. compared with transient chilling stress response, fewer genes were found to have altered expression under temperature below freezing point. particularly, only  <dig> pathways  clustered significantly with dges under freezing treatment. taken together, our results provide valuable information on the molecular adaptation of p. euphratica to low temperature stress.
