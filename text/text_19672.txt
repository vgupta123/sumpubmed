BACKGROUND
the probability of release  is a fundamental property of synapses that is regulated by presynaptic activity   <cit>  and by modulatory transmitters acting on presynaptic receptors  <cit> . pr at rest  varies substantially among synapses  <cit>  and is determined by two independent factors. one is the number of vesicles primed for release and thus potentially available for release by a single action potential, the primed pool. the other is the probability of releasing one primed vesicle   <cit> . repeated activation at short intervals, resulting in residual elevated calcium in the presynaptic terminal between activations, will change pves, rapidly deplete the primed pool, and prime new vesicles in a calcium-dependent manner  <cit> . during high-frequency activation pr is rather determined by the rate at which new vesicles can become available for release  <cit> . thus, factors determining pr differ depending on whether the presynaptic terminal has been recently active, or not, and modulatory transmitters may modulate pr differently when synapses are active compared to following a period of rest  <cit> .

we have found that activation of astrocytes by a short synaptic burst negatively modulates release probability at ca3-ca <dig> glutamate synapses  <cit> . from a period of hundreds of milliseconds to seconds after a short synaptic burst, pr is reduced in the recently active synapses . this pbd is absent when strongly buffering calcium in the astrocyte gap junction-coupled network, when inhibiting astrocyte metabolism and early in development when the astrocyte network still not has gained its mature function. this short-term astrocyte-mediated depression is also observed as a reduction of pr in inactive neighboring synapses   <cit> . although pr is depressed in the pbd and in thesd it is unclear if these depressions are based on the same mechanism. one obvious difference between the pbd and the thesd is the recent presynaptic activity. in the present study we have therefore compared the pbd and the thesd with respect to estimated changes in pves and primed pool.

RESULTS
pbd and thesd are associated with different changes in the paired-pulse ratio
a relatively modest conditioning, a 3-impulse  synaptic burst, in the hippocampal ca <dig> area, results in a substantial short-term homosynaptic  and heterosynaptic  transient astrocyte-mediated depression, respectively, half a second after the conditioning burst  <cit> . the experimental protocol for the pbd and the thesd is schematically shown in figure 1a. our standard protocol consisted of a 3-impulse,  <dig> hz, burst,  <dig> milliseconds before a paired-pulse test stimulus applied either homosynaptically , or heterosynaptically  every  <dig> seconds . the control for the heterosynaptic depression was the paired-pulse test preceded  <dig> s before with a 3-impulse  synaptic burst, every protocol was repeated  <dig> times.

these two astrocyte-mediated depressions were both associated with increased paired-pulse ratio , but to different extent. we will use a change in ppr in association with the astrocyte-mediated depressions as an indication of a change in pr  <cit>   since we previously have shown that that the pbd is also associated an equal depression reported by the ampa and by the nmda epscs, as well as by a matching decrease in the 1/cv <dig>  <cit> . here, we first wanted to, in more detail, examine the relationship between the depression and the increased ppr for the pbd and thesd, respectively. under our experimental conditions , the ppr was about  <dig> , both when  <dig> ms or  <dig> ms was used as interstimulus interval . the ppr increased to about  <dig> in association with the thesd, but only to about  <dig>  in association with the pbd , despite the fact that the pbd was expressed as a substantially larger depression of the field epsp  than the thesd  .

the large increase of the ppr associated with the thesd indicates that the second fepsp in the test paired-pulse protocol should be little affected. indeed, there was no change of the second fepsp in association with the thesd . using a 3-impulse  <dig> hz test stimulus  we found that also the third fepsp of this 3- impulse test stimulus was not depressed . this result indicates that the depression of pr in association with the thesd is selective for stimuli that occur following a period of rest. in marked contrast to the thesd, the second fepsp in the test paired-pulse protocol was significantly depressed in association with the pbd  . the differential relationship between the amount of depression and the change of the ppr for the pbd and thesd, respectively, suggests that different mechanisms are involved in reducing pr, raising the question how the pbd and thesd may interact.

occlusion between pbd and thesd
to test for interaction between the pbd and the thesd we applied the 3-impulse burst simultaneously to the two synaptic inputs  and compared the depression of the fepsp  <dig> ms later to the pbd in the same experiment. as demonstrated in figure 2a the addition of the 3-impulse burst to the other synaptic input did not increase the amount of depression compared to the control pbd, indicating that the homosynaptic conditioning fully elicits the type of depression elicited by the heterosynaptic conditioning . alternatively, recent synaptic activity renders synapses resistant to the type of depression elicited by the heterosynaptic conditioning. we next tested to elicit hetero- and homosynaptic depression sequentially by first applying the heterosynaptic conditioning and then,  <dig> ms later, the homosynaptic conditioning . the heterosynaptic conditioning elicited a depression of  <dig> ± 6%  of the fepsp, associated with an increased ppr of  <dig> ± 10%   . the additional homosynaptic conditioning increased the depression to  <dig> ± 3%,  but reduced the increase of the ppr to  <dig> ± 8%  . these interaction experiments suggest that the homosynaptic pbd consist of two components reducing pr, one in common with inactive synapses and one specific for recently active synapses. the depression component specific for the homosynaptic conditioning is associated with decreased ppr, possibly related to facilitation/augmentation induced concomitantly with depletion of primed vesicles by the homosynaptic conditioning.

to elucidate how the homosynaptic and heterosynaptic depressions interact we compared a multiplicative, and an additive relationship with the actual data. in these experiments the average actual pbd was  <dig> ± 3% . an additive relationship between the thesd and the remaining depression in the subsequent pbd predicts a total pbd of  <dig>  ±  <dig> . a multiplicative relationship predicts a total pbd of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . thus, these calculations suggest that a multiplicative interaction and an additive interaction both represent the data reasonable well, but they do not distinguish between the two models.

pbd is associated with a decreased pool of primed vesicles
in contrast to the thesd, which was associated with a selective depression of the first epsp, also the second epsp in the paired-pulse protocol was reduced in the pbd . to further examine the consequences of homosynaptic conditioning we used a train of  <dig> action potentials  as a test stimulus, and used whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings to monitor the responses . under these conditions the 3-impulse conditioning burst caused a depression of the first epsc in the train by  <dig> ± 4% , which is somewhat larger than the depression observed using field recordings and a 2-impulse test stimulus . as shown in figure 3c, not only the first and second epsc were depressed, but also the third and fourth, whereas the last six epscs in the test train were largely unaffected. increasing the number of stimuli in the conditioning burst to  <dig> extended the depression of the test train to all synaptic responses . a direct comparison of the depressions caused by 3- and 10-impulse conditioning shows that, whereas the 10-impulse conditioning causes an overall larger depression, the depression of the first epsc  is about the same in these two situations   <cit> .

the overall response during train stimulation can be used to estimate the relative number of primed vesicles available for release at the onset of the train stimulation  <cit> . the rationale behind this estimation is that these vesicles are rapidly consumed by the first few stimuli in the train and priming of new vesicles starts rapidly in the presence of elevated intraterminal calcium. when pre-primed vesicles are consumed and the activity-dependent priming is fully developed, pr per stimulus becomes rather constant because the release is matched by the rate of new priming. by plotting the cumulative epsc amplitude  as a function of stimulus number , the relative priming rate can be estimated as the slope of the linear late part of the cumulative epsc - stimulus number relationship. this analysis indicated that the activity-dependent priming rate was unaffected by the 3-impulse conditioning  , whereas it was reduced by the 10-impulse conditioning  .

the number of  vesicles available for release at the onset of the train stimulation can be estimated by subtracting the contribution from activity-dependent priming  of new vesicles from the total response during the train. the relative magnitude of the estimate of the pre-primed pool will then depend on when during the train stimulation recruitment is assumed to start. assuming full recruitment rate already at the first stimulus in the train, an estimate of the pre-primed pool of vesicles can be obtained by the value of the extrapolated regression line at the first stimulus. with this representation of the pre-primed pool, we observed a reduction by  <dig> ±  <dig> %  following the 3-impulse conditioning and by  <dig> ± 4%  following the 10-impulse conditioning. these values are most certainly an overestimate of the depression since the method of back extrapolating will underestimate the pre-primed pool size . nevertheless, this analysis indicates that the pbd is associated with a reduction of the pre-primed pool of vesicles and that this reduction increases when increasing the number of stimuli in the conditioning train.

a possible explanation for the similar magnitude of the pbd following a conditioning burst of  <dig> and  <dig> impulses  is that the smaller pool  following the  <dig> impulse conditioning is compensated for by an increased pves, i.e. facilitation/augmentation  <cit> , thereby maintaining pr  <cit> . a burst consisting of 3- <dig> impulses, and of  <dig> impulses at  <dig> hz have previously been shown to elicit an augmentation at these ca3-ca <dig> synapses  of about 108% and 124% of control, respectively, two seconds after the burst  <cit> . if an increased facilitation/augmentation counteracts an increased depletion, one would expect that the pbd following the 10-impulse conditioning should be associated with a smaller ppr than the pbd following the 3-impulse conditioning, since facilitation/augmentation is associated with pronounced decrease in ppr  <cit> . consistent with a larger depletion  and a larger facilitation/augmentation  the ppr was indeed smaller after the 10-impulse , than after the 3-impulse , conditioning .

the results so far indicate that pbd is a variable mixture of three different forms of short-term plasticity; the astrocyte-mediated depression of "resting pves", facilitation/augmentation and depletion of primed vesicles. since these three forms short-term plasticity are associated with qualitatively very different changes in ppr, an analysis of the changes in ppr might be an alternative approach to estimate the reduction in the size of the primed vesicle pool by the homosynaptic conditioning. figure 4a illustrates the relationship between changes in synaptic efficacy and changes in ppr for pbds and thesds. since these changes are expressed as ratios they are plotted on logarithmic scales. changes in pr solely based on a change in the pool of primed vesicles are expected to affect epsp <dig> and epsp <dig> about equally and thus not result in changes of the ppr  <cit> , as indicated by the green line. changes in pr based solely on a change in "resting pves" are, on the other hand, expected to only affect epsp <dig> thus resulting in reciprocal changes of the ppr, as indicated by the blue line. as discussed above, the thesd  is a depression of "resting pves" and its coordinates also fall close to the green line. when astrocyte metabolism was inhibited by fac  <cit>  the same conditioning stimuli results in no depression and no change in ppr . the coordinates for facilitation , and likely augmentation  <cit> , are also close to the green line, indicating that astrocyte-mediated depression of "resting pves" and facilitation/augmentation cause reciprocal changes of synaptic efficacy and ppr. the coordinates for pbd elicited by a 3-impulse burst , by a 10-impulse burst  and by a 3-impulse burst when astrocyte signaling was inhibited  by either intracellular calcium chelation, or metabolic inhibition, are all relatively close to the green line.

to estimate how much a reduction in the pool contributes to the pbd elicited by a 3-impulse burst , we assume that the three different short-term plasticities  multiply up to a net pbd. if "resting pves" depression and facilitation/augmentation only occur in separate synapses  one should instead have assumed an additive relationship. however, the quantitative difference between a multiplicative and additive relationship is not large using relevant magnitudes of these plasticities. for example, if "resting pves" reduces synaptic efficacy to  <dig>  and if facilitation/augmentation increases synaptic efficacy to  <dig>  their combined action should be  <dig>  using the multiplicative relationship and  <dig>  using the additive relationship. the relationship between pves and vesicle pool is likely sub-multiplicative  <cit> , but for rather small absolute values of pves and vesicle pool, and rather small changes in these parameters, a multiplicative relationship is a reasonable approximation. for example, if pves is  <dig>  and the number of primed, release ready, vesicles is  <dig>  a reduction by a factor  <dig> of both these parameters will reduce pr from  <dig>  to  <dig>   using the sub-multiplicative relationship and from  <dig>  to  <dig>   using the multiplicative relationship, an error by about 4%.

based on the increase of ppr in association with the thesd  of control, figure 1) and the full occlusion between the thesd and the pbd , we first estimate that the "resting pves" depression contributes with  <dig>  of control  to the pbd elicited by a 3-impulse burst . since ppr associated with the pbd was  <dig>  ±  <dig> , n =  <dig> of control and "resting pves" depression should contribute by  <dig> , facilitation/augmentation should contribute with a reduction in ppr by  <dig>  , and an facilitation/augmentation associated with a ppr of  <dig>  of control should correspond to an increase of the first epsp  by  <dig>  . having estimated the contribution from "resting pves" depression  and from facilitation/augmentation  we estimated the contribution from depletion as the total pbd  divided by the product  <dig>  and  <dig> , yielding a value of  <dig>  of control .

using the same calculation we found that the estimated contribution of depletion to the pbd following the 10-impulse burst  had increased to  <dig>  . with this method based on relative changes in ppr to estimate the depletion we thus find that depletion is 44% larger following the 10-impulse burst compared to that following the 3-impulse burst. this increased depletion is somewhat smaller, but comparable, to the increase we found using the method of cumulative burst response .

compromising astrocyte signaling using either intracellular calcium chelation, or inhibition of the citric acid cycle resulted in a blockade of the pbd  <cit> . in fact, a small potentiation of  <dig>   of control associated with a decrease of the ppr to  <dig>   of control remained . since the "resting pves" depression is expected to be to totally blocked under these conditions  facilitation/augmentation alone should account for the change in ppr, that is,  <dig>  . the estimated depletion under these conditions should then be  <dig>  , that is, substantially smaller than when astrocyte signaling was intact .

discussion
the present study has examined how astrocyte-mediated short-term depression affects release probability at glutamate synapses in the ca <dig> hippocampal region. our main conclusions are that activation of astrocytes decreases vesicular release probability at inactive synapses , but not at active synapses , and impose a delay in the recovery of primed vesicles following depletion by high-frequency activity.

depression of "resting pves", but not "active pves"
the thesd was associated with a selective depression of the first epsp in a paired-pulse, or a high-frequency burst, protocol. the second and third epsp evoked at  <dig> hz were not depressed, but, if anything, slightly increased . this finding cannot be explained by a reduction in the number of release-ready  vesicles, or by a general reduction in pves, both of which are not expected to be restricted to only the first epsp. it is also not consistent with reduced calcium influx which affects both epsps  evoked by a paired-pulse stimulus . to explain the selective depression of the first epsp we propose that "resting" and "active" pves are differentially modulated such that astrocyte-mediated depression selectively affects "resting pves". this proposal is in line with the finding that, although there is a large heterogeneity among developing hippocampal glutamate synapses regarding "resting pves", "active pves" is rather uniform among these synapses  <cit> .

although we are not aware of any previous description of pr modulation restricted to "resting pves", this behavior is strikingly similar to the change in synaptic transmission produced by genetic elimination of the rab3a-d  <cit> . hippocampal synapses from these mice showed about 30% reduction in pr when tested with low frequency, but little, or no, reduction of pr when tested at high frequency. these findings from the rab3-deficient mice indicated that rab3s are involved in "superpriming" of vesicles in a subset of synapses  <cit> . synapses with "superprimed" vesicles may well correspond to the subpopulation of high-pr synapses among the ca3-ca <dig> synapses  <cit> . thus, a possible explanation for the thesd would be an astrocyte-mediated reversal of rab3-dependent "superpriming" at high-pr synapses. according to the time-course of thesd  <cit>  this putative reversal of "superpriming" would develop during a few hundred ms and vanish within a few seconds.

a combination of depression of "resting pves", depletion of vesicles and augmentation during the pbd
the interaction between hetero- and homosynaptic conditioning indicated that the homosynaptic pbd consists of two separable components . one component is shared with the thesd and should then be expressed as a depression of "resting pves" and an increased ppr, possibly related to reversal of rab3-dependent "superpriming" at high-pr synapses. the other component is then specific for recently active synapses and seems to involve depletion of vesicles, contributing to further depression, and facilitation/augmentation, counteracting the depression.

that the conditioning burst causes depletion of vesicles available for release by the subsequent test stimulation was indicated by the analysis of the cumulative test train response . another analysis, based on changes in ppr , supported this conclusion. this analysis was based on the premises that facilitation/augmentation is associated with decreased ppr  <cit>  whereas depletion is associated with no, or very small, changes of ppr  <cit> .

the presence of facilitation/augmentation was indicated by reduced ppr  associated with the component of the pbd specific for the homosynaptic conditioning . in addition to the potentiation per se, facilitation/augmentation may contribute to counteract the depression  and to the decreased ppr in another way. since facilitation/augmentation implies a shift from "resting pves" to "active pves", it will render synapses expressing it resistant to the astrocyte-mediated depression of "resting pves". this scenario presupposes that facilitation/augmentation and the astrocyte-mediated depression of "resting pves" can be expressed in the same synapse. as will be outlined below, this is, however, not likely the case. augmentation is typically expressed at low-pr synapses and appears to rather specifically potentiate only the first epsc in a high-frequency train, i.e. "resting pves",  <cit>  and is thus associated with a prominent decrease of the ppr  <cit> . the magnitude of augmentation increases with increased number of stimuli in the conditioning high-frequency stimulation, but its decay time constant is characteristically remarkably invariable, being 5- <dig> s  <cit> . although it remains to be determined with more accuracy, the decay time constant of the astrocyte-mediated depression of "resting pves" is in the order of about  <dig> s  <cit> , possibly explaining the finding that facilitation/augmentation is larger  <dig> s, compared to  <dig> s, following a conditioning burst  <cit> . this finding is not consistent with astrocyte-mediated depression of "resting pves" and augmentation occurring in the same synapses since, if they were, facilitation/augmentation would have precluded the expression of the "resting pves" depression. in support for the idea that these two short-term synaptic plasticities occur in separate synapses our results indicated that, whereas facilitation/augmentation increased when increasing the number of stimuli in the conditioning train from  <dig> to  <dig>  the depression of "resting pves" did not increase, but remained at the same magnitude. as discussed above it is likely that augmentation occurs at low-pr synapses while astrocyte-mediated depression of "resting pves" occurs at high-pr synapses.

we thus favor a scenario in which the conditioning burst elicits three different forms of short-term synaptic plasticity; a depression of "resting pves" , facilitation/augmentation of "resting pves"  and depletion of primed vesicles at all synapses. the relative contribution of these different forms of short-term plasticity will depend on the nature of the conditioning stimuli, on the conditioning - test interval, as well as on the relative number of low pr synapses in the synapse population.

astrocyte signaling imposes a delay in the recovery of primed vesicles
we have previously shown that inhibiting astrocyte metabolism and calcium signaling prevents the thesd and the pbd  <cit> . when analyzed in some more detail here , the prevention of the pbd was associated with decreased ppr, indicating the presence of facilitation/augmentation sufficient to just oppose depletion. further analysis indicated that the depletion component was substantially reduced compared to the control situation, when astrocyte signaling was intact. the inhibition of astrocyte signaling did not affect the magnitude conditioning burst response, indicating that the size of pre-primed pool of vesicles as well as the depletion of vesicles per se by the conditioning burst is unaffected by astrocyte signaling. therefore, to explain the larger pool  <dig>  s after a conditioning burst we propose that recovery from depletion is faster when astrocyte signaling is inhibited, or conversely, that an astrocyte signal impose a delay of the re-priming following depletion. this proposal has a precedent from results at the calyx of held synapse at which activation of metabotropic glutamate autoreceptors slowed down the recovery after the burst, while not affecting the response during the continuous high-frequency activation  <cit> . to what extent activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors is involved in the astrocyte-mediated delay of re-priming after a conditioning burst will be examined in future studies.

recovery of primed vesicles is thought to be mediated by a fast calcium-dependent  and a slow calcium-independent  mechanism  <cit> . increased presynaptic calcium concentration accelerates recovery of primed vesicles  <cit> . this mechanism relies on calmodulin  <cit>  binding to munc- <dig>  <cit> , and is counteracted by presynaptic gabab receptor activation reducing presynaptic camp levels  <cit> . since the recruitment rate during a 10-impulse,  <dig> hz, train following a 3-impulse burst was unaffected  it is unlikely that the presently proposed astrocyte-mediated delay of vesicle recovery acts by directly inhibiting the calcium-dependent priming. therefore we propose that astrocyte signaling rather acts by slowing down calcium-independent recruitment, or by accelerating the decay of the calcium-dependent recruitment when stimulation stops . as calcium-dependent recruitment can be modulated by the levels of camp  <cit>  a putative glio-transmitter could mediate an acceleration of fast recruitment-decay by binding to a metabotropic receptor and decrease camp  <cit> .

functional considerations
our results suggest that a short burst activation of astrocytes results in a transient depression of "resting pves" and a delay in the replenishment of primed vesicles after depletion. we propose that other mechanisms controlling pr, such as "active pves", calcium-dependent recruitment and the size of release-ready primed vesicles, are not affected by the astrocyte signaling. these considerations may help to explain during which type of synaptic activity astrocyte-mediated short-term synaptic depression is operating. thus, conditions during which there is residual calcium in the terminal, resulting in "active pves" and calcium-dependent recruitment of new vesicles, are expected to preclude astrocyte-mediated depression. in line with this we found that continuous high-frequency trains were unaffected by inhibition of astrocyte signaling. we also found that continuous low-frequency trains were unaffected by inhibition of astrocyte signaling  <cit> . this finding is likely rather explained by insufficient temporal summation to activate the astrocytes. on the other hand, astrocyte-mediated short-term synaptic depression is expected to be prominently expressed during burst activity resembling theta burst activity   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that activated astrocytes depress the release probability via two different mechanisms; by depression of vesicular release probability only at inactive synapses and by imposing a delay in the recovery of the primed pool of vesicles following depletion. these mechanisms restrict the expression of the astrocyte-mediated depression to temporal windows that are typical for synaptic burst activity.
