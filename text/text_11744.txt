BACKGROUND
the naked mole rats  are mouse-sized subterranean rodents native to east africa  <cit> . they have an exceptional set of physiological traits that make them adapt to living in the underground of droughty desert. they are becoming one of the most extraordinary organisms known to science  <cit> .

nmrs are the longest-lived rodent known till now and their maximum lifespan can be up to thirty years  <cit> . by contrast, other similar-sized rodents such as mouse possess a life expectancy of only four years, which is far less than that of nmr. previously published studies have indicated that the longevity of nmr was possibly because of the negligible decrement of age-related physiological characteristic along with their lifetime, such as declining fertility and mortality rate  <cit> .

besides delayed senescence, nmrs are remarkably resistant to both congenital and experimentally induced cancer genesis  <cit> . cancer is a group of complex polygenic diseases that commonly affect lots of vertebrates, and is constantly considered to be an inevitable accompanied by senescence. cancer is the second dominant cause of mortality in the world, which cause  <dig>  million of death estimated by world health organization  <cit> . it has been recognized for quite a long time that cancer genesis is closely related to tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes  <cit> . identifying the function of the added genes may bring us in another way to explore the regulatory network of the cancer process. in addition, the mechanisms of cancer resistance present in nmr are not thoroughly clear. thus, identification of nmr genes closely implicated in cancer may provide us effective clues for delineating causes of cancer proneness and studying anti-cancer properties for mammalian organisms.

nmrs possess several other special physiological characteristics as well. although nmrs belong to the order of rodentia, they are actually poikilothermal animals whose body temperatures vary continuously following the environment  <cit> . furthermore, nmrs are insensitive to certain types of pain  <cit>  and acid  <cit> , and are well adapted to the underground surrounding at an extremely low oxygen concentration   <cit> .

recently, using high-throughput next generation sequencing techniques, the genome of nmr has been sequenced. these excellent resources provide great opportunities for understanding the exceptional characteristics of nmr and improve biological and biomedical studies. previously, some genes have been identified to be related to some of these unusual characteristics, e.g., the telomerase reverse transcriptase  gene and some other genes, which may be involved in extended longevity mechanisms of nmr  <cit> . however, investigation of the genomic information of nmr at a systems-biology level is still lacking, which may provide additional information to uncover the molecular mechanisms for the extraordinary traits  of nmr.

in this paper, a comparative genomics study was carried out to explore the genes that were either common between rat and nmr, or specific to each of them. we divided these genes into three groups: common genes, genes only present in nmr and genes only present in rat. we then used the pfam database to identify the events of gain or loss of different protein families between these two species. in addition, the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database was used to study the rat pathways in which the nmr-missing genes participate. a significant number of these genes were found to be enriched in the pathways related to the exceptional characteristics of nmr , many of which have been previously reported to be associated with various cancers. finally, we analyzed the sequence variations  of orthologous proteins to investigate the potentially expressional and/or functional alternations of them between rat and nmr. overall, our data not only help unveil the cancer resistance mechanisms of nmr but provide insights into identifying new cancer-related genes.

methods
genome, database and resources
the complete set of annotated rat and nmr protein sequences were obtained from the uniprot database . for those genes with alternative splicing variants, proteins with the smallest pe value  and the longest length were chosen to represent the gene-encoding protein sequences. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> proteins corresponding to their genes were finally obtained for rat and nmr, respectively.

the file containing the whole pathways of rat was downloaded from the kegg database . the online mendelian inheritance in man  database  was used to analyze the relationship between cancers and human orthologs of genes absent in nmr. furthermore, the expression data of these genes in rat tissues were obtained from the gene expression atlas  database , which was used to identify whether or not the expression levels of these genes were related to cancer development.

identification of orthologous genes between rat and nmr
to analyze the orthologous gene pairs between rat and nmr, we employed the complete set of annotated proteins of one organism as queries to search for orthologs in the other species via blastp with a cut-off of e-value ≤ 1e- <dig>  orthologous genes were further defined as bidirectional best hits.

on the basis of identified orthologs between rat and nmr, we dissected all the genes into three classifications:

 class i: the shared genes, which were shared between rat and nmr;

 class ii: the nmr-missing genes, which were absent in nmr but present in rat;

 class iii: the nmr unique genes, which were found in nmr but missing in rat.

pfam analysis
considering that the conserved domains in a protein could provide information for its function and evolutionary dynamics, we used the pfam database  <cit>  , which collected a large collection of protein families, to search for gain or loss events of different protein families between these two species.

all the proteins of rat and nmr were searched against pfam database with a cut-off of e-value ≤ 1e- <dig>  for each protein, if two or more pfam families were available, only the one with the smallest e-value was selected. the number of each protein family in rat and nmr was then calculated respectively.

kegg pathway analysis of class ii genes
we further dissected the pathways containing class ii genes using the kegg database resource, which is a collection of manually curated pathway maps according to current knowledge on protein-protein interactions  <cit> .

first, each gene of class ii was mapped to their pathways. the p-value of the enrichment of nmr-missing genes in each pathway was then calculated by hypergeometric distribution test. moreover, considering that kegg pathways were composed of nodes which were actually modules including single gene or multiple functionally similar genes, we further analyzed the number and percentage of the nodes containing class ii genes in each of the enriched pathways.

sequence variation analysis of class i genes
although class i genes were considered as orthologous genes between rat and nmr, sequence variations had been previously observed for certain proteins. for example, the glutathione peroxidase  <dig> , which is highly expressed in mouse liver and kidney, has an early stop codon in nmr. such a variation results in the lack of the c-terminal part and may be related to an order of magnitude lower activity in nmr tissues  <cit> . thus, it would be useful to further study the orthologous genes between the two organisms for potential changes with regard to their function and/or regulation.

to systematically investigate such deletion or insertion events, we analyzed the blastp sequence alignment results for each class i gene in nmr, and focused on gap-related parameters, such as alignment length, number of mismatches, and percentage of identical matches, to calculate the lengths of sequence insertions/deletions. protein pairs of rat and nmr proteins were chosen at a cut-off of gap length> <dig> and percentage of mismatches <10%. to avoid incorrect protein annotation of nmr, the nmr proteins with significant fragment deletion were searched against the nmr genome using tblastn for further verification of the absence of these segments. finally, all selected proteins were searched against the conserved domains database  to identify their functional domains.

RESULTS
distribution of orthologous genes in rat and nmr
pfam analysis of rat and nmr genes
all the annotated proteins of rat and nmr were searched against pfam database  for the classification into different protein families.  <dig> and  <dig> protein families  were obtained in rat and nmr, respectively, indicating that the two species shared almost the same protein families.

we further analyzed the gain or loss events for each protein family in nmr. table  <dig> shows the top  <dig> families sorted by the number of expanded genes  in nmr. among them, two distinct cancer-related protein families: "melanoma-associated antigen family" and "mortality factor  <dig> families" had significant gene expansion in nmr. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> genes were found for the two families respectively in nmr, which were  <dig> and  <dig> more than those in rat. besides, several other families shown in table  <dig> have also been reported to be related to cancer, such as the protein kinase c  family and several heat shock proteins .

the pfam families were sorted by the expanded number of protein families. in this table, we only showed the top  <dig> families.

the pkc family, which possessed  <dig> proteins in nmr, had variable roles in tumour biology depending on the intracellular localizations and cell types. pkcs were generally abnormally regulated in the cancers of the breast, prostate, kidney and liver  <cit> , and remained as a possible target for cancer prevention and therapy  <cit> . here, a total of  <dig> additional pkc members were identified in nmr, implying that these new pkcs may play an important role in preventing nmr from cancer.

hsp proteins are a group of functionally related proteins regulating protein folding and unfolding reactions. hsp <dig> proteins were reported to be overexpressed in the malignant melanoma  <cit> . on the other hand, hsp <dig> proteins were also implicated to be involved in breast cancer progression because of its overexpression in breast cancer cell lines and association with survival of breast cancer  <cit> . thus, hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> proteins have been considered as the useful targets for cancer therapy  <cit> . in this study, the significant expansions of members of these two families in nmr were consistent with their potential roles in cancer prevention and may provide clues for the anti-cancer trait of nmr.

the pfam families were sorted by the contracted number of protein families. in this table, we only showed the top  <dig> families.

pathway analysis of nmr-missing genes
among  <dig> rat pathways in the kegg database,  <dig> of them were found to be significantly  enriched by the nmr-missing genes  . for example, at least  <dig> rat genes  in the "neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction" pathway were not detected in nmr. the loss of these genes might be one of the major reasons why nmr is insensitive to pain and acid  <cit> . in addition, nmr-missing genes were also significantly enriched in two known cancer pathways, "bladder cancer" and "pathways in cancer" .

*: in this table, we only showed the pathways with p-value≤ <dig> .

among the rest of pathways shown in table  <dig> five of them were thought to be cancer-related, which include "cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction"  <cit> , "p <dig> signalling pathway" <cit> , "apoptosis", "natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity"  <cit> , "wnt signalling pathway"  <cit> " and "notch signalling pathway"  <cit> . it is possible that several of these nmr-missing genes are associated with cancer development in other mammals including humans and could be considered as candidate cancer-related genes.

as kegg pathways are composed of nodes which may have single or multiple functionally similar genes, we also calculated the percentage of the nodes which contain at least one nmr-missing gene in each of these pathways, and obtained almost the same enriched pathways, such as "pathways in cancer", "neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction" and "oxidative phosphorylation", implying that the pathway enrichment of nmr-missing genes was significant at both gene and node levels .

analysis of cancer-related genes that were absent in nmr
to investigate the potential mechanisms of the anti-cancer aspects of nmr, three cancer-related pathways, including "pathways in cancer", "mapk  signalling pathway" and "wnt signalling pathway", were chosen as examples for further analysis.

1) pathways in cancer
twenty-nine genes in this pathway were not detected in nmr . these genes were found to be strongly related to cancer. half of them correspond to various phenotypes of cancer  based on the information retrieved from omim database, including several well-studied carcinogenesis genes . moreover, some important proto-oncogenes, such as myc and hras <dig>  were also absent. in fact, it is well known that proto-oncogenes are normal genes that could become the oncogenes because of their overexpression or mutations. the loss of the proto-oncogenes in nmr cells may also contribute to cancer resistance.

among all  <dig> nmr-missing genes in this pathway,  <dig> of them  were previously reported to display differential gene expression levels between cancer and normal tissues. thus, the absence of these genes might play important roles in suppressing cancer.

recently, a two-tier anti-cancer mechanism associated with contact inhibition regulated by p16ink4a and p27kip <dig> has been reported in nmr  <cit> . however, rat cells were found to only have contact inhibition regulated by p27kip <dig>  this is consistent with our results as rats only have p27kip <dig> gene. thus, nmr appeared to have additional unique protective mechanisms for cancer resistance.

2) mapk signalling pathway
the mapk signalling pathway is an important pathway how proteins in the cytoplasm communicate the signals from the receptors on the cell membrane to the nucleus. it is in the central of a molecular metabolic network that mediates cell differentiation and proliferation. in mammalian cells, the mapk pathway contains three major groups of proteins, including erk , p <dig> kinase and sapk . these proteins are abnormally regulated in various diseases, including cancer and inflammation.

in this study,  <dig> genes were found to be absent in nmr . by retrieving the omim database and gxa database, we found that  <dig>  of them have been reported to be related to various phenotypes of cancer in other mammals and  <dig>  of them had differential expression levels between cancer and normal tissues.

in this pathway, three proto-oncogenes, hras <dig>  myc and pdgfb , were absent in nmr. it has been previously shown that when one of these genes was mutated, the activity of their enzymes could be stuck in the "on" or "off" position, which was an essential step during the development of many cancers  <cit> . recently, it has also been reported that nmr and rat cells acted totally opposed if transfected with hras <dig>  nmr cell cycle came to an abrupt end as the presence of abnormal chromatin material and anaphase bridges and, while transfected rat cell grew rapidly and formed tumours eventually  <cit> . therefore, the loss of these genes might also play a significant role in cancer resistance.

although the phenotypes of cancer could not be found for other nmr-missing genes, some of them have been demonstrated to be related to the survival of cancer cells, such as jund and park genes. jund is an ap- <dig> family member involved in various biological processes such as cell apoptosis and tumour metastasis, and could regulate survival of tumour cells in prostate cancer  <cit> . prak is a protein kinase, which was previously shown to be implicated in the suppression of skin carcinogenesis  <cit> . further experiments are needed to investigate the relationship between these genes and tumorigenesis.

3) wnt signalling pathway
the "wnt signalling pathway" is a conserved protein-protein interaction network that regulates cell fate decisions and cell-cell communication. this pathway plays a significant role in maintaining stability of internal environment by regulating cell niche in vivo. abnormal regulation of this pathway could lead to neoplastic proliferation which is involved in the progress of cancer cells.

seventeen genes were found to be absent in the nmr genome . among them,  <dig>  genes have corresponding phenotypes of cancer whereas  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed between cancer and normal tissues. molecular-level studies have indicated that approximately 90% of the activating mutations of genes in this pathway could cause different cancers such as colorectal cancer  <cit> .

several well-studied cancer-related genes, such as myc, rhoa, lef <dig> and rac <dig>  were absent in this pathway of nmr. myc is a well-known proto-oncogene and has been frequently used to induce tumour formation in a lot of animal experiments of cancer research. rhoa has been deeply studied and proved as a cancer-regulated gene, which controlled metastasis of tumour cells, acted as a regulator of male hormone activity in prostate cancer cells  <cit> , and triggered a particular microvesicle signalling pathway in cancer cells  <cit> . lef <dig> protein could interact with a number of other proteins, such as ctbp and nlk. these interactions were thought to be responsible for the invasion and growth of prostate cancer  <cit> . rac <dig> was found to be associated with dna transcription. previous studies have reported that activation of rac <dig> mediated twist1-induced cancer cell migration  <cit> . on the other hand,  <dig> of the nmr-missing genes in this pathway, such as dkk <dig>  sox <dig> and ccnd <dig>  have not been reported to be related to any disease including cancer. it is possible that some of them are also involved in cancer formation and could be further experimentally verified.

sequence variation analysis of class i genes
based on the blastp sequence alignment results, we found that  <dig>  of the orthologs had no gaps and  <dig>  orthologs only possessed a small  gaps, suggesting that most of the orthologous proteins between rat and nmr had rare insertions/deletions during evolution. on the other hand,  <dig> orthologous proteins showed significant segment insertions/deletions whose length was more than  <dig> amino acids. further analysis of these inserted and deleted fragments in these proteins revealed that many of them contained conserved sites, including functionally active sites . for example, we observed that parts of the specific rna/dna binding site and the specific cytokine receptor motif were deleted in the nmr fusip <dig> and nrcam proteins, respectively.

other domains affected by the insertion/deletion of certain segments included atp-binding, ca2+ binding and some other metal catalytic binding sites. for example, a 30-amino-acid-long sequence fragment was found to be inserted into the putative catalytic site in nmr ship <dig> when compared with its ortholog in rat. it has been previously demonstrated that the phosphate domain of ship <dig> was essential for catalytic activity in vivo  <cit>  and the loss of ship <dig> could promote leukemogenesis in a virus-infected mouse model  <cit> . we suspect the insertion of such a long segment of ship <dig> would change the function or expression of this gene. on the other hand, wrong annotation of some nmr proteins could not be excluded. further studies are required to verify the presence of the sequence variations and their influence on the regulation or function of these proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, a comparative genomics study was carried out to investigate the genes that were either common between rat and nmr, or specific to each of them. the majority of genes were shared by the two rodents, whereas each organism had a significant part of unique genes. seven cancer-related protein families, such as melanoma-associated antigen family, protein kinase c family and hsp family were found to be significantly expanded. further analysis of the genes absent in nmr indicated that the majority of them have been shown to be linked to many forms of cancer. finally, some conserved functional domains were found to be possibly influenced by the insertion or deletion of certain fragments in nmr, which may change the expression or function of some of these genes. these results may provide important clues about the molecular mechanisms of cancer resistance of nmr and help identify new cancer-related genes  <cit>  in mammals. as future topics, it is important to study such complex mechanisms from the viewpoints of network  <cit>  and dynamics  <cit>  by further incorporating the expression data.
