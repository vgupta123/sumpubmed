BACKGROUND
dna topoisomerases are enzymes responsible for changing the dna topological state. they are necessarily involved in all dna processes  and the resulting appropriate topoisomerase activity modifies the dna linking number locally and thereby eliminate excess of negative and positive supercoils generated upstream and downstream from the corresponding machinery  <cit> . topoisomerases are classified as type i or type ii according to whether the transient break in the dna during their activity is a single-strand  or double-strand   <cit> . they are further classified as type ia or ib and type iia or iib according to the presence of particular motifs in the amino-acid sequence  <cit> .

reverse gyrase is a particular type ia topoisomerase and it is the only known dna topoisomerase to introduce positive supercoils into dna  <cit> . reverse gyrase was initially discovered in hyperthermophilic and thermophilic archaea and bacteria <cit> . it was further reported that reverse gyrase was the marker of hyperthermophily and that the corresponding gene may be essential for life at high temperature  <cit> . the positive supercoiling activity of reverse gyrase was proposed to stabilize the dna duplex against denaturation in extreme temperature environments  <cit> , and thereby avoid dna melting. positive supercoiling of dna prevents formation of open complexes  <cit>  as demonstrated by in vitro assays of sulfolobus dna transcription  <cit> . homeostatic control of dna supercoiling involving reverse gyrase has been suggested in hyperthermophilic archaea  <cit> , as it was previously reported for mesophilic bacteria  <cit> . reverse gyrase acts in vitro as a heat-protective dna chaperone, independently of its supercoiling activity  <cit> . the helicase-topoisomerase ia chimeric structure of the reverse gyrase  <cit>  is reminiscent of the physical and functional interaction between the recq-like protein and topoisomerase iii. this protein pair is found in bacteria and eukarya, and is involved in the dna repair and recombination needed for genome stability  <cit> . it has therefore been suggested that the reverse gyrase in hyperthermophilic archaea has a role in the maintenance of genome stability  <cit> . reverse gyrase efficiently anneals complementary single-stranded circles and introduces positive supercoils into dna containing a bubble and may thus act as a renaturase, contributing to the genome stability by eliminating impaired regions  <cit> . there is indeed diverse evidence that reverse gyrase is involved in recombination and repair. it is specifically recruited to dna after uv irradiation  <cit> . the positive supercoiling reaction of reverse gyrase in vitro is stimulated by the single-strand dna binding protein   <cit> , a protein that binds to single-strand dna to prevent its premature annealing during various dna metabolism processes including replication, recombination and repair  <cit> ; a functional interaction between these two proteins has been demonstrated in vivo in the presence of dna  <cit> . ssb also enhances the binding and cleavage of uv-irradiated substrates by reverse gyrase, further implicating reverse gyrase in dna repair  <cit> . reverse gyrase inhibits the activity of the translesion dna polymerase poly/dpo <dig> in vitro, possibly thereby preventing the potential high mutational effect of poly/dpo <dig>  <cit> . finally, reverse gyrase shows unwinding activity of substrates containing helical junctions, consistent with its involvement in recombination and repair  <cit> .

a gene encoding a reverse gyrase has been also discovered in some moderately thermophilic bacteria: for example in nautilia profundicola, which grows optimally at 45°c  <cit> , the expression of this gene increases substantially at higher temperature. this may confer a selective advantage for such organisms which live close to hydrothermal vents and are therefore subject to frequent and rapid temperature fluctuations  <cit> . possibly, reverse gyrase may be important for thermoadaptation rather than the hyperthermophilic lifestyle as such. the situation seems to differ between hyperthermophilic organisms with one and those with two reverse gyrase genes. thermococcus kodakaraensis is a hyperthermophilic organism belonging to the euryarchaeota phylum; it has a single reverse gyrase gene that was shown to be not essential for hyperthermophilic life, except at temperatures above 90°c  <cit> . by contrast, in the crenarchaeon sulfolobus islandicus, both topr <dig> and topr <dig> genes were recently demonstrated to be essential  <cit> . thus, the two reverse gyrase genes in sulfolobales, and possibly in all crenarchaeota containing two, seem to be linked either to the hyperthermophilic lifestyle and/or to other essential functions.

reverse gyrases clearly have several functions in the cell, probably involving interactions with different partners according to the cellular process. the redundancy of reverse gyrase genes in most members of the crenarchaeota phylum strongly suggests specialization of the two reverse gyrases with topr <dig> and topr <dig> having different functions. the topr <dig> and topr <dig> genes in s. solfataricus p <dig> are differently regulated, with different expression patterns according to the growth phase and temperature, and topr <dig> is probably involved in the control of the topological state of dna  <cit> . experiments in vitro with the two purified recombinant reverse gyrases from s. solfataricus showed that they exhibit different enzymatic characteristics and in particular different behaviors with respect to temperature  <cit> .

as both genes are essential in sulfolobales, we looked for culture conditions revealing differential regulation of the two enzymes to study further their respective roles. we determined the lowest temperature at which only one of the two reverse gyrases exhibits significant enzymatic activity in vitro. then, we tested whether s. solfataricus p <dig> cells at this temperature contain one or both reverse gyrases, to assess whether one or both reverse gyrases are tightly linked to the hyperthermophilic lifestyle. we report that topr <dig> is not active at 45°c whereas topr <dig> exhibits significant positive supercoiling activity at this temperature. we also report for the first time the number of reverse gyrase molecules per cell: s. solfataricus contains approximately  <dig> molecules of topr <dig> and  <dig> molecules of topr <dig> per cell when cells are actively dividing at 80°c. after three weeks at 45°c, there was no cell division nor replication initiation; the abundance of topr <dig> was very much lower than at 80°c whereas that of topr <dig> is largely unaffected. the cultures were returned to 80°c, and growth ability and replication activity are fully restored and the amounts of topr <dig> characteristic of actively dividing cells were recovered. these quantitative findings contribute to elucidating the different roles of reverse gyrase.

RESULTS
topr <dig>  but not topr <dig>  remains active at 45°c
the two reverse gyrases of s. solfataricus exhibit different enzymatic properties  <cit> . although both enzymes are able to introduce positive supercoils into dna, topr <dig> introduces a higher density of positive supercoils and at a higher rate than does topr <dig>  this difference is mainly due to the very high processivity of topr <dig>  whereas topr <dig> is distributive. the activity of topr <dig> is strictly dependent on the temperature: from relaxation at 60°c the linking number increases progressively with increasing temperature with maximum positive supercoiling being reached at 90°c. by contrast, topr <dig> is not active at high temperature in vitro , but exhibits a significant positive supercoiling activity at 60°c  <cit> . thus, the two reverse gyrases can be distinguished according to their activities at different temperatures. several studies report that various protein machineries in hyperthermophilic organisms of the sulfolobus genus are functional at low temperature: the proton pump  <cit> , the transcription machinery  <cit> , replication and repair dna polymerases  <cit>  and dna topoisomerase  <cit> . consequently, we investigated whether both reverse gyrases of s. solfataricus are active at temperatures below 60°c, the lowest temperature previously tested  <cit> : we performed topoisomerase assays at temperatures from 45°c to 80°c . enzymes are generally less active at low temperature, so we used a topoisomerase:dna molecular ratio of  <dig> to allow weak activities to be detected. the main characteristics of the two enzymes were observed at control temperatures : distributivity for topr <dig> and processivity for topr <dig>  <cit> . a significant positive supercoiling activity of topr <dig> was observed only at temperatures above 70°c . topr <dig> displayed a weak relaxation activity at 55°c and 50°c but was not active at 45°c . by contrast, topr <dig> was active at 45°c as revealed by the topoisomer profile obtained in one-dimensional gel electrophoresis . the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis experiments revealed that topr <dig> was able to introduce large numbers of positive supercoils into dna at 45°c . although the positive supercoil density at 45°c seemed to be similar to that obtained at 70°c, the population of highly positively supercoiled plasmids was smaller at 45°c . there was also a wider range of intermediate topoisomers from more or less highly positively supercoiled to negatively supercoiled at lower  than higher temperatures . these observations suggest that topr <dig> is less processive at lower temperature. two dna polymerases from s. solfataricus, polb1/dpo <dig> and poly/dpo <dig> involved in dna replication and repair, respectively, show also temperature-dependent processivity  <cit> . in addition, between 45°c and 60°c, we observed that topr <dig> produces more nicked dna than at higher temperatures  . this clearly indicates that low temperature does not inhibit binding or dna cleavage but does affect the dna strand passage or religation. interestingly, overproduction of nicked dna is not observed for topr <dig> , further evidence of the difference between these two enzymes. in conclusion, in our conditions, topr <dig> preserves a significant highly positive supercoiling activity at temperatures down to 45°c whereas topr <dig> is not active at such low temperatures. we then tested whether s. solfataricus is still alive at this low temperature and studied the reverse gyrase content in vivo.

s. solfataricus cells preserve their membrane integrity at 45°c, but cells do not divide
we first evaluated cell density, cell size, membrane integrity, and cell distribution according to dna content in cultures at 45°c. we transferred cultures of exponentially growing cells at 80°c to 45°c and maintained the cultures at 45°c for three weeks. cell density was determined both by measuring optical density at 600 nm  and by flow cytometry, and we confirmed that the od600nm accurately reflects the number of cells as counted by flow cytometry. despite a small increase of od600nm during the first two days, the cell density remained roughly constant during the three weeks at 45°c . the same result was obtained when we changed the culture medium every week , showing that this was not due to any modification of the growth medium composition over the long period at 45°c. thus, the constant od600nm over a period of three weeks at 45°c was due to the temperature.

control cells cultured at 80°c and cells transferred to 45°c were examined by phase contrast microscopy: that both presented the same round shape . average cell sizes were calculated from measurements of at least  <dig> cells in each condition. in both conditions, the cells were similarly small:  <dig>  μm ±  <dig>  for control cells at 80°c and  <dig>  μm ±  <dig>  for cells transferred to 45°c, independent of the time at which the cells are collected . this is consistent with a previous report that sulfolobus cell size is not affected by transfer to room temperature or even ice-water  <cit> .

when cells are exposed to an environmental condition different from their optimal growth conditions, cell membrane integrity may be affected. we used the live/dead® baclight™ bacterial viability kit  <cit> , which has been validated for archaea  <cit>  to test membrane integrity. as expected, the exponentially growing cultures at 80°c contained few damaged cells ; after transfer from 80°c to 45°c and incubation for 21 days, the numbers of cells with preserved membrane integrity were similar to control values . this indicates that the cells do not lyse at this low temperature, and are resistant to it for a long period.

we used flow cytometry to investigate cell size and cell composition  and cell distribution according to dna content. cells transferred to 45°c became slightly more heterogeneous, exhibiting a wider range of fsc than control cells . there was a symmetric decrease of the fsc range for cells transferred back to 80°c after three weeks at 45°c . as microscopy indicated that there was no significant change in the cell size at any time during the experiment, regardless the direction of temperature shift , the symmetric and reproducible variation of the fsc parameter presumably reflects a change in cell composition. indeed, the protein concentration declined when cells were transferred to 45°c to half that in 80°c control cells. this probably reflects a change in the balance between degradation, stability and basal synthesis for a particular set of proteins. changes in the lipid membrane composition is also a plausible explanation because the number of cyclopentane rings in the tetraether lipids of sulfolobale membranes varies with temperature  <cit> . the composition and/or the properties of the flexible cell wall may also be modified by the temperature change and affect the fsc.

the 80°c control cells could be separated into three sub-populations according to the dna content  as previously described  <cit> : a minor population containing one genome equivalent; a significant population with a dna content between one and two genome equivalents; and the largest cell population containing two genome equivalents. the proportions of the different populations in s. solfataricus cultures growing exponentially at 80°c were consistent with the relative lengths of cell cycle phases as previously reported for actively dividing sulfolobus cells  <cit> . this distribution was drastically modified after a prolonged incubation at 45°c: the cytograms after  <dig>   <dig> and 21 days at 45°c evidence the disappearance of cells with a dna content between one and two genome equivalents; cells containing one genome continue to constitute a small part of the cell population; and the proportion of cells with two genome equivalents increases even further . the absence of cells with intermediate amounts of dna reflects the absence of active replication. as the cell density remains constant, it is reasonable to correlate the absence of replication with the absence of cell division at 45°c. the disappearance of cells with intermediate amounts of dna cannot be explained by degradation of partially replicated dna because this process would imply either a large increase of the cell population harboring one genome or the lysis of these cells. these two possibilities are clearly not in accordance with our results. thus, we conclude that the cells having initiated replication, finish their replication, leading cells with two genome equivalents. this completion of replication may be slow, that is consistent with the reduced processivity of the dna replicases polb1/dpo <dig> and poly/dpo <dig>  shown in vitro with decreasing temperatures  <cit> . further evidence for this is that the cell distribution 48 hours after transfer to 45°c is similar to that of control cells except that the population of cells with an intermediate dna content is slightly but significantly shifted towards a dna content between  <dig>  and  <dig> equivalent genomes and away from  <dig> to  <dig>  genomes . moreover, the cell density increases slightly during these first two days, consistent with residual cell division. we cannot exclude the possibility that there may have been initiation of replication during the first few days after transfer. it has been shown that during the cell cycle of sulfolobus cultivated at 80°c, a new round of replication can occur only when cell division has been completed  <cit> . however, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the absence of cell division was as consequence of there having been no replication activity upon prolonged incubation at 45°c. in any case, the absence of cells with an intermediate dna content after seven days at 45°c clearly indicates that no new replication started during prolonged incubation at 45°c.

when cells maintained at 45°c for 21 days were transferred back to 80°c, there was a transient small decrease of the od600nm within a couple of hours . the od600nm increased progressively thereafter and the growth curve of the cultures transferred from 45°c to 80°c was similar to that for control cultures at 80°c . cell size did not change following the return to 80°c   and the proportion of damaged cells remained very low, and similar to control values . in flow cytometry, the cytogram of cells transferred back to 80°c and collected 24 hours after the up-shift was similar to that of the 80°c control cells . indeed, the presence of cells with an intermediate dna content is fully restored, indicating that normal replication activity was recovered. hence, the sulfolobus cells maintained at 45°c retained their ability to grow again actively at 80°c even after three weeks at the low temperature. a similar phenomenon has been reported for sulfolobus cells kept for a short time at room temperature and transferred back to their optimal growth temperature  <cit> .

in conclusion, s. solfataricus cells are resistant to long periods at 45°c and are able to recover a normal cell activity, i.e. cell division and replication, when they are transferred back to 80°c.

quantification of topr <dig> and topr <dig> per s. solfataricus cell
we tested whether the resistance of s. solfataricus to relatively low temperatures was associated with changes to the reverse gyrase content. to distinguish between topr <dig> and topr <dig> in crude extracts, we obtained two specific antibodies , each raised against two peptides only found in one of the two reverse gyrases and absent from all other putative proteins of s. solfataricus. the pre-immune sera recognized some proteins in s. solfataricus extracts, but did so only very weakly, and none were similar in molecular mass to the reverse gyrases . the specificity of both antibodies was checked with recombinant topr <dig> and topr <dig>  previously purified in our lab  <cit> . thus, the anti-topr <dig> antibodies recognized purified recombinant topr <dig> of s. solfataricus  but not the purified recombinant topr <dig> ; likewise, the anti-topr <dig> antibodies recognized the purified recombinant topr <dig> of s. solfataricus  but not the purified recombinant topr <dig> .

in crude extracts of s. solfataricus, the anti-topr <dig> antibodies gave a strong signal for a single band migrating in agreement with the theoretical molecular mass of topr <dig>  . the strongest signal given by the anti-topr <dig> antibodies was with a band migrating in agreement with the theoretical molecular mass of topr <dig> ; it also revealed several additional bands with lower molecular masses, probably corresponding to proteolysis products . the electrophoretic mobility of the protein detected in the s. solfataricus crude extract was slightly slower, indicating a higher apparent molecular mass, than that of recombinant topr <dig> . this difference was also observed with antibodies raised against the same specific oligopeptides but produced in another rabbit . we conclude that the protein in crude extracts recognized by the antibodies raised against the topr <dig> peptides is indeed topr <dig> which, like reverse gyrase  <cit>  and numerous sulfolobales proteins  <cit> , has post-translational modifications which remain to be elucidated. we used the topr1- and topr2-specific sera to determine the numbers of the two reverse gyrase molecules present in the different crude s. solfataricus cell extracts. we established a calibration curve with known amounts of purified recombinant proteins to allow determination of the absolute number of molecules of each reverse gyrase per cell . the signal intensity in the various crude extracts was in the same range as that of the calibration, we were able to determine the precise number of topr <dig> and topr <dig> molecules per s. solfataricus cell .

number of topr <dig> and topr <dig> per s. solfataricus cell at 80°c
this is the first study reporting the specific detection of two reverse gyrases within the same organism. the immunodetection signal obtained for cells growing exponentially at 80°c  corresponded to 54 ±  <dig> molecules of topr <dig> and 127 ±  <dig> molecules of topr <dig> per cell . these are very low values, but nevertheless in agreement with the very small amounts of the corresponding transcripts reported previously  <cit> .

it has been shown that reverse gyrase has a heat-protective dna chaperone activity in vitro. this activity requires a high protein/dna mass ratio, of at least  <dig>  <cit> . the results we report here indicate a total of approximately  <dig> molecules of reverse gyrase per cell; if reverse gyrases are regularly distributed along the chromosome, this corresponds to a protein/dna mass ratio approximately 38-fold lower than required for the in vitro chaperone activity. these observations can be reconciled by putative recruitment of reverse gyrase to, for example, sites of damaged dna as previously discussed  <cit> . similarly, our evidence that there is little reverse gyrase  in each cell is discordant with the requirement for a saturating concentration of the protein for the unwinding activity of topr <dig> of four-way dna junctions  <cit> .

by contrast, our estimations of the amounts of reverse gyrase in vivo are consistent with the renaturase activity evidenced in in vitro <cit> . indeed the introduction of positive supercoils into dna containing a bubble of denaturation or the annealing of complementary single strand dna circles have been evidenced in vitro with low protein/dna mass ratios   <cit> . these activities are in agreement with thermoprotection of dna by reverse gyrase: its positive supercoiling activity limits the formation of single-strand regions at high temperature  <cit> . all in vitro experiments have been performed with dna substrate devoid of any other bound protein; however, in vivo, dna is obviously stabilized by the binding of chromatin proteins, such as sul7d. the activities of reverse gyrase evidenced in vitro may be modulated by dna binding proteins. indeed, sul7d inhibits reverse gyrase activity  <cit> , and the single-strand binding protein, ssb, stimulates both dna binding and the positive supercoiling of reverse gyrase  <cit> .

loss of topr <dig> from s. solfataricus cells maintained at 45°c
when cells were transferred from 80°c to 45°c for three weeks, the amount of topr <dig> per cell remained approximately constant throughout the period at 45°c  suggesting either particularly high stability and/or a basal synthesis. the concentration of topr <dig> decreased : the number of topr <dig> per cell declined by two thirds after 7 days, four fifths after 14 days, and to close to the detection threshold after 21 days at 45°c . there was no cell division at 45°c such that the cell number remained unchanged over the three weeks at 45°c, so the loss of topr <dig> was necessarily due to a specific but slow degradation. the protein concentration in the crude extracts from cells transferred to 45°c was systematically half that in extracts from 80°c control cells. consequently, the number of topr <dig> molecules per unit protein declined even more than the number per cell, whereas the number of topr <dig> molecules per unit protein doubled. thus, the amounts of the two reverse gyrases were regulated differently in this long-term down-shift experiment.cells maintained at 45°c for 21 days were able to resume active cell division when shifted back to 80°c. we assayed the two reverse gyrases 24 hours after the shift back to 80°c. the concentration of topr <dig>  returned to baseline control values and that of topr <dig> remained unchanged . thus, the ability of the cells to divide correlated with there being appropriate amounts of both topr <dig> and topr <dig> 

the amounts of topr <dig> and topr <dig> did not change detectably within the first 6 hours following the transfer from 80°c to 45°c . the loss of topr <dig> observed was slow, and may therefore have been related to the reduced cell activity rather than directly to the temperature change itself. we found that topr <dig> is not active at low temperature in vitro, consistent with its loss from cultures at low temperature. when the cell activity is reduced, dna transaction processes are less active, and therefore rigorous control of the topological state of dna is less critical. at 45°c there was no cell division and no replication, and therefore few or no topological modification of the dna, so presumably topr <dig> is not needed. this implies that topr <dig> is the topoisomerase mostly responsible for the dna topological state in s. solfataricus. however, it is also possible that, at low temperature, topr <dig> complements the topr <dig> deficiency. topr <dig> exhibits dna positive supercoiling activity, which may be sufficient for the residual dna topological regulation at low temperature. in cells growing at high temperature, topr <dig> is presumably required to resolve the frequent modifications of dna topological state triggered by the cell division activity and enhanced by the high temperature itself.

topr <dig> is present both at high temperature  and low temperature  and it is active at 45°c in vitro . the resumption of normal cell activity following the shift back to 80°c after three weeks at 45°c reveals that genome stability was preserved. although there is little rigorous evidence, reverse gyrase has long been proposed to be involved in maintenance of genome stability  <cit> . as only topr <dig> is the only reverse gyrase maintained in cells at 45°c, it may have this function either by stabilizing particular regions of the dna or by participating in dna metabolism pathways. after a long period at 45°c, cultures contain few or no cells with between  <dig> and  <dig> genome equivalent, although such cells with 1- <dig> genome equivalent are observed during the 48 h following the transfer to 45°c. topr <dig> may contribute to the residual replication activity in cells with 1- <dig> genome equivalent, such that they progress to containing a whole number  of genomes. transcriptional analysis has shown that the abundance of the topr <dig> transcript increases during the g1/s transition phase, suggesting an implication of topr <dig> in replication  <cit> . at 45°c, topr <dig> may have short-term functions in both genome stability and replication; subsequently, only the function contributing to genome stability appears to be relevant in the long term as there is no new replication.

topr <dig> from s. solfataricus inhibits the in vitro activity of the translesion dna poly/dpo <dig>  a dna polymerase involved in response to dna damage  <cit> . topr <dig> and poly/dpo <dig> interact both in vivo and in vitro, and presumably this physical interaction mediates the inhibition. however, the interaction was demonstrated with anti-topr <dig> antibodies that recognize both topr <dig> and topr <dig>  so it is not clear whether one or both reverse gyrases co-immunoprecipitated with poly/dpo <dig>  the topoisomerase domain of topr <dig> was reported to be responsible for its affinity for poly/dpo <dig>  the topoisomerase domains of sulfolobus topr <dig> and topr <dig> exhibit a high identity  <cit> , so it is plausible that topr <dig> may exhibit significant affinity for poly/dpo <dig>  if this were true, it would imply that topr <dig>  the only reverse gyrase present and active at 45°c, inhibits poly/dpo <dig>  at 80°c, there would be competition between the two reverse gyrases, the results of which would depend on their abundance and their respective affinities for poly/dpo <dig> 

sulfolobus cells at 45°c have no topr <dig> although it is required at 80°c. presumably, topr <dig> is inessential at low temperatures and indispensable at high temperature because the mechanical response of dna is temperature dependent. n. profundicola grows optimally at 45°c and has only one reverse gyrase gene; following exposure to 65°c for two hours, the abundance of the reverse gyrase transcript increases substantially, suggesting that more reverse gyrase is required  <cit> . this is consistent with the increased frequency of dna melting at high temperature leading to a greater requirement for reverse gyrase. possibly, the sulfolobus topr <dig> is the functional homologue of the reverse gyrase of nautilia, both proteins exhibiting quantitative variations with temperature. t. kodakaraensis also has a single reverse gyrase: a t. kodakaraensis mutant deleted for the corresponding gene is viable at temperatures of 60-90°c but not at temperatures higher than 90°c  <cit> . possibly, there are compensatory mutations, or other topoisomerases, present in t. kodakaraensis, compensating for the absence of reverse gyrase but only at temperatures lower than 90°c. in s. islandicus, a strain very closely related to s. solfataricus, no mutant viable at 75°c could be obtained for either topr <dig> or topr <dig> encoding genes, suggesting that both enzymes are essential  <cit> . in this work, we found that in s. solfataricus topr <dig> is the major reverse gyrase for the control of the topological state dna. however, the absence of topr <dig> can be compensated at least partially by topr <dig>  its activity being sufficient to control the minor low topological changes at low temperature. at 75°c, topr <dig> cannot complement for the absence of topr <dig> because dna melting is much more extensive, and problematic, at this temperature. as topr <dig> may have functions not displayed by topr <dig>  topr <dig> mutants may be lethal. these various observations are concordant in implying that topr <dig> is required at high temperature and/or for thermoadaptation.

in this report, we demonstrate that s. solfataricus is able to survive at a low temperature  for a long period, without dividing but with most cells in the culture containing two fully replicated genomes. they are ready to resume a normal cell activity with active cell division as soon as favorable conditions are restored. this property of “cold” resistance may facilitate the spread of s. solfataricus to new niches. we also show that the two reverse gyrases are not regulated in the same way indicating that they do have different and possibly overlapping functions in the cells. we provide here evidence, in addition to our previous results  <cit> , that topr <dig> is important for the regulation of the supercoiling density of the genome, which is affected by replication, transcription and recombination, particularly active in dividing cells at high temperature.

CONCLUSIONS
we report the first quantification of the numbers of reverse gyrase molecules per cell in s. solfataricus: in actively growing cultures at 80°c, there are approximately  <dig> molecules of topr <dig> and  <dig> molecules of topr <dig> per cell. at 45°c, s. solfataricus does not grow and the reverse gyrase content changes: the amount of topr <dig> decreases substantially, although that of topr <dig> remains unchanged. these findings in vivo are in agreement with the activities of the two enzymes in vitro. topr <dig> exhibits significant positive supercoiling activity at 45°c, a temperature at which topr <dig> is not active. topr <dig> is inessential at low temperature but required at high temperature and therefore probably involved in thermoadaptation and/or in dna transaction processes during active division of s. solfataricus cells at 80°c. by contrast, topr <dig> is at a constant concentration at both 80°c and 45°c suggesting that topr <dig> may be involved in the maintenance of genome stability, particularly in the long term at 45°c when there is no cell division and no replication.
