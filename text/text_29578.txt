BACKGROUND
neuropsychiatric disorders are complex diseases that are strongly influenced by genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors  <cit> . one of the central challenges in current psychiatric research is to determine the contributions of these factors to major neuropsychiatric disorders and use this knowledge to develop effective strategies for disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention.

beginning with the elucidation of a consensus dna sequence of the human genome and extending through current efforts to exhaustively document genetic variability in human populations, much has been learned about the genes and genetic variants that contribute to major neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia  <cit> , alzheimer's disease  <cit>  and drug addiction  <cit> . unlike mendelian disorders, however, which can often be traced to mutations that disrupt gene structure or coding sequences, genetic markers that associate with complex disorders often map to chromosomal sites located outside of gene coding regions  <cit> . such observations suggest that genetic variants that regulate gene expression, rather than disrupt gene structure, may be a major source of liability for, or protection from, complex disorders  <cit> .

because of their potential importance for explaining the etiology and phenotypic diversity of complex diseases, there is currently great interest in developing methods for identifying regulatory genetic variants  <cit> . unlike coding region mutations or chromosomal rearrangements, which can be identified by dna sequencing alone, detection of regulatory variants requires experimentation, such as measurements of variation in mrna expression or splicing. to meet this challenge, hybridization-based microarray assays have been developed that are capable of measuring variation in the expression of hundreds-to-thousands of genes in multiple samples in a single experiment  <cit> .

while microarrays have provided important information concerning variation in mrna expression in a variety of tissues and cell lines and have the potential to identify both cis- and trans-acting regulatory variants  <cit> , they are not necessarily the best choice for analyzing mrna expression in human brain. when used to compare mrna expression among independent samples, microarray-based assays typically require large numbers of samples to obtain statistically significant correlations between genetic variants and mrna expression and, in the absence of a cdna pcr amplification step, often lack the sensitivity to detect rare mrnas  <cit> . the requirement for large numbers of samples to attain statistical significance is closely related to the large variation in mrna expression among samples that is determined by non-genetic factors. this is particularly a problem for studies of mrna expression in human brain, since the quality of mrna isolated from autopsy brain tissue often varies among samples and the individuals that provided the samples differ in ages, sex, medical history, drug use and cause of death. thus, variation in mrna expression caused by regulatory genetic variants is often obscured, especially in small collections of unmatched samples.

in contrast to assays that involve comparisons between independent samples, assays that measure allele-specific differences in mrna expression have the advantage that the relative level of mrna expression from each genetic allele is determined within individual samples, with each autosomal allele serving as a control for the other  <cit> . combined with pcr-based-amplification of cdna reverse-transcribed from mrna, this approach has produced highly accurate measurements of differential mrna expression in a variety of human tissues, including brain, and provided important information about cis-acting genetic variants that regulate mrna expression  <cit> . to date, however, only assays of low-throughput design have been used for allele-specific measurements of mrna expression in human brain.

in this paper we describe a medium-throughput method for assaying allele-specific mrna expression based on pcr amplification and next-generation dna sequencing technology. our results show that this assay produces allelic expression imbalance  ratios  for mrnas expressed in human brain of outstanding quality and reproducibility.

after measuring aei ratios for many candidate genes, we noticed that graphs of log2aei ratios ordered from most-negative to most-positive produced distribution patterns that are characteristic for each gene/marker snp pair. mathematical modeling of these log2aei distributions revealed that they can be a rich source of information concerning the genetic variants that regulate mrna expression for each gene. we believe that, used together, our aei assay and mathematical modeling provide powerful tools for identifying regulatory genetic variants that contribute to major neuropsychiatric disorders.

RESULTS
next generation dna sequencing-based aei assay
an outline of our aei assay is shown in figure  <dig>  experimental details are provided in methods, table  <dig>  additional file  <dig>  figures s <dig> - s <dig>  and additional file  <dig>  tables s <dig> - s <dig>  briefly, genomic dna  isolated from small  samples of frozen human brain was used for both genotyping and as a control for cdna-based aei measurements. to facilitate our long-term goal of screening several-hundred neuropsychiatric disorder candidate genes, we carried out genomewide genotyping for each of the  <dig> brains in our collection using illumina humanomni1-quad microarrays. for most genes, this information allowed us to infer the genotype of suitable mrna marker snps  for most of our candidate genes. snapshot® multiplex kits  were used to genotype msnps not included or tagged by snps on the illumina arrays.

for each candidate gene, gene-specific pcr primers were used to amplify segments of gdna or cdna that contain the corresponding msnp. to reduce the total number of pcr reactions, only gdna and cdna from brain samples heterozygous for the msnps were used as templates. to simplify the generation and analysis of the pcr reaction products, pcr amplifications of individual genes were carried out in sets, with each sample-primer combination in an individual tube. in all,  <dig> sets  comprising  <dig> to  <dig> gdna template-based and  <dig> to  <dig> cdna template-based reaction mixes were independently amplified .

to ascertain the efficiency of the pcr amplifications, aliquots from each reaction mix were resolved by electrophoresis in 15% polyacrylamide gels, and the intensity and purity of the pcr products examined by ethidium bromide staining. approximately 93% of the samples yielded robustly stained, single pcr products. in cases where staining of pcr products with the predicted molecular weight was weak, additional pcr reactions  were carried out to increase the amount of pcr products carried to the next step and to ensure that a sufficient number of mrna molecules were sampled to obtain meaningful aei ratios .

following confirmation of amplification, approximately equal amounts of pcr products  derived from a single brain sample were pooled, purified using qiaexii beads and ligated to an indexed illumina adapter coding for that sample . the ligated pcr products from all of the brain samples were pooled  and resolved by electrophoresis in 3% agarose gels. ligation products in the appropriate size range  were excised from the gels and used as templates for pcr amplification with illumina primers  <dig>  and  <dig>  . the resulting pcr products were sequenced using an illumina genome analyzer  <dig> . the above procedure  was independently carried out twice  for a subset of genes and brain samples, beginning from the isolation of gdna and total rna.

following sequencing, reads were sorted, collated and tabulated for calculation of aei ratios using a custom computer program, as described in methods and additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  as shown in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  approximately 85% of the sequencing reads were full-length . overall, approximately 60% of the reads survived quality-control triage and were used for the calculation of aei ratios . in total, we obtained approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> useable, independent reads for gdna-derived sequences  and  <dig> ×  <dig> reads for cdna-derived sequences  in assay- <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig> reads for gdna-derived sequences  and  <dig>  ×  <dig> reads for cdna-derived sequences  in illumina assay- <dig>  for the second assay, the number of reads/sample for individual genes  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for gdna-derived sequences  and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for cdna-derived sequences  .

an important application of gdna-based aei measurements is the quantification of allele-specific bias that occurs during the pcr-amplification of gdna and cdna segments containing the marker snp. as shown in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  significant allele-specific amplification bias for gdna templates was observed for most genes, with occasional genes showing greater than  <dig> -fold differences in amplification between alleles. this type of bias has been previously observed in pcr-based aei assays  <cit> .

one documented source of allele-specific pcr amplification bias is the use of pcr primers that bind to sites containing a snp  <cit> . as listed in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  nine of our gene-specific pcr primers bind dna sequences containing nominal snps listed in the ncbi snp database. three of these snps, however, have  <dig> or very low heterozygosity in the han chinese population and therefore should not present a problem. one snp has a heterozygosity of  <dig> , but did not produce a significantly distorted log2aei ratio. among the remaining five genes, all with snps of unknown heterozygosity in the chinese population, two showed significant deviation of log2aei values from  <dig> 

in addition to pcr amplification bias, the presence of pseudogenes, highly homologous genes or chromosomal duplications  can also distort genomic dna aei ratios. as described in methods and additional file  <dig>  we belatedly found evidence for off-target sites in the human genome for the cyp2d <dig> and ntan <dig> pcr primer sets. we found no evidence, however, for off-target sites for any of the other pcr primer set used in our study. following previous examples  <cit> , we therefore corrected both gdna and cdna ratios by multiplying the aei ratios by the inverse of the average gdna-based aei for each gene. a list of the correction factors used to normalize aei ratios for each gene is provided in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> 

in addition to providing a method for correcting aei measurements for pcr amplification bias, gdna-based aei measurements also yield important information concerning experimental error. because only heterozygous individuals were included in our final data sets, deviations of normalized gdna aei ratios from  <dig>  can be used to estimate this error. two different approaches were used to estimate experimental error. in the first, we determined the distribution of normalized gdna aei ratios for the entire set of measurements and calculated the mean, standard deviation  and standard error of the mean  . this analysis showed that 95% of the normalized gdna aei ratios lay within the interval  <dig>  to  <dig>  . as described in additional file  <dig>  this estimate of experimental error was used to evaluate the presence or absence of aei for each gene in each sample.

in the second method, also described in additional file  <dig>  experimental error was estimated based upon a comparison of deviations of log2aei values from zero for normalized gdna aei ratios as a function of the number of sequencing reads used to calculate each ratio. as shown in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  deviations from log2aei =  <dig>  are greater than those predicted from a theoretical binomial sampling error curve, but still relatively small and decrease with increasing numbers of sequencing reads. the legend of additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig> describes an empirical method for estimating the correlation between the number of sampling reads and experimental error that does not require assumptions about the statistical distribution of the error. as listed in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  we estimate the log <dig> experimental error to be about ±  <dig>   for aei measurements generated by  <dig>  reads, ±  <dig>   for aei measurements generated by  <dig>  reads and ±  <dig>   for aei measurements generated by >  <dig>  reads. as described below, this method for evaluating experimental error was used in the mathematical modeling of log2aei population distributions.

log2aei ratio distributions for  <dig> candidate neuropsychiatric disorder genes
as seen in figure  <dig> there is considerable variability in mrna expression among the  <dig> candidate disorder genes, with measured cdna log2aei ratios ranging from - <dig>   to + <dig>  , corresponding to - <dig>  and + <dig> -fold differences in expression between alleles, respectively. figure  <dig> provides a summary of the results from illumina assay- <dig>  surprisingly, 89% of our candidate genes show significant log2aei ratios for at least one brain sample in our collection. among samples heterozygous for the msnps for a particular gene, the proportion of samples with significant log2aei ratios ranged from 5% to 100%, with an average of 36% and median 29%.

modeling log2aei distributions
as described above, log2aei distributions are characteristic for specific gene/msnp pairs and highly reproducible. to better understand these patterns, we developed a simple mathematical model that can mimic distributions of log2aei ratios with surprising accuracy. modeling the three candidate neuropsychiatric disorder genes gab <dig>  gnb1l and disc <dig> is briefly described in additional file  <dig>  a comprehensive description of this model will be presented in a separate paper .

according to our model, the shapes of log2aei distributions are influenced by: i) the number of cis- and trans-acting regulatory variants  , ii) their major allele frequencies  iii) the contribution of each variant to log2aei ratios , iv) the degree of linkage disequilibrium between rvar's , v) the degree of linkage disequilibrium between each rvar and the msnp  and vi) complex genetic, epigenetic or non-genetic factors.

a comparison of the predicted and experimentally determined log2aei distributions for gab <dig>  gnb1l and disc <dig> is shown in figure  <dig>  in the case of gab <dig>  the observation that the log2aei ratios are all in the same  direction suggests that mrna expression is primarily regulated by single cis-acting regulatory variant that is in complete linkage disequilibrium with the msnp. by contrast, the skewed log2aei distribution obtained for gnb1l, in combination with a gradient in log2aei values and the presence of several samples with negative or non-significant log2aei ratios, suggests that mrna expression is regulated by two genetic variants, a cis-acting variant partially linked to the msnp and the other unlinked or weakly linked to the msnp. finally, for disc <dig>  the nearly equally balanced, biphasic aei population distribution, suggests the influence of multiple regulatory variants, which are all unlinked  to the msnp. details of the modeling of these genes are presented in additional file  <dig> and a discussion of the results with respect to previously published studies is presented in additional file  <dig> 

discussion
in this paper we describe a pcr/next-generation dna sequencing-based method for quantifying allele-specific differences in mrna expression and demonstrate that it produces detailed and highly reproducible information concerning the expression of candidate neuropsychiatric candidate genes in human brain. the two major strengths of our assay are the ability to: 1) reproducibly measure small differences in allelic expression for both common and rare mrnas and 2) generate population distributions of log2aei ratios that are useful for generating testable hypotheses concerning the number, location and relative contributions of genetic variants that regulate mrna expression.

when analyzing large numbers  of genes and samples , the cost of our assay is approximately one-half and hands-on time approximately one-third that of low-throughput pcr/primer extension -based assays. the use of dna-sequencing instead of snapshot©-based primer-extension as the assay read-out obviates the gene-by-gene fine-tuning often required for snapshot assays, as well as the influences of differential efficiencies of incorporation of fluorescently labeled dideoxynuclotides into dna and differences in the quantum efficiency of the fluorophores, which can distort aei ratios. experimental error in snapshot©-based assays varies among genes and generally only allows quantification of aei ratios greater than  <dig> . by contrast, given sufficient numbers of sequencing reads, aei ratios as low as  <dig>  can often be reliably measured using our method.

our aei assay also compares favorably to previously developed high-throughput methods. several studies have described aei assays that are based on differential hybridization in microarrays  <cit> . while each of these assays is capable of detecting many thousands of differentially expressed transcripts in a single experiment, two of the studies  <cit>  reported that reliable aei could only be detected for linear aei ratios greater than  <dig> . the other two studies  <cit>  described an assay that lacked a pcr amplification step, potentially limiting the ability to use the assay to measure aei ratios for rare mrna transcripts in brain.

in addition to microarray-based assays, high-throughput aei assays based on pcr and second-generation dna sequencing have also recently been described  <cit> . main bj et al.  <cit>  developed an aei assay similar in design to ours, which they successfully used to analyze cis- and trans-regulation of five drosophila simulans genes. zhang k et al.  <cit>  and lee et al  <cit>  established a "digital rna allotyping" assay, based on deep sequencing of "padlock" oligonucleotide probes designed to distinguish alleles of  <dig>  exonic snps . in this assay, genotyping calls were based on a minimum of  <dig> sequencing reads and aei ratios for mrnas expressed in human cells were based on a minimum of  <dig> sequencing reads.

several additional studies have used whole transcriptome sequencing   <cit>  strategies for genomic-scale detection of aei  <cit> . although this approach provides valuable information about the spectrum of mrna in specific tissues, including information concerning the expression of splicing variants, the depth of coverage is usually not sufficient to obtain accurate aei ratios. although several studies calculated aei ratios based on as few as  <dig> sequencing reads, fontanillas et al.  <cit> , using  <dig> sequencing technology to quantify mrna expression in drosophila, established that  <dig> to  <dig>  sequencing reads are required to accurately quantify aei ratios. this range is consistent with the results of our analysis of experimental error as a function of sequencing reads .

to date, three major studies have used microarray-based mrna expression assays combined with genome-wide genotyping to quantify mrna expression and identify eqtl's for genes expressed in human brain  <cit> . although each of these studies yielded important information concerning mrnas that could be detected, each also lacked the sensitivity to detect mrnas for many important candidate disease genes.

myers et al.  <cit>  used the illumina humanrefseq- <dig> expression beadchip system to quantify levels of  <dig>  transcripts in rna isolated from  <dig> independent samples of human cortex. screening snps located within approximately  <dig>  m bp chromosomal segments centered on each gene for correlations between genotype  with mrna expression yielded significant associations for  <dig> snp-transcript pairs , with the majority of the associated snps located within  <dig> kb of the transcript. although each of these cis-associations was significant after correction for snps tested in the same region, only two genes, kif1b and ipp, remained significant after corrections for multiple testing for all snps-transcript pairs that were studied. furthermore, with the exception of mapt  <cit> , no genes previously demonstrated to exhibit aei in human cerebral cortex in pcr-based aei assays, including dtnbp <dig>  <cit> , comt  <cit> , gnb1l  <cit> , tbx <dig>  <cit> , oprm <dig>  <cit> , drd <dig>  <cit> , and chrna <dig>  <cit>  were included in the list of nominally significant cis snp-transcript pairs.

in a follow-up study by the same group, webster et al  <cit>  used more stringent inclusion procedures for expressed transcripts, analyzing  <dig> transcripts in  <dig> late-onset alzheimer's disease  cases and  <dig> control brain samples. again, none of the aei-positive genes listed above was correlated with a snp located in the region of the gene, although a snp located on chromosome  <dig> was weakly correlated with expression of gnb1l mrna in the set of ad brain samples .

using expression data from  <dig> brain samples available on the stanley medical research institute online genomics database , in-house genotyping on affymetrix human genome u133a microarrays, and careful pre-screening of the of the expression and genotyping data to eliminate the effects of confounding variables, liu et al.,  <cit>  identified  <dig> snp-expression probeset pairs  that showed significant "region-wide" association . among these,  <dig> snp-expression probeset pairs  also showed significant "phenotype-wide" association .

although the study of liu et al., identified more genes that are regulated by cis-acting genetic elements compared to the study of myers et al., with the exceptions of gstm <dig>  <cit>   and comt  <cit>  , genes previously shown in pcr-based assays to have significant aei in human cortex were not detected. as noted by the authors, the microarray-based expression assays also did not detect mrna levels sufficient for analysis for many additional neuropsychiatric disorder candidate genes.

among the  <dig> genes examined in the present study, mapt was reported by myers et al.  <cit>  to have significant p-values, but the remaining  <dig> were not detected. in addition to gnb1l, webster et al.  <cit>  reported correlations between transcript levels and trans-snps for an additional three of our candidate genes, clu, npy and picalm, but no correlating cis-snps. in the study of liu et al  <cit> , four of our candidate genes, htr2a, lrp <dig>  ntan <dig> and gria <dig>  attained significant "region-wide" p-values, but not "phenotype-wide" p-values,  <dig> genes were not significant at either level, and  <dig> were not detected at levels sufficient for analysis.

taken together, the results of these three studies strongly suggest that pcr-based mrna expression assays will prove to be the method of choice for investigating genetic regulation of many important disease candidate genes in human brain. an important limitation of this method that should be mentioned, however, is that some candidate genes lack suitable msnps for aei measurements or contain only msnps with very low heterozygosity. for such genes, the traditional approach of looking for correlations between relative mrna expression  genotypes of candidate regulatory snps is the next-best option.

by contrast to previously published studies, our study suffers somewhat from an "embarrassment of riches" in that a very large percentage of our genes showed differential mrna expression among the samples tested. for example, previous genome-wide studies of eqtl's and allele-specific expression  yielded estimates for differentially regulated genes in the range of  <dig> - 54%  <cit> . by contrast, studies focusing on sets of candidate disease genes, have consistently detected higher percentages of genes showing aei: greater than 50%  <cit> . the observation that candidate genes are enriched for genes that show allele-specific differences in mrna expression is consistent with the hypothesis that variation in gene expression contributes to susceptibility to complex diseases  <cit> . consistent with this idea, a recent study showed that putative schizophrenia susceptibility alleles are enriched for alleles that influence mrna expression in human brain  <cit> .

in addition to focusing on leading candidate genes for schizophrenia, alzheimer's disease and drug addition, another reason for the high percentage of genes showing aei in our study is the accuracy of our assay, which allows small deviations from  <dig>  to be detected with confidence. if experimental error based on sequencing read number is taken as the sole standard, our assay reliably detects aei ratios was small as  <dig> ±  <dig> . taking ±  <dig>  as the cut-off, almost all of our  <dig> candidate genes show aei in at least one sample. these observations suggest that small allele-specific deviations from  <dig>  are nearly ubiquitous and raise the question concerning when allele-specific differences in mrna expression become biologically meaningful.

certainly the existence of aei is not equally important for all genes. rather, biologically important aei is likely to be restricted to genes that encode proteins that are limiting for important biological processes. an example of such a gene is tph <dig>  which encodes tryptophan hydroxylase- <dig>  the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of serotonin in the brain  <cit> . for such "dose-sensitive" genes, even small changes in mrna expression may have a significant biological effect, if the changes in mrna are reflected in changes in protein level and/or enzymatic activity.

a good example of a dose-sensitive gene that does not encode an enzyme is app, encoding amyloid precursor protein, the precursor of the toxic peptide aβ, which accumulates in the brains of patients with alzheimer's disease   <cit> . duplication of the app gene, as the result of rare chromosomal duplications or, as in the case of down's syndrome, duplication of the entire chromosome  <dig>  is strongly associated with early-onset ad  <cit> . rare promoter mutations that modestly increase app expression are also linked to early-onset ad  <cit> . if duplication of app, which may increase mrna expression by 50%, can have a dramatic effect on the risk and age of onset of ad, it is not unlikely that smaller increases in mrna expression, e.g., 10% - 40%, contribute to the more common late-onset ad . the same argument holds for genes encoding enzymes and other proteins that function in the production, degradation, clearance and deposition of aβ. clearly analysis of as many genes as possible in these pathways and estimating their combined effects will be important to assessing the relative susceptibility to ad. we believe that our assay provides the optimal balance between throughput and sensitivity that will be useful for investigating sets of genes that function within specific biological pathways implicated in ad and other neuropsychiatric disorders.

one of the major implications our aei measurements and mathematical modeling is that, for many genes, mrna expression is a "complex phenotype," involving  <dig>   <dig> or more cis-acting regulatory variants . these results are consistent with detailed studies showing that specific genes are regulated by multiple cis- and trans-acting variants  <cit> . based upon our modeling, at least two cis-acting regulatory variants are required to account for the observed spectrum of gnb1l log2aei ratios in our brain samples. this implies that predicting high- and low-expression mrna will require the identification of two variants, or, alternatively, two "indicator"  snps that are tightly linked to these variants and accurately predict high- and low-mrna expression. haplotypes comprised of high- or low-expression alleles of regulatory variants or isnps would provide the best genetic markers to test the hypothesis that differential expression of gnb1l contributes to risk of developing schizophrenia. one of the major goals of our aei studies is to identify the best possible genetic markers for association studies for this and other candidate neuropsychiatric disorder genes.

in summary, we believe that the aei assay and molecular modeling described in this study will provide useful tools for investigating the genetic basis of complex diseases, including major neuropsychiatric disorders. these methods should be immediately useful for investigating, in a comprehensive manner, the possible contributions of genes that function within specific biological pathways and systems that contribute to disease. they should also be useful for comparing the regulation of specific genes in developing and mature brain  <cit> , investigating region- and cell-type specific mrna expression  <cit> , integrating information about expression and splice variants  <cit>  and investigating epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we describe a novel, pcr and next-generation dna sequencing-based method for quantifying allelic expression imbalance  of mrna expression in human brain. we show that this assay produced detailed and highly reproducible measurements of aei ratios for  <dig> neuropsychiatric disease candidate genes. we also demonstrate that population distributions of log2-transformed aei ratios for individual gene/marker snp pairs can provide important information concerning the number, location and effect size of regulatory variants that influence mrna expression. taken together, our assay and mathematical modeling provide powerful tools for analyzing the genetic regulation of candidate disease genes and should be useful for investigating how regulatory genetic variants contribute to complex human disorders.
