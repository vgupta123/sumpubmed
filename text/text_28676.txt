BACKGROUND
there is increasing interest in exploring the therapeutic potential of alternative antibody  classes to igg, which to date has been the most popular choice, with over  <dig> examples currently in clinical trials for the treatment of diverse cancers, infectious diseases and auto-immune conditions  <cit> . we recently developed a novel humanized mouse model to show that human igg <dig> specific for plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 1- <dig>  could protect animals from malaria in passive transfer experiments  <cit> . however there are numerous drawbacks to using igg-based therapies in malaria, including competition for fcr binding, from high levels of parasite-induced non-specific igg  <cit> , that warrant the exploration of other serum ab classes for use against infections of blood.

fcαri  targeting with iga could offer potential for controlling malaria with therapeutic antibodies  <cit> . unlike igm, igg and ige, which are implicated in immune evasion  <cit> , placental malaria  <cit>  and severe malaria respectively  <cit> , iga has not been implicated in malaria pathology, arguing for its consideration in ab therapy. although a direct role for murine iga in killing of rodent malaria parasites has not been investigated in vivo because mice lack an equivalent of human fcαri, plasmodium-specific iga has been detected at high levels in serum  <cit> , and breast milk  <cit> , in humans from endemic areas.

ligation of the myeloid fcαri induces cytokine release and can stimulate a respiratory burst  <cit> , and fcαri is better than fcγrs at triggering lysis of ab-targeted tumors as well as phagocytosis of pathogens coated with abs, both in humans and mice  <cit> . human fcαri is expressed on the majority of white blood cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, platelets and nk cells, suggesting it to be an ideal target for systemic iga-mediated therapy  <cit> . the finding that fcαri is a discrete modulator of the immune system mediating both anti- and pro-inflammatory functions indicates that further exploration of the role of human iga in malaria is necessary  <cit> . we recently described a mandatory role for human fcαri in mediating protection from tuberculosis using recombinant human iga  <cit> .

to address the role of human iga in malaria, we generated a recombinant iga recognizing the pfmsp <dig> epitope, matched to a human igg <dig> shown previously to transfer passive protection in the fcγri  transgenic mouse model  <cit> . this recombinant iga was then tested in passive transfer experiments for efficacy in controlling malaria in vivo in human fcαri  transgenic mice.

RESULTS
 <dig>  characterization of pfmsp119-specific human iga
pfmsp119-specific human iga isolated from hek-293t transfectant culture supernatants by affinity-chromatography appeared pure . it ran ahead of recombinant anti-nip polymeric iga <dig> and igm under native conditions , suggesting that it is mainly monomeric, a conclusion supported by size-exclusion chromatographic analysis . the anti-nip antibodies are in polymeric form having been produced in j-chain expressing transfectants. on reducing sds-page gels, the recombinant iga resolved into heavy and light chain bands of the anticipated molecular mass . the heavy chain was recognized by an isotype-specific ab. the recombinant human iga recognized a p. falciparum msp119-gst fusion protein in elisas and by indirect ifa produced a characteristic pattern of msp <dig> reactivity in schizonts, merozoites, and ring-stage parasites from p. falciparum and plasmodium berghei parasites transgenic for pfmsp <dig> . importantly, surface plasmon resonance  analysis revealed no reduction in affinity for pfmsp <dig> when compared with the parental igg <dig> antibody . the binding constants remain essentially the same, and although the affinity for pfmsp <dig> is less than that of a well characterized mouse monoclonal antibody   <dig>  specific for pfmsp <dig> , it is still appreciable.



methodology described in refs  <cit> .

 <dig>  iga <dig> triggers pfmsp119-specific neutrophil nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate  oxidase activation through fcαri cross-linking
we next assessed the ability of this novel iga to interact with human fcαri and induce nadph oxidase activation  and degranulation in human blood neutrophils . for neutrophils, luminol chemiluminescence provides a read out of nadph oxidase activation and myeloperoxidase release  <cit> . when attached to pfmsp119-gst-coated plates, the human iga induced significantly greater respiratory bursts than if the iga was coated directly to the bottom of the plate in the absence of antigen , suggesting that binding to antigen allows the iga to be presented to neutrophil fcαri in an optimal configuration for receptor cross-linking and triggering of functional responses. we have observed that this iga induces greater respiratory bursts from human neutrophils than the epitope-matched human igg <dig> from which this ab was derived  <cit> . this ability of human iga to outperform human igg <dig> at inducing free oxygen radicals and activation of human neutrophils has also been observed for human iga recognizing the homologous antigen from plasmodium yoelii  <cit> .

 <dig>  passive transfer of human iga into wild type or human fcαri  transgenic mice has no effect on the course of a malaria infection
because fcαri is absent in mice due to a translocation event in the leukocyte receptor complex, we tested the ability of the human iga to protect from malaria using human fcαri transgenic mice  <cit> . these mice have been used to show protection from mucosally administered pathogens but have not been directly investigated in relation to blood parasites or in the context of human iga administered systemically  <cit> . blood granulocytes and a proportion of monocytes from these transgenic mice constitutively express functional human fcαri and bind human iga . in vivo experiments with p. berghei transgenic for pfmsp <dig> highlighted that three intraperitoneal  inoculations of iga  was unable to suppress a lethal blood stage challenge infection in these animals in contrast to previous observations with the epitope-matched human igg <dig> passively administered into human fcγri  transgenic animals  <cit>  .

 <dig>  passive transfer of pfmsp119-specific human iga <dig> into mice induces tnf-α and mouse anti-human antibody  responses in some animals
we observed that animals passively immunised with pfmsp119-specific human iga by the i.p. route showed greater adverse clinical signs according to the laboratory animal science association  indices, including severe piloerection & lethargy, after challenge with malaria parasites than control groups of animals. to investigate the underlying basis for these observed detrimental effects of the passively transferred human iga we analyzed serum cytokines responses in all the animals using the cytometric bead array mouse th1/th <dig> 10plex kit  on day  <dig> post-challenge when all mice were killed. we observed significantly elevated levels of tnf-α in animals treated with human iga compared with control animals given pbs, irrespective of genetic background , although extreme levels of tnf-α were only seen in four of the fourteen mice tested. the difference in tnf-α levels between the transgenic and non-transgenic groups administered iga was not statistically significant . no significant differences over baseline levels of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ifn-γ, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  gm-csf were observed between the groups, although il- <dig> and il-1α were raised in animals given iga when compared with pbs . co-administration of mab 2h <dig>  a mouse mab that binds to human fcαri blocking the human iga binding site  <cit> , at the time of iga delivery, failed to dramatically alter the course of parasitemia  or the development of tnf-α responses . the induction of elevated tnf-α was therefore not dependent on the presence of the human fcαri transgene, but more likely due to some uncharacterized effect of the pfmsp119-specific iga, a result supported by the raised tnf-α levels observed in non-transgenic animals also given the antibody. these high levels of tnf-α were present despite the absence of detectable pfmsp119-specific iga in the final bleeds , confirming that the half-life of the passively transferred human iga in mice is less than that for human igg <dig>  all animals given pfmsp119-specific iga , also made significant mouse anti-human iga responses on day  <dig> as assessed by elisa , suggesting that the high levels of inflammatory cytokines observed may be a consequence of mounting an anti-human iga immune response and are not the result of malaria infection per se, as these cytokines were not observed in challenged mice given pbs.

discussion
we describe the development of a fully human iga with specificity for a very well characterized epitope on msp <dig> from p. falciparum, useful for dissecting human fc receptor mechanisms involved in immunity to human malaria  <cit> .

this novel iga was generated from a human igg <dig> mab , previously shown to protect human fcγri  transgenic mice  from a lethal challenge with rodent malaria  transgenic for the p. falciparum msp <dig>  antigen  <cit> . the engineered iga recognized parasites in infected erythrocytes and bound pfmsp <dig> with comparable kinetics to that observed with the parental igg <dig> from which it was derived. despite triggering potent and functional in vitro responses the iga failed to protect human fcαri transgenic mice from a malaria infection. although the injected iga is mostly monomeric, and therefore binds transiently to fcαr, immune-complexes formed on engaging pfmsp <dig> on merozoites would be expected to bind avidly to fcαri  <cit> . we also tried without success to passively protect the cd <dig> transgenic animals with sera from rabbits immunized with pfmsp <dig> or plasma from vaccinated humans or humans from endemic regions with significant levels of anti-pfmsp <dig> human iga antibodies by elisa . this is noteworthy, as clinical protection from p. falciparum malaria, has recently been shown to correlate with neutrophil respiratory bursts induced by merozoites opsonized with human serum antibodies  <cit> . this important study demonstrated that immune african sera depleted of igg by protein-g sepharose chromatography , gave negligible activity in their antibody-dependent respiratory burst assays . whilst highlighting an absolute requirement for igg, this finding is however difficult to reconcile with the observed ability here of pfmsp119-specific human iga to induce very effective luminol nadph-oxidase mediated respiratory bursts and degranulation from human blood neutrophils   <cit> .

one explanation for the failure of the iga to protect against malarial challenge may be that it is difficult for iga administered i.p. to leave the peritoneum and reach the circulation and other parts of the body, where any protective effects would presumably be mediated. transfer of igg from peritoneum to other body compartments may be assisted, at least in part, through interaction with fcrn, an igg receptor present on a variety of cell types, capable of bidirectional transport across epithelial surfaces and involved in control of igg turnover  <cit> . iga, in contrast, is unable to bind fcrn, and may be more reliant on diffusion to reach the circulation and distribute within other body compartments. this may also explain why recombinant iga when administered intra-nasally was particularly effective at controlling tuberculosis  <cit> .

another explanation for the lack of in vivo efficacy may be that the administered iga was cleared very rapidly from the mouse, before it had sufficient opportunity to mediate any protective effects. unlike humans, where the half-life of the chiefly monomeric serum iga is approximately 4- <dig> days  <cit> , in mice monomeric iga has a half-life of just  <dig> hours  <cit> . igg is cleared much more slowly due to interaction with fcrn, and therefore when administered i.p. presumably has a much greater opportunity for functional impact.

a third possibility is that the fcαri in the transgenic mice is not expressed on the cell types critical for protection at sufficiently high levels, or on a sufficient proportion of these cells, or on cells located within the required body compartment. for example, in contrast to the situation in humans, only a subpopulation of the monocytes of the transgenic mice express human fcαri, and peritoneal macrophages and platelets exhibit no expression  <cit> .

these three possibilities, taken together, suggest that the fcαri transgenic mouse, although undoubtedly the best model currently available, may not afford the means to fully assess the capability of human iga to offer protection in the human setting.

this is the first recombinant human iga to target pfmsp <dig>  however, in exploring the role of iga in malaria, others have tested recombinant human iga <dig> and iga <dig> localized on the surface of polystyrene beads in a two-step antibody-dependent cellular inhibition  assay  <cit> . in contrast to human igg <dig> and igg <dig>  neither iga <dig> or iga <dig> were found to stimulate in vitro adci of malaria parasites by human monocytes  <cit> . human monocytes express fcαri and induce parasite inhibitory tnf-α  <cit> , and may therefore have been expected to engage in adci. this finding is in keeping with the lack of an in vivo effect seen here, the data suggesting neutrophils rather than monocytes may fulfill this role, and with either human iga targeting the p. berghei pfmsp <dig> transgenic, or earlier against p. yoelii msp <dig>  <cit> . however, it will be necessary to generate epitope-matched murine igas  to determine if mouse monocytes/neutrophils are capable of adci/adrb and whether mouse iga can protect against rodent malarias in vivo. although no counterpart for human fcαri is known in mice, mouse macrophages do bind mouse iga, and mac-2/galectin- <dig>  has been suggested to be the receptor involved  <cit> . interestingly, gal- <dig> is known to bind ige, and there may be some mileage in developing recombinant ige to investigate malaria infection, as mouse ige can also bind fcγriv  on mouse monocytes  <cit> . intriguingly, murine ige has been shown to confer protection from p. berghei in c57bl/ <dig> mice, and elevated anti-malarial ige in asymptomatic individuals has been shown to associate with a reduced risk of subsequent clinical malaria in humans  <cit> .

we observed that a small proportion of mice given the recombinant human iga preparation in the context of a malaria infection developed significant mouse anti-human antibody responses  with elevated tnf-α within  <dig> days of the last iga dose, which were not observed in control animals challenged with malaria . our observations suggest that the responses are not dependent on the presence of the fcαri transgene and therefore may represent a reaction to the administered iga itself. further experiments will be necessary to clarify whether the response noted is peculiar to the particular iga preparation used which may contain undetected levels of aggregates, or the specificity of the iga for the co-administered malarial parasite that might result in particular cross-linking events, or is a general effect associated with human iga administration to mice in the absence of malaria challenge infection.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, a novel pfmsp119-specific iga did not show protective capability against parasite challenge in mice transgenic for human fcαri. while this finding may indicate that iga does not play a major role in protection against malaria, we cannot rule out the possibility that the findings reflect certain shortcomings of the mouse model used. thus important differences in iga half-life, iga bio-distribution, and fcαri expression profile between the transgenic mice and humans may have compromised the antibody's ability to mediate protective effects, and further experimentation will be required to fully dissect the role of iga in human malaria.
