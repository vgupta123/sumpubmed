BACKGROUND
insect mitochondrial genomes  are circular double-stranded molecules 15–18 kb in size that usually code for  <dig> genes:  <dig> protein-coding genes , two ribosomal rna genes , and  <dig> transfer rna genes   <cit> . in addition, mitogenomes usually contain a large non-coding region  that contains essential regulatory elements for transcription and replication  <cit> . in the past decade, mitogenome sequencing has increased dramatically and these sequences have been extensively used in the study of molecular evolution, phylogenetics, phylogeography and population genetics .

pentatomoidea  consists of about  <dig>  known species in  <dig> families, of which pentatomidae is the largest family containing over  <dig>  species in ca.  <dig> genera  <cit> . most species of this superfamily are economically important as agricultural pests, whereas some are used as biological control agents. gapud  <cit>  used morphological characters to investigate the phylogenetic relationships within pentatomoidea and found urostylididae to be the sister group to all remaining pentatomoid species. however, xu  <cit>  argued that cydnidae is the earliest diverging group within pentatomoidea based on morphological data. grazia et al.  <cit>  performed the first phylogenetic analysis within pentatomoidea based on combined morphological and molecular data, and confirmed that urostylididae is sister to the other pentatomoid species. lis et al.  <cit>  used two mitochondrial genes  to examine the position of dinidoridae within pentatomoidea, and identified dinidoridae as monophyletic and sister to the tessaratomidae. analysis of the partial cox <dig> sequence, however, did not support a close affinity between dinidoridae and tessaratomidae  <cit> . currently, the monophyly of pentatomoidea has been strongly supported in a large number of studies that have been based on morphological and molecular analyses . although considerable research effort has been expended on pentatomoidea, phylogenetic relationships within the superfamily are still unresolved and controversial  <cit> . much of the previous work on pentatomoid relationships has focused mainly on morphological characteristics, and robust phylogeny remains to be explored using mitogenomic data.

to date, only  <dig> complete or nearly complete mitogenomes have been sequenced for pentatomomorpha , of which nine are from pentatomoidea. the number of sequenced pentatomoid mitogenomes is still quite limited compared to the species-richness of pentatomoidea and restricts our understanding of evolution in pentatomoid species at the genomic level. in addition, the accurate delimitation of mitochondrial genes may be difficult and error prone when annotated mitogenomes are not available from closely related species . therefore, it is important to sequence more mitogenomes from pentatomoidea, especially from closely related species, to improve the accuracy of mitochondrial gene and to enhance our understanding of molecular evolution and phylogenetic relationships.

in the present study, we sequenced and annotated the mitogenomes of eurydema gebleri  and rubiconia intermedia  from the family pentatomidae. these two species are important alfalfa pests in china. we compared the newly sequenced mitogenomes with nine previously published sequences to check and refine the original annotation of gene boundaries. we provided a detailed comparative analysis of eleven pentatomoid mitogenomes, including nucleotide composition, codon usage, rna secondary structure, evolutionary pattern among  <dig> pcgs, and structural elements within the a + t-rich regions. finally, we evaluated the phylogenetic utility of mitogenomic sequence data at the taxonomic levels of pentatomomorpha, pentatomoidea and pentatomidae.

RESULTS
genome organization
the complete mitogenome of e. gebleri  and the nearly complete mitogenome of r. intermedia  were obtained . the region that we failed to sequence in r. intermedia is located between rrns and nad <dig>  this area of the mitogenome is known from other insects and contains notable base composition bias, high numbers of tandem repeats, and stable stem-loop structures. these features may result in disruption of pcr and sequencing reactions, as has been reported in other hemipterans . the e. gebleri mitogenome is a typical circular dna molecule and its map is shown in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> circular map of the mitochondrial genome of eurydema gebleri. protein coding and ribosomal genes are shown with standard abbreviations. genes for trnas are abbreviated by a single letter, with s1 = agn, s2 = ucn, l1 = cun, and l2 = uur. genes coded in the j-strand  are red or orange colored. genes coded in the n-strand  are green or cyan colored. numbers at gene junctions indicate the length of small non-coding regions where negative numbers indicate overlap between genes



we found that the boundaries of some genes are incorrectly delimited in the original genbank sequence files of some pentatomoid species. these errors could have a significant impact on comparative and evolutionary mitogenomic analyses. therefore, we revised the annotations of these genes, including those encoding for pcgs, rrnas, trnas and a + t-rich regions . the re-annotated sequences were used for our analyses.

the completely sequenced mitogenomes from pentatomoidea contain a typical set of  <dig> mitochondrial genes  and an a + t-rich region. gene arrangement is highly conserved within pentatomoidea and is identical to the gene order of the putative ancestral insect mitogenome  <cit> . the mitogenomes of eight completely sequenced pentatomoid species display moderate size variation, ranging from  <dig>  bp in megacopta cribraria to  <dig>  bp in nezara viridula  with most of the size variation being attributed to the variety of non-coding regions, primarily due to length mutations in the a + t-rich regions . gene overlaps have been observed at several gene junctions, varying in size from  <dig> nucleotides in dolycoris baccarum to  <dig> nucleotides in coptosoma bifaria . the longest overlap  exists between trnw and trnc, whereas two pcg pairs atp8/atp <dig> and nad4l/nad <dig> overlap seven nucleotides, in all pentatomoids sequenced so far, except d. baccarum. in the d. baccarum mitogenome, atp <dig> overlaps with atp <dig> by only one nucleotide . the overlap sequences in the three gene junctions are highly conserved among all sequenced pentatomoid mitogenomes .table  <dig> list of the species included in the present study

nucleotide composition and codon usage
all analyzed pentatomoid mitogenomes are consistently biased towards being at rich, ranging from  <dig>  % in m. cribraria to  <dig>  % in n. viridula . the lowest a + t content is always found in pcgs, whereas the highest a + t content is found in rrna-encoding genes  or a + t-rich regions . a + t content also varies for each codon position in pcgs; the third codon position has an a + t content higher than that of the first and second positions . at- and gc-skews in pentatomoid mitogenomes are similar to patterns typically found in most insect mitogenomes , i.e. positive at-skew and negative gc-skew for the j-strand and the reverse pattern in the n-strand  <cit> . the pcgs on the j-strand are slightly t- or a-skewed and moderately c-skewed, whereas the n-strand encoded pcgs are all markedly t-skewed and g-skewed. opposite gc-skew for pcgs between j- and n-strands has also been reported in other insects  <cit> . there is a marked negative at-skew in the second codon positions of pcgs on the j-strand, in the three codon positions of pcgs on the n-strand, and in rrnas. the a + t-rich region, the second and the third positions of pcgs on the j-strand have a markedly negative gc-skew, whereas a significantly biased positive gc-skew is present in the first codon positions of pcgs on both the j- and n-strands, in the third codon positions of pcgs on the n-strand, in rrnas, and in trnas.

nucleotide composition bias is also reflected in the codon usage pattern. relative synonymous codon frequencies  reveal that four- and two-fold degenerate codon usage is biased to use more as and ts than gs and cs in the third codon positions . among  <dig> amino acids encoding codons in invertebrate mitochondria, some gc-rich codons have never been utilized in some species . in the e. gebleri mitogenome, the four at-rich codons, ttt-phe , tta-leu , att-ile , and ata-met , are the most frequently used codons. comparative analyses among other sequenced pentatomoid species also reveal a similar pattern, with values ranging from  <dig>  % in m. cribraria to  <dig>  % in n. viridula. differences in the four most frequently used codons in pentatomoid species seem to be directly linked to the a + t content of all pcgs , as has been reported in other insects and chelicerates  <cit> .

to further investigate the codon usage bias among pentatomoid species, we analyzed the correlations between enc , cbi , the g + c content of all codons, and the g + c content of the 3rd codon positions . we found a positive correlation between enc and g + c content for all codons   and the 3rd codon positions  . furthermore, a negative correlation was found between cbi and g + c content for all codons  , g + c content of the 3rd codon positions   and enc  . these results are consistent with prevailing neutral mutational theories, in that genomic g + c content is the most significant factor in determining codon bias among organisms  <cit> .fig.  <dig> evaluation of codon bias in the mitochondrial genomes of eleven pentatomoid species. enc, effective number of codons  <cit> ; cbi, codon bias index  <cit> ; g + c%, g + c content of all codon positions; 3 %, g + c content of the third codon positions



protein-coding genes
we re-annotated nine pcgs  for nine previously sequenced pentatomoid species , which changed the size of the genes and the location of the start and stop codons. for nad <dig> and nad <dig>  the start codons were difficult to determine due to high sequence variation among pentatomoid species. therefore, we annotated these two genes to have the largest open reading frame, but we did not allow them to overlap with trnm, except for c. bifaria .

in pentatomoid mitogenomes, most pcgs initiated with a typical start codon , but cox <dig> always begins with ttg . in addition, ctg , atca , gtg , and ttg  are also proposed as initiation codons. while most pcgs end with the termination codon tan, truncated termination codons ta or t are also common . truncated stop codons are common in metazoan mitogenomes and may be corrected via post-transcriptional polyadenylation  <cit> .

in order to investigate the evolutionary patterns among the mitochondrial pcgs in pentatomoid species, the values of ka, ks, and ka/ks  were calculated for each pcg, respectively . the ks of nad <dig> was the highest, while the values of ka and ω for atp <dig> were the highest. at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, four genes  had the lowest evolutionary rates, suggesting that they are potentially useful barcoding markers. the ω values for all pcgs were far lower than one , indicating that these genes are evolving under purifying selection. therefore, all mitochondrial pcgs could be used to investigate phylogenetic relationships within pentatomoidea. furthermore, a negative correlation has been found between ω and the g + c content of each pcg , indicating that variation in g + c content probably causes the different evolutionary patterns among genes.fig.  <dig> evolutionary rates of  <dig> protein-coding genes in the mitochondrial genomes of eleven pentatomoid species. the left y-axis provides the substitution rate of mitochondrial gene, while the right y-axis provides the g + c content. synonymous nucleotide substitutions per synonymous site  and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions per nonsynonymous site  are calculated using the kumar method  <cit> . the standard error estimates are obtained by a bootstrap procedure 



transfer rna genes
we re-annotated six trnas, trng , trna , trnr , trnf and trnh , and trns <dig>  . the secondary structures of these six trnas are well conserved, though their sequences are the most variable among  <dig> trnas . all  <dig> trnas typical of metazoan mitogenomes are present in most pentatomoid mitogenomes we assessed, with an average size ranging from 64 ±  <dig>  bp to 73 ±  <dig>  bp . in the e. gebleri mitogenome, twenty trnas possess a canonical cloverleaf secondary structure composed of four arms with conserved size, whereas the remaining two trnas  appear to lack the dihydrouridine  arm . similar structures have also been observed in other pentatomoid mitochondrial sequences and conserved nucleotides for each trna within pentatomoidea and pentatomidae are given in fig.  <dig>  the sequences and structures of anticodon arms, aminoacyl acceptor stems, and dhu stems are highly conversed, especially within pentatomidae, and most of the nucleotide variation is restricted to dhu and pseudouridine  loops and variable arms, with obvious indel polymorphisms .fig.  <dig> putative secondary structures of the  <dig> trna genes identified in the mitochondrial genome of eurydema gebleri. all trna genes are shown in the order of occurrence in the mitochondrial genome starting from trni. the nucleotides showing 100 % identity within pentatomoidea and pentatomidae are marked with red and purple colors, respectively. bars indicate watson–crick base pairings, and dots between g and u pairs mark canonical base pairings in trna



the loss of the dhu arm in trns <dig>  has been considered a typical feature of metazoan mitogenomes  <cit> . however, we found that trns <dig> in eleven pentatomoid mitogenomes possesses an unusual anticodon stem  with a bulged nucleotide . this is an unusual phenomenon, but has also been observed in the dhu arm in other true bugs . in u. quadrinotata and e. cupreus, trnv has an extremely short  dhu stem, suggesting that this trna may have lost the dhu arm, as has been observed in other pentatomoid species . in insect mitogenomes, apart for the loss of the dhu arm in trns <dig>  truncated trna structures have only been found in cecidomyiids  <cit> , where each trna gene has lost the entire tψc arm and the 3′ end of the aminoacyl acceptor stem  <cit> . the loss of the dhu arm of trnas is an uncommon occurrence, but this phenomenon has also been reported for some mitochondrial trnas from chelicerates  <cit> . although functional trnas that lack a dhu arm have not been found in insects, it has been reported that in the nematode ascaris suumthe trnas may lack either the dhu or the tψc arm and retain functionality  <cit> .

ribosomal rna genes
as in other insect mitogenomes, pentatomoid mitogenomes have two genes encoding the large and small rrna subunits  that are located at a conserved position between trnl <dig>  and trnv, and between trnv and the a + t-rich region, respectively . we re-annotated the boundaries of rrns  and rrnl  . the length of rrnl varies from  <dig>  bp in u. quadrinotata to  <dig>  bp in m. gibbulus, whereas the largest and smallest rrns genes are 814 bp in n. viridula and 779 bp in m. gibbulus. therefore, there was not substantial size variation between rrnas within the family pentatomidae .

in this study the secondary structures of the rrnas of e. gebleri were constructed following the models proposed for other insects, and compared to other pentatomoid species. the secondary structures of rrnl and rrns inferred for e. gebleri have similar stem-loop structures as those proposed for d. melanogaster  <cit> , a. mellifera  <cit> , m. sexta  <cit>  and other hemipterans . the secondary structure of rrnl consists of six structural domains  and  <dig> helices , whereas the secondary structure of rrns contains three domains and  <dig> helices .fig.  <dig> predicted secondary structure for the rrnl in the mitochondrial genome of eurydema gebleri. the nucleotides showing 100 % identity within pentatomoidea and pentatomidae are marked with red and purple colors, respectively. inferred watson-crick bonds are illustrated by lines, whereas gu bonds are illustrated by dots

in rrnl, domains iv and v are more conserved within pentatomoidea than domains i, ii, and vi. six helices  of rrnl are highly conserved with 0– <dig> nucleotide substitutions. some helices  are highly variable in terms of their sequence and secondary structure, as has been frequently observed in other insects  <cit> .

compared to the 5′-end, the 3′-end of rrns is structurally more conserved within pentatomoidea, especially in the helices h921- <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig>  the helix h <dig> is highly variable between different insects; in fact no consistent structure has been found for this region  <cit> . the estimated secondary structure of h <dig> in e. gebleri consists of a long stem and a short terminal loop, as is also found in stenopirates sp.  <cit>  and c. fallax  <cit> . the other helices  are highly variable and mfold estimates several likely secondary structures due to the sequence’s high a + t bias and several non-canonical base pairs  <cit> . however, the helix h <dig> is well conserved in terms of its sequence and structure within pentatomoidea . although the helix h <dig> has been found in some insects , this helix seems to be absent in the rrns of e. gebleri, as found in stenopirates sp.  <cit>  and c. salicicola  <cit> . in most insects, the helix h <dig> usually forms a short paired stem with a large loop, but this helix in e. gebleri, h <dig> forms a long stem and a very small loop. comparison of this helix among pentatomoid species shows that its nucleotide sequences are highly variable, and thus this structure might be taxon-specific.

non-coding regions
pentatomoid mitogenomes are highly economized in genome size, just as in other animals, and they contain only a few intergenic spacers, most of which are shorter than ten nucleotides . the longest intergenic spacer sequence we found is located between trns <dig>  and nad <dig> in all pentatomoid species, except for m. cribraria and e. gebleri . this intergenic spacer is also present in other insect orders  <cit>  and these sequences have been shown to be the binding site of a transcription termination factor   <cit> . all of the trns2-nad <dig> intergenic spacer sequences observed in pentatomoid mitogenomes are highly conserved and have a conserved motif with significant similarity to the dmttf binding site in d. melanogaster .

the largest non-coding region  in the eight pentatomoid mitogenomes is located at a conserved position as in most insects . a + t-rich regions in the eight pentatomoid mitogenomes have varying lengths, ranging from 984 bp in m. cribraria to  <dig>  bp in u. quadrinotata . a comparison of structures in a + t-rich regions among pentatomoid mitogenomes is shown in fig.  <dig>  with the exception of e. cupreus, a + t-rich regions in the other seven species include large tandem repeats present as two or more copies. in addition, rrns borders a large non-repeat region  that is present in all of the eight species  and its g + c content  is higher than the average g + c content of the whole genome. in most pentatomoid species, tandem repeat sequences contain two types of repeat units and are interrupted by a non-coding region. although pentatomoid a + t-rich regions form several stem-loop structures, no conserved functional motifs could be identified. overall, pentatomoid a + t-rich regions show distinct sequence and structural characteristics, such as varying sizes and differentiated tandem repetitions. these characteristics may be taxon-specific and can potentially be used as genetic markers for evolutionary and population genetic studies of pentatomoid species.fig.  <dig> organization of the a + t-rich region in pentatomoid mitochondrial genomes. the location and copy number of tandem repeats are shown by colored oval with arabic numerals inside. non-repeat regions are indicated by colored box with sequence size inside



phylogenetic analysis
we performed phylogenetic analyses with four datasets  and two inference methods  . we found that tree topologies were sensitive to different datasets and inference methods, and support values were higher in the bi tree than in the ml tree using the same dataset. although sequences of two rrnas and  <dig> trnas have been used in previous hemipteran phylogenetic studies , our analyses with rnas  do not improve branch support in ml and bi trees, but actually reduce support for some branches. phylogenetic analyses that included rna genes did not recover a sister-group relationship between the aradoidea and the trichophora. in contrast, analyses based on two pcg datasets  strongly support the sister-group relationship of aradoidea and the trichophora, and place pentatomoidea as sister to the remainder of the trichophora, as previous analyses based on the morphological and molecular data have indicated . substitution saturation can have negative effects on phylogenetic reconstructions, but the exclusion of saturated sites  did not improve resolution in our analyses . these results indicate that rna data might be unsuitable for reconstructing the organismal evolutionary relationships within pentatomomorpha.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationships among five pentatomomorpha superfamilies based on the concatenated nucleotide sequences of  <dig> mitochondrial protein-coding genes . numbers on branches are bayesian posterior probabilities  and bootstrap values . asterisk  indicates pp =  <dig>  and bs = 100



all analyses consistently recover the five superfamilies  with high support . the clades have previously been established in pentatomomorpha as monophyletic groups. incongruent phylogenetic relationships within eutrichophora  have been frequently observed in other molecular studies  <cit> . pyrrhocoroidea and coreoidea are consistently recovered as sister, except in a bi analysis of pcg123rt, and this is congruent with traditional taxonomic hypotheses based on morphology  <cit>  and other molecular phylogenetic studies  <cit> . however, this result is different from the results of  <cit>  and  <cit>  using mitogenomic data, where lygaeoidea and coreoidea are sister. within pentatomoidea, all analyses strongly support a relationship of )))), which is consistent with previous studies based on morphological and molecular data  <cit> . furthermore, the monophyly of pentatomidae is also strongly supported in all analyses, and a phylogenetic relationship of )) within pentatominae is recognized in most analyses .

although some conflicting results are observed from different datasets and inference methods, our results largely agree with the traditional morphological classification and recent molecular studies, suggesting that mitogenome sequences are promising genetic markers for resolving phylogenetic relationships at various taxonomic levels of pentatomomorpha. further researches with denser taxon sampling and molecular markers from across the nuclear genome, as well as appropriate phylogenetic inference methods are needed to provide more precise estimates for phylogenetic relationships within pentatomomorpha and heteroptera.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we sequenced and annotated the complete mitogenome of eurydema gebleri and the nearly complete mitogenome of rubiconia intermedia. we present the first comparative analysis of eleven pentatomoid mitogenomes and our results show that gene content, gene arrangement, base composition, codon usage, rna structure, and mitochondrial transcription termination factor sequences are highly conserved in pentatomoids, especially among closely-related species. although most trnas have a canonical cloverleaf secondary structure, abnormal trnas are also present in pentatomoid mitogenomes. phylogenetic relationships within pentatomomorpha based on mitogenomic data are consistent with the traditional morphological classification, suggesting that mitogenome sequences are useful for resolving phylogenetic relationships at various taxonomic levels. sequencing more mitogenomes representing various taxonomic levels, particularly from closely related species, will not only improve the accuracy of annotations for mitochondrial genes, but will also greatly improve our understanding of mitogenomic evolution and phylogenetic relationships in pentatomoids.
