BACKGROUND
identifying the complete set of genes that regulate a biological phenotype is a challenge of systems biology. availability of systems-level protein-protein interaction , gene expression, and functional genomics  data has facilitated the development of integrative computational approaches to uncover genes involved in biological processes  <cit> . integration of c. elegans fg data  <cit>  with existing gene expression and ppi data has facilitated the discovery of co-expressed gene networks  <cit> , early embryogenesis control networks  <cit> , and large-scale protein function networks  <cit> . integrating drosophila rnai datasets with ppi networks helped identify novel functional regulators of biological phenotypes, demonstrating that ppi networks and rnai datasets can be effectively integrated to derive additional functional information from rnai screens  <cit> . application of these methods to mammalian rnai datasets has been more problematic secondary to higher false positive and false negative rates of mammalian rnai screens  <cit> . biological pathways are distinct, experimentally-validated subnetworks of proteins within the larger ppi network that interact with each other by well defined mechanisms to regulate a specific biologic phenotype. while currently available methods can identify components of rnai datasets that interact with each other within ppi networks  <cit> , no method currently exists to determine which of these screen "hits" are novel components of well defined pathways known to regulate the process under study.

numerous studies have identified molecular determinants of pigment variation:  <dig> mouse coat color genes have been identified  <cit>  that coordinately regulate the transcription, translation, and intracellular trafficking of melanogenic enzymes  <cit> . these studies have identified the master regulator of melanocyte transcription microphthalmia-associated transcription factor   <cit> , several melanogenic enzymes  <cit> , and regulators of melanosome formation and trafficking  <cit> . despite these advances, our current understanding of skin and eye color variability is incomplete  <cit> .

recently, we utilized a systems-level fg platform to identify  <dig> novel genes that regulate melanin production, novel regulators of melanin secretion, and novel depigmenting agents  <cit> . notably, our approach failed to identify many known regulators of melanogenesis among our top tier hits, and annotation data failed to identify connections between many screen targets and biological pathways known to regulate melanogenesis. in this study, we apply ppi network topology-based computational methods to identify genes within our fg dataset that are novel components of biological pathways known to regulate melanogenesis.

RESULTS
topological similarity uncovers novel melanogenesis-related regulatory network members within a functional genomics dataset
in this study, we examine the interrelationship between ppi network topology and both known and newly identified biological pathways that regulate melanogenesis. in ppi networks, nodes correspond to proteins and edges represent possible interactions amongst them. to increase the coverage of ppis, we analyze the union of the physical human ppi networks from hprd  <cit> , biogrid  <cit> , and by radivojac et al.  <cit> , consisting of  <dig>  interactions amongst  <dig>  proteins. we characterize the topology of nodes' neighborhoods in the ppi network with their "graphlet degree vectors"   <cit> ; graphlets are small connected induced subgraphs of a network . gdv of a node, also called the node "signature," generalizes the degree of a node that counts how many edges the node touches into the vector of graphlet degrees that counts how many graphlets of a given type, such as a triangle or a square, the node touches . all 2-5-node graphlets, presented in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig> figure s <dig>  are taken into account. clearly, the degree of a node is the first coordinate in this vector, since an edge  is the only 2-node graphlet. to take into account the symmetry groups within a graphlet, the notion of automorphism orbits  is used for all graphlets with 2-5-nodes. for example, it is topologically relevant to distinguish between nodes touching a 3-node linear path  at an end, or at the middle node. by taking into account these symmetries between nodes of a graphlet, there are  <dig> different orbits for 2-5-node graphlets, numbered from  <dig> to  <dig> in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig> figure s <dig>  thus, gdv of a node, describing the complex topological wiring of node's up to "4-deep neighborhood," has  <dig> coordinates  <cit> . we compute pairwise "similarities" between gdvs; higher signature similarity corresponds to higher topological similarity of the nodes' "network surroundings" . we say that two proteins are "signature-similar" if their gdv similarity is above a given threshold. this measure has been used to demonstrate that topologically similar proteins have similar functions  <cit> .

to find proteins topologically similar to known melanogenesis regulators in the context of the ppi network, we compute gdvs for pigment regulators identified in our sirna screen ). as previous studies demonstrated that many known pigment regulators  were not present in our top tier targets but did have some impacts on pigment production  <cit> , we define sprs as genes whose sirnas have some impact on pigment production  .  <dig>  sprs are present in the existing ppi network. also, the existing ppi network contains  <dig> kprs from the espcr database,  <dig> of which are sprs at the same time  <cit> . we note that a choice of a higher z-score threshold might be more appropriate; however, such a choice omitted several kprs from the analyzed dataset and resulted in a limited number of sprs in the dataset that was insufficient for any statistical analysis.

to identify specific melanogenesis regulatory subnetworks hidden in our fg dataset, we identify sprs with similar gdvs in the ppi network, with the hypothesis that some signature-similar sprs would be components of the same protein subnetwork. for each spr, we form a "cluster" containing that protein and all other proteins in the network that are signature-similar to it . thus, the clusters contain proteins that have similar topologies within the ppi network. we measure the statistical significance of sprs to cluster together. we denote by "hit-rate" the percentage of proteins in a cluster that are sprs, excluding the protein for which the cluster was formed . we find that  <dig> of our clusters are statistically significantly enriched with sprs at p-value threshold of spr-enrichment of  <dig>  ; the list of proteins for which the clusters were formed, together with their hit-rates and p-values, is provided in additional file  <dig> table s <dig>  by analyzing random clusters  and by using the same enrichment and statistical significance criteria, we find that it is unlikely to observe  <dig> statistically significantly spr-enriched clusters by chance . note that the relatively low number of statistically significantly spr-enriched clusters is expected due to incompleteness of spr  data set. since the number of sprs  will increase in the future, it is expected that the enrichment of each of the clusters will increase and their p-values will decrease. consequently, the number of statistically significantly enriched clusters will increase as well.

by uncovering clusters that are statistically significantly enriched with sprs, we demonstrate that genes with functional roles in melanogenesis indeed have similar topological signatures in the ppi network. to determine whether any of the sprs are novel components of known melanogenesis regulatory pathways, we examine clusters of  <dig> sprs that are at the same time kprs and choose for further analyses the cluster with the highest hit-rate. the identified cluster is the cluster formed for ednrb. it contains  <dig> proteins in total and its hit-rate is  <dig> %. we analyze this cluster despite that it is not statistically significantly spr-enriched since  its hit-rate could be considered "state of the art" given the noisiness of biological experiments, spr  data set, the ppi network data that we use  <cit> , and  statistically non-significant results may be biologically and scientifically interesting and important, whereas statistically significant results can turn out not to be  <cit> . the fact that five sprs topologically cluster with ednrb  and given that we have previously demonstrated the link between topological and functional similarity  <cit> , we conclude that our fg dataset may contain unappreciated members of biological pathways or subnetworks that regulate melanogenesis. thus, to uncover ednrb's corresponding melanogenesis-related pathway, we form the "ednrb network" by expanding in the ppi network around the proteins in ednrb cluster as follows. the "ednrb network"  contains the set of proteins in ednrb cluster and their direct neighbors, along with all interactions from the human ppi network that exist between these nodes. there are  <dig> nodes in ednrb network : the proteins that are in the cluster part of the network  include  <dig> kprs , <dig> sprs  and  <dig> proteins not detected by our sirna screen ; the proteins that are the neighbors of the cluster proteins in the ednrb network include  <dig> kprs ,  <dig> sprs , and  <dig> proteins that are not detected by our sirna screen. we include direct neighbors of the cluster proteins because the network without them is disconnected. also, since biological pathways are contiguous "linear" structures in ppi networks, including them will aid in detecting new members of a biological pathway.

an alternative approach to finding new pathway members would be to consider simply an spr and its direct neighbors as cluster members, since it has been shown that proteins that are closer in the network  are more likely to be functionally similar  than proteins that are further apart in the network  <cit> . every cluster defined in this way would topologically be somewhere between a "star-like" network structure centered at the chosen spr  and a fully connected network. that is, network clusters obtained with the direct neighborhood approach would have the diameter of either  <dig> or  <dig>  where the diameter is defined as the maximum of shortest path lengths between all node pairs in the network. however, we tested all biological pathways from kegg  <cit>  mapped onto the human ppi network to compare their diameters with the diameters of the direct neighborhood-based clusters. due to the incompleteness of the ppi network data, about 30% of kegg pathways were consisting mainly of isolated edges after they were mapped onto the human ppi network; hence, we removed these pathways from our analysis. for the remaining 70% of the mapped pathways, we found that 93% of them have diameters larger than  <dig>  the distribution of diameters of these pathways was bell-shaped, with the average of  <dig>  and the standard deviation of  <dig> . therefore, since pathways correspond to parts of ppi networks that are of relatively large diameters, the simple direct neighborhood approach is not appropriate for finding new pathway members, since it can only produce subgraphs of small diameters. hence, other approaches should be sought. in contrast, our gdv-based method generates ednrb network of diameter  <dig>  also, since gdvs are based on all up to 5-node graphlets hence covering parts of the ppi network of diameter <  <dig> around an spr of interest, the gdv-based approach is more appropriate for finding new pathway members than the direct neighborhoods.

with our gdv-based approach, in addition to the proteins in the cluster formed for a given spr, we include into the spr's "network"  the direct neighbors of proteins in the cluster to make the network connected; note that by doing so, we are indirectly taking into account the fact that direct neighbors are more likely to be involved in a same biological process than proteins that are further apart in the network  <cit> . for comparison, we perform the equivalent procedure for the direct neighborhood approach and evaluate whether this increases the diameters of such "expanded" direct neighborhood-based subnetworks. however, even if we include direct neighbors of the spr's direct neighbors into the cluster, the diameter of the resulting networks would be between  <dig> and  <dig>  even if the resulting subnetworks would have the diameter of  <dig>  that diameter is almost one standard deviation below the average diameter of known biological pathways . in contrast, our gdv-based approach produces ppi subnetworks with diameters between  <dig> and  <dig>  with the average of  <dig>  and the standard deviation of  <dig> , thus mimicking well the diameters of known biological pathways.

validation of novel melanogenesis regulatory genes identified by topological clustering analysis
topological clustering identified both sprs and potentially novel pigment regulators that are components of the ednrb network. as ednrb and gna <dig> sirna impact pigment formation in our screen and regulate melanogenesis by well-characterized mechanisms, we next sought to experimentally validate novel ednrb pathway components identified by our method. ednrb, a g-protein coupled receptor mutated in waardenburg-shah syndrome  <cit> , binds to edn <dig>  <cit>  and activates an intracellular signaling cascade via gna <dig>  <cit> . activation of ednrb leads to pkc activation, and subsequent erk phosphorylation. phosphorylated erk can either activate mitf by protein phosphorylation, or up-regulate mitf transcription through creb phosphorylation  <cit> . mitf directly activates the expression of many melanogenesis regulators, such as tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in melanin synthesis  <cit> . in addition to regulating melanogenesis, ednrb plays a critical role in neural crest development  <cit> . as some proteins that interact with ednrb may impact neural crest development as opposed to melanogenesis, we focused on validating proteins in the ednrb network most likely to directly impact melanogenesis. for this analysis, we select half of the sprs most likely to directly regulate melanogenesis  from figure 3: two sprs in the cluster , and four sprs adjacent to the cluster . we then validate known regulators of pigmentation in our experimental system , and examine other proteins in the ednrb network not identified in our fg screen .

to experimentally validate our computational observations, we transfect mnt- <dig> cells with three sirnas directed towards each gene or control sirnas. the ability of each target sirna to inhibit pigment production is compared to tyrosinase sirna to control for the efficacy of sirna transfection and the background absorbance of mnt- <dig> cells  <cit> . in this analysis, we utilize different sirna sequences than those used in the initial fg screen  to further exclude any phenotypes from the initial screen that were the result of rnai off-target effects. we also utilize a more robust cutoff to identify pigment regulators  to identify only those genes with significant impacts on pigment production. sirnas targeting kprs  have impacts on pigment production, consistent with published studies. a majority of analyzed sprs  from ednrb network  have significant impacts on pigment production observed with more than one oligonucleotide sequence, indicating that the phenotypes are not secondary to rnai off-target effects . other proteins from ednrb cluster  have a high retest rate as well  . the one gene that did not impact pigmentation in this analysis  is a regulator of postganglionic synaptic transmission  <cit> , an ednrb neurologic phenotype independent of melanogenesis  <cit> . these results demonstrate that our ednrb network contains newly defined regulators of pigment production .

impact of novel ednrb pathway components on downstream signaling
our rnai validation studies  identified genes in the ednrb network that impact pigment production. based on functional annotation , we next select  <dig> pigment regulators from figure 4a to verify that these genes impact pigment production by impacting ednrb signaling. quantitative rt-pcr was utilized to determine the impact of each sirna on its cognate target. rt-pcr validation studies were performed at two different timepoints to account for the potential differences in half-life of an individual mrna. our validation studies revealed that each sirna inhibited the expression of the target gene at either  <dig> or  <dig> hours after sirna transfection . sirnas directed towards known ednrb pathway components  impact mitf protein levels, consistent with published studies  <cit>  . similarly, novel ednrb pathway components  impact mitf protein levels, suggesting that these genes may have similar impacts on pigment production. activation of the ednrb pathway leads to increased mitf expression through p-creb or leads to activation of mitf protein through phosphorylation  <cit> . in the simplest model, genes that impact mitf phosphorylation will impact tyrosinase expression while genes that impact mitf expression will impact both mitf and tyrosinase expression. therefore, we would predict that sirnas that inhibit mitf phosphorylation would have impacts on tyrosinase expression but not mitf expression, while sirnas that impact creb phosphorylation would inhibit both tyrosinase and mitf expression. to further validate this assertion, we examine the impact of each sirna on the mrna expression of mitf and tyrosinase. ednrb, edn <dig>  and gna <dig> have modest impacts on both mitf and tyrosinase expression, as predicted. most of the other sirnas examined impact on both mitf and tyrosinase expression, with the exception of dpysl <dig> .

gene ontology database is used to assess function and identify conserved domains within the corresponding proteins. z-scores are calculated based on the initial screen data  <cit> .

to determine the role of individual targets in ednrb signaling, we examined whether the  <dig> genes  that impact mitf and tyrosinase mrna expression also impact creb phosphorylation. previous studies have determined that mnt- <dig> melanoma cells contain a braf mutation resulting in constitutive erk activity  <cit> . therefore, we would predict that the majority of ednrb pathway components that impact pigment production in mnt- <dig> cells would do so via impacts on creb phosphorylation, as the erk pathway leading to mitf phosphorylation is constitutively active. treatment of mnt- <dig> cells with ednrb, edn <dig>  and gna <dig> sirnas impacts creb phosphorylation but not erk phosphorylation . similarly, taok <dig>  ptk2b, fhod <dig> and plcd <dig> sirnas inhibit creb phosphorylation . published studies support the notion that these four genes are components of the ednrb signaling network upstream of creb phosphorylation. serine/threonine-protein kinase tao <dig>  activates the p <dig> map kinase pathway through the specific activation of the upstream mkk <dig> kinase  <cit> . this signaling pathway activates p <dig> leading to creb phosphorylation in melanocytes  <cit> . it also is known that protein tyrosine kinase  <dig> beta  activation leads to erk1/ <dig> activation  <cit> . in turn, erk1/ <dig> phosphorylates p90rsk, which phosphorylates creb  <cit> . endothelins promote dendrite formation facilitating melanosome transport from melanocytes to keratinocytes  <cit> , processes that require extensive actin cytoskeletal reorganization  <cit> . formin homology  <dig> domain containing  <dig> , a protein with several potential pkc phosphorylation sites  <cit> , directly binds to f-actin and plays a role in actin cytoskeleton organization  <cit>  and cell elongation  <cit> . additionally, fhod <dig> activates erk inducing changes in gene expression  <cit> . our studies implicate fhod <dig> as a potential player in endothelin mediated actin-cytoskeletal reorganization.

upon endothelins binding to endothelin receptors of melanocytes, phospholipase c is activated  <cit>  and initiates subsequent activation of protein kinase c and erk pathways. phospholipase c delta- <dig>  hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -bisphosphate  to generate two second messengers: diacylglycerol  and inositol  <dig> ,5-trisphosphate   <cit> . dg mediates the activation of protein kinase c , and ip <dig> releases calcium from intracellular stores, which in turns activate erk  <cit> . in melanocytes, plc antagonist u <dig> inhibits endothelin-1-induced intracellular calcium rise and erk phosphorylation  <cit> , providing direct evidence that phospholipase c activity impacts endothelin-induced signaling in primary melanocytes. analysis of gene annotation data reveals that plcd <dig> is a phospholipase c homologue that may function directly downstream of gna <dig> . as plc activity impacts ednrb signaling in melanocytes, we sought to examine whether plcd <dig> was the plc isoform that impacts ednrb signaling in normal melanocytes. depletion of plcd <dig> in normal melanocytes impacts mitf protein levels . additionally, we demonstrate that plcd <dig> sirna inhibits creb phosphorylation in the context of ednrb receptor stimulation, consistent with the hypothesis that plcd <dig> is upstream of the creb phosphorylation event. these results demonstrate that some components in our ednrb network participate in ednrb signaling in normal and cancer cells .

in this study, we apply a ppi network topology-based approach that utilizes gdvs to identify novel components of melanogenesis regulatory pathways. related approaches that detect biological function from ppi network topology rely on simpler network properties such as direct neighbors of nodes and shortest path distances  <cit> . since none of the  <dig> sprs in ednrb cluster are adjacent in the ppi network, but are at distance three or four from each other, they could not have been topologically clustered together by analyzing only their neighbors or distances in the ppi network. additionally, as mentioned above, examining only direct neighbors of an spr is not appropriate for constructing its underlying melanogenesis-related pathway.

although gdv-based computational method has already been used to demonstrate that topologically similar proteins share common biological properties such as protein function or involvement in cancer  <cit> , in this paper, we provide a novel application of the method, namely identifying novel components of biological pathways known to regulate melanogenesis. we use this graph theoretic method to identify proteins with similar topological signatures to known pigment regulators and to construct the corresponding melanogenesis-related subnetworks. most importantly, we experimentally validate that the novel components of these melanogenesis-related subnetworks are components of the ednrb pathway in both pigmented melanoma cells and normal melanocytes.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we utilize a ppi network topology-based computational approach to identify a set of novel ednrb pathway components. using rnai-based approaches, we validate that some of the proteins in ednrb network impact melanogenesis, demonstrating that topological clustering approaches can uncover additional components of known regulatory networks. sprs that cluster with ednrb have similar impacts on mitf protein levels, on mitf and tyrosinase expression, and on creb phosphorylation, indicating that they are likely components of the same biological pathway. validation of plcd <dig>  a potent regulator of mitf in mnt- <dig> cells, reveals that novel ednrb pathway component identified in mnt- <dig> cells impact ednrb signaling in normal melanocytes. our study demonstrates that integration of ppi network topology-based algorithms with functional genomics datasets is a fruitful method to enhance our systems-level understanding of biological phenotypes. in the future this method may be used to place targets identified in rnai screens within the context of known biological pathways that regulate the system under study, deriving additional relevance from systems-level rnai datasets.
