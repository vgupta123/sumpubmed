BACKGROUND
the atmyb <dig> transcription factor is involved in tapetum and pollen development and is required for the regulation of tapetal programmed cell death  in developing arabidopsis anthers  <cit> . using  <dig>  kb of the atmyb <dig> promoter fused to the gus reporter gene and in-situ hybridization analysis, expression of atmyb <dig> was found in the tapetum, middle layers and developing microspores from anther developmental stages  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . functional disruption of atmyb <dig> results in complete male sterility with early tapetum degeneration and collapsed pollen  <cit> . three genes directly regulated by atmyb <dig> have been identified using chip analysis, namely an a <dig> aspartic protease , a pectin methylesterase  and a glyoxal oxidase . premature tapetal pcd and degeneration were observed in the undead and atmyb <dig> mutants  <cit> .

the atmyb <dig> homologs from rice , wheat , barley  and canola  have been isolated and their protein sequences show significant conservation  <cit> . high similarity occurs between the r2r <dig> myb domains, the 44-amino acid region immediately downstream of the myb domain and an 18-amino acid sequence at the c-terminus  <cit> . the expression patterns driven by the osmyb <dig>  tamyb <dig> and bnmyb <dig> promoters in arabidopsis are similar to that of atmyb <dig>  being restricted to the tapetum and developing microspores and occurring from stages  <dig> to  <dig>  when driven by the atmyb <dig> or their native promoters, the full-length osmyb <dig>  tamyb <dig> and bnmyb <dig> constructs are able to fully restore the fertility of the male sterile atmyb <dig> t-dna mutant  <cit> .

the two agriculturally important oilseed brassica species, canola  and brown mustard , originate from hybridisation between pairs of the diploid species b. rapa , b. nigra , and b. oleracea   <cit> . the full-length bnmyb <dig> of the c genome has been isolated  <cit> , while the myb <dig> orthologs from the a genome of b. napus and b. juncea and c genome of b. oleracea have not yet been identified. upland cotton  is the most widely cultivated allotetraploid species and originated from interspecific hybridization between g. arboreum  and g. raimondii   <cit> . only one myb transcription factor, ghmyb <dig>  has so far been found to play a role in cotton anther development  <cit> . ghmyb <dig> is the cotton homolog of atmyb <dig>  two partial coding sequences of ghmyb <dig> were separately obtained and the deduced amino acid sequence shares high similarity with myb <dig> homologs in other species  <cit> . however, the full-length dna sequence of each ghmyb <dig> ortholog is still lacking. the expression pattern of ghmyb <dig> has not been determined and whether functional conservation exists between atmyb <dig> and ghmyb <dig> is unknown.

the utilization of cytoplasmic male sterility  and nuclear encoded fertility restore genes  is an important technology for hybrid cotton and canola production  <cit> . however, the cms-based hybridization system is difficult to develop and maintain  <cit> . furthermore, the cms phenotype is often unstable under both high and low temperatures  <cit> . manipulation of expression of the myb <dig> transcription factor provides a novel means to induce and subsequently reverse male sterility, facilitating the production of hybrid plants  <cit> . the experiments described here were aimed at cloning the myb <dig> genes from cotton and brassica  and comparing their protein structures and promoter sequences. the expression pattern of the ghmyb <dig> gene in cotton anthers and its capacity to rescue the male sterile atmyb <dig> mutant were determined. the role of a conserved  <dig> amino acid sequence in myb <dig> function was further assessed. the effectiveness of ghmyb <dig> and bnmyb <dig> proteins to induce male sterility in arabidopsis was examined, when fused to the ear sequences.

RESULTS
cloning of the homologous myb <dig> genes from brassica and cotton
the homologous myb <dig> genes from b. napus , b. juncea , b. oleracea  and g. hirsutum were cloned and sequenced. the nucleotide sequences and the deduced amino acid sequences were compared with arabidopsis atmyb <dig>  <cit> , b. napus myb <dig>   <cit>  and b. rapa myb <dig>  obtained from the genbank  . the nucleotide sequences of the eight myb <dig> homologs are highly conserved in their exons. the amino acid sequences are highly similar in the myb domain , a 44-amino acid region adjacent to the myb domain , and a  <dig> amino acid region at the end of the c-termini. a variable region of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids is present between the 44-amino acid and the c-terminal sequences, sharing  <dig> % identity . among the five myb <dig> homologs of the brassica species, the amino acid sequences in the variable region of the three a genes are more similar to each other than that of the two c genes . the myb <dig> homolog of the brassica b gene has not yet been cloned. the two myb <dig> ortholog genes  from g. hirsutum are highly conserved, sharing  <dig> % and  <dig> % identity in their nucleotide and peptide sequences, respectively . the two genes are likely to be derived from the a and d genomes.figure  <dig>

deletion and mutagenesis analysis of the atmyb <dig> promoter
to delineate the region of the atmyb <dig> 5’utr/promoter responsible for directing expression to the tapetum and pollen, a series of four atmyb <dig> promoter-gus deletion constructs were prepared. these constructs incorporated  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or 240bp of the atmyb <dig> 5’utr sequence  into the pbi vector and were transformed into the wild-type arabidopsis . the histochemical gus staining of florets from the transgenic lines was compared to that of the ppg construct possessing a 3200bp atmyb <dig> promoter  <cit> . similar gus intensity was present in the young florets with the  <dig> and 1651bp promoters. no gus activity was detected in the 240-pbi transgenic lines. when compared with the 1651-pbi lines, very weak and weak/moderate gus intensity was present in the 256-pbi and 284-pbi lines, respectively .figure  <dig>

the − <dig> to -240bp sequence of the atmyb <dig> promoter possesses two putative cis-elements, namely myb <dig> and myb <dig>  when the myb <dig> element was mutated in a 1105bp promoter , gus expression in the anther was unaffected . however, when myb <dig> and myb <dig> elements were both mutated , gus activity persisted through to stage  <dig>  rather than being downregulated at stage  <dig>  the activity at stage  <dig> was localized in the microspores or degenerating tapetal layer . pollen grains in stage  <dig> anthers also expressed gus activity . both the myb <dig> and myb <dig> elements of the atmyb <dig> promoter are conserved in the c genome of brassica but not in the other four myb <dig> genes. myb <dig> is conserved in the ghmyb <dig> promoter and myb <dig> in the bnmyb <dig> a gene promoter .

to examine whether the expression of atmyb <dig> is auto-regulated, a promoter-gus construct possessing a 1105bp atmyb <dig> promoter was introduced into an atmyb <dig> t-dna insertion mutant . homozygous atmyb <dig> plants are completely male sterile whilst heterozygous plants are fully male fertile  <cit> . gus activity was observed in the anthers of the heterozygous atmyb <dig> mutant from stages  <dig> to  <dig>  the same as previously described  <cit> . gus expression was extended to stage  <dig> in the two homozygous atmyb <dig> mutant lines . gus activity was present in the largely vacuolated tapetal layer  and collapsing pollen grains  .

transcript levels of atmyb <dig> in both wild-type and atmyb <dig> mutant were analysed using real-time qrt-pcr. the level of truncated atmyb <dig> transcript was approximately  <dig>  fold higher in the young mutant floral buds  than that of the wild-type . previous microarray data comparing differential gene expression in the wild-type and atmyb <dig> mutant anthers showed a  <dig>  fold  up-regulation of the truncated atmyb <dig> transcript in the mutant   <cit> . these results together suggest atmyb <dig> is involved in the negative auto-regulation.

the promoters of all eight myb <dig> genes possess a highly conserved sequence approximately − <dig> to -380bp upstream of the atg codon. four cis-elements are conserved in all six genes, including w-box , myb , gtgantg <dig>  and dofcorezm elements  .

gus expression driven by the ghmyb <dig> promoter in arabidopsis
to ascertain whether the ghmyb <dig> promoter resembles the atmyb <dig> promoter in driving expression in the arabidopsis anther, the gus reporter gene was used. the ghmyb80- <dig> promoter employed was  <dig> bp in length . an anther line up showed gus activity first appeared at stage  <dig> and persisted to stage  <dig> . no activity was detected at stages  <dig> and  <dig>  light and dark field microscopy of anther sections showed gus activity in the tapetum and microspores at stages  <dig> and  <dig> . hence, the expression pattern driven by the ghmyb80- <dig> promoter in arabidopsis resembles that of the atmyb <dig> promoter.figure  <dig>

transcript levels of ghmyb <dig> in developing cotton anthers
the indicative sizes  of cotton floral buds corresponding to anther developmental stages were determined using semi-thin sections . the anther stages  were numbered in accordance with the morphological changes used for defining the stages of arabidopsis anther development  <cit> . at stage  <dig>  formation of the tapetum in cotton anthers was initiated . at stage  <dig>  the tapetal layer became vacuolated . the tapetal cytoplasm was condensed at stage  <dig>  and cell walls degraded at stage  <dig> . tapetal cell degeneration appeared to commence at stage  <dig>  and tapetal layer was no longer visible at stage  <dig> . the transcript levels of ghmyb <dig> in cotton anthers at the developmental stages  <dig> to  <dig> were analysed using real-time qpcr  and rt-pcr . the ghmyb <dig> transcript level was very low at early stage  <dig>  subsequently increasing at stages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the major increase was from stage  <dig> to  <dig> when the tapetal cytoplasm becomes condensed and tetrads appear. at late stage  <dig>  ghmyb <dig> transcripts could no longer be detected.figure  <dig>

ghmyb <dig> can rescue the male sterile arabidopsis atmyb <dig> t-dna mutant
to determine whether the ghmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> are functionally conserved, the atmyb <dig> mutant was transformed with the full-length ghmyb80- <dig> coding sequence under the control of its own promoter  or the atmyb <dig> promoter  . the homozygous atmyb <dig> t-dna insertion mutants possessing the transgenes were identified using pcr. plant fertility is defined as the percentage of the elongated siliques versus the total siliques. in one of the ten pgh80:gh <dig> transformed atmyb <dig> homozygous mutants, fertility was partially restored  . the other nine lines were less than 10% fertile or remained completely sterile. however, fertility of the nine atmyb <dig> homozygous lines carrying the pat80:gh <dig> transgene was significantly or fully restored, resulting in 50-100% fertility . the expression levels of the pgh80:gh <dig> and pat80:gh <dig> genes in the relevant transgenic lines were determined using real-time quantitative pcr. plant fertility was positively correlated with the relative expression levels of the transgenes . the ghmyb80- <dig> promoter is apparently not as effective as the atmyb <dig> promoter in arabidopsis.figure  <dig>

the effects of removing the 44-amino acid or the c-terminal region on myb <dig> activity
to examine the functions of the 44-amino acid region and the c-terminus of myb <dig> protein, two truncation constructs were created by either removing the 44-amino acid region  or the variable region and c-terminus  from the protein . the at80mp-lv construct was introduced into the atmyb <dig> mutant and the at80md construct transformed into wild type arabidopsis. silique elongation and pollen viability were examined in the transgenic lines. all twelve atmyb <dig> homozygous lines transformed with the at80mp-lv transgene failed to elongate siliques  . hence, the 44-amino acid domain is essential for myb <dig> activity and may be required for the binding of the r2r <dig> myb domain to cis-elements in the promoter of target genes. a wide variation in fertility  was found in the at80mp-lv transgenic atmyb <dig> heterozygous lines . qrt-pcr examined expression of the at80mp-lv transgene in two atmyb <dig> homozygous and four heterozygous lines. severe male sterility  was observed in line  <dig> where a high level of the at80mp-lv expression was detected . in the heterozygous lines, the at80mp-lv protein may be competing for proteins that bind to the c-terminus of endogenous atmyb <dig> and are required for myb <dig> activity.figure  <dig>

four out of the twenty-four wild type lines transformed with at80md exhibited 15-50% fertility . the remaining lines remained partially  or fully fertile. the transcript levels of at80md were all significantly higher than that of the endogenous atmyb <dig> in all the selected lines . the highest expression level of at80md was obtained in line  <dig>  which showed 15% fertility. the transcript levels of the endogenous atmyb <dig> were reduced in all the lines when compared with the wild-type level. tapetum and pollen development in the partially sterile at80md lines was examined using light microscopy of anther sections. at stage  <dig>  the tapetum cells were vacuolated and the microspores released from the tetrad were enlarged  and irregularly shaped . the tapetum cells became highly vacuolated and hypertrophic at stage  <dig>  microspore degradation had commenced and cellular debris was observed in anther locules . at stage  <dig>  a few pollen grains have developed normally in one anther locule and the tapetal layer is degenerating . in a second locule, however, microspores and tapetum remained highly vacuolated and hypertrophic. microspore debris was present and tapetal cell walls were intact. the cytoplasmic content of tapetal cells was greatly reduced. the tapetum had completely degenerated at stage  <dig>  pollen grains had collapsed and debris was attached to the endothecium layer . the at80md truncation protein may be able to compete with the endogenous atmyb <dig> for binding the promoters of target genes, but fail to activate gene expression.figure  <dig>

male sterility in arabidopsis is induced by ghmyb80/bnmyb80-ear fusion repressors
manipulation of atmyb <dig> function has been employed to develop a reversible male sterility system in arabidopsis. a chimeric construct of the full-length atmyb <dig> with the srdx ear motif resulted in 60% of the transgenic lines exhibiting complete male sterility  <cit> . an ear-like motif , designated 32r, is a putative negative regulatory domain  found in atmyb <dig> and shared by other myb proteins in subgroup  <dig>  <cit> . we wished to determine if the ghmyb <dig> and bnmyb <dig> proteins are effective in inducing male sterility in arabidopsis when the 32r motif is fused. in addition, to determine whether the effect is enhanced by truncating the myb <dig> protein, adding two rather than one 32r motif or by increasing promoter strength. a full-length or a truncated ghmyb <dig> was fused in frame with two copies of the 32r sequence . the truncated sequence consisted of the myb domain and the 44-amino acid region. both chimeric constructs were driven by the 443bp ghmyb80- <dig> promoter . the full-length bnmyb <dig>  coding sequence was also fused with one or two copies of the 32r ear and placed under the control of a 700bp bnmyb <dig> promoter . the effect of double promoters was examined by using double  <dig> or 700bp bnmyb <dig> 5’utr sequences to drive the bnmyb80-32r <dig> chimeric constructs  .figure  <dig>

pcr screening identified forty-one transgenic pgh80:gh80-32r <dig> and sixty-three transgenic pgh80:gh80md-32r <dig> lines. silique elongation in each line was examined. approximately one-third of the transgenic pgh80:gh80-32r <dig> lines and half of the pgh80:gh80md-32r <dig> lines showed less than 25% fertility . a partially fertile phenotype  was observed in 34% of the transgenic pgh80:gh80-32r <dig> lines and 3% of the transgenic pgh80:gh80md-32r <dig> lines, respectively . alexander’s staining of anthers from the severely sterile  lines possessing either construct showed the majority of pollen grains lacked cytoplasmic content . the expression levels of the pgh80:gh80-32r <dig> and pgh80:gh80md-32r <dig> transgenes as well as the endogenous atmyb <dig> were examined in the selected lines using qrt-pcr. plant fertility was shown to depend on the ratio between the transcript levels of the transgenes and endogenous atmyb <dig>  the higher the ratio , the lower the plant fertility obtained . the addition of two 32r copies to the  <dig> bp bnmyb <dig> promoter driving bnmyb <dig>  was less effective than a single ear sequence  . two copies of the  <dig> bp bnmyb <dig> promoter driving the full-length bnmyb <dig> gene  were more effective than the two copies of the  <dig> bp bnmyb <dig> promoter . the bnmyb80-32r repressor induces male sterility more strongly in arabidopsis than ghmyb80-32r when the two chimeric constructs were driven by their own promoters. the difference may reflect the shorter length  of the ghmyb <dig> promoter.table  <dig>

discussion
comparison of myb <dig> structure and function
among the proteins encoded by the eight myb genes cloned from arabidopsis, brassica and cotton, the myb domain, an adjacent  <dig> amino acid sequence and an  <dig> amino acid c-terminal sequence are highly conserved. the latter is extended by eight amino acids in the two cotton proteins. a variable region of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids is located between the 44-amino acid and the c-terminal sequences, sharing  <dig> % identity between the eight myb proteins.

the sequence conservation among myb <dig> proteins suggests similar functions. osmyb <dig>  tamyb <dig>  bnmyb <dig>   <cit>  and ghmyb80- <dig> are all able to restore male fertility of the atmyb <dig> mutant, implying functional conservation between monocots and dicots. the conserved  <dig> amino acid sequence is essential for myb <dig> function as, when removed, the protein is unable to restore atmyb <dig> fertility.

ghmyb <dig> in cotton anther development
the developmental stages of cotton anther development were found to closely resemble those of arabidopsis . in arabidopsis atmyb <dig> expression is strongest at stage  <dig> and tapetal cell degradation is initiated at stage  <dig>  <cit> . in cotton, however, tapetal cell degradation commences at anther development stage  <dig> and is largely completed at stage  <dig>  these differences are consistent with the earlier increase  and downregulation  of myb <dig> transcript levels in cotton.

comparison of the myb <dig> promoters
the promoters of all eight myb genes share an  <dig> bp sequence  which includes four cis-elements, one of which is a myb binding site. we have not yet ascertained the importance of these elements in driving gene expression. ghmyb <dig> was more effective in restoring male fertility of the atmyb <dig> mutant when driven by the atmyb <dig>  than the ghmyb <dig> promoter , presumably reflecting the difference in promoter length. this result implies that additional cis-elements driving expression are located in the − <dig> to − <dig> region. alternatively, the timing of ghmyb <dig> promoter expression, which is perhaps slightly different from that of the atmyb <dig> promoter, may also reduce the effectiveness of ghmyb <dig> promoter in complementing the atmyb <dig> mutant. the reduced autoregulation caused by the ineffective cis-elements in ghmyb <dig> promoter may contribute to the timing difference.

two putative myb-binding sites, namely myb <dig> and myb <dig>  are situated -257bp and -246bp upstream of the transcription start site of the atmyb <dig> promoter. gus expression appeared unaffected driven by the myb <dig> mutated promoter. however, when both myb elements were mutated, gus expression no longer ceased at anther stage  <dig> in arabidopsis, persisting into stage  <dig> in microspores and degraded tapetal cells. although it is not clear yet whether a mutated myb <dig> element alone would affect the atmyb <dig> expression, these results suggest myb <dig> element plays a major role in the down-regulation of myb <dig> expression at the later stages. the two myb cis-elements in the atmyb <dig> promoter are conserved in the promoter of the b. napas myb <dig> c gene and the two ghmyb <dig> genes. however, they are absent from the wheat and rice myb <dig> gene promoters, suggesting myb <dig> downregulation may be regulated differently in monocots.

disruption of the atmyb <dig> gene also changes the expression pattern of its promoter. thus the gus expression driven by the wild-type atmyb <dig> promoter was extended to stage  <dig> in the anthers of the homozygous atmyb <dig> mutant. the expression levels of the truncated atmyb <dig> transcript were up-regulated in young atmyb <dig> anthers as shown in the microarray and qrt-pcr analyses. these results suggest that atmyb <dig> protein is involved in the negative auto-regulation of its expression at the later stages of anther development. atmyb <dig> positively regulates the expression of some genes but represses the expression of others  <cit> . the mechanism by which myb <dig> changes from an activator to a repressor is not known. three other myb proteins, atmyb <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> possess an ear-like sequence, and have been shown to repress their own promoters  <cit> .

atmyb <dig> positively regulates the expression of the aspartic protease encoding gene undead. a gene that must be downregulated if the correct timing of tapetal pcd is to be achieved  <cit> . thus it is critical that myb <dig> expression is repressed at the appropriate stage of anther development. the downregulation of ghmyb <dig> at late stage  <dig> in cotton anthers is consistent with the earlier tapetal degradation when compared with arabidopsis.

myb80-ear as an inducer of male sterility
the chimeric protein atmyb80-ear when introduced into arabidopsis induces male sterility  <cit> . the ghmyb <dig> and bnmyb <dig> proteins fused with an ear-like sequence, namely 32r, also resulted in male sterility in arabidopsis. since the sterility can be reversed  <cit>  and myb <dig> proteins from cotton, canola, wheat and rice have similar functions, the system provides a novel means to obtain hybrid vigour in crops. important is the level of myb80-ear expression that can be achieved to ensure maximal levels of male sterility.

the transcript level of endogenous atmyb <dig> is reduced in all lines over-expressing at80md. the overexpressed truncated protein may compete for the atmyb80-interacting proteins, leading to the reduced expression of the endogenous atmyb <dig> gene. whilst rnai silencing of the endogenous atmyb <dig> in at80md lines could not be excluded as responsible for the reduction in male fertility, the silencing does not appear to significantly affect the expression of the transgene at80md.

when the 32r sequence was fused with the truncated ghmyb80md sequence and transformed into wild type arabidopsis plants, the percentage of male sterile plants obtained was higher than when the full length ghmyb <dig> sequence was used. fifty percent of the pgh80:gh80md-32r <dig> lines were more than 75% infertile while the figure was 30% for the full length pgh80:gh80-32r <dig> lines. the at80-ear  construct resulted in 60% of arabidopsis lines isolated exhibiting complete male sterility and silique abortion  <cit>  whereas with at80md-ear  the figure rose to 75%  <cit> .

a strong promoter is required to drive the myb80-ear construct to maximize the level of male sterility obtained. the 700bp bnmyb <dig> promoter was more effective than the 400bp promoter, although two copies of the 700bp bnmyb <dig> promoter were no better than a single copy. a single ear sequence fused to the myb <dig> protein was more effective than a double sequence. the pbn700x2:bn80-32r <dig>  construct resulted in approximately 60% of lines being completely male sterile. however, a similar percentage of lines displaying complete male sterility was obtained when bn80-32r  was driven by a single copy of the bnmyb <dig> promoter .

the results indicate that a combination of a strong promoter  and a single copy of the ear sequence fused to the myb80md protein will induce high levels of complete male sterility. in addition, the 32r ear is less effective than the srdx when fused to the myb <dig> protein. this variability suggests the possibility of designing new ear sequences with even greater repressive activity.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we extend our studies on myb <dig> genes to include the brassica a and c genomes and the two cotton orthologs. promoter and functional analysis of the orthologs found that the expression pattern and function of a cotton ortholog are conserved and that myb <dig> expression is negatively autoregulated. the developmental stages of the cotton anther were examined and ghmyb <dig> expression found to cease prior to the commencement of tapetal degradation.

the conservation of myb <dig> genes in crops is of interest as manipulation of the gene’s expression provides a novel reversible male sterility system for obtaining hybrid vigour. we examined ways to optimize inhibition of atmyb <dig> expression using a chimeric myb <dig> fused with the ear sequence from atmyb <dig>  a single ear copy fused to the truncated myb <dig> driven by a strong promoter  proved to be the most efficient construct for obtaining male sterility.
