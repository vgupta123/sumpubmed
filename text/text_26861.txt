BACKGROUND
adeno-associated viruses  hold great promise in human gene therapy and have been widely used to target liver, muscle, heart, brain, eye, kidney and other tissues in various studies due to its ability to provide long-term gene expression and lack of pathogenicity . aavs belong to the parvovirus family and each contains a single strand dna flanked by two inverted terminal repeats  <cit> . there have been reported at least  <dig> capsid serotypes of aav vectors  and their unique capsid structures enable them to recognize and transduce different cell types and organs. for instance, aav2-mediated rpe <dig> gene transfer conferred safe and efficient improvement in retinal function in leber’s congenital amaurosis patients by subretinal injection  <cit> . aav8-mediated hfix gene transfer by a single peripheral-vein infusion consistently leads to long-term expression of the fix transgene at therapeutic levels without acute or long-lasting toxicity in patients with severe hemophilia b  <cit> .

aav vector possesses many advantages in gene transfer, but there are still some problems to be solved. aav infection steps include receptor binding, cell entry, intracellular trafficking, uncoating, second-strand synthesis, vector genome stabilization and so on  <cit> . the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation machinery has been considered to be a major barrier that negatively affects aav-mediated gene expression by degrading the viral particles during their intracellular trafficking  <cit> . point mutation of surface exposed tyrosine residues of aav capsid protein was reported as a simple and effective method for evading phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination, leading to higher transduction efficiency both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . there have also been reported that point mutations on the aav capsid at specific tyrosine, serine, threonine and lysine residues could lead to significant transduction improvement both in vitro and in vivo .

aav-dj is a variant generated from the libraries of aav hybrids of eight serotypes by dna shuffling method  <cit> . it is able to efficiently transduce a broad range of cell types in vitro but has specific liver tropism in vivo, like aav <dig>  moreover, it possesses more ability to evade immune neutralization and thus can efficiently deliver higher quantities of therapeutic dna  <cit> . recently, aav-dj has been widely used for gene therapy due to its high efficiency in gene transfer. for example, aav-dj vector was used to deliver a knockout construct to fetal pig fibroblasts with a higher targeting frequency than the other naturally occurring serotypes  <cit> . aav-dj mediated homologous recombination  at high efficiency in human keratinocytes and had been used to correct the lama <dig> locus in primary cells, which was not transduced efficiently by the most commonly used aav serotypes  <cit> .

to further improve the aav-dj vector, our study focused on investigating whether point mutations on the capsid of aav-dj can increase its transduction efficiency or broaden the tropism both in vitro and in vivo. aav <dig> and aav <dig> are the closest parental vectors of aav-dj and most of the amino acid residues are similar between the capsids of these three vectors. it has been reported that single point mutation on the t <dig>  t <dig> site of aav <dig> or the k <dig> site of aav <dig> capsid leads to dramatic enhancement of gene delivery  <cit> . in the aav-dj capsid, lysine  and threonine  residues are retained at the  <dig> and  <dig> positions as they are in the capsid of aav <dig> or aav <dig>  the single point mutation at the t <dig> residue, which is equivalent to the t <dig> residue in the aav-dj capsid, has been reported to significantly enhance aav2-mediated gene delivery  <cit> . by using the online phosphorylation and ubiquitination sites prediction tools, we found out that the k <dig> or t <dig> residue but t <dig> residue might be an ubiquitination or phosphorylation site, while the residue s <dig>  which is close to the t <dig> residue and equivalent to the s <dig> phosphorylation site of aav <dig>  might be an effective phosphorylation site of aav-dj. thus, we hypothesize that mutation of these predicted sites k <dig>  t <dig> and s <dig> in aav-dj may cause similar enhancements. in this study, the single point mutants of k137r/t251a/s503a at aav-dj capsid were generated respectively and further their differences for in vitro and in vivo transduction efficiency and tropism were evaluated.

aav-dj mutants led to significant improvement for gene delivery in adult c57bl/ <dig> mice after intravenous injection
to study whether the mutants we constructed can lead to differential gene expression in vivo, we used a dual-luciferase reporter system: gaussia luciferase  and firefly luciferase . the gaussia luciferase is secretory, providing an all-over gene expressing analysis at different time points during the experiment, while the firefly luciferase is nonsecretory, allowing visualization of localized gene expression via in vivo bioluminescence. in this study, each animal received 1 × 1011vg vectors by intravenous injection. first we collected venous blood via the tail at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 42 days after vector injection and evaluated the relative light unit  emitted by the gaussia luciferase using a luminometer. as shown in fig. 2a, the rlu in each animal reached a peak at day  <dig> and maintained a level of  <dig>  ~  <dig> , <dig> rlu. by two-way anova analysis, the s503a mutant displayed significant enhancement of 2- to 3-fold at each time point , and the t251a mutant showed ~ <dig> -fold enhancement at day  <dig> and  <dig> , while the k137r mutant showed no significant enhancement. to study the in vivo tropism of these vectors, animals were imaged after the last blood collection and the in vivo bioluminescence were analyzed. as shown in fig. 2b, all vectors exhibited liver tropism. for further evaluation, we compared the viral genome copy numbers in different tissue samples at 42 days after vector injection by using real-time pcr . the results showed that the k137r, s503a and t251a mutants led to significant enhancement in transduction in liver samples with  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> -fold higher dna copy numbers respectively, compared to aav-dj. the s503a mutant resulted in 2- to 3- fold higher copy numbers in tibialis anterior  and heart tissues while k137r showed  <dig> -fold higher copy numbers in kidney tissue. no significant differences were observed in brain, lung and pancreas. to our surprise, the three mutants showed a significant decrease of 2 ~  <dig> fold in dna copy number than aav-dj in spleen tissue.fig.  <dig> aav-dj and its three single point mutant vectors mediated dual-luciferase expression levels in c57bl/ <dig> mice. 1 × 1011vg of aav vectors encoding dual-luciferase were delivered into 6– <dig> weeks old c57bl/ <dig> male mice via tail vein injection. gaussia luciferase expression levels were detected at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 42 days after vector injection. the values used are relative light unit  emitted by the gaussia luciferase from each animal. levels of significance were determined using two-way analysis of variance. the data are shown as mean values ± sem . for in vivo bioluminescence analysis, images were taken from the ventral aspect after last blood collection and the average expression rang was 100– <dig> photon/s

discussion
many efforts have been made to improve the efficacy of aav-mediated gene transfer in vitro and in vivo . among these, point mutation in the viral capsid protein seems to be the most simple and universal method. aav transduction efficiency could be dramatically increased by mutations of particular capsid residues, which allowed the vectors to evade the intracellular phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation . point mutation of specific tyrosine, serine, threonine or lysine was reported to significantly increase serotype  <dig> and  <dig> aav-mediated gene transfer both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . aav-dj, which can efficiently transduce a broad range of cell types in vitro, but has specific liver tropism in vivo, is a chimera of eight aav serotypes and shares >85 % sequence identity to the parental strains  <cit> . thus, we hypothesized that point mutant of specific tyrosine, serine, threonine or lysine in aav-dj can further increase its transduction efficiency or change its tropism both in vitro and in vivo. based on the fact that single point mutation on the t <dig>  t <dig> residues of aav <dig> or the k <dig> residue of aav <dig> capsids can lead to significant gene expression enhancement  <cit> , and through online phosphorylation and ubiquitination sites prediction, the k <dig>  t <dig> and s <dig> residues of aav-dj capsid may be effective ubiquitination or phosphorylation sites, so we decided to generate the following three mutants of aav-dj: k137r, t251a and s503a.

as shown in results, these three mutants of aav-dj showed slight enhancement of gfp gene expression in 293 t, hela and hepg <dig> cells. there may be several factors that contributed to the in vitro results. as demonstrated by aslanidi et al., a multiple mutant of aav <dig> led to ~24-fold higher efficiency in in vitro gene transduction, which was mainly because the combined mutants had better ability for escaping ubiquitination then resulting in more nuclear translocation and more transgene expression  <cit> . in our study, we found no significant difference in in vitro gene delivery between aav-dj and its mutants, it might because aav-dj is a hybrid vector and already has better ability to evade from phosphorylation and ubiquitination  <cit> . thus, single point mutations of aav-dj may not impact viral entry and cytoplasm/nuclear transgene distribution and is insufficient for enhancing gene delivery in vitro. it remains to be further investigated if multiple mutants of aav-dj could lead to enhancement in in vitro gene delivery. aside from these mutations, aav-dj is a hybrid vector with receptor binding regions and major phosphorylation sites on the aav capsid that may be different from its parental serotypes, thus the same residue mutant may lead to different effects  <cit> . moreover, aav-dj display superior infectivity in many cell lines than aav <dig>  which was thought to be the best ex vivo gene delivery aav vector, so there may be no significant potential for aav-dj mediated up-regulation of gene expression in vitro  <cit> . however, significant enhancements in systemic gene expression level or liver tropism were observed in vivo when the vectors containing the luciferase reporters were injected into mice via tail vein. two mutants we constructed showed significant enhancement in transduction efficiency in liver, especially for the s503a which exhibited rapid gene expression and maintained higher gene expression level at all the time points investigated. since the s <dig> residue of aav-dj was equivalent to the s <dig> residue of aav <dig>  which turn out to be an effective phosphorylation site of aav <dig>  it remains to be further studied if the s501a mutant of aav <dig> could lead to significant enhancement in aav2-mediated gene delivery. we would not expect a huge increase for gene expression just as the same mutants of aav <dig> did, since aav-dj is a hybrid vector and had been strictly selected with human antisera, and has the best ability to avoid phosphorylation in vivo  <cit> .

recently, some conflicting results were reported on the same residue mutants of different aav serotypes. for example, the y to f mutants of aav <dig> can dramatically enhance gene transfer and expression both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . however, qiao and co-workers found negative effects when y to f mutants were applied to aav <dig> and aav <dig>  <cit> . our study on y to f mutants of both aav <dig> and aav-dj also displayed minimal enhancement of gene expression in vivo . furthermore, qiao et al. also obtained negative results of k137r on aav <dig>  <cit> , which were reported to enhance gene expression by  <dig> to  <dig> fold in liver  <cit> . these inconsistent results may be caused by using different reporters contributing to various measurements of transduction efficiency, incorrect vector titers, dilutions, and/or inconsistent vector potency from batch to batch.

in summary, the aav-dj capsid mutants  generated in this study led to significant improvements in systemic transgene expression and exhibited liver tropism after tail vein injection in mice. thus, the enhanced aav vectors have great potential for future gene therapy applications.

CONCLUSIONS
we successfully constructed three mutants based on phosphorylation or ubiquitination sites on the aav-dj capsid. our results show that the point mutants s503a/t251a can lead to improvement in gene delivery and minimal change in tissue tropism. these enhanced aav vectors have great potential for future gene therapy applications.
