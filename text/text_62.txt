BACKGROUND
nowadays, more and more attentions are paid on food safety and nutrition, and providing non-contaminated and fiber-rich food is becoming an important public issue. accordingly, developing improved and new methods to produce whole wheat bread and reduce the use of chemical additives are challenges for the baking industry  <cit> . traditional chemical food additives have been used in the baking industry to enlarge loaf volume, lengthen shelf life, and improve the taste of breads, etc. however, some of these compounds may threaten the health of consumers. for example, potassium bromate, the most widely used food additive, is now known to be a human carcinogen and has been banned by most of countries  <cit> . azodicarbonamide, a bleaching and improving agent, is only a permitted food additive in certain countries. it partially degrades under the heat process to form trace amounts of semicarbazide, which shows carcinogenicity and has been proved to cause tumors  <cit> . therefore, it is very urgent to find safe food additives to replace the previous harmful chemical additives. recombinant enzymes, as safe substituents, were firstly applied in baking industry in the 1970s due to the ever-increasing demand for more natural products. in the past  <dig> years, many enzymes, including α-amylase, cellulase, hemicellulase, and xylanase, have been successfully applied in the baking industry  <cit> .

xylanase is used as baking additives to improve processing and product quality. it affects enhancements in dough and bread quality leading to improved dough flexibility, machinability and stability as well as a larger loaf volume and an improved crumb structure. however, xylanase has not been applied extensively in baking industry because of high cost and poor effects, especially in the developing country. to reduce the price of enzymes, it is highly desirable to adopt gene engineering to produce enzymes with better performance. thus, hundreds of xylanase genes from bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes have been cloned and expressed heterolougously  <cit> .

now, many xylanases have been used to efficiently express in the yeast host, especially in pichia pastoris within the past teens years. however, p. pastoris cannot be used in the food industry since it does not have gras status by the fda  and requires large methanol supplement during the fermentation in most conditions. contrarily, kluyveromyces lactis, as another yeast expression host, has a gras status by fda, which permits its use in food and feed applications. meanwhile, compared with other yeast expression systems, k. lactis has advantages of multicopy gene integration, easy genetic manipulation, the availability of a fully sequenced genome  <cit> , and it can easily grow to a high density on inexpensive lactose-based media  <cit> . therefore, k. lactis has been used to efficiently express many proteins in the past few years, and the best example for its use is commercial production of the milk clotting enzyme, bovine chymosin  <cit> . thus, several researchers tried to express different xylanase in this system. xynas from the extreme thermophile thermotoga sp. strain fjss3b. <dig>  <cit> , and the dictyoglomus thermophilum strain rt46b. <dig>  <cit> , respectively, and xyn11a from bacillus halodurans strain c- <dig>  <cit>  were expressed in k. lactis using episomal vector. however, they would have the risk of instability due to lacking of selective pressure. only xynb from the t. maritima msb <dig> was expressed stable in k. lactis based on the integration vector  <cit> . however, these xylanases were not investigated about application in baking industry. additionally, thermophilic and halophilic xylanases are not favorable in the dough baking since high temperature and salt are not necessary.

xylanase gene xynzg was cloned from p. cucumerina and had been successfully expressed in p. pastoris in our previous report  <cit> . recombinant xylanase xynzg has high specific activity and the optimal ph and temperature of  <dig> and 40°c, respectively  <cit> . these features may indicate that xynzg has the potential use in baking. thus, we try to express xylanase gene xynzg in k. lactis and study the effect of recombinant xynzg on dough and bread in bread-making. additionally, xylo-oligosaccharides  of the hydrolytic products were recently reported to possess a remarkable potential for stimulating the growth of intestinal bifidobacteria and promoting the intestinal health  <cit> . because of this reason, we investigated the hydrolytic products of xynzg in this study.

RESULTS
construction of plasmid pklac2-xynzg and expression in k. lactis
a  <dig> bp dna fragment corresponding to xynzg was cloned into the pklac <dig> vector, fusing with the mf-alpha leader sequence for secretory expression in k. lactis gg <dig>  the recombinant plasmid was named as pklac2-xynzg . for bio-safety and integration consideration, the ampicillin resistance gene on recombinant plasmid pklac2-xynzg was removed by sacii digestion before transformation, so that the engineering strain producing xylanase does not contain any known antibiotic resistance genes. this is of vital importance for food enzymes  <cit> . the linearized plasmid was transformed into k. lactis and the transformants were cultured on the ypd plates containing 1% rbb xylan . one transformant with the largest halo gkx <dig> was chosen for shake-flask fermentation. the supernatant of the fermentation was performed on a 12% sds-page gel and the resolved proteins were visualized by staining with coomassie brilliant blue. a band of proximately  <dig> kda was observed, which accorded with the deduced molecular weight of xynzg from p. pastoris. in addition, to detect the activity in situ and identify the target protein, the zymogram analysis was performed and the result revealed that there was only one about  <dig> kda active band detected by amido black staining , consistent with our previous report  <cit> .figure  <dig>

the recombinants gkx <dig> were inoculated into ypl, ylp, ylu and ylpu medium, respectively, and underwent further shaken flask fermentation for  <dig> h. the activities and biomass were all measured during  <dig> h  and the results indicated the activity of xynzg reached highest level at  <dig> h with  <dig> u/ml in ylpu. in order to illustrate the relationship between the activities and the biomass, figure 4b showed the biomass and enzyme activities in different media. no obvious biomass difference existed in the four media whereas the enzyme activity differed significantly. thus, the medium ylpu was the optimal medium for xynzg expression in k. lactis.figure  <dig>

mass spectrometry analysis of xylan hydrolysate
the hydrolyzate was analyzed using electrospray ion source mass spectrometry in the positive ion reflective mode. as shown in figure  <dig>  there were two m/z peaks of  <dig> , and  <dig> , which corresponded to xylobiose  and xylotriose , respectively. therefore, the results showed that xylobiose and xylotriose were the main hydrolysis products released from beechwood xylan by xynzg and the yield of xylobiose was greater than that of xylotriose.figure  <dig>

effects of xynzg on the bread making
xynzg has a broad working temperature range, which has an apparent optimal temperature of 40°c and retains approximately 75% and 55% of its maximum activity at 35°c and 25°c, respectively  <cit> . the mesophilic property of xynzg makes it exhibit different characteristics from other fungi family <dig> xylanase, thus it may be highly suited for use in the baking industry as it is generally optimally active at the room temperatures most frequently used for dough preparation and proofing  <cit> .

bread quality assessment by sensory properties is largely based on personal judgment and subjective qualitative evaluation, whereas the results cannot be absolute but reflect the influences of consumer preferences  <cit> . the effects of xynzg at different concentration on the attributes of dough or bread were shown in table  <dig>  compared to the control lacking of xylanase, the dough handling time reduced from  <dig>  min to  <dig>  min and the height-diameter ratio of dough increased with the increasing concentration of xynzg. meanwhile, the addition of xylanase remarkably modified organoleptic properties of fresh whole wheat bread, so that the total sensory properties score reached  <dig> when  <dig> ppm of  <dig> u xynzg was supplemented, while the control only got a score of  <dig>  however, the dough handling properties became a little sticky when the concentration of xynzg reached  <dig> ppm which was not suitable for manufacturing conditions which required the dough to be more 'machine-friendly' to avoid sticking to machinery parts. the result was consistent with the previous report that extra addition of the xylanase was not necessary in the baking process  <cit> . thus, the proper concentration of xynzg was  <dig> ppm.table  <dig>

the experiment was performed by one step fermentation. water, yeast, sodium chloride, modifier and oil bread were mixed according to the fixed ratio, except for xynzg. the dough was proofed at 38°c for  <dig> min, and baked at 225°c for  <dig> min. static , image analysis, sensory analysis and color measurements  were used for bread quality evaluation.



in order to avoid the personal sensory difference, the volume and texture of bread were also evaluated by the volume measuring device and the texture analyzer, respectively. as shown in figure  <dig>  the addition of xynzg to the baking dough led to the increase of volume compared to the negative control lacking xylanase. at the optimal dosage of  <dig> ppm, xynzg increased the specific volume of  <dig> %. the effects of xynzg on the bread texture profile were also shown in table  <dig>  with the increase of xynzg, the initial crumb hardness and chewiness were both improved. the hardness was increased by  <dig> % at the dosage of  <dig> ppm, while chewiness changed slightly. in addition, xynzg did not have a significant effect on bread springiness.figure  <dig>

discussion
enzymatic baking serves as a good alternative to improve bread quality and strengthen food safety. therefore, developing a cost-efficient bio-baking process of bread by enzyme represents a major future trend of baking industry. many bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes can produce xylanase while the yield is not very high to apply in industry. the low-cost of xylanase will be a key issue for accelerating bio-baking application in the dough treatment process. so it is important to get the cost efficient and high specific activity xylanase with an improved expression level in an ideal host. to reduce the price of enzymes, finding new xylanase gene and heterologous expression are highly desirable to produce enzymes with better performance. in our previous study, a xylanase gene xynzg was cloned from p. cucumerina and heterologously expressed in p. pastoris with high specific activity of  <dig> u/ml  <cit> . recombinant xylanase xynzg has optimal ph and temperature of  <dig> and 40°c, respectively  <cit> . in spite of the high yield and simple purification process, p. pastoris is not permitted for use in the food industry because it is not a gras and requires methanol supplement during its fermentation in most condition. compared to p. pastoris, k. lactis as a heterologous expression host, which has been used to efficiently express many proteins in the past few years, and has a gras status that permits their use in food and feed applications. thus, in this study, we successfully expressed the xylanase gene xynzg in k. lactis despite of expression yield in k. lactis was lower than that in p. pastoris.

so far, several researchers expressed four different xylanase in this system. however, the activity of xynzg in this study can reach  <dig> u/ml based on the integration vector, which is much higher than  <dig> u/ml of xynb from the hyperthermophilic bacterium thermotoga maritima msb <dig>  which was uniquely expressed stable in k. lactis based on the integration vector  <cit> . the other three xylanase expression in k. lactis based on episomal vector would have the risk of instability without selective pressure in spite that their activity are a little lower than xynzg,  <dig> u/ml of xyna from the extreme thermophile thermotoga sp. strain fjss3b  <cit> ,  <dig> u/ml of xyna from d. thermophilum rt46b. <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig> u/ml of xyn11a from b. halodurans strain c- <dig>  <cit> . additionally, neither of them was investigated or mentioned about application in baking industry. their features are not suitable for baking use, either. what’s more, the expression yield of recombinant xynzg can be further improved through engineered strain containing high copy numbers of the xynzg, and optimized fermentation condition, making bread-baking application possible.

in addition,xylanase was used to produce xylo-oligosaccharides  in recent years. owing to the special properties of xos, they possess a remarkable potential for practical utilization in many fields, including pharmaceuticals, feed formulations and agricultural applications  <cit> . among these xos, xylobiose and xylotriose  are considered to be the main xylooligosaccharides for food applications since xylobiose and xylotriose can stimulate the growth of intestinal bifidobacteria. the vitro assays showed that both xylobiose and xylotriose can be utilized by bifidobacterium spp. and b. adolescentis  <cit> . contrarily, some harmful microorganisms, such as staphylococcus, e. coli and many clostridium spp. cannot utilize xylobiose and xylotriose  <cit> . moreover, the sweetness of xylobiose is equivalent to 40% of sucrose while it does not cause increase of blood sugar  <cit> . in this study, the main products of hydrolytes produced by xynzg are xylobiose and a small part of xylotriose. the results of baking trial also indicate that addition of xynzg can increase the bread volume and improve the crumb structure, which is similar to the enzymes in gh <dig>  a previously used industrial xylanase family. therefore, addition of xynzg can not only increase the bread volume and the crumb structure, but also improve the flavor and the health value of bread.

CONCLUSIONS
in general, the xylanase gene xynzg can be stably and highly expressed in k. lactis as a functional enzyme, and xynzg can efficiently increase bread volume and improve the flavor and function of bread. in this study, the xylanase gene xynzg of p. cucumerina was first successfully expressed in k. lactis and the expression activity was the highest activity reported so far. this is also the first report of using k. lactis expressed xylanase used in baking industry and the baking experiments showed that addition of this enzyme can efficiently improve the volume and sensory properties of bread.
