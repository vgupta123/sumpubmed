BACKGROUND
previous studies have shown that breast tumors can be divided into five subgroups  based on their mrna expression patterns  <cit> . these patterns have been validated in independent datasets representing different laboratories, platforms and different patient cohorts  <cit> . survival analyses on a sub-cohort of patients with locally advanced breast cancer showed a significant difference in outcome of the patients in the various expression subgroups, with poor prognosis for the erbb2+ and basal-like subtypes  <cit> . the expression of  <dig> genes, the intrinsic gene list, has been suggested to be sufficient to separate breast carcinomas into the five distinct subgroups. what mechanisms of common regulation make these genes cluster together? we have previously shown that we can separate the patient clusters based only on the promoter composition of single binding sites in the promoters of the genes from the intrinsic gene list  <cit> . however, regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes is highly complex and depends on sets of tfs rather than individual tfs  <cit>  and in this study we attempt to characterize the overrepresentation of entire tf families. the promoter composition of the genes is one of the major determinants of gene regulation including multiple transcription binding sites that interact with a specific combination of transcription factors . eukaryotes achieve this diversity by combining a small number of transcription factors whose activities are modulated by diverse sets of conditions  <cit> . different functionalities can be conferred on one tf by its association with different co-factors. these factors may act as global tfs that assist their gene-specific partners in their function, and may thus activate or repress transcription depending on the partner motif and the condition  <cit> . analyzing transcription network dynamics in yeast, luscombe et al. showed that, in response to diverse stimuli, transcription factors may alter their interaction patterns to varying degree, thereby rewiring the network  <cit> . while few transcription factors serve as permanent hubs, most of them act transiently during certain conditions. exogenous processes like environmental responses facilitated fast signal transductions to multiple genes with short regulatory cascades, whereas endogenous processes needed to progress through multiple stages with a complex combination of tfs to fewer target genes  <cit> . the same tfs may act both in endogenous and exogenous processes. regulatory hubs targeting disproportionately large numbers of genes and thereby representing the most influential components of a network- have been described. both pilpel  <cit>  and luscombe  <cit>  concluded that precise regulation of a condition cannot arise from the specificity of individual tfs, therefore combinatorial tf usage seems to be the key. the nf-κb family of tfs is an example of transcription regulators that are activated by both intra- and extra-cellular stimuli such as cytokines, oxidant-free radicals, ultraviolet irradiation, and bacterial or viral products  <cit> . aberrant nf-κb activity has been implicated in carcinogenesis and in the control of cellular response to anti-cancer agents. activated nf-κb was detected predominantly in er-negative breast tumors, and mostly in the erbb2over-expressing tumor subgroup  <cit> .

methods
the in silico analysis of the transcriptional regulation of genes defining the subgroups was performed at three different levels:  study of the pathways in which the genes distinguishing the subgroups of breast cancer may be jointly involved including upstream regulators  as well as downstream targets of these genes.  then we analyzed the promoter areas of these genes  for canonical transcription binding sites using genomatix.  we looked for the actual expression levels of the identified tf and how they correlate with the overrepresentation of their tf binding sites in the separate groups.

selection of genes
the expression of  <dig> genes, the intrinsic gene list, which has been suggested to be sufficient to separate breast carcinomas into the five distinct subgroups defined in  <cit>  and  <cit>  was used for the pathway analysis in this study . a subset consisting of  <dig> genes  <cit>  that best represented the classification scheme in breast cancer  were selected from the intrinsic list, and used in the promoter analysis part .

pathway analysis
pathway analysis was performed using pathway studio  <cit>  from ariadne genetics. two network prediction algorithms were used that allow to discover the patterns of gene expression inherent in the experimental data: pearson correlation and auto net finder network prediction algorithm. pathway studio’s text mining tools were applied to extract biological associations by mining pubmed to build pathways from extracted facts using data from recent publications and public and commercial databases such as kegg, bind, go, and the pathart database of curated signaling and disease pathways. the algorithm for building correlation network in pathway studio is based on pearson correlation. genes with similar expression profiles are connected with edges indicating the significance of the correlation. the group of tightly correlated genes form cluster in the correlation network. the algorithm can be used for clustering genes according to their expression profiles across multiple samples. the tool calculates correlation coefficients between all pairs of gene expression profiles measured in the experiment and outputs clusters of highly correlated genes. identified gene clusters can be further validated and analyzed using relations from the database that have been extracted from the literature by ariadne genetics. auto net finder is a network estimation system that combines hierarchical clustering and graphical gaussian modeling and is used for distinguishing direct and indirect relationship among variables. bibliosphere pathways   <cit>   was used for extracting the associations between gene, transcription factor and proteins corresponding with the genesets defining each molecular subtype of breast cancer. genomatix bibliosphere is a knowledge database consisting of manually curated co-cited genes in pubmed, which additionally provides information about the presence of tfbs in their promoters, using in silico tool- matinspector, interactions and associated pathways from molecular interactions database-netpro and biocyc, respectively.

analysis of overrepresentation of tfbs families in the promoter sequences
we extracted the putative regulatory promoter regions from 500 bp upstream to 100 bp downstream of refseq promoters of the subtype-associated genes. further analysis was based on the hypothesis that overrepresentation of potential transcription factor binding site  motifs in a set of co-expressed gene promoters may indicate regulatory relationship. in order to emphasize the functional representation of tfbs motifs overrepresented in a set of promoters, we used the tfbs matrix family concept. tfbs matrix families are defined as groups of tfbs weight matrices corresponding to the same or functionally similar transcription factors. for any given tf, there could be multiple matrices described by different independent sources, leading to multiple matches for similar position or shifting of matches by a few base pairs. by using the functional domain clustering based on di/tri/tetra-nucleotide occurrence and additionally function-based subgrouping, tfbs matrices can be grouped according to their functional similarity, known as tfbs families  <cit> . thus members sharing same tfbs family are expected to have functional similarity in addition to binding domain similarity. for estimation of over-representation of each tfbs family, first occurrences of its corresponding tfbs motifs within a set of subtype-specific promoter sequences was obtained. then relative occurrence of each tfbs family was estimated by comparing this observed occurrence to the rate of occurrence of the same tfbs matrix family in an equal base-pair long reference background sequences from human promoter. overrepresentations of a motif is measured by two different methods:

 <dig>  in terms of fold factor of overrepresentation compared to the backgroundfold factor of tfbs overrepresentation was calculated by a formula as mentioned below:

  r=nobsnexp where, r = fold factor of overrepresentation of a tfbs family, xnobs  = observed number of hits of x in a given set of promoter sequencesnexp  = expected number of hits of x in an equally sized sample from genomic promoter background sequences

 <dig>  as z-scores that provide a measure of the distance of sample from the reference population mean. here sample refers to the number of observed hits of any particular tfbs in a given input set of sequences and reference refers to the number of hits of the same tfbs in equally sized human genomic promoter sequence population.

  z=nobs−nexp− <dig> s 

z is a z-score of overrepresentation of a transcription factor binding site family ;

nobs  is a number of observed hits of x in an input promoter sequences;

nexp  is expected number of hits of x in an equally sized sample sequences in human genomic promoter background;

s is a population standard deviation of number of hits of x

we used genomatix regionminer tool  in order to evaluate the degree of tfbs family overrepresentation. the histogram of z-scores of each tfbs motif families in each subtype-specific promoter sequences is shown in the additional file 2: figure s <dig>  histograms like this indicate that choosing the cut-off level of  <dig>  allows identifying tfbs families that are overrepresented. however, z-score cut-off level of  <dig>  does not provide a precise measure of significance, because of the disparity of sample size between sample and reference. due to the copyright and technical limitations in accessing the transfac database, further statistical testing of over-representation could not be performed within that tool.

under-representations or absence of tfbs family motifs in sub-type specific genes may occur due to a fewer number of subtype-representative genes and subsequently a smaller number of promoter sequences used for any particular subtype. this can be a source of false positivity. therefore we have not taken into account the under-representations of tfbs family motifs in this analysis.

principal component analysis to identify tfbs with maximum variance between subtypes
principal component analysis   <cit>  was performed for ranking the tfbs families with respect to the variance of fold-factor overrepresentation contributed by them between five subtypes. we prepared a matrix of tfbs fold-factors for subtypes, with subtypes as columns and tfbs families as rows. we performed pca on this matrix using the princomp function of matlab. subtracting each data point from the column mean represents a center of this matrix. hotelling’s t <dig> statistic was used as a measure of multivariate distance of each tfbs family from the center of the tfbs fold-factor matrix as described in http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/stats/princomp.html.

gene expression data
we used a subset of the samples  from previously published  <cit>  mrna expression data . subtypes were predicted by using the pam <dig> <cit> .

mrna expression of the studied tf
transcription factor families with overrepresentation z-score > <dig>  were mapped to their corresponding probes in the mrna expressions dataset. by applying multiclass sam, we extracted  <dig> tf genes with significantly different  expression between the five subtypes. pearson’s correlation between the subtype-specific geometric mean expression of this subset of transcription factor genes and fold overrepresentation was computed. the justification of using geometric mean instead of arithmetic mean is that typically mrna expression values are log-normally distributed.

RESULTS
pathway analysis of the genes that define the five breast cancer subgroups
using pathway studio from ariadne genetics, we studied the direct interactions between the genes with distinguished gene expression pattern in the breast cancer subgroups as described in materials and methods, selection of genes. most profound direct interactions were observed for the genes defining the luminal a group with protein-protein interactions between xbp <dig> and esr <dig> and ccnd <dig> . trefoil  has been functionally coupled to ccnd <dig> through angiotensin receptor  <dig> . angiotensin ii is converted from its precursor by angiotensin i-converting enzyme  and has been shown to mediate growth in breast cancer cell lines via ligand-induced activity through the angiotensin ii type  <dig> receptor . we also searched for upstream regulators as well as downstream targets of these genes. downstream targets could be observed centered at the esr <dig>  myc, nfkb <dig>  gata <dig>  ccnd <dig>  tp <dig> and msx2/foxc <dig> .

a somewhat less organized pathway structure is observed in the luminal b subclass. the esr <dig> node was not observable and the tp <dig> network was more sparse with fewer partner genes. novel nodes were centered at nrg <dig>  gstp <dig> and cul <dig> , cul <dig> has homology to yeast cdc <dig>  which is part of a complex known as scf that mediates the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of g <dig> cycles and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, while nrg <dig> contains a domain related to the epidermal growth factor family of ligands and can act as receptor agonists. the direct interactions between genes highly expressed in luminal b subtype were observed between gstp <dig> and cdk2ap <dig>  s100a <dig> and s100a <dig> and ppp1r13b and tp53bp <dig>  the latter protein interacts with tp <dig> to specifically enhance p53-induced apoptosis but not cell cycle arrest.

four distinct regulatory nodes were observed in the erbb <dig> group: around the erbb <dig> itself, tp <dig>  nfkb <dig> and ctnnb <dig>  . nfkb-p <dig> was shown to repress β-catenin-activated transcription of cyclin d <dig>  <cit> . moreover, a direct interaction is established between erbb <dig> and grb <dig> . the solution structure of the grb7-sh2/erbb <dig> peptide complex was described and suggested to be involved in cell signaling pathways that promote the formation of metastases and inflammatory responses. pparbp, which is co-amplified with erbb <dig>  has in early studies been suggested to play a role in mammary epithelial differentiation and in breast carcinogenesis by its ability to function as esr <dig> coactivator. it was shown to contain a typical ccat box and multiple cis-elements such as c/ebpbeta, yy <dig>  c-ets- <dig>  ap <dig>  ap <dig>  and nfkappab binding sites. the  <dig> different regulatory nodes are connected by flot <dig>  the human epidermal surface antigen involved in epidermal cell adhesion. nfkb <dig> was present in the network for the basal group, where also the fox family, a whole family of cyclins and cdk <dig>  and cdk <dig> and isoforms of protein kinase  were present . interestingly, a large number of connections lead to gja <dig> . other distinct nodes around tp <dig> are those connecting to krt <dig>  mapk signalling, e2f <dig> and ncl. ncl, nucleolin, one of the most abundant nucleolar proteins, has been recently shown to be involved in the reprogramming of somatic cells for derivation of either embryonic stem  cells, by somatic cell nuclear transfer , or es-like cells, by induced pluripotent stem  cell procedure. nucleolar proteins are proposed to be the markers of activation of embryonic genes  <cit>  and provide mechanism for nucleolar control of progression of cell cycle in stem cells and cancer cells  <cit> . tp <dig> was a central node in the regulatory network of the normal-like subgroup, surrounded by jun, acss <dig>  acsl <dig>  krt <dig>  pik3r <dig> and other nodes some representing glycolysis, energy metabolism, pyruvate metabolism and metabolism of carbohydrate .

noteworthy, a tp <dig> network node was observed in each of the studied expression subclasses shown here . it is of interest to note that in every case tp <dig> was a hub in a somewhat different neighborhood. while in the basal subtype tp <dig> was connected to cdk <dig>  a cyclin-dependent protein kinase  that regulate major cell cycle transitions and cdh <dig>  cadherin  <dig>  as well as fzd <dig> and krt <dig>  in the luminal a tumors one could observe detoxifying enzymes such as nat <dig>  cyp2a <dig> as well as the retinoic acid receptor rarres <dig> in the tp <dig> hub .

over-representation of specific transcription factor binding sites in the promoter of the genes that distinguish the subtypes
the correlation matrix of tfbs fold-overrepresentation vectors for the five subtypes shows positive correlation in terms of potential tfbs family overrepresentation between  <dig>  erbb2+ and basal subtypes ;  <dig>  luminal b and erbb2+ ;  <dig>  luminal a and luminal b . in order to visualize the differential tfbs overrepresentation, we performed the principal component analysis . pca plot  displays the significant differences between the subtypes in terms of fold-factor of motif frequencies observed in promoter sequences of subtype-associated gene promoters compared to their corresponding normal frequencies in genomic promoter sequences. distances between points representing the tfbs matrix families are the multivariate distances of fold-factor overrepresentation of each tfbs family in each of the subtype. this indicates that the shorter the distance, the greater similarity in fold-overrepresentation of that particular tfbs family in given subtypes. more than 60% and 76% of cumulative variance is captured by first two components and first three principal components, respectively. the top ten ranking tfbs families in distance from center and some of the functionally significant tfbs families are specifically labeled in the pca plot. biplots of first and second principal components show differentially overrepresentated tfbs families between the normal-like and rest of the subtypes. biplot of second and third principal components shows tfbs family overrepresentations in luminal b. differential tfbs family representations between erbb2+ and basal groups cannot be seen in biplots of first three principal components, but can be visualized in a biplot of first and fourth principal components. in the first principal component, v$btbf, v$pax <dig>  v$pax <dig> and v$tcff are the major contributors of variance, where as v$pax <dig>  v$guce, v$arid are the major contributors of variance in the second principal component.

several of the gene clusters shared cis-elements that were present in more than 90% of the promoters. for the top six genes that classify the erbb2+ over-expressing cluster, four tfbss were found to be present in 100% of the promoters. these were nolf , etsf , stat  and nf-κb  . nf-κb is the family of nuclear factor kappa beta of transcription factors. nf-κb has been shown to promote cell proliferation, to suppress apoptosis, to promote cell migration, and suppress differentiation  <cit> . nf-κb binding sites were found significantly over-represented in the promoters that best classify the erbb2+ subgroup compared to the other  <dig> subgroups  and 78% of the  <dig> genes expressed in the basal-like subgroup had also nf-κb binding site in the promoter. this was in marked contrast compared to the promoter composition of the normal-like and luminal subgroups . the presence of nf-κb binding sites in the genes from the erbb <dig> and basal groups is in concordance with the pathway analysis performed on the downstream genes . the cis-elements pax <dig>  pax <dig> , mazf  and egrf  were overrepresented in the genes that are over-expressed in the luminal b subgroup . while the pax superfamily is involved in a multitude of developmental processes and is required for initiating b cell lineage and maintaining neural development and spermatogenesis, the mazf is a common transcription factor and might play a more general role. the major distinction between the luminal a and b, both consisting of er positive tumors, is the presence of a strong proliferations cluster in the luminal b subtype. noteworthy, binding sites for growth factors and their receptors like egrf are over-represented in the promoters of the genes that define the luminal b subgroup and were overrepresented in the pathway analysis as well . egrf is not only a receptor for egf , but also for other members of the egf family and it is involved in the control of cell growth and differentiation. for the geneset of the normal-like subgroup, we observed overrepresentation of nrf <dig> family of tfbs .

presence of promoter modules in genes that define the erbb2+ subgroup
the specificity of promoter-controlled gene regulation may depend on the relative organization of the elements within the promoter rather than solely on individual elements  <cit> . genes expressed in the same functional context do often share promoter modules  <cit> . the binding elements are often occupied differently in different tissues, and these differences can be used to derive all type-specific sub-modules in silico. a promoter module may be defined as an organized group of regulatory elements where both order and distance should be considered. genes expressed in the same functional context do often share promoter modules  <cit> . for the six best genes of the erbb2+ over-expressing cluster, a common framework consisting of nf-κb and ets <dig> transcription factor binding sites was found . the ets are fundamentally important tfs with roles in cell development, cell differentiation, cell proliferation, apoptosis and tissue remodeling . the family is characterized by an evolutionarily conserved dna-binding domain that regulates expression by binding to a purine-rich core sequence in cooperation with other tfs. most of the proteins in the ets family are downstream nuclear targets of ras-map kinase signaling, and the deregulation of ets genes results in the malignant transformation of cells  <cit>  it has previously been reported that mutant tp <dig> required ets <dig> to synergistically activate the expression of abcb <dig>  ets <dig> was shown to interact exclusively with mutant tp <dig> in vivo, but not with wild-type tp <dig>  <cit> . high levels of ets <dig> expression were associated with poorer prognosis  <cit> . the presence of a promoter module constituting of nf-κb and ets has been reported previously in genes co-regulated in mitogen-stimulated t-cells  <cit> . interactions between members of the ets family and nf-κb have been described previously. ets <dig> induces ikkα expression. ikkα is a kinase that marks the nf-κb inhibitor iκb for degradation, and active nf-κb is translocated to the nucleus. ets1-mediated activation of ikkα is negatively regulated by tp <dig> binding to ets <dig>  tp <dig> physically interacts with ets <dig> and specifically inhibits ets <dig> induced ikkα promoter activity. loss of tp53-mediated control over ets <dig> dependent transactivation of ikkα may represent a novel pathway for the constitutive activation of nf-κb mediated gene expression and therapy resistance in cancer cells  <cit>  tp <dig> is therefore an ets <dig> and ets <dig> target gene  <cit> . nf-κb controls a broad spectrum of genes by a variety of mechanisms in response to diverse environmental changes. nf-κb may be a universal regulator, while ets could reflect cell-type or stimulation specific differences since ets binding sites were detected in a fraction of the nf-κb controlled genes.

over-representation of tp <dig> mutations in the tumors that belong to the erbb2+ and basal-like subgroups
in human breast tumors, the two tumor subgroups exhibiting the most prominent activation of putative nf-κb target genes  also harbored the highest frequency of p <dig> mutations. 86% of the patients in the erbb2+ subgroup had tp <dig> mutations in their tumors and all the genes that are abnormally expressed in this tumor type have nf-κb binding sites in their promoter . there is an evidence that nf-κb can regulate tp <dig> expression and that nf-κb is required for tp53-dependent cell death  <cit> . in turn, tp <dig> activates nf-κb through the raf/mek1/p <dig> pathway  <cit> . the tp <dig> protein interacts with nf-κb and enhances its transcriptional activity and its anti-apoptotic efficacy. over-expression of erbb <dig> is known to induce the classical nf-κb pathway  <cit> . the estrogen receptor  can bind physically to nf-κb to inhibit its dna binding functions, hitherto repressing gene expression  <cit> . therefore the nf-κb pathway was shown to be a major stroma-tumor signaling mediator in er negative tumors with over-expression of erbb <dig>  <cit> . nf-κb signaling has been associated with doxorubicin resistance, and agents blocking nf-κb function have been proven beneficial in the treatment of tumors in combination with standard anti-cancer therapies  <cit> .

over-represented transcription factor families within the promoter sequences
we observed the over-representation of v$btbf , v$oazf and v$pax <dig> in basal and erbb2+ tumor associated gene promoters . kaiso group of transcription factors are known to show nuclear accumulation during active mitosis  <cit>  and their over-representation indicates potential functional role in these two subtypes showing aggressive tumor progression and high cell proliferation. pax <dig> activity has also been observed in metastatic renal tumors  <cit> . precise role of pax <dig> and oazf groups of transcription factors is yet unknown in breast cancers. erbb2+ gene promoters also show over-representation of v$nfkb, pleomorphic adenoma gene associated v$plag and ras-responsive element binding protein associated v$rreb families of tfbs. activity of nfkappa b is already discussed in the earlier section. rreb <dig> activity plays a role in tp <dig> mediated apoptosis  <cit>  that gets perturbed in absence of functional tp <dig>  which is a common phenomenon in erbb2+ tumors. both luminal groups involve over-representation of pax subgroup  <dig> member tfbs’s- v$pax <dig>  v$pax <dig> and v$zf5f families. pax <dig> activity is known to be a marker of better prognosis. overrepresentation of v$p53f, v$hoxf, v$clox, v$parf and v$gata was observed specifically in luminal a group in which estrogen receptor signaling is a predominant characteristic. the transcription factors corresponding to v$parf group  are mediators in oxidative stress-induced apoptosis  <cit> . in the luminal b group of promoters, we observed over-representation of v$egrf, v$ctcf and v$eklf etc. egr- <dig> which corresponds to the v$egrf family is known to be associated with cell cycle entry in response to growth stimuli  <cit> . we also observed significant over-representation of v$nrf <dig> in both normal-like and luminal b group of promoters. nrf- <dig> transcription factor is an oxidant-sensitive transcription factor, usually found in er positive breast cancers  <cit>  and is shown to be associated with higher tumor grade  <cit> .

by using the wilcoxon rank sum test, we observed significantly elevated mrna expressions of esr <dig> and pgr in luminal a or luminal samples compared to the basal ones , with non-significant differences in erbb <dig> expressions. as expected erbb <dig> was significantly upregulated in erbb2+ tumors along with downregulated esr <dig> and pgr, compared to the rest . regulation by many transcription factors shown overrepresented here in er + ve or er-ve subtypes is not well characterized in context of estrogen and progesterone receptor activity. however, overrepresentation of some of the tfbs, such as gata, btbf, nf kappa b – appear to be consistent with prevailing knowledge about the subtypes and their er/pr or her <dig> status.

thus functions of the tf genes corresponding to the over-represented tfbs families hint the predominant characteristics of the subtypes. findings from the above in silico analysis will be further validated in reporter studies and chip analyses. the approach of identifying overrepresented tfbs in a set of coordinately expressed genes under a particular disease class or condition can improve the specificity and noise tolerance.  <cit> . however, its main limitation is that it does not account for the role of local chromatin environment constituted by structural properties, epigenetic modification etc. the local chromatin environment can offer condition-specific functionality to the existing tfbss in a set of promoters. 

promoter sequences extending from 500 bp upstream to 100 bp downstream relative to tss typically contain core promoter elements, cpg islands, downstream promoter element and other components of transcriptional machinery. besides, this region has been demonstrated to have high density of positional as well as comparative tfbs  <cit> , many of which are typically location sensitive. thus limiting the analysis to this proximal promoter region, rather than analyzing the broader region  – could reduce false positives in tfbs overrepresentation. however, by that very limitation we may omit important information about second alternative promoters and distant control loci, which are therefore outside the scope of this analysis.

correlation between actual abundance of tfs and frequency of their bs in the genes defining the clusters
some of the tfbs family overrepresentations were positively correlated with the geometric means of subtype-specific mrna expressions of their corresponding tf genes. . the rationale underlying the use of geometric mean is that gene expression intensity values follow lognormal distribution.

biological uncertainty in a correlation between the abundance of tfs and frequency of their bs might be attributed to several factors. the most common and obvious reason could be mutant or copy number altered tf. moreover, here we have not accounted for the expressions of downstream targets of the tfs. it is noteworthy that mutations  in tfs can also have an impact on the level of expression of the downstream genes. for instance, a mutant tp <dig>  which is still highly expressed, may not recognize the original binding sites anymore, leading to a drop in the expression of the target genes.

CONCLUSIONS
here we report that the promoter composition of the genes that strongly predict the patient subgroups is distinct. the gene classes showed a clear separation when based solely on their promoter composition. this finding suggests that studying those transcription factors associated to the observed expression pattern in breast cancers may lead us to important biological pathways responsible for the regulation of gene expression in breast cancer.
