BACKGROUND
saccharomyces cerevisiae remains the preferred microbe for producing ethanol from pretreated lignocellulose, given its general robustness, high ethanol production rates and ethanol tolerance  <cit> . critical interventions required to enhance the efficiency of this yeast for commercial 2nd generation ethanol production include  introducing capability to ferment xylose  <cit>  and  enhancing tolerance to toxic by-products from steam pretreatment  <cit> .

two approaches can be followed for introducing xylose utilising capability in s. cerevisiae, namely the cloning of xylose reductase  and xylitol dehydrogenase  or cloning xylose isomerase , usually in conjunction with xylulokinase  to convert xylulose to xylulose-5-phosphate. these rational metabolic engineering approaches were exemplified in the respective benchmark studies of wahlbom et al.  <cit>  and kuyper et al.  <cit> . other examples where rational approaches were followed for improved xylose metabolism include studies by gorsich et al.  <cit>  and toivari et al.  <cit> . enhancing yeast tolerance, or “hardening” requires a more comprehensive intervention employing rational approaches to genome modification, random mutagenesis and directed evolutionary engineering under selective pressure . it should be noted, however, that these techniques can also be employed to enhance xylose utilisation in the absence of hydrolysate inhibitors , which suggests technique overlap in achieving both improved xylose utilisation and inhibitor tolerance. furthermore, rational approaches are often challenging due to the complexity of the yeast genome, requiring an in-depth understanding of the metabolome and its response to dynamic inputs, making the investigator reliant on a variety of “–omics” technologies  <cit> . rational approaches were also occasionally found insufficient to instil required capabilities in the yeast phenotype  <cit> . as such, random mutagenesis and selection followed by evolutionary engineering is often the methodological sequence of choice, where the former could lead to phenotypes with enhanced capabilities for either xylose utilisation or inhibitor tolerance but without prior knowledge of specific metabolic pathways. the latter allows for selection under process-relevant conditions  <cit> , especially where inhibitors from lignocellulosic pretreatment are present.

in the literature, strain development predominantly focused on the xr/xdh/xk system where strains with the tmb prefix, produced by swedish researchers, featured quite prominently. s. cerevisiae tmb <dig> produced by wahlbom et al.  <cit>  was later subjected to evolutionary engineering using furfural in sequential batch culture  <cit> , and in another study to sequential batch and continuous culture at a dilution rate  of  <dig>  h- <dig> using spruce hydrolysate, subsequent to uv mutagenesis  <cit> . similarly, s. cerevisiae strain tmb <dig>  <cit>  also harbouring xr/xdh/xk was subjected to evolutionary engineering in continuous culture  in the absence of inhibitors to enhance xylose fermentation  <cit> , as well as in continuous culture  in the presence of hydrolysate  <cit> . other strains of s. cerevisiae were also subjected to either mutagenesis  <cit>  or evolutionary engineering  <cit>  or both  <cit>  , with a few instances where other yeast species were also investigated for enhanced xylose utilisation, including scheffersomyces  stipitis <cit>  and pachysolen tannophilus <cit> . amartey and jeffries  <cit>  described enhanced tolerance by a pichia strain after sequential subculture in different concentrations of corn cob hydrolysate, after overliming with ca <dig> and in an innovative approach, almario et al.  <cit>  used visualising evolution in real-time  to assess molecular mechanisms associated with short term adaptation  <cit>  in batch culture.

noteworthy studies pertaining to strain development harbouring the xylose isomerase  only appeared after the successful expression of xi from piromyces in s. cerevisiae <cit>  followed by evolutionary engineering in oxygen-limited chemostat culture at d =  <dig>  h- <dig> for  <dig> 000 hours in the absence of hydrolysate. similar work was published by wisselink et al.  <cit>  and zhou et al.  <cit>  using sequential batch and continuous culture. in these studies, cassettes containing several enzymes from the pentose phosphate pathway and for arabinose utilisation were transformed into s. cerevisiae. however, in none of these studies were hydrolysates used as additional selective pressure criterion for evolutionary engineering of the xylose fermenting yeast in continuous culture. in fact, to the knowledge of the authors, there appeared only one study where close to the full range of strain development techniques was applied to an xi-containing strain  <cit> . using s. cerevisiae ethanol red as platform, the by now classical approach commenced with rational metabolic engineering through transformation with a cassette containing the xi gene from clostridium phytofermentans, followed by random mutagenesis using ems with hydrolysate and xylose as selective criteria. gene shuffling preceded evolutionary engineering carried out in sequential batch culture without hydrolysate but at very high concentrations of xylose . using a mating approach in a follow-up study  <cit> , this strain designated gs <dig> - <dig> was mated with another tolerant yeast strain after screening  <dig> yeast strains using dilute acid-pretreated spruce hydrolysate. three resulting strains, designated as gsf <dig>  gsf <dig> and gse <dig> revealed a marked improved phenotype compared to ethanol red, producing up to 23%  more ethanol.

the purpose of the present study was to improve the inhibitor tolerance and simultaneously enhance xylose fermentation to ethanol of a recombinant xylose-utilising s. cerevisiae strain d5a+ harbouring the xyla gene from bacteriodes thetaiotaomicron producing xi. “hardening” was accomplished through a combination of random mutagenesis with ems and long-term evolutionary engineering in chemostat culture using xylose as carbon source and liquor from steam-pretreated triticale straw as selective criteria at both steps . the degree of hardening achieved was evaluated through comparison of the fermentative performance of the hardened yeast to the original parental strain, during exposure to pretreatment liquor supplemented with either glucose or xylose in batch culture. two additional non-recombinant s. cerevisiae strains mel <dig> and mh <dig>  as well as s. cerevisiae strain tmb <dig>  were included for comparison. finally, the fermentative performance of the hardened yeast under ssf conditions was assessed using pressed steam-pretreated sweet sorghum bagasse as substrate.

RESULTS
chemical characterisation of steam pretreated triticale straw and sweet sorghum bagasse
the chemical composition of the liquor from steam-pretreated triticale straw  and sweet sorghum bagasse  are shown in table  <dig>  the transition between the two feedstocks was required due to limited material availability. xylose was the most abundant sugar in both the triticale and sorghum pretreatment liquor fractions. this result supported the general observation that predominantly hemicellulose is solubilised during steam pretreatment  <cit>  although it should be noted that no acidic catalyst was used during pretreatment in the present study. after steam pretreatment the wis fractions were first subjected to complete acid hydrolysis before chemical analysis. glucose was the predominant sugar in the hydrolysed sweet sorghum wis fraction, which was expected since the wis fraction of the pretreated material was enriched for both lignin and cellulose, as previously documented  <cit> . acetic acid was the most abundant by-product from steam-pretreatment, followed by furfural and hmf, in both the triticale and sweet sorghum pretreatment liquor fractions. although the acetic acid concentration was significantly greater  in the sorghum pretreatment liquor, the sugar degradation products furfural and hmf were  <dig>  and  <dig>  times more concentrated in the triticale pretreatment liquor. phenolic compounds and their respective degradation products were not quantified in this study. given that hmf, furfural and acetic acid are the main by-products responsible for inhibition of microbial metabolism  <cit> , specific emphasis was placed on the concentration of these by-products as an indicator of pretreatment liquor toxicity.

conditions of steam pretreatment for triticale straw and sweet sorghum bagasse were 200°c for 20 min and 180°c for 5 min, respectively. the chemical composition of the water insoluble solid fraction was determined after washing and subsequent to acid hydrolysis. the composition of pretreated triticale straw wis was excluded from the table since this fraction was not utilised in this study. standard deviations from duplicate analyses are also shown.

random mutagenesis
yeast cells that survived chemical mutagenesis after exposure to  <dig> and 3 μl ems/ml for 1 h were pooled and the growth compared to that of the parental d5a+ strain in a chemically-defined medium supplemented with diluted  and undiluted triticale pretreatment liquor with 20 g/l xylose as carbon source . xylose in combination with the pretreatment liquor was essential for selecting mutants displaying functional xylose utilisation together with increased inhibitor tolerance. as evident from figure  <dig>  mutants of strain d5a+ reached substantially greater total cell counts  than the parental d5a+ strain in the diluted liquor, whereas the undiluted liquor resulted in decreased cell counts, possibly resulting from cell lysis due to the harshness of the medium. the dark medium colour precluded the use of turbidity to quantify culture growth, necessitating the use of serial dilutions and plate counts. based on this data, a triticale hydrolysate concentration of 67%  was regarded as the maximum sub-lethal concentration to which the yeast could be exposed.

evolutionary engineering using continuous culture
mutated cells were subjected to evolutionary engineering using continuous culture at an initial dilution rate of  <dig>  h- <dig> for one week . this low initial dilution rate would allow adaptation of cells to a relatively high pretreatment liquor concentration of 50%  while maintaining selective pressure, albeit at pretreatment liquor levels lower than the maximum sub-lethal concentration. plate counts were used to confirm that the culture did not wash out of the reactor, upon which the dilution rate was incrementally adjusted over a further one week period to a dilution rate of  <dig>  h- <dig>  this dilution rate was maintained at a hydrolysate concentration of 50%  for  <dig> generations , after which the hydrolysate concentration was increased to 60%  for a further  <dig> generations . substantial washout of the culture occurred at dilution rates greater than  <dig>  h- <dig>  which approximated the μmax value of  <dig>  h- <dig>  recorded in batch culture . although attempts were made to attain steady state at a dilution rate close to  <dig>  h- <dig>  the proximity of this dilution rate to the critical dilution rate resulted in large variation in cell counts over a two week period at a hydrolysate concentration of 60% . the absence of total wash-out could possibly be attributed to substantial wall growth after continuous growth for several weeks. due to constraints in pretreatment liquor availability, no further increases in the concentration above 60%  were attempted. the structure of the population was not characterised, where a single colony was isolated after two rounds of subculture on ypx agar  and used for subsequent work. this strategy was based on the premise that after  <dig> generations  under stringent selective conditions , the culture would be predominantly comprised of strains with improved performance and hence, a greater probability of isolating a more resistant strain. as the results showed, this was indeed the case. developing an appropriate screening procedure of isolates with beneficial phenotypes is an ongoing activity in our group.

analysis of strain performance in semi-aerobic batch culture
the strain isolated from continuous culture after  <dig> generations was designated as strain d5a+h and was grown in batch culture on either xylose or glucose to assess its ability to utilise these carbon sources in the presence of pretreatment liquor. culture growth was also compared to three other strains of s. cerevisiae namely strains mel <dig>  <cit> , mh <dig>  <cit>  and tmb <dig>  <cit> , also supplemented with liquor from steam-pretreated triticale. strain d5a+  was included as control on both carbon sources in the presence of liquor. as additional control, the parental d5a+ strain was also grown in the defined medium without hydrolysate, with either xylose or glucose as carbon source. in all other experiments the different strains were grown at a pretreatment liquor concentration of 50% . fermentation profiles of the recombinant xylose-utilising yeast grown on xylose are shown in figure  <dig>  with the fermentation profiles on glucose shown in figure  <dig>  tables  <dig> and  <dig> provide a summary of fermentation parameters calculated from duplicate batch experiments.

in the presence of 50% pretreatment liquor with 20 g/l xylose as carbon source, strain d5a+h displayed a marked improvement in terms of culture growth compared to the control strain as evident from a more than 10-fold increase in biomass concentration . strain d5a+h also exhibited a significantly shorter lag phase of less than 4 h compared to that of strain Тmb <dig> , which suggested that strain d5a+h exhibited a greater level of tolerance towards the inhibitors in the growth medium. however, there was no significant difference between the μmax values of strains d5a+h and Тmb <dig> . the performance of strain d5a+h stood in stark contrast to the poor growth and xylose utilisation of strain d5a+  in the presence of inhibitors. furthermore, in the absence of inhibitors, the parental d5a+ strain produced no ethanol, whereas an ethanol concentration of up to  <dig>  g/l at an ethanol yield  of  <dig>  g/g xylose was recorded for strain d5a+h in the presence of inhibitors. although low levels of glucose was present in the hydrolysate from pretreatment , this low concentration was insufficient to support an ethanol titre of  <dig>  g/l , pointing to improved ethanol fermentation from xylose by this strain subsequent to mutagenesis and evolutionary engineering.

xylose consumption by strain d5a+h closely followed culture growth attesting to its use as primary carbon source. on the other hand, marked xylose consumption by strain Тmb <dig> only occurred towards the end of the cultivation period , with the magnitude of xylose consumption apparently not strongly correlated with the increase in biomass concentration. in fact, the data revealed that strain d5a+h consumed 33% more xylose supplied to the culture than that consumed by strain tmb <dig> . this level of consumption was also reflected in the more than 7-fold greater biomass yield  on xylose by the latter strain , which suggested that a carbon source other than xylose was preferentially utilised by strain tmb <dig>  conversely, the low yx/s for strain d5a+h might be attributable to ethanol production. whereas no ethanol production was recorded for strain tmb <dig>  nor for strain d5a+ in the absence of liquor , an ethanol concentration of  <dig>  g/l was recorded for strain d5a+h , which pointed to increased efficiency in the conversion of xylose to ethanol, especially considering that the yx/s and yp/s values  for strain d5a+h were relatively similar .

the by-product time profiles for strains d5a+ tmb <dig> and d5a+h are shown in figure 2b, d and f, respectively. the largest decrease in by-products coincided with the exponential growth phase of strains d5a+h and tmb <dig>  this inverse correlation was especially evident in the case of strain tmb <dig> where a distinct biphasic profile was evident and could be related to the longer lag phase of this culture, which lasted for up to 42 h. the shorter lag phase of strain d5a+h coincided with earlier commencement of by-product utilisation and/or detoxification. no significant decrease in either organic acids or furaldehydes was observed in the d5a+ control culture, attributable to the absence of culture growth .

using glucose as carbon source, similar growth profiles were recorded for strains d5a+h  and tmb <dig>  in the presence of 50%  pretreatment liquor, which corresponded to that of the two reference strains, mh <dig> and mel <dig>  the μmax for strain d5a+h in the presence of inhibitors was marginally greater than that of the other strains , although a short lag phase of 4 h was apparent for this strain compared to the reference strains. the μmax for the parental d5a+ strain was more than 20-fold lower than that recorded for strain d5a+h . although the yx/s between the strains varied , the yx/s value of strain d5a+h was significantly greater than that of the other strains and could be related to the significantly greater biomass concentration recorded at the end of the exponential growth phase  and was corroborated by the significantly lower ethanol yield on glucose . in other words, strain d5a+h clearly produced less ethanol relative to biomass , although the greater biomass concentration of this strain resulted in an ethanol titre similar to that of the other strains at the end of the exponential growth phase. due to a severe lag phase in excess of 48 h recorded for the d5a+ parental strain, the data for this strain was omitted from figure  <dig>  the by-product profiles displayed in figure 3b, d, f and h showed a substantial decrease in the acetic acid concentration for strains d5a+h , tmb <dig> , mh <dig>  and mel <dig> , respectively. no clear pattern of formic acid removal was distinguishable for strains tmb <dig>  mh <dig> and mel <dig>  whereas the formic acid concentration in the culture of strain d5a+h decreased by more than 65% over the cultivation period.

supplying either glucose or xylose as the primary carbon source distinctly affected the yeast metabolism, evident from the absolute differences in the fermentation parameters presented in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  the most prominent differences between strains d5a+ and Тmb  <dig> are highlighted here. in the absence of pretreatment liquor with xylose as carbon source, the μmax of strain d5a+ was 34% lower than with glucose, whereas the biomass yield coefficient was almost 7-fold greater. ethanol production was absent with xylose as carbon source, whereas comparatively high levels of ethanol was produced on glucose. a similar response was evident for strain tmb <dig> where the μmax value on xylose was 36% lower than on glucose, with a substantially lower yx/s value on glucose , and complete absence of ethanol formation. although these perturbations were less pronounced in the case of strain d5a+h, the most prominent difference was the ability of the latter strain to produce ethanol when xylose was the sole source of carbon. however, xylose was not as effectively utilised as a fermentable carbon source compared to glucose .

strain performance during simultaneous saccharification and fermentation
fermentation profiles for strains d5a+h and tmb <dig> during simultaneous saccharification and fermentation  are presented in figure  <dig> using the water-insoluble solids  from steam-pretreated sweet sorghum bagasse as carbon source. although it would have been preferable to continue with triticale solids we were restricted to using limited amounts of sorghum solids, whereas most hydrolysate from triticale was consumed during continuous culture experiments. given that this section of the work was to provide a first order assessment of strain performance in ssf in the presence of inhibitors, we opted for an approach where triticale hydrolysate was used for hardening and sorghum was used for ssf work, in light of the relatively similar inhibitor concentrations in the hydrolysate from both feedstocks. although the pretreatment liquor was separated from the wis using a mechanical press, the solids were not washed prior to addition to the growth medium, which implied that a portion of the inhibitory by-products from the pretreatment liquor were carried into the ssf medium. a fed-batch fermentation strategy was employed to reduce broth viscosity and minimise exposure of the culture to high inhibitor levels, where feed times are indicated by the arrows.

on sweet sorghum bagasse solids, strain d5a+h produced 45% more ethanol than strain tmb <dig> reaching a maximum of  <dig>  g/l after 150 h. although this concentration equated to a very low 50% of the theoretical maximum, accounting for both glucose and xylose in the wis and assuming a sugar to ethanol conversion factor of  <dig>  g/g, this data served to illustrate the difference in the performance of the yeasts, since much room for ssf optimisation remains. for both strains, ethanol increased at the greatest rate before the third solids feed at 48 h, followed by a substantial decrease in the ethanol production rate. the profiles of residual glucose and xylose concentrations also differed distinctly between the two strains. for strain tmb <dig>  residual glucose levels remained consistently below 2 g/l throughout the fermentation, in spite of the addition of substrate at  <dig>   <dig> and 72 hrs. in the case of strain d5a+h, glucose accumulated to levels above  <dig>  g/l directly after the addition of substrate at  <dig> and 48 hrs, after which consumption again commenced. the accumulation in residual glucose in the culture of strain d5a+h, and to a lesser extent with strain tmb <dig>  coincided with the levelling off of ethanol production. with strain d5a+h a further increase in ethanol production again coincided with an increase in residual glucose consumption which occurred after approx. 96 h, whereas a less pronounced increase in ethanol production was evident for strain tmb <dig> after 118 h. no residual glucose was detected in the culture of strain d5a+h after  <dig> h, whilst a residual glucose concentration of  <dig>  g/l was recorded in the culture of strain tmb  <dig>  this observation suggested strong recovery by strain d5a+h from introduced toxic by-products after the third feed, especially in light of the final ethanol titres recorded in this culture, whereas the behaviour of strain tmb <dig> remained more consistent throughout the cultivation. xylose accumulated throughout the fermentation of both strains tmb <dig> and d5a+h, although the final residual xylose concentration was more than 35%  lower for strain tmb <dig> when compared to strain d5a+h .

discussion
two key strain development techniques, namely random mutagenesis and evolutionary engineering were sequentially used to harden a recombinant s. cerevisiae strain d5a+ against inhibitors from steam-pretreated triticale straw. simultaneously, selective pressure through xylose as carbon source was imposed during both steps to enhance the metabolism of this pentose sugar via the xi pathway. xylose isomerase represents the advantage of avoiding co-factor imbalances in the microbial metabolism at low oxygen tension, as opposed to the xr/xdh pathway, where xr was found to prefer nadph as co-factor  <cit> . furthermore, during evolutionary engineering, koppram et al.  <cit>  observed decreased xylose consumption by strain tmb <dig> , apparently due to competition for reductive power between xr and furaldehyde. an expected outcome from the present study would thus be improved xylose fermentation to ethanol in semi-aerobic culture in the presence of pretreatment liquor from xi expression.

given the complexity of the yeast metabolism on xylose as carbon source in the presence of inhibitors, random mutagenesis presented a more practical approach than rational metabolic engineering  <cit>  to simultaneously enhance xylose fermentation and inhibitor tolerance. as such, we resorted to chemical mutagenesis using ems where an expected outcome would be at least improved growth in the presence of hydrolysate inhibitors, using xylose as sole source of carbon compared to the parental strain as control. evolutionary engineering for at least  <dig> generations at a high dilution rate  with xylose as sole source of carbon and in the presence of inhibitors from non-detoxified liquor would have the expected outcome of enhanced tolerance evidenced by an improved μmax value, and ethanol yield and productivity compared to known benchmark strains. therefore, there is a clear correlation between the developmental steps employed and the outcomes expected from the study, namely  xylose fermentation from metabolic engineering using xi,  enhanced inhibitor tolerance and conversion from mutagenesis and evolutionary engineering, and  a superior phenotype for ethanol production from xylose or glucose also from mutagenesis and evolutionary engineering.

hardening methodology
the high dilution rate in our chemostat culture supplemented with hydrolysate would allow for strong selective pressure in favour of yeast cells with improved xylose carbon flow through the metabolism. in this way cells with high growth rate would be selected. most studies dealing with chemostat-based evolutionary engineering maintained continuous cultures at very low dilution rates in the region of d =  <dig>  to  <dig>  h- <dig>  <cit> . whereas low dilution rates are normally used to select for substrate affinity  <cit> , the purpose in our study was to select for high growth rate, given the negative effect that inhibitors have on the culture μmax  <cit> . this approach corresponds to the more frequent use of sequential batch culture for evolutionary engineering, where the culture would grow at μmax  <cit> . theoretically, evolved strains with the ability to maintain a higher growth rate should become dominant in a culture at a dilution rate close to μmax. an expected outcome would be an improvement in ethanol productivity, although this improvement was difficult to quantify in our work due to the absence of ethanol production by strain tmb <dig> and the parental strain in xylose batch cultures . the benchmark strains outperformed strain d5a+h in terms of ethanol productivity in glucose batch cultures .

strain performance with xylose as carbon source
an oxidative metabolism implies a greater biomass yield than would be the case with a respiro-fermentative metabolism and hence, a concomitant decrease in the ethanol yield  <cit> . this principle was patently evident from the data presented in tables  <dig> and  <dig> where the yx/s value of the parental d5a+ strain on glucose without hydrolysate supplementation was more than six-fold lower than when xylose was supplied as carbon source in the chemically defined medium, which implied a predominantly oxidative metabolism with xylose as carbon source. these observations could, on the one hand, support the notion that s. cerevisiae fails to recognise xylose as a fermentable carbon source  <cit> . on the other hand, the strain d5a+h produced  <dig>  g/l ethanol in the presence of 50%  pretreatment liquor, whereas no measurable ethanol was produced by strain tmb <dig> or by the parental d5a+ strain on xylose without pretreatment liquor . furthermore, strain d5a+ exhibited strong ethanol production from glucose at a yield of  <dig>  g/g glucose , which still makes it a prime candidate for 2nd generation ethanol production from cellulose. it is for the latter reason that the recombinant strain was subjected to mutagenesis and evolutionary engineering in an attempt to enhance xylose fermentation to ethanol, which was indeed accomplished. this result suggested that the mutagenesis treatment and/or evolutionary engineering profoundly affected the metabolism for funnelling carbon from xylose into the emp pathway for ethanol production. the reprogramming of these pathways was described by liu  <cit>  and could possibly have been responsible for our observed result. complete genomic analysis, coupled with transcriptomic analysis is earmarked for the future to elucidate the nature of this modification.

the negative impact of inhibitors on the ethanol productivity and yield  <cit>  as well as on the biomass yield due to interactions between furaldehydes and acetic acid  <cit>  is well described. previous reports also illustrated that yeast has a diminished ability to deal with the toxic effects exerted by lignocellulosic inhibitors when grown on xylose as carbon source  <cit> . this theoretical basis might explain why the parental strain d5a+ in the present study was unable to grow and retain viable cell numbers on xylose in the presence of 50%  pretreatment liquor . however, given this complete absence of growth of the un-adapted parental strain in the presence of inhibitors, the evolutionary engineering approach followed proved effective to introduce tolerance into the d5a yeast platform, as evident from the comparable μmax values of strains d5a+h and tmb <dig> . the fact that the μmax of  <dig>  h- <dig> of the adapted strain d5a+h on xylose in the presence of pretreatment liquor  pretreatment liquor) was 68% lower than that of the parental strain without hydrolysate clearly illustrated the toxic effect of the inhibitors on this yeast, in spite of the level of tolerance that was introduced into the yeast .

notably the μmax value of strain tmb <dig> recorded in the present study on xylose in the presence of pretreatment liquor was comparable to data published by wahlbom et al.  <cit>  for that strain in aerobic bioreactor cultures without pretreatment inhibitors. therefore, compared to strain d5a+h on xylose as carbon source, the presence of inhibitors appeared to have a less drastic effect on strain tmb <dig>  possibly attributable to the presence of xr. furfural was shown to serve as an effective electron acceptor for xr, as evident from decreased xylitol formation, resulting in an improved ethanol yield  <cit> , although no ethanol production by strain tmb <dig> on xylose was observed in the present study . furthermore, strain d5a+h exhibited a much shorter lag phase than strain tmb <dig>  where the lag phase for the latter strain lasted up to 30 h . a long lag phase in the presence of inhibitors is a known occurrence, attributable to the time required for the cells to carry out detoxification  <cit> . therefore, in spite of the inhibitory effect on strain d5a+h, the similarity of the growth rates between the two strains and the shorter lag phase pointed to our d5a+h strain as a possible candidate for further development for industrial fermentations.

the in situ conversion of hmf and furfural by strain d5a+h was clearly superior compared to the parental d5a+ strain and tmb  <dig> . hence, hmf and furfural removal commenced immediately after inoculation due to a comparatively shorter lag phase, and similar to that reported by palmqvist and hahn-hägerdal  <cit> . previous reports identified a range of oxido-reductases as the primary enzymes responsible for the in situ reduction of hmf and furfural to their less toxic alcohol derivatives  <cit> , such as the native reductases adh <dig> and adh <dig>  <cit> . one may, therefore, speculate on enhanced catalytic activity and/or higher degree of expression by one or more of these reductases brought on by mutagenesis and evolutionary engineering of strain d5a+h. less than 12% of the xylose consumed by strain d5a+h was converted to ethanol , which implies accumulation of another metabolite, since the total recovered carbon from biomass, ethanol and glycerol was only 60%. xylitol production has been observed in recombinant s. cerevisiae strains expressing xi and was ascribed to the endogenous activity of non-specific nadph-dependent aldo-ketoreductases expressed from the gre <dig> gene  <cit> . xylitol was not quantified during these fermentations, and future investigations will verify whether xylitol can account for these discrepancies in the carbon mass balance and transcriptomic profiling as well as enzyme activity data is required to validate this hypothesis.

the ability of strain d5a+h to attain high growth rates and a shorter lag phase in spite of the presence of weak organic acids may point to a decreased sensitivity towards anion accumulation. the more abundant organic acids, i.e. acetic and formic acid, also play a pivotal role in contributing to pretreatment liquor toxicity  <cit> . however these acids are typically not reduced in a typically enzyme-mediated manner, as is the case for hmf and furfural  <cit> , but rather accumulate intracellularly in dissociated form due to the neutrality of the cytosol  <cit> . the detoxification profiles show acetic and formic acid  decreasing over time, with the fastest overall removal of these weak acids apparent for strain d5a+h. this observation could probably be related to earlier onset of cell growth. the greater biomass concentration probably resulted in faster diffusion of weak acids down its concentration gradient into the cytoplasm of the yeast cells. although a large proportion of these anions were probably still secreted, this efflux was probably masked by increasing biomass and repetition of the cycle.

strain performance with glucose as carbon source
compared to the parental d5a+ strain in the absence of pretreatment liquor, the influence of inhibitors on the cultures with glucose as carbon source was clearly evident from μmax values that were up to  <dig> -fold lower  and qp values that were up to  <dig> -fold lower . this data clearly illustrated the dramatic negative effect of inhibitors on productivity rates, whereas the biomass and ethanol yield was affected to a much lesser extent and corresponded to data reviewed by liu  <cit> . although strain d5a+h surpassed strains Тmb  <dig>  mh <dig> and mel <dig> in terms of biomass yield and growth rate, this better performance did not correspond to higher ethanol productivity or yield during growth on glucose . the comparatively higher yx/s value of strain d5a+h on glucose could possibly be viewed as a secondary effect of mutagenesis and long term selection, since this trait was not observed in the parental yeast in the absence of pretreatment liquor. on the other hand, strains mh <dig> and mel <dig>  which had comparatively lower μmax values, produced ethanol at a significantly greater rate than strains d5a+h or Тmb <dig>  this result is not surprising, given the robust nature of these yeasts, specifically strain mh <dig>  which was purposefully included due to its high ethanol productivity  <cit> . the by-product detoxification profiles showed that both acetic and formic acid  decreased over time for all the strains. however, once again strain d5a+h outperformed the other strains since approximately 20% more acetic acid was removed than was the case with strain tmb <dig>  this observation supports our previous suggestion of a decreased sensitivity to these acids was brought about through mutagenesis and evolutionary engineering.

practical implementation through simultaneous saccharification and fermentation
whereas our results clearly demonstrated a degree of inhibitor tolerance by strain d5a+h, it is also of industrial importance to evaluate its effectiveness during ssf using steam-treated material. therefore the ability of this strain was assessed along with that of the benchmark strain tmb <dig> . a fed-batch approach was followed, to allow for a higher solids content of 10% , whilst minimising yeast inhibition  <cit> , and viscosity and mass transfer effects. the fed-batch strategy should also further assist in xylose metabolism by limiting the concentration of residual glucose  <cit> . strain d5a+h performed substantially better than strain tmb <dig> in ssf culture with pressed wis, producing 46% more ethanol at a combined  theoretical yield of 50% vs. 34% for strain tmb <dig>  the data recorded for strain d5a+h was slightly below that reported in the literature where ethanol yields from steam-pretreated sorghum ranged between 60-64% of theoretical maximum  <cit> . although xylose was poorly utilised by strain d5a+h in ssf culture, as evident from accumulation of residual xylose , it is possible that the greater ethanol titre produced by strain d5a+h could in part have stemmed from xylose, given the level of ethanol produced by this strain in batch cultures supplemented with hydrolysate and xylose . conversely, a possible explanation for the comparatively poor degree of xylose utilisation observed for the d5a+h strain during ssf could be attributed to residual glucose levels that remained high for a large portion of the total fermentation time, which may have resulted in the inhibition of xylose consumption. high concentrations of glucose are known to inhibit xylose transport in yeast, due to competition between the two substrates for the hexose transporters which have an inherently lower affinity for xylose  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the adaptation of yeast cultures for the production of ethanol from pretreated lignocellulosic substrates is of critical importance due to the toxic nature of the broth after pretreatment. whereas other methods such as recursive breeding and genome shuffling may also be employed to beneficiate multi-allelic traits such as ethanol productivity and inhibitor tolerance  <cit> , the experimental plan followed in this study yielded promising results. therefore, we conclude that mutagenesis in combination with long term evolutionary engineering was successfully applied to introduce a greater level of tolerance in s. cerevisiae d5a+h, together with improved xylose fermentation. to the knowledge of the authors, this is one of very few studies where ems treatment followed by evolutionary engineering at high hydrolysate concentrations with xylose as the sole source of carbon was successfully applied to a strain of s. cerevisiae harbouring the xi pathway for xylose consumption, resulting in comparatively superior performance to a known yeast benchmark. the physiological changes achieved in this study included an improved ability to ferment xylose in the presence of steam pretreated triticale straw liquor in batch culture. future studies will include a second phase of long-term adaptation with emphasis on selection for increased ethanolic fermentation of xylose in the presence of pretreatment liquor, by keeping the fermentation broth strictly anaerobic. additionally, genome sequencing as well as transcriptomic profiling of d5a+h will be focused upon to elucidate the nature of the molecular mechanisms of tolerance inferred through the experimental approaches presented in this study, followed by directed mutagenesis at selected targets using a rational approach.
