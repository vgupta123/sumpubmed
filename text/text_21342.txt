BACKGROUND
a copy number variant  is defined as a chromosomal segment, at least  <dig> kb in length, whose  copy number varies across individuals in the human population  <cit> . as the importance of these duplications and deletions in the study of a variety of diseases  <cit>  is being realized, cataloging them and assessing their frequencies has become an important goal. toward this end, two recent studies  <cit>  have exploited erroneous snp genotype calls, inferring germline deletions at clusters of calls that violate mendelian inheritance or other conditions. the violations occur, however, as a result of the  assumption of three possible genotypes  at each snp site. if this assumption of two copies at each locus were relaxed, one could consider a generalized genotype whereby the snp is multi-allelic when considering both base residue and copy number. an individual could carry, for example, a ggt , g – , or –  genotype at a snp locus. as most recent estimates put the proportion of the genome harboring cnvs at at least 12%  <cit> , allowing for more general genotypes is crucial for the accuracy of snp typing in disease studies. such direct and accurate typing would, of course, reveal cnvs automatically.

the genechip human mapping array set  <cit>  is a popular platform for high throughput snp genotyping. we use data from the version of the platform – herein referred to as the snp array – that interrogates over  <dig>  snp sites. since 85% of the genome is within  <dig> kb of at least one snp on the array  <cit> , many of the duplications and deletions of the size that have been reported thus far should contain several of the snp sites represented on the array. indeed,  <dig>  of its  <dig>  autosomal snps are contained in at least one of the cnvs that have been reported in the literature to date and catalogued in the database of genomic variants  <cit> . in an earlier study  <cit>  we utilized the array data to detect, in an allele-specific manner, somatic copy number changes in cancer samples, also demonstrating an extremely high genotyping accuracy  in the diallelic setting. we therefore endeavored in the present study to adapt this approach to snp array data from "phenotypically normal" individuals in an effort to provide a generalized genotype, allowing for germline cnvs as described above. the approach is somewhat akin to array cgh  <cit>  methods to detect cnvs, but with at least two advantages. first, it is difficult in array cgh analysis to determine whether an apparent deviation from copy number two is the result of a cnv in the test sample or in the reference sample. in our approach, we exploit a large reference panel of individuals, ensuring that the reference signal is essentially two-copy, except potentially in regions with very common cnvs. second, while the array cgh platforms lack allele-specific information, the snp array is comprised of oligonucleotide probes that can distinguish between each of the two alleles of each snp. our method models these probes' intensities as a function of allele-specific copy number, which directly determines the generalized genotype. the copy numbers are inferred from the snp array data by applying statistical model-fitting procedures.

RESULTS
detected aberrations
we analyzed snp array data from a collection of  <dig> individuals of various ethnic backgrounds. for a reference panel, we used  <dig> unrelated individuals of african, african-american, asian, european, and hispanic ethnicities . an ethnically diverse panel of reference samples minimizes the likelihood of a recurrent cnv skewing the "copy number two" reference signal. applying our algorithm to all automsomal snps on the array, we found  <dig>  snp loci that demonstrated aberrant genotypes . of these,  <dig>  were detected as duplications ,  <dig>  as hemizygous deletions , and  <dig> as homozygous deletions . there were  <dig> sites that were detected as both duplications and deletions. the  <dig>  snps can be grouped into  <dig>  regions of consecutive duplicated snps and  <dig>  regions of consecutive deleted snps regarding recurrence,  <dig>   snps were aberrant in more than one individual , with one snp  showing a non-diploid genotype in  <dig> of the  <dig> individuals.

experimental validation
in order to validate our discoveries using independent experimental means, we performed quantitative real-time pcr  experiments for  <dig> of the regions containing putatively aberrant snps, using dna from individuals in our sample set. a comparison of the qpcr results with our genotype inferences is given in table  <dig>  overall,  <dig>  of the qpcr results agreed with the presence and type  of cnv predicted by our in silico approach. there are a variety of potential reasons for the four nonconcordant loci. since the pcr primers are explicitly designed to avoid the snp sites , and since cnvs can be quite focal, it is possible for the pcr-amplified region to miss the aberrant locus entirely. a detected deletion could also be an artifact of the snp array assay, since the deletion or duplication elsewhere in the restriction fragment may result in its length moving outside the range of lengths that the assay's pcr step would amplify  <cit> . as mentioned above, common cnvs in the human population are another potential source of error, since it is implicitly assumed that the reference panel primarily harbors two copies per cell at each locus. to provide further independent validation, we also performed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification   <cit>  experiments on  <dig> other putative cnvs . the concordance with the in silico genotypes was similar to that of the qpcr results.

mendelian inheritance considerations
it is well-established  <cit>  that there are genomic regions harboring germline cnvs in the form of both duplications and deletions in different individuals. indeed, the non-allelic homologous recombination model of the formation of the variants generates both duplications and deletions, simultaneously at the same locus. it follows that, as these variants segregate through the population, there will be individuals carrying both a gain and a loss at the same locus, though on different parental chromosomes. the observable patterns of mendelian inheritance in the aberrant genotype setting are different from those in diallelic snp genotyping or even in aggregate copy number measurement, and ignoring the presence of cnvs can result in the false appearance of non-mendelian inheritance as a result of genotyping errors . truly non-mendelian inheritance, e.g. de novo events  can be masked as well. these errors will also occur when only aggregate copy number is measured but allelic information is ignored. misinterpreting germline cnvs as de novo, or vice versa, can have important implications, particularly in clinical settings where such variants in an affected individual are considered less relevant when inherited from an unaffected parent  <cit> . with multi-allelic snp genotypes, we should be able to distinguish between the two cases. we were able to check aberrant snps for mendelian inheritance in the  <dig> mother-father-child trios in our data set. accounting for both snp and copy number variation,  <dig>  of the  <dig>  instances of putatively aberrant snps in the four individuals  demonstrated mendelian inheritance. possible explanations for non-mendelian events include de novo cnvs or uniparental disomy, both of which have been detected using the snp array platform  <cit> . alternatively, detected cnvs may be instead artifacts of cell line culture, as observed in  <cit> .

snp alleles in duplications
examination of the snp allelic composition of duplicated regions can provide insight into the history of copy number variation in the human population. in the case of a snp site that is duplicated with  copy number two, there are theoretically five possible haploid genotypes for that snp: aa, ab, bb, a, and b, where a and b are the two base residues for the snp site. the presence or absence of each of these five haploid genotypes sheds light on recurrence and temporal order of both the duplication event at that locus as well as the point mutation that resulted in the snp. for example, the presence of both aa and bb would imply a recurrent duplication, occurring on both the a and b snp background. to investigate empirically, we examined  <dig> aberrant loci in detail . we found no evidence of a single chromosome with different base residues on each copy of a duplication  . it is therefore unlikely that the "snp in duplicon" phenomenon noted recently  <cit>  for segmental duplications is common in cnvs. this is also consistent with the conclusion of the hapmap consortium  <cit>  that the point mutations leading to snps are largely non-recurrent. in the vast majority of cases, only one of the snp alleles was duplicated in our sample set. still, six  of the snp sites had evidence of both aa and bb chromosomes. the presence of both types show that at least some duplication events were most likely recurrent in human history . an example is rs <dig> on chromosome  <dig> , which is contained in a previously known recurrently duplicated region  <cit> . in our data set, one caucasian family – na <dig>  and na <dig>  – harbors the duplication with the c allele at the snp in both copies. japanese individual na <dig>  on the other hand, harbors the duplication with the g allele at the snp in both copies. interestingly, the dbsnp database  <cit>  lists the allele frequency for c as 65% in the caucasian population, but only 15% for the japanese population. these duplications were observed independently in  <cit>  in all three of these individuals, though the snp allelic information was ignored in that study. similarly, the snp array manufacturer's  <cit>  diallelic calls, cc for na <dig> and gg for na <dig>  were erroneous though consistent with what was expected given their two-copy assumption. this example points to the insights that can be gained from consideration of both copy number and snp residue simultaneously.

comparison with previous work
since our detected aberrant snps automatically indicate the presence of cnvs, we compared the genomic coordinates of these loci to cnvs previously reported in the literature. of our  <dig>  snp loci,  <dig>  are contained in regions catalogued as cnvs in the database of genomic variants, while only  <dig> % of the  <dig>  autosomal snps on the snp array are contained in these regions. though this demonstrates more overlap than would be expected by chance, the majority of loci we have uncovered are novel. however, one would expect that recurrently variant snps in our data set would often exist at a higher frequency in the general population, and would thus be more likely to have been previously discovered. indeed, if we restrict our attention to snps that are aberrant in at least two unrelated individuals in our sample set, we find that  <dig> of  <dig>  of these lie in previously reported cnvs. as the aberrance rate of a snp in our sample increases, its likelihood of having been previously reported continues to rise – over 95% of the  <dig> snps that are aberrant in at least 10% of our unrelated sample set are contained in previously reported cnvs. therefore, although we report thousands of new cnvs, our results are in some sense concordant with what has been revealed on a population level. since it has been shown that sequence between intrachromosomal segmental duplications are predisposed to cnvs  <cit> , we also checked for enrichment of these "hotspots"  <cit>  in our set of cnvs. only  <dig>   of our aberrant snp loci were contained in these regions reported in the structural variation database, which is only a slightly higher proportion than that of all autosomal snps on the array .

genes in regions of copy number variation
many genes previously confirmed as polymorphic have functions in metabolism and immunity, and likely act as mediators of normal human variation as well as genomic disease. we compiled a list of transcribed cnvs in our data, along with the gene ontology  <cit>   terms that were associated to these transcripts. we examined our list for go terms that were present at a statistically higher rate compared to all genes containing snps represented on the array . this allowed the identification of several interesting categories of genes involved in cell surface structure, glutamate metabolism and signaling, and genes with metabolic, enzymatic and neurological functions. in concordance with previous studies, we confirmed the presence of cnvs in genes such as dusp <dig>  ncam <dig>  <cit> , and nf <dig>  <cit> . also present in our list are genes that are known to influence "normal" human phenotypes, such as the copy number-polymorphic olfactory receptor genes  <cit> , and the neuropeptide-y <dig> receptor ppyr <dig>  <cit>  that is directly involved in the regulation of food intake and body weight  <cit> . a number of "environmental sensor" genes involved in immune system response were also observed, in categories such as granulocyte differentiation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, antibiotic response, regulation of igg/ige isotype switching, regulation of nk cell activity, il- <dig> receptor binding and mhc class  <dig> receptor activity. in addition, a large proportion of the cnv-enriched classes have receptor and/or signaling functions. it is important to note that a number of genes previously reported to be copy number variant, such as the glutathione s-transferase genes gstm <dig> and gstt <dig>  are not represented on the snp array, perhaps due to the fact that they would give ambiguous genotype calls.

CONCLUSIONS
we have presented the first computational method for genotyping snps from microarray data in the general case where the individual is not restricted to two copies of the snp locus per cell. our work highlights, with several examples, the relevance of considering both copy number and snp allelic information simultaneously. we have uncovered tens of thousands of snps with aberrant genotypes in humans of various ethnicities, corresponding to thousands of novel cnvs. it is likely that our results actually drastically underrepresent the prevalence of aberrant snps in the population, as the array's manufacturer deliberately excluded snps that violated hardy-weinberg equilibrium, mendelian inheritance, and other quality control requirements  <cit>  that would naturally not be met in the presence of cnvs. moreover, our own requirement that at least three consecutive snps show the cnv is very conservative, and will by definition omit more focal events . it follows that the number and frequency of these multi-allelic snps segregating through the population is likely to be much more substantial than previously suspected, and therefore generalized genotyping of the sort we have described here is crucial in studies using snps as markers. our work is a step in that direction, though the goal should be to attain the high rates of accuracy  that are assumed in the diallelic setting. such highly accurate genotyping would automatically provide information regarding the presence or absence of cnvs. given the difficulty in precisely mapping the boundaries of these germline cnvs , and given the density of snps on the genome, we propose aberrant snp genotyping as an alternative to other methods of categorizing cnvs from snp array data  <cit> . such genotypes map to precise genomic locations, and provide information on both copy number and base residue. the resulting multi-allelicism will be an aid to disease association studies, whether these more accurately ascertained snp alleles are actually causal inherited variants, or are simply used as markers. since there are many thousands of snp array samples extant, these multi-allelic snps segregating through the population will be identified and their frequencies ascertained. we have developed software, freely available at our web site, with which users can scan their arrays for aberrant snps, using reference panels of their choice. as the platforms increase in throughput and decrease in cost, accurate multi-allelic genotyping will be even more crucial.
