BACKGROUND
identifying the genetic basis of interesting phenotypic variation in non-model systems is often limited by the lack of sophisticated molecular resources, such as complete genome sequences and dna microarrys, that are available in model genetic taxa such as drosophila  <cit> , anopheles  <cit> , caenorhabditis  <cit>  and apis  <cit> . however, the declining costs of developing genomic tools and the proliferation of accessible methods by which these tools can be generated holds promise for genomic-scale studies in organisms that offer profound insights into fundamental biological questions. thus, there is a growing need to develop better genomic resources for these emerging systems.

the orthoptera contain many such emerging systems. consisting of over  <dig>  species  <cit> , the order orthoptera is composed of two major lineages, the crickets and katydids  and the grasshoppers   <cit>  which diverged approximately  <dig> mya. while well known for their economic impact on world-wide agriculture  <cit> , they have been intensively studied in a wide variety of biological areas. for example, orthopterans have been used to study various aspects of neurobiology  <cit> , physiology  <cit> , behavior  <cit> , development  <cit> , sexual selection  <cit> , and evolution  <cit> . however, very few genomic tools have been developed for this group of insects.

while genomic studies of many orthoptera are ongoing  <cit> , large scale genomic resources have been developed for only one species in this order, locusta migratoria   <cit> . research on locusta has produced  <dig>  unique sequences and provides a necessary counterpoint to the heavy phylogenetic bias in extant genomic resources.  <cit> . however, as described above, orthopterans are a phylogenetically diverse lineage which are being used to study a broad set of biological questions. the gene index presented here was developed to address three distinct but overlapping areas of orthopteran biology: neurobiology, speciation, and evolution.

for over  <dig> years, the orthoptera have been used as a neurobiological model system by which the relationship between neural activity, muscular response and behavior are studied  <cit> . in particular, the study of orthopteran flight and song, or stridulation, have provided valuable insights into the physiological basis of behavior and the structure and function of central pattern generating  circuits  <cit> . cpg circuits are responsible not only for orthopteran flight and song, but also for nearly all vital functions, such as circulation, respiration, digestion and locomotion, in both vertebrates and invertebrates. since at least  <dig>  neuroethologists have called for the development of genetic tools to understand the creation, function, and diversification of the neural circuits responsible for cricket stridulation  <cit> . one result has been the analysis of the inheritance of species-specific songs  <cit>  and a quantitative trait locus study of song . yet the tools necessary to study the action and influence of individual genes remain largely absent. the est's of this gene index, since they are derived from a nerve cord library, contain genes expressed in nervous system. many of the est's identified here may be involved in the construction of the flight and/or stridulation cpg.

furthermore, our study organism, laupala kohalensis, is a superb organism with which to investigate the genetic basis of cpg construction and evolution. the  <dig> species of laupala have diverged within the past five million years  <cit> . the diversification of laupala has been extraordinarily rapid, as laupala contains the fastest diversifying arthropod clade recorded to date  <cit> . the radiation is also noteworthy for the extremely limited number of features that distinguish species. members of this genus appear morphologically and ecologically similar and many closely related species often differ by fewer than  <dig> % of nuclear gene bases  <cit> . however, pulse rates of male calling songs have diverged extensively in laupala  <cit> . given the diversity of pulse rate cpg's in this clade and the limited amount of genetic divergence that separates species, the release of the laupala gene index will provide an extraordinary genomic tool by which cpg evolution may be studied.

in addition to providing a powerful platform for comparative studies of cpg evolution, laupala is a well-developed model system for the study of reproductive isolation and the formation of species  <cit> . the  <dig> species within this genus are believed to have diverged in part via coordinated evolution in male song and female acoustic preference  <cit> . while there exists an extensive body of literature on the evolution of sexual isolation and the formation of species, identifying the specific genetic basis of either process has been limited to an extremely small number of taxa for which the appropriate genetic tools have been developed. the release of this cricket gene index will allow researchers to build on the genetic work of hoy and paul  <cit> , which demonstrated a polygenetic basis of cricket songs, and shaw  <cit> , which supported hoy and paul's findings and identified several chromosomal regions associated with song, by providing the tools necessary to identify specific genes involved in cricket stridulation, sexual isolation and the formation of species. identifying the genes involved in any of these processes would represent a significant achievement.

from a comparative perspective, the publication of the laupala gene index is a significant advancement in the tools available to study molecular evolution in insects. to date, major insect genome projects have focused primarily on the diptera , hymenoptera , and lepidoptera . all of these lineages belong to a single superorder  and, thus, represent only a small portion of the phylogenetic diversity encompassed by the broader class insecta . while the evolution of complete metamorphosis  was certainly one of the most significant events in the history of insect diversification  <cit> , the heavy phylogenetic bias of previously developed genomic resources has severely limited broader inferences about the evolutionary history of insects in general. indeed, only recently have researchers begun to address this phylogenetic bias in studies of arthropod evolution  <cit>  and the genomes of an aphid  <cit>  and louse  <cit>  soon will be available. therefore, the compilation of a basal insect genomic resource, such as the one presented here, will facilitate genomic comparisons across  <dig> million years of insect diversification, and will serve as a phylogenetic link to even more distant comparisons, such as crustaceans  and chelicerates , and beyond. for example, one of the early developmental studies of arthropod body patterning genes utilized est sequences cloned from schistocerca  and tribolium  to demonstrate the homology between the drosophila hox gene zen and its' human ortholog, hox <dig>  <cit> . thus, the benefits of developing sophisticated genomic resources for non-model organisms are potentially much broader than typically recognized.

the current study represents the first major initiative to develop a large genomic resource for a cricket species of the orthopteran suborder ensifera . we present the sequences of  <dig>  expressed sequence tags  from a laupala kohalensis nerve cord cdna library. we expect that the release of this gene index will provide much needed tools for the study of cpg construction and evolution, sexual selection and speciation, and the molecular evolution of arthropods.

RESULTS
two separate, normalized cdna libraries were constructed from a single pool of rna extracted from the nerve cord tissue of several individual crickets. a total of approximately  <dig>  clones were isolated from these libraries.  <dig> clones were sequenced from the first library ;  <dig> clones were sequenced from the second library . a total of  <dig>  sequences were generated. preliminary sequence analysis revealed that 5' end sequencing of the est's provided higher quality reads than those generated from the 3' end. as a result, the majority of our sequencing effort was directed at sequencing the 5' end of the est's.  <dig>  sequences were generated from the 5' end and  <dig> sequences were generated from the 3' end of the insert. of the  <dig>  sequences,  <dig>  were greater than  <dig> bases after the vector and linker sequences were stripped. of these  <dig>  sequences, read lengths ranged from  <dig> bases to  <dig> bases. the average read length was  <dig> bases. table  <dig> summarizes the results of the cdna sequencing and basic bioinformatics analysis. all  <dig>  sequences were submitted to genbank and can be accessed through the accession numbers eh628894-eh <dig> 

a gene index was created from these  <dig>  acceptable sequences  <cit> . we identified  <dig>  unique sequences, representing  <dig>  singletons and  <dig> tentative consensus sequences . tentative consensus sequences are composed of multiple sequencing reads with overlapping sequence alignments. the  <dig>  tcs were derived from  <dig>  est's  and ranged in length from  <dig> bases to  <dig>  bases, with an average length of  <dig> bases. the number of est's per tc ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  with a mean number of  <dig>  est's per tc. the remaining unique sequences were composed of single est's. singleton sequences ranged in size from  <dig> bases to  <dig> bases, with an average length of  <dig> bases .

the  <dig>  unique sequences were translated into all  <dig> possible reading frames and compared using blat  <cit>  against a comprehensive non-redundant protein database maintained by the dana-farber cancer institute. this database contains ~ <dig> million entries collected from uniprot, swisspro, refseq, genbank resources and additional sequences from tigr and its affiliates. the blat algorithm is integrated into the gene indexing bioinformatics pipeline to reduce computing times when building and annotating other large gene indices . in future releases, the pipeline may be modified to use additional algorithms, such as blastx, when working with more limited and/or phylogenetically distinct gene indices such as our cricket gene index.

 <dig>  of the  <dig>   unique sequences had a significant sequence similarity match to an entry in the protein database .  <dig>   unique sequences returned no significant matches to entries in the database and no putative function could be assigned to them. however,  <dig>  of the  <dig>   sequences that did not return a significant match to a protein in the database were identified by estscan  <cit>  as having putative orf's with an average length of  <dig> nucleotides. this suggests that the majority of these unidentified est's are expected to encode a protein and highlights the dearth of genomic information available for basal insect taxa.

the observed sequence similarities produced by the comparative analysis are consistent with our expectations given the tissue from which the cdna library was constructed. while some of the unique sequences are similar to housekeeping genes, many unique sequences are similar to genes that may influence stridulation . for example, several unique sequences are similar to genes that regulate the timing of biological events , while others are involved with nervous system signal transduction  and others contribute to developmental events that shape either the nervous system  or wing development . in addition to potentially influencing our primary phenotype, many of these sequences will be useful to researchers interested in insect neural function  and insect molecular evolution .

within our unigene set, we identified a number of genes that would be of comparative interest. to explore the laupala unigene set as a comparative utility we compared the sequence of ten est's from our unigene set to unigene sets available in drosophila melanogaster, anophelese gambiae, bombyx mori, apis mellifera, tribolium casteneum, and locusta migatoria . the results show the evolutionary distinctiveness and phylogenetic distance between laupala sequences and est sequences from other genomic models. across the ten est's, the mean uncorrected sequence divergence  between laupala and the other insect taxa surveyed was 30%. furthermore, the mean distance between laupala and locusta was 89% that of the mean pairwise distance of all taxa in the analysis. thus, despite the fact that laupala and locusta are both members of the insect order orthoptera, the sequence divergence between them for this sample of est's is close to that found among other insect orders.

of the  <dig>  sequences that matched protein entries,  <dig> sequences could be assigned a gene ontology  term .  <dig> biological process go terms were associated with predicted amino acid sequences from these  <dig> sequences. the  <dig> most frequent biological process go terms are presented in figure  <dig>  the majority of biological process go terms  were assigned to five or fewer of the  <dig> sequences present and no biological process go term was assigned to more than  <dig> sequences.  <dig> molecular function go terms were associated with amino acid sequences identified in the  <dig> unique sequences. the  <dig> most frequent molecular function go terms are presented in figure  <dig>  the majority of molecular function go terms  were assigned to five or fewer sequences. one molecular function go term was assigned to  <dig> of the  <dig> sequences .  <dig> cellular compartment go terms were associated with predicted amino acid sequences identified in the  <dig> unique sequences. the  <dig> most frequent cellular compartment go terms are presented in figure  <dig>  the  <dig> unique sequences contained  <dig> predicted nuclear proteins, and this was the most frequent cellular compartment go term. again, the majority of these go terms,  <dig> , were assigned to no more than five of the  <dig> sequences.

the low redundancy of the go terms, in addition to the large proportion of singletons in the library and the small number of est's per tc, testify that the normalization was successful and that a large proportion of the genes expressed in the cricket developing nerve cord were identified. the putative function of the singletons and tentative consensus sequences, as inferred from the blat comparison and the go term assignments, is consistent with genes expected to be expressed in a nerve cord.

discussion
we completed an est sequencing project to characterize genes expressed in the cricket nerve cord that underlie pulse rate of male song in l. kohalensis. by constructing a cdna library from nymphal and adult crickets, our aim was to enhance the discovery of genes involved in the construction of the central pattern generating circuit  underlying rhythmic singing behavior. in addition, we enriched for full-length cdna by utilizing a template-switching reverse transcriptase . furthermore, we increased the representation of genes expressed in low-copy number by normalizing our amplified cdna using a double-stranded nuclease . sequencing of ~ <dig>  clones from this library by the institute for genomic research  produced  <dig>  high quality est's with an average length greater than  <dig> bases . assembly of these est's produced  <dig>  unique sequences. we were then able to annotate  <dig>  of these genes based on blat protein comparisons against a comprehensive non-redundant protein database maintained by the dana-farber cancer institute. of these annotated genes, we could assign gene ontology  terms to  <dig> genes. the diversity of our library is reflected in the large number of different go terms assigned to these genes, including  <dig> biological process,  <dig> molecular functions, and  <dig> cellular compartment go terms, and suggests that we were successful in our attempt to normalize cdna representation in our library.

cricket gene index
a gene index based on our est sequencing project was assembled and is publicly-available at  <cit> . this electronic resource consists of a description of the cricket est library, including a summary of the number of unique sequences, the distribution of tentative consensus  sequences, gene annotations, go terms, and a set of 70-mer oligonucleotide probes. the cricket gene index thus joins more than  <dig> other animal gene indices hosted by dfci and represents the second largest est resource for orthoptera available online. while the cricket est project sequenced roughly one third of that sequenced by the locusta migratoria project  this disparity is not reflected in the total number of unique sequences identified by these two projects .

crickets as models for behavioral genomics
species of orthoptera have long served as neurophysiological models of behavior. our analysis of  <dig>  est sequences and subsequent production of  <dig> singletons and tentative consensus sequences from a nerve cord derived library represents a major advance in the available genomic resources for the study of cricket neurophysiology and behavior. this resource will provide valuable tools with which to examine the underlying genetic basis of cricket stridulation, a model for the study of central pattern generation . the resources presented here represent the first opportunity to analyze the neurophysiologic process of stridulation at the genomic scale.

developing additional genomic resources for laupala
we are utilizing multiple approaches in order to dissect the genetic basis of pulse rate variation in laupala. in addition to ongoing qtl mapping efforts  <cit>  , the laupala gene index is a first step towards two additional genetic approaches to our study of pulse rate evolution. first, the oligonucleotide probe set developed from our gene index is the backbone of an oligonuclelotide micoarray being constructed to study gene expression in laupala. these microarrays will be used to study patterns of gene expression across multiple species  <cit>  to identify candidate genes whose expression varies with pulse rate. second, the est's are being screened for variation that can be used in a linkage analysis. placing these est's on the laupala linkage map will facilitate comparisons between the qtl analysis and the study of gene expression. the identification of candidate genes that fall within qtl regions will strengthen the support for these candidate genes and guide our choice of which genes to use in functional studies. furthermore, estimating the linkage relationships of est's within laupala and comparing them with known orthologs in model systems will allow us to identify regions of synteny across multiple species. establishing such areas of synteny is another powerful approach to identifying strong candidate genes  <cit> . given the now rich genomic resources available in laupala, the extensive divergence of male song cpg and its influence on reproductive isolation, and the fairly limited genetic divergence within this genus, laupala represents an excellent system to study the evolutionary genomics of cpg diversification.

in addition, the development of genomic resources in laupala can be used to tackle some of the most urgent topics in evolutionary biology. few other systems provide both the genomic tools and evolutionary power necessary to provide an understanding of how gene expression evolves in recently diverged taxa  <cit> . furthermore, because male pulse rate plays a critical function in reproductive isolation in this genus, identifying the genes whose expression contributes to the construction of this phenotype will provide insight into how the evolution of gene expression contributes to reproductive isolation during the course of speciation  <cit> .

comparative genomics in insects
in the last  <dig> years, there has been a proliferation of genomic resources available for model organisms. as technology has improved, whole genome sequences have become available for a growing number of species and for the first time comparative studies of entire genomes have become possible  <cit> . however, the phylogenetic breadth of insect species in which genomic tools have been developed is extremely limited. for example, of the  <dig> insect genomes sequencing projects currently completed or under way,  <dig>  involve species of drosophila. the remaining species are either directly related to human health   <cit> , or are of agriculture importance . the only species with significant genomic tools that is not of biomedical or agricultural importance is the african butterfly , an evo-devo model for wing pattern development  <cit> . the vast majority of these insects are holometabolous and possess relatively small genomes  <cit> . however, this severe phylogenetic and genome-size bias limits comparative studies of insect and arthropod evolution . the cricket gene index presented here represents a significant contribution to the genomic resources available for comparative molecular studies of basal insect lineages . based on our preliminary comparative analysis, laupala, a representative of the orthopteran suborder ensifera, is as distinct from locusta, a representative of the califeran suborder of the orthoptera, as it is from other insect orders.

CONCLUSIONS
we document the sequencing of  <dig>  est's derived from a laupala kohalensis nerve cord cdna library. from these  <dig>  sequences,  <dig>  unique sequences were identified. just over 60% of the unique sequences,  <dig> , had a predicted protein sequence significantly similar to a sequence in a non-redundant protein database. of these, gene ontology terms could be assigned to  <dig> of the putative proteins. this resource was developed to address fundamental questions of biological interest. our interests lie in identifying genes that contribute to the diversification of male song pulse rate and, by extension, speciation within the hawaiian cricket genus laupala. the release of this resource, however, has a much broader impact than that prescribed by our interests. neuroethologists studying the construction and function of cpg neural circuits in insects have lamented the lack of available genetic tools necessary to study these vital neurobiological phenotypes. the release of the laupala gene index contributes to meeting this need. likewise, evolutionary biologists have lacked diverse systems with which fundamental evolutionary processes might be addressed at the genomic scale. empirical data can be collected using the laupala resource to examine the evolution of gene expression during the speciation process. finally, the release of this gene index begins to rectify an extreme phylogenetic bias in the availability of genomic resources in insects and will facilitate comparative studies of molecular evolution across  <dig> my of arthropod evolution.
