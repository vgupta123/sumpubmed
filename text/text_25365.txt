BACKGROUND
during the development of the vertebrate retina, five types of neurons are born in a preserved sequential but overlapping order  <cit> . these are retinal ganglion cells, horizontal cells , amacrine cells, bipolar cells and photoreceptors. in the mature retina, these cell types are positioned within distinct laminas and can be further divided into subtypes based on morphology, neurochemical properties or function. at the end of the 19th century, ramón y cajal recognized this complex lamination and morphological richness of the retina as well as identified retinal subtypes based on morphology. today, neuronal subtypes are defined and distinguished by molecular and functional criteria rather than by morphology. approximately 50– <dig> neuronal subtypes can be identified in the mature retina depending on the species  <cit> .

horizontal cells, which are the focus of this study, have been found in all vertebrate retinas from fish to man  <cit> . they are interneurons situated between photoreceptors and bipolar cells and form synapses with both cell types. in the chick retina, hcs form a distinct layer of cells that we will refer to as the horizontal cell layer , in the outermost part of the inner nuclear layer . two kinds of hcs are found in vertebrate retinas; axon-bearing and axon-less hcs  <cit> . an exception are retinas from several rodents, including mice, where only one hc type is identified  <cit> . in several species of fish, turtles, birds and mammals  a third hc subtype have been identified or suggested  <cit> . regardless of the actual number of hc subtypes, the axon-bearing hc is present in all species and additional subtypes are axon-less  <cit> . the chick retina has three hc subtypes that have been identified based on their distinct morphological appearances  <cit> . one is the axon-bearing "brush-shaped" hc  and the two others are axon-less hcs, denoted "stellate"  and "candelabrum-shaped"  hcs. the brush-shaped hc axon-terminus mainly connects to rod photoreceptors, whereas the dendritic trees of all three hcs mainly form connections with cone photoreceptors  <cit> . this functional organisation appears to be conserved within vertebrate retinas  <cit> .

a rich literature on the morphological and functional properties of hc subtypes exists but less is known about the developmental events underlying their generation. recent studies have demonstrated that transcription factors such as foxn <dig>  ptf1a and prox <dig> are pivotal for the generation of the axon-bearing hcs in mice  <cit> , and retinas deficient of the cell cycle inhibitors ink4d and kip <dig> overproduce those hcs  <cit> . in addition to intrinsic regulators like these, extrinsic factors are known to modulate different aspects of retinal development including proliferation, determination, differentiation and cell survival/death. members of the transforming growth factor β/bone morphogenetic protein  family of growth factors are known to function as modulators during neuronal development  <cit>  and an involvement of these molecules during the generation of retinal neurons have been suggested  <cit> . follistatin which is an endogenous inhibitor of activin, tgf-β  <dig>  gdf- <dig>  and several other tgfβ/bmp molecules  <cit> , is known to be expressed in the developing retina and pigment epithelium  <cit> . interestingly, a recent study indicated that the generation of hcs may be affected by follistatin  <cit>  since prox1+ cells were found scattered at ectopic locations following virus mediated over-expression of follistatin in the developing retina.

the aim of this study was to gain further understanding of how and when hc subtypes are generated. we have molecularly characterized hc subtypes and found that the transcription factors lim <dig> and isl <dig> are expressed in axon-bearing and axon-less hc subtypes, respectively. we demonstrate that the axon-bearing and axon-less hc subpopulations are molecularly defined early in development, have different but overlapping birth dates, migrate to the hcl at different times and that their relative numbers are not adjusted by apoptosis. endogenous follistatin expression is high during the earliest phase of retinal development, with levels dropping sharply at the time of hc generation. moreover, we show that follistatin overexposure at the time of hc-generation causes an increase in both the early-generated lim1+ axon-bearing and late isl1+ axon-less hcs when analyzed at embryonic day 9/hamburger & hamilton stage  <dig> . combined, these results imply that the two hc subgroups are defined early and are generated consecutively from a progenitor cell population that is sensitive to follistatin inhibition.

RESULTS
newly generated hcs express either lim <dig> or isl <dig> and constitute equally large populations
to identify immature hc subtypes several available antibodies against molecules known to be involved in neuronal determination were surveyed for reactivity to hcs. in addition to the transcription factors prox <dig> and lim <dig> that are expressed by immature hcs, isl <dig> was identified as a novel transcription factor expressed in immature hcs. the result of the antibody survey is reported elsewhere  <cit> . first we analysed whether all hcs expressed prox <dig> and pax <dig>  two well established hc markers, using flat-mounted retina sectioned through the hcl. the analysis showed that all cells located within the hcl expressed prox <dig> and pax <dig> . stage  <dig>  was selected for further analysis since the hcl is established within the inl at this age  <cit> . retinas were analysed with respect to prox <dig>  lim <dig> and isl <dig> expression. the results showed that lim <dig> and isl <dig> immunoreactivities did not overlap, and that lim <dig> and isl <dig> immunoreactive hcs were mixed within the hcl . by counting double-labelled cells in the hcl of the central-most retina, the ratio of lim1+ or isl1+ hcs were determined to be 50/ <dig> with respect to prox <dig> . these results reveal that hcs are split into two equally large sub-groups based on the expression of lim <dig> and isl <dig> 

isl <dig> hcs migrate one day after the lim <dig> hcs
we have previously shown that hcs expressing lim <dig> and prox <dig> perform a bi-directional migration within the retina  <cit> . we investigated whether isl1+ hcs performed a similar bi-directional migration by comparing the patterns of lim <dig> , prox <dig>  and isl <dig> . the spatio-temporal pattern of prox1+, isl1+ double-labelled cells was similar, but delayed to, the prox1+, lim1+ double-labelled cells that have been shown to migrate bi-directionally . the first prox1+, isl1+ double-labelled cells were detected close to the prospective ganglion cell layer  at st <dig> . during subsequent stages numerous prox <dig>  isl <dig> double-positive cells were seen scattered at various levels of the inl between st <dig> and st <dig> . our analysis suggests that prox1+, isl1+ double-labelled cells initiate retrograde migration and reach the hcl one day after lim1+ hcs.

isl <dig> hcs are born one day after lim <dig> hcs
to investigate if the segregated migration patterns reflected a temporal difference in birth-dates or just a delay in migration between the two subgroups, we birth-dated the two hc populations using -dt. stage 19– <dig> embryos received a single dose of -dt after which retinas were collected at st <dig>  and processed for lim <dig> and prox <dig> immunocytochemistry and autoradiography. stage  <dig> was analyzed since the mature 50/ <dig> ratio of lim1+ and isl1+ hcs is set at this stage . the fractions of lim1+ or prox1+ hcs also positive for -dt incorporation  were determined for each injected stage . since other retinal cell types in addition to hcs label for isl <dig>  <cit> , we inferred the birth-date of isl1+ hcs by analysing the hcs expressing prox <dig> but not lim <dig> 

our data demonstrated that the hc population in the central retina  was born between e <dig> and e <dig>  in accordance with previous observations  <cit> . furthermore, the birth of lim1+ hcs peaked between e <dig> to e <dig> , whereas the birth of prox1+, lim1-negative hcs  peaked between e <dig> to e <dig> .

lim <dig> is expressed by axon-bearing and isl <dig> by axon-less hcs
we investigated how the lim <dig> and isl <dig> expressing hc subgroups corresponded to the three hc subtypes previously identified by morphology  <cit> . post-hatch day  <dig>  retinas were analysed using confocal microscopy with antibodies against the known hc markers calretinin, gaba and trka  <cit>  in relation to lim <dig> and isl <dig> expression. p <dig> retina was chosen since the morphology of all three hc subtypes were difficult to assess at earlier stages using immunohistochemistry.

calretinin and lim <dig> were co-expressed in hcs that had morphology similar to the brush-shaped, axon-bearing hc . weak gaba labelling was detected in lim1+ hcs  while intense labelling was seen in a small subset of isl1+ hcs . this intense labelling was found in hcs with morphology similar to the axon-less stellate hc . trka was found exclusively in the majority of isl1+ hcs  that had morphology similar to axon-less candelabrum-shaped hcs .

gaba decreases in axon-bearing hcs from hatch to p7
gaba is considered to be the main neurotransmitter in these inhibitory interneurons. our results as well as others show that gaba is present in a subset of hcs  <cit> . we compared gaba labelling in hcs from st <dig> , p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> chicks. at st <dig>  and p <dig>  gaba labelling was uniform in both lim1+ and isl1+ hcs  while at p <dig>  a difference was notable . at p <dig> gaba antibodies just weakly labelled lim1+ hcs whereas a subset of lim1-negative hcs was strongly labelled by gaba . in summary, gaba levels gradually change in two of the subtypes after hatching with high levels remaining in stellate isl1+ hcs, whereas gaba-levels in axon-bearing hcs decrease.

horizontal cell subtype population sizes
horizontal cells from newly hatched p <dig> chick retinas were labelled using combinations of antibodies directed against lim <dig>  isl <dig>  ap2α, prox <dig>  pax <dig>  gaba, calretinin and trka. all markers except isl <dig> and ap2α are previously well established hc markers  <cit> . in the p <dig> chick retina, prox <dig> and pax <dig> antibodies labelled all hcs. consistent with their expression at st <dig>  lim <dig> and isl <dig> did not overlap . lim <dig> and isl <dig> were found in fractions of prox <dig>  pax <dig> and gaba labelled hcs . calretinin was exclusively expressed in lim1+ hcs  and trka was expressed in a fraction of isl1+ hcs . gaba and trka labelling did not overlap . ap2α was expressed in all axon-bearing and some axon-less hcs . at p <dig>  ap2α was expressed in the majority of gabaergic hcs , in all calretinin+ hcs , but not in trka+ hcs .

we quantified the fractions of cells single- or double-positive for these markers in the central retina , and found that at p <dig>  50% of all hcs expressed either lim <dig> or isl <dig>  ap2α was expressed in 56% of all hcs, and gaba and trka was expressed by 60% and 40% of all hcs, respectively . about 20% of the axon-less  hcs were labelled for gaba, and the remaining isl1+ cells for trka . of all hcs expressing gaba at p <dig>  80% were axon-bearing  hcs, whereas the remaining 20% were of the axon-less stellate hc type . quantification with respect to calretinin confirmed the previous observations of calretinin expression in axon-bearing hcs .

our data reveal the existence of two complementary divisions of the hc population where lim <dig> and isl <dig> split the hc population 50/ <dig>  and gaba and trka split the population 60/ <dig>  combined, these divide the hc population into three distinct groups where axon-bearing lim1+ hcs constitute 50%, axon-less stellate hcs expressing isl <dig> and gaba constitute 10% and axon-less candelabrum hcs expressing isl <dig> and trka constitute 40% of the hc population .

apoptosis does not affect the prox1+ hc population
to investigate whether apoptosis sculpted the relative proportions of hc subtypes during early retinal development, we performed tunel staining combined with prox <dig> antibody labelling in all developmental stages ranging from st <dig> to st <dig> as well as in selected later embryonic and post-hatch stages. we were unable to detect tunel stained prox1+ cells in any of the early stages we investigated . at later retinal stages, a double-stained cell could occasionally be found in the extreme peripheral retina, but not in the early developing retina nor in the central retina. tunel and isl1+ double-labelled cells belonging to other neuronal populations were observed .

the onset of lim <dig> expression is preceded by a drastic wave-like decrease of endogenous follistatin expression
previous results have shown that over-expression of follistatin in the developing retina results in ectopic cells expressing prox <dig>  <cit> . this observation prompted us to further investigate the hc generation with respect to follistatin. we analyzed the follistatin mrna expression in total retina from st <dig> to st <dig> embryos using qrt-pcr. the levels were normalized to the house-keeping genes β-actin and tata-box binding protein. by far, the highest levels of follistatin mrna were in the optic cup and early eye . the mrna levels dropped sharply until reaching relatively very low levels between st <dig> and st <dig> . the levels increased again after st <dig>  for comparison we analyzed the related factor follistatin-like  <dig>  which in contrast to follistatin was not developmentally regulated . the drop in follistatin mrna levels between stages  <dig> and  <dig>  coincides with the birth of lim1+ hcs .

lim <dig> expression commences in the central retina at st19- <dig>  <cit>  and extends peripherally as development progresses. at the early developmental stages, follistatin immunoreactivity was strong in retina, lens and pigment epithelium. with increasing age, a central to peripheral gradient of different strengths of follistatin immunoreactivity in the retina became progressively more obvious, with the strongest immunoreactivity levels located in the periphery . the onset of lim <dig> expression followed close behind the decrease of follistatin immunoreactivity as it moved towards the periphery . as development progressed , the endogenous expression of follistatin in the central retina became restricted to cells located in the putative gcl, whereas the expression in the central-outer retina gradually waned . by st <dig> , follistatin immunoreactivity was restricted to the gcl and to cells located on the inner rim of the inl .

injection of follistatin at e <dig> decreases the number of newly generated lim1+ cells
as retinal development progressed in a central to peripheral fashion, we observed that decreasing levels of follistatin immunoreactivity preceded the onset and expansion of lim <dig> expression. this inverse correlation between hc generation and high follistatin levels suggested that follistatin overexposure may interfere with the generation of lim1+ cells. we injected st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> embryos with follistatin or vehicle and analysed the number of lim1+ cells in the central retina  <dig> h after the injection. the follistatin bolus injection caused a significant 20–25% reduction in the number of lim1+ cells per mm <dig> retina in all stages tested .

the main target for the inhibitory action of follistatin is activin  <cit> , which is expressed in the developing retina  <cit>  and is known to decrease cell proliferation in many cell types and tissues  <cit> . we therefore hypothesised that the reduction of newly generated lim1+ cells by the added follistatin, was an effect on the lim1-generating progenitor cells. the inhibitory action of follistatin would then keep the progenitor cells proliferating and thus delaying cells from exiting the cell cycle and turning on lim <dig> expression. this would lead to fewer newly generated lim1+ cells compared to controls. to test this we added brdu  <dig> h after either follistatin or activin injections to mark cells passing through s-phase. the number of brdu cells was analyzed after a total of  <dig> h. the activin injections caused a robust decrease in brdu incorporation compared to controls  while the follistatin injections did not lead to any conclusive changes . this indicates that activin treatment caused either an overall decreased proliferation rate or caused retinal progenitor cells  to undergo premature cell cycle withdrawal. this finding indirectly support the hypothesis that the bolus dose of follistatin delays the onset of lim <dig> expression by keeping progenitor cells in a proliferative state.

injection of follistatin at e <dig> affects retinal histology at e9
effects on hcs can definitely be monitored first at st <dig> , the time when both lim1+ and isl1+ hcs have migrated to the hcl. we performed a series of injections of follistatin into eyes of embryos ranging from st18- <dig>  analyses of prox <dig>  lim <dig> and isl <dig> immunoreactivity were then carried out at st <dig> . we found that the structure of the inner plexiform layer was frequently distorted in embryos injected at early stages up to st <dig>  but that no obvious phenotype could be observed from st <dig> and beyond . the typical follistatin-histology in our experiment at st <dig> is consistent with moreira and adler's observations  <cit> , and was characterized by a thinner inner plexiform layer  and ectopic prox1+ cells either scattered or arranged in columns spanning the gcl and/or inl . this phenotype served as our criterion to determine if a retinal region had been affected by follistatin, and images from such regions were acquired and used for further analysis.

follistatin produces ectopic horizontal cells that migrate back to the hcl
the expression of prox <dig>  although at ectopic locations in the st <dig>  retina, hinted that the cells were hcs. we wanted to know whether the ectopic prox1+ cells were in fact hcs and investigated if they in addition to prox <dig> expressed lim <dig> or isl <dig>  embryos were analysed with respect to hc development at st <dig>  some of the retinas were analysed one day later at st <dig> . this relatively long post-injection time of 6– <dig> days was chosen in order to ensure the correct identification and quantification of hc subtypes, based both on their marker expression and localization in the retina.

double immunohistochemistry for prox <dig>  lim <dig> and isl <dig>  showed that the ectopic prox <dig> cells seen at st <dig> expressed either lim <dig> or isl <dig>  indicating that ectopic prox1+ cells were bona fide hcs. consistent with our previous results, we did not observe lim <dig> and isl <dig> co-expression in control or follistatin-treated retinas . the ectopic cells in the st <dig> retina were predominantly of the prox <dig>  isl <dig> double positive hc subtype  and only a fraction of the ectopic prox1+ cells expressed lim <dig> . one day later at st36/e <dig>  ectopic hcs could not be found . since the total number of cells double-positive for prox <dig> and lim <dig> or prox <dig> and isl <dig>  were similar in st <dig> and st <dig> retinas , and apoptosis was not detected in normal or ectopic prox1+ cells as shown by tunel , it was concluded that the st <dig> ectopic hcs had migrated back to the hcl at st <dig>  following a normal although delayed migration route.

injections of follistatin at e <dig> increase the number of hcs at e9
when analysing regions containing ectopic prox1+ cells it appeared as if the number of prox1+ hcs had increased. this was in contrast to the results obtained for lim1+ cells  <dig> h after follistatin administration. we injected follistatin in a series of embryos at the phase of hc generation. as shown by the hc birth-dating experiments , st <dig> and st <dig> correspond to the initial phases of the generation of the two hcs populations, respectively. this period also corresponds to when the endogenous follistatin levels drop . controls were injected with vehicle at st <dig> or st <dig>  we counted cells double-positive for prox <dig> and lim <dig>  and prox <dig> and isl <dig> at st <dig>  in retinas treated with follistatin at st <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or st <dig> and each stage was then compared individually with controls treated with vehicle at st <dig> or st <dig> 

if the st <dig> treatment preferentially had effects on the early lim <dig> population and not on the later isl <dig> population, while the st <dig> treatment had effects on the late population, it could be hypothesized that the lim <dig> and isl <dig> hc subtypes are generated from separate progenitor cells. conversely, if the early follistatin treatment also had effects on the late population it is likely that both subtypes are generated from a common pool of progenitor cells that is affected by the follistatin inhibition and expanded.

we found that follistatin treatment at all  <dig> stages caused a significant increase in the total number of hcs  as well as significant increases in both the number of lim1+ and isl1+ hc subtypes compared to controls . with respect to the number of lim1+ or isl1+ cells in follistatin-treated animals, we found no difference between the early and late injection stages . over all, the increase in the total number of prox1+ cells was approximately 30%, for lim <dig>  prox <dig> double positive cells approximately 40%, and for isl <dig>  prox <dig> double positive cells approximately 50% . thus, our data showed that follistatin overexposure at st <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or st <dig> caused an over-production of both the lim1+ and the isl1+ hc subtypes when analyzed at st <dig>  regardless of the stage of treatment.

follistatin treatment and the effects on other retinal cell types
we analysed whether follistatin treatment at st <dig> influenced the generation of cell types other than hcs by quantifying the number of cells carrying markers against photoreceptors , amacrine cells , bipolar cells  and ganglion cells  in st <dig> retinas  <cit> . we did not detect any differences in the number of immunoreactive cells in the outer nuclear layer after follistatin treatment using lim <dig>  or isl1/ <dig> antibodies . the cells in the outer nuclear layer labelled by the isl1/ <dig> antibody most likely correspond to isl2+ cells, since labelling with another isl <dig> specific antibody did not produce immunoreactivity in these cells . in the inl, the bipolar cell population marked by lim <dig> and isl <dig> , and the amacrine cell population marked by ap2α  were not affected by the follistatin treatment . in the gcl we did not detect any significant differences in the number of isl1+ cells compared to controls . noteworthy is that due to loss of inner plexiform layer thickness following follistatin treatment, we could not distinguish isl1+ ganglion cells from isl1+ amacrine cells normally present in the inner nuclear- and plexiform layers . therefore, the isl <dig> cell-counts in figure 9i include both these cell types. these data are also summarized in additional file  <dig>  these data suggest that under these experimental conditions, hcs is the only cell type that is affected by the follistatin treatment at st <dig> 

discussion
horizontal cell subtypes and their maturation
in this work we have demonstrated that hcs are generated as two equally large and distinct subgroups during early retinogenesis. one subgroup, corresponding to the axon-bearing hc, expresses lim <dig> whereas the other subgroup, corresponding to the axon-less hcs, expresses isl <dig>  the axon-less  hc subpopulation can be further subdivided in two hc subtypes. the lim <dig> and isl <dig> hc subgroups are generated and then migrate bi-directionally in the developing retina during successive periods. moreover, we show that retinal progenitor cells that are able to generate both lim <dig> and isl <dig> hcs respond to follistatin overexposure at e <dig>  the treatment results in significant increases in both lim <dig> and isl <dig> hc subtypes at e <dig>  this effect is specific to hcs, and is best explained by a sustained proliferation of hc-generating progenitor cells.

we have demonstrated two types of axon-less hcs, the stellate and candelabrum-shaped hcs that in addition to isl <dig>  express gaba and trka, respectively. the axon-bearing brush-shaped hcs express calretinin in addition to lim <dig>  we quantified the proportions of the hc subtypes in the central p <dig> chick retina and found that the axon-bearing brush-shaped hc and the axon-less stellate and candelabrum-shaped hcs constituted 50%, 10% and 40% of the hc population, respectively. these findings are consistent with previous reports on chick hcs  <cit> . however, in slight contrast to our findings one recent report demonstrated that in p7–p <dig> chick retina a small fraction of isl1+ hcs express calretinin  <cit> , an observation that is not supported by our p <dig> retinal preparations and it is therefore possible that a subset of isl1+ hcs turn on calretinin expression after hatching. the same study also identified what was classified as a fourth hc subtype based on their analysis of hc markers. a fourth hc subtype is also described in the pigeon retina based on morphological criteria  <cit> . our results support the classical division of chick hcs into three main subtypes  <cit>  but the actual number and extent of heterogeneity in hc subtypes in the chick retina is an unsettled issue.

as the retina undergoes late maturation, synapse rearrangement and changes in the expression levels of various proteins are known to occur  <cit> . we found that gaba was initially present uniformly in all gaba-containing hcs, but that gaba levels progressively decreased in axon-bearing hcs and increased in axon-less stellate hcs after hatch. this implies that gaba has a role in adult stellate hcs but not in adult axon-bearing cells. rather, gaba may have a transient function in the developing axon-bearing hcs. this is in agreement with a role for gaba during synapse maturation when connections between hcs and photoreceptors or bipolar cells are established  <cit> . other studies have reported changes in gaba levels during phenotypic maturation of hcs in rats, rabbits, guinea pigs and humans  <cit> .

early development of hc subtypes
most classes of retinal neurons undergo cell death during development  <cit> . photoreceptors and hcs are likely exceptions to this rule  <cit>  and it has been shown that hcs do not undergo apoptosis during later stages of development  <cit> . we investigated apoptosis in hcs using tunel during early  and late retinal development , but could not find evidence to suggest that the hc population size was adjusted by apoptosis. moreover, lim1+ hcs have been shown to migrate bi-directionally across the retina  <cit>  and in this study we show that the prox <dig>  isl <dig> double positive hcs followed a similar but delayed pattern, migrating approximately one day later . hence, we concluded that isl1+ hcs also undergo bi-directional migration.

we investigated whether the two hc subpopulations marked by lim <dig> or isl <dig> were born simultaneously or consecutively by performing a birth-dating analysis using -dt incorporation. our results revealed that although the two birth-curves overlapped, the majority of lim1+ hcs were born between e <dig> and e <dig> whereas the majority of the hcs expressing isl1+ were born between e <dig> and e <dig> . however, since the earliest stage when isl1+ hcs can be positively identified using prox <dig> is st <dig> , the lack of earlier hc subtype markers makes it difficult to state with certainty that hc progenitors that give rise to the isl1+ hcs are in fact born into an isl1-fate . however, the birth-curve of the isl1+ hcs is concomitant with the appearance of prox1+, lim1-negative cells in the retina between e <dig>  and e <dig>  <cit> . these prox1-single positive cells likely correspond to the isl1+ hc fraction before the actual onset of isl <dig> expression. thus, the birth-dating results inferring that isl1+ hcs undergo their last s-phase around e4– <dig>  which is just prior to the appearance of prox1-single positive cells at e <dig> , supports a scenario where the late hc subgroup identity is established at the time of cell cycle withdrawal. in addition, we do not find any isl <dig> and lim <dig> double labelling in hcs  after st <dig>  godinho et al recently used live imaging in the zebrafish retina to show that the mitoses generating hcs occurred in the inl  <cit> . combined, these data opens up the possibility that hcs in chick are generated as cells committed into distinct fates , and that the generation of these subgroups is temporally separated.

the results from a recent lineage study of chick hcs suggested that there was no significant difference in the birth order among three identified hc subtypes  <cit> . our birth-dating experiment only considered hcs in the very central part of the retina and as the generation of hcs proceed further peripherally in the retina the temporal overlap of the generation may be larger. this may explain the discrepancy between the different results. in addition, the two waves of migration to the hcl also imply a consecutive generation of the subtypes.

the separate birth-dates and migration periods reveal the existence of temporal windows during which hc precursors can acquire different fates. for instance, the generation of stellate hcs could result from a combination of instructive signals acting at overlapping time points. stellate hcs could be generated during an overlap of: a) a decreasing signal instructing early born hcs to express ap2α and gaba, and b) an increasing signal instructing late-born hcs to express isl <dig>  the 6–10% abundance of ap2α and gaba expression in the stellate hcs may suggest such a mechanism . in this scenario, later born isl1+ hcs  would encounter only the second signal and develop along a third route. these potential signals remain to be characterized and may be either extrinsic, intrinsic or both. the signals seem not to be of a character that could be inhibited by follistatin since the subpopulations were not differentially affected by this treatment.

follistatin promotes the proliferation of hc-generating progenitor cells
in the developing retina extrinsic signals, exemplified by the tgfβ/bmp family members, are suggested to regulate nearly every aspect of retinal development, such as proliferation, migration, fate determination, cell death and functional maturation  <cit> . follistatin, a potent inhibitor of activin and several other members of the tgfβ super family have previously been implicated to take part in the differentiation of retinal neurons  <cit> . for instance, a recent study indicated that follistatin could interfere with the generation of neurons in the developing retina, and also showed that follistatin was able to down-regulate the activin-dependent psmad <dig>  <cit> .

the central-to-peripheral temporal gradient of retinal development, where the central regions of the retina are more mature relative the peripherally located regions, is well characterized and makes the spatio-temporal aspect of retinal development an important factor to consider. therefore, to understand how follistatin activity in the retina relates to our birth-dating of hcs as well as to the appearance of the early hc marker lim <dig>  we characterized the spatio-temporal follistatin expression. we found that follistatin expression followed a central-to-peripheral pattern and that with increasing age the immunoreactivity in the central retina decreased and an apparent wave-front of high follistatin expression moved towards to the periphery. the appearance of lim1+ cells followed close behind this moving wave-front . combined with our qrt-pcr data demonstrating a dramatic 50-fold drop in follistatin mrna levels that coincided with the time of hc birth, our observations show a correlation between low follistatin levels and hc generation.

in several cells and tissues, follistatin promotes proliferation by removing the inhibition of cell proliferation exerted by activin  <cit> . our observations indicate that this is also true in the developing retina. for instance, activin injections in e <dig> embryos caused a robust decrease in brdu incorporation , and during e <dig> , which is a time marked by massive rpc proliferation in the developing retina, the relative levels of follistatin mrna were extremely high . combined, these observations indicate that follistatin stimulate proliferation in the retina, possibly by repressing activin signalling. interestingly, the notion that follistatin stimulates proliferation may appear inconsistent with the observation that embryos injected with follistatin and analysed  <dig> h after the injection had fewer lim1+ cells than control-treated embryos. our interpretation is that the transient follistatin overexposure prevents hc-generating progenitor cells from producing post-mitotic cells, which turn on lim <dig> expression. instead, the affected progenitor cells may produce two mitotic daughters  that will both inherit the capability to produce hcs. thus, with a follistatin-induced increase of the hc-generating progenitor pool, the observed result will be a delayed onset of lim <dig> expression, followed by an increase in the total number of hcs at a later time point , and this is what our results showed. combined, these observations suggest that follistatin is important for early rpc proliferation in general and specifically for the proliferation and generation of hc progenitor/precursor cells . however, since the follistatin-phenotype at e <dig>  most often was restricted to distinct regions of the retina, this indicates the existence of a spatio-temporal window during which hc-generating progenitor cells are susceptible to follistatin treatment which give rise to the described effects.

moreover, embryos injected with follistatin at e <dig> and analysed at e <dig>  had a significantly increased number of hcs. this increase was slightly more pronounced in the later-born isl1+ hcs  compared to the early lim1+ hcs  . furthermore, the ectopic hcs scattered within the retina at st <dig> in follistatin-treated retinas were predominantly of the isl <dig> subtype . one day later, at st <dig>  these ectopic cells were no longer observed and we concluded that they had settled in the hcl , since the increased number of prox <dig>  isl <dig> double positive hcs was similar in st <dig> and st <dig> retinas. moreover, tunel staining was not detected in these cells . our conclusion is that the ectopic and migrating hcs at st <dig> represent hcs that were produced in excess following follistatin treatment. this is in agreement with a model wherein follistatin cause hc-generating progenitor cells to proliferate beyond the normal period of hc generation, thus producing extra hcs that also migrate to the hcl.

follistatin inhibits the action of ligands such as activin and other tgfβ-signalling molecules by binding them and thus preventing subsequent receptor activation. hence, the inhibitory effects of follistatin depend on the presence of these ligands. activin and its receptors are known to be present in the developing retina  <cit>  and therefore activin stands out as a likely candidate through which follistatin exerts its inhibitory action. however, it cannot be excluded that the effects caused by follistatin treatment are generated by the inhibition of other tgfβ-signalling systems, or that the follistatin treatment may mediate its effects by indirectly influencing other cell signalling systems. regardless of the pathway by which follistatin affects retinal development at e <dig>  our data suggest that the effects are exclusive to progenitor cells that generate hcs since we were unable to detect any differences in the number of other retinal cell populations at e <dig> following follistatin treatment at st <dig> . this was perhaps surprising, considering the broad spectrum of ligands which follistatin can bind and inhibit, and also considering that classic lineage-tracing experiments have shown that early rpcs are homogeneously multipotent and capable of generating all retinal cell types  <cit> .

the result that the other major retinal cell populations studied were not affected by follistatin might, however, be explained by one or more mechanisms. first, compared to hcs, most retinal cell populations are generated over a long period of time, which allows for secondary mechanisms to control proliferation and cell-fate decisions. this can be exemplified by post-mitotic amacrine cells and ganglion cells that through feedback inhibition to progenitor cells control the continued generation of these cell types, respectively  <cit> . in addition, apoptosis may also provide a mechanism by which, from e <dig> to e <dig>  cell numbers are adjusted and corrected. secondly, the brief overexposure-time of follistatin in our experimental setup may be insufficient to produce effects that would require long-term follistatin exposure, and may explain the inconsistency between our and moreira and adler's observations that following their continuous follistatin-overexposure, the region containing ap2α amacrine cells decreased in thickness  <cit> . thirdly, one may hypothesise that progenitor cells, which generate other retinal populations than hcs at e <dig> , rely on other signalling systems than follistatin to control their proliferation rate. supporting this view are previous studies reporting that certain rpcs are biased to produce only a limited repertoire of neurons  <cit> . these three explanations are not mutually exclusive; however, based on our and other's data, we favour an explanation that assumes a degree of heterogeneity in the early rpc pool.

horizontal cells are in several ways the odd ones out when compared to other retinal neurons. for example, hcs undergo bi-directional migration, and in contrast to most retinal cell populations, hc cell numbers are not adjusted by apoptosis, neither during early nor late development. as shown here, hcs are the only cell type that is affected by follistatin at e <dig>  which suggests that progenitor cells that are competent to generate hcs are follistatin-sensitive, whereas progenitor cells that generate other early-born neurons, e.g. cone photoreceptors are not. in line with this, the existence of progenitor cells biased for hc generation have been indicated in mice  <cit>  where zhang et al. found using cre-loxp fate-mapping that an enhancer element of pax <dig> was active in a restricted subset of rpcs, which almost exclusively generated hcs. the recent work by godinho et al in zebrafish  <cit>  and the lineage study in chick by rompani and cepko  <cit>  both shows that there are progenitor cells fated to generate hcs by a final mitosis. rompani and cepko's data suggest that such dedicated hc progenitors are biased to generate two hcs of only one subtype.

our results showed that the generation of both lim1+ and isl1+ subtypes were affected by the follistatin injections at st20- <dig> . assuming that the effect by the early bolus injection of follistatin is transient and that it is washed out before the peak of isl1+ hc generation, our data agree with an interpretation that progenitors are committed to a hc fate before their terminal mitosis or even before they undergo their last s-phase. this interpretation is consistent with the observation that pre-mitotic hc precursors in zebrafish bear morphological resemblance to hcs themselves and also express ptf1a and cx <dig>  that are normally found in post-mitotic hcs  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
axon-bearing and axon-less hc subtypes express lim <dig> and isl <dig>  respectively. these two subtypes are born sequentially and their relative proportions are fixed early in development and are not adjusted by apoptosis. hcs are generated concomitantly with a decrease in endogenous follistatin levels. adding exogenous follistatin at e <dig> clearly affected progenitor cells competent to generate hcs, and caused an over-production of hcs . taken together, our data suggest that hc progenitors are sensitive to follistatin and become committed to produce lim1+ and/or isl1+ hc subtypes concomitantly with or early after their own generation.
