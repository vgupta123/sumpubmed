BACKGROUND
in spite of the increasing social pressure against it, surgical castration is still commonly performed to eliminate boar taint in male slaughter pigs. however, entire male pigs show better feed consumption, leaner meat percentage and better carcass traits than barrows and are more profitable for swine producers . an alternative to castration would therefore be highly advantageous for pig breeders worldwide. boar taint is a characteristic and unpleasant odor and flavor noticeable when cooking meat from some uncastrated male pigs. the taint has been described as being akin to urine and manure  <cit>  and is mainly caused by high levels of androstenone, skatole and/or indole in adipose tissue. the incidence of tainted carcasses varies considerably between breeds and the contribution of androstenone and skatole to boar taint has also been shown to be very different among breeds . heritability of androstenone is high, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> . androstenone is a natural steroid produced by the leydig cells of the testis along with other sex steroids like estrogens and testosterone  <cit> , but it is subsequently concentrated and converted in the salivary gland to an active sex pheromone. while estrogens are well known as important female sex hormones, they are also important controllers for the normal function of the adult male reproductive tract and male fertility  and serve as indicator of sexual maturity status in boars  <cit> . therefore to identify genomic regions simultaneously affecting levels of boar taint and fertility related compounds, the sex hormones 17β-estradiol , estrone sulphate  and testosterone   were included. two other compounds, skatole and indole, are produced from the amino acid tryptophan in the colon and are absorbed into the blood stream before being degraded in the liver  <cit> . while indole is thought to be less important with regards to boar taint  <cit> , skatole is found to have a strong faecal and naphthalene taste and odor  <cit> . skatole is shown to have medium/high heritability  in norwegian landrace and duroc  <cit> . levels of skatole are affected by feeding and recently rasmussen et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that feed containing chicory root could impact the activity of enzymes involved in skatole metabolism.

genome scans have been performed for androstenone and skatole in a variety of pig breeds  <cit> , however results have been inconsistent. recent developments in high-throughput genotyping technologies and efficient methods for snp-discovery using next-generation sequencing technologies have paved the way to create efficient tools for qtl mapping by genome-wide association. a high-density porcine snp array containing more than  <dig>  snps has been developed  <cit> , which offers a much higher resolution compared to the previously available porcine snp chip  <cit>  used in our populations  <cit> . the aim of this study was to perform a high-density genome wide association  in combination with linkage disequilibrium-linkage analysis  using the  <dig> k snp chip to identify the genomic regions influencing the boar taint compounds androstenone, skatole and indole, as well as the fertility related compounds 17β-estradiol, estron sulphate and testosterone in the two commercial breeds duroc and landrace. additionally, differentially expressed genes within the qtl regions were detected by combining the current results with the results from moe et al.  <cit>  and  <cit> . this identifies genes located within the target regions providing both transcriptional and positional candidate genes for the qtl.

methods
animals and phenotypes
in total, data from  <dig>  purebred norwegian landrace and  <dig> purebred duroc male pigs tested in norsvin's three boar testing stations were included in this study. this includes  <dig> half sib families with  <dig> to  <dig> offspring for landrace and  <dig> half sib families with  <dig> to  <dig> offspring for duroc. pedigree information, including six generations of parents, was available for all individuals. animals were reared under similar conditions using standard commercial feed, and were sacrificed over a period of  <dig> months. on average, landrace and duroc boars reached slaughter weight  at  <dig> and  <dig> days respectively, and were slaughtered in average  <dig> days later. the reason for this is that we had to wait for final ebv estimation and selection of the ai boars. blood samples were collected immediately before slaughter for plasma suspension and dna extraction, while subcutaneous adipose tissue samples for androstenone measurement were collected from the neck at slaughter line . all animals were cared for according to laws, internationally recognized guidelines and regulations controlling experiments with live animals in norway ; according to the rules given by norwegian animal research authority.

levels of androstenone were measured in both subcutaneous fat and plasma and in both cases the concentration of androstenone  was determined using a modified time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay  <cit> , employing an antibody produced by andresen  <cit> . skatole and indole levels in adipose tissue were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography  <cit> . plasma levels of testosterone were measured using a radioimmunoassay  and displayed intra- and total-assay coefficients of variation  were 7% and 9%, respectively. plasma levels of 17β-estradiol were measured using a fluoroimmunoassay  producing intra- and total-assay cvs of 3% and 7%, respectively. plasma levels of estrone sulphate were measured with a radioimmunoassay  producing intra- and total-assay cvs of 5% and 7%, respectively. all chemical compounds are reported in parts-per-million . all the phenotypic data were log-transformed in order to make them approximately normally distributed.

dna extraction, genotyping, quality control and map construction
dna was extracted from porcine blood, leukocytes or semen using the magattract dna blood midi m <dig> protocol on the bio-robot m <dig> . dna concentration and quality were assessed using a nanodrop nd- <dig> spectrophotometer  and a victor <dig> multilabel counter  using picogreen reagent . the dna quality was considered to be acceptable with lower and upper limits of  <dig> and  <dig> ng/μl, respectively, and with 260: <dig> and 260: <dig> ratios around  <dig> . thereafter samples were normalized to  <dig> ng/μl in 96-well plates. genotyping of the  <dig> k porcine snp array was performed using the iscan platform  according to manufacturer's instructions. clustering and genotype calling were performed using the genotyping module in the genome studio software . in total, the  <dig>  landrace and  <dig> duroc boars were genotyped for  <dig>  snps. genotypes were included in analysis if snp markers passed a quality threshold of having a minor allele frequency  >  <dig> , call frequency >  <dig> , and parent-child mendelian errors <  <dig> . samples were included in analysis if their call rate was > 75%, although the average call rate was  <dig> % with a standard deviation of  <dig> %. based on data from a previous study, samples from animals displaying excessive pedigree errors were not included in this analysis. after quality control  <dig>  boars and  <dig> sires were available for analysis in landrace together with  <dig> boars and  <dig> sires in duroc. in total  <dig>  snp markers  passed the quality threshold filtering. due to being non-informative  <dig> snps were removed. additionally,  <dig> snps were removed since they were not able to place on any of the chromosomes using two-point analysis in a modified version of the crimap software package  <cit> . the order of markers was determined based on the porcine sequence build  <dig>  followed by multipoint linkage analyses using crimap  <cit> . recombination units were then transformed to map distances using the haldane mapping function, and the suggested positions from sscrofa <dig> were modified if required. in total  <dig>  of the high quality snp markers were placed on chromosomal locations on sscrofa <dig>   <dig>  on the landrace map and  <dig>  on the duroc map. number of snp markers per chromosome and length of the chromosomes  are shown in additional file  <dig> 

statistical analyses
statistical analyses were performed separately for the two breeds. preliminary estimates of the phenotypes were found to have a skewed distribution and were consequently log-transformed. furthermore some animals had phenotypic levels below the detection limits of the chemo analytical methods used and were recorded as zero. to avoid losing information caused by log-transformation, the detection limits were added to all phenotypes before transformation. the detection limits were  <dig>  ppm for androstenone,  <dig>  ppm for skatole and indole,  <dig>  ppm for testosterone and estron sulphate, and  <dig>  ppm for 17β-estradiol. gwa is considered to be more powerful than linkage analysis for detecting the effects of common alleles with small effects but is less powerful when traits have a complex genetic determination, including epistasis. the gwa method uses linkage disequilibrium information and assumes all markers to be independent of each other, thereby ignoring genetic linkage between markers. gwa is expected to reveal more false positive results because single marker linkage disequilibria are very variable. therefore, the data was simultaneously analyzed with ldla, combining the linkage disequilibrium and linkage analysis  <cit> .

genome-wide association study 
a gwas was conducted using a statistical model including fixed effect corrections for; test-station, age at entering the test, number of days in test, number of litter mates born alive, and the random effects; a polygenic effect and an additive snp effect. the polygenic effect was included to account for the family structure that was present in the data and was assumed to have a covariance matrix proportional to the pedigree based relationship matrix. the additive snp effect was also assumed a random effect, and was obtained by regressing the phenotypes on to the number of '1' alleles in the snp genotypes, i.e. for the snp genotypes ' <dig> 0', ' <dig> 1', and ' <dig> 1' the covariate of the regression was  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, where arbitrarily one of the snp alleles is called '1' and the other '0'.

a log-likelihood ratio test-statistic was calculated as lnlikratio = lnlikmodel incl. snp - lnlikmodel excl. snp, where lnlikmodel incl. snp is the reml log-likelihood  <cit>  of the model describe above and lnlikmodel excl. snp is the reml log-likelihood of the same model, except that the snp effect was excluded from the analysis. under the null-hypothesis of no snp effect, 2*lnlikratio was assumed to follow a chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom. chromosome-wide p-values  were obtained using the approach described by piepho  <cit> . genome-wide p-values  were obtained by multiplying the cws by  <dig>  i.e. by the number of porcine autosomal chromosomes analyzed. we considered the snp/qtl as significant if p <  <dig> .

linkage disequilibrium/linkage analysis 
the statistical model used for the combined linkage disequilibrium and linkage analysis  was identical to that of gwas except that a haplotype effect was fitted instead of a snp effect. ldla followed approximately the approach of meuwissen and goddard  <cit> , except that haplotypes were either assumed to be completely correlated or uncorrelated, instead of fitting a more differentiating ibd matrix g. based on experiences with ibd matrix calculations it was decided that if the sum of the number of identical snp alleles equal to the left and to the right of the putative qtl position before a non-equal allele occurred was ≥  <dig>  then a haplotype pair was considered identical. otherwise, the two haplotypes were considered to be different, and uncorrelated. lnlikratio, cws and gws were calculated in the same way as for gwas.

candidate genes and differential expressed genes within qtl regions
candidate genes within the qtl regions were detected using the porcine ensembl data base  . in order to obtain additional candidate genes in comparative genomic regions the ucsc genome browser  and the ncbi database  were applied. to find differentially expressed genes within the significant qtl regions, the results from the current qtl study was compared with the significant differentially expressed genes obtained using the same animal material  <cit> . the results were imported and combined in r v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit> .

RESULTS
descriptive data  for this animal material have been presented earlier by grindflek et al.  <cit> . here we present qtl results from the seven traits; androstenone in subcutaneous fat , androstenone in plasma , skatole , indole , testosterone , 17β-estradiol  and estronsulphate .

androstenone and other sex steroids
according to the threshold values described in material and methods we detected  <dig> gws qtl regions for androf in landrace, and  <dig> gws qtl regions in duroc using ldla. seven of these qtl regions were detected in both breeds, in every case they were significant  at the gws level in one breed and at least cws in the other . the common qtls were located at ssc  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  results from the gwas revealed  <dig> qtl regions for androf that were gws in landrace,  <dig> of these were located within qtl regions detected by ldla. in duroc,  <dig> qtls were detected with gwas,  <dig> falling within qtl regions identified with ldla. for androp,  <dig> and  <dig> gws qtls were detected in landrace and duroc  using ldla , with  <dig> and  <dig> of them confirmed using gwas, respectively . when comparing the qtl regions detected by ldla, we found that  <dig> qtls are significant for both androf and androp in landrace, and  <dig> in duroc. comparing qtl regions at the cws level, a greater number of qtl regions are shared between the androf and androp. all  <dig> gws androf qtls in landrace are also affecting ediol and/or esulph on at least a cws level. in duroc,  <dig> of  <dig> qtls are affecting androf without at least cws affecting any of the other estrogens. only  <dig> gws qtls were detected for testo , however these were very convincingly obtained in both breeds using both ldla and gwas. for ediol,  <dig> gws qtls were obtained in the ldla for landrace and  <dig> for duroc, with the common qtls between breeds located on ssc  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  qtl regions for esulph were generally similar to those detected for ediol. for landrace,  <dig> of the  <dig> qtls obtained in ediol were also at least cws in esulph. notably however, a convincing qtl on ssc <dig>  was significant  in esulph only. in duroc all qtls obtained on gws level were in common for ediol and esulph. the fraction of the genetic variance explained by the significant androf qtl regions varies between  <dig> and 6% . the gws qtls for androf obtained by ldla are listed in table  <dig>  the log-ratio plots from gwas results androf, testo, ediol and esulph are shown in figure  <dig> and  <dig> for landrace and duroc, respectively. the candidate genes within gws qtl regions for androf are shown in table  <dig> and the differentially expressed genes in high/low androstenone boars located within these qtl regions are shown in table  <dig>

discussion
qtl regions and potential candidate genes
the gws qtls for androstenone and skatole obtained by ldla are divided into the different chromosomes and discussed below. we chose to focus on the ldla results since this method is considered to be most robust. moreover, the ldla likelihood profiles were smoother than those from gwa which facilitated the positioning of the qtls. the qtls detected by ldla are, however, highly supported by the gwas results obtained in the study . candidate genes located within qtl regions and discussed in the paper are all listed with the full name in table  <dig> 

ssc1
androstenone
four putative qtls were detected for androf in landrace and/or duroc on ssc <dig> . recently on ssc <dig>  three qtls were also detected in a dutch composite duroc-line  <cit>  and three qtls in french large white  <cit> , but all in different regions. no obvious candidate genes were observed in any of the regions detected in our study, however a non-annotated gene transcript  located within qtl1a was previously found to be differentially expressed in duroc boars with extreme high/low androstenone levels, and the gene gpd1l located within qtl1c was up-regulated in high androstenone landrace boars  <cit>  .

skatole
one putative qtl for skatole was detected on ssc <dig> position  <dig> - <dig>  mb . this qtl did not overlap with either of the two recently detected qtl positions on ssc <dig> for skatole in french large white  <cit> . the peak positions in french large-white are  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb, quite far from our qtl at 165- <dig> mb, and are most likely two different qtls not segregating in our landrace and duroc populations.

ssc2
two regions on ssc <dig>  are affecting  androf, androp, and one or two of the estrogens in both breeds. qtl2a is additionally cws for testo in landrace. a landrace specific qtl  in region  <dig> - <dig>  mb was found to affect all traits included in this study . our qtl2a concurs with a wide qtl region for androstenone detected between markers sw <dig>  and s <dig>  in a large white × meishan cross  <cit> . a large number of genes are embraced by this region including gas <dig>  which was previously found to be differentially expressed in testis from landrace boars with extreme high/low levels of androstenone  <cit> . one obvious candidate in the region is the cyp2r <dig> gene  which encodes a member of the cytochrome p <dig> superfamily of enzymes known to catalyze many reactions involved in synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids . no qtls for androstenone have previously been reported close to our qtl2b. despite qtl2b presenting a narrow qtl region we found several candidate genes that may be involved in processes of androstenone metabolism. one of them is the stard <dig> gene which plays an important role as a directional cholesterol transporter in the maintenance of cellular cholesterol homeostasis  <cit> , and is required to maintain optimum steroid synthesis  <cit> .

ssc3
in ssc <dig> we obtained two gws qtl regions affecting androf and androp. qtl3a embraces the region  <dig> - <dig>  mb in landrace and 38- <dig> mb in duroc, while qtl3b was detected in landrace only and is positioned around  <dig> mb. support for qtl3a is provided by quintanilla et al.  <cit>  who reported a qtl between the markers sw487-s <dig> affecting androstenone at different ages in a large-white × meishan cross. we found that the qtl3a is also affecting estrogens in both breeds, and that the landrace specific qtl3b affects both testosterone  and estrogens . the genes dci, glis <dig>  tigd <dig>  rab11fip <dig>  narfl, gnptg, il1a and il1r <dig> are all localized within qtl3a  and found to be differentially expressed in testis or liver in high androstenone landrace and/or duroc  <cit> . interestingly, il1a has been found to interact with cyp1a <dig>  <cit> , which is localized within the qtl7b peak . cyp1a <dig> has previously been proposed as a candidate gene for skatole  <cit> , but is also recently shown to be involved in steroidogenesis  <cit> . another candidate in the qtl3a is stard <dig>  which is involved in cellular cholesterol homeostasis  <cit> .

using haploview  <cit>  we detected a highly conserved region  in qtl3a containing an interesting candidate gene uxs <dig> . this gene encodes enzymes catalyzing the formation of progesterone, is involved in the formation of udp-xylose, and influences 3-beta-hydroxy-delta5-steroid dehydrogenase  activity  <cit> . it is well known in the boar taint research that the hsd3b enzymes are essential for the biosynthesis of all active steroid hormones  <cit> . additionally, uxs <dig> is shown to be differentially expressed after induction of anterior pituitary hormone , an important developmental signal that accelerates the appearance of a more mature phenotype in the adrenal glands of young individuals  <cit> .

ssc4
on ssc <dig> a qtl for androf and androp was detected in duroc only at a position around  <dig> mb. this qtl is not affecting any of the other sex hormones and might therefore be very interesting for selection purposes. other qtls have previously been detected on ssc <dig>  although they are all located to other chromosomal positions  <cit> . the decr <dig> gene is located within the narrow qtl position detected in the current study. decr <dig>  a nuclear encoded mitochondrial enzyme that participates in the β-oxidation pathway, has previously been suggested as a candidate involved in several meat quality traits  <cit> . furthermore, the candidate gene calb <dig> , was found to be differentially expressed in testis from duroc with extreme high/low levels of androstenone  <cit> . interestingly, results suggest that calb <dig> is regulated by estrogens  <cit>  and other steroid hormones and is through this probably influencing the sexual development and function  <cit> .

ssc5
androstenone
a highly convincing gws duroc specific qtl for androf was detected on ssc <dig> . comparative genomic alignment to human sequence revealed that the hydroxysteroid  dehydrogenase  <dig> homolog , which is known to be involved in steroid metabolism  <cit> , is expected to be located within this region. additionally, the gene encoding retinol dehydrogenase , which is found to be involved in hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity by recognizing 5alpha-androstan-3alpha, 17beta-diol and androsterone as substrates  <cit> , is expected to be localized within this qtl region. with respect to implementation in breeding schemes, it is very interesting to note that this qtl does not affect any of the other sex related hormones in this study. furthermore, a landrace specific qtl  affecting androf, androp and the other sex hormones was detected in position  <dig> - <dig>  mb. no qtl for androstenone have previously been mapped to ssc <dig> 

skatole
a qtl affecting skat and indo was detected in landrace in the region  <dig> - <dig>  mb . in exactly the same chromosomal region we also obtained gws for androp and ediol, and cws for testo and esulph . this is a rather gene rich region but no obvious candidate genes were found.

ssc6
androstenone
recently, duijvesteijn et al.  <cit>  reported a cluster of  <dig> snps on ssc <dig>  significantly affecting subcutaneous fat androstenone in a dutch duroc sire-line. interestingly, in our study a cws qtl region affecting both androf and androp was detected between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb in duroc, but not in landrace. this qtl does not significantly affect  the other sex hormones included in this study, although the effect on esulph is very close to significant. a large block of strong linkage disequilibrium  was detected between  <dig>  and  <dig> mb in the dutch population  <cit> , which is noted to be a very gene rich region. in our study we also see a highly extended amount of ld on approximately the same level as the dutch study in the region between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb . however, the most significant haplotype in the qtl region,  <dig> snps in complete ld between 38- <dig> mb, are explaining only  <dig> % of the total genetic variation. in our study a duroc specific gws qtl was located in the vicinity of  <dig> mb  which affects androf at gws level and androp, testo, ediol and esulph at cws level.

skatole
a landrace specific qtl for skat and indo was obtained on ssc <dig>  region  <dig> - <dig>  mb , and demonstrated the highest log-ratio found in this study . searching for genes in porcine and comparative human genomes using ensembl failed to reveal any obvious candidates, although several transcription factors are located within this region. interestingly, a qtl for 'sensory panel skatole' has previously been detected in a meishan/large white cross located close to marker sw <dig>  in a very low density marker map . furthermore, a gws qtl  for skat and indo is obtained between position  <dig> - <dig>  mb , which is within the same region as the cws androf qtl described in duroc above and recently detected by duijvesteijn et al.  <cit> . this is a very gene rich region with several biologically relevant genes.

ssc7
androstenone
a large region of highly significant qtl-effects for androstenone was found on ssc <dig> between positions  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb in both breeds. this result is supported by previous studies covering similarly large overlapping qtl regions between markers sw <dig> and sw <dig>  <cit>  and between markers tnfb  and s <dig>   <cit> . our results, however, seem to detect three different qtls within the region, localized at  <dig> - <dig>  mb ,  <dig> - <dig>  mb  and  <dig> - <dig>  mb  . differentiation of these three closely positioned qtls is made possible by the improved marker density in this study and therefore finer mapping resolution. in addition to the qtls 7a, 7b and 7c for androf, we detect a gws qtl for androp, testo, ediol and esulph  in position  <dig> - <dig>  mb which embraces the candidate gene cyp <dig> . cyp <dig> is a member of the cytochrome p <dig> superfamily enzymes, which is a key enzyme for corticosteroidogenesis  <cit>  and suggested to have arisen evolutionary from the same gene as cyp17a <dig>  <cit> . physiologically, cyp <dig> is known to lead to drastic fertility changes in human females  <cit> , and cyp <dig> has been found to be differentially expressed in landrace testes with high/low androstenone levels  <cit> . it is also relevant to note that a qtl for age-at-puberty has been detected in the same region, across a  <dig> cm interval around marker tnf , and we know that at least estron sulphate  is well known to be correlated with sexual maturity  <cit> . two genes located within qtl7a, scube <dig> and c6orf <dig> , are differentially expressed in testis from landrace and duroc boars with high/low levels of androstenone, respectively  <cit> . in addition to being gws for androf and androp, and cws for testo, ediol and esulph, qtl7b is highly gws for skatole and indole in both breeds . the gene encoding cyp1a <dig> is located within this region and is involved not only in skatole metabolism  <cit> , but also in steroidogenesis  <cit> . from comparative mapping with humans, another gene  is predicted to be located close to cyp1a <dig>  the cyp11a <dig> enzyme is known to catalyze the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone in the first and rate-limiting step of the steroid hormone synthesis  <cit> . previous results from the same norwegian populations used in this paper show differential expression of cyp11a <dig> in the liver of high-androstenone boars, however no significant association was detected in landrace, between a cyp11a <dig> snp and androstenone  <cit> . similarly, no significant cyp11a <dig> snp associations with androstenone were detected in the large white and meishan cross performed by quintanilla et al.  <cit> , which may be evidence to suggest that another candidate gene is involved and explains the differences seen for androstenone level. the gene ptpn <dig> localized within the qtl7b  has previously been found to be up-regulated in high androstenone duroc testis  <cit> . only one gene  has been annotated in qtl7c . this gene has a role in regulating gametogenesis, and disrupted vrk <dig> function is shown to result in infertile male and female mice  <cit> .

skatole
qtl7as for skat is located between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb and therefore overlaps with the qtl7b for androstenone discussed above. the cyp1a <dig> and cyp1a <dig> genes are oriented head-to-head in qtl7as and the enzyme products are found to be involved in degradation of skatole  <cit> . additionally, we detected a highly gws qtl  affecting skat and indo in both breeds . the lrt profiles for landrace, covering the most convincing qtl, are shown in figure  <dig>  qtl for skatole have recently been detected on ssc <dig> in a french population but in a different region  <cit> .

ssc9
a landrace specific qtl affecting androf on gws level and androp, ediol and esulph on cws level was detected between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb on ssc <dig>  a qtl for androstenone has previously been detected on ssc <dig> in a french large white population  <cit>  and for skatole in a meishan/large white cross  <cit> , although these have both been found in different chromosomal regions compared to our study.

ssc10
androstenone
a duroc specific qtl was detected on ssc <dig> affecting androstenone at gws level and affecting testo, ediol, esulph, skat and indo at cws level. no known genes are located within this region in pigs. it is however notable that a qtl for abnormal odor has been reported in the same chromosomal region  by lee et al.  <cit> .

skatole
two gws qtls  for skat and indo were detected for landrace only. no other qtl for skatole have previously been detected on ssc <dig> 

ssc11
androstenone
two gws breed specific qtls were detected in positions  <dig> - <dig>  mb  and  <dig> - <dig>  mb  in duroc and landrace, respectively. both qtl11a and qtl11b were also at least cws for both ediol and esulph. a qtl for androstenone in subcutaneous fat has been detected in french large white  <cit>  but in another position . in the region of qtl11a it was previously found  <cit>  that transcripts from exosc <dig> were differentially expressed in testis from high/low androstenone boars .

skatole
a landrace specific qtl was detected in position  <dig> - <dig>  mb affecting skat but not indo, in both gwa analysis and ldla methods. no qtls for skatole have previously been detected on ssc <dig> 

ssc13
androstenone
a highly significant and narrow region,  <dig> - <dig>  mb  was detected in duroc for both androp and androf, as well as for the other three sex steroids investigated in this study . a similar region is detected in landrace, but for androp, ediol and esulph only . no obvious candidate genes are located within the confidence interval, although two candidate genes in the solute carrier family  <dig>  members  <dig> and  <dig>  and slc22a <dig> ) are located very close . the substrate panel of slc22as includes important endogenous compounds like tryptophan metabolites  <cit> , and sulfated steroids  <cit> . a landrace specific qtl for androf and the two estrogens was detected from  <dig> - <dig>  mb . although not exactly corresponding, a qtl for 'androstenone at age of  <dig> days' was detected in a large white/meishan cross close to marker swr <dig> at  <dig> mb  <cit> , notably with a much lower marker density. two other qtls were detected in a large white population  <cit> , although at more distant chromosome positions. the gene kcnmb <dig>  expected to be located within qtl13b, was previously found to be differentially expressed in liver of high/low androstenone landrace boars . interestingly, gene expression of kcnmb <dig> is previously shown to be increased by 17β-estrogen stimulation, although this is studied in human müller cells only  <cit> .

skatole
a duroc specific qtl for skat and indo was detected from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb. one qtl has previously been detected for skatole on ssc <dig>  <cit>  but once again the position is not in agreement with our results.

ssc14
two gws qtls for skatole were detected on ssc <dig>  one of these was landrace specific and extended from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . no qtl for skatole have previously been observed in this region, although a qtl for 'androstenone at:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days' has been detected in the same region in a large white/meishan cross  <cit> . the second qtl extended between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb  and presented gws for skatole in landrace, and cws  in duroc. furthermore, the qtl is highly gws for indole in both breeds. the gene encoding cytochrome p <dig> 2e <dig> , which has a central role in the metabolism of skatole , is located at  <dig>  mb and is an excellent positional and biological candidate gene for this qtl. a previous study from our group utilizing exactly the same animal material, detected a haplotype within cyp2e <dig> which explained up to 6% of the phenotypic variance for skatole and up to 12% of the phenotypic variance for the indole  <cit> . our results are in close agreement with previous findings in danish landrace  <cit> .

ssc15
a very wide gws qtl located across a confidence interval from  <dig> - <dig>  mb on ssc <dig> in both breeds was affecting all the traits in this study , except for indo. this is a very gene rich region including several genes involved in sulfotransferase activity belonging to the cytochrome p <dig> family. from the studies of moe et al.  <cit>  as many as  <dig> genes within this qtl region were found to be differentially expressed in liver and/or testis in high/low androstenone boars . this indicates that several genes might be causing the qtl effect although only the genes encoding gcg  and star  are known to be correlated with level of different steroids like androgens and estrogens  <cit> . as far as we know no qtls for boar taint have previously been found on ssc <dig> 

ssc18
two landrace specific qtls were detected on ssc <dig> in positions  <dig> - <dig>  mb  and  <dig> - <dig>  mb . as far as we know no qtls for boar taint have previously been detected on ssc <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report utilizing a high density marker map for simultaneous analysis of boar taint compounds and related sex hormones, using both gwa and ldla approach. several qtls appear to be involved in regulation of androstenone and skatole, individually they explain relatively little of the total genetic variation. most of the qtls for androstenone are affecting both androstenone and estrogens, making practical implementation in breeding challenging. most qtls are also breed specific and we conclude that panels of snps for selection need to be designed for each breed separately. however,  <dig> qtls were detected in one breed and confirmed in the other breed, i.e. an independent sample. qtls that were not confirmed across breeds cannot be dismissed since the qtl may not be segregating in the other breed, i.e. the qtl is breed specific, or its effect may be substantially reduced in a different genetic background. qtls for skatole are mostly not negatively affecting sex hormones and should be easier to use directly into the current breeding scheme. generally, the combination of high density snp genotyping using the  <dig> k porcine snp array, gwa and ldla analysis revealed many genome-wide significant qtls , many of which were confirmed across breeds and tissues where the traits were recorded, and/or method of analysis. therefore, with the new and more precise information on snp-effects for androstenone and skatole, we currently suggest a breed specific panel for snps affecting androstenone only  and skatole. for further research, more knowledge is needed to determine the relationship between boar- and sow fertility, sex steroids and boar taint compounds to go to the next step of selection using all the genetic markers for androstenone detected in this study. it is a possibility that the effect of the qtls on the other steroids will reduce boar- and/or sow-fertility, in which case it is a problem for pork production.
