BACKGROUND
mitochondrial genomes of viridiplantae, outside of land plants, have been largely understudied. the disparity among mitochondrial genome data available for different classes of viridiplantae provides a limited view of the diversity belonging to these groups. being the closest relatives to land plants, studying the evolution of streptophyte algae has prompted the sequencing of multiple genomes from charophycean lineages . most representatives of mt genomes in the class chlorophyceae  come from the order volvocales, a morphologically diverse clade, ranging from the single celled chlamydomonas to the complex multicellular volvox. genome size in volvocales is thought to be correlated with organismal complexity  <cit> , but overall the mt genomes in this order are highly derived, showing great reduction in gene number and considerable diversity in size and non-coding content.

recently garnering attention, nine mt genomes were sequenced from the sister group of volvocales, the order sphaeropleales, previously characterized by only acutodesmus obliquus  <cit> . through phylogenetic analyses and examination of gene rearrangement and intron content, variation was seen across the sampling of sphaeropleales. considered not as derived as in the volvocales, the mt genome organization and gene content of acutodesmus obliquus is derived compared to non-chlorophyceans, with a similar general pattern following in the nine other mt genomes surveyed from the order  <cit> . in this way, a. obliquus has been noted as having an intermediate mt genome among the green algal lineages  <cit> . volvocalean mt genomes can be highly compact or bloated with repeats, harbor a reduced number of protein coding genes with a broad range of intron densities and gc content, and assemble as both linear and circular, depicting sphaeroplealean mt genomes as comparatively conserved  <cit> .

the known mt genomes of sphaeropleales consistently share  <dig> protein coding genes,  <dig> rnl and  <dig> rns fragments, and 22– <dig> trnas. these genomes vary mostly in size and intron content, but it is appropriate to say that the level of mt genome variation is moderate across the order, allowing the genome of a. obliquus to generally characterize the order. though they are sister groups, sphaeroplealean mt genomes are revealing to be substantially different from those in volvocales in terms of content and variability.

morphologically, the family hydrodictyaceae stands out in the order sphaeropleales due to the characteristic star-like colonies formed by its representative pediastrum meyen  <dig>  as well as the large, even macroscopic net-like colonies formed by the genus hydrodictyon roth  <dig> . in spite of the numerous morphological characters available for species delimitation, the systematics of hydrodictyaceae has been frequently debated and revised over the last decade , with dna sequence data revealing extensive cryptic diversity. several phylogenetic relationships remain to be clarified in the family, particularly the non-monophyly of pediastrum duplex  and its relationship to hydrodictyon   <cit>  that represent a taxonomic and evolutionary conundrum. genome-scale data will likely be necessary to fully understand the molecular and morphological evolution in hydrodictyaceae.fig.  <dig> morphological diversity in the green algal family hydrodictyaceae. a

to contribute to the sampling of mt genomes in sphaeropleales and test the phylogenetic patterns of gene arrangements and genome architecture within a family, we offer four fully assembled hydrodictyacean mt genomes, as well as protein-coding gene sequences from the fragmentary mt assembly of hydrodictyon reticulatum. as fučíková et al.  <cit>  only presented fragmentary genome data from hydrodictyaceae , our study is the first one to report the full mt genomes and is able to investigate the mt genome architecture in this family. we purport that the variability seen thus far across the order is present within a single family, as has been shown for bracteacoccaceae and neochloridaceae. these data show promise for resolving phylogenetic relationships among taxa within hydrodictyaceae while also lending themselves to aid in the further understanding of mt genome evolution across the green algal phylogeny.

RESULTS
data collection resulted in  <dig>  million reads for stauridium tetras ,  <dig>  million reads for pseudopediastrum boryanum ,  <dig>  million reads obtained for pediastrum duplex al0403mn , and  <dig>  million reads for pediastrum duplex pl0501b . all four mitochondrial genomes assembled with no gaps, the mean coverage for each was as follows: p. duplex al0403mn  <dig> x, p. duplex pl0501b 160x, ps. boryanum  <dig> x, and s. tetras  <dig> x. each genome assembled as a circular molecule  and contained  <dig> rnl gene fragments and  <dig> rns fragments,  <dig> trnas , and  <dig> protein coding genes including nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad4l, nad <dig>  nad <dig>  cob, cox <dig>  cox2a, cox <dig>  atp <dig>  and atp <dig>  the smallest mt genome belongs to s. tetras with  <dig>  bp. the mt genome of ps. boryanum has a length of  <dig>  bp, and p. duplex al0403mn and p. duplex pl0501b mt genomes are  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp, respectively.

a complete mt genome assembly of hydrodictyon reticulatum was not possible due to contamination and consequently low coverage. nine of the  <dig> protein coding genes expected to be present in all sphaeroplealean mt genomes were sequenced in full and while complete sequences were not recovered for atp <dig>  cox <dig>  nad <dig>  and nad4l, the portion of missing data was minimal .

the position of nad4l through trnl-cua comprises a conserved cluster of  <dig> genes in all four complete genomes . the gene cluster trnd-guc, nad <dig>  cox <dig>  rnl <dig>  rns <dig> is also conserved in each genome. nad <dig> has a completely different position in each genome. the rns and rnl gene fragments are clustered together in each genome, though not in identical orders. moreover, the order of the fragments is scrambled , but scrambled in the same manner across the genomes .fig.  <dig> mauve alignment of four linearized hydrodictyaceae genomes, beginning at the gene cob. blocks of genes  are labeled in stauridium tetras. boxes under each genome map represent protein-coding genes , rrna genes  and trna genes 



introns are present only in cox <dig>  cob, and rnl <dig> . stauridium tetras, hydrodictyon, and p. duplex utex lb <dig> possess a homologous group ii intron in cox <dig>  while p. boryanum and p. duplex al0403mn contain a group ib intron at a nearby position in cox <dig>  pediastrum duplex pl0501b has a group id intron roughly in the middle of cox <dig>  introns are present in the cob gene in p. duplex al0403mn, ps. boryanum, and hydrodictyon - the latter two are homologous group id introns, while the first is group ii and appears related to the cox <dig> group ii introns. the rnl <dig> gene is uninterrupted in ps. boryanum, s. tetras, p. duplex utex lb <dig>  and possibly also in hydrodictyon . a group ia intron is inserted in the rnl <dig> gene of p. duplex al0403mn and a group ib intron is present in p. duplex pl0501b, at a different position.fig.  <dig> mitochondrial intron types and distribution in three mitochondrial genes of the order sphaeropleales



the trna specifying threonine is absent from all genomes, and keeping with the deviant genetic code of acutodesmus obliquus, leucine is coded for by uag . the sphaeropleales-specific stop codon uca is used infrequently in comparison to uaa, but terminates nad <dig> in all examined hydrodictyaceans. stauridium tetras is an exception, as this taxon uses uca in  <dig> of the  <dig> protein-coding genes and only uses uaa in atp <dig>  cox <dig>  cox2a, and nad <dig> 

phylogenetic analyses
results of all phylogenetic analyses, including all five ml searches and the bayesian consensus tree, agreed on the same, completely resolved topology . all relationships among sphaeropleales corresponded to the mitochondrial tree presented in fučíková et al.  <cit> , including neochloris being the closest relative of hydrodictyaceae and chlorotetraedron being sister to neochloris + hydrodictyaceae. relationships among the six included hydrodictyaceae were well supported, with stauridium being sister to the remaining representatives, pseudopediastrum boryanum sister to hydrodictyon + pediastrum duplex. pediastrum duplex was recovered as monophyletic with absolute support. badger analysis of gene rearrangements within sphaeropleales grouped the four representatives of hydrodictyaceae as a group with  <dig>  support . pseudopediastrum boryanum + s. tetras were resolved as sister to p. duplex al043mn + p. duplex pl0501b.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree yielded by ml and bayesian analyses of  <dig> mitochondrial protein-coding genes. bayesian consensus tree is shown with support indicated by numbers at branches, representing bayesian posterior probabilities  and ml bootstrap  support values, respectively. scale bar represents the estimat­ed number of substitutions per site. bars on the right represent mt genome size and composition, as well as total intron number for each taxon



discussion
mitochondrial genomes of viridiplantae range from hyperinflated and hypervariable in land plants to compact and conserved in some lineages of green algae. from the information available for the class chlorophyceae, sphaeropleales appear to be closer to the conservative end of the spectrum, especially compared to their sister order volvocales  <cit> . our study zooms in on the sphaeroplealean family hydrodictyaceae and compares four fully sequenced and two partially sequenced mt genomes from taxa that span the phylogenetic breadth of the family. this study is the first to report a complete mt genome sequence for the family hydrodictyaceae, and among the first ones to compare within-family mt genome diversity in green algae.

genome size and structure
the large size difference among genomes of different strains is primarily due to expansion of intergenic regions , and the number of introns does not scale directly with genome size due to high variation in size of individual introns. this correlation appears to be the case across sphaeropleales: for example, neochloris’s  <dig> introns  combined are of lesser length than the  <dig> introns of kirchneriella . the newly sequenced pediastrum duplex pl0501b has the largest reported mt genome in sphaeropleales but contains only two introns.

the deepest-diverging hydrodictyacean, stauridium tetras, has a genome size very similar to those of the closest known relatives of hydrodictyaceae: neochloris and chlorotetraedron . it is therefore possible that the ancestral mt genome size for the neochloridaceae + hydrodictyaceae clade was in the vicinity of 38 kb. however, in contrast to s. tetras and chlorotetraedron, neochloris has a much higher intron content and lower spacer content, which makes such an interpretation of genome size evolution less straightforward as there may be different driving forces behind the proliferation of introns and contraction of intergenic spacers. in the p. duplex group the mt genomes appear to have expanded both due to intron acquisition and spacer expansion .

within chlorophyta, the cox <dig> gene shows varying degrees of fragmentation and migration. algae belonging to prasinophyceae, ulvophyceae, and trebouxiophyceae contain orthodox, intact mitochondrial cox <dig> genes  <cit> . chlorophycean algae exhibit split cox <dig> genes, possessing either a mitochondrion-encoded cox2a and a cox2b fragment that has migrated to the nucleus  or having both cox2a and cox2b relocated to the nucleus following a reduced-derived pattern   <cit> . as expected, the four newly sequenced genomes presented appear to have a mitochondrial cox2a gene, emphasizing the intermediate evolutionary pattern of sphaeropleales and building a strong case for distinguishing phylogenetic relationships.

orientating the gene arrangements so that cob begins and nad <dig> ends the sequence, gene rearrangement is prominent in the regions flanked by the rrna fragments and “end” of the genomes in both p. duplex, while in s. tetras and p. boryanum gene rearrangement is present only from the “beginning” to the end of the rrna fragments . additional patterns of gene rearrangements are discussed below.

intron diversity
considerable diversity and abundance of introns in the cob, cox <dig>  and rnl <dig> genes was previously described for sphaeroplealean mt genomes  <cit> . compared to the diversity found across the order, hydrodictyaceae have relatively intron-poor mt genomes and, in the strains examined here, no more than one intron per gene is found. yet, all of the major intron types  found across sphaeropleales are found in hydrodictyaceae as well . the group ii intron found near the 3′ end of cox <dig> in hydrodictyon, pediastrum duplex utex lb <dig>  and stauridium is unique among sphaeropleales. interestingly however, blast analyses show its relatedness to the cob gene of p. duplex al0403mn , which appears homologous with an identically positioned cob intron in chromochloris zofingiensis . a notable 67 % identity in the conserved regions with a cox <dig> intron of the red alga pyropia was also detected . the ancestry of this intron is unclear from the available data, but it can be hypothesized that the intron was either present ancestrally in the cob gene of all sphaeropleales and lost many times , or transferred horizontally into the cob gene of p. duplex al0403mn. either way, this intron may have been present in the ancestral mt genome of hydrodictyaceae in the cox <dig> gene  and subsequently lost in some members of the family. much denser taxon sampling will be required to accurately reconstruct the undoubtedly complex evolutionary history of these introns.

the group id intron found in the cob gene of hydrodictyon and pseudopediastrum appears homologous to the same type introns present in several other sphaeroplealeans , and might therefore be ancestral to the order. in fact, its conserved 3′ end bears significant sequence similarity  to identically positioned cob introns of volvox carteri and other green algae including trebouxia aggregata  and the streptophytes chlorokybus atmophyticus, mesostigma viride, and chaetosphaeridium globosum, as well as several fungi . the original invasion of this intron into mt genomes might therefore reach deep into the green algal, or even eukaryote, phylogeny.

phylogeny of hydrodictyaceae
previous studies concerning the systematics of hydrodictyaceae split pediastrum duplex into two clades, of which “group i”  was more closely related to hydrodictyon than to “group ii” . these relationships were mainly supported by the nuclear 28s ribosomal large subunit gene  <cit>  and weakly indicated also by results based on the nuclear its- <dig> and chloroplast rbcl, psaa, psab genes  <cit> , unpublished data. contrarily, our study recovered p. duplex as a monophyletic species with strong statistical support with hydrodictyon as its sister taxon . of course, the present taxon sampling is sparse compared to the studies of nuclear and chloroplast genes, which included dozens of hydrodictyacean isolates. however, it is worth noting that the 28s gene, which supports non-monophyly of p. duplex, only contained  <dig> parsimony-informative characters   <cit> . the rbcl gene is more variable   <cit>  but does not provide any statistical support for the grouping of p. duplex group i and hydrodictyon. in contrast, our mt data set contains  <dig> parsimony-informative sites , and when reduced to reflect the phylogenetic breadth included in mcmanus and lewis  <cit> , i.e., hydrodictyaceae with neochloris as outgroup,  <dig> parsimony-informative characters remain .

the pattern of gene rearrangement, along with other characteristics seen in the genomes, is reflected in the phylogeny . however, without a much denser sampling of hydrodictyaceae and their closest relatives, it is impossible to determine the ancestral mt genome structure in the family, with the exception of a handful of conserved blocks of genes. stauridium tetras and ps. boryanum, the two deepest diverging hydrodictyaceans sampled in this study, share the same gene order over a span of  <dig> genes . this block of genes might be ancestral to hydrodictyaceae but is not found in closest relatives of the family . a cluster of  <dig> trna genes forms a consistent block with the cob gene, and this block is likely ancestral to hydrodictyaceae. the majority of the trna gene cluster is also found in chlorotetraedron and neochloris , but it follows nad <dig> instead of cob. the nad3-rns <dig> block and the rnl4-rnl <dig> block are in close proximity to each other and on the same strand, with the exception of ps. boryanum. the gene order in both p. duplex genomes is identical from cob to rnl <dig>  and toward the “end” from nad <dig> to nad <dig>  in p. duplex pl0501b, the rnl4-rnl <dig> block and the adjacent cox <dig> gene appear to have relocated as a single unit relative to al0403mn. additional mt genomes from across the family  are necessary to determine if gene order will aid with resolving phylogeny, and especially to reconstruct the relative timing of rearrangement events that shaped the extant genomes.

CONCLUSIONS
presenting the first mt genomes of the family hydrodictyaceae, and being one of the only family-level studies of mt genome diversity in the green algae, this study highlights the potential of phylogenetic informativeness and resolving power of fine scale, whole genome studies. even though this study lacks the taxon sampling to credibly resolve the question of monophyly of p. duplex, our data nevertheless show great promise for addressing systematic questions in hydrodictyaceae. expanding the representation of mt genome data across the family will further aid in our understanding of mt genome evolution across the green algae.
