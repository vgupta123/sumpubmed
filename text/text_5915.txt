BACKGROUND
the human gene seps <dig>  located on chromosome 15q <dig> , encodes selenoprotein s which participates in the retro-translocation of misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum  to the cytosol for their degradation  <cit> . this er membrane protein functions in stress responses to prevent the deleterious consequences of accumulation of misfolded proteins, accumulation that has been linked to immune and inflammatory processes  <cit> . a study identified the strong association of the proximal promoter seps <dig> polymorphism at -105g/a with circulating levels of three pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin - <dig>  il-1β and tnf-α  <cit> . moreover, these authors reported that the mutant variant significantly reduced the promoter activity of the seps <dig> gene in stressed hepg <dig> cells and that the suppression of this gene by short interfering rna increased the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in a macrophage cell line. a regulatory loop has been recently proposed whereby cytokines stimulate the expression of seps <dig>  which in turn diminishes cytokine production  <cit> .

the murine homolog gene of the human seps <dig> is the tanis gene, which encodes a serum amyloid a receptor  <cit> . acute phase serum amyloid a proteins  are multifunctional apolipoproteins produced in large amounts during the acute phase of inflammation and also during the development of chronic inflammatory diseases. saas are involved in the pathogenesis of several chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis   <cit> , multiple sclerosis  <cit>  and inflammatory bowel diseases   <cit> . it is believed that locally synthesized saa by synovial cells in the inflamed joints acts as an autocrine inducer of matrix metalloproteinase- <dig> and causes extensive joint erosion  <cit> .

altogether these data point to the important role of selenoprotein s mediating inflammation, and we aimed at testing whether the seps <dig> gene was involved in the development of inflammatory autoimmune complex diseases. these are multifactorial traits influenced by both genetic predisposing factors and environmental triggers. the activation of seps <dig> expression by fasting in vivo and by glucose-deprivation in vitro allowed its assignation to the glucose-regulated protein family  <cit> . furthermore, a locus on 15q <dig>  iddm <dig>  was described to increase susceptibility to type  <dig> diabetes, t1d  <cit> . therefore, we decide to test the seps <dig> polymorphisms for association with diabetes risk in a cohort of spanish t1d patients. additionally, we pursued to study two other autoimmune diseases with an important inflammatory component, rheumatoid arthritis and the inflammatory bowel diseases, crohn's disease  and ulcerative colitis . provided this candidate gene previously related with the inflammatory response shows any influence on the pathogenesis of these diseases, a new mechanistic tool for treatment would be available.

methods
patients and controls
the study group consisted of  <dig> ra,  <dig> ibd and  <dig> t1d unrelated patients, consecutively recruited from one centre, either hospital clínico san carlos or hospital ramón y cajal .

t1d patients  diagnosed according to the criteria of the american diabetes association , were insulin-dependent at the time to study.

ra diagnosis was established based on the american college of rheumatology  criteria  <cit>  and samples were previously genotyped for hla-drb <dig>  mean age at onset was  <dig> ±  <dig> years; 61% of the patients carried the shared epitope; 66% and 50% of the patients were positive for rheumatoid factor and for anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, respectively, and 32% of the patients presented nodular disease.

diagnosis of ibd patients was based on standard clinical, radiologic, endoscopic and histologic criteria  <cit> . the mean age at onset for uc patients was  <dig> years; 41% of the patients presented pancolitis; 47% and 13% of the patients suffered extraintestinal manifestations and colectomy, respectively. cd patients were classified according to the location of the lesions in ileal , colonic , ileocolonic  and upper gastrointestinal tract  and according to the disease behavior in inflammatory , stricturing  and perforating . only 20% of the cd patients debuted after the age of  <dig> 

a group of  <dig> healthy unrelated subjects from madrid  were selected as controls. cases and controls were all white spanish subjects and were included in this study after written informed consent. the ethics committee of hospital clínico  approved the study.

seps <dig> polymorphisms
the seps <dig> polymorphisms  were genotyped using taqman assays from applied biosystems following manufacturer's suggestions and analyzed in an abi 7900ht fast real-time pcr system . their location is indicated by the distance from the transcription start site: two of them are in the promoter region; another two in intron 5; rs <dig> depending of alternative splicing is either in intron  <dig> or in the 3'utr region; and the last one is downstream at  <dig> .

statistical analysis
allele and genotype frequencies in patients and controls were compared by χ <dig> test or fisher exact test when necessary; p values were considered significant at a level of < <dig> . odds ratio  and p values were calculated using a standard package . for an or =  <dig> , the statistical power of our cohorts ranged from  <dig> – 95% depending on the specific polymorphism analyzed.

haplotypic frequencies were estimated using the expectation-maximization algorithm implemented in the arlequin v <dig>  software  <cit>  with number of iterations set at  <dig> and initial conditions at  <dig>  with an epsilon value of 10- <dig> 

RESULTS
the present study investigates the influence of all seps <dig> variants previously correlated with increased pro-inflammatory cytokines levels  and of the seps <dig> haplotypes on predisposition to inflammatory complex diseases.

we first analyzed the functional seps <dig> promoter polymorphism at -105g/a and no significant differences in genotypic frequencies were observed when healthy controls were compared with patients suffering from t1d, ra or ibd . as two other variants  have been associated with high plasma cytokine levels  <cit> , we studied them in our cohorts, and the distribution of genotypes followed the same pattern in patients and in controls .

we selected three additional polymorphisms along the gene from those described by curran et al  <cit>  in order to analyze the haplotypes inferred by applying the expectation-maximization algorithm implemented in the arlequin software. no significant difference in haplotype frequencies was observed after appropriate correction for multiple testing in any diseased cohort .

a direct functionality has been attributed to the seps <dig> promoter polymorphism at -105g/a, increasing plasma levels of the aforementioned cytokines presumably due to the disruption of an er stress element . two other tested variants have also been strongly related with the circulating levels of the inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . in contrast, a recent report did not find consistent association of this polymorphism with circulating levels of either il- <dig> or tnf-α  <cit> . we did not observe differences in the genotypic distribution of the seps <dig> polymorphisms analyzed in spanish cohorts between patients suffering from autoimmune diseases with a clear inflammatory component, like t1d, ra or ibd, and controls. the analysis of seps <dig> haplotypic frequencies did not differ between patients and healthy individuals either.

given that evidences exist for the affected expression and activity of some selenoproteins depending on sexual dimorphism in mouse  <cit>  and human  <cit> , we decided to check for a gender specific association of -105g/a seps <dig> polymorphism with the autoimmune disorders under study; however, we did not detect a gender-bias in our results. no significant difference between sex-stratified cohorts was found for any of the polymorphisms studied .

seps <dig> expression was not significantly altered in intestinal epithelial cells of ibd murine models or in intestinal biopsies from ibd patients when compared with that present in controls  <cit> . concordantly, a study testing the association of the promoter variant at - <dig> with cerebrovascular disease found no influence on stroke risk  <cit> . both studies are in agreement with our results that showed lack of association between seps <dig> polymorphisms and susceptibility to chronic inflammatory diseases. moreover, a finnish study of five variants in the seps <dig> gene locus showed no significant difference between carriers/non-carriers when cardiovascular cases and healthy individuals were compared. the authors suggested that two polymorphisms contribute to the risk for coronary heart disease and for ischemic stroke in females; interestingly, the associated polymorphisms do not correspond with the one at -105g/a  <cit> . therefore, evidences are mounting against the role of the seps <dig> gene in all these conditions, with the only exception to this point of one report defining the minor allele at -105g/a seps <dig> as a risk factor for preeclampsia in a large norwegian cohort  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the wellcome trust case control consortium published recently a genome wide association study for several inflammatory conditions, such as ra, t1d or cd  <cit>  although the chromosomal region where the gene maps did not show association for any of the mentioned diseases, the seps <dig> polymorphisms were not analyzed and therefore their involvement in susceptibility could not be formally excluded. ours is a thorough study analyzing the influence of six polymorphisms along the seps <dig> gene on susceptibility to common diseases, unravelling lack of association. our data allow discardind a major individual role of this gene in the aetiology of the studied polygenic diseases.
