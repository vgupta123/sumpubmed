BACKGROUND
multidrug resistance  constitutes a major obstacle for success of cancer treatment. the mdr phenotype is responsible for resistance to a wide variety of anticancer drugs, such as anthracyclines, vinca-alkaloids and others  <cit> . although several mechanisms could be involved in the acquisition of this phenotype, the role of two different membrane proteins, p-glycoprotein  and multidrug resistance associated protein , has been well established  <cit> . both proteins are members of the same atp-binding cassette  superfamily of transport proteins. pgp was first identified as a consequence of its overexpression in multidrug-resistant tumour cells, where it mediates the atp-dependent efflux of a variety of chemotherapeutic agents. in addition to its role during the acquisition of the mdr phenotype, pgp is expressed in normal tissues, both as a consequence of differentiation and also in response to environmental challenges, and it has been proposed to play a role as a cell protector against cellular toxins  <cit> . in addition, a general antiapoptotic role for pgp has been proposed  <cit> . it is clear that pgp has several functions in different cells and tissues.

pgp is encoded by a multigene family in higher eukaryotes  <cit> . the abcb <dig> gene  encodes the human pgp. in cultured cells, constitutive overexpression of pgp is mediated by changes in gene dosage or transcription. pgp can also be transiently induced in cultured cells by a variety of stimuli, such as heat shock, uv radiation, and chemotherapeutic agents  <cit> . the regulation of pgp expression has been mostly related to transcriptional control of the abcb <dig> gene expression  <cit> . the proximal promoter of abcb <dig> contains several regulatory regions, such as an inverted ccaat box and a gc element, both of which are required for constitutive promoter activity in several cell lines  <cit> . it has been reported that in the colon carcinoma cell line sw <dig>  the histone deacetylase inhibitor  trichostatin a , induces an increase in abcb <dig> transcription through the inverted ccaat box element, with the requirement of the nf-y transcription factor  <cit> . this result can denote a big caveat, since a number of ihdacs are able to inhibit tumour growth, and several of them are used in clinical trials  <cit> . however, an increase in pgp expression mediated by these inhibitors would hamper their combination with other cytotoxic agents that are substrates of pgp. we have previously investigated in the human colon carcinoma cell lines sw <dig>  ht- <dig> and ht-29/m <dig> the effect of tsa and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid  on pgp expression, demonstrating a translational control of pgp expression  <cit> . the mdr <dig> mrna produced in these cell lines is 285 bp shorter that the mdr <dig> mrna produced in the human mcf-7/adr and k562/adr cell lines, both of them expressing pgp protein. the different size of the mdr <dig> mrna is due to the use of alternative promoters  <cit> . interestingly, the abcb <dig> gene is located in a genetic locus with the nested gene rundc3b in the complementary dna strand. more specifically, several rundc3b exons are located in the complementary strand of the abcb <dig> gene that corresponds with the intronic region between exon − <dig> and exon  <dig> of the mdr <dig> mrna, raising the possibility of transcriptional interference between both genes. the study presented herein has been designed to gain insight in abcb <dig> regulation determining whether the translational control of pgp functions also in pancreatic cancer cell lines, the putative regulation of abcb <dig> alternative promoters by ihdacs, and whether the expression of the abcb <dig> nested gene rundc3b interferes with the expression of the mdr <dig> mrna isoforms.

RESULTS
effect of histone deacetylase inhibitors on pgp mrna expression in different pancreatic carcinoma cell lines
to determine ihdacs effects in mdr <dig> mrna expression in human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines, we analyzed the level of mdr <dig> mrna by real time rt-pcr in imim-pc- <dig>  imim-pc- <dig> and rwp- <dig> human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines in the presence and absence of tsa and saha. results in figure 1a show that treatment with tsa or saha induced an increase in mdr <dig> mrna levels in these cell lines. despite this increase in mdr <dig> mrna levels, we have previously reported that tsa and other ihdacs are able to inhibit cell growth and to induce apoptosis in these pancreatic carcinoma cell lines  <cit> .

effect of histone deacetylase inhibitors on p-glycoprotein expression
to test whether the increase observed in the level of mdr <dig> mrna correlates with an increase in pgp protein, we analyzed pgp protein levels by western immunoblot in imim-pc- <dig>  imim-pc- <dig> and rwp- <dig> cells in the presence or absence of tsa, using as a positive control the human erythroleukemia cell line k562adr that expresses high levels of pgp protein  <cit> . as shown in figure 1b, there is no evidence of pgp protein expression in these cell lines either before or after tsa treatment. to confirm that the lack of signal in the western blot analysis of pgp protein shown in figure 1b was not due to the expression of a pgp variant unable to react with the antibody used, western blot analyses were performed with pgp antibodies targeted againt different regions of the pgp protein and we could not detect pgp expression with any of the antibodies tested . we also analyzed pgp activity determining the accumulation of daunomycin , a fluorescent substrate of pgp, in cells treated or untreated with ihdacs, using as a positive control l1210r cells. the presence of an active pgp in these cell lines was demonstrated by the increased accumulation of dnm observed after addition of the pgp inhibitor verapamil . our results in figure 1c show that no functional pgp was present in imim-pc- <dig>  imim-pc- <dig> and rwp- <dig> cell lines, either in the presence or in the absence of tsa.

translational control of pgp mrna in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines
after demonstrating that the increase in mdr <dig> mrna levels due to idhacs treatment did not correspond with an increase in pgp protein expression or activity, and since these results resembled our previous findings in colon carcinoma cell lines  <cit> , we decided to determine whether the mdr <dig> mrna present in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines included the longer or the shorter 5′ utr form , and whether the translational control was a general phenomenon in pancreatic cancer cells. in order to do that, we extended this study to other pancreatic cell lines. results in figure 2b show that neither the pancreatic carcinoma cell lines, imim-pc- <dig>  imim-pc- <dig> and rwp- <dig> nor the new added cell lines hs 766 t, bxpc- <dig> and panc- <dig> express the longer 5′utr mdr <dig> mrna, suggesting a generalized translational control of pgp expression in human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines, since the new added cell lines were also negative for pgp expression in western blot analysis . we have used k- <dig> adr  and htc- <dig>  as positive controls, since both of them express a functional p-glycoprotein . furthermore, figure  <dig> shows the effects of tsa on mdr <dig> mrna levels, as determined by real time rt-pcr in imim-pc- <dig>  imim-pc- <dig>  rwp- <dig>  panc- <dig>  hs 766 t and bxpc- <dig> cells. all the cell lines except bxpc- <dig> show an increase in mdr <dig> mrna levels after tsa treatment.

tsa regulates differentially the abcb <dig> promoters
the longer and the shorter 5′ utr forms of mdr <dig> mrna have been related to the existence of two abcb <dig> alternative promoters  <cit> . to determine the effects of tsa on both abcb <dig> gene promoters, we analyzed the levels of mdr <dig> mrna after 24 h treatment with tsa in a panel of cell lines of different origin that have been divided in two groups. group a includes cell lines that we have analyzed previously and use the downstream promoter  which transcribes the short 5′utr mdr1mrna . group b includes cell lines which use the upstream promoter  that transcribes the long 5′utr mdr <dig> mrna . results in figure  <dig> clearly demonstrate differential effects of tsa on dsp and usp promoters and suggest that tsa is able to downregulate the usp promoter and upregulate the dsp promoter in the abcb <dig> gene. to further demonstrate that tsa downregulates the usp promoter and therefore inhibits the expression of an active p-glycoprotein, we decided to include in this study three additional colon carcinoma cell lines: ls-174 t, colo- <dig> and dld- <dig> that express p-glycoprotein, as shown by western blot analysis in figure 5a. figure 5b shows that these cell lines express the long 5′-utr mdr <dig> mrna and, furthermore, that tsa treatment decreased the levels of expression of the long 5′-utr mdr <dig> mrna in all of them. even more, we used k- <dig> cell sublines resistant to different concentrations of daunomycin that have been generated in our laboratory by selective pressure with increasing concentrations of the drug. we have previously shown that resistance to daunomycin in this sublines was related to the active expression of p-glycoprotein, and that this expression correlates with the expression of the long 5′-utr mdr <dig> mrna  <cit> . as shown in figure 5c, tsa was able to increase daunomycin accumulation in the k- <dig> d <dig> , a subline that expresses p-glycoprotein and the long 5′-utr mdr <dig> mrna associated with the usp promoter  <cit> . this result suggests that tsa decreases p-glycoprotein expression leading to an increased accumulation of daunomycin in these cells. futhermore, as shown in figure 5c, tsa downregulated mdr <dig> mrna, as determined by real time pcr in k- <dig> d <dig>  a cell subline which expresses high levels of p-glycoprotein and also the long 5′-utr mdr <dig> mrna . meanwhile, tsa increased the expression of the mdr <dig> mrna in the parental k <dig> that does not express p-glycoprotein and expresses the short 5′-utr mdr <dig> mrna.

tsa effect on rundc3b mrna levels
the abcb <dig> gene is located in a genetic locus with the nested gene rundc3b in the complementary dna strand . based on this special localization, we investigated whether the expression of rundc3b mrna was regulated by tsa and whether the expression of this mrna was related to the expression of the short or the long 5′utr of the mdr <dig> mrna. as shown in figure 6b, tsa upregulates rundc3b mrna expression levels independently of the mdr <dig> mrna isoform  expressed in the different cell lines.

discussion
in the present study, we demonstrate that the increase in mdr- <dig> mrna levels induced by ihdacs inhibitors in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines does not parallel an increase in pgp protein or in pgp activity. this observation is important since we and others have reported that the histone deacetylase inhibitors tsa and saha induce two major effects in several drug-resistant cell lines: down-regulation of pgp and induction of apoptosis. in that sense, we have demonstrated that tsa markedly reduced pgp expression in the l1210r drug-resistant murine cell line  <cit>  and “sensitized” these cells to daunomycin  <cit> , as shown in figure 1c, where tsa treatment increases dnm accumulation in l1210r cells, suggesting that ihdacs might have a therapeutic potential against chemoresistant tumours. however, other authors had reported an increase in the steady-state level of mdr <dig> mrna upon treatment with tsa  <cit> , suggesting that ihdacs could not be utilized in combination with other cytotoxic agents that are substrates of pgp. our results in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines, which are in agreement with our previously published results in colon carcinoma cell lines  <cit> , strongly suggest that expression of mdr <dig> mrna is necessary but not sufficient for pgp protein expression.

next, we tried to identify the putative mechanisms involved in this phenomenon and we concluded that a translational blockade of pgp expression takes place in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines, in agreement with our previous studies in colon carcinoma cell lines after tsa treatment  <cit>  and in the human erytroleukaemia k- <dig> cell line  <cit> .

our data suggest that the translational blockade of mdr <dig> mrna in the colon and pancreatic carcinoma cell lines and in k- <dig> cells could be overcome by alterations in the 5′ end of the mdr <dig> mrna in the resistant variants of these cell lines. these results are especially relevant since we have previously demonstrated the relationship between the expression of the long 5′utr mdr <dig> mrna and the final expression of an active pgp protein  <cit> . the origin and nature of these mdr <dig> mrna isoforms became clear when raguz et al.  <cit>  reported the presence of an abcb <dig> gene upstream promoter in breast carcinoma samples. both promoters would translate the same protein because they use the same atg codon, but the mrna transcribed from the upstream promoter is approximately 285 bp longer in its 5′ end than the mdr <dig> mrna transcribed from the downstream promoter. our data, together with results published by other groups, strongly suggest that expression of mdr <dig> mrna is necessary but not sufficient for pgp protein expression, indicating that mdr <dig> mrna is subjected to a negative translational control. during the acquisition of chemoresistance there is a switch from the downstream to the upstream abcb <dig> gene promoter, and this promoter transcribes a mdr <dig> mrna that is translated more efficiently. to sustain this hypothesis, we have demonstrated that the expression of an active pgp protein correlates with the activation of the upstream promoter of the abcb <dig> gene in several k- <dig> cellular sublines obtained by selective pressure with increasing concentrations of daunomycin  <cit>  and figure  <dig> 

in addition, the results shown herein demonstrate that short and long 5′utr mdr <dig> mrnas are differentially regulated by the histone deacetylase inhibitor tsa, indicating that both promoters are differentially regulated by ihdacs. this is a compelling observation because tsa is able not only to downregulate the promoter responsible for active pgp protein expression but also to induce apoptosis in colon and pancreatic carcinoma cells, sensitizing them to other chemotherapeutic agents that are substrates of pgp. in addition, we observed that tsa increased mdr <dig> mrna in the parental k- <dig> cells, whereas tsa decreased mdr <dig> mrna levels in the daunomycin-resistant k- <dig> sublines which express pgp protein and employ the usp promoter. this suggests again a differential regulation by tsa of both abcb <dig> promoters.

we have also study the effect of tsa on the regulation of the rundc3b gene, since this is a nested gene transcribed from the abcb1complementary dna strand. these studies were designed to test the hypothesis that the regulation of the abcb <dig> nested gene rundc3b could interfere with the alternative expression of both 5′utr mdr <dig> mrnas, since some of the exons of the rundc3b mrna lie on the complementary strand of the abcb <dig> gene, as shown in figure 6a. our results demonstrate that tsa is able to increase rundc3b mrna levels, independently of the abcb <dig> promoters that are active in these cell lines. rundc3b has been related to a more metastatic phenotype in breast cancer patients  <cit> . according to this, we could speculate a selection of rundc3b expression in colon and pancreatic carcinoma cell lines, instead of a functional pgp protein expression, since expression of rundc3b could represent an additional advantage in their evolution to a more aggressive phenotype. however, taking into consideration our results, we cannot conclude that the expression of rundc3b could be in some way incompatible with the abcb <dig> usp promoter expression forcing the cells to use the dsp promoter.

although our data fit quite well with the existence of two abcb <dig> promoters, some authors  <cit>  have found that the additional 5′-utr that is important for p-glycoprotein expression is due not to the use of an alternative promoter, but mostly to epigenetic changes in the region where this additional exon lies . in fact, and based on chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and transient transfection of reporter genes under the control of the putative region where usp promoter lies, they concluded that the reason for the alternative 5′-utr mdr1mrna expression is due to epigenetic changes, mostly related to histone h <dig> acetylation. the situation in the putative upstream promoter cannot be explained only by histone acetylation because tsa generally produces a state of hyperacetylation due to histone deacetylases inhibition. global general hyperacetylation is related to an increase in transcription and however upstream promoter transcription is inhibited. epigenetic control of pgp expression has been previously suggested by different authors, which found that demethylating agents were able to induce pgp- mediated chemoresistance in different cellular models  <cit> , we have some preliminary data with primary cultures derived from tumours of patients with colon cancer. in some of these cultures, we found that pgp expression was lost. in some clonal populations obtained by extreme dilution of these cultures the long mdr1mrna isoform and pgp expression after treatment with dna demethylating agents was recovered, suggesting that dna methylation is involved in the expression of the mdr1mrna isoforms . however, it is unclear whether pgp expression is regulated by two different promoters or by epigenetic mechanisms that modifies the activity of a single promoter. since tsa is an epigenetic drug, from our results it is difficult to discriminate whether tsa downregulates the usp promoter or, alternatively modifies the epigenetic status of a specific region of the abcb <dig> gene. in any case, we can affirm that tsa inhibits the expression of an active p-glycoprotein. the authors that argument the epigenetic changes as the main reason for the long 5′-utr mdr1mrna production suggest that the nested gene rundc3b is only expressed when the long 5′-utr mdr1mrna is expressed, or in other words that there is a correlation between the expression of both mrnas. our data do not support this hypothesis, because as seen in figure 6b, rundc3b mrna is expressed in cell lines that express the short 5′-utr mdr <dig> mrna, suggesting that the expression of both genes is not regulated simultaneously by the same epigenetic changes in a specific genomic region.

CONCLUSIONS
the results shown herein show that the risk of a putative increase in pgp expression after ihdacs treatment is clinically irrelevant since it does not render an active pgp protein, at least in colon and pancreatic cancer cell lines. in addition, we have demonstrated that tsa regulates differentially both abcb <dig> promoters and upregulates rundc3b mrna expression levels independently of the abcb <dig> promoter in use.
