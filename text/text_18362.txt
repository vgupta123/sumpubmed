BACKGROUND
evolutionary pressures, including selection, determine the level of genetic and epigenetic variation within populations. this variation, in interaction with the environment, results in continuous phenotypic variation for life-history traits. for a given trait, the response to selection is measured by the deviation of phenotypic mean from one generation to another. it depends on the trait heritability  <cit>  measured as the additive variance that is transmitted from parents to offspring  <cit>  divided by the total phenotypic variance. on the one hand, trait heritability depends on the susceptibility of the trait to environmental fluctuations. on the other hand, it depends on the total genetic and epigenetic variation as well as the modalities of transmission of those components. for example, interactions between alleles, that are not transmitted in panmictic populations, and epigenetic variants, that are non-mendelian inherited, contribute to the total phenotypic variation but may result in decreased heritability  <cit> .

genetic or epigenetic variance comprises additive, dominance and epistatic variance components. the two latter variance components imply interactions between alleles. additive variance instead designates the effect of an allele as measured by its average deviation from the population phenotypic mean. a long-standing controversy revolves around the relative importance of additive versus non-additive  effects. its last avatar, the so-called "missing heritability" paradox, arose from genome-wide linkage and association mapping studies. indeed, for a broad range of traits and organisms, locus-by-locus studies have revealed that genomic polymorphisms associated with phenotypic variation of complex traits typically account for a small fraction of additive variance  <cit>  while additive variance is known to be by far the greatest contributor of the total genetic variance  <cit> .

multiple non-exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to resolve this paradox among which an excess of rare alleles limiting detection power  <cit> , and a prominence of undetectable epistatic interactions that could significantly contribute to phenotypic variation  <cit> . growing knowledge on biological pathways and gene networks indeed points to pervasive gene interactions at the molecular levels . such interactions appear as key features of traits architecture and quantitative variation . however the amount of additive genetic variance in a population tightly depends on allele frequencies. typically, when allele frequencies are distributed towards extreme values, as predicted by the the neutral mutation model  <cit> , most of the genetic variance within population is expected to be additive regardless of existing dominance and epistatic interactions  <cit> . in other words rare variants affect less the additive variance than the non-additive variance.

sustainability of the response to selection depends on how the additive variance changes through time. it is affected by multiple factors, the number, the frequency, and the effect of each allele influencing the trait  <cit>  together with the interactions introduced by epistasis  <cit> , the correlations induced by linkage disequilibrium  <cit> , the strength of selection, the rate of occurrence and distribution of new mutations  <cit> , and the strength of random genetic drift  <cit> . unfortunately because of allele segregation at meiosis, changes in mean and variance components can not be resolved analytically even in the simplest case of one population submitted to directional selection on a single trait  <cit> . additional assumptions are needed and various models have been proposed to predict long-term changes. the infinitesimal model - in which traits are governed by an infinite number of independent loci with small effects - predicts changes in trait value with negligible changes in allele frequencies and genetic variance  <cit> . in contrast, whenever the population size or the number of loci is finite, predictions include a decrease of genetic variance and of the response to selection until a steady state is reached, i.e. selection/mutation/drift equilibrium  <cit> . moreover, non-additive interactions generate long term measurable additive variance by small changes in allele frequencies and their underlying interactions, and corresponding changes in the response rate  <cit> . finally, genetic background changes in the presence of genotype by environment interactions  <cit>  may result in canalization, i.e. decreased variance around phenotypic optimum  <cit> . hence, one important feature of the dynamics of the response to selection is that non-additive interactions may have a significant impact in the long-term  <cit> .

divergent selection experiments on complex traits have contributed to dissect the determinants of the response to selection  <cit> . in plants, one of the best example is the illinois maize long-term selection experiment that has been conducted over  <dig> generations. initiated in  <dig>  this experiment aimed at selecting an open-pollinated variety for kernel protein and oil content in two directions, low and high value of each trait. the observed response to selection has been steady over time indicating no exhaustion of variability  <cit> . in flour beetles, continuous selection over  <dig> generations on pupa weight, starting from a heterogeneous background, has also resulted in constant increase of phenotypic value with a small decline in genetic variance. the maintenance of variability was best explained by the input of new mutations  <cit> , or perhaps new epimutations. in canola, the input of new variation have been measured by artificially selecting respiration intensity from a doubled haploid background for  <dig> generations  <cit> . the results revealed significant changes in respiration intensity pointing to the role of de novo epimutations. altogether these examples reinforce the idea that existing or de novo variability are not limiting factors when selecting for complex traits in eukaryotes.

but what are the mechanisms underlying the response to selection? access to genomic information offers exciting prospects to answer this question and unravel the genetic bases of phenotypic differentiation. so far, only few studies have assessed genome wide effects of long-term divergent selection in higher organisms. the first one, by  <cit>  reports the results of artificial selection for accelerated development on outbred populations of drosophila with population sizes of about  <dig> individuals and effective population sizes around  <dig>  <cit> . it found no evidence for fixation of unconditionally advantageous alleles after  <dig> generations. among other explanations,  <cit>  propose that fluctuations of selective coefficients over time may explain the observed pattern. in other words, selection would proceed via multiple alleles of small effects each contributing transiently to the fitness increase  <cit> . similar results were obtained from the analysis of the golden glow maize long-term selection population  <cit> :  <dig> generations of selection for increased number of ears per plant with an effective population size around  <dig> led to a >3-fold increase without allelic fixations but multiple instances of soft sweeps. in contrast, the maize krug yellow dent long-term divergent seed-size selection experiment resulted in a combination of soft and hard sweeps associated with the fixation of alleles of opposite effects clustered in two genomic regions  <cit> . this experiment was conducted with similar demographic size as  <cit>  but slightly lower effective population size . interestingly, genomic regions that responded to selection did not overlap with qtls for seed weight detected in association studies. genome-wide study of allele frequency changes have also been performed in the virginia chicken lines experiment in which selection was applied bi-directionally on body weight for  <dig> generations  <cit>  with an effective population size around  <dig>  this study revealed dramatic effects of selection along the genome with multiple instances of complete sweeps whereby alternative alleles were fixed within the high- and low-weight population  <cit> . the reasons behind the differences observed between studies are unclear but may in part be explained by differences in effective population sizes with complete sweeps associated with smaller populations.

in this manuscript we describe phenotypic evolution of two independent divergent selection experiments  conducted during  <dig> generations from two maize inbred lines and investigate associated genetic changes in the first seven generations using genome-wide assessment of polymorphisms using both methyl-sensitive amplification polymorphisms  and amplified fragment length polymorphisms . the target trait of selection is flowering time. it is therefore fitness-related and encoded by numerous loci with around  <dig> quantitative trait loci  detected for female and male flowering  <cit> . the seven first generations of selection were described in a previous paper  <cit> . while the observed response is sustainable through time in all populations, we found only dozens of segregating polymorphisms in those initially nearly-fixed genetic backgrounds. all were present at the start of the experiments as residual heterozygosity. linkage and association mapping within our experimental setting reveal significant effects of tightly-linked markers. we discuss our findings from a somehow provocative perspective of missing polymorphisms that parallels previous debates on missing heritability.

RESULTS
description of the dsesâ€™ experiment
we conducted  <dig> independent dses for flowering time from  <dig> commercial maize inbred lines, f <dig> and mbs <dig> . as a result we obtained for each dse two derived populations of early- and late-flowering progenitors  previously identified as early f <dig>  late f <dig>  early mbs, late mbs  <cit> . within each dse, selected plants were selfed at each generation. we traced back the f <dig> and mbs pedigrees from generation  <dig>  to the start of the dses   with a special emphasis on generation g <dig> to compare with our previous results published in  <cit> . at generation g <dig>  pedigrees of late and early populations each encompassed two families, named respectively fe <dig>  fe <dig>  fl <dig> , fl <dig>  for early and late f <dig>  and me <dig>  me <dig>  ml <dig>  and ml <dig> for early and late mbs. the families me <dig>  me <dig>  ml <dig> and ml <dig> are independent and derived from  <dig> different ancestors at generation g <dig> chosen within the initial mbs seed lot. note that at generation g <dig>  the late mbs population also encompassed a third independent family named ml <dig>  that derived from another independent ancestor at generation g <dig>  within the f <dig> dse, there was  <dig> independent families at generation g <dig> named fe <dig>  fe <dig>  fl <dig> and fl <dig>  derived from  <dig> different ancestors at generation g <dig> chosen within the initial f <dig> seed lot. fl <dig> became extinct at generation g <dig> . generation g <dig> therefore encompasses  <dig> subfamilies fl <dig>  and fl <dig>  derived from two lineages of fl <dig> that splitted from a single progenitor selected at generation g <dig>  altogether, the two dses are represented by  <dig> families  evolving throughout the pedigrees.

selection responses over sixteen generations
at each generation, progenitor flowering dates were recorded as the  <dig> earliest or latest plants in their progeny for early and late progenitors respectively. we used these records to investigate the response to selection treating each family independently. the response was corrected by the year effect using yearly phenotypic records from the parental inbred lines as control. comparisons between dses were achieved by centering around the average value at generation g <dig> in f <dig> and mbs populations, and standardizing by the corresponding residual deviation of the control.

we observed a significant and sustained response to selection during the first  <dig> generations  in all families with an average gain comprised between  <dig>  and  <dig>  and an average loss comprised between - <dig>  and - <dig>  degree days per generation . in the early populations, response was similar in both genetic background, f <dig> or mbs . in the late populations, all mbs and f252-derived families exhibited a similar pattern  with a greater response to selection compared to early populations and less variation among generations  for ml <dig> et fl <dig>  fl <dig> was particularly noteworthy. it exhibited the greatest increase in the response to selection  and corresponded to the previously described late-vl f <dig>  while fl <dig> corresponded to late-nvl f <dig>   <cit> .

the response to selection was analyzed separately in each family from progenitor phenotypic data after correction for block and year effects. response  is measured as the slope of the linear regression of flowering date  on generations of selection . df is the number of degrees of freedom. note that variation between families mainly denotes variations in the number of progenitors. stde is the standard error for the response, and r
 <dig> the adjusted r-squared of the regression model. broad-sense heritability  was estimated at each generation as the ratio of the variance between progenitors belonging to the same family on the total phenotypic variance



the pattern observed from g <dig> through g <dig> was different. early populations continued to respond to selection with an average loss comprised between - <dig>  and - <dig>  degree-days per generation  that was similar accross genetic backgrounds, but lower than from g <dig> to g <dig> . late populations instead ceased to respond to selection except for fl <dig>  and ml <dig> . progenitors from the fl <dig> family were discarded from the experiment at g <dig> because the plants flowered too late in the season to produce viable offspring. in all other late families, the variation between generations was much higher than the average response . as exemplified by the fl <dig>  and fl <dig>  families, the response varied across generations alternating positive and negative slopes .

altogether, the response to selection was asymmetrical. in the early populations, the response was weaker but almost linear throughout the experiment. in contrast in late populations, the response was strong at the beginning and almost ceased after g <dig> except for fl <dig> and ml <dig>  to test whether the lack of response to selection for lateness were due to the exhaustion of genetic variability within families, we measured the genetic variation between progenitors of the same family over generations. statistics for the so-called within family broad-sense heritability  are given in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  there were on average  <dig> different progenitors within each family each year. a value of h <dig> significantly different from zero indicates significant differences between progenitor genotypic means with regard to the residual variation between plants from the same progenitor. although heritability medians were relatively low, ranging between median= <dig>  and median= <dig> , heritabilities significantly differed from zero in all families in at least one generation > <dig>  table  <dig> and 2). this corresponded to bursts of genetic variation resulting in a l-shaped distribution of h <dig> across generations and families  and high values for the maximal h <dig> within families, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . it is remarkable that there was a tendency for the median of h <dig> to be higher between generations g <dig> and g <dig> than between generations g <dig> and g <dig> . note that transcient increase of h <dig> is expected from fixation of initial polymorphisms in selfing populations. starting from an heterozygote, the variance between progenitors is expected to increase, and the variance within progenitor is expected to decrease due to selfing  <cit> . overall, our observations indicated no significant decrease in genetic variance neither within early nor within late families. hence, decrease in genetic variance cannot account for the lack of response to selection between g <dig> and g <dig> in the fl <dig> , fl <dig> , ml <dig>  ml <dig> families. at generations g <dig> and g <dig>  we performed flowering time measurements for all plants and compared them with the average flowering time of progenitors selected to form g <dig> and g <dig> . it confirmed that there was significant variation both between and within progenitors, even within the late families. however, selection was inefficient because the most extreme plants i.e. the latest, did not contribute to g <dig> and g <dig>  this was due to their reduced fertility in our environmental conditions.

altogether, we observed a significant response to selection in both directions during the first  <dig> generations of selection. in the early families, the response was linear through  <dig> generations of selection and sustained by a constant input of additive genetic variance within families. in contrast, selection has likely reached physiological limits in late families after generation g <dig> since we verified the maintenance of genetic variation within each family.

markers discriminate early and late families
in order to assess the genetic and epigenetic determinants of the response to selection, we combined both methyl-sensitive amplification polymorphisms  and amplified fragment length polymorphisms  to genotype all progenitors selected during the first  <dig> generations. both techniques are commonly used for genome-wide polymorphism detection because they are extremely cost-effective, they generate a large amount of markers, and display a strong discrimination power at low taxonomic level such as strain/inbred material  <cit> . the main drawback of aflps is to be dominant markers. however in our case, genealogical information facilitates genotype calling. we developed a likelihood framework to infer genotypes from aflp phenotypes and explicitely accounted for pedigree information and various sources of experimental errors .

given the highly inbred material used to start our dses, we expected a restricted number of markers. in maize inbred lines, the nucleotide residual heterozygosity is classically estimated at few percents  <cit>  with variations along the genome  <cit> . in our material, the sustainability of the response to selection clearly indicated a substantial amount of segregating polymorphisms either from standing genetic variation or from de novo mutations that occurred during the course of the experiment  <cit> . using  <dig> and  <dig> primer combinations for f <dig> and mbs dses respectively, we identified  <dig> markers segregating in f <dig>  and only  <dig> in mbs . within the f <dig> dse,  <dig> polymorphisms were methylation-based polymorphisms while  <dig> were either sequence-based or located in a methylated region . within the mbs dse,  <dig> were methylation-based polymorphisms . all markers were present in the initial seed lots as residual heterozygosity. some markers,  <dig> out of  <dig> and  <dig> out of  <dig>  segregated both in early and late populations respectively, while the remaining  only segregated within one population. in all families, the initial heterozygosity decreased at a rate that was not different from . as a result, all progenitors were homozygous for one or the other allele at each locus at generation g <dig>  the dataset was complemented with information from the previously obtained pcr marker at locus eif-4a associated with variation of flowering time  <cit> .

while scarce, markers offered a surprisingly high discrimination power. discriminant analyses indeed revealed that  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the variation between families was explained by the two first axes with different types of markers equally contributing to their definition . in f <dig>  the first axis discriminated all  <dig> families, the early fe <dig>  fe <dig> from the late fl <dig>  fl <dig> while the second axis essentially distinguished the  <dig> early families. in mbs, the first axis discriminated the early from the late population while the second axis discriminated the late families, the early families being indistinguishable. those results were confirmed by an analysis of molecular variance on allele frequencies  <cit> . in f <dig>   <dig> %  of the variance was observed between late and early populations, and  <dig> %  between families within populations. in mbs,  <dig> %  of the variance was between populations and  <dig> %  between families within populations. therefore variance among families within populations was consistently smaller than variance among populations. such pattern is unexpected under a pure drift model.

to summarize, all the markers found were present as residual heterozygosity in the initial inbred lines. they corresponded to sequence as well as to methylation polymorphisms and discriminated late from early populations. in other words, independently derived families within populations more often fixed the same alleles than families from different populations. our results therefore advocate for a dominant role of selection over drift despite small effective population sizes.

association and linkage mapping reveal a dearth of causal polymophisms
we calculated the linkage disequilibrium between the markers associated with flowering time with the purpose of clustering and ordering them in linkage groups. we found  <dig> distinct linkage groups for f <dig> and two for mbs . among the  <dig> f <dig> linkage groups, one contained  <dig> markers clustered in a region bearing the gene eif-4a associated with flowering time variation both within the f <dig> pedigrees and a large panel of maize inbred lines  <cit> .

for each marker, we measured its additive and dominant effect using flowering data gathered along pedigrees. we assessed its significance using gene dropping simulations, thereby explicitly accounting for pedigree information. in f <dig> populations, among  <dig> markers,  <dig> exhibited a significant additive effect while none displayed a dominant effect. among the  <dig> significant markers,  <dig> discriminated late versus early populations, but also early or late families. altogether,  <dig> markers had a significant effect within early populations,  <dig> had a significant effect within late populations, and one was significant both within early and within late populations . the magnitude of effects changes between the late and the early populations. it was below  <dig> degree-days within early but above  <dig> within late . consistently, the percentage of variance explained by the markers was greater within late  than within early  populations. this observation was consistent with a greater response within the late families ml <dig> and fl <dig> compared with the early during the  <dig> first generations of selection . note that most significant associations  corresponded to markers from the same linkage group which also contains the eif-4a gene. in mbs populations, among  <dig> markers, a subset of  <dig> exhibited a significant additive effect  with a range of magnitude comparable to what we reported for f <dig> from  <dig> degree days up to  <dig> degree days . note the elevated r <dig> value observed for marker g <dig> 

to illustrate the results, some examples of the segregation of alleles and association with flowering time are shown for  <dig> markers from f <dig> and mbs respectively . markers a <dig> and b <dig> were polymorphic within both early and late f <dig> populations. for marker a <dig>  the loss of the band in the fl <dig> family was associated with very late flowering time, while it had no apparent effect in the early families. for marker b <dig>  the presence of the band was associated with lateness in both early and late families. consistently, the band had been lost during the selection process in most early progenitors. in the mbs dse, the presence of the band at marker g <dig> was strongly associated with earliness. except for generations g <dig> and g <dig>  this marker perfectly discriminated the early  and late  families. marker g <dig> exhibited a similar pattern but the presence of the band was associated with lateness. the band had been lost as soon as generation g <dig> in the early families while it still segregated in the late families.

when computed on the subset of markers that were found significantly associated with flowering time variation, the analysis of molecular variance revealed an increase of the between-population variance and a corresponding decrease of the within-family residual variance. in f <dig> dse,  <dig> %  of the variance was observed between late and early populations, and  <dig> %  between families within populations. in mbs,  <dig> %  of the variance was observed between populations and  <dig> %  between families within populations. hence, marker segregation matched the direction of selection, the loss of polymorphism being faster within families for markers associated with flowering time variation.

altogether, our results demonstrated that about one third of the markers were associated with differences in flowering time. despite the fact that the families were derived independently, marker segregation depended on the direction of selection, and ultimately discriminated late from early populations irrespective of the family. within f <dig> dse, all markers associated with flowering time variation but two exhibited tight linkage with the eif-4a gene.

discussion
our ongoing divergent selection experiments  from two maize inbred lines with flowering time as target trait have now been conducted for  <dig> years. we presented here the results obtained from generations g <dig> to g <dig>  altogether, we observed a significant response to selection in both directions that is comparable for the two dses and similar to the ones classically observed for dses in several respects. first, the phenotypic mean was driven several times the standard residual deviation away from its starting value . second, response to selection was asymmetrical and depended on the direction of selection. third, we observed fast fixation of initial polymorphisms. large response to selection is a common outcome of selection experiments that target a single trait  <cit>  such as flowering time in our design.

the late populations responded initially better to selection than the early ones. it can be explained by directional epistasis, as expected for traits with a complex genetic architecture  <cit> . note that the two initial inbreds f <dig> and mbs are early-flowering and adapted to temperate regions. as such, both have been submitted to intense selection for earliness and new mutations occuring in a background of coadapted early alleles are more likely to perturb existing combinations and to result in a late phenotype. in addition to the initial asymmetry between late and early populations, some late populations displayed a plateau after generation g <dig> while early populations continued to respond to selection over time. under our northern european climate, late genotypes may be more prone to reach physiological limitations resulting in less efficient selection. this is precisely what we observed. after several generations of selection, the latest genotypes flowered so late that they were not able to produce mature seeds before the end of the season so that the contributors to the next generation were early plants within the late populations. therefore, the lack of response to selection observed within the late populations in the second part of our experiment, from g <dig> to g <dig> reflects our lack of success to select for lateness. such limits are common in dses and have been observed for example in mice body weight  <cit>  and for maize protein and oil content  <cit> .

just as reported for dses conducted in other systems  <cit> , hard sweeps  <cit>  were observed between generations g <dig> and g <dig>  given our extremely small effective population size within families, this was expected. for example, the band for marker a <dig> was lost for all progenitors of the fl <dig> family as soon as generation g <dig> . the same kind of pattern was observed for a couple of markers in strong ld with the eif-4a gene. interestingly, we previously proposed  <cit>  that a cluster of tightly-linked genes including eif-4a contribute to pleiotropic effects on plant height and leaf number in addition to flowering time. such hypothesis is consistent with the pronounced pattern of linkage disequilibrium that we report here in this region . note however that a strong ld pattern is also expected from selfing in small populations. hence we did not merely observe causal relationships between marker polymorphims and flowering time, but rather the effect of selection at the genome-wide scale.

estimates from the genome-wide genotyping of parent lines f <dig> and mbs with the 50k maize snp microarray  <cit>  revealed a residual heterozygosity of about  <dig>  % for f <dig>  and  <dig>  % for mbs over  <dig>  snps mainly concentrated in genic regions. our starting material was therefore characterized by a narrow genetic basis, even though our estimates are likely biased downards by undetected residual heterozygosity in gene-poor portions of the genome such as pericentromeric regions  <cit> . with our molecular data we confirmed the greater variation of the f <dig> inbred, as compared with mbs . despite such a narrow genetic basis, standing variation for flowering time contributed to the response to selection. consistently, we found a significant genetic variance component in f <dig> populations derived from crosses between one early- and one late-flowering plant from the initial f <dig> and mbs seed lots . in f <dig>  the measured genetic variance was similar to the one measured in an f <dig> population derived from a cross between an early and a late progenitor at generation g <dig>  while in mbs, it was about half. considering that close to a hundred flowering time qtls have been reported in maize  <cit> , we would expect residual allelic variation for at most  <dig> of them in f <dig> and between zero and one in mbs. it is therefore remarkable that with so few initial genetic polymorphisms, phenotypic differences between early and late families reached around  <dig> degree days within  <dig> generations of selection, a range of variation comparable with the observed range of hybrids cultivated under northern european conditions. moreover, while mbs was initially an order of magnitude less polymorphic than f <dig>  the measured phenotypic response to selection was similar in f <dig> and mbs populations . hence, residual heterozygosity of the initial inbreds can only partly explain the fast response to selection observed during the first generations in our dses.

while aflps markers are dominant and therefore not applicable to detect heterozygosity, our likelihood model relies on pedigree information to infer both homozygous and heterozygous genotypes. using this framework, we observed a loss of initial polymorphism within a few generations at a rate in line with neutral predictions . at g <dig>  average heterozygote frequency has decreased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in mbs and  <dig>  in f <dig>  at g <dig>  all progenitors were homozygous for all markers. this finding is consistent with previous simulation results  <cit> . while we cannot exclude the role of initial polymorphisms in the response to selection , our data indicate that initial polymorphisms are lost at the expected rate of one half per generation. sources of polymorphism other than standing variation must therefore have contributed to sustain selection during  <dig> generations.

we did not identify new genetic or epigenetic variants in our setting while we expect roughly  <dig> of them per population within the gene space . we hence reached a paradox with on one hand, the maintenance of heritable phenotypic variation , and on the other hand, no evidence of new variation. in other words, we observed in our dses a dearth of polymorphisms associated with a sustained response to selection for flowering time. we propose two hypotheses to resolve this conflicting pattern: either we were not able to detect mutations that occured during the course of our experiment using our aflp/m-sap assays; or the the number of mutations was indeed low and maintenance of heritable variation through time is ensured by â€˜conversionâ€™ of epistatic variance  to additive variance  <cit> .

apparent lack of polymorphism could be an artefact of our technical choices and methods. first aflps and m-saps only reveal a sample of existing polymorphisms  and are non randomly distributed. they tend to cluster in non recombining regions  <cit> . whether these regions are less likely to reveal de novo mutations is however questionable. alternatively, the observed phenotypic variation may merely be sustained by unstable changes in dna methylation status that we were unable to detect. indeed, our method to reconstruct aflp/m-sap genotypes from the band patterns  and the pedigrees was fairly stringent. polymorphisms that appeared in one progenitor without being mendelian transmitted to its offspring were typically counfounded with experimental errors and discarded. note that even if those polymorphisms had been considered, it would have been impossible to test their association with flowering time variation because of lack of power. however when referring to the litterature, we overall expect a limited contribution of unstable methylation changes to phenotypic changes. indeed, studies in maize have revealed that the vast majority of differentially methylated regions including pure epigenetic variants are mostly mendelian inherited  <cit> . finally, we must keep in mind that m-sap methodology only reveals dna methylation polymorphisms and not histone methylation polymorphisms. the former have been associated with quantitative variation of traits in arabidopsis thaliana including flowering  <cit> , and results suggest that the latter may be an important determinant of natural variation  <cit> . along the same line, our methodology did not allow detection of structural variation caused by the insertion-deletion of transposable elements. such elements are known to be important contributors of phenotypic variation in crops  <cit> .

alternatively, conversion of epistatic to additive variance could explain the significance of the response to selection through time even with a limited number of mutations. this "make a lot with few" hypothesis relies on the process of fixation of initial polymorphisms and the fact that subtle within-family genetic background changes may reveal cryptic genetic variation  <cit> . there are two possible mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. first, a loss-of-function mutation in a canalization gene can reveal hidden genetic or phenotypic variation, like mutations in the chaperone protein hsp <dig>  <cit> . second, a mutation introduced in different genetic backgrounds can reveal epistatic effects of the background that range from complete suppression to enhancement of the mutant phenotype, as evidenced in drosophila for several mutations in homeotic genes  but also in maize for the tb <dig> mutation that control branching during early development  <cit> . interestingly, just like some examples above concern developmental genes, we found that flowering time variation in our dses was intimately linked with changes in the timing of floral transition  <cit> , a shift determined during early maize development. strong epistatic variations hidden at a population level but revealed by a combination of strong drift and selection in our experimental setting may explain elevated mutational variance  <cit>  as compared with more traditional settings  <cit> . our aflp/m-sap assays clearly present limitations in the detection of new mutations. only genome-wide exploration of mutations and epimutations using high throughput technologies will offer enough power to distinguish between those two explanations for the lack of polymorphism found in our dses.

CONCLUSIONS
we describe here two experiments that consisted in  <dig> generations of divergent selection for flowering time in maize, starting from a single inbred line seed lot. we observed a sustained response to selection in both directions. in the late populations a physiological limit was reached within a few generations, but we showed evidence for the maintenance of heritable genetic variation. residual heterozygosity in the initial inbreds can partly explain the observed responses as evidenced by m-sap and aflp markers. their allelic segregation throughout the dsesâ€™ pedigrees indeed revealed a strong association with flowering time variation. their fast fixation resulted in the emergence of strong genetic differentiation between the early and the late populations. during the first  <dig> generations, we found no evidence of new polymorphisms arisen by mutation. whether unexplored sources of polymorphism or strong epistatic interactions account for the observed dearth of polymorphism remains an unresolved issue that will deserve further investigations. altogether we produced a material of choice to study the effects of those mutations. after  <dig> generations of selection, we produced sets of phenotypically differentiated genotypes that share a common genetic background inherited from the inbred parent. the challenge now will be to decipher differences in the developmental sequence that were targeted by selection to modify flowering time.
