BACKGROUND
neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses  comprise a group of recessively inherited neurodegenerative disorders of which the infantile form, incl, is the most severe  <cit> . clinical symptoms include motor and cognitive deterioration, visual failure, and seizures, leading to death in the first or second decade of life. pathological findings include autofluorescent lysosomal storage material, harbouring an ultrastructure of granular osmiophilic deposits  in all tissues of the patients  <cit> . while most cell types remain unaffected despite the presence of storage material, cortical neurons are lost during the disease process. however, the mechanism of cell death has remained elusive.

the defective gene behind the incl disease, cln <dig>  encodes for palmitoyl protein thioesterase  <dig>   <cit> . it consists of  <dig> amino acids, including a signal sequence of  <dig> amino acids and three n-linked glycosylation sites. the enzyme is transported into lysosomes of non-neuronal cells by the mannose 6-phosphate receptor  mediated pathway  <cit> . in mouse cortical neuron cultures, ppt <dig> is axonally targeted and colocalizes with presynaptic markers. furthermore, immunoelectron microscopy and cell fractionation studies have shown that neuronal ppt <dig> is also found in synaptosomes and synaptic vesicles  <cit>  suggesting an additional function for ppt <dig> outside of lysosomes. in vitro- studies have shown that ppt <dig> depalmitoylates s-acylated proteins, but its native substrates have remained unknown  <cit> . palmitoylation has been shown to play a critical role particularly in neurons, where active vesicular transport and intracellular signalling take place .

to date,  <dig> disease-causing mutations have been described in the cln <dig> gene  <cit> . although the disease is classified as an infantile form of ncl, the age of onset varies depending on the mutation: nonsense and frameshift mutations always induce the classical infantile disease, whereas some missense mutations also associate with the adult-onset disease form in addition to infantile and juvenile forms  <cit> . as a result of the mutations, the activity of the ppt <dig> enzyme is either reduced or abolished, or the expression level of the protein is diminished  <cit> . the neuronal localization of ppt <dig> also varies depending on the disease phenotype: mutations contributing to a severe infantile disease caused the retention of the enzyme in the er, whereas the steady state localization of the proteins carrying a juvenile-onset disease mutation was reportedly unaffected  <cit> . however, this observation could not be repeated in non-neuronal cells, where all the mutant polypeptides were retained in the er. in general, the accumulation of mutant protein in the er is not considered to affect the phenotype  <cit> , although this has not been studied in incl.

even though some aspects of the glycosylation of ppt <dig> have been studied previously  <cit> , we wanted to further analyze the effects of its three n-glycosylation sites on the activity, and especially the trafficking of ppt <dig>  an aspect not covered previously. contrary to earlier studies, our results show that glycosylation at n <dig> and n <dig> is essential for ppt1's activity. we also show that the same two glycosylation sites are needed for correct lysosomal targeting of ppt <dig>  in this study, we also demonstrate that ppt <dig> self-oligomerizes in vivo. interestingly, we show that ppt <dig> expressed in neurons is differentially modified when compared with non-neuronal ppt <dig>  furthermore, ppt1's distribution in antibody internalization assay was different when compared to a classical lysosomal enzyme aga, suggesting that ppt <dig> behaves differently from the enzymes using mannose 6-phosphate pathway for their endocytosis. this study reveals new properties of the neuronal ppt <dig>  possibly explaining the vast differences observed in the cln1-pathogenesis in different cell types.

RESULTS
the effects of n-glycosylation on the activity and transport of ppt1
ppt <dig> has three n-glycosylation sites at amino acid positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and in each of them at least one n-acetylglucosamine residue is present in the crystal structure  <cit> . glycosylation results in four forms of overexpressed ppt <dig> which can be detected as a  <dig> kda non-glycosylated form and as  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kda mono-, di- and triglycosylated forms in cos- <dig> cells  <cit> . mutations in glycosylation sites of ppt <dig> have been shown to affect protein folding and degradation, enzymatic activity, lysosomal sorting, and transport  <cit> . in our study, we mutagenized the serines to alanines in each ppt <dig> n-glycosylation consensus site  since substitution of serine in the motif supposedly causes only minimal distortion to the polypeptide structure  <cit> . the mutagenized ppt <dig> constructs, s199a, s214a, and s234a as well as the double-mutant construct s199a + s214a were transfected into cos- <dig> and hela cells and analyzed for activity, processing, and intracellular localization. the activities of the glycosylation mutants were calculated from cell lysates normalized to transfection efficiency. the results demonstrated that the polypeptide carrying the s214a mutant presented relatively high enzyme activity , whereas the polypeptides carrying s199a or s234a substitutions showed severely reduced activities, on average 1–5% of normal activity . the ppt <dig> polypeptide carrying a double mutation at the glycosylation sites s199a and s214a, also expressed very low enzyme activity. the intracellular processing of the glycosylation mutants was analyzed by metabolic labelling and immunoprecipitation. after a one-hour pulse followed by a 2-hour chase, the mature wild-type ppt <dig> was detected as a doublet of 36/ <dig> kda both in the cells and the media . ppt <dig> carrying glycosylation site mutations s199a and s234a was detected as doublets and s214a as a major single band, suggesting that both of the remaining glycosylation sites are effectively used in the case of this mutant. the s214a polypeptide was also secreted into the culture media, demonstrating that this protein was able to pass the quality control system of the er for secretion. ppt <dig> carrying the s234a mutation was secreted into the culture media in low yields, while s199a and s199a + s214a – mutants were fully non-secretory, suggesting that they mostly retain in the er. thus, the current analysis suggests that the n-glycosylation at asparagine  <dig> is not crucial for ppt <dig> activity or folding. earlier studies have shown that ppt <dig> with a single mutation at any of the three possible glycosylation sites is still capable of obtaining a mannose-6-phosphate  tag on its sugar structures and binding to m6p-receptor  <cit> . das and co-workers have shown that the n232q mutation in ppt <dig> has the greatest effect on m6p-receptor binding. therefore, we also analyzed the intracellular localization of the glycosylation mutated proteins in transfected cos- <dig> cells by immunofluorescence analysis. as suggested by the enzyme activity measurements, ppt <dig> carrying the s214a mutation was transported to lysosomes whereas the s199a – mutant was retained in the er. mutant s234a showed partial localization to lysosomes, although a major proportion was retained in the er . the data indicate that the n-glycosylation of asparagines  <dig> and  <dig> is more important for ppt <dig> structure, transport, and function than the n-glycosylation of n <dig> 

glycosylation and transport of ppt <dig> in non-neuronal versus neuronal cells
several studies have suggested an extralysosomal localization of ppt <dig> in neuronal cells  <cit> , implicating neuron specific properties for ppt <dig>  to approach this question, we overexpressed ppt <dig> both in mouse fibroblasts and neurons and compared the apparent molecular weights of non-neuronal and neuronal ppt <dig>  western blot analysis showed that in mouse fibroblasts all three glycosylation forms of ppt <dig> were present, the diglycosylated form being the most prominent. in neurons, however, only two glycosylation forms could be detected . another interesting observation was that ppt <dig> overexpressed in neuronal cells migrated differently in a sds-gel than ppt <dig> produced in mouse fibroblasts. two neuronal bands focused in the spaces in between the three bands from fibroblasts, rather than at the same level with them. to investigate the reason for this, we treated both samples with pngasef to remove all the n-glycans. repeated western blot analyses revealed that deglycosylation results in two ppt <dig> bands in fibroblasts while only one band is seen for neurons . also the deglycosylated polypeptides differed in their size, the neuronal band again migrating in between the two bands from fibroblasts rather than at the same level with one of them. this result suggests that in addition to n-glycosylation, ppt <dig> contains other cell type specific modifications.

we further analyzed the possible disparity in neuronal transport of ppt <dig> and utilized an antibody internalization assay to compare recycling of ppt <dig> between non-neuronal and neuronal cells. mouse fibroblasts and primary neuronal cultures were infected with recombinant adenoviruses encoding ppt <dig> and a control cdna, aspartyglucosaminidase . aga is a well characterized, classic lysosomal enzyme that has been shown to utilize the m6pr-mediated lysosomal transport and endocytosis also in neurons  <cit> . as expected, both ppt <dig> and aga antibodies were internalized in adenovirus-infected mouse fibroblasts. however, the distribution pattern of the internalized antibody was different. both aga and ppt <dig> localized in vesicular structures, but while aga localized to perinuclear vesicles, ppt <dig> was scattered throughout the cell in smaller structures . aga showed colocalization with the lysosomal marker lamp- <dig> , while only a small fraction of ppt <dig> was localized to lysosomes . when the same experiment was repeated in neurons, again a clear difference between ppt <dig> and aga antibody internalization was observed. ppt <dig> staining was similar to that seen in the fibroblasts. small vesicles could be found everywhere in the cell, although the staining was particularly strong in the axons. aga staining was again strongest in the cell soma, typical of its late endosomal/lysosomal localization  <cit>  and only a few aga-positive vesicles could be seen in the neuronal projections . this observation suggests that the transport of recycled ppt <dig> from the plasma membrane back inside the cell differs from that of aga in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells.

self-oligomerization of ppt1
although the crystal structure of the ppt <dig> molecule is established, very little is currently known about the biological interactions and the molecular structural format of ppt <dig> in vivo. therefore, we used superose 6hr size-exclusion chromatography on cell lysates to determine whether the intracellular ppt <dig> resides in a monomeric or a complex form. as ppt <dig> has been categorized as a lysosomal enzyme, we used a subcellular lysosome-containing fraction of pc <dig> cells as the ppt <dig> source. the undifferentiated pc <dig> cells were selected because their endogenous ppt <dig> levels are high enough for reliable activity measurements. cell samples were filtrated and fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography. enzyme activities of both ppt <dig> and aga were measured from the elution fractions. aga participates in glycoprotein breakdown by catalyzing the cleavage of the n-glycosidic bond between asparagine and n-acetylglucosamine  <cit> . under native conditions, aga exists as a dimer   <cit> . aga activity was eluted in a fraction corresponding with the molecular size of a native aga homodimer . interestingly, the activity of ppt <dig> distributed more broadly between the elution fractions. a considerable amount of the ppt <dig> enzyme activity was demonstrated in the fractions representing apparent mw >  <dig> kda. another ppt <dig> activity peak was observed in fractions that most probably represent the monomeric form  of the enzyme . this result indicates that a significant amount of native ppt <dig> resides in a complex rather than in a monomeric form.

to further investigate the observed in vivo complex formation of ppt <dig>  we analyzed the possible self-oligomerization of ppt <dig> by using co-immunoprecipitation assays. cos- <dig> cells were double transfected with both gfp-ppt <dig> fusion protein and wild type ppt <dig> constructs. transfected cells were then lysed and co-immunoprecipitated with anti-gfp-agarose beads. western blot analysis of the co-immunoprecipitates, detected by ppt <dig> antibody, showed that both the wild type ppt <dig> and the gfp-ppt <dig> were present, indicating that gfp-ppt <dig> and ppt <dig> interacted with each other . as controls, we used gfp-cln <dig> and gfp-aire fusion proteins  <cit> . cln <dig> is another ncl protein behind the juvenile form of the disease, shown to be localized to endosomes and lysosomes  <cit> . aire is a nuclear protein participating in t-cell maturation. ppt <dig> did not co-precipitate with either of these fusion proteins .

to distinguish whether the self-interaction of ppt <dig> molecules was direct or mediated by other factors, we also performed a direct interaction assay for purified ppt <dig>  recombinant ppt <dig> was purified from the stably transfected cho-cells  <cit>  by the method modified from bellizzi et al  <cit> . the purified enzyme was then used to analyze direct dimerization of ppt <dig> in a plasmon resonance energy transfer assay using biacore application. however, the results of the biacore analysis showed that purified ppt <dig> was not capable of interacting with itself under these in vitro conditions  suggesting that other as of yet unknown factors mediate the subcellular complex formation of ppt <dig> 

effects of disease mutations on the properties of ppt1
mutations in ppt <dig> have been shown to result in disease with variable age of onset and progression. previous studies have reported some correlation between the disease mutation phenotype and the localization of ppt <dig>  <cit> . also the effects of known missense mutations on ppt <dig> activity have previously been explored  <cit> , but the g108r mutation resulting in an adult phenotype has not been examined in an overexpressing system  <cit> . therefore we analyzed the activity of ppt <dig> carrying g108r and included two other mutants in the analysis, namely m1i  and r122w, also denoted as pptfin, , the latter as a known inactive control. the activities of the wild type and mutant enzymes were analyzed in transiently transfected cos- <dig> cells and the data were normalized by immunoblotting and densitometric scanning for the expression level of ppt <dig> . the initiator codon mutation m1i resulted in the enzyme displaying a nearly full activity but reduced expression. in contrast, the adult onset mutation g108r showed approximately 4% activity compared with that of the wild type enzyme. as a control, pptfin was lacking the enzyme activity completely.

the subcellular localization of mutated ppt <dig> has been shown to vary, depending on the cell type and on the type of mutation  <cit> . we used immunofluorescence staining in transiently transfected hela cells and recombinant sfv-infected mouse primary neurons to further map previously unknown intracellular localizations of mutant proteins m1i and g108r. in transfected hela cells, double staining together with the late endosomal/lysosomal marker lamp <dig> showed that the wild type protein reached the lysosomes, as did the m1i mutant . this confirms that the initiator codon mutation m1i  results only in a reduced expression level of ppt <dig> and does not affect the natural intracellular transport of the protein from er to lysosomes. ppt <dig> polypeptides carrying the g108r  mutation were retained in the er and showed a colocalization with the er marker protein pdi  , similarly to the classical infantile onset r122w mutation  serving as a control. as in hela cells, the distribution of the wild type and m1i enzymes was uniform also in neurons. they localized in the projections of the cells, partially colocalizing with the synaptic vesicle marker sv <dig> . ppt <dig> with the g108r mutation also displayed some staining in the neuron projections, but did not colocalize with sv <dig>  instead, it showed partial colocalization with the er-specific pdi. no overlap with the golgi marker or the lysosomal marker was detected . in conclusion, the g108r mutant causing the adult phenotype does not show significant activity in cos- <dig> cells and it is not transported similarly to the wild type enzyme in hela cells or mouse primary neurons. thus the activity or the localization was not able to explain the variability in the disease phenotype.

due to the observed difference in the glycosylation degree between neuronal and non-neuronal ppt <dig>  it was of interest to compare the glycosylation degree of the mutant and the wild type proteins in different cell types. we performed an immunoblot analysis from the lysates derived from both transfected cos- <dig> cells and sfv-infected neurons. the g108r and ppt1fin -mutants harbouring an amino acid substitution in the middle of the polypeptide chain, and thus likely to have disturbances in their folding, presented mostly the tri- and diglycosylated forms of the protein in cos- <dig> cells . notably, no differences could be seen in the glycosylation levels between the mutant proteins causing late or early onset phenotypes. in the case of the ppt1fin and g108r -mutated proteins, the amount of the triglycosylated protein was increased when compared to wild type and m1i-mutated proteins , indicating that in total, the glycosylation degree of the mutants was higher than that of the wild type enzyme or the m1i mutated enzyme . in neurons, this observation was repeated with even greater differences between the mutants and the wild type protein . the enzymes with a higher degree of n-glycosylation were the most prominent ones among the mutants, including m1i, unlike in the wild type ppt <dig>  where a lower degree of glycosylation was evident.

to investigate the possible role of mutations in the ability of ppt <dig> to form complexes, four different mutations, each causing a different phenotype, were selected for gfp-pull down analyses: r122w , f85del , l219q , and g108r  . to create conditions that mimic a homomeric interaction, we mutagenized both the gfp-ppt <dig> and ppt <dig> constructs. after co-immunoprecipitation with gfp-agarose and western blot detection with ppt <dig> antibody, we compared the extent of dimerization of the mutated polypeptides with that of the wild type proteins, taking into account the differences in the expression levels . the experiment was replicated several times, and although we could not quantitate the results repeatedly, the analyses demonstrated that all the mutated ppt <dig> polypeptides were able to form homodimeric complexes and that the interaction intensities between mutant proteins were somewhat stronger than those observed between wild type proteins . in summary, our data suggest that the mutated proteins utilize their glycosylation sites more efficiently than the wild type proteins in neurons as well as in other cell types studied here. they also show higher degree of oligomerization than the wild type molecules. however, neither of the described properties can be directly used to explain the variations in the disease onset age.

discussion
this study was launched to clarify the effects of glycosylation and complex formation on the properties of ppt <dig>  previously, the three n-glycosylation sites of ppt <dig> have been shown to be utilized in non-neuronal cells and their effect on ppt <dig> activity has been studied by mutagenizing the glycosylation site asparagines to glutamines  <cit> . single n → q mutations were reported to cause only minor effects on ppt <dig> activity, and double mutations resulted in a minimum of 20% activity. in this study, we utilized a different strategy for generating the glycosylation site mutations. rather than changing the specific asparagines to another amino acid, we altered the glycosylation site consensus sequence n-x-s/t by mutating serines to alanines. this was done to spare the polypeptide backbone and the side chains from any major distortions  <cit> . interestingly, our results differed significantly from the previous analyses. the activity of all the glycosylation site mutants was greatly reduced, and only the n <dig> glycosylation site mutant could retain a considerable enzyme activity. thus, our data implicates that glycosylation is important for ppt <dig> activity, and the most important site for it is n <dig>  followed by n <dig> and n <dig> 

it has been shown that the glycosylation of asparagine  <dig> has a fundamental role in the m6p-receptor binding and thus it was proposed to have an effect on the proper lysosomal transport of ppt <dig> in non-neuronal cells  <cit> . our studies on the intracellular transport of glycosylation site mutants did not confirm these conclusions. we investigated both intracellular and secreted ppt <dig> by immunoprecipitation and analyzed the localization of the enzyme by immunofluorescence. we showed that the same glycosylation mutations that affected the ppt <dig> enzyme activity also had the most severe impact on the transport of ppt <dig>  when the n <dig> glycosylation site was mutated, ppt <dig> was retained in the er, although the n <dig> glycosylation site – mostly involved in the m6p-receptor binding – was unaffected. when the n <dig> glycosylation site was mutated, ppt <dig> localized to the er – but also partially to lysosomes. the same mutant was also secreted into the media. thus, our data suggest that the role of m6p-receptor-mediated lysosomal trafficking might not be as crucial for ppt <dig> as it has previously been thought.

the relative inefficiency of gene therapy trials to treat incl suggests that the trafficking of ppt <dig> may have novel properties. m6p-receptor-mediated trafficking has offered a substantial advance to treat lysosomal storage disorders since most soluble lysosomal enzymes can diffuse in the brain tissue. for example, in glucoproteinoses, gene therapy and bone marrow transplantation have been advantageous in animal models and even in human studies, especially in cases where the m6pr-mediated trafficking of the lysosomal enzyme has been shown to operate in neurons  <cit> . however, the therapeutic studies in ppt1-deficient mice involving aav-mediated ppt <dig>  have ameliorated the cns pathology only in localized areas, suggesting that the neuronal trafficking of ppt <dig> has undefined features  <cit> . in this study, we could observe several new properties for neuronal ppt <dig>  including altered modification compared to ppt <dig> in fibroblasts. both of the cell types analyzed here were infected with the same recombinant ppt1-adenovirus  <cit>  including the human cdna, so it is unlikely that our finding would result from different splice variants. one could postulate that the glycosylation is actually similar in these cells, and that the differences seen in the number of the bands would result from some other modification. further studies are needed to clarify the precise nature of these modifications, but phosphorylation and lipid modifications could be potential study targets. with the antibody internalization assay, trafficking differences could be seen both in fibroblasts and neurons compared with another lysosomal enzyme aga, which is known to utilize the m6p-receptor. while the aga antibody was endocytosed into perinuclear lysosomes, the endocytosed ppt <dig> antibody only partially localized to lysosomes, mostly retaining in small vesicles distributed throughout the cell. we conclude that an increasing amount of evidence pinpoints the existence of an alternative pathway for ppt <dig> sorting in addition to the m6p-receptor-mediated route.

molecular interactions of several ncl proteins have been partially resolved. cln <dig> has been shown to interact with both cln <dig> and cln <dig>  <cit> . cln <dig>  the protein behind the variant late infantile ncl, was recently shown to form dimers in cross-linkage experiments  <cit> . however, so far the molecular interactions of ppt <dig> have not been analyzed in detail. our data suggest that ppt <dig> can homodimerize or oligomerize in vivo. both gfp-ppt <dig> and ppt <dig> proteins used in the co-immunoprecipitation assay are highly glycosylated. glycosylation usually prevents aggregation and thus the interaction is not likely to be due to a bias via aggregation of overexpressed protein. more importantly, the demonstration of the active enzyme in the large molecular weight fraction of the cell homogenate during the size-exclusion chromatography supports a true interaction between ppt <dig> molecules, either directly or via other molecules. ppt <dig> has been crystallized as a monomer from a secreted protein sample  <cit> . neither could we detect oligomerization in a secreted, monomeric sample. thus it is possible that the intracellular oligomerization of ppt <dig> involves other, yet unresolved molecules. the understanding of the physiological relevance of the oligomerization for the action of ppt <dig> also awaits further studies. interestingly however, we could detect that mutant ppt <dig> molecules show a higher degree of oligomerization. this may represent a means to regulate the activation and/or transport of the enzyme. for example, acyl protein thioesterase  <dig> , a functional relative for ppt <dig>  forms a dimer which has to dissociate before the enzyme displays activity  <cit> . this suggests that the dimer formation and dissociation may occur reversibly also in the case of ppt <dig> 

ppt <dig> activities of mutant proteins have been carefully analyzed earlier from transfected cos- <dig> cell lysates, purified protein samples and patient lymphoblasts  <cit> . while severe incl-mutations produced inactive enzymes, the mutations causing later onset disease showed low residual activity. however, it has not been possible to draw a straight correlation between the level of residual activity and the age of onset, since the late infantile and juvenile phenotype-causing mutations both possessed activities between  <dig> and 30% of the wild type enzyme. also in this study, the overexpressed ppt <dig> carrying the adult phenotype mutation g108r was shown to have only a low activity of  <dig> %. the activities of ppt1g108r have earlier been measured in patient fibroblasts and leukocytes and they were similar to those of patients with the early onset disease  <cit> . as the residual ppt <dig> enzyme activity of mutant proteins have not correlated with the disease phenotypes, previous studies have proposed that decreased enzyme stability plays a major role in determining the phenotype  <cit> . a late onset mutation m1i displayed almost full activity  as analyzed by overexpression in cos- <dig> cells. it has been proposed that the start codon ata would be utilized in the patients' tissues, resulting in low but clinically relevant expression of the normal enzyme  <cit> . our current observations support this suggestion, since also the intracellular localization of this mutant was uniform with wild type enzyme both in hela cells and neurons. it can be concluded that the enzyme activity level per se cannot be used to distinguish later onset diseases from each other.

in the current study we could not define the molecular basis for the adult phenotype caused by the g108r mutation. the g108r polypeptides fully colocalized with the er marker pdi in hela cells being well in line with earlier findings  <cit> . neuronal g108r was transported further to the extensions but did not colocalize with the presynaptic markers, the target for the wild type and m1i polypeptides. evidently ppt1g108r can delay the development of the disease until adulthood without reaching the synaptic vesicles. this may implicate that ppt <dig> has some functional roles along the secretary pathway. further research is needed to locate the place of action for neuronal ppt <dig> and to clarify the molecular networks affected by ppt <dig> deficiency.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we show that the n-glycosylation of asparagines  <dig> and  <dig> is important for ppt <dig> activity. we further describe the ability of ppt <dig> to form complexes. disease mutations resulting in a classic early onset or later onset forms of incl were shown to have an effect both on the glycosylation degree of ppt <dig> and its ability to form complexes, but neither of these phenomena could explain the genotype-phenotype correlation. the current study also demonstrates that intracellular transport and maturation of ppt <dig> show properties that differ from those involved in the classic mannose 6-phosphate receptor mediated sorting. prominent differences in the endocytic trafficking of ppt <dig> can be seen when compared to a well characterized lysosomal hydrolase. also the size and the modifications of neuronal ppt <dig> differ from those of ppt <dig> produced in fibroblasts. therefore, further investigations in this complex field are essential to resolve the precise disease mechanisms of incl. most importantly, clarification of the neuronal transport properties of ppt <dig> will offer a basis for developing novel therapeutic strategies.
