BACKGROUND
the hedgehog  signaling pathway has been the focus of much research in the last two decades, highlighting the importance of this morphogen in the control of patterning, differentiation and proliferation during development and disease  <cit> . the consequences of aberrantly activated hh signaling have been identified using forward and reverse genetic approaches in vertebrates and invertebrates. large-scale genetic screens using zebrafish identified mutants encoding several components of the hh signaling pathway, like shh  <cit> , smo  <cit> , gli <dig>  <cit> , gli <dig>  <cit> , dispatched  <cit> , dzip <dig>  <cit>  and scube <dig>  <cit> . mutants of the hh pathway were mainly identified morphologically by their effect on somite development, as they resulted in u-shaped somites. this defect probably results from the absence of adaxial cells or muscle pioneers in the mutant myotome  <cit> . the proteins encoded by these mutants are mainly positive regulators, where inactivating mutations result in an inhibition of the pathway. recently, we showed that a class of mutants consisting of dre, uki and lep, encode the negative regulators of hh signaling, sufu, hip, and ptc <dig>  respectively  <cit> . these mutants show an increased level of proliferation in different tissues but do not show the usual patterning defects described for hh overexpression experiments. the slight activation of hh in these mutants did not result in similar defects as seen by ectopic expression of shh  <cit>  or dnpka  <cit> , morphologically resulting in flattened somites. additionally, optic cup vs. stalk differentiation defects  <cit> , dorsoventral patterning of the brain  <cit>  and neural tube , are described to be controlled by hh signaling. none of these phenotypes could be observed in the dre, uki or lep mutant. triple mutants for sufu, hip and ptc <dig> did not show an enhanced phenotype, suggesting that additional regulators are still functioning to inhibit the hedgehog pathway, most likely ptc <dig>  <cit> .

a well-described role for hh signaling during development involves the specification of the myotome in fast and slow muscle type fibers   <cit> . this gene is a downstream target of hh signaling  <cit>  and can act as a transcriptional repressor  <cit> . ectopic prdm <dig> expression is able to rescue slow muscle development in smu mutants, completely lacking hh signaling  <cit> , indicating a pivotal role for prdm <dig> in specifying slow muscle cell identity.

besides its role in specification and differentiation of muscle cell identity, a well-established role for hh involves the regulation of a/p patterning of the outgrowing fin buds. the fin buds arise from specified regions of the lateral plate mesoderm  by a cascade of different genes. one of the earliest factors involved in fin field induction is vitamin a derived retinoic acid , produced by aldh1a <dig>  gibert et al,  <cit> , have shown that ra produced in the somitic mesoderm is necessary during early segmentation  for proper fin induction. the ra signal is thought to be transferred to the intermediate mesoderm where it activates wnt2b  <cit> . subsequently, the t-box transcription factor tbx <dig>  <cit> , one of the earliest genes known to be expressed in the fin field, is induced in the lpm under control of wnt2b  <cit> . in the fin mesenchyme, tbx <dig> induces, among other genes, fgf <dig>  fgf <dig> and prdm <dig> expression to further specify the fin primordium. fgf <dig> induces the expression of shh in the posterior mesenchyme of the fin bud  <cit>  called the zone of polarizing activity  <cit> , which organizes the a/p patterning of the outgrowing fin. the importance of hh for zebrafish fin development became apparent in the syu and smu mutant that encode shh and smoothened, respectively. these mutants do form fin buds, but subsequently fail to grow out correctly  <cit> . on the other hand, a slight activation of hh signaling, as described for the ukihu418b mutant, results in enlarged pectoral fins, probably as a result of increased proliferation within the developing fin bud  <cit> . these data show that hh is functioning rather late in the genetic program controlling pectoral fin development.

here we describe the identification of two ptc <dig> alleles, showing subtle hh overexpression phenotypes, affecting eye and somite development. in contrast, zebrafish mutants for both ptc genes show severe developmental problems, indicating redundancy between the two ptc homologues. we find that constitutive activation of hh signaling negatively regulates the induction of the pectoral fin field. the hh signaling pathway therefore acts significantly earlier in fin field induction than its well-described role in a/p patterning of the outgrowing fin bud. additionally, a negative role for hh signaling in the specification of a/p patterning of the somites is observed, where somites of the ptc1;ptc <dig> mutants appear to be apolar, without affecting segmentation. this is the first evidence that a/p patterning and segmentation are uncoupled processes. the described mutants assign novel roles to hh signaling during development and will be of major importance for further studies focusing on the effects of constitutive activation of hh signaling during development and disease.

RESULTS
identification and recovery of a splice-donor mutation in the ptc <dig> gene
the dre, uki, and lep mutant class has shown that multiple regulators secure the activity of the hh signaling pathway. this was illustrated by the fact that the concurrent loss of function of the negative regulators sufu, hip and ptc <dig> did not result in the typical hh overexpression phenotype, mainly concerning the chevron shape of the somites  <cit> . presumably, the slight increase in hh signal is enough to increase ptc <dig> expression via a sensitive auto-regulatory loop, thereby maintaining the pathway at a certain level of activity, which does not exceed the threshold for hh activation that will lead to patterning defects.

to test this hypothesis we have generated a target-selected knockout of the ptc <dig> gene. an enu-induced mutation library of approximately  <dig>  f <dig> fish was screened for mutations in this gene using the tilling method  <cit> . this resulted in the identification of a splice donor mutation, changing the 5' consensus sequence of the intron after exon  <dig>  from gt, to at . the removal of this splice site results in the insertion of the  <dig> bp intron into the transcript . rt-pcr  and sequencing experiments on a fragment containing exons  <dig> to  <dig> confirmed that this complete intron is inserted in frame into the orf, resulting in an expansion of the second extracellular loop of the ptc <dig> protein by  <dig> amino acids .

ptc1hu <dig> mutants show an eye and somite phenotype
zebrafish homozygous for ptc1hu <dig> display a subtle somite phenotype at  <dig> hours post fertilization , where the angle of the chevron shaped form of the somites becomes more obtuse . the average angle of the somite is 84° in a wild type situation , compared to 99° for the ptc1hu <dig> mutant . however, the typical flattened somite phenotype, as observed after shh overexpression in zebrafish, was not observed, probably due to redundancy with ptc <dig>  additionally, at  <dig> hpf a partially penetrant eye phenotype is observed, where the retinal pigmented epithelium  extends into the diencephalon . this phenotype has already been described for the blowout  mutant  <cit> , suggesting that blowout may also be a mutation in ptc <dig>  complementation analysis indicated that ptc1hu <dig> and blwtc294z are allelic . subsequent sequence analysis of all exons of ptc <dig> identified a premature stop codon  in the blwtc294z allele, located after the eighth transmembrane domain . comparing ptc1hu <dig> with blwtc294z revealed that ptc1hu <dig> has a higher penetrance of the eye phenotype  than blwtc294z . additionally the rpe in the ptc1hu <dig> extends more severely into the diencephalon of the embryo compared to blwtc294z , suggesting that the ptc1hu <dig> allele is stronger. as transcription of ptc <dig> is known to be upregulated by increased hh signaling, we decided to test whether our mutations resulted in an increase in ptc <dig> transcripts. in situ hybridization  experiments showed that both alleles resulted in an increase in ptc <dig> transcripts. in addition, the blwtc294z mutant  shows milder upregulation than the ptc1hu <dig> mutant  at  <dig> hpf, again indicating that the latter allele is stronger. an alternative explanation for this observation might be that the splice donor mutation in ptc1hu <dig> increases the stability of the ptc <dig> transcript, subsequently resulting in a higher expression level after ish. therefore we analyzed the expression levels of gli <dig>  another downstream transcriptional target of hh signaling  <cit>  to confirm the overactivation of the pathway in the ptc1hu <dig> mutant. the expression levels of gli <dig> at  <dig> hpf distinguishes wild types from heterozygotes and mutants . this confirms that the pathway is indeed activated, and that the increase in ptc <dig> expression is not a consequence of altered stability of the transcript, due to the induced mutation, but a representation of the activity of hh signaling in this mutant.

the ptc1hu <dig> allele results in an in frame insertion of  <dig> amino acids into the protein sequence, and therefore we investigated whether this is a full null or a partial loss of function allele. to test this hypothesis we injected a mo against ptc <dig>  <cit>  into a ptc1hu <dig> mutant background, which did not enhance the phenotype. additionally, we checked whether the ptc1hu <dig> allele has a dominant negative effect, by injecting wild type embryos with ptc1hu <dig> mrna. no phenotypes comparable with the ptc1hu <dig> mutant were observed, excluding a dominant negative effect. together the data suggest that ptc1hu <dig> is at least a strong loss of function allele. since the ptc1hu <dig> allele is stronger than blwtc294z, we used this allele for subsequent analysis and therefore we will refer to ptc1hu <dig> when ptc <dig> is mentioned.

the hh signaling pathway is constitutively activated in ptc1;ptc <dig> mutants
by the identification of a zebrafish ptc <dig> mutant we are now able to investigate whether the inhibition of the pathway is dependent on the presence of both ptc homologues. based on the current model, the absence of both ptc proteins will constitutively activate smo, normally inhibited by ptc, which in turn activates the entire downstream pathway. double mutants for leptj <dig> and ptc1hu <dig> were generated  and these were expected to show the consequences of increased hh signaling. from previous studies it has been shown that overactivation of the hh pathway, after injection of shh or dnpka  <cit> , results in a flattened somite phenotype. phenotypically, ptc1;ptc <dig> mutants clearly exhibit a flattened somite phenotype at  <dig> hpf  confirming an activation of the pathway, by losing both ptc homologues. at  <dig> hpf, the primitive eye field is present but the lens is missing , where at  <dig> hpf a complete absence of the eyes and the nose could be observed . to confirm an activation of the pathway we analyzed the expression level of nkx <dig> a  <cit>  and gli <dig>  <cit> . the expression of nkx <dig> a is only induced when hh activity is high. a clear increase in nkx <dig> a  ptc <dig> and gli <dig>  expression could be observed between the different genotypes, confirming that the activity of the hh signaling pathway is severely upregulated in ptc1;ptc <dig> mutants. administration of  <dig> mm of cyclopamine to ptc1;ptc <dig> partially rescued the phenotype and resulted in a decrease in ptc <dig> expression levels . this confirms that the phenotype seen in ptc1;ptc <dig> mutants is a result of increased hh pathway activation.

the eye phenotype of a single ptc1hu <dig> mutant, a protrusion of the pigmented epithelium towards the medial region of the brain, could be a result of a disturbed balance between optic cup versus optic stalk differentiation. this process is reported to be under control of hh signaling  <cit> . possibly, the absence of the eyes in the ptc1;ptc <dig> double mutants could be a further disturbance of cup versus stalk differentiation. to test this hypothesis, we analyzed the expression pattern of pax <dig> and pax <dig>  identifying the presumptive optic stalk and cup respectively. indeed, ptc1;ptc <dig> mutants expand pax <dig> expression and lose pax <dig> expression in the presumptive optic cup region , confirming a differentiation defect during eye development. finally, ptc1;ptc <dig> mutants show an expansion of the lateral floor plate, indicated by foxa ish, whereas shh expression in the medial floor plate was unaffected . again, this is in line with previous reports  <cit> , and confirms the overactivation of the hh pathway in the ptc1;ptc <dig> mutants. these observations justify the assumption that the hh pathway can be constitutively activated in a genetic manner, by losing activity of both ptc homologues.

ptc1;ptc <dig> mutants show mediolateral and anteroposterior patterning defects
in zebrafish, somites give rise to several muscle types. the earliest event concerns the formation of the adaxial cells, which will later go on to form the slow muscles, whereas the rest of the somite will mainly produce fast muscle. adaxial cells that are located at the apex of the somite will become muscle pioneers, cells strongly positive for engrailed   <cit> . hh signaling from the midline induces both adaxial cells and muscle pioneers. as predicted by hh injection experiments we find that both myod  and eng <dig>   <cit>  are strongly induced in ptc1;ptc <dig> mutants, indicating that these mutants mainly form slow muscle type fibers. consistent with this somites appear to be elongated in the d/v direction and more cells appear to stack in the medial somite . to gain further proof for a conversion of the myotome towards the slow muscle fate, we analyzed the expression of prdm <dig>  known to be a key regulator for slow muscle cell differentiation  <cit> . in a wild type situation, prdm <dig> is expressed in the most posterior somites and spinal cord neurons . the expression of prdm <dig> is regulated by hh signaling  <cit> , which is confirmed by the fact that the expression level increases in the ptc <dig> mutant, and to an even higher level in the ptc1;ptc <dig> mutants. this strongly suggests that the differentiation between fast and slow muscle cell differentiation in the myotome is shifted towards slow muscle type fiber formation, possibly by upregulating prdm <dig> expression. upregulation of myod correlates with upregulation of skeletal muscle alpha actin  gene expression as a marker for muscle differentiation, and downregulation of pax3/ <dig> expression  a marker for the undifferentiated dermomyotomal cells  <cit> .

additionally, we also investigated whether the anteroposterior patterning of the somites was affected. although myod is expressed in the posterior part of recently formed somites, the expansion of the adaxial domain of myod expression in ptc1;ptc <dig> mutants means that this marker cannot be used as a/p marker. therefore, we analyzed uncx <dig> , a marker whose expression is normally restricted to the posterior part of the somite, and surprisingly, we found that it was lost . in addition, expression of fgf <dig>  which demarcates the anterior somite, was also lost , the loss of markers for both the anterior and posterior halves suggests that the somites have lost their polarity. polarity defects are also corroborated by myf <dig> expression, which has a more complex expression pattern during somite maturation .

since a/p polarity of the somites is likely to be determined during- and in fact may be necessary for, proper somite formation  we analyzed the expression of deltac  , her <dig> , and cellular morphology . in wild types, the expression of these genes shows oscillation in the presomitic mesoderm and is required for proper segmentation. these markers showed a normal expression pattern in presomitic mesoderm. furthermore, epithelialization does occur, albeit less regularly. furthermore dlc expression showed that although it is normal in presomitic mesoderm and during somite formation, it is not maintained in the posterior part of older, more anterior somites .

in an attempt to identify a link between increased hh signaling and the loss of polarity markers, we analyzed a possible role for prdm <dig> in this process. prdm <dig> can act as a transcriptional repressor, whose expression is controlled by hh signaling  <cit> . morpholino knockdown of prdm <dig> did not rescue the expression of fgf <dig> or uncx <dig>  , indicating that additional negative regulators are involved in the loss of polarity markers in the ptc1;ptc <dig> mutant somites. all these data suggest that the somites of ptc1;ptc <dig> mutants become apolar after somite boundaries have been established. to our knowledge, this is the first instance in which the process of somite formation has been genetically uncoupled from a/p patterning of the formed somite.

hedgehog signaling inhibits pectoral fin formation independent from ra signaling
the hh signaling pathway is known to regulate the formation and patterning of the vertebrate limb. however, hh signaling is supposed to perform a rather late function in maintenance and outgrowth of the fin bud. unexpectedly, the ptc1;ptc <dig> fin buds are completely lost. to investigate at which level hh is acting on the induction of the fins, we investigated the expression pattern of several genes involved in fin development, like fgf <dig> and prdm <dig>  both genes were absent in the presumptive fin field . additionally, the expression level of the transcription factor tbx <dig>  one of the earliest markers for fin bud initiation was hardly detectable at  <dig> hpf, and a slight scattered expression was observed at  <dig> hpf . initiation of tbx <dig> expression, labeling presumptive heart and pectoral fin primordia appeared normal, however . hand <dig>  is another important factor in limb bud formation in zebrafish  <cit> . the expression of tbx <dig> and hand <dig> is mutually dependent since hand <dig> expression is reduced in tbx <dig> mutants and tbx <dig> expression is reduced in hand <dig> mutants  <cit> . we therefore tested whether we could see defects in hand <dig> expression. ish at  <dig> hpf, shows the expected expression pattern of hand <dig> in posterior lateral mesoderm with a subtle difference in the future fin bud region where hand <dig> is absent . published analysis of early stages of fin bud formation suggests that tbx <dig> is only mildly reduced in a hand <dig> mutant and fin buds are still formed  <cit> . the strong reduction of tbx <dig> in ptc1;ptc <dig> mutants suggests that although hand <dig> is reduced it is probably not the only causal factor. since both hand <dig> and tbx <dig> are reduced we sought to identify defects in signals that might act upstream of these two genes. one factor that has been implicated in tbx <dig> expression is wnt2b  <cit> , however no difference could be observed in wnt2b expression at  <dig> hpf . finally, fin bud induction is known to be under direct control of ra signaling, as shown by the neckless  mutant encoding aldh1a <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, mouse aldh1a <dig> -/- embryos neither express tbx <dig> nor hand <dig>  <cit> . manipulation of ra signaling in the nls mutant, has shown that it is required before  <dig> somite stage   <cit>  for development of the pectoral fin bud, as indicated by dlx <dig> expression. additionally, ra signaling has also been shown to be necessary during early segmentation, when it is produced in the anterior somites, to induce the fin field  <cit> , where it rescues tbx <dig> expression in the neckless mutant. in the ptc1;ptc <dig> mutant aldh1a <dig> expression, required for the production of ra, was not significantly altered at the 60% epiboly stage or at  <dig> somites in ptc1;ptc <dig> double mutants . in an attempt to rescue the fin phenotype, we treated double mutant embryos with ra. concentrations ranging from 10- <dig> to 10- <dig> m did not rescue the formation of the pectoral fins . however, the expected morphological defects in axis formation were obtained, showing that ra can signal in the ptc1;ptc <dig> mutants. we conclude that the hh signaling pathway represses induction of the fin bud, and acts independent of ra signaling.

hedgehog signaling is inhibiting fin induction during segmentation
since the expression of wnt2b is not affected in the ptc1;ptc <dig> mutants and exogenous ra treatment is unable to rescue the fin phenotype, we tried to determine in which time window hh is preventing fin field induction. therefore, we treated  <dig> embryos, obtained from a ptc1+/-;ptc2+/- incross, with  <dig> μm cyclopamine between 50% epiboly and different developmental stages. this concentration of cyclopamine does not severely affect wild type siblings. by using this rather low concentration we do not affect the later role for hh in outgrowing of the fin bud, but specifically focus on its supposed early role in fin bud induction. as a readout for a possible rescue, we examined tbx <dig> expression at  <dig> hpf, showing a clearly distinct finbud in the wild types  and an absence of tbx <dig> in the ptc1;ptc <dig> mutant . transient inhibition of hh by cyclopamine between 50% and 100% epiboly  did not re-establish a localized tbx <dig> expression in the presumptive fin field. however, low tbx <dig> expression could be detected, in contrast to the untreated ptc1;ptc <dig> mutant . localized expression of tbx <dig> was detected when hh was inhibited between 50% epiboly and  <dig> ss . this can be enhanced when ptc1;ptc <dig> mutants are treated with cyclopamine between 50% and the  <dig> ss . thus inhibiting hh signaling during early segmentation stages clearly rescued tbx <dig> expression in the fin field. however, it is not clear how quickly the cyclopamine is washed out. furthermore no obvious outgrowth of the pectoral fin bud was observed in these embryos at  <dig> hpf, which indicates that high levels of hh signaling can still inhibit pectoral fin outgrowth after the  <dig> ss in the ptc1;ptc <dig> mutant. to further investigate the time window in which hh is negatively regulating fin induction, we treated embryos with  <dig> μm cyclopamine from  <dig> ss,  <dig> ss,  <dig> ss and  <dig> hpf towards  <dig> hpf . restricted expression of tbx <dig> can only be rescued when hh activity is inhibited starting from the  <dig>  or  <dig> somite stage . adding cyclopamine at  <dig> ss or  <dig> hpf results in a scattered tbx <dig> expression  which is nearly similar to the untreated ptc1;ptc <dig> mutants . these experiments suggest that hh signaling is inhibiting recruitment of tbx <dig> positive cells during the segmentation period . during this time, the closest source of potential hh signaling is at the midline. the normal fin primordium is located approximately 130-150μm, this is somewhat further than the estimated active range of midline hedgehog signaling  and would suggest such signals would normally not  occur in the fin region.

discussion
isolation and characterization of a patched <dig> mutant
our previous research has shown that the hh signaling pathway is strictly controlled in zebrafish to prevent overactivation, since the concurrent loss of sufu, hip and ptc <dig> does not result in the severe morphological defects  <cit> , that have been described for hh overactivation. we previously hypothesized that a combined loss of both patched proteins should result in a constitutive activation of the hh pathway. contrary to ptc <dig>  there was no zebrafish ptc <dig> mutant available to confirm this idea. here we report the identification of a zebrafish ptc <dig> mutant via a reverse genetic approach. the identified splice donor mutation, results in the insertion of intron  <dig> consisting of  <dig> base pairs into the transcript, enlarging the second extracellular loop of the protein by  <dig> amino acids and the inserted amino acid sequence has no homology to known proteins or domains. previous reports have described that the first and fourth extracellular loops are required to bind hh  <cit> . there are two likely explanations for the observed effect. firstly, the modified protein is not inserted correctly in the membrane, and can therefore not exert its normal function. an alternative possibility is that the extended loop mimics the effect that hh binding normally has, or that it somehow affects the sterol-sensing domain. this scenario might result in a correctly localized protein, which would however, lose its repressive capacity on smoothened. although the consequence of this insertion on a protein level is hard to predict, the hh pathway is clearly constitutively activated, since ptc <dig>  nkx <dig> a and gli <dig> expression are severely increased in ptc1hu <dig> mutants.

zebrafish mutants homozygous for ptc1hu <dig>  show a somite defect, as expected from hh overexpression experiments, where the angle of the somite becomes more obtuse. however, the strength of the phenotype is surprisingly mild, since mouse data suggest that ptc <dig> is the main inhibitor of hh signaling. in mice, ptc <dig> knockouts are embryonic lethal  <cit>  and ptc <dig> mutants are viable without obvious defects  <cit> , indicating that ptc <dig> is the major regulator in mammals. this could indicate a functional shift between zebrafish and the mouse homologues of ptc. this shift may also be reflected by the fact that the comparisons between the mouse and fish genes does not result in a clear one-to-one relationship between the ptc <dig> and ptc <dig> homologs  <cit> .

ptc1;ptc <dig> double mutants show the consequences of constitutive activation of hh signaling
the ptc <dig> mutant enabled us to confirm our hypothesis that in zebrafish ptc <dig> is the key negative regulator of the hh pathway, conferring a stronger phenotype than the triple mutant made with sufu, hip and ptc <dig>  the ptc1;ptc <dig> double mutants showed the expected flat somite phenotype, which is the classical effect of hh overexpression. additionally, mutants homozygous for both the ptc1hu <dig> and ukihu418b mutations also resulted in flattened somites confirming the idea that ptc <dig> expression is induced above a certain activity, thereby preventing the pathway from further activation . this is a likely scenario since subtle increases in ptc <dig> expression could be observed in ptc <dig> and hip mutants  <cit> , confirming the idea that ptc <dig> has a pivotal role in controlling the activity of the pathway. the constitutive activation of the pathway in ptc1;ptc <dig> double mutants results in similar phenotypes as described after injection of shh or dnpka, concerning the optic stalk versus cup differentiation in the developing eye, patterning of the floor plate and differentiation of fast and slow muscle cell types, thereby validating these mutants as a model system to study the consequences of aberrantly activated hh signaling.

inhibition of the hh signaling pathway is necessary for the establishment of somite polarity
somite a/p information has previously been shown to be necessary for proper segmentation  <cit> . in the zebrafish mutants fused somites   <cit> , anterior information is lost and the complete somite is posteriorized  <cit> , resulting in the lack of somite boundary formation. when anterior and posterior polarity genes are expressed throughout the complete somite, segmentation is disturbed. this has been shown for the beamter , deadly seven  and after eight  mutants  <cit> , which do only form the first four, seven and eight somites respectively, as a consequence of mutated components of the notch signaling pathway  <cit> . the a/p axis is thought to be established in the presomitic mesoderm, and is thought to be required for morphological boundary formation  <cit> .

the ptc1;ptc <dig> mutants show that a/p patterning in the presomitic mesoderm/nascent somite can be separated from maintenance of a/p patterning in existing somites. we analyzed expression of her <dig> and dlc in the presomitic mesoderm and found no defects, indicating that the oscillations in their expression occur normally. this is confirmed by a normal morphological progression of somitogenesis in double mutants. from the known role of hh signaling in paraxial mesoderm, and myod labeling experiments, we expect that the paraxial mesoderm is completely induced to become adaxial. we conclude that adaxial cells are capable of executing the oscillations required for segmentation and are capable of forming somite boundaries. however, analysis of dlc has shown that the somites are not able to maintain the a/p pattern in the somites. surprisingly, such somites do not show a default a or p identity, rather they appear to be apolar .

since the hh signaling pathway leads to activation of transcription via the gli genes, repression of the former genes has to occur via intermediate repressors. prdm <dig> was tested as an good candidate, but morpholino-knockdown of this gene could not rescue fgf <dig> or uncx <dig>  expression, indicating that additional repressors are induced. since we have tested only a limited set of markers we cannot exclude that the somites have some currently undetectable a/p polarity.

most markers that show a/p differences are not expressed in the adaxial cells or are expressed in all adaxial cells without displaying a/p differences. thus it might be assumed that polarity is lost because adaxial cells do not participate in this patterning, and hh signaling from the midline induces adaxial fates. loss of hh signaling has not been shown to affect somite a/p patterning, thus such a interference model appears attractive. even though the effect on myf <dig> expression suggests that a/p is directly by the hh signal, our data currently cannot exclude an indirect model where premature muscle differentiation prevents expression of such markers.

somite a/p pattern has been reported to guide patterning of the motoneurons of the neural tube  <cit> . in mutants ptc1;ptc <dig> neural tube patterning itself is affected by ectopic hh signaling, thus in order to study this tissue specific knockouts are required. nevertheless, we find defects that are at least consistent with defects in a/p patterning .

hedgehog is a negative regulator of pectoral fin formation
one of the most surprising phenotypes of the ptc1;ptc <dig> double mutant is the absence of the pectoral fins. thus far, only a positive role for shh signaling in limb development has been described, and this function is supposed to be later in development after the establishment of the limb bud  <cit> . indeed, zebrafish mutants that abolish hh signaling, like syu or smu, do have fin buds, but these fail to grow out  <cit> . although shh is required late in limb formation, gli <dig>  a downstream component of the hh pathway, may act earlier. this has been shown convincingly by several reports  <cit> . the results indicate that the repressor form of gli <dig>  prevents expression of hand <dig> in the anterior limb bud, thereby prepatterning this structure. according to this model activation of hh signaling should lead to processing of gli3r to gli3act and hand <dig> should become expressed in the anterior limb bud. this leads to expansion of posterior genes and ectopic shh expression. morphologically it should lead to polydactylous limbs rather than absence of limbs, similar to what has been observed in mouse gli <dig> deficient limbs. this is in fact the opposite of what we find in ptc1;ptc <dig> double mutants. we find that hand <dig> is suppressed and that shh expression is lost in the prospective fin bud. one possible explanation for this discrepancy is that there are evolutionary differences between fish and more advanced vertebrates. therefore, it will be interesting to create a mouse ptc1;ptc <dig> double mutant to test whether the findings from zebrafish hold up in mammals. recently, a mouse ptc <dig> mutant has been generated  <cit> , but since the ptc <dig> mutant  <cit>  is embryonic lethal, more sophisticated inducible mutants should be generated to test whether our finding on fin induction are conserved in mammals.

retinoic acid may have an early role in establishing the fin bud territory, since ra has been found to affect tbx <dig> and hand <dig> expression. during segmentation, ra formed in the first few somites is necessary to induce fin induction with a critical time window between gastrulation and  <dig> hpf  <cit> . we have not found any evidence that the effect of hh acts through a ra signal. the expression of aldh1a <dig> is not altered by hh activation and exogenous ra does not rescue pectoral fin formation. furthermore, wnt2b acts downstream of ra to establish the pectoral fin territory, and its expression is also unaffected in the ptc1;ptc <dig> mutant. our results suggest that hh signaling may have a very early negative effect on the establishment of the fin field in the zebrafish.

at the  <dig> somite stage when tbx <dig> expression is just established  <cit>  and normal in double mutants, we find ptc <dig> expression both in the somites and lateral plate, whereas ptc <dig> is only detectable in the somites, however, in ptc1;ptc <dig> double mutants ptc <dig> becomes expressed more laterally as well . thus it is possible that patched proteins function around this stage in the fin primordium to maintain tbx <dig> expression. this does not exactly fit with our data that cyclopamine rescues already at the 50%-  <dig> somite stage. however, rapid development, in combination with perdurance of the cyclopamine after wash-out could account for this. it might be possible that hh signals from the midline could put a limit to the fin bud territory at the medial side. however such a model would imply that loss of hh signaling should lead to an increase in the tbx <dig> expression domain towards the midline, which has not been reported  <cit> . to accommodate for this, such a model would require a second unknown signal that inhibits expansion in parallel to hh.

an alternative explanation would be that a subset of cells in the somites is transformed into adaxial cells/slow muscle, or intermediate mesoderm could be affected. as a result of this transformation a cell type may be lost that is capable of inducing the pectoral fin primordia, or gain a signal that blocks formation of these primordia, creating a neomorphic phenotype. indeed, the lbx <dig> positive population of premigratory limb muscle cells is lost in ptc1;ptc <dig> mutants , but there is currently no evidence that these particular cells are required to form a limb bud in mice or fish  <cit>  again this model would require postulation of a second unknown signal. in the case of a positive signal, it would be required parallel to the "ra/wnt2b" signal. elegant experiments from gibert et al.  <cit> , suggest that there is no second positive signal from the somites, since application of ra in embryos in which the paraxial mesoderm is genetically ablated can induce early fin markers.

we currently favor the first model where hh signaling can inhibit tbx <dig> directly in the fin primordia but that this is normally redundant and may help to make pectoral fin development more robust. transplantation experiments may help to resolve where ptc <dig> and ptc <dig> exert their inhibitory function through the somites or directly in fin primordium, but such experiments will be challenging due to the low frequency of ptc1;ptc <dig> double mutants, and the inability to identify such animals at the stage these experiments are normally performed.

CONCLUSIONS
altogether, this report describes the identification of two zebrafish ptc <dig> mutants and two novel and unexpected roles for hh signaling during development, as observed in the ptc1;ptc <dig> mutant. using this model system, we are now able to study the consequences of constitutive activation of hh signaling during vertebrate development, in a stable genetic manner, which will be important for fully understanding the role of hh during development and disease.
