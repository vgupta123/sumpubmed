BACKGROUND
the intimate interaction between the environment and the organism can be profound; ambient environmental stimuli, such as temperature, are powerful catalysts for biomolecular movement and development that manifest as permanent biological changes. such is the case for temperature-dependent sex determination , in which the sexual fates of organisms are seemingly determined not by genotypic factors, but by environmental temperature during a specific embryonic period known as the temperature sensitive period . in vertebrates, tsd has been observed primarily in reptiles, and the bipotential gonad itself is thought to be receptive to thermal signals . however, mechanistic details of this interaction between environmental temperature and tsd transcriptional profile cascade have remained unclear. while many past reports have focused on conserved genes with known function in sexual differentiation across vertebrates, such as amh, cyp19a <dig>  and sox <dig> , very few other genes have been closely investigated, leading to a limited understanding of overall gene expression throughout tsd. critical questions, such as how the developing gonad translates temperature cues into specific biochemical signals, remain unanswered.

several hypotheses accounting for the molecular mechanism underlying tsd have been proposed. steroid hormone involvement has long been suspected to play a role in tsd, as these molecules are known to play a critical role in sex differentiation in non-mammalian vertebrates  <cit> . furthermore, glucocorticoid has been demonstrated to induce sex reversal in various vertebrate species including reptiles  <cit> , though how the syntheses of steroid hormones are regulated by temperature remain unanswered. another major mode of biological response to temperature is epigenetic modification; mounting evidence points toward an involvement of epigenetic modifications in sexual development  <cit> . past studies reported sexually dimorphic dna methylation patterns in promoter regions of major sexual development genes in a temperature specific manner, including tsd organisms . other factors often associated with temperature stress, such as heat shock proteins  and cold inducible rna binding proteins , have also been suggested to play a role in tsd  <cit> . these varying responses to thermal influences at multiple levels ultimately result in a highly receptive regulatory network that underlies multitudes of cellular processes. thus, the effect of temperature on the molecular environment can be profound and far-reaching, and consequently, there is crucial need to gain a comprehensive picture in order to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying tsd.

crocodilians are thought to be entirely composed of tsd species  <cit> , which includes the american alligator, alligator mississippiensis  <cit> . in a. mississippiensis tsd, the sexual fates of bipotential gonads are directed in a temperature-dependent manner to differentiate into either testes at a male producing temperature  at  <dig>  °c, or into ovaries at female producing temperature  at 30 °c or  <dig>  °c  <cit> . a recent report shows that sex determination in alligator embryo is thermosensitive as early as stage  <dig> , approximately 18- <dig> days after oviposition  <cit> . prior to this report, however, the tsp was defined as occurring during stages 21- <dig>  roughly between  <dig> and  <dig> days after oviposition. it is during this later period  that temperature effects are reflected in the gonadal development, and many of the key sex determination/differentiation genes acquire sexually dimorphic expression patterns . the timing of developmental stages and whole-body morphological growth is also greatly influenced by temperature during embryogenesis in the long term  <cit> . unfortunately, an effective method to perform gene manipulation is not currently feasible in alligators, and options are limited for detailed studies. this holds true with many of other reptiles and hence, much of the sex determination mechanisms studies in this evolutionary pivotal clade has been primarily resolved through comparative analyses with mammalian or avian sex determination mechanisms.

with rapidly emerging next generation sequencing technologies, global transcriptome studies such as high-throughput rna sequencing  is becoming readily available for non-model organisms  <cit> . in addition, a number of reptilian genomes have become publicly available , and comprehensive annotated crocodilian genome assemblies have been released on the national center for biotechnology information   <cit> . as one of the first tsd species with a published genome, the alligator a. mississippiensis is an ideal species for studying molecular signaling cascades and gene expression networks during sex determination in tsd species.

in this study, rna-seq analyses were performed on developing alligator embryonic gonads incubated under mpt or fpt conditions and sampled at various time points to assess transcriptome changes related to each temperature condition during gonadal differentiation. we present an initial investigation into the sexual development cascade within the alligator tsd system, and provide descriptive data on expression patterns during early sexual development, with the emphasis on the identification of novel candidate genes that might account for alligator sex determination. to our knowledge, this is the first whole transcriptome analysis performed on a tsd organism. these results should allow for insights into the early progression of testis and ovarian fate, and provide a foundation for better understanding the genetic programs driving vertebrate tsd.

RESULTS
experimental design and sequence assembly
for sample preparation for transcriptome analyses, field collected a. mississippiensis eggs were transported to the laboratory and incubated under fpt  until ferguson developmental stage  <dig>  <cit> , a period in which the gonads are still bipotential and morphologically indistinguishable. at stage  <dig>  a subset of eggs was shifted to mpt  while the remaining eggs were maintained at fpt for the subsequent incubation period . incubations at high fpt  were not performed in the current study. tissues comprising the developing gonad were carefully dissected at multiple time points after stage 19; at day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> post-stage  <dig> for analysis on sex determination cascade. the samples represent the bipotential gonad prior to incubation temperature shift , post temperature shift , and during sexual fate commitment and differentiation . although the embryos are incubated under different temperatures, the embryonic staging indicate that at least until day  <dig> the embryos at respective time points are at within same developmental stage, and confounding variables by differential temperature effects are minimized  <cit> . in addition to day 0- <dig> , gonads from day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> post-stage  <dig> were also sampled , although day  <dig> was sampled in fpt only . illumina hiseq <dig> sequencing produced a total of  <dig>  million paired-end reads  and were assessed for quality. the reads were mapped to the alligator genome assembly , using the latest ncbi annotation available at the time . the average mapping rates was  <dig>  %, among which  <dig>  % of the mapped reads were single hits, indicating an overall relatively good quality of reads.fig.  <dig> experimental design. experimental design of the rna-seq analysis is illustrated. bipotential, sex fate commitment and sex differentiation period are indicated, with temperature sensitive period . the dotted line represents the end of the tsp. eggs were first incubated under female producing temperature  until just prior to the onset of sexual differentiation , which were then either shifted to male producing temperature  or kept at fpt. gonadal regions were sampled from individuals at several subsequent time points  with corresponding approximate developmental stage  displayed in the bottom table. day 0– <dig> represents the timing of sexual differentiation, and three individuals per temperature condition per time points are used



transcriptome characterization of alligator gonadal development
differentially expressed gene  analysis was performed using cuffdiff workflow   <cit>  to screen degs with false discovery rate  adjusted p-value < <dig> . to evaluate differential expression across development for embryos incubated at the same temperature, multiple comparisons of the fold differences were conducted between temporally adjacent time points under each incubation condition . development-dependent deg analysis revealed extensive gene expression kinetics during the course of gonadal morphogenesis, and were profiled . overall, at mpt, day 0- <dig> showed  <dig> degs, of which  <dig>  displayed expression movement at multiple occasions. at fpt, day 0- <dig> showed  <dig> total degs, of which  <dig> degs  also displayed expression movement at multiple occasions. several noteworthy gene expression patterns were observed; under both mpt and fpt conditions, the transition from day  <dig> to  <dig> accounted for the majority of degs, and nearly half of the total degs  were specific to day 3- <dig>  this timing corresponds to the onset of morphological differentiation in which the enlargement of presumptive sertoli cells are observed in the medulla at mpt , and might be an indication of the activation of male and female cascade and gonadal fate commitment  <cit> .fig.  <dig> overlap of development-dependent and sex-dependent differentially expressed genes. venn diagram of differentially expressed genes  in  day  <dig> to day  <dig> mpt  conditions and  day  <dig> to day  <dig> fpt  conditions based on genome mappings of tophat. c venn diagram for number of degs between day  <dig> to day  <dig> mpt and fpt conditions at respective time points, based on genome mapping using tophat. number values in blue indicate the number of genes with mpt-biased expression, while values in red indicate the number of genes with fpt-biased expression. all degs were determined based on statistical significance  using cuffdiff software. further details are available in additional files  <dig> and 4




increases in the magnitude of sexually dimorphic gene expression profiles were then examined in detail. sex-dependent deg analysis between mpt and fpt samples were conducted at each corresponding time points in respective groups for intergroup comparisons . day 0- <dig> intersex comparisons revealed a total of  <dig> degs. mpt biased gene expression in each time point gradually increased with the progression of sexual development . however, similar to intrasexual development-dependent degs, a majority of sexually dimorphic gene expression was time point specific. ten genes were consistently sexually dimorphic at all  <dig> time points .

identification of immediate temperature-responsive genes
cross-comparisons between day  <dig> fpt embryos and day  <dig> at mpt and fpt were performed to evaluate for the mpt-specific immediate temperature-responsive gene expression . in order to assess the impact of the temperature shift between day  <dig> fpt and day  <dig> mpt on gene expression, as well as to account for the shared gene expression movement between day 0- <dig> fpt and day 0- <dig> mpt, significant male-specific differential expressions between day  <dig> fpt and day  <dig> mpt with resulting sexual dimorphism between day  <dig> embryos were identified. the analysis generated  <dig> mpt specific degs , of which  <dig> were also found to be sexually dimorphic between day  <dig> mpt and day  <dig> fpt as well . seventeen genes with significant upregulation at mpt  and  <dig> with significant downregulation  were detected, and are likely candidates for immediate temperature-responsive genes . while the current study focused upon fpt-to-mpt shift, a complementary mpt-to-fpt study would be ideal to fully identify potential upstream temperature-responsive genes in both male and female sex determination cascades.fig.  <dig> candidate temperature-responsive differential gene expression. a venn diagrams show the number of degs between day  <dig> and day  <dig> incubated either under mpt  or fpt .  <dig> genes  were found to have mpt-specific gene expression movement, possibly in response to changes in incubation temperature. b  <dig> out of  <dig> genes were found to have been up- or down-regulated significantly enough to be sexually dimorphic.  <dig> genes displayed mpt-biased expression and  <dig> genes displayed fpt-biased expression. red, blue, and grey indicate fpt-, mpt- or non-bias, respectively. c top  <dig> biological process gene ontology terms mapped to the candidate temperature-responsive genes with highest node score, based on blast2go program



oxidative stress responsive-gene uncoupling protein- <dig>  displayed the most prominent up-regulation, and suggests the presence of oxidative stress signaling in gonads incubated at mpt  <cit> . oxidative stress can be induced by number of factors including the thermosensitive cation channel trpv <dig>  which incidentally is also tightly co-localized with ucp <dig> in mammals . interestingly, trpv <dig> has also recently been observed to potentially be involved with alligator tsd  <cit>  and may partially account for the immediate temperature-responsive degs identified in the current study. interestingly, other degs identified in this study  are also co-expressed with trpv <dig> in other mammalian tissues, and may share a functional pathway . however, the relationship shared between these genes and trpv <dig> during the alligator gonadal sex determination is yet to be elucidated.

gene ontology  analysis was performed on the temperature-responsive transcripts. interestingly, ‘regulation of transcription, dna-dependent’ was one of the highest biological process terms highlighted, and several transcriptional regulators were detected . most were downregulated by the temperature shift to mpt, such as kdm6b and jarid <dig>  the roles of chromatin remodelers such as cbx <dig> and jmjc <dig> have been well documented in mammalian sex determination  <cit> , which prompt us to speculate that similar chromatin modification might occur during alligator tsd. further analysis using chromatin immunoprecipitation  techniques may help elucidate the chromatin state in alligator gonads during tsd. wnt <dig>  which is expressed in mammalian granulosa cells, was also downregulated by shifts to mpt  <cit> . transcription factor ccaat/enhancer binding protein α  was upregulated by shifting incubation temperature to mpt. c/ebpa is observed to be active in a wide array of cell differentiation cascades, including mammalian germ cell sex differentiation  <cit> . because the current study did not distinguish between cell types, gene expression specific to somatic and primordial germ cell sex development is unclear. vertebrate somatic and germ cell sex determination cascades are distinct. thus, resolving the spatial expression patterns for these genes in alligators will further aid in characterizing their roles and functions during tsd.

characterization of known sexual development genes
although vertebrate upstream sex determination mechanisms differ by species, downstream sex differentiation genes appear to be highly conserved by comparison  <cit> , and expression pattern of genes that have been well characterized in alligator sex differentiation were investigated . overall, our rna-seq data was in accordance with the previous reports, based mostly on studies utilizing rt-pcr and in situ hybridization techniques. although, a few surprising discrepancies were revealed by the precise transcript level measurements afforded by rna-seq analysis  <cit> . for example, the timing of sexual dimorphism in amh expression was earlier than previously thought, and was observed as early as day  <dig>  there was a significant upregulation of amh under both mpt and fpt conditions between day  <dig> and day 3; however, the degree of upregulation was far greater at mpt  and continued upregulation was observed at later time points, whereas up-regulation in fpt diminished . expression of ad4bp/sf <dig>  a nuclear receptor involved in gonadogenesis and steroidgenic cell differentiation, was reportedly dynamic in alligator during and after sex determination, though depending on the literature, contradicting expression patterns were also reported  <cit> . here, our results indicate that ad4bp/sf <dig> is initially fairly stable at both temperatures and only later shows an increase in expression, but does not show significant sexual dimorphism at any time point examined. expression patterns of foxl <dig>  fgf <dig>  lhx <dig>  wnt <dig>  and rspo <dig> were also characterized, last of which was not sexually dimorphic at any time point during day 0- <dig>  species differences in the expression pattern of rspo <dig> during ovarian differentiation have been noted in the past  <cit> , and similar to the pattern observed during trachemys scripta gonad sex differentiation  <cit> , there may be a brief female-biased expression between day  <dig> and  <dig> in the alligator.

characterization of candidate sexual development genes
next, we investigated expression patterns that might provide insight into those genes with central roles in alligator sex determination. cross-comparative analyses of development-dependent degs and sex-dependent degs were performed. differentially expressed genes between sequential time points that also showed sexually dimorphic expression were considered to be potentially critical for gonadal sex determination. this criterion was employed to screen out significant gene expression movement in each mpt and fpt cascades that resulted in sexual dimorphism. with this criterion,  <dig> female and  <dig> male upregulated gene candidates  for sexual development were identified , including sox <dig>  amh, and foxl <dig>  genes screened for day  <dig> mpt were overall identical to the genes categorized as immediate temperature-responsive genes, with  <dig> additional genes identified . the number of candidate genes increased greatly between day  <dig> and day  <dig> at mpt, corresponding with the expression of genes involved in testis determination, while only a few candidate genes were identified between day  <dig> and day  <dig> at fpt.fig.  <dig> candidate potential critical genes central for sex determination. a cross comparison between development- and sex-dependent degs  was performed among day  <dig> to day  <dig>  and a total of  <dig> genes were identified as candidate genes for a. mississippiensis sex determination. green and orange arrows indicate up- and down-regulation, respectively, with number of corresponding genes indicated. the majority of gene expression dynamics associated with development was observed to be mpt-specific. further information is available in additional file  <dig>  b hierarchical clustering analysis of sexual dimorphism  in the candidate genes at day  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  red color indicates high z-score  while blue indicates a low z-score 



at mpt, candidate genes identified between day  <dig> and day  <dig> contained many of the genes with known roles in vertebrate male sexual development, and were profiled for the first time in alligators. these include upregulation of dmrt <dig>  tex <dig>  in addition to previously reported sox <dig>  piwil <dig> and tdk, which are essential for mammalian spermatogenesis  <cit> , were also observed to be up-regulated at mpt during this time. these observations provide details into the transcriptional pathway underlying male fate commitment in alligator, and also reveal genes with potentially crucial roles in somatic and germ cell sex determination/differentiation.

in both the mpt and fpt cascade, several deg involved with steroid biosynthesis and metabolism were identified, including hsd17b <dig>  star, and hsd3b <dig>  also, some genes expression patterns appeared to have reversed sexually dimorphism between alligator and model organisms. for example, hemgn, a gene critical for male chicken testis development  <cit> , was up-regulated at fpt. arx, a gene involved in mammalian testis development  <cit>  was downregulated on day  <dig> at mpt and remained so at later time points. the implications of these gene expression patterns in alligator sex determination are yet to be determined. finally,  <dig> uncharacterized transcripts were found to be differentially expressed at various time points. interestingly, six of these transcripts were identified as ncrnas , though their functions and roles during alligator sexual development are yet to be defined. the presence of these ncrnas may have significant consequences on alligator sex determination as ncrna  regulation of dmrt <dig> plays a pivotal role in gallus gallus sex determination  <cit> . these observations during the early stages of alligator sexual development highlight both conserved elements and divergences from sex determining mechanisms found in other vertebrates.

inference of regulatory network
gene ontology analyses of the candidate genes for sexual development recognized  <dig> genes with putative transcriptional regulatory functions, among which  <dig> were transcription factors . the gene expression patterns were further characterized as long-term, short-term, or ambiguous depending on the duration of continuous sexual dimorphism during day 0- <dig> and day 18- <dig>  network modeling of genes from both male and female cascades were performed using the netgenerator tool  <cit>   . the predicted expression patterns based on the modeling overall fit the interpolated expression pattern , and more than half of the total modeled interactions satisfied the robustness test. the regulatory network model at mpt consisted of  <dig> edges,  <dig> robust putative gene-to-gene interactions, and  <dig> robust putative influences from mpt . at fpt,  <dig> putative edges were constructed with  <dig> robust putative influences of fpt and  <dig> robust gene-to-gene interactions . as expected, the temperature influences on the regulatory genes were predicted to be widespread in both conditions. in the mpt cascade, sox <dig>  and arx were predicted to be responsible for regulating a number of genes while in the fpt cascade, foxl <dig> was predicted to regulate the phosphatase, eya <dig>  and fabp <dig>  currently, these inferred networks are based on gene expression correlation and generic gene interactions. in vitro techniques such as reporter assays will be useful to evaluate such interactions and provide greater insight into the functional relationships between genes in this putative network.table  <dig> candidate critical genes with putative regulatory functions

CONCLUSIONS
here, we present the first rna-seq analysis of gonadal sex determination in a tsd organism. our analysis clearly shows the dynamic influence of incubation temperature on gene expression, providing insights regarding the state of the gonad at mpt. differential expression of ucp <dig>  wnt <dig>  and kdm6b highlight the presence of oxidative stress, regulation of wnt signaling pathway, and chromatin modification on testis development. furthermore, the global view of gene expression patterns in the gonad during sex determination identified candidate genes that may be integral for the alligator sex determination cascade. use of network modeling allowed further prediction of the underlying tsd genetic pathway and provides a conceptual framework for empirical tests probing the function of these pathways. these findings, along with the gene expression profiles, will aid future researches on tsd species, and in turn contribute toward further understanding of the vertebrate sex determination mechanisms.
