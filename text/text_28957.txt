BACKGROUND
skeletogenesis begins with condensation of mesenchymal chondroprogenitor cells to form the cartilage anlagen that pattern the early skeleton. subsequently, for bones that grow by endochondral ossification, the chondrocytes differentiate further to establish the growth plates. at the joint surfaces, development of articular cartilage facilitates and maintains joint movement during fetal life. these multi-step processes require the coordinated expression of many genes, including genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins and morphogens, as well as proliferative, angiogenic, and apoptotic signals  <cit> . most of our knowledge of the function of the genes involved has been derived from developmental studies in model systems and cell lines  <cit>  as well as from the identification of disease genes in skeletal disorders.

whole genome analysis of chondrocyte gene expression has the potential to reveal novel genes and gene expression programs which define the tissue. although the complete set of genes expressed in human cartilage has not yet been described, analysis of human cartilage cdna libraries has provided an initial in vivo picture of the cartilage transcriptome  <cit> . these investigations have also identified expression of both known and novel genes. comparative microarray studies in rat cartilage  <cit>  and several chondrocyte cell lines  <cit>  have provided a larger set of genes of potential importance in chondrocytes, including genes specific to the stages of chondrocyte differentiation. wang et al.  identified  <dig> genes with two-fold variation in expression between hypertrophic and proliferative growth plate chondrocytes. in this in vivo study, significant gene expression changes were principally associated with cell cycle, transcription, extracellular matrix structure, receptor and transporter functions. in microarray studies of mouse micromass cultures  <cit> ,  <dig> genes exhibited at least a ten-fold difference in gene expression as the cultures differentiated. thus global characterization of gene expression is beginning to describe the identities of key regulatory molecules and their targets in chondrocytes.

disrupting genes involved in the organization and maturation of the growth plate and/or the stability of articular cartilage results in inherited skeletal disorders that range from perinatal lethal phenotypes to mild disorders with early-onset osteoarthropathy as their major feature  <cit> . of the approximately  <dig> clinically distinguishable skeletal dysplasias  <cit> , mutations in  <dig> genes have been associated with about  <dig> disorders. many of these disease genes are expressed in a cartilage-selective pattern, and therefore identifying additional genes uniquely expressed in cartilage should yield new skeletal dysplasia candidate genes.

to identify a larger set of genes uniquely expressed in chondrocytes, this study describes a genome-scale gene expression profile for 18– <dig> week human fetal cartilage. there were  <dig> genes which appeared to be selectively expressed in fetal cartilage, comprising a variety of novel genes that may contribute to skeletal development. the data suggest a complex pattern of cartilage gene expression and indicate that the number of genes selectively expressed in cartilage has been greatly underestimated.

RESULTS
identification of cartilage-selective genes
to define a set of genes preferentially or uniquely expressed in normal human fetal cartilage, cartilage probeset intensities were compared with probeset intensities across a variety of normal tissues. a two-step process was employed for gene identification, consisting of a training step and a validation step . the tissue-selectivity of a representative sampling of the identified genes was confirmed by quantitative rt-pcr.

the training dataset consisted of five independent cartilage samples and  <dig> non-cartilage samples, all analyzed using affymetrix u <dig>  <dig>  plus arrays. the average correlation coefficient among the cartilage samples  was  <dig> . to identify unbiased relationships within the data, and to test the robustness of the normalization and tissue-specificity, an unsupervised approach  <cit> , in which the genes and tissues were grouped based only on expression patterns, was employed. probesets with the greatest variation across all tissues and whose expression in any two arrays differed by at least two standard deviations from their mean expression across the entire set of samples were selected. this selection yielded  <dig> probesets.

two-way hierarchical clustering based on similarity of expression of these  <dig> probesets within the samples was performed . samples from the same tissues clustered together, indicating that the normalization was sufficiently robust to allow tissue-selective expression patterns to be identified. even with these relatively non-stringent selection criteria, the results showed a surprisingly large number of genes with a fetal cartilage-selective expression pattern. at least  <dig> probesets representing  <dig> genes with coordinately higher expression in cartilage relative to non-cartilage tissues appeared to drive the clustering of the two groups . these probesets formed a gene expression node in the dendrogram which shared an overall expression correlation of  <dig> . the genes represented by these probesets included some well established cartilage-selective genes, including aggrecan , type × collagen , and matrilin  <dig> , among others. thus, a comparative approach with microarrays can identify genes whose expression is cartilage-selective.

to define a ranked list of genes significantly expressed in cartilage, a supervised analysis  <cit> , comparing cartilage versus non-cartilage gene expression, was employed. this consisted of a two-class analysis with a modified t-test  . there were  <dig> probesets representing  <dig> genes with at least three-fold differential expression when comparing cartilage and non-cartilage tissues, with a false discovery rate of zero. of these,  <dig> of the  <dig> probesets demonstrated higher expression in cartilage with respect to non-cartilage tissues, while the remaining  <dig> probesets were expressed at significantly higher levels in the other tissues. as observed for the hierarchical clustering, probesets representing well-known cartilage markers, including col2a <dig>  agc <dig>  comp, col9a <dig>  and mmp <dig> were among the top genes listed. in addition, lubricin , an articular cartilage-specific marker, was also identified, confirming the ability to identify genes specific to fetal articular cartilage. indeed, among the top  <dig> probesets more highly expressed in cartilage, only four probesets, representing unannotated genes, were derived from genes not previously known to be expressed in cartilage.

in silico validation
three array platforms were used to validate the  <dig> probesets identified in the supervised analysis and generate a robust list of cartilage-selective genes . a majority of these probesets ) were identified in  <dig> u133a and  <dig> u133b arrays using the celsius database , and represented expression from  <dig> normal tissues. a small proportion of the probesets  are not found on the affymetrix™ human genome u133a/b arrays, so these probesets were identified in the analysis of  <dig> u <dig> plus  <dig>  arrays, representing eight non-cartilage tissues. a summary of the validation and the tissue distribution are available as additional files.

genes were ranked by selectivity  and classified into four functional classes structural protein , enzyme , signaling , and extracellular matrix enzyme . genes associated with skeletal phenotypes in mice and/or human or genes are denoted in mouse and human columns, respectively. sam defines the rank order of each gene identified by two-class sam analysis of cartilage versus non-cartilage tissues. the average cartilage expression divided by the median of non-cartilage expression  is listed for each gene.

of the three platforms, the u133a dataset was the most robust with regard to the number of arrays, biological replicates, diversity of tissues, probes identified, and gene annotation. from this platform,  <dig> of the  <dig> probesets identified in the sam analysis as expressed at a higher level in cartilage were obtained. two hundred seventy-four of the  <dig> probesets , representing  <dig> genes, exhibited at least five-fold higher expression when compared to non-cartilage tissues and were ranked by cartilage-specificity using an analog of coefficient of variation  . of these,  <dig> probesets, representing  <dig> genes, were identified with a cv < 50% in non-cartilage samples, constituting the cartilage-selective gene set from this platform . twenty of these genes have mutations that have been associated with skeletal phenotypes in humans and/or mice, representing 44% of the probes selected from this platform.

eight hundred eighty-two of the  <dig> probesets were identified from the u133b validation set. two hundred fourteen of these probesets, representing  <dig> genes, were well measured in cartilage with at least five-fold higher expression in cartilage relative to non-cartilage tissues. of these,  <dig> probesets had a cv less than 50% in non-cartilage samples, representing  <dig> cartilage-selective genes , including  <dig> genes also identified using the u133a platform .

a subset of the cartilage-selective genes was represented only on the human genome u <dig> plus  <dig>  arrays and were selected from the analysis of  <dig> non-cartilage samples. in total 201/ <dig> probesets were not represented in the u133a/b array set. of these  <dig> probesets,  <dig> probesets, representing  <dig> genes, had a five-fold higher expression in cartilage than non-cartilage samples. by including the cv selection criterion,  <dig> probesets, representing  <dig> cartilage-selective genes were identified and added to the complete tally , including  <dig> genes also identified using the u133a and u133b arrays .

in summary,  <dig> genes demonstrating enriched or specific expression in cartilage were selected from the comparison of cartilage and non-cartilage tissues with data derived from the u133a , u133b  and u <dig> plus  <dig>   platforms. of these, a non-redundant set of  <dig> genes , including  <dig> uncharacterized genes and  <dig> genes represented by unannotated probesets, were classified as cartilage-selective. these data greatly expand the number of genes known to be selectively expressed in cartilage and emphasize the unique pattern of gene expression that determines its properties.

qrt-pcr validation
quantitative rt-pcr was used to independently assess the tissue-selectivity of the genes identified in the microarray analysis. for each of the three microarray platforms, the probesets with a cv less than 50% were divided into 10% intervals  , and one gene from the middle of each interval was selected for analysis by qrt-pcr.

all of the thirteen of genes analyzed demonstrated higher expression in cartilage than in the seven non-cartilage tissues studied . also, with one exception , the selection threshold of at least five-fold higher expression in cartilage tissues as compared with the average expression among all non-cartilage tissues imposed for the microarray analysis, was observed. for most of the genes studied by qrt-pcr, there was little expression in the seven non-cartilage tissues , indicating that including the coefficient of variation in the ranking algorithm preferentially identifies genes selectively expressed in cartilage. also, there was an inverse correlation between the gene rank and the standard deviation in expression level among non-cartilage tissues, indicating that genes with a higher rank were more selectively expressed in cartilage. finally, there was a trend of decreasing cartilage selectivity moving from the u133a to u133b to u <dig>  <dig>  qrt-pcr validations, likely reflecting the decreasing robustness of comparison datasets in the respective platforms. overall the qrt-pcr experiments replicated and validated findings derived from the comparative microarray data.

representative genes are listed from each validation platform in order of 10% cv interval.  number of non-cartilage tissues in which amplification was not detected. average ct values for each gene were calculated for both cartilage  and non-cartilage  tissues. where no amplification was observed the maximum ct value  was used for calculations. fold difference  is calculated from the difference in cartilage and non-cartilage ct values.

discussion
using genome-scale microarrays, gene expression in human fetal cartilage was compared with a robust set of other normal tissues. hierarchical clustering showed remarkable similarity among the 18– <dig> week fetal cartilage expression profiles and demonstrated that a subset of the cartilage transcriptome is composed of a unique gene set not generally expressed in the other tissues studied. using sam,  <dig> probesets measured preferential expression of  <dig> genes with at least three-fold higher expression in cartilage as compared with other tissues.  <dig>  of these probesets matched genes identified in a cartilage growth plate cdna library  <cit>  validating their expression in cartilage via an independent dataset. the identification of genes known to have restricted patterns of expression in cartilage confirmed the presence of rna derived from the reserve , hypertrophic , and terminally differentiated  chondrocytes, in addition to genes expressed throughout all zones of the growth plate. this analysis suggested that there is differential transcriptional regulation of many genes in fetal cartilage and that the data could be used to identify genes selectively expressed in the tissue.

tissue-selective genes have been previously defined as genes with enriched expression in a particular tissue  <cit>  and characterized with algorithms dependent on the degree of differential expression relative to other tissues, including t-test  <cit> , sam  <cit> , fold change  <cit> , and enrichment scores  <cit> . while these approaches successfully identify tissue-selective genes, the reliance on fold change reduces the significance of many selectively expressed genes with low fold change. to compensate for this and identify cartilage-selective genes expressed at lower levels, the approach presented here placed increased significance on the preferentially expressed genes that showed the least variation of expression in non-cartilage tissues. this was made possible by the use of publicly-released reference gene expression data performed on the same platform and led to the reliable identification of genes with lower fold changes, but high cartilage selectivity. the impact of the use of coefficient of variation on the ranked gene list is apparent in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  in the u133a dataset, nine of the top  <dig> genes were ranked higher than  <dig> in significance in the sam ranking. the average fold change of the probes for these nine genes was  <dig> , while the average fold change of the probes for the other  <dig> of the top  <dig> genes was  <dig> . one of these probes, col10a <dig> was among the top four cartilage-selective genes using the cv algorithm but ranked at  <dig> by sam . in the u133b dataset, which contains a higher percentage of unannotated genes,  <dig> of the top  <dig> probes had a sam ranking below  <dig>  and the average sam ranking was  <dig>  overall, to identify only the most cartilage-selective genes, a threshold of 50% coefficient of variation was used across all three platforms, yielding  <dig> cartilage-selective genes. a subset of  <dig> of the  <dig> cartilage-selective genes was studied by quantitative rt-pcr in cartilage and eight non-cartilage tissues to independently assess tissue selectivity. the data confirmed the cartilage-selectivity of genes with less than 50% cv, validating the selection procedure and suggesting that the gene expression patterns determined by microarray analysis are representative.

the coefficient of variation selection approach could, in theory, equally select for three different patterns of expression: cartilage-specific genes; genes with a consistent level of baseline expression in non-cartilage tissues; and genes with significant but equal expression in all tissues . in this data analysis, however, the most highly ranked genes consistently demonstrated little or no expression in non-cartilage tissues. the data thus demonstrate that incorporating coefficient of variation preferentially selected for genes not significantly expressed in non-cartilage tissues, yielding genes likely to have important and perhaps unique roles in cartilage.

regardless of expression level, a cartilage-selective expression pattern suggests that the product of each identified gene may have a functional role in the development of the skeleton. concordant with this hypothesis, mutations in  <dig> of the  <dig> selected genes have been associated with skeletal phenotypes in humans and/or mice. included among them were the products of the well characterized genes encoding aggrecan and the cartilage-specific collagens, gene products known to have a prominent role in skeletal development and endochondral ossification. by this measure, the remaining genes may be candidate genes for skeletal dysplasias in which the disease gene has yet to be identified. as new skeletal dysplasia loci are defined, coincidence between a locus and a cartilage-selective gene may promote rapid identification of the disease gene. knockout of the orthologous genes in mice would also facilitate exploring the role of each gene in skeletal development.

classification of the biological roles of the products of the cartilage-selective gene set reveals genes with diverse functions including structural proteins of the cartilage extracellular matrix, enzymes that modify them, and  <dig> gene products with unannotated function. there were  <dig> genes that are components of signaling pathways, and only 43% of these were identified by sequence analysis of a comparable fetal cartilage cdna library  <cit> . among the genes were elements of the nitric oxide, vegf, tnf/rank, and gp <dig> pathways, all of which have known roles in the growth plate  <cit> . mutations in the genes encoding some of the molecules in these pathways, including rps6ska <dig>  lifr, tnfrsf11a and ikbkg, have been associated with human skeletal dysplasias  <cit> , again suggesting that the remaining genes may also serve critical roles in endochondral ossification.

multiple genes encoding members of the lif/gp <dig> signaling pathway met the definition of cartilage-selective genes. lif is a cytokine that is expressed in terminally-differentiated growth plate chondrocytes  <cit>  and signals through the gp130/lifr complex. homozygosity for loss of function mutations in the lif receptor produces the recessively inherited skeletal dysplasia, stuve-wiedemann syndrome  <cit> . in addition to their skeletal features, these patients have cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, neurologic and metabolic abnormalities, likely attributable to the role that lifr plays in embryonic or fetal development. genes on the cartilage-selective gene list upstream of the receptor include rela and relb, nf-kb survival transcription factors that increase transcription of lif  <cit> , as well as the lif gene itself. through the lifr/gp <dig> complex, lif can regulate both the jak/stat and erk map kinase pathways. pathway components downstream of the receptor include atf <dig>  part of the atf1/creb transcription factor complex that participates in erk map kinase signaling  <cit> . the atf1/creb complex is also regulated by phosphorylation by the product of the rps6ska <dig> gene  <cit> , another gene in the mapk/erk pathway that is associated with a skeletal phenotype. the gene encoding rps, a phosphorylation target of rps6ska <dig>  <cit> , was also cartilage-selective, but the role of this protein in growth plate differentiation has yet to be determined. finally, the gene encoding fosl <dig>  a fos-like transcription factor activated by the erk/mapk pathway which binds cjun to form a transcription complex  <cit> , was among the cartilage-selective genes identified. thus comparative microarray analysis has identified multiple components of a regulatory pathway that can be explored to further evaluate their importance in growth plate differentiation and endochondral ossification.

while this study has provided a deep set of genes that exhibit a cartilage-selective expression pattern, there are some limitations to the analysis. first, the study focused on total cartilage rna, including all types of growth plate chondrocytes, as well as articular cartilage. as a result, it cannot be determined if the selected genes are expressed in all types of chondrocytes or only a subset of cells. in this context, nine of the cartilage selective genes have been shown to be more highly expressed in hypertrophic cells relative to proliferating chondrocytes in the rat and/or mouse  <cit> . second, the cartilage samples were derived from a single anatomic site and a narrow window of fetal development, so it is unclear to what extent the observed gene expression pattern can be generalized. third, neither all possible non-cartilage tissues nor each type of cell within each tissue were studied, so cartilage-selectivity could be affected if additional fetal and/or adult tissues that express the identified genes were found. this may be particularly important for other connective tissues such as bone, tendon and ligament which contain cells known to express some of the cartilage-selective genes identified here.

not all genes selectively expressed in developing cartilage will necessarily be identified using this approach. for instance, the col2a <dig> gene fell just below the rigorous 50% cv standard set to define cartilage-selectivity. the underlying reasons for this are complex. probe performance as well as the known expression of col2a <dig> in fetal liver and heart, are likely to have had an effect, as both factors could have contributed to the variation in expression in non-cartilage tissues. in addition, the approach presented here treated the three expression platforms, u133a, u133b and u <dig>  <dig>  equally from the viewpoint of the threshold for cartilage-selectivity. because the comparative dataset of normal tissues was both broader and deeper for the 133a platform, additional genes from this platform, albeit with greater than 50% cv, could be considered to be tissue-selective . thus, a platform independent threshold would likely yield additional genes of interest within the u133a dataset. finally, tissue-specific genes were identified using only microarrays and a single generalized algorithm. additional genes selectively expressed in cartilage could be identified by less stringent criteria or other methods.

CONCLUSIONS
genome-scale comparative expression analysis using human fetal cartilage and a broad set of normal human tissues has identified  <dig> cartilage-selective genes, including  <dig> uncharacterized genes. the data identify novel gene products that may provide essential roles in normal skeletogenesis and suggest new candidates for the over  <dig> inherited skeletal disorders in which the disease gene has not been identified. the results demonstrate that fetal cartilage is a complex and transcriptionally active tissue, and that the set of genes selectively expressed in cartilage has been greatly underestimated.
