BACKGROUND
pluripotency is the differentiation ability of a cell to give rise all embryonic and adult cell types. studies of embryonic stem  cells have revealed molecular mechanisms that govern pluripotency involving in both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms  <cit> . three transcription factors oct3/ <dig>  sox <dig> and nanog are regarded as pivotal regulators because the loss-of-function experiments confirmed their essential functions for maintenance of pluripotency in es cells as well as in peri-implantation development  <cit> . moreover, the gain-of-function experiments emphasize their function associated to pluripotency. nanog overexpression supports self-renewal of mouse es cells in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor  and promote imposition of pluripotency on somatic cells after cell-fusion with es cells  <cit> , whereas ectopic expression of oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig> with additional two transcription factors klf <dig> and cmyc is sufficient to induce pluripotency in embryonic and adult fibroblast cells  <cit> . oct3/ <dig> co-operates with sox <dig> to activate transcription of the target genes including oct3/ <dig>  <cit> , sox <dig>  <cit>  and nanog  <cit> . it has been recently shown that sox <dig> is essential to maintain expression of oct3/ <dig> in es cells  <cit> , suggesting that these three transcription factors form a network to maintain pluripotency.

in addition to oct3/ <dig>  sox <dig> and nanog, other putative transcription factors expressing pluripotent stem cells in stem-cell-specific manner have been identified. rex <dig>  was first identified a gene that expresses in f <dig> embryonal carcinoma  cells and is down-regulated after retinoic acid  treatment to induce differentiation  <cit> . this gene encodes a c2h <dig> zinc-finger protein that is closely similar to yy <dig>  an evolutionally-conserved component of polycomb-related complex  <dig>  <cit> . its highly-specific expression in pluripotent stem cells has been confirmed in mouse and human es cells  <cit> , making it one of the most famous markers of pluripotency tested in various stem cells such as multipotent adult progenitor cells  <cit>  and amniotic fluid cells  <cit> . however, its function in es cells has not yet been characterized well although it has been reported that a targeted deletion of rex <dig> results in loss of the ability to differentiate into visceral endoderm induced by ra in f <dig> ec cells  <cit> , and that a gene silencing by rna interference for rex <dig> results in loss of capacity to self-renew in es cells  <cit> .

in this paper, we report our results of functional assay of rex <dig> in es cells as well as in embryos. over-expression of rex <dig> in es cells neither induces differentiation in the presence of lif nor maintains self-renewal in the absence of lif. rex1-/- es cells can be established and contribute whole embryos after blastocyst injection, indicating that they possess proper pluripotency. rex1-/- mice were produced by the intercross of heterozygotes, and both male and female homozygotes were normal and fertile. our data proofed that rex <dig> is dispensable for maintenance of pluripotency beyond the shadow of a doubt.

RESULTS
generation of gain- and loss-of-function mutant es cell lines for rex1
to analyze the precise function of rex <dig> in the maintenance of pluripotency, we generated a series of genetically-engineered es cell lines for its gain- and loss-of function analyses. for loss-of-function analysis, we disrupted the endogenous rex <dig> allele by conventional gene targeting via homologous recombination in es cells . the knock-out  allele should be a functionally null allele because the first  <dig> bp of the open reading frame in the exon  <dig> including the start codon was replaced by the pacegfp chimeric gene cassette containing the puromycin-resistant gene  and the green fluorescent protein  cdna. interestingly, all of the puromycin-resistant clones obtained by transfection of this ko vector carried the correctly targeted alleles. one of the rex1+/- es cell line  was cultured with high-dose puromycin to obtain the rex1-/- es cell lines generated via spontaneous gene conversion. as the result, multiple rex1-/- es cell lines were established with extremely high efficiency . correct targeting events were confirmed by the loss of the polymorphic signature of the wild-type allele on the southern blot analysis of the genomic dna , in which the  <dig>  kb fragment corresponds to the rex <dig> pseudogene on chromosome  <dig> reported previously as well as found in the mouse genome data  <cit> . northern blot revealed the loss of the transcript derived from the wild-type allele in rex1-/- es cells, which express the large transcripts composed by the truncated rex <dig> and pacegfp . rex1-/- es cells were also established by introduction of the second knockout vector carrying the hygromycin-resistant gene as a selection marker into rex1+/- es cells with pacegfp followed by the selection with hygromycin b. genotyping of  <dig> drug-resistant clones revealed that  <dig> clones were rex1+/- and  <dig> clones were rex1-/-, indicating that rex1-/- es cells were able to be established without selection pressure . easy isolation of the rex1-/- es cells suggested that the rex <dig> function is not essential for self-renewal of es cells.

for gain-of-function assay for rex <dig>  the rex <dig> cdna isolated from es cell rna by rt-pcr was inserted into the expression vector pcag-iz  <cit>  and introduced into the wild-type and the rex1-/-es cells. since the strong activity of the cag expression unit  <cit> , the bi-cistronic design of the expression vector with internal ribosome entry site   <cit>  and the character of the zeocin selection system, in which high level expression of the zeocin-resistant gene  is required for the host cells to survive in the medium containing  <dig> Î¼g/ml of zeocin  <cit> , all of the resulting transfectants express rex <dig> cdna at comparative or higher level to that of the endogenous rex <dig> gene in the wild-type es cells. since the efficiency to obtain the zeocin-resistant clones was not different between wild-type and rex1-/-es cells, the over-expression might not affect self-renewal of es cells .

as the results of these gene manipulations, we established es cell lines with four different genotypes for rex1; es cells carrying the wild-type rex <dig> alleles and the empty cag-iz vector , the wild-type rex <dig> alleles and the rex <dig> transgene , the rex1-/- alleles and the empty vector , and the rex1-/- alleles and the rex <dig> transgene . since the rex1-tg express rex <dig> at twice levels of the endogenous rex <dig>  the wt-tg es cell lines express rex <dig> at three times more than the wild-type es cells as the sum of endogenous and exogenous transcripts, whereas the ko-tg lines express at the twice levels of the wt es cells . both tg es cells express rex <dig> at the half level of the wt es cells from the constitutively-active transgene irrespective to the culture condition, whereas the endogenous rex <dig> gene is down-regulated immediately after induction of differentiation by either withdrawal of leukemia inhibitory factor  or formation of embryoid bodies  .

minor effects of rex <dig> on the pluripotency-associated transcriptome
first we tested rex1-dependent transcription in es cells since the rex <dig> protein may function as a transcription factor like its most homologous protein yy <dig>  indeed, we confirmed that the chimeric rex <dig> proteins with egfp-tag and ha-tag localize in nuclei . one of the important functions of yy <dig> is mediated by the interaction with the polycomb related complexes   <cit> , and it was reported that yy <dig> directly interact to prcs and recruit them to the targets in sequence-specific manner  <cit> . recently, the functional importance of prcs in es cells to repress differentiation-related genes has been disclosed  <cit> . gene expression profiles were qualitatively examined by the microarray analyses of two rex1-/- es cells , and one wild-type es cells , revealing that very few genes showed significant differences in their expression levels between wild-type and rex1-/- es cells . a pair-wise comparison of rex1+/+ es cells  and rex1-/- es cells   <  <dig> , gene expression difference > 2-fold) showed only  <dig> genes whose expression levels were significantly different. among them,  <dig> genes were up-regulated in rex1-/- es cells , whereas  <dig> genes were down-regulated . to verify the relationship between the expressions of these genes and the rex <dig> genotypes, we quantified the expression levels in each three wt, wt+tg, ko and ko+tg es cell lines by quantitative rt-pcr . as a result,  <dig> genes  were identified as putative rex <dig> target genes since their expressions were down-regulated in ko es cells, which were restored in ko-tg es cells . these data suggested that rex <dig> may functions as a transcription factor although its impact on the maintenance of the pluripotency-assocoated transcriptome is very faint.

rex <dig> does not involve in the maintenance of pluripotency in es cells
using three independent clones each of the es cell lines with  <dig> genotypes shown above , we tested the function of rex <dig> in both dominant and recessive manners in the maintenance of pluripotency in es cells. all es cell lines propagated at the comparable growth rate and kept normal morphology . gene expression analysis by qpcr revealed no remarkable change among them for several pluripotency-associated markers such as oct3/ <dig> and nanog . all these es cells completely undergo morphological differentiation for  <dig> days after withdrawal of lif  with accompanying the up-regulation of a set of primitive endoderm markers such as gata <dig>  <cit> , gata <dig>  <cit>  and disabled homolog  <dig>   <cit>  . there was no difference in the kinetics of differentiation event although the slight increase of nanog expression was evident in wt-tg es cells . therefore, rex <dig> is incapable to maintain lif-independent self-renewal either in dominant manner like the case of nanog  <cit>  or the recessive manner like the case of mbd <dig>  <cit> .

next we tested the function of rex <dig> in es cells in relation to prcs. it was reported that targeted deletion of the prc <dig> component eed resulted in reduced ability of differentiation  <cit> , and that of suz <dig> caused delayed down-regulation of the pluripotency-assocoated markers during formation of embryoid bodies   <cit> . to test the analogous function of rex <dig>  we generated ebs from wt, wt-tg, ko and ko-tg es cells and analyzed the expression pattern of the various marker genes. the growth and morphology of ebs were indistinguishable among these es cells , indicating that the differentiation ability of ko es cells was obviously unaffected and persistent expression of rex <dig> from the constitutively-active tg does not affect differentiation event in this context. moreover, induction of the primitive endoderm markers gata <dig>  gata <dig> and dab <dig> occurred normally in these ebs irrespective to their rex <dig> genotypes , and the down-regulation of the pluripotency-assocoated markers oct3/ <dig> and nanog was also unaffected . these data as well as the gene expression profile suggested that rex <dig> function does not involve in global prc recruitment in es cells.

aberrant induction of some visceral endoderm markers in the absence of rex1
according to the previous analysis of rex1-/- f <dig> ec cells, rex <dig> might involve in differentiation of visceral endoderm  <cit> . in the case of es cells, visceral endoderm is efficiently imaged on the surface of ebs  <cit> . therefore, we generated ebs from wt, wt-tg, ko and ko-tg es cells and analyzed the induction of extraembryonic endoderm marker genes. the growth and morphology of ebs were indistinguishable among these es cells . however, the induction of two visceral endoderm marker genes, transthyretin   <cit>  and indian hedgehog   <cit> , were reduced in ebs derived from ko es cells, which were restored in ko-tg es-derived ebs, indicating that this phenotype is depend on the expression of rex <dig> . interestingly, the induction level of the sry-related transcription factor sox <dig>  which also expresses in visceral endoderm in vivo  <cit> , was also reduced in ko es-derived ebs and restored in ko-tg es-derived ebs, suggesting its involvement in visceral endoderm differentiation. however, the visceral endoderm differentiation might not completely perturbed in the absence of rex <dig> because alphafetoprotein , which is an archetypal marker for visceral endoderm  <cit> , was normally induced in ebs derived from ko es cells . in contrast, the parietal endoderm markers sparc   <cit>  and plat   <cit> , were equally induced in ebs irrespective to their genotypes for rex <dig> . these data indicated that rex <dig> function might specifically involve in the differentiation of visceral endoderm.

rex <dig> function in vivo
to fully evaluate the differentiation ability of the rex1-/- es cells, we labeled these cells by introduction of the constitutively-active egfp transgene  and injected them into blastocysts followed by transplantation in uteri of pseudo-pregnant mice to generate chimeric embryos. as a result, we obtained the embryos with widespread contribution of the fluorescent cells derived from the rex1-/- es cells, indicating that these es cells were pluripotent .

in the chimeric embryos, all extra-embryonic tissues were derived from the host blastocysts, so the deficiency of visceral endoderm formation of the rex1-/- cells in development should be uncovered. to test this point, we generated the mice carrying the null allele for rex <dig> by the mating of the male chimeras generated from the heterozygote es cells with the wild-type female mice. the resulting heterozygotes were obviously normal and healthy, and their intercross resulted in generation of the homozygotes for the rex1-null allele. although the ratios of the heterozygotes and homozygotes were smaller than the expected mendelian ratios in the offsprings at  <dig> weeks , both homozygous males and females were fertile and showed no morphological abnormalities. indeed, the homozygous offsprings were obtained by the intercross of the homozygotes, indicating that the rex <dig> gene show neither the maternal effect nor the critical role in the development of the extraembryonic tissues including visceral endoderm. when we analyzed genotypes of embryos at  <dig>  dpc, no significant reduction of heterozygotes and homozygotes was observed , suggesting that the loss of embryos with these genotypes occurred peri- or post-natal period. although the reason of this phenomenon is still unclear, these data indicated that the rex <dig> function is dispensable for the maintenance of pluripotency in the early developmental period as well as the germ cell development in the mid and late developmental periods.

discussion
cell-type-specific gene expression is one of the important landmarks of gene function in development. in es cells, microarray analysis, sage and in silico subtraction of est database have been identified several genes specifically expressing in undifferentiated es cells. among them, rex <dig> is one of the oldest marker genes of undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells first reported on  <dig>  <cit> . since then, the function of rex <dig> has been kept as a mystery, but here we finally revealed its dispensability to maintain cellular pluripotency.

rex <dig> was first identified as the gene which expression is repressed by ra in f <dig> ec cells. a deletion of rex <dig> from f <dig> cells resulted in the loss of ability to differentiate into visceral endoderm induced by ra and cyclic amp analogs without no phenotypical change in their undifferentiated state  <cit> , which is consistent with our result shown here. in contrast, it was recently reported that rnai-mediated silencing of rex <dig> in es cells prevents self-renewal  <cit> . the controversy between the phenotypes of gene-targeting and gene-silencing might be derived from the different kinetics of silencing or the strong bias of the selection of homozygous mutant es cells that allow establishment of adopted es cells for the absence of the particular gene function. although both might be the case for rex <dig>  neither es cells nor mouse embryos show any phenotype in the maintenance of pluripotency, suggesting that the imperfect target specificity of gene-silencing by rnai might be most responsible to give the discrepancy in this case since the expression vector to generate large double-strand rna was applied in the above report.

why does the function of rex <dig> revealed here look so minor although the previous reports suggested its importance in es cells as the common target of the pluripotency-associated transcription factors oct3/ <dig>  sox <dig> and nanog  <cit>  as well as the component of the protein-interaction network  <cit> ? one simple explanation is functional redundancy between rex <dig> and its related gene present in the genome. rex <dig> encodes the c2h2-type zinc-finger whose sequence is most similar to the transcription factor yy <dig>  <cit> . yy <dig> widely expresses in various tissues in embryos and adults and its function is essential for peri-implantation development  <cit> . since rex <dig> express in inner cell mass of the blastocyst-stage embryos and its expression is down-regulated after implantation  <cit> , the pre-implantation development of yy1-null embryos might be supported by the overlapped function of rex <dig> and its down-regulation after implantation might cause their lethality. the function of yy <dig> is pleiotropic  <cit>  and one of them is the function to recruit prcs to the specific target sequences to repress the transcription of the target genes  <cit> . although the several reports showed the function of the polycomb complex for the maintenance of pluripotency in es cells  <cit> , the function of yy <dig> in pluripotent stem cells has yet been confirmed. since yy <dig> expresses in es cells, it may mask the phenotype of the rex1-/- es cells by the functional redundancy. it was recently reported that rex <dig> is a pseudogene generated from yy <dig> by retrotransposition  <cit> . the zinc-finger domain of yy <dig> is encoded by  <dig> exons whereas that of rex <dig> is encoded in a single exon, and yy <dig> is evolutionally conserved in all vertebrates, whereas rex <dig> is found only in placental mammals. this hypothesis suggests that yy <dig> occupies the major role in the redundant function to rex <dig> and vice versa. the specific function of rex <dig> to induce particular markers in visceral endoderm might be conducted by its different preference of the target sequence from yy <dig>  <cit>  or down-regulation of yy <dig> in this cell type.

the most prominent phenotype of the rex <dig> deficiency is the poor induction of a subset of visceral endoderm marker genes. in the case of f <dig> ec cells, the null mutation for rex <dig> completely prevent differentiation of visceral endoderm induced by ra and camp analogs, which was evaluated by the complete loss of induction of one of the visceral endoderm markers, afp. in contrast, in es cells, the suspension culture allows induction of visceral endoderm without any small molecule inducers, and the loss of rex <dig> affects the induction of ttr and ihh, but not afp. how can the rex <dig> deficiency modulate the expression of the visceral endoderm marker genes although its expression is tightly restricted in pluripotent stem cells and down-regulated during their differentiation ? one possible explanation is that the gene expressing in the pluripotent stem cells under the control of rex <dig> might induce the gene in the visceral endoderm adjacent to them in ebs like the case of fibroblast growth factor- <dig> , which is produced by the pluripotent stem cells and acts as a paracrine growth factor for the extra-embryonic endoderm cells and the trophectoderm cells  <cit> . however, the functional significance of the reduced levels of these visceral endoderm markers associated to the rex <dig> deficiency should be very minor because the rex1-null embryos are absolutely capable to develop normally in early embryogenesis.

it is a surprise that this is the first report of the rex <dig> knockout mice because this gene was discovered  <dig> years ago, has been regarded as an important marker of pluripotent stem cells, and the generation of the heterozygous es cell line via gene-trap was reported in  <dig>  <cit> . the cell-type-specific expressions of genes have been regarded as good landmarks of their functions. indeed, oct3/ <dig> and nanog show highly specific expression in pluripotent stem cells in vitro as well as in vivo and exhibit essential function to maintain pluripotency. however, there are several exceptions of this relationship in the genes specifically express in pluripotent stem cells. in the cases of fbxo <dig>  sox <dig> and dppa5/esg <dig>  the null mutant embryos for them show no abnormality and the null es cells are capable to be established and maintained although their expression is as tightly restricted in pluripotent stem cells as the case of oct3/ <dig>  <cit> . the discrepancy between the specific expression and the function in pluripotent stem cells might due to the global down-regulation of gene expression during differentiation of pluripotent stem cells via epigenetic mechanism. it was discovered that the epigenetic repression of gene expression is quite loose in the pluripotent stem cells, which is established during their differentiation  <cit> . in addition, the cell-cycle regulation is also dramatically altered during differentiation since the s-phase is enriched in es cells whereas the g <dig> phase is predominant in differentiated cells  <cit> . therefore, no specific transcriptional regulation might be required for genes to exhibit the stem-cell-specific expression pattern especially if their expressions depend on the cell-cycle. indeed, in the case of rex <dig>  the octamer motif for the binding of oct3/ <dig> identified in the mouse rex <dig> promoter  <cit>  is not conserved in the human rex <dig> promoter based on the ensembl database search, although the previous reports confirmed that both are capable to direct stem-cell-specific transgene expression  <cit> , suggesting that the oct3/4-independent regulation might be critical for its stem-cell-specific expression.

this is not the end of the story of rex <dig>  however. the intercross of the rex <dig> heterozygotes revealed mild reduction of the homozygous pups between  <dig>  dpc and  <dig> weeks after the birth. although the reason of this lethality with low penetrance is completely mysterious since the expression of rex <dig> is only detectable in the germ cells at the late-stage embryos and the pups, rex <dig> should have some function apart from the pluripotent stem cells, which is out of our scope of the research. we hope the rex <dig> mutant mice strain we generated will be applied for the further studies to unlock the mystery of the rex <dig> function in the differentiated cell lineage.

CONCLUSIONS
we showed that rex <dig> function is dispensable for self-renewal of mouse es cells. although its possible function in pluripotent cells in particular developmental context has not been ruled out completely, its function is not required to maintain pluripotency in its conventional meaning.
