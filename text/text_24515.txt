BACKGROUND
with two cattle genome assemblies available  <cit> , the cattle research community has been focusing on single nucleotide polymorphisms  as the main source of genetic variation in cattle. this effort led to the development of the cattle snp map  <cit>  and the illumina bovine snp <dig>  genotyping array  <cit> . evaluations of genetic merit based on snps became a reality in early  <dig> leading to an acceleration of improvements to dairy and beef breed stocks  <cit> . widespread use of the bovinesnp <dig> array has resulted in the availability of tens of thousands of snp genotyping results. based on snp genotyping assays, qtl distributions and artificial selection signatures in dairy cattle have been reported  <cit> .

copy number variation  represents another important source of genetic variation that provides genomic structural information complementary to snp data. genomic structural variations ranging from  <dig> kb to  <dig> mb comprise mainly of cnvs in the form of large-scale insertions and deletions, as well as inversions and translocations  <cit> . in humans, ~ <dig>  cnvs that correspond to over  <dig>  cnv regions have been identified, and over  <dig>  genes have been mapped within or near regions of human structural variation  <cit> . some of these cnvs have been shown to be important in both normal phenotypic variability and disease susceptibility. several recent publications have reviewed the effects of cnvs on gene expression and human diseases  <cit> . due to their low cost and high-density, snp arrays have been routinely used for human cnv detection and analysis  <cit> . compared to cgh arrays which only report relative signal intensities, snp arrays collect normalized total intensities  and allelic intensity ratios  which represent overall copy numbers and allelic contrasts  <cit> . multiple algorithms have been developed to exploit snp data to identify cnvs, including quantisnp  <cit> , penncnv  <cit> , birdseye  <cit>  and cokgen  <cit> . comparisons of the strengths and weaknesses of these algorithms have been published  <cit> . as one of the leading methods, penncnv incorporates multiple sources of information, including total signal intensity and allelic intensity ratio at each snp marker, the distance between neighboring snps, and the allele frequency of snps. penncnv also integrates a computational approach by fitting regression models with gc content to overcome "genomic waves"  <cit> . furthermore, penncnv is capable of considering pedigree information  to improve call rates and accuracy of breakpoint prediction as well as to infer chromosome-specific snp genotypes in cnvs  <cit> .

previous cattle studies have produced a number of cnv datasets. for example, our earlier array cgh survey using  <dig> holstein bulls identified  <dig> germline cnvs  <cit> . recently, we reported a broader, systematic cnv survey in  <dig> cattle using array cgh  <cit> . we identified over  <dig> candidate cnv regions ; some of which are likely to underlie cattle domestication and breed formation. fadista et al. recently reported  <dig> cnv regions in  <dig> animals of  <dig> cattle breeds using high-density array cgh  <cit> . besides array cgh experiments, other evidences for cattle cnv came from snp genotyping results, where a screen of bovine hapmap consortium samples  identified  <dig> candidate deletions using an earlier version of cnvpartition  <cit> . however, these results only included homozygous deletions which were validated by multiple observations. a recent paper reported  <dig> unique cnv regions from  <dig> korean hanwoo cattle based on bovinesnp <dig> genotyping data; however, during the penncnv calling, the "genomic waves" pattern was not discussed and pedigree information was not considered  <cit> . in this study, we reprocessed the published bovine hapmap consortium snp genotyping results using optimal settings for penncnv by adjusting for "genomic waves" and utilizing trio/pedigree information whenever possible. we identified  <dig> candidate cnv regions in a diverse panel of  <dig> animals from  <dig> different breeds. we also included  <dig> animals from  <dig> outgroups to derive the ancestral states of cnvs. we then compared this cnv call set with the existing cattle cnv call sets, validated several novel cnvr calls and discussed the evolutionary impact of cattle cnvs.

RESULTS
optimization of cattle cnv detection
a total of  <dig>  markers were selected for the bovinesnp <dig> assay  <cit> . except for  <dig>  markers which failed to pass manufacturer assay production pipeline, we intentionally kept all remaining  <dig>  markers without any other filtering. these included  <dig>  markers  which had a call rate of  <dig>  the markers with a call rate of  <dig> are resistant to the default biallelic snp clustering and often fall in cnv regions. compared to the standard bovinesnp <dig> genotyping beadchip v <dig> featuring  <dig>  snp probes,  <dig>  more snps were included in our analysis, of which, ~17% located in cattle segmental duplication  regions  <cit> , ~9% overlapped with the cnvrs detected by array cgh method  <cit> , and ~27% contributed to the cnvrs reported here.

we tested the cattle cnv calls made with or without the -gcmodel option on batu_ <dig>  to identify the impact of genomic waves on cnv calling. agreeing with previous results  <cit> , we found the total cnvr counts were higher without -gcmodel  than those with -gcmodel enabled . however, only  <dig> %  of the gcmodel calls directly overlapped with  <dig> %  calls made without gcmodel, revealing a ~20% cnv discordancy rate. these discordant calls were likely due to false positives called from the differentiating signal intensities caused by "genomic waves" rather than by real cnv events. this further demonstrated that genomic waves have a significant effect on this type of analysis.

we also compared results of penncnv using -test, -trio and -joint options sequentially. in other words, we compared data resultant from not considering trio information , considering trio information only after calling  and finally by considering trio information in a simultaneous fashion during cnv calling  . consistent with the earlier comparisons using simulated and real snp data  <cit> , trio information significantly increased our cnv call rates. the result of the -joint option  was significantly higher than those of the other options: -test  and -trio . after merging overlapping cnvs, ~87% of the  <dig> cnvrs deduced from the -joint option overlapped with those deduced from the -test and -trio options . due to its improved call sensitivity and breakpoint inference, the -joint option reported about 13% more cnvrs which were not detected by the -test or -trio options.

cattle cnv discovery and distribution
due to issues regarding cnvr calls, we excluded chrx and chrun from our analysis. in our initial analysis of chrx, it was found that almost half of the potential cnvrs were unreasonably large  and several events were present in high frequencies . this is likely due to the fact that penncnv assumes two copies of each snp as the normal copy number state, which was likely not the case within the pseudoautosomal region  <cit>  and segmental duplications  <cit>  on chrx. additionally, since chrx sequence and annotation also differ dramatically between btau_ <dig>  and umd <dig> builds, we considered the cnv calls on chrx as unreliable and excluded them from further analysis. since chrun only contains unassigned sequence contigs, it was not included due to the lack of sequence and snps as well as the snp mapping uncertainty.

within the placed autosomes, a total of  <dig>  cnvs in  <dig> samples were detected and an average of  <dig>  gain or loss events were evident in each sample . cnvrs were determined by aggregating overlapping cnvs identified across all samples, following previously published protocols  <cit> . a total of  <dig> high-confidence autosomal cnvrs were identified, covering  <dig>  mb of polymorphic sequence and corresponding to  <dig> % of the autosomal genome sequence  and  <dig> % of the whole cattle genome .

the numbers in parentheses are normalized by sample counts except that the lengths in parentheses are average lengths normalized by cnv counts. aat sample level, each sample has  <dig>   cnvrs averagely and  <dig>   for taurine, since there are  <dig> taurine individuals without identified cnvs; b these numbers are nonredundent cnvr counts. c  <dig> cnvrs are unique to one sample while  <dig> cnvrs are shared by at least  <dig> individuals or breeds and  <dig> of  <dig> multiple events have frequency >5%; d besides  <dig> loss and  <dig> gain cnvrs, there are  <dig> cnvrs containing both loss and gain events; e outgroup animals are not included in the total counts for cnv and cnvr.

to test the stability of cnv calls with respect to different genome builds and snp mapping, we also migrated  <dig>  out of  <dig>  snp markers from btau_ <dig>  to umd <dig> using the ucsc liftover tool  <cit> , and repeated the entire calling analyses to ensure consistency in calls . only  <dig> more cnvrs were identified on the umd <dig> assembly . a simple comparison indicated that the total coverage of variable regions were  <dig> % larger on umd <dig>  than on btau_ <dig> . for all three cnvr types , counts increased slightly. this was expected as both assemblies were based on the same raw wgs reads. the most obvious difference between the two assemblies is that btau_ <dig>  unplaced contigs are placed on umd <dig>  this resulted in more markers that were on btau_ <dig>  chrun contigs to be placed on umd <dig> autosomes, which could partially explain the increase in the cnvr counts. since the majority of cattle genome annotations were performed on the btau_ <dig>  assembly, we focused on further characterization of the  <dig> high-confidence cnv regions from btau_ <dig>  autosomes.

these  <dig> cnvrs include  <dig> loss,  <dig> gain and  <dig> both  events, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> , <dig> bp with a mean or median of  <dig>  or  <dig>  bp, respectively . loss events are approximately  <dig> -fold more common than gain events, but have slightly smaller sizes than gain regions on average. furthermore,  <dig> cnvrs were found in only one sample ,  <dig> cnvrs were present in two or more animals or breeds and  <dig> of  <dig> multiple events had a frequency >5% . these datasets confirm that segregating cnvs exist among these  <dig> cattle breeds and/or groups, which is consistent with our earlier results based on array cgh  <cit> . in general, the number of cnvs identified in each sample is consistent with snp estimates of breed-specific founding and effective population sizes and levels of polymorphism based on ≥ <dig>  snps  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  more cnv events were detected in indicine  than in african groups  and composite . the taurine breeds  had the fewest detected cnvs. while some of these differences could be related to the fact that the snp markers were designed based on the btau_ <dig>  reference genome , this observation is consistent with the concept of subspecies divergence and supports the hypothesis of multiple independent domestications of cattle in the fertile crescent, southwest asia and likely africa  <cit> .

cattle cnvs are distributed in a nonrandom fashion at two different levels. first, cnv content varies significantly among different chromosomes. the proportion of any given known chromosome susceptible to cnv regions varies from  <dig> - <dig> % . chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> show the greatest enrichment for cnv  with almost two-fold of the variable content of the autosomal average. it is interesting to note that these chromosomes do not have the highest sd content  <cit> . furthermore, similar to the human, mouse, rat and dog genomes, there are a greater proportion of cnvs near pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions. excluding chrx and chrun, pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions each represent  <dig> % of genomic sequence but show an enrichment of  <dig> - <dig> -fold more cnvrs  and contain  <dig> - <dig> % of all polymorphic sequence.

quality assessment of selected cnv regions
the quality of our  <dig> cnv calls was assessed in multiple ways, though our first assessment was a comparison against existing cattle cnv datasets . one of the earlier datasets included  <dig> filtered deletion variants  reported earlier using the illumina genotyping software module cnvpartition v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . nineteen of our cnvrs overlapped with  <dig> of the deletion variants  in that dataset . we also identified  <dig> cnvrs  in our dataset that overlapped with  <dig> cnvrs from a snp-based cnv study on  <dig> korean hanwoo cattle  <cit>  . the hanwoo cnv study identified  <dig> cnvrs in total, so our dataset overlapped with  <dig> % of their calls  <cit> . we then compared our calls against an array cgh-based study of  <dig> cattle from four breeds  <cit> . since our dataset excluded cnv calls in the chrx, chrun and mitochondrial sequences, we compared our autosomal cnvr calls  to the autosomal cnv calls of that study   <cit> . only  <dig> of our cnvrs  directly overlapped with  <dig> of their calls . our final comparison was against our previous array cgh-based study of  <dig> animals from  <dig> breeds which resulted in  <dig> autosomal cnvr calls  <cit> . in this comparison,  <dig> of our snp-based cnvr calls  overlapped with  <dig> cnvrs derived from array cgh . if we only focused on the  <dig> hapmap samples which were assessed by both platforms , there were  <dig> overlapping cnvrs:  <dig> for array cgh , and  <dig> for snp array . when we merged existing cnv datasets, a total of ~  <dig> out of  <dig>  newly identified cnvrs overlapped with them .

a this includes  <dig> independent snps and  <dig> cnvrs. the statistics are calculated for  <dig> cnvr excluding the  <dig> snps; b this is the number excluding chrx and chrun; c this is the number excluding chrx, chrun and mitochondrial sequence.

it is expected that the variants identified in these studies do not overlap, suggesting a vast amount of cnvs exist in cattle population and saturation for this type of variation has not yet been approached. it is likely that many thousands of more common structural variants may still remain undiscovered in the cattle genome. a similar situation was encountered in human cnv studies using the early version of snp, cgh arrays and detection methods  <cit> . for example, although cnvpartition detects cnvs by processing the similar raw data as penncnv , it is based on a different proprietary sliding window algorithm. only those homozygous deletion events segregating in different animals were reported due to concerns with the quality of calls  <cit> . in the future, high-density snp arrays combined with improved cnv calling algorithms could remedy these differences.

besides the technology and detection method differences, the following could also contribute to the observed differences:  sampling differences:  <dig> individuals from  <dig> diverse breeds and/or groups were included in our study;  genome coverage biases:  <dig>  markers were included in our study rather than a subset of "well-behaved" snps  which exclude those snps in cnv-rich regions;  correction of genomic waves in order to minimize false positive calls; and  trio/pedigree information was fully explored in our study to improve the accuracy and call rate of cnvs. when filtering criteria varying the cnvr length and frequency were applied, we observed significant overlap within our  <dig> datasets derived from snp arrays and array cgh . for example, when the large cnvrs  were considered, the overlap reached  <dig> %. when the cnvr frequency was increased to  <dig>   <dig>  or 5% , the overlap increased to  <dig> %. when we filtered the cnvr frequency to greater than 10% of our population , the overlap included 100% of our filtered dataset. this further demonstrated that large, common cnvrs can be reliably detected through using different detection technologies even when the majority of samples were different. for example, our current snp array study identified most of the large, common cnvrs which were confirmed in our published results  <cit> .

after comparison with other existing datasets, we found that ~70% of our cnvr calls were not reported in the literature. in order to confirm these novel cnvrs, we performed  <dig> quantitative pcr  assays for  <dig> low frequency, novel cnvr calls spread among seven individuals . nine of the cnv regions had two target amplicons placed near two different snp loci. out of  <dig> total locations,  <dig> loci  were in agreement with cnv estimates by penncnv . when counting the cnv regions,  <dig> out of  <dig>  cnv regions had positive qpcr confirmations in at least one location. if cnvrs previously validated in the literature  <cit>  were also included, approximately two third  of our detected cnvrs had positive confirmations.

as expected, the bovine snp <dig> platform has a large resolution limit under the current penncnv calling criteria. the size of the cnvrs detected ranged from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  mb, with a median size of  <dig>  kb . this is partially due to the fact that the bovine snp <dig> assay was originally developed for high-throughput snp genotyping in association studies. although cnv detection is feasible with snp arrays, it is impaired by low density and non-uniform distribution of snps, especially in cnv and sd regions. compared to a cgh array, a snp array lacks non-polymorphic probes designed specifically for cnv identification. thus, only the large cnvrs are expected to be identified with the bovine snp <dig> assay. this explains the difference in cnv length between our study and the earlier results.

the discrepancies between the qpcr and penncnv results may represent small cnv events that were missed in the penncnv calls, or instances where snps caused the qpcr reaction to fail or be suboptimal but did not affect the snp assay. despite the fact that a two-copy state was assumed for test pcr loci in dominette, smaller cnv events in dominette may have evaded detection by penncnv. if our test primers amplified a small cnv event in dominette, that would skew the relative copy number estimates of our qpcr reactions. although qpcr primers were designed within  <dig> bp around the target snp positions, additional snps and small indels may have influenced the hybridization of the qpcr primers in some animals, thereby reducing primer efficiency. other causes may also contribute to the discrepancy in cnvr validation by qpcr. the draft status of the cattle genome assembly and the low snp density of the bovine snp assay make it difficult to determine the real breakpoints of cnvrs. for example, multiple, neighboring, discrete cnv events could result in a larger call by penncnv; therefore, giving an over estimation of the cnv size. therefore, it cannot be ruled out that the qpcr primers used to confirm the cnvrs may have been designed outside the breakpoints.

cnvs overlap with segmental duplications and other genomic features
following previous studies of other genomes, we detected the association between cnvrs and sds. agreeing with previous predictions regarding cattle sds  <cit> , a local tandem distribution pattern is predominant in our cattle cnvr dataset . it should be noted that about  <dig> %  of cnv regions directly overlap with cattle sds with an overlapping span of  <dig> , <dig> bp . approximately  <dig> %  of the sds  identified by wgac and wssd  <cit>  exhibit cnvs. in comparison,  <dig> % of the cnvrs  detected by using array cgh  <cit>  excluding x chromosome overlap with cattle sds, corresponding to  <dig> , <dig> bp . the proportion of our new cnvr calls  that overlap with sds reaches approximately 40% compared to 61% in our previous study. this lower overlap fraction probably reflects the fact that the bovinesnp <dig> array used in this study is biased against cattle sd regions. snp density on the array drops by one-third  in sd regions. we also failed to detect any correlation between  <dig> cnv regions and evolutionary breakpoint regions . compared to the genomic averages, cattle-specific ebrs and artiodactyl-specific ebrs do not show enrichments of cnv sequences  <cit> . this negative result is consent with the fact that ebrs have fewer overlaps with sd regions.

gene content of cattle cnv regions
within autosomes, the  <dig> cnv regions overlap with  <dig>  ensembl peptides, corresponding to  <dig>  unique ensembl genes . about  <dig> %  of high-confidence cnvrs completely or partially span cattle ensembl genes. we assigned panther accessions to a total of  <dig>  overlapping genes. statistically significant over or under representations were observed for multiple categories . this set of copy number variable genes possess a wide spectrum of molecular functions, and provides a rich resource for testing hypotheses on the genetic basis of phenotypic variation within and among breeds.

consistent with similar cnv analyses in other mammals , several of these cnvs, which are important in drug detoxification, defense/innate and adaptive immunity and receptor and signal recognition, are also present in cattle. these gene families include olfactory receptors, atp-binding cassette  transporters, cytochrome p <dig>  β-defensins, interleukins, the bovine mhc  and multiple solute carrier family proteins which support the shared go terms among mammals as shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  for gene families that went through cattle-specific gene duplication  <cit> , such as interferon tau, pregnancy-associated glycoproteins, scp <dig> and ulbp and wc <dig>  subfamilies, we also detected marked variation in copy number between individuals and across diverse cattle breeds and/or groups . it is intriguing to note that we also detected variations of tlr <dig>  and ppara . this current cnv survey further supports a hypothesis that the generation of new cnv insertions and deletions may be a constant phenomenon in multiple cattle breeds/individuals  <cit> .

we also overlapped our cnvrs with two sets of genomic regions under positive or balance selection detected by ihs and fst using snp data  <cit>  . by doing so, we have identified cnv regions that may span potential cattle qtls and human orthologous omim genes influencing disease susceptibility . for instance, multiple cnv regions directly overlap with qtls for significant and typical economic traits and  <dig> out of  <dig> cnvrs correspond to loci known to cause disease in humans. however, since the cattle genome and cattle qtls are less well defined, future study is warranted.

cattle cnv frequency differences among breeds
to highlight the potential evolutionary contributions of these cnvs to cattle breed formation and adaptation, we queried  <dig> cnvrs that have breed-specific cnv frequency differences . we only considered breeds that had at least  <dig> samples and any detectable variations must be identified in at least  <dig> individuals or 10% of samples . fifty-eight of these cnvrs correspond to annotated genes or gene families; many of which were identified in other mammals as influencing adaptation to the environment. some of the annotated genes are known to be important in cattle adaptation including cnvr <dig> in brown swiss, cnvr <dig>  in hereford  <cit>  and cnvr <dig>  in most of breeds . the differences of cnv frequency among cattle breeds supported our earlier hypothesis that some cattle cnvs are likely to arise independently in breeds, are likely to contribute to breed differences and are therefore related to the breed formation and adaptation. however, the observed differences between breed variations could be caused by both selection and genetic drift due to genetic bottlenecks for some breeds. our findings, therefore, must be confirmed with an even larger sample size.

cnvs in outgroup animals
for the  <dig> individuals in outgroups, which were analyzed similarly together with  <dig> modern breeds individuals,  <dig> cnvs and  <dig> cnvrs were detected, covering  <dig>  mb base pairs, with  <dig> gain and significantly more  loss events . about  <dig> % of our current cnvrs  directly overlapped with  <dig> % of these ancient cnvrs  derived from ancient outgroups, which indicates over one third of cnvrs were likely ancestral. we suspected this observation of more loss events than gain events was at least partially related to the high genetic divergences between these outgroup animals and the cattle reference genome. with additional cattle, sheep, goat and pig cnv papers published recently  <cit> , it will be interesting to look into the evolutionary mechanism of cnvs within livestock animals.

CONCLUSIONS
we have performed a comprehensive genomic analysis of cattle cnvs based on whole genome snp genotyping data, therefore providing a valuable genomic variation resource. a total of  <dig> cnvrs were identified, covering  <dig>  megabases  of the genome. a subset of these cnvrs showed mendelian inheritance and were also confirmed in other cattle cnv studies and other mammalian species. as high density cattle snp genotyping data are becoming available, cnvs combined with snps, may help identify genes undergoing artificial selection in domesticated animals.
