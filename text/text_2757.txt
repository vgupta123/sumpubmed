BACKGROUND
arabinogalactan proteins  are an abundant class of proteoglycans in plant cell walls and are implicated in the control of cell proliferation and morphogenesis  <cit> . numerous studies using monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated the developmentally regulated appearance of specific glycan epitopes correlated with changes in anatomy . hence subtle differences in the glycan structure of agps may function as markers used in coordinating developmental processes in plants. however, defined structural features of the active agp glycans have not been identified and their molecular specificity is unknown.

the glycans of agps originate by post-translational modification of protein backbones catalyzed by glycosyltransferases  in the secretory pathway. the glycan structure of agps is heterogeneous, but commonly composed of a β- <dig> -linked galactan backbone with substitution of the side chains at o <dig> positions . the side chains are typically β- <dig> -galactans, usually modified with arabinose  and less frequently with other sugars such as rhamnose , fucose , and  glucuronic acid   <cit> . it is anticipated that more than  <dig> functionally distinct gts are required to build the agp glycans, and so far fucosyltransferases   <cit> , galactosyltransferases , and a glucuronosyltransferase   <cit>  have been characterized.

we have characterized an arabidopsis gt encoded by at1g <dig>  which is co-expressed with atgalt31a <cit>  and atglcat14a <cit> . this protein belongs to gt <dig> family in the carbohydrate active enzyme database   <cit> . the gt <dig> family contains large numbers of eukaryotic and viral sialyltransferases acting on glycoproteins and/or glycolipids  <cit> . several plant sequences have been placed in this family, and two of the rice sequences expressed in cos- <dig> cells showed sialyltransferase activity  <cit> . arabidopsis has three proteins in this family . two of them  expressed in cos- <dig> cells and in nicotiana benthamiana, respectively, lacked sialyltransferase activity  <cit> .

in this paper, we provide evidence for  β- <dig> -galactosyltransferase  activity, encoded by at1g <dig> in the biosynthesis of type ii ag structure,  its interaction with atgalt31a, and  an increase of β- <dig> -galt activity by the protein complex in an in vitro assay.

RESULTS
at1g <dig> is co-expressed with other type ii arabinogalactan glycosyltransferases
the protein encoded by at1g <dig> is predicted to have a single transmembrane domain at val5-ile <dig>  a typical type ii membrane topology commonly found in gts. the transcript levels are generally low in arabidopsis throughout development, but higher during seed maturation and root development, and the gene is co-expressed with atgalt31a <cit>  and atglcat14a <cit> , which were recently identified as possessing galactosyltransferase and glucuronosyltransferase activity, respectively, involved in the glycosylation of type ii ags   <cit>  . therefore, we presumed that the activity encoded by at1g <dig> may be involved in the glycosylation pathway of type ii ags, and investigated this hypothesis by biochemical assays using the protein expressed heterologously.

recombinant protein encoded by at1g <dig> showed galactosyltransferase activity towards type ii arabinogalactan acceptors
for biochemical characterization, the full-length at1g <dig> construct harboring n-terminal ha tag was expressed in n. benthamiana and affinity purified using monoclonal anti-ha-antibody conjugated to agarose. the ha-at1g <dig> collected on the bead slurry was used as the enzyme source for identification of donor substrate. we identified the donor substrate by testing  <dig> different ndp--sugars according to the methods  <cit> . we used microsomes prepared from n. benthamiana after expression of a synthetic peptide composed of a consensus sequence for ag glycosylation as acceptor for the assay . this acceptor represents a mixture of various type ii ag polysaccharides . when substrate mixtures were tested, we observed higher level of -sugar incorporation from a mixture of udp--glcnac, udp--glca and udp--gal  than from one containing udp--xyl, udp--glc, gdp--man and gdp--fuc . when testing each substrate in the mix ii separately, we found udp--gal works as a substrate . the result indicates that the enzyme possesses a galt activity, therefore, we named the enzyme atgalt29a .

atgalt29a is localized to golgi apparatus and interacts with atgalt31a
we determined the subcellular localization of atgalt29a by transient expression of the c-terminal monomeric cfp  fusion protein in n. benthamiana . the overlay of atgalt29a-mcer <dig> with the co-expressed golgi marker protein, sttmd-yfp  <cit>  indicated its localization to the golgi apparatus.

previously, atgalt31a and atglcat14a were also shown to be localized to the golgi apparatus  <cit> . atgalt29a-yfp was co-localized with atgalt31a-mcer <dig> to a high degree , while atgalt29a-mcer <dig> and atglcat14a-yfp were only partially co-localized . next, we tested protein-protein interaction within and between atgalt29a and atgalt31a using the fret acceptor photobleaching technique for these proteins tagged with either mcer <dig> or yfp ectopically expressed in n. benthamiana <cit> . fret from mcer <dig>  to yfp  happens when the two fluorescent proteins are closer than 10 nm, indicative of interaction between the tagged proteins. bleaching of the acceptor yfp allows measuring absolute fret efficiency in a self-controlled manner  <cit> , so values above  <dig> definitely indicate molecular interaction between the tagged proteins. when the homodimeric combinations  were tested, fret efficiencies of 19% and 34% were assessed, respectively , indicating the formation of homodimers for both atgalt31a and atgalt29a. when atgalt31a-mcer3 + atgalt29a-yfp and atgalt29a-mcer3 + atgalt31a-yfp were co-expressed, fret efficiencies of 18% and 29% were detected, respectively, indicating the formation of heterodimers between atgalt29a and atgalt31a . therefore we observed positive interactions for all combinations tested , but differences in the values of fret efficiencies are evident, when these are calculated on a pixel-by-pixel analysis. when atgalt29a is the donor , fret efficiencies are overall higher  compared to the combinations when atgalt31a is the donor . thus, atgalt31a-mcer <dig> is either less able to dimerize than atgalt29a-mcer <dig> under the experimental conditions, or is in a conformation which is less efficient as a donor. nevertheless, when we use the same donor , and compare fret efficiencies for homo and heterodimerization, we obtain roughly the same fret efficiency for homo and heterodimers. for atgalt29a-mcer3/atgalt29a-yfp and atgalt29a-mcer3/atgalt31a-yfp we obtain 34% and 29%, , indicating that the atgalt29a-mcer3/atgalt31a-yfp heterodimer is preferred to the atgalt29a homodimer, since in spite of the possibility of homodimer formation in the atgalt29a-mcer3/atgalt31a-yfp system, which could decrease fret by incorrect donor/acceptor pairing, we still have the same level of fret efficiency as when we have only atgalt29a. the same tendency is also observed when atgalt31a-mcer is the donor .

overall, our results indicate the formation of homodimers for both atgalt31a and atgalt29a as well as that of heterodimers between them when these two gts were expressed simultaneously. the indicated interactions are unlikely to be due to an overexpression artifact since atgalt31a and atglcat14a did not interact under the same experimental set up  <cit> . atgalt29a also interacted with atglcat14a when the two proteins were co-localized . but, since atgalt29a and atglcat14a were only occasionally co-localized, occurrence of the interaction between these two proteins is considered to be of less importance than that between atgalt29a and atgalt31a.

atgalt31a is co-purified with atgalt29a as an enzyme complex and increases the level of galactose incorporation into the type ii ag acceptors
since fret analysis indicated molecular interactions between atgalt31a and atgalt29a , we tried to purify the enzyme complex and investigated galt activity when atgalt29a is alone or in a complex with atgalt31a. we expressed atgalt31a as a c-terminal gfp fusion protein  and atgalt29a as an n-terminally ha tagged protein  in n. benthamiana, and immunoprecipitated the enzyme complex using an anti-gfp antibody . when atgalt31a-gfp was expressed alone, it was immunoprecipitated as a band of ca. 70 kda using western blot analysis with the same antibody . the corresponding band was also detected in the immunoprecipitated material using anti-ha resin from the co-expression sample of both proteins . this indicates co-purification of atgalt31a with atgalt29a using a tag on atgalt29a, thus the complex formation indicated by the fret analysis was also confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation . the band around 50 kda detected in lanes 3- <dig> is the heavy chain of the ha antibody used for immunoprecipitation, which was somehow detected by the secondary antibody in the western blot analysis.

we attempted to evaluate the purity of the protein complex by eluting the immobilized complex from the anti-ha agarose slurry using low ph buffer as recommended by the manufacturer; however, the majority of the proteins were not eluted to the buffer in an amount detectable by western blot analysis . when the immunoprecipitated samples collected on anti-ha antibody-agarose were directly subjected to sds-page and analyzed by the western blot, we could detect the recombinant proteins .

using the immunoprecipitated enzyme complex, we investigated galt activity in the biosynthesis of type ii ag using udp--gal as donor-substrate and sp32-gfp as acceptor, which is microsomes prepared from n. benthamiana after expression of a consensus motifs for ag glycosylation, repetitive ser-pro  <cit> . this material contains various ag oligosaccharides similarly as detected in gagp <dig> . the protein complex containing atgalt29a and atgalt31a exhibited a higher level of -gal incorporation to the sp32-gfp acceptor compared to atgalt29a alone . while such an increase was not observed for the combination of atgalt31a/atglcat14a and atgalt29a/atglcat14a , indicating the increase of enzyme activity is specific by the combination between atgalt29a and atgalt31a.

moreover, the enzyme complex showed higher levels of -gal incorporation also towards β- <dig> -galactan acceptor by the enzyme complex compared to atgalt29a alone . the results indicate an increase of galt activity towards both sp32-gfp and β- <dig> -galactan ag acceptors by the enzyme complex containing atgalt31a and atgalt29a when compared to a single enzyme.

the enzyme complex containing atgalt31a and atgalt29a exhibited increased β- <dig> -galt activity adding gal residues at o <dig> positions of β- <dig> -galactan and to β- <dig> -galactan
the sp32-gfp and β- <dig> -galactan used in figure  <dig> are composed of heterogeneous oligosaccharides: sp32-gfp prepared from microsomes consists of various components with different molecular size  and contains β- <dig> -galactan side chains of a degree of polymerization  from  <dig> to at least  <dig>  as well as unsubstituted β- <dig> -linked galactan  <cit> . in contrast, β- <dig> -galactan acceptor is approximately 25 kda and consists mostly of unsubstituted β- <dig> -galactan  with trace amount of β- <dig> -linked gal  <cit> . galactose could be incorporated in the agp molecule at different sites: at o <dig> of β- <dig> -galactan , at o <dig> of β- <dig> -galactan  and/or o <dig> of β- <dig> -galactan . we investigated the site of the -gal incorporation catalyzed by the recombinant proteins among the above mentioned possibilities by treating the -gal incorporated products made onto sp32-gfp and β- <dig> -galactan with structure-specific hydrolases and subsequent size exclusion chromatography . the endo-β- <dig> -galactanase and exo-β- <dig> -galactanase used in this study specifically cleave unsubstituted β- <dig> -linked galactooligosaccharides of dp <dig> or longer  <cit>  and β- <dig> -linked galactose regardless the presence of substitutions  <cit> , respectively.

from the product made onto sp32-gfp, the treatment with endo-β- <dig> -galactanase alone released large amounts of material eluting in the void volume, as well as small oligosaccharides with a peak at fraction  <dig>  corresponding to dp2- <dig>  from both the atgalt31a/atgalt29a complex and atgalt29a alone . the material in the void volume in figure 6a was almost completely digested by co-treatment with endo-β- <dig> -galactanase and α-arabinofuranosidase , indicating a part of -gal incorporation occurred at the β- <dig> -linked galactans substituted with ara, and that ara substitution sterically hindered the action of endo-β- <dig> -galactanase  <cit> . the results indicate that both the enzyme complex and atgalt29a alone incorporated -gal to both ara-substituted and non-substituted β- <dig> -galactans, and the level of total gal incorporation to both types of acceptors was much higher with atgalt29a in a complex with atgalt31a. atgalt31a was previously characterized using radish agp as acceptor for the incorporation of -gal and the product was digested by endo-β- <dig> -galactanase  <cit> . we tested the galt activity of atgalt31a using sp32-gfp acceptor used in this study and showed that the level of activity of atgalt31a alone was lower than the level observed for the atgalt29a alone . hence, the overall results indicate a cooperative action of galt activity in elongating β- <dig> -galactan of type ii ag by forming an enzyme complex containing atgalt29a and atgalt31a.

treatment with exo-β- <dig> -galactanase to the products made onto sp32-gfp released small oligosaccharides eluting at fraction  <dig> and  <dig> as a peak by atgalt29a alone and by atgalt29a in a complex with atgalt31a, respectively . both fractions contained galactobiose as the major component analyzed by tlc, but the amount was much higher from the product made by the atgalt29a/atgalt31a complex . since exo-β- <dig> -galactanase cleaves β- <dig> -linked gal, the detected galactobiose is likely β- <dig> -linked single gal substituted onto β- <dig> -linked gal. thus, the results indicate that both atgalt29a alone and the atgalt29a/atgalt31a complex likely transfer gal to o <dig> position of β- <dig> -linked galactan, and that the amounts of -gal transfer was higher by the atgalt29a/atgalt31a complex.

the galt activity towards β- <dig> -linked gal was further investigated using β- <dig> -galactan as acceptor . when the products made on β- <dig> -galactan were treated with exo-β- <dig> -galactanase  <cit> , the main peak appeared at fraction  <dig>  and much more -gal containing compound was released from the product made by atgalt29a/atgalt31a complex compared to atgalt29a alone. the major component released was galactobiose as indicated by tlc  and the higher level of -galactobiose was detected from the product produced by the atgalt29a/atgalt31a complex, which is consistent with the result obtained from sp32-gfp analysis . therefore, we confirmed that the galt activity onto β- <dig> -galactan is mainly a branch forming activity  and this activity is significantly increased by the atgalt29a/atgalt31a complex compared to atgalt29a alone.

taken together, analysis of the enzymatic activities indicates that atgalt29a alone has a β- <dig> -galt activity for elongating β- <dig> -galactan and forming 6-gal branches on β- <dig> -galactan, and these activities are significantly increased when atgalt29a is in a complex with atgalt31a.

n. benthamiana microsomes showed increased galactose incorporation to endogenous type ii ags after co-expression of atgalt31a and atgalt29a
since in vitro analysis suggested an increase of the enzyme activity when atgalt29a is in a complex with atgalt31a, we also studied possible in vivo effects of co-expression of atgalt31a and atgalt29a for agp glycosylation activity in n. benthamiana. we isolated microsomes after co-expression of both proteins and tested incorporation of exogenously added udp--gal to endogenous type ii ag, mediated via endogenous udp-gal transporter and galts present in the lumenal side of vesicles  <cit> . the synthesis of type ii ag products was investigated by -gal incorporated polysaccharide materials precipitated by 70% ethanol , or by type ii ag precipitated by the β-gal-yariv reagent . in both cases, the results indicated a higher level of gal incorporation to the polysaccharide materials and β-gal-yariv precipitates in the microsomes after co-expression of atgalt31a and atgalt29a compared to expression of each. thus, the co-expression of atgalt31a and atgalt29a in n. benthamiana increases the gal incorporation activity to endogenous type ii ag materials in isolated microsomes.

discussion
identification of glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of type ii arabinogalactan
in this paper we have shown that the protein encoded by arabidopsis at1g <dig> gene is a β- <dig> -galt that is involved in the glycosylation of type ii ag. we hypothesized that the enzyme is a putative gt involved in the biosynthesis of type ii ag based on co-expression analysis together with two other gt genes previously identified in the same glycosylation pathway   <cit> . this may appear surprising since the gt belongs to the gt <dig> family and the protein sequence encoded by at1g <dig> contains ‘sialyl motifs’ conserved in sialyltransferases in mammals and fungi  <cit> . sialyltransferase activity was previously tested for the protein encoded by at1g <dig> and concluded to be negative  <cit> . apparently the sialyl motifs do not work as independent domains, since a chimeric protein constructed with a sequence encoded by arabidopsis at3g <dig> and the sialyl motifs from human sialyltransferase did not result in sialyltransferase activity  <cit> . the gt <dig> proteins from arabidopsis  and rice  share homologous sequences and all contain putative sialyl motifs; however, only two of the rice proteins demonstrated sialyltransferase-like activity  <cit> , while two arabidopsis proteins did not  <cit> . thus, proteins harboring sialyl motifs apparently do not necessarily encode an enzyme with sialyltransferase activity.

it is difficult to predict the biochemical activity of putative gts by analyzing the primary sequences, but co-expression studies based on genome-wide expression data in a. thaliana   <cit>  were useful in identifying putative candidate gts involved in type ii ag biosynthesis. we selected atglcat14a and atgalt29a based on the co-expression profile with atgalt31a and characterized as biosynthetic enzymes involved in type ii ag glycosylation. co-expression analysis using genes encoding the protein core for type ii ag modification as markers has been established  <cit> , which may be a good resource to investigate the rest of the pathway. in order to identify the biochemical activity of the putative gt candidates, we established screening methods to cover broad activities expected to be involved in the biosynthesis of type ii ag . we found microsomal materials after expression of syngms in n. benthamiana quite useful for donor substrate identification as they contain a mixture of various oligosaccharides present in type ii ag. otherwise, structure-defined oligosaccharides are difficult to obtain from commercial sources, and even if available, they are expensive and only useful for a specific gt assay. using the microsomal materials mentioned above as the acceptor mixture, we screened donor substrates for the recombinant enzyme expressed in n. benthamiana. the strategy worked for the characterization of atgalt31a  <cit> , atglcat14a  <cit> , and atgalt29a , and is expected to be useful to analyze other unidentified gts in the type ii ag glycosylation pathway.

in this paper, we reported that atgalt29a possesses β- <dig> -galt activities for elongating β- <dig> -galactan and forming 6-gal branches on β- <dig> -galactan. furthermore, atgalt29a forms enzyme complex together with atgalt31a, and the complex showed significantly higher level of β- <dig> -galt activities exhibited by atgalt29a alone.

impact of the protein complexes in the glycosylation processes
based mainly on the studies using yeast and mammalian enzymes, evidence of protein-protein interactions among gts has been accumulated, namely, that several gts can form homomeric complexes with themselves and/or interact with other gts or non-gt proteins via heteromeric complexes . the complex formation is considered to serve various biological significances, e.g., activate/stabilize the catalytic activity, alternate the substrate specificity, allow proper targeting, and control the localization in er/golgi apparatus. in addition, the clusters of gts are considered to be an assembly line for the efficient and accurate production of certain glycoforms by substrate channeling . in plants, evidence for protein-protein interactions between gts in the secretory pathway are emerging for the biosynthesis of pectin , xyloglucan   <cit> , glucuronoarabinoxylan   <cit> , and protein n-glycosylation   <cit> . a putative interaction is also implicated from the cooperative activity and/or co-expression profile in the biosynthesis of galactomannan   <cit> , xylan   <cit>  and mannan   <cit> . the interaction of gaut <dig> to gaut <dig> has been demonstrated to be important to target catalytic domain of gaut <dig> to the golgi  <cit> , but besides this study, little is known for the significance of forming protein complex among gts in plants.

in this paper, we evidently demonstrate the presence of homodimeric interactions between for both, atgalt29a and atgalt31a by fret analysis, and do this also for heterodimeric ones between atgalt31a and atgalt29a, when these proteins were ectopically expressed in n. benthamiana leaves . moreover, atgalt31a-yfp could biochemically be co-immunoprecipitated using ha antibody against ha epitope tagged n-terminally to atgalt29a , and the protein complex containing atgalt31a-yfp and ha-atgalt29a exhibited an increased level of β- <dig> -galt activities compared to ha-atgalt29a alone . therefore, the complex formation may have a regulatory role in the β- <dig> -galactan biosynthesis in type ii ag. accordingly, the present study offers one of the few examples showing a biological significance in the molecular interaction between gts in plants. it is conceivable that the regulation of biosynthesis via formation of protein complexes among biosynthetic enzymes is faster than transcriptional regulation, and that this mode allows determining subtle changes of cell-surface type ii ag structures during cell differentiation in plants. how common such a system for other gts involved in the biosynthesis of type ii ag remains to be elucidated.

according to different levels of fret efficiencies among different combination of atglat29a and atglat31a, tagged with mcer <dig> and yfp and reciprocally, respectively, we suggest that atgalt31a is less capable of dimerization, while atgalt29a forms dimers more effectively than atgalt31a. furthermore, formation of heterodimers between atgalt31a and atgalt29a seems to be more dominant than that of homodimers when both atgalt31a and atgalt29a are available. with increasing probability we suggest occurrence of dimerization in following sequence: atgalt31a monomer, atgalt31a homodimer, atgalt29a homodimer, and finally atgalt31a/atgalt29a heterodimer.

since the fret efficiencies might be influenced by the protein stoichiometry in the golgi stacks, we tried to quantify the proteins expressed ectopically in n. benthamiana, but failed because of the low level of protein expression. we could not detect the expressed proteins in n. benthamiana microsomes analyzed by sds-page followed by western blot. neither did native-page lead to detectable amounts in western blots . therefore we could neither normalize the fret efficiencies based on the protein concentration nor detect protein complexes under the experimental condition used. however, acceptor photobleaching, which is the method used for calculating the fret efficiencies in the present study, is quite robust against differences in expression of the two fret partners, when compared to sensitized emission  <cit> . eventually, immunoprecipitation of the proteins in microsomes from n. benthamiana allowed us to detect the recombinant proteins by western blot analysis .

CONCLUSIONS
the atgalt29a  from arabidopsis thaliana encodes a β- <dig> -galt involved in the biosynthesis of type ii ag by heterologous expression of the protein in n. benthamiana and the biochemical enzyme assay. when expressed simultaneously, atgalt29a interacted with atgalt31a, and the enzyme complex exhibited substantially increased level of β- <dig> -galt activities compared to atgalt29a alone. the complex formation could be an important regulatory mechanism for producing β- <dig> -galactan side chains of type ii ag during plant development.
