BACKGROUND
lipopolysaccharide  induces a very complex host response through toll-like receptor   <dig> in macrophages. among these responses, the production of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor  and interleukin - <dig> as well as reactive oxygen species such as nitric oxide  play important roles in protecting the host against bacterial infection. lps binds to the tlr4/md <dig> complex. ligand binding leads to the recruitment of adaptor molecules such as myd <dig> and trif. myd <dig> signals through a complex signaling cascade leading to phosphorylation of the nf-κb inhibitor iκb. iκb is degraded and nf-κb released in the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor for inflammatory response genes. in addition myd <dig> signaling activates map kinases such as p <dig>  jnk and erk which are also involved in this proinflammatory response. trif-mediated signaling which is elicited by binding of lps to tlr- <dig> or dsrna to tlr- <dig> leads to the activation of transcription factors such as irf- <dig> which binds to isre elements and induces ifn-β - <dig>  ifit- <dig> but also amplifies the expression of myd <dig> dependent genes such as il- <dig> p <dig>  il- <dig> or tnf-α   <cit> , sepsis  <cit>  or contribute to pathogenesis of bacterial infections  <cit> . meanwhile many type i interferon induced genes have been described  <cit> , but it is only partially understood how they contribute to effector functions of type i interferons.

ifit- <dig>  and ifit- <dig>  are induced in response to type i and type ii interferons, dsrna, lps, viral  <cit>  and bacterial infections  <cit>  and they are also found in several chronic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease   <cit>  or sle. human ifit- <dig> and ifit- <dig> as well as mouse ifit- <dig> and ifit- <dig> are linked genes and located either on human chromosome  <dig> or mouse chromosome  <dig> <cit> . the encoded ifit- <dig> and ifit- <dig> proteins are related and contain multiple tetratricopeptide-repeat  motifs. it was demonstrated that ifit- <dig> and ifit- <dig> inhibit translation initiation by inhibiting the action of the eif <dig> protein complex  <cit> . human ifit- <dig> binds to eif3e and blocks the ability of eif <dig> to stabilize the ternary complex of eif <dig>  gtp and met-trna. mouse ifit- <dig> and mouse ifit- <dig> bind to eif3c and block the ability of eif <dig> to promote formation of the  <dig> s pre-initiation complex containing the  <dig> s ribosomal subunit, the ternary complex, eif4f and mrna  <cit> . nevertheless so far no genes have been described which are actually negatively regulated by ifit- <dig>  to define genes inhibited by mouse ifit- <dig> we generated a stable cell line which constitutively expresses ifit- <dig>  our findings suggest that the 3'utr of certain transcripts determines the selectivity for ifit- <dig> mediated inhibition of protein expression in raw <dig>  cells.

RESULTS
ifit- <dig> selectively inhibits lps induced protein expression
to confirm previous findings that lps and interferons induce ifit- <dig> protein expression raw <dig>  macrophages were stimulated for different time periods with lps, ifn-β, pam3cys or ifn-γ . all used stimuli induced ifit- <dig> expression but showed differences in the time course of ifit- <dig> expression. thus, while ifn-β induced ifit- <dig> expression already  <dig> hours after stimulation, strong ifit expression was detectable  <dig> hours after lps stimulation and  <dig> hours after ifn-γ or pam3cys stimulation. immunofluorescence staining of raw <dig>  cells showed that ifit- <dig> was located in the cytoplasm .

blocking of the ifn-α/β receptor with specific antibodies against the mouse ifn-α/β receptor subunit  <dig>  demonstrated that lps, pam3cys and ifn-γ induced ifit- <dig> expression is dependent on endogenous production of type i interferons . as a control, blocking antibody against the human ifn-γr  was used. this data indicates that ifit- <dig> seems to be induced in a specifically type i interferon dependent manner.

impact of forced ifit- <dig> expression on protein expression
in previous reports it was demonstrated that ifit- <dig> interacts with eif-3c, interferes with translation initiation and inhibits protein synthesis. so far it was unclear whether ifit- <dig> affects protein synthesis globally or in a selective manner. to address this question raw <dig>  macrophages were stably transfected with an ifit- <dig> expression vector. the resulting cells  were viable and showed no obvious defect in proliferation. constitutive ifit- <dig> expression was detectable .

to define genes which may be potentially regulated by ifit- <dig>  raw <dig>  and raw-ifit- <dig> cells were stimulated with lps and tnf-α, il- <dig>  mip- <dig>  and vegf secretion was determined .

stimulation of raw  <dig>  macrophages led to a dose-dependent increase of tnf-α secretion. forced ifit- <dig> expression reduced lps induced tnf-α secretion by more than 90% indicating that ifit- <dig> overexpression affects lps induced tnf-α secretion. tnf-α secretion in raw  <dig>  cells stably transfected with the empty vector pef4/v5-his a was comparable to raw  <dig>  macrophages after lps stimulation .

in similar, ifit- <dig> overexpression significantly reduced mip- <dig> secretion , and il- <dig> secretion , as detected by elisa. in contrast, vegf secretion was not affected. by using immunoblots the protein expression of several other lps induced proteins such as ifit- <dig> and egr- <dig> was determined prior to and after lps stimulation at different time points. since egr- <dig> expression is predominantly found in the nucleus, protein expression of egr- <dig> was determined in nuclear extracts. ifit- <dig> and egr- <dig> were similarly expressed at indicated time points in ifit- <dig> and parental raw macrophages , which was also confirmed by quantification of the band intensities of immunoblots. thus, quantification of egr- <dig> expression  <dig> h after lps stimulation revealed a ratio of egr- <dig> found in raw <dig>  compared to raw-ifit- <dig> cells of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  : <dig> .

taken together, our data indicate that forced ifit- <dig> expression affects lps induced protein expression in a selective manner.

ifit- <dig> does not affect substantially lps induced signal transduction
to investigate whether ifit- <dig> overexpression also affects lps mediated signal transduction raw  <dig>  and raw-ifit- <dig> cells were stimulated with lps for different time periods and immunoblots were performed to determine phosphorylation of erk, jnk, p <dig> and iκb using specific antibodies. as a control total amounts of erk, jnk, p <dig>  iκb as well as actin were determined . band intensities of three experiments were quantified, normalized to actin and compared for each time point between raw <dig>  and raw-ifit <dig> cells. slight differences were found for phosphorylated iκb  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minutes after lps stimulation  and for phosphorylated p <dig> only  <dig> minutes after stimulation . taken together, ifit- <dig> overexpression did not or did only marginally affect phosphorylation of the investigated signaling molecules. in addition, the expression patterns of the total amounts of these proteins over time after lps stimulation showed only small variations . these data suggest that ifit- <dig> overexpression does not affect substantially lps mediated signal transduction.

ifit- <dig> decreases lps induced tnf-α mrna expression by affecting mrna stability
if ifit- <dig> only affected protein expression, lps induced tnf-α mrna expression would be expected to be similar in raw and raw-ifit- <dig> cells. to investigate whether mrna expression is affected by ifit- <dig>  raw <dig>  and raw-ifit- <dig> cells were stimulated and ifit- <dig> and tnf-α mrna expression was determined by real-time rt-pcr . while lps induced ifit- <dig> mrna expression was not affected by ifit- <dig> overexpression, tnf-α mrna expression levels were decreased significantly up to two-fold four and six hours after stimulation.

to assess whether mrna stability was affected by ifit- <dig> overexpression, raw <dig>  and raw-ifit- <dig> clones were stimulated with lps for  <dig> hours. subsequently cells were treated with actinomycin d and mrna expression was determined by real-time pcr at different time points . the stability of tnf-α mrna was significantly decreased in raw ifit- <dig> cells. the half-life of tnf-α mrna in lps stimulated raw <dig>  cells  was approximately two-fold higher than in raw-ifit- <dig> cells . this finding explains the differences in tnf-α mrna levels found between lps stimulated raw <dig>  and raw-ifit- <dig> cells but not the differences in protein expression levels.

our data indicate that forced ifit- <dig> expression selectively affects mrna stability and protein expression of some genes, e.g. tnf-α. this raised the question by which mechanism ifit- <dig> specifically affects protein expression.

characteristics of the 3'utr of transcripts specify ifit- <dig> mediated control of protein expression
previous studies showed that distinct elements in the 3'utr such as the gait element which was found in the 3'utr of ceruloplasmin play an important role for translational control  <cit> . therefore we hypothesized that the 3' utr of transcripts might determine the selectivity of ifit- <dig> to inhibit protein synthesis. to investigate whether characteristics of different 3'utrs may be important for ifit- <dig> mediated inhibition of protein expression, raw  <dig>  and raw-ifit- <dig> cells were co-transfected with an expression vector expressing cherry flanked by a polya signal but without 3'utr  and different expression vectors encoding for egfp flanked by no 3'utr , the tnf-α, mip- <dig>  il- <dig>  ifit- <dig> or vegf 3'utr. subsequently cherry and egfp expression was determined by flow cytometry . to ensure that only transfected cells were investigated, only cells were analyzed which expressed cherry. the mean fluorescence for egfp expression was comparable in raw <dig>  and raw-ifit- <dig> cells if an egfp expression vector was used flanked by no 3'utr. transfection experiments using egfp constructs flanked by the 3'utr of tnf-α, il- <dig> and mip- <dig> revealed that egfp expression was approximately 70% reduced in raw-ifit- <dig> compared to raw <dig>  cells. in contrast the 3'utrs of ifit- <dig> and vegf had only a minor effect on egfp expression. these data indicate that the 3'utr plays an important role for the specificity of ifit- <dig> to inhibit protein expression in raw macrophages. one of the best studied 3'utrs is the tnf-α 3'utr and regions are defined which are important for posttranscriptional regulation such as the au-rich region  which controls mrna decay and translation and the constitutive decay element  which also affects mrna stability  <cit> .

to define a distinct element in the 3'utr of tnf-α, raw <dig>  and raw-ifit- <dig> cells were transfected with constructs encoding egfp flanked by deletion mutants of the 3'utr of tnf-α . egfp expression was significantly reduced by more than 70% in ifit- <dig> cells compared to raw <dig>  cells using the constructs tnf 862– <dig>  and tnf 1340– <dig> . since p <dig> lacks the proximal part of the 3'utr including the au-rich region one can conclude that the are plays no role for the ifit- <dig> mediated inhibition of expression. in contrast, transfection with tnf 862– <dig>  resulted in a similar gfp expression in both raw <dig>  and raw-ifit- <dig> cells indicating that the distal part of the 3'utr containing the cde element is essential for ifit- <dig> mediated inhibition of expression.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
previous studies demonstrated that ifit- <dig> is highly expressed after stimulation with lps as well as interferons. our findings confirm these studies and show that lps as well as ifn-γ induced ifit- <dig> expression is dependent on endogenous secretion of type i interferons. therefore one can assume that ifit- <dig> may represent an effector protein which may be responsible for some of the effects which are associated with type i interferon function.

although ifit- <dig> has been known for quite a long time and is strongly expressed in many diseases such as sle, inflammatory bowel diseases, and viral or bacterial infections, little is known about the biological function of this protein. recently it was demonstrated that mifit- <dig> inhibits translation by binding to eif-3c, interferes with translation initiation and inhibits protein synthesis at least in in vitro translation assays  <cit> . although these studies clearly showed that ifit- <dig> could be involved in regulation of protein synthesis it was so far totally unclear whether ifit- <dig> affects protein expression in a global or selective manner.

the presented study may shed some light on the function of ifit- <dig>  as shown here forced ifit- <dig> expression does not globally affect protein expression but acts in a more specific manner. we could identify several proteins which are induced by lps and which are inhibited in protein expression by forced ifit- <dig> expression. examination of lps triggered phosphorylation of signal molecules of tlr- <dig> signaling pathways in cells with or without forced ifit- <dig> expression excludes that ifit- <dig> substantially affects signal transduction. this data indicates that the principal mechanism of ifit- <dig> mediated inhibition of lps triggered cytokine secretion is for instance different to the negative regulation mediated by fln <dig>  <cit> . fln <dig> which is induced eight hours after lps stimulation in a trif-dependent manner interacts with traf <dig> and inhibits iκb and erk phosphorylation after restimulation with lps. thus, our data using cells overexpressing ifit- <dig> argue against the possibility that lps induced ifit- <dig> may affect prominently signal transduction of the tested pathways as it was demonstrated for fln <dig>  <cit> . as shown for tnf-α as an example, forced ifit- <dig> overexpression in raw cells affects to some extent mrna expression. actinomycin d treatment shows that reduced tnf-α mrna expression is associated with reduced mrna stability. this data strongly argues that ifit- <dig> overexpression mediates reduced mrna stability and therefore acts posttranscriptionally. nevertheless, we cannot totally rule out that to some extent also transcription might be affected. since tnf-α mrna expression is only reduced up to 50%, reduced mrna stability does not totally explain reduced protein expression. therefore, we conclude that forced ifit- <dig> expression may act at different levels of posttranscriptional regulation. at this point we do not know whether these processes act separately or are linked together. since not all proteins and especially not all lps induced proteins are affected by forced ifit- <dig> expression we initiated studies to determine possible mechanisms for the action of ifit- <dig> 

several other reports pointed out that specific translational control is determined by distinct elements in the 3'utr to which proteins bind and this interaction of rna binding proteins with distinct sequence stretches mediates translational silencing. for instance it was described that ifn-γ stimulation leads to formation of the gait protein complex consisting of four proteins which bind to distinct stem loops in the 3'utr of ceruloplasmin  <cit> . these interactions interfere with translation initiation. therefore we wanted to investigate whether the characteristics of 3'utrs of the genes we addressed in this study discriminate whether ifit- <dig> mediates inhibition of protein expression or not.

by transfection of plasmids expressing egfp flanked by different 3'utrs in raw <dig>  and raw-ifit- <dig> cells we could demonstrate that ifit- <dig> affects egfp expression dependent on the 3'utr attached to the coding sequence of egfp. consistent with decreased tnf-α, mip- <dig> and il- <dig> secretion after lps stimulation in raw-ifit- <dig> cells, 3'utrs of tnf-α, mip- <dig> and il- <dig> mediated lower egfp expression in raw-ifit- <dig> cells compared to raw <dig>  cells. in contrast, the 3'utrs of ifit- <dig> or vegf did not influence egfp expression in raw-ifit- <dig> cells. we conclude that specific properties of the 3'utrs determine whether ifit- <dig> affects protein expression of a certain gene or not. there is already detailed knowledge about different elements of the tnf-3'utr for the posttranscriptional regulation. thus, the au-rich elements  are important for posttranscriptional regulation. when inserted into reporter constructs, the are of tnf-α induces processive deadenylation of the mrna and efficiently targets the body of the transcript for rapid degradation  <cit> . in addition, the are of tnf-α inhibits stable association with the  <dig> s ribosomal subunit and prevents translation  <cit> . decay is mediated through binding of the zinc finger protein tristetraprolin  to the are, as shown with ttp-deficient mice which show elevated levels of tnf-α due to an increase in the mrna half-life  <cit> . additional proteins such as hur and tia- <dig> interact with the are and influence mrna stability and translation  <cit> . in addition the constitutive decay element  was described which constitutively mediates decay of tnf-α mrna  <cit> . however no proteins were so far described which may bind to the cde element.

our experiments using raw <dig>  and raw-ifit- <dig> cells transfected with egfp constructs flanked by different 3'utrs clearly indicate that the characteristics of the 3'utrs define whether forced ifit- <dig> expression can mediate inhibition of protein expression or not. deletion of parts of the 3'utr of tnf-α revealed that the distal part of the 3'utr containing the cde element is sufficient for ifit- <dig> mediated inhibition of protein expression while the are element has no impact. how ifit- <dig> controls protein expression via 3'utrs remains to be elucidated in further studies. taken together, our data suggest that ifit- <dig> acts as a regulatory protein which may repress the protein expression of distinct genes.

at this point, however, the number of proteins which may be affected by ifit- <dig> is not known. therefore, it is hard to predict how this function of ifit- <dig> may translate finally into in vivo function of ifit- <dig> as an interferon induced effector protein. in further studies it is necessary to investigate the in vivo function of ifit- <dig> by additional tools such as ifit- <dig> knock-out mice.
