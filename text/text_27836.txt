BACKGROUND
species exist in a multi-dimensional niche space with dimensions representing their environmental habitat, their geographical location, and their presence in time. within this space, each species occupies a volume with a specific shape and size. some species may occur as relatively tight clusters, if they have a strict habitat preference , are incapable of distant migration , and quickly go extinct . other species persist, forming large structured networks in niche space. one example of the latter is vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera that has persisted globally for centuries in clinical as well as environmental habitats.

here, we ask the question which elements of the v. cholerae genome reflect its structured occurrence in each of the three niche dimensions. glimpses of an answer can be found in the literature. for example, a recent phylogeographic analysis distinguished two gene pools  <cit> : the vertically inherited core genome and horizontally acquired mobile or mobilizable elements. these mobile elements sweep through local subpopulations of environmental vibrio species that occupy the same geographical niche, leading to geographic structuring  <cit> . temporal structuring of the v. cholerae genome was shown in a large-scale sequencing effort of v. cholerae strains from the sixth  and seventh  cholera pandemics  <cit> , that identified genomic elements characterizing the different temporal waves of the pandemic. finally, habitat occupancy is mainly regulated by the presence of two phage-encoded factors. clinical, epidemic v. cholerae strains differ from non-pathogenic environmental ones depending on the presence of the toxin co-regulated pilus  that allows the bacterium to colonize the gut and form protective aggregates; and cholera toxin , encoded by the phage ctxφ, which uses the tcp to attach to the bacterium  <cit> .

we have recently outlined an approach for genome-wide association of genotypes to phenotypes  that is capable of exploiting large-scale draft genome sequencing  <cit> . here, we employ this approach for the data-driven discovery of genomic elements that structure v. cholerae across the niche dimensions space, time, and habitat. our approach classifies the bacterial strains by phenotype by using random forest  machine learning  <cit> , identifying which genomic elements are most important for the classification. while consistently annotated phenotypes are often lacking for sequenced bacterial strains  <cit> , niche metadata are readily available for most publically available genome sequences, allowing us to include  <dig> published complete and draft genomes in our analysis. moreover, we sequenced  <dig> additional genomes using the new ion torrent personal genome machine  benchtop sequencer  <cit>  to obtain a more complete sampling of the niche dimensions. we identify how the genomic landscape of v. cholerae, consisting of genotypic variables including snps, protein families, functions, and phages varies across the major niche dimensions time, space, and habitat.

RESULTS
vibrio choleraegenomes across niche dimensions
using a total of  <dig> draft genome sequences, we set out to identify genomic attributes that render v. cholerae persistent across the niche dimensions of time, space, and habitat. we included 31 v. cholerae genomes present in the public genome database seed  <cit> , as well as  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  <cit>  and one  <cit>  additional v. cholerae genomes that were recently sequenced. to complement these and provide a more balanced sampling of the niche dimensions, we selected an additional 39 v. cholerae strains for ion torrent sequencing from the bacteria culture collection of environment and health at the oswaldo cruz foundation . together, these strains provide a good cross-section of environmental and clinical sources , different geographical regions , and sampling dates .figure  <dig>

the ion torrent platform  <cit>  was used to sequence the strains to an estimated  <dig>  ±  <dig> % coverage , satisfactory for the accepted standard of high quality draft genomes  <cit> . v. cholerae is endemic in southeast asia and most of the strains with completely sequenced genomes originated there . v. cholerae strain r- <dig>  an el tor strain isolated in asia  and a representative of the asiatic seventh pandemic, was sequenced very deeply  using a combination of shotgun and long mate pair techniques. the genome was assembled into two major scaffolds, each representing one of the two chromosomes. figure  <dig> displays the two r- <dig> chromosomes and their annotation, as well as the mapping of the remaining  <dig> genomes sequenced in this study.figure  <dig>

breadth of the strains based on genome-wide marker snps
to illustrate the breadth of the sampled strains, we mapped  <dig>  previously identified marker snps from the sixth and seventh pandemic  <cit>  to our genomes. a snp-based phylogenomic tree  confirms the three waves of the seventh pandemic described previously  <cit> . moreover, several clusters reflect local epidemics, as shown by isolates from the same geographical area and time clustering together in the tree. examples include strains isolated in mozambique from  <dig>  strains isolated in africa from  <dig> to  <dig> and strains isolated in bangladesh and vietnam from  <dig> to  <dig>  in  <dig>  a new serogroup of v. cholerae, o <dig>  was identified as the cause of epidemic cholera in bangladesh and india  <cit> . the o <dig> serogroup was genetically derived from the o <dig> el tor pandemic strain after changing its antigenic structure  <cit> . however, we confirm here that the o <dig> strains evolved independently from the el tor pandemic strains, as evidenced by the tight v. cholerae o <dig> cluster. the cluster of genomes containing the west africa-south america  phage is supported by 100% of the bootstrap iterations. interestingly, another genome from africa  is at the root of the wasa cluster, providing additional support for the relation of south american and west african strains as shown previously  <cit> . our tree also shows that our strain vc <dig>  isolated in september/october  <dig> in nigeria is closely related to the strains from the cholera outbreak in haiti and nepal of that year . in conjunction with previous observations  <cit> , this suggests the existence of a lineage causing recent cholera outbreaks in asia, africa and haiti.figure  <dig>

identifying genomic structuring by random forest
metadata describing the three niche dimensions were collected for all v. cholerae strains . this data includes the location  and year  of sampling, as well as information about the clinical or environmental source of the strain . to obtain consistent genotypic annotations, all 274 v. cholerae genomes were re-annotated as explained in methods. annotated genotypic variables making up the genomic landscape of v. cholerae included the presence of protein families identified with cd-hit  <cit> , genome-wide snps  <cit> , functions and subsystems annotated by rast  and phages identified by using phispy  <cit>  and homology searches . monotonous variables were removed and variables with redundant, highly correlating profiles were merged, yielding a total of  <dig>  informative, non-redundant genotypic variables. where possible, variables were assigned to the seed level- <dig> subsystems  <cit> , providing consistent, low-level annotations .table  <dig> 
summary of the genotypic variables


number of variables is shown before and after the clustering procedure to remove redundancy  <cit> , as well as the number of variables annotated with level- <dig> subsystems  <cit> . the full matrix of  <dig>  variables used in the manuscript is provided in additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  see text for details.



we use this wide range of variables to classify the genomes by their niche, in each of the three niche dimensions of space, time, and habitat. we use the rf method, an advanced machine learning approach that uses many decision trees in parallel  <cit> . for space and habitat dimensions, we applied classification of the strains into six continents and two habitats, respectively. for the time dimension, we applied regression of all genotypic variables against the year of origin. all rfs contained  <dig>  decision trees.

in general, all rfs have high prediction accuracies, indicating that the annotated genotypic variables contain enough structure in each of the niche dimensions to allow for classification. the habitat-rfs classified the genomes as clinical or environmental with  <dig> % accuracy. the space-rfs classified the genomes by continent with an average of  <dig> % accuracy, which is high compared to an expected  <dig> % accuracy if the genomes were randomly assigned to one of the six continents. the time-rf explained  <dig> % of variation.

next, the rfs identified which genotypic variables were most important for classification in each of the three niche dimensions explored . to summarize these results, we analyzed how many of the genotypic variables in each of the seed level- <dig> subsystems were present in the top 5% most important variables for each rf. as shown in figure  <dig>  "phages, prophages, transposable elements, and plasmids" was the major functional class structuring the genomes in every niche dimension. of a total of  <dig> genotypic variables with this level- <dig> subsystem annotation,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  were present among the  <dig>   most important variables for space, time, and habitat, respectively. this illustrates the importance of phages and mobile elements for genome evolution, allowing v. cholerae to persist in a large volume of the space defined by these three major niche dimensions.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
here, we investigate how the versatile phenotype of v. cholerae, a bacterium that persists across the three major niche dimensions space, time, and habitat, is reflected in its genome. we take a data-driven approach for comparative functional genomics  <cit>  that includes automated annotation of genotypic variables in  <dig> low-level functional categories  <cit>  and rf machine learning for prioritizing the variables  <cit> . this approach allows us to fully exploit the genotypic information in many complete genomes simultaneously, and identify which genotypic variables structure the strains in niche space. in each of the three niche dimensions, we find that variations in phages, prophages, transposable elements, and plasmids underlie the diversity and explain most of the structure in the data. these results confirm previous investigations of the separate niche dimensions, showing the importance of these mobile functions in shaping the v. cholerae genome. in the spatial dimension, they drive geographic endemism  <cit> ; in time they structure temporal epidemics  <cit> ; and habitat preference is determined by the presence of phage-encoded pathogenicity factors  <cit> .

high-volume genome sequencing is becoming more affordable, and high-throughput pipelines like those employed here are capable of rapidly annotating thousands of genomic elements including snps, protein families, functions, and prophages. exploiting these developments, novel statistical and machine learning analyses can be used to identify connections between genotype and phenotype. whereas here we apply our approach to niche annotations which are widely available for sequenced strains, it can similarly be used for matching any phenotypic measurement to genotypes , and it will only gain in statistical power by including more genomes.
