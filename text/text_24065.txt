BACKGROUND
the innate immune response is the first line of defense against invading pathogens and is required for an efficient adaptive immune response. toll-like receptors  play a crucial role in innate immunity by recognizing specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns including lipoproteins, lipopeptides, lipopolysaccharide, flagellin, dsrna, ssrna and cpg dna motifs . phylogenetic analysis has classified vertebrate tlrs into six major gene families  <cit> : tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  most vertebrates have a single gene for each tlr gene family  <cit> ; the major exception is the tlr <dig> gene family, which appears to have multiple, paralogous genes. in mammals, the tlr <dig> gene family consists of four members: tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  in birds, there are also four paralogues with multiple names in the literature, two tlr1-like genes: tlr1la  and tlr1lb , and two tlr2-like genes: tlr2a  and tlr2b . more distantly related members of the tlr <dig> gene family are tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> found in mammals and birds, respectively. phylogenetic and genome analyses suggest that tlr1- and tlr2-like genes diverged from a common ancestor early in vertebrate evolution  <cit> . the genes of the tlr <dig> gene family are usually in tandem in both avian and mammalian genomes and are likely to be the product of successive rounds of tandem gene duplications from an ancestral gene.

gene duplication followed by sequence divergence is one of the most important mechanisms for generating new genes with novel functions  <cit> . genetic drift and positive selection have both played a role in the fixation and early evolution of duplicated genes  <cit> . many studies have classified genes showing evidence of positive selection  <cit> , where genes with roles in host defense/immunity, chemosensory perception and reproduction are particularly over represented. analysis of the non-synonymous/synonymous substitution ratio revealed the presence of both strictly conserved and rapidly evolving region in the tlr-related genes in primates <cit> . a recent comparative sequence analysis from a panel of domestic chickens and wild jungle fowl suggest that tlrs show positive selection  <cit> . more specifically, an earlier study suggested that the leucine-rich repeats of chicken tlr1la and tlr1lb may have been subject to positive selection. in contrast, the sequences of all other avian tlrs were under purifying selection  <cit> , which appears to be the trend for all tlrs in mammals  <cit> .

in mammals, tlr <dig> dimerizes with either tlr <dig> to recognize microbial triacyl lipoproteins or tlr <dig> to recognize diacyl lipopeptides found in mycoplasma, lipoteichoic acid of gram-positive bacteria or zymosan of yeasts  <cit> . recently, human tlr <dig> has also been shown to dimerize with tlr <dig> and to recognize triacyl lipoproteins  <cit> , although signaling by this complex appears to differ from the other tlr1/6/ <dig> complexes. in chicken  <cit>  expression of tlr1la or b, or tlr2a or b alone fail to be activated by exogenous agonists; however heterodimers of all four tlr1/tlr <dig> combinations were activated by both diacyl  and triacyl  lipopeptides, with the exception of tlr2a/tlr1lb, which was activated by pam <dig> but not malp- <dig>  in addition, tlr2a/tlrl1b was also activated by peptidoglycan. the interaction of these tlr1- and tlr2-like proteins in the absence of any agonist was also shown by immunoprecipitation. thus, chicken tlr1-like proteins interact with tlr2-like proteins and recognize agonists identical to those used in mammals by heterodimers between tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> 

a recent study  <cit>  showed sequence divergence in the c-terminal regions of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> in mammals to be severely limited by gene conversion. this  <dig> amino acid region encodes the lrr16- <dig> motifs, the c-terminal cap motif, the transmembrane domain and most of the intracellular tir domain. the need to co-evolve with binding partners, such as myd <dig> and tirap may explain the selective advantage for gene conversion in the tir domains of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  a recent report also found evidence for gene conversion in the n- and c-terminal regions of the duplicated tlr2a and tlr2b genes found in the genomes of chicken and zebra finch  <cit> . thus, gene conversion may be a general mechanism that limits the divergence of critical regions in these proteins, while allowing other domains, such as the ligand binding domain, to evolve diversified functions.

the aim of this work was to seek possible explanations for the apparent multiple, independent gene duplications proposed to account for the diversity and size of the tlr <dig> gene family  <cit> . from a phylogenetic analysis of many avian and mammalian tlr1-like and tlr2-like genes we have defined the likely role of positive selection, gene duplication, gene conversion and gene co-evolution in the evolutionary dynamics of this family. our phylogenetic and structural analysis of vertebrate tlr <dig> gene family members also predicts amino acid residues likely to be important in the primary function of tlrs in the host's defense against invading pathogens.

methods
nucleic acid extraction
total rna from turkey spleen was extracted by trizol  according to the manufacture's protocol. the sample was re-suspended in a final volume of  <dig> μl of rnase-free water. a routine phenol/chloroform extraction method was used to purify turkey genomic dna. both the quantity and quality of total rna and genomic dna were assessed at od <dig> and od <dig> using a nanodrop nd- <dig> spectrophotometer .

dna cloning and sequencing
bac clones containing tlr1a/tlr1b or tlr2a/tlr2b sequence were screened by 4d, two-step pcr from a hindiii, female beijing duck genomic bac library with inserts from vector pindig- <dig> . the primers used to screen the duck bac library, were designed from the orthologous sequences in other species such as chicken, pig, human or the partial sequence of duck    <cit> . positive clones were confirmed by sequence analysis of pcr products, then subcloned into puc <dig> and sequenced by the shotgun method,  using big dye terminator v <dig>   on an abi3130x sequencer . base calling and quality assessment were performed using phred  <cit> , assembly was performed using phred and consed  <cit> . sequence identity between duck and chicken genomic sequences was analyzed using zpicture  <cit> .

to clone the tlr <dig> gene family sequences from turkey, pcr reactions were carried out in 100ųl total volume, containing  <dig> ng turkey genomic dna,  <dig> mm tris/hcl ,  <dig> mm kcl,  <dig> mm 2so <dig>   <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> mm dntp,  <dig> u faststart taq dna polymerase , and  <dig> pmol each primer designed from the orthologous sequence in chicken and duck . pcr reaction conditions were: denaturing for  <dig> min at 94°c, followed by 94°c for 30s, annealing for 30s, and 72°c for  <dig> min per  <dig> kb,  <dig> cycles, with a final  <dig> min elongation step at 72°c. pcr products were purified from agarose gels with the qiaexii gel extraction kit , ligated into pcr4-topo , transformed into e. coli top <dig> competent cells and plasmid dna was sequenced using t <dig> or t <dig> universal primer. in addition, the sequences at the 3`end of tlr2a and tlr2b were cloned from turkey spleen rna by 3`-race using the firstchoice rlm-race kit  and confirmed against the genomic sequence of turkey.

sequence analysis
sequences from the tlr <dig> gene family were collected from the national center for biotechnology information   using the blast search program  <cit> , retrieved through searches in ensembl  and identified by blat searches on the ucsc genome bioinformatics database . the alignments of amino acid and nucleotide sequence used for the analysis of gene conversion and the construction of phylogenetic trees, and for the calculation of percentage identities were made using clustalx   <cit> . sequence homologies were displayed using jalview  <dig> . <dig> <cit> .

gene conversion analysis
recombination analysis was performed using geneconv  with default settings  <cit> . the more conservative and accurate p-values from permutations  were used and p-values  from global fragments were corrected for multiple comparisons. the aligned sequences were examined for possible gene conversion events using the sliding-window genetic diversity plot   by bootscan with a neighbor-joining  tree, maximum-likelihood distance model, with  <dig>  pseudo-replicates in a  <dig> bp window and with a step size of  <dig> bp  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis
molecular phylogenies based on sequence alignments are only as accurate as the alignment data from which they are produced; consequently it is important that the alignment data quality is determined  <cit> . in order to assess the alignment's tree like structure, likelihood mapping was carried out using tree-puzzle   <cit> , which generally showed alignments to have strong phylogenetic signals with 89-94% of quartets  support a unique phylogeny .

phylogenetic relationships among orthologues and paralogues of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> subfamilies were carried out on the protein alignment using phyml   <cit> . after selection of the best substitution model for the aligned protein or dna sequence by comparing the likelihood values of different models, two rounds of analysis were used to search the maximum-likelihood trees under the jtt model of molecular evolution with  <dig> substitution rates classes for protein sequences or hky <dig> for dna sequences. the phylogenetic tree, the proportion of invariable sites and gamma distribution for protein sequence or transition/transversion ratio for dna sequence parameters were estimated under the above model in the first round. then, the robustness of the inferred tree was assessed using bootstrapping  by fixing the proportion of invariable sites and gamma distribution or transition/transversion parameters in the second round. gene trees were displayed using figtree  .

estimation of the time of gene duplication events
the fossil calibration time of the orthologous tlrs was inferred from species divergence times obtained from the timetree web site . divergence times of gene conversion and duplication were estimated under global and local clock models with two runs using codeml or baseml within the paml package   <cit> . firstly, the "kappa"  and "omega"  for codeml or "alpha"  for baseml were estimated, and then the divergence times were estimated with fixed values for "kappa" and "omega" for codeml or "alpha" for baseml.

maximum likelihood tests of positive selection
multiple sequence alignment of coding sequences were created using dambe  <cit> , first on the translated dna sequences and then the nucleotide sequence of codon triplets was recovered by back translation. dambe was also used to check for saturation of nucleotide substitutions using a plot of the number of transitions and transversions for each pairwise comparison against the genetic distance calculated with the f <dig> model of nucleotide substitution  <cit> , which allows different equilibrium nucleotide frequencies and a transition rate-transversion rate bias. multiple sequence alignments not showing saturation of nucleotide substitutions were then analysed further using codeml <cit> . a series of nested likelihood ratio tests  were performed using codeml to investigate whether some sites were under positive selection in each tlr group. the first test compared m1a  against m2a . the second test compared m <dig>  with m <dig> . the third test was between m8a  and m <dig> 

intra- and intermolecular co-evolution analysis
to identify co-evolutionary patterns, we used the parametric method based on correlated evolutionary patterns among amino-acid sites  <cit>  implemented in caps   <cit> . the probabilities and significance of the correlated evolutionary patterns among amino-acid sites were estimated using a large number  of random samplings and a small α value  to minimize a false-positive rate . caps implements the step-down permutation procedure  <cit>  to correct for multiple testing. the scores for the amino-acid substitutions were obtained using the appropriate blocks substitution matrix   <cit> , depending on the similarity of the protein sequences. possible interactions were also filtered based on cellular compartments: extracellular, transmembrane and cytoplasmic. all amino-acid sites reported in the co-evolutionary analyses refer to the positions in the protein sequences of human tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> 

visualization of co-evolutionary networks
cytoscape   <cit>  was used to visualize the co-evolutionary networks identified by caps, and to generate the networks of correlation between co-evolving amino acids. the correlation coefficients generated in caps were used to determine the color of the lines between nodes .

protein structure analysis
the uniprot protein database  was used as an initial resource to define the protein domain locations of specific amino acid residues in tlr proteins. if there were no annotated protein domains, these were determined by aligning genes with their human orthologues, and then inferring domains from uniprot. to examine potential functional or structural significance of specific amino acid residues, their location was mapped onto the known or predicted three-dimensional structures of tlr proteins. the known structures of human tlr1/2/ <dig>  were used directly and as templates to predict the structures of human tlr <dig> using cphmodels , a protein homology modeling server  <cit> . template recognition was based on profile-profile alignment guided by secondary structure and exposure predictions. the atomic coordinates for the pdb models of human tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> proteins suggested the secondary structure of human tlr <dig> was similar to human tlr <dig> . amino acid residues were mapped onto these structures using the protein blast alignment of each group, and a pymol script file was generated for visualization using pymol  .

RESULTS
isolation of toll-like receptor-like  <dig> and  <dig> genes from the turkey and duck genomes
the coding sequences for chicken and zebra finch members of the tlr <dig> gene family were extracted from sequence databases. the coding sequences for turkey tlr1-like and tlr2-like genes were cloned from genomic dna by pcr using primers based on the chicken orthologues. the 3`-end mrna sequences of turkey tlr2a and tlr2b were cloned by 3`-race with the primers shown in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  duck bac clones containing genes for tlr1a, tlr1b, tlr2a and tlr2b were isolated by four-dimensional, two-step pcr and sequenced . a  <dig>  bp bac clone  contained both tlr1a and tlr1b genes, and a  <dig>  bp bac clone  contained tlr2a and tlr2b . the coding sequences of the tlr <dig> gene family in duck and turkey are encoded by single exons, as found in the chicken. sequence alignment revealed the average percentage identity for pair-wise comparisons between the orthologues in chicken/duck to be  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for nucleotide and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for amino acid sequences, and in chicken/turkey to be  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for nucleotide and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for protein sequences. sequences for the duck and turkey tlr <dig> genes were submitted to genbank .

multiple gene conversion events during the evolution of the tlr <dig> gene family
maximum-likelihood  trees for tlr1-like  and tlr2-like  genes were initially constructed using all available vertebrate coding sequences . however, the results suggested that paralogues were more similar than orthologues. such a result could be explained if one or more gene conversion events between paralogues had occurred during their evolution. to establish whether gene conversion has occurred between paralogues and to identify its boundaries, we analyzed the sequences of three groups using geneconv  <cit>  and simplot  <cit> . group 1: avian tlr1a/tlr1b , group 2: avian tlr2a/tlr2b  and group 3: mammalian tlr1/tlr <dig> . no gene conversion was detected between mammalian tlr1/tlr <dig> or tlr6/tlr <dig> sequences . the results with geneconv  were highly significant  between the paralogues of the same species in groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> providing evidence of gene conversion between ancestral sequences of paralogues. simplot also showed high sequence identity between the paralogues in these groups . to examine whether gene conversion had occurred outside the coding region, we re-examined multiple alignments including 3`-utrs using simplot. the boundaries of gene conversion were the same as those without the 3`-utr except for bos taurus tlr1/ <dig> genes , which extended into the 3'-utr for ~ <dig> bp.

the boundaries of gene converted regions were based on geneconv analysis with mismatches allowed . the avian species are chicken, turkey, duck and zebra finch and the mammalian species are cattle, dog, marmoset, horse, hedgehog, human, rhesus monkey, mouse, orangutan, chimpanzee, rat and pig. the positions of fragments are given with respect to the aligned sequences of avian tlr1a/b, avian tlr2a/b or mammalian tlr1/ <dig>  the gene-converted fragments of the tlr <dig> gene family members are the c-terminal regions of avian tlr1a/b, avian tlr2a/b, mammalian tlr1/ <dig>  and the n-terminal regions of avian tlr2a/b. "bc ka p-values": bonferroni-corrected ka  p values. "number of polymorphisms", "number of differences" and "total differences" represents the number of polymorphic sites within gene-converted fragments of each group, number of mismatched sites between gene-converted paralogous fragments from the same species and total number of mismatched sites between aligned paralogous sequences from the same species, respectively.

we divided the sequences of groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> into regions predicted to have undergone gene conversion or not . amino acid sequences encoded by these regions were used to create separate ml phylogenies using phyml  <cit>  for group  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> genes. a tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> orthologue from zebrafish  was used as an outgroup gene to root these trees. the ml trees of group  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes calculated using the gene conversion free regions  were as expected from the species tree. in contrast, using group  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> sequences in the regions predicted to be susceptible to gene conversion, showed paralogues to be more similar to each other than the corresponding orthologues . for most species, except primates, group  <dig> paralogues were more similar than orthologues and clustered together in tlr1/ <dig> pairs within each species . however, for most primates, except the common marmoset , we find orthologues to be more similar, indicating the last gene conversion event occurred prior to the callithric jacchus/macaca mulatta split,  <dig> million years ago .

the sequence identities in specific regions between orthologues and paralogues are summarized in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  for groups  <dig> and  <dig> sequence identities in the c-terminal regions of paralogues  were significantly greater than the corresponding identities between orthologues . in contrast, sequence identities between the n-terminal regions of paralogues were lower than orthologues . for group  <dig> sequence identities of n- and c-terminal regions of paralogues were higher than orthologues . however, the central region was more conserved between orthologues .

amino acid sequences that remained invariant throughout evolution or became identical through convergent evolution are less likely to be encoded by the same codons than sequences that became identical after gene conversion <cit> . to discriminate between these possibilities as the cause for the greater sequence identity between paralogues, we compared the codon usage of conserved  amino acids in group  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes. overall, paralogues share  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % amino acid identity in groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . analysis of codon usage for conserved amino acids  in groups  <dig> and  <dig> indicated that identical codons were more frequently used in the c-terminal  than in the n-terminal  region. in group  <dig> identical codons in both n- and c-terminal regions were used more frequently  than those in the central region .

taken together these results support a process of gene conversion rather than gene convergence, as the major cause for increased sequence identity between paralogues.

identification of tlr <dig> pseudogenes in mammalian genomes
two functional copies of tlr <dig>  were found in the genomes of chicken, turkey, duck and zebra finch, extending the earlier observations  <cit> . to examine the evolutionary history of the tlr <dig> gene duplication, we searched all available vertebrate genome sequences for possible functional or non-functional sequences. two functional copies of tlr <dig> were also detected in xenopus tropicalis but only one functional gene was identified in  <dig> species of fish and  <dig> species of mammals. previous work  <cit>  detected a tlr <dig> pseudogene  in tandem with the functional copy in the genomes of opossum, dog and human. we have extended this observation to include an additional five mammalian genomes: chimpanzee, orangutan, rhesus monkey, marmoset and horse . the identification of multiple tlr <dig> genes and pseudogenes on many mammals and xenopus tropicalis suggests an early gene duplication event in the history of the tlr <dig> gene family. in most cases, mammalian tlr <dig> functional genes and pseudogenes formed distinct clusters  as expected from the species tree. the exception was the horse, where its functional gene was more similar to its pseudogene, suggesting a recent gene conversion event between these paralogues. this was supported by finding high sequence homology between these paralogues using simplot .

a complex history of gene duplication and gene conversion during the evolution of the vertebrate tlr <dig> gene family
to examine the evolutionary origins of the tlr <dig> gene family we used the regions free of gene conversion defined above  to identify orthologues between avian and mammalian genes. the ml tree based on the region free of gene conversion of the tlr <dig> subfamily is split into two distinct branches . in the first branch, the mammalian tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> genes showed closest similarity with the avian tlr1b genes . for the second branch, the mammalian tlr <dig> gene clustered with the avian tlr1a genes . these conclusions were supported further by finding high sequence identity between 3'-utrs of human tlr1/chicken tlr1b  and 5'-utrs of human tlr10/chicken tlr1a . a ml gene tree based on the central sequence free of gene conversion in the tlr <dig> subfamily showed the lineage for the single mammalian functional tlr <dig> gene to be more closely related to avian tlr2a than tlr2b .

the dates for gene duplication were estimated from an analysis of the sequences free of gene conversion using codeml  <cit>  and summarized in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  either global or local clock models of nucleotide substitution were used and calibrated using dates from the fossil record. for the tlr <dig> subfamily, we estimate an initial gene duplication event  <dig> mya that gave rise to the tlr1a-tlr <dig> and tlr1b-tlr1/ <dig> lineages, which was prior to the common ancestor for birds and mammals 310- <dig> mya. subsequently a further gene duplication 270- <dig> mya gave rise to the tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> genes in mammals. the gene duplication event that gave rise to the tlr <dig> subfamily was estimated to be 341- <dig> mya, which was prior to the common ancestor for birds and mammals 310- <dig> mya. similarly, the dates for gene conversion were inferred from an analysis of sequences predicted to have undergone gene conversion. predicted dates were very variable between all species, varying from 0- <dig> mya and generally older in mammals .

positive selection in the coding regions of the tlr <dig> gene family in birds and mammals
the estimation of substitution saturation from either the tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> subfamilies suggested the number of transitions reached a plateau when d >  <dig>  . beyond this time, positions are saturated for pairs of nucleotide sequences . based on these comparisons we then used site-specific codeml analysis to detect evidence of positive selection on the full length sequences of tlr <dig> gene family orthologues <cit> : four groups of mammals  and four birds .

maximum likelihood estimates of parameters under codon models of variable ω  values across sites in the tlr dataset are listed in table  <dig>  for mammalian tlr <dig> parameter estimates under m2a suggest 2% of sites to be under positive selection with ŵ <dig> =  <dig> . estimates under m <dig> suggest 4% of sites to be under positive selection with ŵs =  <dig> . four sites were inferred to have ω >  <dig> with high posterior probabilities  under m8: residues 174t, 238a, 286q and 599s. similar estimates were found for tlr <dig>  estimates under m2a suggest 2% of sites to be under positive selection with ŵ <dig> =  <dig> . estimates under m <dig> suggest 4% of sites to be under positive selection with ŵs =  <dig> . only, one site was inferred to have ω >  <dig>  under m8: residue 90l and two under m2: 90l, 296d. tlr <dig> estimates under m2a did not suggest any sites to be under positive selection. estimates under m <dig> suggest 2% of sites to be under positive selection with ŵs =  <dig> . no sites were inferred to have ω >  <dig>  under either m2a or m <dig> models. mammalian tlr <dig> estimates under m2a did not suggest any sites to be under positive selection. estimates under m <dig> suggest 2% of sites to be under positive selection with ŵs =  <dig> . two sites were inferred to have ω >  <dig>  under m8: residues 453g and 766m.

1the sequences for this analysis are provided in additional file  <dig>  2the referenced sequences for mammalian and avian genes are human and duck, respectively. amino acid sites inferred to be under positive selection from bayes-empirical-bayes  analysis are shown with log-likelihoods greater than 90% , 95%  or 99% .

avian tlr1a and tlr1b parameter estimates under m2a or m <dig> models did not suggest any sites to be under positive selection. the lack of evidence for positive selection in the avian tlr1a/tlr1b genes may have been due to lack of power with only four sequences to compare, however this was not the case for the four avian tlr2a/tlr2b sequences. tlr2a estimates under m2a suggest 4% of sites to be under positive selection with ŵ <dig> =  <dig> . estimates under m <dig> suggest 9% of sites to be under positive selection with ŵs =  <dig> . three sites were inferred to have ω >  <dig>  under m8: residues 184t, 304n and 506s. tlr2b estimates under m2a suggest 11% of sites to be under positive selection with ŵ <dig> =  <dig> . estimates under m <dig> suggest 14% of sites to be under positive selection with ŵs =  <dig> . three sites were inferred to have ω >  <dig>  under m8: residues 175t, 260v and 496s.

co-evolution of heterodimers between tlr1/6/ <dig> and tlr <dig> in mammals
the caps analysis between  <dig> pairs of mammalian tlr1/ <dig> sequences identified  <dig> groups of co-evolving amino acid residues . within tlr <dig>   <dig> residues were identified as co-evolving with  <dig> in tlr <dig> with correlation coefficients between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . most co-evolving residues were located in the extracellular region  and far fewer  in cytoplasmic regions. similarly, we identified  <dig> groups of co-evolving amino acid residues using  <dig> pairs of tlr6/ <dig> sequences . within tlr <dig>   <dig> amino acid residues were identified as co-evolving with  <dig> amino acid residues within tlr <dig> with correlation coefficients between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . all of the inter-co-evolving sites of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> were distributed in extracellular regions. finally, we identified  <dig> groups of co-evolving amino acid residues using  <dig> pairs of tlr10/ <dig> sequences . within tlr <dig>   <dig> amino acid residues were identified as co-evolving with  <dig> amino acid residues within tlr <dig> with correlation coefficients between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . most co-evolving residues within tlr <dig> were located in the extracellular region . however, inter-co-evolving sites were also detected in transmembrane  and cytoplasmic  regions.

we also looked for evidence of intra-molecular co-evolution using intra-protein caps analysis with the sequences of tlr <dig> family genes. within tlr <dig>   <dig> amino acids from the extracellular region and  <dig> from the cytoplasmic region were identified as co-evolving with correlation coefficients between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . however, there was no evidence of co-evolving amino acids from an analysis of  <dig> mammalian tlr <dig> sequences . within tlr <dig>   <dig> amino acids from the extracellular region and  <dig> from the cytoplasmic region which were identified as co-evolving with correlation coefficients between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . within tlr <dig>   <dig> amino acids from the extracellular region,  <dig> from the transmembrane domain and  <dig> from the cytoplasmic region were identified as co-evolving with correlation coefficients between  <dig>  and  <dig>  .

discussion
tlrs play a crucial role in the host's early defense against invading pathogens  <cit> . in the past few years our understanding of the mechanisms by which tlrs recognize pathogens and induce distinct signaling pathways has increased significantly, particularly in mammals  <cit> . the tertiary structures of various tlrs and ligand complexes have also been determined  <cit> . in contrast, studies on avian tlrs have been very limited <cit> . in this paper, we examined the evolution and selective constraints on members of the tlr <dig> gene family in both birds and mammals. here we discuss the details of these evolutionary origins and the significance of selection constraints on the structure and function of this family of cell surface receptors.

evolutionary origins of the tlr <dig> gene family
previous phylogenetic analyses of the tlr <dig> gene family suggested there had been many independent gene duplications in birds and mammals  <cit> . this contrasts with the tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> families where gene trees generally recapitulate species trees  <cit> . detailed analysis presented in this paper, together with the previous studies by kruithof et al. and cormican et al,  <cit>  suggests gene conversion events between paralogues had occurred during the evolution of the tlr <dig> gene family in both birds and mammals, giving rise to ambiguous orthologous relationships. we show that gene conversion events have occurred independently in most avian and mammalian lineages during the last  <dig> million years. generally gene conversion events have been more recent in birds  than mammals . gene conversion occurred in the mammalian tlr1/tlr <dig> genes 42- <dig> mya in the common ancestor of four primate species  and independently in other mammals. interestingly, gene conversion in the n- and c-terminal regions of avian tlr2a/tlr2b may have occurred independently. for example, in the duck we predict these events to be separated by  <dig> million years. these results suggest that n- and c-terminal regions of avian tlr <dig> genes may be under different selective constraints.

to understand more about the evolutionary origins of the tlr <dig> gene family, we constructed gene trees based on sequences from the tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> subfamilies free from gene conversion. for the tlr <dig> subfamily, two groups of orthologues were defined in birds and mammals as avian tlr1a/mammalian tlr <dig> and avian tlr1b/mammalian tlr1/tlr <dig>  predicted to be the product of a gene duplication event  <dig> mya. subsequently in mammals, a further gene duplication event 270- <dig> mya gave rise to the paralogues tlr1/ <dig>  this orthology between tlr1a/tlr <dig> and tlr1b/tlr1/tlr <dig> was strengthened by finding additional sequence identity in the flanking, non-coding regions of avian and mammalian genes . similarly, phylogenetic analysis strongly indicated that tlr2a to be orthologous to the functional tlr <dig> gene in mammals, sharing a common ancestor with tlr2b 341- <dig> mya, prior to the split of reptiles and mammals 310- <dig> mya. this analysis prompted us to search the genomes of mammals for tlr <dig> paralogues, possibly missed by current annotations. tlr2p was found in tandem with the functional tlr <dig> gene in human, chimpanzee, orangutan, rhesus monkey, marmoset, horse and dog. together with the predicted time of divergence of the tlr2a/b genes , these results supposed that the tlr2b/2p genes were orthologues. in mammals, tlr2p may have recently been functional and independently pseudogenised in each species, possibly due to selection pressure against duplicate tlr <dig> genes. if true, this would suggest that different selective constraints are acting on the duplicate tlr <dig> genes in birds. this would be consistent with the more broad responses found in avian tlr1/ <dig> heterodimers, possibly in response to a more diverse set of pathogens.

functional and structural significance of selection constraints within the tlr <dig> family
gene conversion is a process of non-reciprocal transfer of genetic information between genes. it is favored by high sequence homology, for example between tandem, duplicated genes and leads to their concerted evolution. such a process has already been proposed to take place between the closely related tlr1/ <dig> genes in mammals and the tlr2a/b genes in chicken and zebra finch  <cit> . structural analysis based on the reported crystal structure of the tlr1-subfamily genes in human and mouse  <cit>  suggested that gene conversion regions between the paralogues  were mapped to a single region ranging from lrr <dig> to the tir domain in birds and from lrr <dig> to the tir domain in mammals . for the tlr <dig> subfamily, gene conversion in avian tlr2a/b mapped to two regions; the first stretching from the n-terminus to lrr <dig> and the second from lrr <dig> to the tir domain . these results suggest that gene conversion may have played an important role in maintaining the conservation of the dimerization domain, transmembrane domain and the c-terminal intracellular tir domain in tlr1-gene family. this may have been a selective advantage by maintaining co-evolution with binding partners, such as myd <dig>  trif, tiraf and tram required for intracellular signaling  <cit> . in birds, an additional region of gene conversion was mapped in an n-terminal domain of the tlr <dig> subfamily. the function of this region is unknown and may bind to an uncharacterized binding partner.

many genes of the immune system and those involved in host-pathogen interactions, such as the mhc complex, trim5alpha and havcr <dig>  and show significant evidence of positive selection  <cit> . however, work so far suggests that most amino acid sites in tlrs are subject to purifying selection  <cit> . domain-switching experiments between tlr1/ <dig> showed the lrr9- <dig> modules to play crucial roles in lipopeptide recognition  <cit> . these modules constitute a critical portion of the central domain and form the ligand binding domain in tlr1/6/ <dig>  they also represent the most divergent regions and are likely to be subject to positive selection in response to pathogen infection. in mammals, our analysis detected positively selected  sites in exposed regions in both tlr <dig>  and tlr <dig>  at similar regions  in or near the central domain but not in tlr <dig>  there were other residues inferred to be subject to positive selection, in the extracellular domain of tlr <dig> , tlr <dig>  and tlr <dig> , and in the transmembrane domain of tlr <dig>  and the tir domain of tlr <dig> . changes in these sites may modify the ligand-binding activity of the tlr1/ <dig> and tlr6/ <dig> complexes. these results suggest that in mammals, changes in the ligand-binding activity of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> may be modified through positive selection. in contrast to mammals, ps sites were detected in both avian tlr2a  and tlr2b , which map onto an exposed region  in or near the ligand-binding domain and shows species-specific response to lipopeptides. the other sites are located at homologous positions in tlr2a  and tlr2b  in the extracellular domain at lrr <dig> and lrr <dig>  respectively , also suggesting those regions shared important functions. these results suggest that in birds, changes in the ligand-binding activity of tlr2a/b may be modified through positive selection, which contrasts with mammals where this appears not to be case. also, unlike mammals, we did not find any sites showing high posterior probabilities in either the tlr1a/b molecules. these results could be due to lack of power in the small samples or they may indicate a difference in the selective constraints between tlr <dig> family proteins in birds and mammals.

tlr <dig> initiates a potent immune response by recognizing diacylated and triacylated lipopeptides. its ligand specificity is controlled by whether it heterodimerizes with tlr1/6/ <dig>  <cit> . therefore extensive protein-protein interactions between tlr1/6/ <dig> and tlr <dig> are to be expected, which should be reflected in a network of co-evolving amino acids. intra-molecular caps analysis detected extensive co-evolution between residues within tlr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> consistent with their ability to form homodimers. tlr <dig> does not form homodimers, which was reflected in the lack of evidence for any co-evolution between amino acid residues even with the alignment of sequences from  <dig> species. inter-molecular caps analysis found extensive co-evolution between amino acids in tlr <dig> complexes with tlr1/2/ <dig>  interestingly, amino acid residues from different domains within tlr <dig> were observed as co-evolving with the same residues in tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> or tlr <dig>  suggesting that there is a high codependence of evolution between the functional domains of tlr <dig> 

most residues within tlr <dig> identified as co-evolving with tlr <dig> were located in the extracellular region  and far fewer  between cytoplasmic regions. similar numbers of co-evolving residues were detected throughout the dimerization domains of tlr <dig>  and tlr <dig> . tlr <dig> however, has almost twice the number of co-evolving sites  in the lipid pocket compared to the lipid channel in tlr <dig> , consistent with the predicted interactions based on tertiary structures  <cit> . there are also five other small clusters of co-evolving amino acid residues, the largest involves residues in the lipid channel of tlr <dig> and the dimerization domain of tlr <dig>  suggesting structural/functional co-dependence. in addition, the tir domains of tlr1/tlr <dig> show co-evolution between residue  <dig> in tlr <dig> and residues  <dig> and  <dig> in tlr <dig>  these residues are located between highly conserved regions thought to be important in tir signaling  <cit> .

tlr <dig> has been shown to have a similar ligand specificity and structure to tlr <dig>  but to use a distinct signaling pathway in these and other tlrs  <cit> . like tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> has an extensive network of co-evolving sites with tlr <dig> in the extracellular region  but has some sites in both the transmembrane  and cytoplasmic  regions. computational modeling and mutational analysis of the tlr10/tlr <dig> complex  <cit>  suggested the presence of a tlr <dig> dimer interface and the lipopeptide-binding channel homologous to that found in tlr <dig>  we also find there is a cluster of  <dig> co-evolving sites  involving four residues in ligand binding and two in dimerization domains. interestingly, there were many more co-evolving sites within the tir domain of the tlr10/tlr <dig> complex than found in tlr1/tlr <dig>  both complexes bind myd <dig> but the signaling pathway for tlr <dig> seems to be distinct from other tlrs. the extra constraints detected in the tir domain may represent binding sites for, as yet, uncharacterized proteins.

tlr <dig> recognizes diacylated lipopeptides by the formation of a heterodimer with tlr <dig>  previous analysis suggested that tlr <dig> did not have a lipid-binding channel as found in tlr <dig>  <cit> . this correlates with the lack of co-evolving sites in the homologous region in tlr <dig> but extensive co-evolution within the lipid binding pocket in tlr <dig> . protein-protein interactions are stronger in tlr6/tlr <dig> than tlr1/tlr <dig> where the dimerization interface in tlr6/tlr <dig> is 80% larger than tlr1/tlr <dig>  <cit> . this is consistent with there being more co-evolving sites in tlr <dig>  than tlr <dig> , which has a similar number to that found in tlr <dig> . there are also two other small clusters of co-evolving amino acid residues, the largest also involving residues in the lipid pocket of tlr <dig> and residues  elsewhere in the tlr <dig> protein , which may represent other sites of functional and/or structural significance, but this awaits further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
the tlr <dig> gene family was previously thought to have arisen by a series of independent gene duplications in multiple vertebrates. however, we show here that the true history of gene duplication events has been masked by gene conversion between paralogous genes. our detailed phylogenetic analysis not only clarifies the gene gains and losses within the tlr <dig> families of birds and mammals, but also defines orthologues between these vertebrates. tlr <dig> and  <dig> in mammals are the orthologues of avian tlr1b, and tlr <dig> in mammals is the orthologue of tlr1a. the functional tlr <dig> gene in mammals is the orthologue of the avian tlr2a genes. the mammalian orthologue of avian tlr2b has been lost in most mammals, with pseudogene fragments  present in a few species. in mammals, we predict amino acid sites under positive selection in tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> but not tlr <dig> and detect co-evolution of amino acid residues between tlr1/tlr <dig> proteins that may be required to maintain their ability to form functional tlr1/ <dig> complexes. in birds, we were able to predict positive selection in the tlr2a/b genes at functionally significant amino acid residues but not in tlr1a/b. in both birds and mammals these amino acid residues include known structural and functional sites, involved in ligand binding and dimerization. this analysis also predicts many other sites of functional and/or structural significance, but further investigations are required to define these roles. this analysis also suggests divergence in the function of avian and mammalian tlr <dig> gene family proteins, each under different selective constraints. in mammals, it appears that tlr <dig> and  <dig> are subject to positive selection more significant than tlr <dig>  where in birds the reverse seems to be the case for tlr2-like genes. in contrast, the tlr10/tlr <dig> complex does not appear to be subject to positive selection. our phylogenetic and structural analyses of vertebrate tlr <dig> family members has clarified their evolutionary history and predicts amino acid residues likely to be important in their primary function in the host's defense against invading pathogens.
