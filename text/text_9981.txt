BACKGROUND
grapes are among the most valuable fruit crops, grown on about  <dig> million ha with an annual production of approximately  <dig> million tonnes worldwide  <cit> . there are over  <dig> species of vitis around the world  <cit>  and vitis vinifera is the most widely planted grapevine. however, most cultivars of v. vinifera are highly susceptible to various economically important diseases such as powdery mildew   <cit> , downy mildew   <cit>  and anthracnose  <cit> . enhancing resistance to these diseases is the focus area in current grape breeding programs. wild species may possess valuable genetic variations  in disease resistance genes, particularly, in nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat  proteins. it has been reported that the species-specific genes in wild and semi-wild watermelon were highly enriched with genes involved in disease-related processes  <cit> . in addition, the wild eggplant carries nearly  <dig> extra disease resistant genes compared to the cultivated eggplant  <cit> . grape, unlike other domesticated crops, has retained high genetic diversity from wide progenitors  <cit> ; however, most european cultivars are susceptible to many fungal diseases. moreover, only limited disease resistant loci, such as run <dig>  <cit> , ren <dig>  <cit> , ren <dig>  <cit>  and ren <dig>  <cit>  that confer resistance to pm, and rpv loci including rpv <dig>  <cit> , rpv <dig>  <cit>  and rpv <dig>  <cit>  that confer resistance to dm, have been identified, mainly from wild grapevine species. currently, the widely planted grape cultivars are very sensitive to diverse pathogens. thus, genetic engineering of disease resistance in grape has become an increasing need and this can be facilitated by the use of wild vitis resources.

china, as one of the major centers of the origin of vitis, has more than  <dig> native vitis species  <cit> . chinese wild vitis are naturally distributed throughout the country and many of them can survive in regions of high humidity and moisture  <cit> , under which the occurrence of fungal diseases is increased  <cit> . a number of disease resistant chinese wild vitis have been identified and characterized. the pioneering work from wang et al.  <cit>  and wan et al.  <cit>  identified a large number of chinese wild grapes that displayed strong resistance to pm. wan et al.  <cit>  also found about half of the chinese wild vitis were resistant to dm and around one third of them have both pm and dm resistances. in addition, wang et al.  <cit>  and li et al.  <cit>  found that all the investigated chinese wild vitis exhibited much less susceptibility to anthracnose compared to the two v. vinifera cultivars . moreover, chinese wild vitis showed other specific characteristics, such as high photosynthetic efficiency in v. quiqangualaris rehd  <cit>  and high content of resveratrol  in v. quiqangualaris danfeng- <dig>  <cit> . however, the underlying genetic variations contributing to these phenotypic differences have not yet been explored.

grapevine is the first fruit crop that had its genome sequenced. the high quality genome has been served as the reference for many genetic studies. however, recent deep sequencing experiments have shown that relying on a single reference genome may underestimate the variability among different genotypes  <cit> . for example, reconstructing the transcriptomes of different grape genotypes has revealed substantial heterogeneity in transcripts that associated with their phenotypes  <cit> . in this study, we aim to characterize chinese wild vitis transcriptomes to explore the potential genetic diversities such as snps and indels. to this end, two chinese wild v. pseudoreticulata accessions “baihe-13-1”  and “hunan-1” , and one v. quinquangularis accession “shang-24”  were selected for deep transcriptome sequencing. the selected accessions possess valuable resistances to various fungal pathogens including pm   <cit> , dm   <cit>  and anthracnose   <cit> . we de novo assembled the transcriptomes and conducted comparative analysis of snps and small indels between wild accessions and the reference genome, pn <dig>  distinct genes, which represent genes that are absent or highly divergent from sequences in the reference pn <dig> genome, were then identified from each accession. using transcript information from strand-specific rna-seq libraries, we have identified cis-natural antisense transcript  pairs, which were known to participate in a broad range of regulatory events.

RESULTS
transcriptome sequencing, de novo assembly, and comparison with the reference genome
in order to more broadly capture disease related genes, we infected young leaves of the three chinese wild grapes with pm. based on the proposed pm infection cycle  <cit> , as well as our previous studies  <cit> , we collected leaves at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 120 hours post inoculation . we then prepared eight independent strand-specific rna-seq libraries for each accession. in total,  <dig> libraries were constructed and sequenced on the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform. after removing adaptors, low quality sequences, and ribosomal rna  reads , we obtained a total of  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> high quality cleaned reads for bh, hn and s, respectively . the transcriptomes of the three wild chinese vitis were constructed de novo separately. the final assembled transcript sets of bh, hn and s contained  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs, respectively, with n <dig> lengths of 814 bp, 876 bp and 980 bp and average lengths of 602 bp, 630 bp and 679 bp . the gc-contents of these three transcript sets were similar , but slightly higher than that of the pn <dig> transcripts . the assembled transcriptome sequences of the three chinese wild vitis can be downloaded and blasted at http://bioinfo.bti.cornell.edu/wild_vitis.table  <dig>

to discover the variations between chinese wild vitis and pn <dig>  a genotype derived from pinot noir, all three transcriptomes were aligned to the pn <dig> genome. there were 94% , 94%  and 93%  of the total transcripts can be uniquely aligned to the reference genome with ≥ 97% sequence identity for bh, hn and s, respectively . only 1% of them were mapped to multiple locations of the pn <dig> genome and most of them were mapped to two locations. the majority of transcripts  were mapped to the annotated gene regions  with overlap fraction ≥ 90% and had the same strand with the corresponding pn <dig> transcripts; whereas around 2% of the transcripts were aligned to gene regions in antisense orientations. notably, a small proportion  of the transcripts were aligned entirely to the intergenic regions. among all the assembled transcripts,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   could not be aligned to the pn <dig> genome. we considered these transcripts as candidates for distinct genes.figure  <dig>

functional annotation of wild chinese vitis transcripts
all the transcripts from the three chinese wild vitis were annotated by comparing their sequences against the trembl and swiss-prot protein databases  <cit> . in all three genotypes, around  <dig> % of the transcripts had hits in trembl, and around  <dig> % had hits in swiss-prot . the high percentage of transcripts that hit to known proteins, combined with the high mapping rate to the reference genome, indicated the high quality of the de novo assembled transcripts.table  <dig>

the transcripts were further annotated by assigning them human-readable functional terms extracted from the functional descriptions of their homologous proteins using ahrd  <cit> . approximately 80-81% of the transcripts from the three species could be assigned with functional terms. the gene ontology  terms for each transcript were then extracted according to the annotations in swiss-prot and trembl . in total, about 77% transcripts from each accession could be assigned with go terms from at least one of the three go categories, biological process, cellular component and molecular function. the top five subcategories in biological process were “cellular process”, “biosynthetic process”, “response to stress”, “cellular component organization” and “nucleobase-containing compound metabolic process” . pathway analysis  <cit>  revealed approximately  <dig>  genes from each accession that involved in 505– <dig> biochemical pathways.

distinct genes identified in the three wild chinese vitis
the assembled transcripts included redundant sequences, mainly due to alternative splicing. we found that  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  transcripts could be clustered with other transcripts . only one representative transcript from each cluster was used in the downstream functional enrichment/annotation analysis, to avoid the repetitive counting of the same genes. finally, we obtained a total of  <dig> - <dig>  distinct unique transcripts in each of the three accessions. the coding potential of these transcripts was then assessed by coding potential calculator   <cit> . consequently, we got  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  distinct genes with high coding potential from bh, hn and s, respectively, as well as  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> potential non-coding transcripts . the list of these transcripts is provided in additional file  <dig>  we then performed the go term enrichment analyses  on these three distinct protein-coding gene datasets. a total of  <dig> go terms under the category of biological process were enriched in distinct genes in all three accessions , and the most representative go term was response to stimulus , which included nearly half of the distinct genes. among the child terms of go: <dig>  the most significantly enriched one was defense response . we also identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> enriched child go terms associated with resistance-related biological processes in bh, hn and s, respectively .figure  <dig>

plants produce three main secondary metabolites, terpenes, phenolics and nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds, which provide a major barrier against the attack of pathogens and herbivores  <cit> . here, we found that several biological processes related to biosynthesis of phenolic compounds such as coumarin, were enriched in the distinct genes in all three accessions . biosynthesis of flavonoids, a class of phenolic compounds, were enriched in distinct genes of both bh and s. it is worth noting that callose deposition in cell wall and cell wall thickening biological processes and two other processes involved in the metabolism of anthocyanin-containing compounds were enriched in the distinct genes of the s accession. in addition, terpenoid compound metabolism and glucosinolate metabolic related processes were only enriched in the hn distinct genes .

we found an important category of enriched biological processes that were related to the metabolism and action of plant hormones, a group of small molecules which function as versatile regulators of plant growth, development, reproduction and response to abiotic or biotic stresses  <cit> . specifically, jasmonic acid related processes were enriched in distinct genes of bh and s, whereas ethylene biosynthetic and metabolic processes were overrepresented in distinct genes of both hn and s. moreover, abscisic acid related process was only enriched in hn while processes related to salicylic acid and brassinosteroid were enriched in s distinct genes .

we identified  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  distinct genes that were predicted to encode disease-related proteins . interestingly, a large number of them were nbs-lrr genes , which play important roles in plant effector-triggered immunity  as they can directly or indirectly detect pathogen-associated proteins  <cit> . in addition, a large number of genes contained known protein domains related to disease resistance, such as nb-arc  <cit> , lrr, tir and dirigent  <cit> . another group of distinct disease-related genes were those encoding receptor like protein kinases  . in addition to the genes described above, we discovered several genes that are involved in plant-pathogen interaction, such as mlo, phytoalexin-deficient  <dig> , enhanced disease susceptibility  <dig> , rpw <dig>  and genes encoding lipoxygenases  <cit> .

transcription factors play a central role in mediating biological activity in plant cells. we discovered  <dig> transcription factors in each of the three vitis genotypes. more than 70% of these transcription factors belonged to the ethylene-responsive factor family, which has been reported to be involved in the control of primary and secondary metabolism, growth and developmental programs, as well as responses to environmental stresses  <cit> .

snps and small indels between wild chinese vitis and pn40024
genomic variations, such as snps and small insertions and deletions  are important driving force of genetic diversity. we identified snps and small indels through mapping the rna-seq reads from each accession to the reference pn <dig> genome. we obtained a total of  <dig>  snps and  <dig>  small indels between bh and pn <dig>   <dig>  snps and  <dig>  small indels between hn and pn <dig>  and  <dig>  snps and  <dig>  small indels between s and pn <dig>  among these variations, 52% , 48%  and 49%  of snps, and  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of small indels were located in the annotated coding regions . in bh, we identified ~ <dig>  nonsynonymous substitutions, which potentially affect approximately  <dig>  genes. in the other two accessions, we detected more than  <dig>  nonsynonymous mutations that may alter the function of ~ <dig>  genes. the overall ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous sites was ~ <dig>  in all three accessions. interestingly, this ratio in nbs-lrr genes was substantially higher . snps located at specific regions might have large effects on corresponding genes, such as gain or loss of start/stop codons, and disruption of splice site acceptors or donors  <cit> . we found  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes in bh, hn and s, respectively, contained loss of start codon snps which would change the length of protein products . about  <dig> genes with loss of stop codons and  <dig> genes with gain of stop codons were identified in each accession. moreover, small indels mapped to coding regions  led to the frame shifts of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes in bh, hn and s, respectively . the identified snps and small indels were listed in additional file  <dig> figure  <dig>

cis-nats in wild chinese vitis
natural antisense transcripts  are endogenous rna sequences partially or entirely complemented to other transcripts and cis-nat pairs are two transcripts from the same genomic locus but on opposite strands  <cit> . we explored cis-nats in our strand specific rna-seq data and identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cis-nat pairs in bh, hn and s, respectively . the classification of cis-nat pairs based on their overlapping patterns was shown in table  <dig>  in addition,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  cis-nat pairs were designated as coding-noncoding pairs depending on their coding potential calculated by cpc, while  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were classified as coding-coding pairs. cis-nats were previously reported to be involved in modulating various abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> . through functional analysis of the cis-nat pairs we identified in the three chinese wild grapes, we also found those related to abiotic stress responses were significantly enriched. in addition, cis-nats involved in secondary metabolite biosynthetic processes were highly enriched; specifically, among the top five enriched biological processes, four , three  and two  enriched biological processes in bh, hn and s, respectively, were associated with flavonoid metabolic processes .table  <dig>

discussion
in this study, we de novo assembled transcriptomes of three wild chinese vitis accessions. distinct genes and genomic variations between chinese vitis and the reference pn <dig> were extensively investigated. we identified a total of more than  <dig>  distinct protein-coding genes, as well as 600– <dig> non-coding transcripts from each of the three chinese wild vitis. almost half of the distinct protein-coding genes were functionally related to stimulus responses, and ~30% were involved in defense responses. the enrichment of stress-related processes in distinct genes is consistent with the hypotheses that wild plants, which are often exposed to an adverse environment, such as extreme temperatures, aberrant ph, toxic chemicals and pathogens, tend to have accelerated adaptive evolution of stress genes  <cit> , while during domestication, a large number of stress and defense-related genes are lost in the cultivated species, which might be due to the many years of cultivation and selection that have focused on desirable fruit qualities at the expense of disease resistance  <cit> .

genomic variations, such as snps and indels, are important sources of genetic diversity. they are functionally significant and can cause phenotypic changes. genetic analysis of plant disease resistance has shown that resistance is dominated by multiple loci and alleles at each locus are often highly polymorphic  <cit> . in the present study, we obtained  <dig> - <dig>  homozygous snps and ~ <dig>  small indels between each of the three wild chinese vitis and v. vinifera, genotype pn <dig>  this number is distinguished from a previous report on the identification of many fewer snps  between v. vinifera cv. corvina and pn <dig> transcriptomes  <cit> , probably due to both species belong to v. vinifera.

cis-nats are derived from the same genomic loci as their sense counterparts, but from the opposite strand. cis-nat pairs can be classified into three groups based on their overlapping patterns, including 3’ end overlap, 5’ end overlap and one entirely contained within the other  <cit> . in our study, across all three vitis spp., the majority of cis-nat pairs were those entirely contained within the other transcripts. this is consistent with the finding in soybean  <cit>  but different from that in arabidopsis  <cit> , where most cis-nat pairs have 3’ end overlap. cis-nats were reported to participate in plant responses to a wide range of abiotic stresses, such as cold  <cit>  and salt  <cit>  stresses. consistent with these findings, we found that cis-nats identified from wild chinese grapes were significantly enriched with transcripts related to stress responses. in addition, we also observed high enrichment of secondary metabolism-related genes in the wild grape cis-nats, implying the functional diversity of cis-nats in mediating important biological processes in plants.

in the present study, we found 6-10% distinct genes were surface-localized receptor like kinases . some rlks, as well as receptor like proteins , are pattern-recognition receptors   <cit> . they contain various ligand-binding ectodomains that can perceive pathogen-associated molecular patterns , e.g. flagellin, peptidoglycans  and chitins, or damage-associated molecular patterns . rlks  or rlps  can function independently or cohesively  <cit> . in this study, we discovered five distinct genes  containing the lysm motif, a common unit in both rlks and rlps that are responsible for binding to various types of pgns and chitins. unlike typical prrs, pep <dig> receptor  acts as a receptor for pep defense peptides and senses an endogenous elicitor that potentiates pamp-inducible plant responses  <cit> . one pepr <dig> was found in hn distinct genes. pepr <dig> and its closest homolog pepr <dig> can interact with bak <dig>  <cit> , which is a co-receptor for several pamps and regulates their function  <cit> . in addition, other rlks that do not belong to prrs, such as wall-associated kinase  also play important roles in plant immunity signaling pathway. in this study, we found 7– <dig> wak family members in each distinct gene set. waks have an extracellular domain and they can interact with pectin and other proteins located in the cell wall. induction of wak <dig> is required for plants to survive during p. syringae infection. furthermore, the increase of wak <dig> mrna levels is part of the defense response caused by exposure to jasmonic acid , ethylene, or fungi  <cit> . a previous study has unraveled adaptive evolution of extracellular domains of rlks  <cit> , which may explain why many rlks and rlps were observed in distinct genes. the discovery of these genes may also imply the functional conservation in response to pathogen invasion.

pathogens can overcome pamp-triggered immunity  by deploying effectors to interfere with the pti activated signaling pathways. these effectors can be perceived by plant r genes  and activate plant immune system, also known as effector-triggered immunity. these pathogens are usually highly specialized for specific host plants, and the interaction at the molecular level is often complicated because of the co-evolution of the host and pathogens  <cit> . wild and domesticated plant species have been exposed to the natural selection forces, and show divergent r genes as they have to initiate an arms race with the pathogen effector. however, compared to clonally propagated grape cultivars, wild vitis may have evolved new disease resistance genes during sexual propagation. several studies have demonstrated that in plant r-gene products, lrr domains are the major determinants of recognition specificity for effectors  <cit>  and these domains were under diversifying selection to increase amino acid variability. mechanisms for the evolution of new specificities are flexible, such as gene conversion and unequal recombination, as well as accumulation of amino acid codon exchanges in members of anciently duplicated gene families  <cit> . in our distinct genes, ~8% were nbs-lrr genes. notably, from our snp analysis, we found an r gene, gsvivt <dig>  which has longer protein product in the three wild vitis compared with that in pn <dig> caused by a snp in its stop codon. the longer r gene might confer increased specificity for pathogen recognition in the three chinese wild vitis species. interestingly, in a wild potato, a homolog of the vitis longer r gene has been identified, which is heterozygous  and confers broad spectrum resistance to late blight  <cit> .

in this study, a number of flavonoid and isoprenoid biosynthesis genes were identified in the distinct gene sets. flavonoid and isoprenoid biosynthesis was found to be up-regulated in both v. vinifera and v. pseudoreticulata that were inoculated with powdery mildew  <cit> . we also found cis-nats were enriched with flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes in all three wild grapes, which may suggest that flavonoid metabolism is regulated by cis-nats. in our distinct gene sets, several genes related to coumarin biosynthesis and metabolism were discovered. coumarin, a known phytoalexin, was found to accumulate in parsley cells treated with a fungal glucan elicitor  <cit> . several other phytoalexin-related genes were also found in our distinct gene sets, including stilbene synthase  which is a key gene in the biosynthesis of stilbenes, and phytoalexin-deficient  <dig> , a well-known resistance gene in arabidopsis. a recent study showed that arabidopsis transformed with vitis enhanced disease susceptibility  <dig>  and pad <dig> did not display rescued resistance to powdery mildew, even though these two proteins interacted when transiently expressed in nicotiana benthamiana. therefore, involvement of additional interacting proteins might be necessary for resistance to occur  <cit> .

transcriptional regulation of stress responsive genes plays a central role in abiotic/biotic stress responses. erf, a subfamily of ap <dig> transcription factor, has been reported to be involved in many stress responses  <cit> . pti <dig>  an erf in tomato, can be phosphorylated by a disease resistance protein  and regulate gcc-box pr genes  <cit> . mcgrath et al.  <cit>  found that ap2/erf genes were the predominant transcription factor family genes responsive to both ja and a fungal pathogen alternaria brassicicola in arabidopsis. specifically, aterf <dig> acted as a positive regulator of ja-responsive defense gene expression and resistance to a. brassicico while aterf <dig> showed the opposite functions. their results suggest that plants coordinately express multiple repressor- and activator-type ap2/erfs during pathogen challenge to modulate defense gene expression and disease resistance  <cit> . interestingly, in our distinct gene sets from each of three wild species, 70% of the transcription factors belonged to the ap2/erf family, which suggest that in chinese wild vitis the distinct ap2/erf genes might co-evolve with r genes and have a high degree of sequence variations.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study we de novo constructed transcriptomes of three chinese wild grapes, which showed resistances to various fungal pathogens. a comprehensive comparison between these transcriptomes and the reference grape genome unraveled a large number of distinct genes and a rich resource of genetic variations such as snps and small indels. interestingly, many genetic divergences between wild and cultivated grapes were found to be highly related to many important biological processes, particularly defense associated processes, suggesting that the accelerated evolution of these genes may contribute to plant adaptation to different environments. furthermore, the significant enrichment of cis-nat pairs related to secondary metabolism and abiotic stress responses may shed lights on the potential regulatory roles of cis-nats in chinese wild vitis.
