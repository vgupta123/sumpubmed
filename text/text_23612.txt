BACKGROUND
segmental duplications  or low copy repeats , defined as continuous non-repetitive dna sequences that are found at two or more genomic locations, comprise ~5% of the human genome  <cit> . sds can mediate meiotic unequal non-allelic homologous recombination  events, resulting in genomic rearrangement and sometimes altered gene dosage within the intervening regions such as those on 22q <dig> . segmental duplications or low copy repeats on 22q <dig>    <cit>  are of great interest because they have been associated with four different human disorders  <cit> : velo-cardio-facial/digeorge syndrome  , the reciprocal duplication syndrome  <cit> , der syndrome  <cit> , and cat-eye syndrome  <cit> . despite extensive molecular studies in the past decade, the precise position of the breakpoints within the two lcr22s associated with most of these syndromes, lcr22- <dig> and - <dig>  remain largely elusive. this is due to their high sequence similarity  and that there are eight related lcr <dig> blocks on 22q <dig> , comprising over 11% of the region, making it difficult to identify paralogous sequences unique to one or the others  <cit> . interestingly, characterization of the genomic sequence within and near lcr22s demonstrated that both alu repeat elements and at-rich repeats were enriched and likely involved in many of the past unequal crossover duplications that have shuffled dnas among blocks and given rise to the current complex genomic architecture of lcr22s  <cit> . this is consistent with findings from genome-wide analyses of human sds  <cit> .

to understand the duplication architecture of lcr <dig> and more importantly to gain insight to the molecular mechanism behind high incidence of pathogenic lcr <dig> rearrangements causing human congenital malformation syndromes, we have applied a-bruijn graph algorithm to decompose the lcr <dig> architecture to fundamental duplication subunits at nucleotide-level resolution, without any bias to either genes or pseudogenes as was in the case of previous studies focused on lcr22s that are mentioned above . our study moreover found unexpectedly high genetic variation between and within sds, indicating them as highly dynamic in the genome. this is supported by the fact that many subunit copies emerged recently, at either the human or the african great ape lineage, through both small and large-scale duplications. highly active subunits were found with significant enrichment of aluy, a young short interspersed nuclear element , at their ends or short adjacent sequences. this repeat and some subunits associated with it, continue to actively mediate cnv generation in human lcr <dig> region. these cnvs could alter risk to genomic disorders on 22q <dig>  by making them better or worse substrates for meiotic recombination.

RESULTS
segmental duplications on 22q <dig>  and their gene content
segmental duplications  or low copy repeats directly contribute to the genome dynamics and meiotic instability of human 22q <dig> . in this study, we began by surveying the content and extent of duplications within the 22q <dig>  region using sds with sequence identity ≥ 90% and length ≥  <dig> kb that have been annotated by dr. eichler's group through whole genome assembly comparison  and whole genome shotgun sequences detection   <cit> . in total,  <dig> pairs of sd sequences  were located on 22q <dig>  , accounting for ~ <dig>  mb  of its bases. the rest of the dna sequence between sds was referred here as "unique sequences" . the sequence divergence of the sds on 22q <dig>  was relatively low, with a median of  <dig> %, and with 58% of them diverging < 4% . by comparison, the average sequence divergence for all human sds was 6% while 25% of them diverged < 4%. the average length of sds in 22q <dig>  was  <dig> kb , while a significant negative correlation between length and divergence was observed for these sds , suggesting that either many old duplicated sequences have experienced significant nucleotide loss after their emergence or recent duplication events produced mainly large sds.

it is well known that dna duplications can lead to new copies of genes or create pseudogenes  <cit> ; and both genes  <cit>  and pseudogenes  <cit>  are enriched within sds. using the most recent and comprehensive data from the encode gene annotation group  <cit> , we have surveyed the pseudogene and gene content on 22q <dig>  . overall, the sd regions of 22q <dig>  were enriched with about three times more pseudogenes than non-sd regions, as 6% and 2% of the base pairs in the two regions were annotated as pseudogenic, respectively . the percentages of base pairs corresponding to coding exons, however, were more similar . these numbers are higher than average for the human genome, which reflect the known enrichment of genes in 22q <dig> .

decomposition of 22q <dig>  sds to duplication subunits and blocks
to establish a reference frame for studying intra-lcr <dig> duplication activity and to gain insight to their disease susceptibility, we decided to decompose sds to basic duplication subunits, which represent the smallest continuous sequences that have been involved in at least one independent intra-lcr <dig> duplication event. as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the boundaries of subunits denote potential breakpoints, although some of which may be implicated in more duplications than others. indeed, those recurrent subunits  constitute core duplicons that have given rise to the majority of human sds  <cit> . applying the program, repeatgluer that utilized a-bruijn graphs to resolve mosaic structures of repeat sequences  <cit> , we have decomposed the  <dig> pairs of sds in 22q <dig>  to  <dig> non-overlapping subunits . these subunits ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig>  kb, with a mean length of  <dig>  bp . previously, jiang et al have applied the a-bruijn graph algorithm to decompose the human sds to subunits  <cit>  and the resulting subunits were defined very similar to current ones . with previous definition of blocks as guidance  <cit> , we further partitioned the  <dig> subunits into eight duplication blocks, lcr22-2', lcr22-3a', lcr22-3b', and lcr22-4' to lcr22-8' . in comparison with the past definition, currently defined blocks were typically longer and encompassed more sds. our current analysis has particularly expanded the duplicated content of lcr22-4' and lcr22-7' with newly described sds . as shown with paralogous relationship  in figure  <dig>  the newly incorporated sd subunits are surely components of the evolutionary products of the past dna duplications in 22q <dig> , and thus should be added to the "classic" definition of lcr22s and included for future study. additionally, the delineation of sds to individual subunits shows the mosaic evolutionary relationship within lcr22s much more clearly.

as shown in figure  <dig>  the eight lcr22' blocks are separated and flanked by unique  sequences. the clustering of subunits in these blocks suggests that some sequence features may have rendered them as targets of duplication "hotspots". the shared similarity at macro-scale in their subunit arrangements among lcr22-2', lcr22-3a' and lcr22-4' confirms that these three blocks may arise from few instances of large-scale duplication events involving many adjacent subunits simultaneously  <cit> . note that part of lcr22-3a' remains a missing gap in the reference human genome sequence. in contrast, lcr22-3b', lcr22-5', lcr22-6', lcr22-7', and lcr22-8' display a different architectural pattern consisting mostly of small subunits connected in a discrete manner. for example, the average size of subunits in lcr22-4' is  <dig>  bp, which is approximately twice as large as that of lcr22-5'  and four times larger than that of lcr22-7' . analysis of the relative abundance of large subunits, defined by either > <dig> kb, > <dig> kb or > <dig> kb , also showed that large subunits were predominantly located in lcr22-2', lcr22-3a' and lcr22-4'. since large sds overall show low sequence divergence as described above , this result further suggests that the bulk dnas constituting these three blocks was likely generated more recently during evolution than other lcr <dig> blocks. the sporadic presence of a few small subunits specifically in each of the three "young" blocks indicates that new micro-scale duplications have occurred after their initial formation.

occurrence of lcr22s in other primate genomes
as mentioned above, the majority of sds on 22q <dig>  shows < 4% sequence divergence. accordingly, we estimated that the majority  of duplicated sequences emerged between 10- <dig> million years ago and after the divergence of human and macaque lineages, based on an estimation of 3% divergence between duplicated sequences per  <dig> million years  <cit> . to further explore the evolutionary history of these sds, we have surveyed and characterized the syntenic regions of human lcr22' sequences in the chimpanzee, orangutan, and macaque genomes.

using multiple genome alignment data from the ensembl database  <cit>  and with extra filtering to improve syntenic map for duplicated sequences , we found that 70%, 61%, and 26% of the 22q <dig>  sd subunits had unambiguous syntenic sequences in chimpanzee, orangutan, and macaque , respectively, and all together 81% of subunits had syntenic sequences detected in at least one of the three current assembles of non-human primate genomes . more specifically, 39%, 21%, and 26% of duplicated subunits in lcr22-3a', lcr22-2', and lcr22-4', respectively, appeared specific to the human genome . by comparison, only 3% to 19% of the subunits in lcr22-3b', lcr22-5', 6', 7', and 8' exhibited human specificity. we have also carried out a pcr assay to support our syntenic analysis . together with the results from our analysis of subunit distribution in 22q <dig>  , our cross-species syntenic analysis demonstrates that most sequences in lcr22-2', lcr22-3a', and lcr22-4' were generated from more recent duplication events.

this is also supported firstly by fish mapping experiments using probes to four well-characterized genes in the lcr <dig> region that detected signals for the presence of lcr22- <dig>  lcr22- <dig>  lcr22- <dig> sequences in chimpanzee, orangutan and macaque  <cit> . secondly, phylogenetic analysis of bcr, ggt, ggtla and usp <dig> genes or pseudogenes in human lcr22s also indicated lcr22- <dig>  lcr22-3a and lcr22- <dig> were evolutionarily close but they were distant from the other lcr <dig> blocks  <cit> . thirdly, previous comparative analysis of sds in four primate genomes indicated in particular that those located in the distal halves of lcr22- <dig> and lcr22- <dig>  were generated more recently . this important finding is probably relevant to the fact that most of the genomic disorders on 22q <dig>  are mapped to lcr22- <dig>  lcr22-3a and lcr22- <dig> regions, although ascertainment due to deletion of critical dosage sensitive genes associated with known syndromes provides significant bias.

re-construction of large duplication events
one of the main goals of our study is to identify and characterize subunits that are implicated in frequent duplications, as such subunits may host recombination "hotspots" of genomic disorders in 22q <dig> . we started by grouping subunits into paralogous families  to capture their putative intra-lcr <dig> duplication relationships. a total of  <dig> subunit families were assembled from the  <dig> subunits . the sizes of these families range from  <dig> to  <dig> subunits, with one third of these families having fewer than six members.

as shown with cartoons in figure  <dig>  both sd duplicons and subunits need to be appropriately merged and aligned in order to identify past duplication events from multiple candidates correctly. as such, we first merged physically overlapping sd duplicons to obtain duplication loci . we determined a total of  <dig> duplication loci from the 22q <dig>  sds, and they were further separated to  <dig> groups based on sharing of paralogous subunits . finally, aligning all duplication loci to the largest locus of their respective group, as illustrated in figure 1d, yielded a hierarchical structure representing putative duplication relationship of all sds in 22q <dig>  . at the top first level,  <dig> distinct duplication loci were identified  and they accounted for 47% of all sd sequences in 22q <dig> , suggesting that the remaining 53% sd sequences might have arisen from these  <dig> loci.

one feature emerging from the data in figure 2b is that some subunit families are frequently located at the ends  of putative duplications, suggesting that they might have been highly active in mediating past duplication events. for example, at least six duplication events might have been mediated by subunits in the family that included a member at the 5' end of lcr22-2' . somewhat surprisingly, analysis of such subunit families significantly enriched at the boundaries of duplications  revealed that 46% of the subunits implicated in frequent past duplication events harbored or were adjacent to alu elements.

as shown in figure 2b, most of the putative duplications in 22q <dig>  involved relatively small  duplicons and thus were not further pursued due to the limitation of our approach in resolving the donor and acceptor of a duplication event, but at least three duplication events operated on large duplicons . the largest one  occurred between lcr22-2' and lcr22-4' . the other two large-scale duplications involved the largest subunit ; one occurred between lcr22-3a' and lcr22-4', and the other at the distal half of lcr22-4' .

further syntenic analysis  showed that the duplication between lcr22-3a' and lcr22-4' occurred after the split of the macaque lineage, while the duplication at lcr22-4' might have occurred earlier , although a previous complementary analysis comparing sds in four primate genomes  <cit>  indicated that both duplications occurred in the ancestral lineage of human and chimpanzee . future experiments, such as fish mapping, are needed to resolve these two different findings. interestingly, it appears that two independent duplications had inserted two subunits  in front of the distal cyan subunit of lcr22-4' before the resulting sequence was then duplicated to lcr22-3a'. alternatively, some subunits in lcr22-3a' may have originated from the proximal part of lcr22-4'. this uncertainty could not be resolved from sequence similarity, as the pair-wise sequence identity from the duplication events marked by the blue and red arrow is  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, highlighting the challenge in reconstructing past duplication events accurately.

repeat elements and duplications on 22q <dig> 
as shown in figure  <dig>  most duplication events involved in short sequences. we thus decided to investigate to what degree such small duplications have contributed to the mosaic duplication patterns of sds in 22q <dig>  and sequence shuffling between lcr <dig> blocks. the majority of subunit families  had paralogs presence in two to four blocks, which seemed to be mostly a result of recent inter-block duplication among lcr22-2', lcr22-3' and lcr22-4' . the subunit families in lcr22-2', -3', -4', -6' and -8' were quite active as more than 95% of their subunits had paralogs in other blocks. in contrast, 70% and 80% of the subunits in lcr22-5' and lcr22-7', respectively, existed as intra-block duplications . syntenic sequences to the tandem subunits of lcr22-7' were found in the genomes of chimpanzee and orangutan but not macaque , indicating the underlying duplication events occurred ~ <dig> million years ago. interestingly,  <dig> families occupied only in a single block, indicating their expansion was largely a result of local and potentially tandem duplications.

to search for potential sequence features mediating active duplications, we characterized the short sequences immediately adjacent  to duplicated subunits in 22q <dig> . first, we calculated the abundances of different sequence features, e.g., alu, line- <dig>  gene, and pseudogene, and correlated them with the "duplication activity" of individual subunit families, measured by the number of blocks a family resided. the result showed that alu/sine elements were associated much more frequently with subunit families that have undergone active expansion , suggesting alu-mediated duplications might be responsible for most of the inter-block duplications. interestingly, direct survey of the adjacent sequences of all 22q <dig>  sd subunits also found that alu was the most prevalent repeat, present in 32% of the  <dig> subunits. of all the  <dig> alu repeats next to the subunits, 30% of them were alusx and 28% were aluy, followed by alujo , alusq , and alusg . a random simulation indicated that the associations of subunits with each of these different alu types were significantly more than expected . these findings are consistent with previous reports that alu-mediated recombination events actively shuffled genes within lcr <dig> blocks and that young alu elements  were frequently enriched at the end of sds  <cit> .

cnvs flanked by paralogous subunits
sds are a major source of genome instability and they have been suggested to play an important role in the etiology of copy number variations , but the extent and features of cnvs in 22q <dig>  have not been characterized to date. to explore this, we obtained all previously annotated human cnvs and overlaid them on our map of 22q <dig>  sd subunits. due to the high sequence identity of 22q <dig>  sds, which may cause cross-hybridization signals, we only considered genome-wide cnvs detected using relatively high-resolution technology . we collected  <dig> cnvs from previous studies  . respectively, these cnvs were enriched in sds by two-fold vs non-sd region of 22q <dig> . further examination found that the two breakpoints for  <dig> of these cnvs  were located to the same duplication subunit family , providing direct evidence that some pairs of paralogous subunits could indeed mediate cnv formation by nahr . interestingly,  <dig> of these  <dig> cnvs were deletions. more surprisingly, except one in lcr22-2', all sd-overlapping cnvs were located to either lcr22-5' or lcr22-7' regions , where paralogous subunits frequently exist in tandem.

cnvs flanked by alu elements
in addition to publicly available cnv data, we have employed a bac/pac clone mapping approach to uncover cnvs on 22q <dig> . we collected dna sequence from  <dig> large insert clones, cosmids, pacs and bacs, from genbank, and their alignment to the reference 22q <dig>  sequence revealed  <dig> insertions and  <dig> deletions of sizes >  <dig> bp . four of these cnvs were more than  <dig> kb in size, one  <dig>  kb insertion, and the other three were  <dig>  kb,  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb deletions . a total of  <dig> of the remaining cnvs were relatively small , whereas  <dig> of them were intermediate in length . moreover,  <dig> and nine of these cnvs  were in the duplicated and unique regions, respectively, providing additional line of evidence that sds show significant genetic variation.

as the cnvs from large insert clone mapping  identified breakpoints down to the base-pair level, we further characterized the sequence in the vicinity of them. we found that  <dig>  of the  <dig> cnvs had at least one breakpoint terminating at an alu repeat . again, the most prevalent group was aluy, which was next to nine cnvs. the enrichment of aluy is highly significant  based on simulation. furthermore, we have compared the sequence similarity between the two short sequences immediately adjacent  to the two breakpoints of each cnv and found that nine  of the  <dig> deletion cnvs might be the result of meiotic nahr events . a pair of aluy repeats  was located at the two breakpoints of four of the nine cnvs . likewise, same repeats, one in the form of alusx-alusx and the other in the form of l1-l <dig> line, were next to the breakpoints of two cnvs. another two cnvs may be results of nahr mediated by two different sub-groups of alu, one with aluy-alusx and the other with aluy-alujo. more interestingly, we found that the generation of one cnv  may have been mediated by paralogous subunits. these subunits are part of two non-processed pseudogenes derived from glutathione s-transferase theta  gene. in summary, our analysis suggests that aluy plays a key role in the genome dynamics of 22q <dig>  by mediating the generations of both sds and cnvs, largely through nahr.

discussion
segmental duplications on 22q <dig>  are some of the most complicated sds in the human genome but the value in understanding their structure and variation among humans is because they form substrates for nahr events that can lead to gene dosage imbalance and genomic disorders. such major disorders include vcfs/dgs, the reciprocal duplication in the same interval, and cat-eye syndrome, a partial tetrasomy  <cit> . patients with vcfs/dgs and separately, the duplication syndrome have been ascertained for physical malformations including craniofacial and cardiac defects, but also due to cognitive or neurobehavioral disorders such as learning disabilities or schizophrenia .

to understand structure features in 22q <dig>  and mechanisms by which sds on 22q <dig>  confer genetic variation and cnv formation, we have decomposed them into fundamental duplication subunits to investigate sequence shuffling within lcr22s, past duplication events, and current duplications . our key finding is that some subunits are highly active in duplications and aluy, a young repeat emerging very recently during primate evolution  <cit> , is significantly associated with them, suggesting subunits next to aluy or aluy itself may be responsible for historic and current genomic rearrangements in sds on 22q <dig> . we also found that lcr22-2', lcr22-3a', and lcr22-4', the three young blocks implicated most frequently in genomic disorders, contained duplicated sequences emerging more recently than the other sds on 22q <dig> . the high sequence identity among these three blocks may explain why most pathogenic deletions are mapped to these three blocks. alternatively, phenotypes arising from genes whose function is sensitive to altered copy number will incur an ascertainment bias of these deletions.

overall, sds on 22q <dig>  share many similar and known features with other sds in the human genome in addition to alu enrichment discussed above. the cluster of sds in eight blocks is a testament of "preferential attachment"  <cit>  or "duplication shadowing", meaning that unique regions next to sds are ~ <dig> times more likely to be duplicated than random regions  <cit> . our syntenic analysis also suggests that most  22q <dig>  sds are shared between human and chimpanzee but only a small proportion of them is shared between human and macaque, a finding that is entirely consistent with previous proposition that sd activity increases after the divergence of african great apes  from the asian great ape   <cit> . our current study used sds in the human chromosome 22q <dig>  as reference, and thus sequence amplifications occurring specifically in the chimpanzee, gorilla and macaque genomes were not analyzed, but previous studies have observed amplifications specific to those lineages  <cit> .

we found that alu elements, especially young aluy, were enriched in the immediate adjacent regions of frequently duplicated sequences . our results thus extend previous findings that have shown the presence of alu elements at the endpoints of sds at a higher frequency than expected by chance   <cit>  and more specifically a three-fold enrichment of alu in the junctions of lcr <dig>  <cit> . in addition, we have previously shown that both simple and complex alu-mediated duplications stimulated by crossovers at the ends of alu elements may have contributed to the formation of unprocessed pseudogenes from the four lcr <dig> genes  <cit> . in figure  <dig>  we show that most of the breakpoints are at the ends, while a subset in the middle of alu elements, suggesting that homology based alignment is essential for cnv and sd formation, but likely there two distinct molecular mechanisms responsible, l <dig> endonuclease-mediated retrotransposition and nahr events  <cit> .

taken together, these results suggest that de novo and disease-implicated recombination events between lcr22- <dig> and lcr22- <dig> may not occur randomly but more frequently at alu-embedding subsequences, an interesting hypothesis deserving of further investigation in the future. in this regard, it is important to mention that common breakpoints found in the rearrangement of distal lcr <dig> blocks in two patients  <cit>  is located to one of the highly active subunits identified in this study , supporting that our map of duplications could be useful for studying human genomic disorders. some interesting directions to further explore our findings are,  alu sequences may be preferential sites of double strand breakage after homology based alignment  <cit> , and  chromatin modification in the vicinity of alu sequences may make a region prone for duplications as local chromatin structure  is an important factor influencing dna duplication and its subsequent evolution  <cit> . along the same line, we should note here that aluy insertion sites have been reported to show elevated recombination rates  <cit> . furthermore, we found that the recently discovered recombination hotspot motif   <cit>  was significantly enriched at the breakpoints of both sd subunits  and cnvs  in 22q <dig> .

in this report we describe our efforts of interpreting large duplication events and employing cross-genome comparison to narrow down the potential evolutionary periods. our work provides some important insights, but also highlights the complexity and challenge ahead. it is difficult to identify and time individual duplication events that have left the mosaic genome architecture of lcr22s as shown in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  during our study, we explored other complementary approaches but without significant success. for example, we examined phylogenetic relationship of orthologous and paralogous subunits using both human and syntenic sequences from other primates, but the resulting phylogenetic trees were often difficult to interpret or were only able to help resolve the precise emerging times of a limited number of duplication subunits, suggesting extensive gene conversion may have occurred among paralogous subunits. it is clear that, to achieve more from cross-species comparison, we would need more great ape genomes to be sampled more densely at finer scale of evolutionary time. otherwise, it is like trying to re-construct primate evolution with too many missing fossils. additionally, we believe that low-coverage  sequencing will provide limited help. as an example, the syntenic regions of human lcr22-2' and lcr22-4' in the reference chimpanzee genome contain some large gaps so that we were unable to extract critical evolutionary information for certain important duplication events in these two blocks - their synteny was considered ambiguous in our analysis. our study suggests that special care must be taken for comparing duplicated regions across genomes to resolve the ambiguity between overlapping alleles and duplicated paralogs with high level of sequence identity . in order to employ comparative genomics to study the molecular mechanism of genome disorders involving in complex duplicated regions, we propose that an alternative and probably more effective strategy is to establish a good reference of common cnvs for those regions. in the case of lcr22s, this will mean specifically targeting lcr22s for deep sequencing with a large number of human samples. one critical challenge is how to distinguish duplications  with high level of sequence identity  from allelic overlapping when sequence reads are too short to be aligned uniquely or assembled correctly.

CONCLUSIONS
our detailed analysis of the human 22q <dig>  region showed that many of its duplicated sequences emerged recently through both small and large-scale duplications. we also found a great number of copy number variations in 22q <dig>  and some of them may be generated by dna recombination mediated by paralogous subunits or young sine, aluy. our results suggest that genomic rearrangements in 22q <dig>  do not occur randomly and active duplicated subunits, subunits adjacent to alus, and aluy elements all play a role in making some sequences better substrates for recombination.
