BACKGROUND
in recent years, mesenchymal stem cells  have become increasingly utilised in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering applications because of their properties for self-renewal, differentiation and immunoregulation
 <cit> .

to study these properties, mscs must be isolated from their physiological niches and cultured ex vivo. the micro-environment that cells experience in laboratory culture is very different from their native settings; therefore, it is possible that the true in vivo properties of these cells might be modified by artificial culture. one environmental property that is commonly altered by the change of environment is the percentage of oxygen. traditional incubators are supplied with atmospheric air that contains 20% oxygen , which is a not physiologically accurate for any kind of cell. two common msc sources are bone marrow and adipose tissue, in which the oxygen tension ranges from 1%-7%
 <cit>  and 2%-8%
 <cit> , respectively.

all nucleated cells are able to sense and respond to the availability of o <dig> <cit> . rat mscs modify the expression of molecules involved in cell proliferation and survival when they are exposed to low oxygen tensions that approximate physiological conditions
 <cit> . hypoxia inducible factor 1α  regulates the expression of many cell cycle molecules, including p <dig>  anti-apoptotic factors, such as bcl-2
 <cit> , and pro-apoptotic proteins, such as p53
 <cit> . consequently, rat mscs exhibit different proliferation rates when cell expansion under hypoxia and normoxia are compared; however, some controversy exists regarding whether low oxygen tension enhances
 <cit>  or suppresses proliferation
 <cit> . additionally, oxygen plays an important role in the differentiation
 <cit>  and maintenance of stemness in mscs
 <cit> .

due to the inability of tendons and articulations to heal properly, msc-based therapies have been utilised in horses to treat orthopaedic disorders resulting from sporting endeavours
 <cit> . oxygen levels in cartilage are among the lowest throughout the body
 <cit> , and hypoxia appears to be essential for tendon repair
 <cit> . in addition, hypoxic preconditioning improves the therapeutic potential of human mscs
 <cit> . taken together, these facts suggest that horse mscs cultured in hypoxia might constitute a more relevant model for the treatment of injuries in low-oxygen tissues than those currently utilised, which are usually cultured in 20% o <dig> 

to improve the methodology for equine stem cell therapy, it is necessary to examine the characteristics and to compare the behaviour of mscs in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. specifically, this study contrasts the proliferation kinetics, viability, cell cycle progression, phenotype and stemness of mscs derived from bone marrow  and adipose tissue  cultured in 5% and 20% o <dig> 

RESULTS
proliferation kinetics
the growth kinetics of bm- and at-mscs expanded in normoxia and hypoxia were monitored for  <dig> days. normoxic mscs derived from both sources displayed higher number of cells than hypoxic mscs at the end of the culture.

bm-mscs exposed to both oxygen conditions showed similar lag phase ; however, the log phase lasted less in hypoxic bm-mscs, until day  <dig>  when they reached a growth plateau state, while normoxic bm-mscs continued growing slowing down their proliferation the last day of the culture period.

similarly to bm-mscs, at-mscs at 5% and 20% o <dig> showed similar lag phase and the log phase ended before in hypoxic than in normoxic at-mscs, which went on the log phase until the end of the culture period . significantly higher number of at-mscs in normoxic cultures was detected on days  <dig> and  <dig> 

cell cycle
to examine the cell cycle progression under both oxygen conditions, cellular dna content was quantified in the cultures used in the proliferation study for  <dig> days. figure
 <dig> shows the proportions of cells in each cell cycle phase observed in bm- and at-mscs expanded in normoxia and hypoxia.

cell cycle data obtained for bm-msc cultures showed that normoxic cells were more active than hypoxic cells from day  <dig> a. significantly higher percentage of normoxic bm-mscs was observed in s phase on days  <dig> and  <dig>  and in g2/m phases on day  <dig>  supporting this finding, significantly higher proportion of hypoxic bm-mscs in g0/g <dig> phases was found on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  however, hypoxic and normoxic at-mscs did not display any statistically significant difference over the course of the culture period b.

the g0/g <dig>  s and g2/m cell cycle phases were analysed for  <dig> days. cell cycle data are represented as the mean ± standard deviation. the “a” and “b” superscripted bold data are significantly different.  compares normoxic and hypoxic conditions of bm-mscs;  compares normoxic and hypoxic conditions of at-mscs;  compares bm-mscs and at-mscs in normoxic conditions; and  compares bm-mscs and at-mscs in hypoxic conditions.

comparing normoxic cultures of bm-mscs and at-mscs, bm-mscs displayed a significantly higher percentage of cells in g0/g <dig> and reduced frequency of cells in s phase compared with at-mscs on days  <dig> and  <dig>  the proportions of cells in each phase of the cell cycle were comparable throughout the remaining time course c.

differences in cell cycle progression in hypoxic mscs derived from both sources were more marked than in normoxia d. on the first day of culture, there were significantly higher percentages of at-mscs in g0/g <dig> phase and of bm-mscs in s phase. however, in the following days, until day  <dig>  this behaviour was inverted: significantly more bm-msc were in g0/g <dig>  whereas at-mscs were more active in cell division and more abundant in s phase on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and in g2/m phase on days  <dig> and  <dig> 

cell viability
possible changes in apoptosis and viability were monitored in the cells used in the proliferation study during  <dig> days using annexin v  and propidium iodide . figure
 <dig> shows the proportions of viable, apoptotic and non-viable cells in the different cultures during the culture period.

bm-mscs expanded in both oxygen atmospheres showed similar proportions of apoptotic  and non-viable cells  during the  <dig> days of culture a. however, on culture days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  a significantly higher proportion of viable cells was observed in normoxic at-mscs than in hypoxic at-mscs b. these differences were associated with a significantly higher frequency of pi+ cells in hypoxic conditions on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  while the proportion of anv+ pi- cells was similar for both conditions and never higher than 10% of the total population.

viability data are represented as the mean ± standard deviation. non-viable cells , viable cells  and apoptotic cells  were analysed for  <dig> days. superscripted bold data  are significantly different.  compares normoxic and hypoxic conditions of bm-mscs;  compares normoxic and hypoxic conditions of at-mscs;  compares bm-mscs and at-mscs in normoxic conditions; and  compares bm-mscs and at-mscs in hypoxic conditions.

comparing the viability of normoxic bm-msc and at-msc culture c, the proportions of viable bm-mscs were significantly higher than in at-mscs until day  <dig>  since then this trend reversed, being the proportion of viable cells significantly higher in at-mscs than in bm-mscs on days  <dig> and  <dig>  the differences in viability between both cell types observed at early stages of culture resulted from a significantly higher proportion of non-viable at-mscs on days  <dig> and 2; as the time of culture went by, the percentage of pi+ at-mscs became similar and the proportion of apoptotic bm-mscs increased, being significantly higher on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

the behaviour displayed by bm-mscs and at-mscs in hypoxia was similar to their normoxic equivalents until day  <dig> . however, unlike normoxic mscs, these results were maintained until the end of the culture period. in addition, the proportion of anv+pi- was similar for both cell types, which contrasts with the results of comparisons between normoxic mscs d.

immunophenotype and gene expression patterns of surface markers
the immunophenotype for the surface markers cd <dig> and cd <dig> was analysed using flow cytometry, which revealed similar expression patterns for the mscs independently of source or oxygen atmosphere . in all cases, the percentage of positive cells was greater than 93%.

data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation of percentages of mscs positive for cd <dig> and cd <dig> expression. the expression data were obtained using flow cytometry.

genes analysed, genbank accession numbers, primer sequences for reverse transcriptase rt-pcr  and amplicon sizes in base pairs .

in addition to flow cytometry, real time quantitative pcr  was performed to assess the expression of cd <dig> and cd <dig>  as well as  <dig> additional surface antigens . few significant differences in gene expression were found between cells from the same origin that were expanded in different oxygen conditions. the expression of the cd49d gene was significantly higher in normoxic bm-mscs than in their hypoxic counterparts. in at-mscs, cd <dig> expression was significantly higher in normoxia.

further differences in gene expression were observed when cultures from different sources exposed to the same oxygen tension were compared. in general, there was a trend of higher gene expression for all surface markers analysed in at-mscs, being statistically significant for cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> in normoxia and cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> in hypoxia. a tendency of a higher expression in bm-mscs was detected for cd49d in normoxia, and cd <dig> in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. similar gene expression patterns of the surface antigens cd <dig> and cd <dig> were detected in the four conditions . although the level of cd <dig> mrna was very low in hypoxic at-mscs, any significant differences existed between the two tissue sources and oxygen conditions.

hipoxia inducible factor 1α and pluripotency markers
the gene expression of hif-1α and pluripotency markers was measured in both normoxic and hypoxic cells using rt-qpcr.

gene expression of hif-1α was detected in bm-mscs and at-mscs in both oxygen conditions . the mrna levels were higher in hypoxic mscs than in normoxic mscs derived from the two sources, being statistically significant for at-mscs. bm-mscs and at-mscs expressed similar levels of hif-1α for each oxygen condition.

transcripts of the embryonic stem cell makers oct <dig>  nanog and sox <dig> were detected in bm-mscs and at-mscs expanded in both oxygen conditions . the mrna levels were consistently higher in at-mscs than in bm-mscs, with statistically significant differences for the gene expression of oct <dig> in hypoxia and nanog in normoxia.

the mscs exposed to 5% o <dig> showed a tendency to express higher levels of the three genes than the mscs exposed to 20% o <dig> 

discussion
in the equine veterinary field, orthopaedic injuries are a major cause of retirement of athletic horses
 <cit> . as a result, it is not surprising that equine regenerative medicine is primarily focused on the treatment of musculoskeletal defects. the present cell therapy studies are carried out with mscs
 <cit>  and non-adult stem cells
 <cit> . to better understand the mechanisms of action of mscs in vivo, a large number of studies to characterise equine mscs have been reported over the last five years
 <cit> . however, because the overall objective of regenerative treatments is the use of mscs in live horses, it is important to determine all of the properties of mscs in an oxygen environment that closely emulates the original physiological niche from which the cells derive. to our knowledge, the current work constitutes the first study to perform an analysis of the influence of oxygen tension on proliferation, viability, stemness and marker expression in equine mscs derived from bone marrow and adipose tissue.

the effects of hypoxia on msc proliferation have been studied specifically in humans and mice. enhancements in cell growth following exposure to hypoxia have been described
 <cit> . however, there is no unanimous consent, feher et al.  reported no difference in the growth of normoxic and hypoxic cells, and volker et al.  described similar numbers of cells for both oxygen conditions at the conclusion of the culture period. in addition, holzwarth et al. , zeng et al.  and wang et al.  reported that low oxygen tension inhibited the proliferation of mscs. similarly, canine mscs derived from bone marrow and adipose tissue exposed to atmospheric o <dig> show more proliferative capacity than those expanded from passage  <dig> to passage  <dig> under hypoxic conditions 
 <cit> . in agreement with these findings, our results describing the proliferation of equine cells as a function of oxygen tension showed that the growth of at-mscs was significantly higher at atmospheric oxygen tension, while bm-mscs underwent also more proliferation in 20% o <dig> 

differences in cell growth between cultures expanded under different oxygen conditions could result from cell cycle changes or alterations of cell viability. human msc populations derived from umbilical cord and bone marrow accumulate cells in g0/g <dig> phase under low oxygen tension
 <cit> . similar to these experiments, we found that hypoxic bm-mscs displayed a higher percentage of cells in g0/g <dig> phases than normoxic bm-mscs throughout the entire culture period. moreover, the significantly higher proportion of normoxic bm-mscs involved in the active stages of cell division  during the median days of culture led to a higher number of bm-mscs at the conclusion of proliferation assay in the normoxic culture. cellular arrest in g0/g <dig> phase in hypoxic bm-mscs might be caused by up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors that control the cell cycle checkpoint
 <cit> .

in contrast to bm-mscs, differences observed in the proliferation of normoxic and hypoxic at-msc cultures were not due to cell cycle variations, but to variations in cell viability. similarly to rat mscs, that undergo a reduction in cell viability when permanently exposed to hypoxia
 <cit> , in our work the proportions of viable at-mscs in hypoxic cultures were always lower than those in normoxic cultures. reduced viability in hypoxic conditions reflects insufficient adaptation of at-mscs at 5% o <dig>  as higher percentages of non-viable cells were found in hypoxic conditions relative to populations at 20% o <dig>  no detectable changes in apoptosis have been previously described for hypoxic mscs
 <cit> ; our results corroborate these reports since the proportion of anv+pi- did not display statistical differences between normoxic and hypoxic mscs derived from the same source.

moreover, at-mscs under either oxygen tension adapted more poorly to the culture environment following trypsinisation than bm-mscs, as shown by a significantly higher proportion of pi+ at-mscs at days  <dig> and  <dig> for both 5% and 20% o <dig> atmospheres. this is reflected in the increased lag phase displayed by at-mscs. however, at-mscs also showed a significantly increased proportion of cells undergoing cell division during the first days of culture. the increase in cell division of viable at-mscs might compensate for cell death in the population because the final number of cells obtained at the end of the experiment was higher in at-msc cultures than in bm-msc cultures, which indicates a higher proliferative ability for at-mscs than bm-mscs. this result is in agreement with previous reports in horses
 <cit>  and other species as canine
 <cit> , rat
 <cit>  and human
 <cit> , which demonstrated at-mscs proliferated more rapidly than bm-msc. in our experimental conditions, at-mscs in normoxic condition did not display a plateau phase in the proliferation curve and, at the light microscope, at-mscs start growing in several layers instead of an only monolayer . these observations might point out a lack of contact inhibition of growth in at-mscs. in addition, in a previous study, we described the more rapid decrease of apoptosis in at-mscs compared with bm-mscs in cultures at 20% o <dig> using a limited number of animals 
 <cit> . the current study confirms that finding because normoxic at-mscs showed significantly lower proportion of apoptotic cells than normoxic bm-mscs.

flow cytometric immunophenotype analysis of horse mscs revealed that the surface antigen cd <dig> was detectable in all msc types
 <cit> . in addition, cross-reactivity with human antibodies has been demonstrated for the cd <dig> antigen in a previous report from our group and also in other studies
 <cit> . because in other species hypoxia does not alter the immunophenotype of mscs with regard to cd29
 <cit>  and cd90
 <cit> , we attempted to characterise this phenotype in equine mscs and to analyse the presence of these molecules in both bm-mscs and at-mscs in hypoxia and normoxia. according to the literature, equine mscs displayed the same immunophenotype for cd <dig> and cd <dig> independently of the cell source and oxygen tension.

the lack of immunoreactivity of commercial antibodies with equine msc antigens remains a challenge in determining the immunophenotype of these cells by flow cytometry. as a supplement to this technique, rt-qpcr has been used to establish the expression profiles of various cell surface markers in equine mscs
 <cit> . similar gene expression patterns were demonstrated in at-mscs when they were compared to bm-mscs in their respective oxygen conditions. at-mscs at both oxygen tensions expressed higher levels of cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> transcripts respect to bm-mscs; in contrast, only normoxic at-mscs expressed lower mrna levels of cd49d compared to normoxic bm-mscs. these results are in agreement with our previous report
 <cit> . the differences in cd <dig> expression, with respect to our previous work, might be due to individual differences because different animals were used in the present study. hypoxia seemed to significantly modify mrna levels of cd49d in bm-mscs and cd <dig> in at-mscs, which is in agreement with other studies that have described different expression profiles for cd49d <cit>  and cd <dig> <cit>  in hypoxia. the remaining surface markers analysed in this study showed similar gene expression pattern at the different oxygen conditions studied.

hif-1α is a transcription factor that is expressed constitutively in cells, although is ubiquitinated and degraded under normoxic conditions. in our study, the gene expression of this factor was detected in normoxic and hypoxic cultures, although hif-1α was up-regulated in cultures exposed to low oxygen tension.

the expression of specific markers characteristic of embryonic stem cells have been described before for equine bm-mscs
 <cit>  and at-mscs
 <cit> . however, to our knowledge, this is the first work that compares the gene expression of the pluripotency markers oct <dig>  nanog and sox <dig> in equine at-mscs and bm-mscs that were exposed to different oxygen concentrations. in our experimental conditions, equine mscs expressed all three pluripotency markers. in general, higher expression of each marker was detected in at-mscs and was statistically significant for oct <dig> in hypoxia and for nanog in normoxia. the consistently higher expression of all genes in hypoxia might reflect the enhanced stemness of hypoxic equine mscs
 <cit> . these results agree with other studies that have described up-regulation of pluripotency-associated markers of hypoxic mscs
 <cit> . to our knowledge the relationship between pluripotency markers and hif-1α has never been investigated in mscs. however, studies in cancer cells have revealed the expression of hif-1α induces a gene expression increase of genes involved in stemness
 <cit> ; in accordance with this, the higher expression of hif-1α observed in hypoxic cultures of equine mscs could enhance the gene expression of the pluripotency markers. taken together, the results might suggest that low oxygen tension helps maintain the undifferentiated stem cell phenotype.

CONCLUSIONS
oxygen plays a deterministic role in equine msc cultures. it is able to modify their proliferative capacity via cell cycle modification in bm-mscs and alterations in cell viability in at-mscs. moreover, the immunophenotype of both msc types is not altered by hypoxia. however, hypoxia appears to be an important factor in the maintenance or acquisition of stemness in equine mscs.
