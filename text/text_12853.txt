BACKGROUND
chromatin components are key regulators of global gene expression. h2a.z is a highly conserved histone variant that replaces h2a in a subset of nucleosomes, most prominently those that flank the transcription start sites  of protein-coding genes . tss-adjacent h2a.z localization is suggestive of a role in transcriptional regulation and indeed h2a.z has been implicated in gene regulation in multiple organisms  <cit> . as h2a.z is essential for normal development  <cit>  and its over-expression is associated with poor patient prognosis in human cancers  <cit> , it is important to understand how h2a.z contributes to the regulation of gene expression.

previous studies linking h2a.z to transcription have primarily focused on protein-coding genes. it has recently become clear that eukaryotic transcriptomes are a complex mixture of coding and non-coding transcripts, with many transcripts being rapidly turned over by rna-processing machinery such as the exosome . in s. cerevisiae, such cryptic unstable transcripts often originate from the 5′ nucleosome-depleted-region  of a downstream tandemly arranged gene and can be detected in the absence of the exosome catalytic component rrp <dig>  <cit> . in this study, we used yeast strains lacking rrp <dig> to compare h2a.z occupancy to global transcription and found that h2a.z occupies the 3′ ends of protein-coding genes in addition to its well-known enrichment at their 5′ ends. h2a.z is co-localised with other active histone modifications at the 3′ end of genes, at sites that match the start sites of non-coding transcripts transcribed in the antisense orientation relative to the sense protein-coding genes. the deletion of h2a.z results in the down-regulation of antisense transcripts that normally have h2a.z in their promoters. this novel association between h2a.z and antisense transcripts differs fundamentally from the previously described role of h2a.z in supressing antisense transcripts in fission yeast  <cit> . our findings indicate that h2a.z is a general marker of tsss and suggest that some apparently indirect effects of h2a.z deletion on the expression of protein-coding genes whose promoters do not contain h2a.z are mediated through effects on an antisense transcript.

RESULTS
h2a.z is significantly enriched at the 3′ ends of genes
numerous chip-chip and chip-seq studies, in various organisms and cell types, have revealed high enrichment of h2a.z at the promoters of protein-coding genes. in this study we used highly specific antibodies  to endogenous untagged budding yeast h2a.z  in chip-seq experiments to assess whether there were other, less obvious, patterns of htz <dig> enrichment that had hitherto gone un-noticed. we found that besides the high enrichment of htz <dig> at the 5′ ends of protein coding genes, htz <dig> is also enriched at the 3′ ends and inside coding sequences . chip-seq analysis in an htz1∆ strain confirmed that these signals are all specific to htz <dig> . quantification of chip-seq signals revealed that about one-third of the htz <dig> signal is found outside of the 5′ ends of protein-coding genes, at 3′ ends, intergenic and intragenic regions . notably, the 3′ ends of genes harbour nearly 15% of the htz <dig> signal and the density of htz <dig> occupancy  is higher at 3′ ends than at intra- and inter-genic regions . out of  <dig> protein coding genes,  <dig> have a high level of htz <dig> at their 3′ end, while  <dig> have high htz <dig> levels at their 5′ ends. clustering of the htz <dig> distributions along genes revealed that some have htz <dig> only at their 5′ or 3′ ends while others have htz <dig> at both 5′ and 3′ ends . although prior studies have primarily focused on the tss-adjacent occupancy of h2a.z, coleman-derr et al. have observed enrichment of h2a.z in gene bodies and 3′ ends in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , in agreement with our findings in s. cerevisiae.figure  <dig>

peaks of h2a.z at the 3′ ends of genes correlate with other active histone marks
as antisense transcription is widespread in budding yeast  <cit> , we hypothesised that the prominent peaks of htz <dig> at the 3′ ends of genes could reflect the tsss of antisense transcripts initiating in these regions. if this were the case, the 3′ peaks of htz <dig> would be expected to co-localise with histone modifications that are normally present at actively transcribed promoters. we examined levels of histone modifications that are known to be enriched in the promoter regions of active genes  <cit>  and observed that the 3′ regions with high htz <dig> occupancy are significantly enriched for active histone marks, including h3k4me <dig>  h3k18ac, h3k9ac and h4k12ac . the correlations we observe between 3′ htz <dig> occupancy and other marks of active promoters are consistent with these 3′ peaks of htz <dig> potentially being promoters of antisense transcripts.figure  <dig>

h2a.z at the 3′ end of genes marks the start of antisense transcripts
to directly test whether 3′ peaks of htz <dig> correspond to the start sites of antisense transcripts, we next compared htz <dig> occupancy to strand-specific transcript data generated from a strain lacking the exosomal rna-degrading enzyme, rrp <dig>  we focused on the htz <dig> signal located upstream rather than downstream of the transcription end site  in order to avoid htz <dig> signal that is potentially derived from the 5′ promoter of the adjacent gene in the compact s. cerevisiae genome. we observed a total number of  <dig> antisense transcripts in the rrp6Δ strain and the htz <dig> peaks at the 3′ ends of genes frequently correspond to the 5′ ends of antisense transcripts . over 50% of genes with htz <dig> occupancy in their 3′ end have a detectable antisense transcript in the rrp6Δ strain, while only 5% of genes without 3′ htz <dig> have an antisense transcript . the frequency of antisense transcripts in 3′ regions that are enriched for htz <dig> is significantly higher than expected  and, conversely, the frequency is significantly lower than expected  in 3′ regions lacking htz <dig> . randomisation of the htz <dig> peaks at the 3′ ends of all genes generated a distribution of peaks coinciding with antisense transcripts that is markedly lower than the actual number we observe, with a false discovery rate close to zero . we have focused on peaks at the 3′ end of genes because of this striking overlap but we also observed that a lower percentage of coding region htz <dig> peaks overlap with the start sites of antisense transcripts . our findings implicate htz <dig> as a general marker of tsss, for both sense and antisense transcripts. as at the 5′ ends of protein-coding genes, where htz <dig> is widespread but not at every gene promoter , htz <dig> is not a ubiquitous feature of the 5′ ends of antisense transcripts. this is comparable to other chromatin components that have been implicated in regulating antisense transcript levels, including the atp-dependent remodeler isw <dig>  <cit> , the histone deacetylase complexes rpd3s  <cit>  and set3c  <cit> , and methylation of h3k <dig>  <cit> , which also mark or regulate a sub-set of antisense transcripts.figure  <dig>

h2a.z is important for antisense transcript levels
to test whether htz <dig> binding at the 3′ ends of genes contributes to regulation of antisense transcripts, we examined the antisense transcriptomes in rrp6∆ and rrp6∆htz1∆ cells. to establish which transcripts are likely to be regulated directly by htz <dig>  we compared changes in transcript levels in the absence of htz <dig> to htz <dig> occupancy . this analysis revealed that the majority of affected antisense transcripts are enriched for htz <dig>  consistent with a direct effect for htz <dig> in regulating these transcripts although indirect effects are also formally possible. notably, down-regulated antisense transcripts have significantly higher htz <dig> occupancy at their 5′ ends  while promoters of up-regulated antisense transcripts are less enriched for htz <dig> . quantification of up- and down-regulated antisense transcripts revealed that the down-regulation of antisense transcripts occurs significantly more often than expected for genes with 3′ htz <dig> occupancy . in addition, the occupancy of htz <dig> at the 3′ ends of genes is positively correlated with antisense transcript levels in the wild-type strain . together, these data are consistent with a predominantly activating effect for htz <dig> at the promoters of antisense transcripts. while we also observe a predominantly activating effect for htz <dig> at the 5′ ends of genes on sense transcripts, the effect is weaker than for antisense transcripts, as the p-values are markedly higher than at the 3′ ends .figure  <dig>

antisense transcripts that depend on h2a.z are primarily transcribed from tandemly arranged genes
h2a.z has previously been implicated in the regulation of antisense transcript levels in the fission yeast s. pombe, although in that case h2a.z supresses antisense transcript levels specifically at convergently transcribed genes by preventing transcriptional read-through  <cit> . as h2a.z was not observed at the 3′ ends of genes in that study and had the opposite effect on antisense transcript levels, this previously described role of h2a.z appears mechanistically different from what we have observed in budding yeast. nonetheless, we checked whether there was a similar tendency of htz <dig> to regulate antisense transcripts at convergent genes in budding yeast. we divided all intergenic regions into  <dig> classes depending on whether their flanking protein-coding genes were tandemly or convergently arranged and on the distance between the protein coding genes . “close” genes are separated by < <dig> bp, while “far” genes have > <dig> bp between their tsss/transcription end sites . we found that most of the 3′ htz <dig> signal is found in tandemly arranged genes rather than convergently arranged genes, and is particularly enriched in the “tandem close” category . to further investigate the relationship between gene organisation and the effect of htz <dig> on antisense levels, we examined the number of genes in each category whose antisense transcripts are down-regulated in the absence of htz <dig> . this analysis also demonstrates a significant enrichment in the tandem close category , indicating that htz <dig> primarily affects antisense transcripts that are initiated from the promoters of tandemly arranged genes. the role of h2a.z at the tss of antisense transcripts in s. cerevisiae is therefore distinct from its previously described function in suppressing read-through antisense transcripts at convergent genes in s. pombe. this may reflect a difference in transcriptome organisation between s. cerevisiae and s. pombe, as the majority of antisense transcripts in s. pombe are generated by transcriptional read-through at convergent genes  <cit>  while most antisense transcripts are derived from tandem genes in s. cerevisiae  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
htz <dig> predominantly affects tandemly arranged sense/antisense genes. a. genomic arrangement of the  <dig> gene categories, with sense transcripts depicted as light blue boxes on the + or – strand and antisense transcripts shown as dark blue boxes. tandem or convergent refers to the sense transcripts. close genes have < <dig> bp between them, while the distance is > <dig> bp for the “far” genes. the coloured box for each category is the key for b, c & d. b. htz <dig> levels at the 3' ends of genes, aligned by tess and coloured according to a. the arrow indicates the 3' peak upstream of the tes that we have focused on. convergent genes have less htz <dig> associated with their 3' ends, with “tandem close” genes having the highest htz <dig> levels. c. quantification of the 3' htz <dig> signal shows that the majority of 3' htz <dig> is found at tandem genes. d. htz <dig> affects a significant number of tandem close antisense transcripts. the number of antisense transcripts down-regulated in rrp6∆htz1∆ was compared to the number in that category in the genome for each of the  <dig> gene arrangements. the p values are derived from fisher’s exact tests.



regulation of antisense transcripts by h2a.z can affect sense transcript levels
htz <dig> has previously been implicated in regulating sense transcripts and we now show that it affects antisense transcripts in budding yeast. levels of sense and antisense transcripts at individual genes are generally anti-correlated , which raises the question of whether the regulation of antisense transcripts by htz <dig> affects sense transcript levels. we took genes with antisense transcripts and 3′ htz <dig> occupancy, and examined the changes in sense transcript levels for genes where the antisense transcript either didn’t change, went up, or went down. genes whose antisense transcript decreases in the absence of htz <dig> show a corresponding increase in sense transcript levels . conversely, the expression levels of sense transcripts corresponding to up-regulated antisense transcripts were decreased .figure  <dig> 
the effect of htz <dig> on antisense transcript levels impacts sense transcripts. a. genes with 3' htz <dig> enrichment and an antisense transcript were divided into three groups based on whether their antisense transcript levels were unchanged , up-  or down-  regulated in rrp6∆htz1∆. the boxplots show changes in sense  transcript levels for these groups. down-regulated antisense transcripts have a significantly higher fold change in sense expression , two-tailed t-test) and conversely sense transcript levels are significantly decreased when antisense transcripts are up-regulated , two-tailed t-test). b. classification of genes with both sense and antisense transcripts according to 5' and 3' enrichment of htz <dig> was performed using thresholds for 5' and 3' enrichment based on average htz <dig> occupancies at the 5' and 3' ends. class  <dig>  have only 5' enrichment; class  <dig>  have 5' and 3' enrichment; class  <dig>  are not enriched for htz <dig> at either 5' or 3' ends; and class  <dig>  have htz <dig> only at the 3' end. c. distributions of sense transcript fold changes in the rrp6∆htz1∆ strain for each of the classes of genes illustrated in b. sense transcripts are significantly up-regulated in group  <dig> genes that have htz <dig> at their 3' ends only , two-tailed t-test).



it is challenging to dissect the dependencies of sense/antisense transcript levels due to their inter-connected nature but the fact that htz <dig> is more enriched at down-regulated sense and antisense transcripts leads us to propose a model in which the effects of htz <dig> on down-regulated transcripts are direct and that up-regulated transcript levels generally result from an effect on the corresponding sense/antisense. to test this, we divided genes into  <dig> groups based on their htz1-enrichment patterns . group  <dig> genes have htz <dig> at their 5′ ends only and, based on our observations of sense transcript levels , we would predict that levels of group  <dig> transcripts should decrease slightly when htz <dig> is deleted. although the median log  expression is lower than  <dig> in this group, it is not significantly lowered. the behaviour of group  <dig> genes is unpredictable as they have htz <dig> at both 5′ and 3′ ends, and changes at group  <dig> genes  can be attributed to indirect effects. however, group  <dig> genes  are predicted to have up-regulated sense transcripts and indeed we find that group  <dig> genes are significantly up-regulated . these findings are consistent with htz <dig> having an effect on antisense transcripts that consequently affects sense transcript levels and may indicate that htz <dig> is more important for the activation of antisense transcripts than sense transcripts.

CONCLUSIONS
we find in this study that a significant proportion of htz <dig> is located at the 5′ ends of antisense transcripts, and that htz <dig> is required for normal levels of these non-coding transcripts in addition to its known role in regulating protein-coding genes. comparison of strand-specific rna-seq and chip-seq data shows that htz <dig> occupancy has a predominantly activating effect on the promoters of antisense and sense transcripts. previous work has described both activating and repressing roles for h2a.z at individual genes in both yeast and mammalian cells . while some genes that are up-regulated in htz1Δ have htz <dig> at their promoters, these are relatively rare and most promoters of up-regulated transcripts have low htz <dig> occupancy, arguing against a direct repressive effect of htz <dig> on most transcripts, as previously observed by li et al.  <cit>  for protein-coding genes. however, up-regulation of protein coding genes that lack htz <dig> in their promoters is not due to completely indirect effects, at least in some cases, but is mediated by htz <dig> affecting levels of antisense transcripts generated from the 3′ ends of these genes. mechanistically, some changes of sense transcript levels in htz1Δ strains have previously been ascribed to the aberrant activity of the swr-c when htz <dig> is absent  <cit> . we could not test whether swr <dig> is responsible for the changes in as levels in rrp6Δhtz1Δ because we were unable to generate strains triply mutated for rrp6Δhtz1Δ and swr1Δ.

the importance of h2a.z for antisense transcription may explain some of its apparently conflicting effects on the expression of protein coding genes and highlights the need to study all transcripts derived from a locus in order to fully understand how genes are regulated.
