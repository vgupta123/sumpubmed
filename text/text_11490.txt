BACKGROUND
dihydroorotase  catalyzes the reversible interconversion of carbamoyl aspartate and dihydroorotate, the third step in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. the protein is a member of the amidohydrolase family of enzymes  <cit>  figure  <dig> 

the same reaction occurs in nearly all organisms but the enzymes are very diverse. a phylogenetic analysis  <cit>  demonstrated that dhos belong to two distinct classes that differ in sequence, size and oligomeric structure. type-i enzymes, which evolved first, are larger, 43– <dig> kda, and are often associated with aspartate transcarbamoylase , the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of carbamoyl aspartate, the substrate for dho. type-ii dhos, which evolved more recently, contain only the catalytic core  and typically have  <dig> and  <dig> residues deleted from the amino and carboxyl ends, respectively, as well as several internal insertions and deletions compared to the type-i enzymes.

e. coli dho, a type-ii enzyme, is an eight stranded β- or tim barrel, a structural organization typical of amidohydrolyases  <cit> . while this enzyme was initially reported to have a mononuclear metal center  <cit> , the x-ray structure showed that there are two zinc ions at the active site  bridged by a water molecule and a carboxylated lysine . the zinc in the α-site has a distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination sphere and binds two histidines, an aspartate, the carboxylated lysine and the bridging solvent. the zinc in the β-site is more solvent accessible and has a distorted tetrahedral coordination sphere consisting of two histidines, the carboxylated lysine and the bridging hydroxide. a catalytic mechanism was proposed based on the presence of two zinc ions and the juxtaposition of residues near the bound substrates  <cit> .

we have cloned and expressed aquifex aeolicus dho, a type-i enzyme in e. coli <cit> . the recombinant protein, with a molecular mass of  <dig> kda, was expressed at high levels and was soluble but lacked catalytic activity. the enzyme was monomeric and contained a single zinc ion. however, it formed an active complex with a. aeolicus atc consisting of six copies of each type of subunit that had both atc and dho activities  <cit> . the structure of the isolated dho subunit, determined in two space groups is comprised of two domains, a distorted tim barrel that resembles the structure of e. coli dho and a composite domain formed by residues 1– <dig> at the amino end and 366– <dig> at the carboxyl end of the polypeptide  <cit>  that is found in many metal-dependent hydrolases  <cit> .

the two a. aeolicus dho structures suggested several possibilities that could account for the lack of activity of the isolated subunit. a water molecule was bound to the zinc in one x-ray structure , while in the other structure , cys <dig> in a loop, designated loop a, was ligated to the active site zinc, occluding the active site and blocking access of the substrates. most of loop a was disordered and invisible in the electron density map, as were two other loops, b and c. the zinc ion was bound to a site corresponding to the less solvent accessible α-site in the e. coli enzyme. the zinc ligands were his <dig>  his <dig>  asp <dig>  and  or cys <dig> in an approximately tetrahedral arrangement . the equivalent ligands for the zinc β-site in e. coli dho were conserved but disarranged. asp <dig> was close to the analogous carboxylysine in e. coli dho but the two equivalent histidine ligands, his <dig> nd <dig> and his <dig> ne <dig>  were rotated out of the active site by  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å, respectively, from the putative zinc β-position.

the x-ray structure of the active a. aeolicus dho-atc complex  showed that all of the disordered loops now had a well-defined conformation and that an extensive movement of loop a had displaced it from the active site  <cit> . the zinc in the α-site now had tetrahedral geometry with his <dig>  his <dig>  asp <dig>  and one oxygen from citrate, a substrate analog, as ligands, with an average bond distance of  <dig>  Å. the next closest ligand for trigonal bipyramidal coordination was asp <dig> at  <dig>  Å. moreover, the β-zinc binding site was fully reconstituted when the dho and atc subunits associate to form the active dodecamer. however, no zinc was bound to the putative β-site, instead a water molecule, hoh <dig>   occupied this position. as a consequence, one of the carbonyl oxygens of asp <dig> that was formerly bound to the n of gly <dig> now formed a hydrogen bond  with the water molecule in the putative β-site. in addition, his <dig> and his <dig> rotate into the active site forming tight hydrogen bonds  with the same water molecule upon formation of the dho-atc complex . consequently, the positions of the zinc ligands were virtually the same as the corresponding β-zinc ligands in the e. coli enzyme .

in mammals, dihydroorotase is a domain of a large multifunctional protein called cad that also catalyzes the atc and glutamine dependent carbamoyl phosphate synthetase activities  <cit> . it was previously found that mammalian dho has a single active site zinc  <cit> . however, recent structural studies carried out by santiago ramon-maiques , madrid, spain) showed that the dho domain of human cad, like the e. coli enzyme, has two zincs at the active sitea.

several observations have led many investigators to believe that the active site of all dhos are binuclear, 1) the β-zn site ligands are universally conserved, 2) these residues are located in the correct position  with an appropriate orientation to bind a second zinc, 3) the β-site is significantly more accessible to solvent, so that the second zinc may have been lost during protein purification or crystallization, 4) zinc analysis was typically preceded by dialysis to remove adventitiously bound metal  <cit>  that may have resulted in the loss of the second metal ion and 5) both e. coli and mammalian dho, which were initially found to have one zinc, were subsequently shown to have two metal ions.

the current study was undertaken to determine whether the lack of a second metal ion in a. aeolicus dho is an artifact or whether the reversible condensation of carbamoyl aspartate to form dihydroorotate can be catalyzed by a mononuclear metal center.

RESULTS
metal analysis of the dho-atc complex and subunits
zinc analysis by icp-mass spectrometry confirmed the results of previous studies  <cit>  that indicated that the purified, isolated dho subunit has only one mole of zinc per mole of protein . the analysis also showed that the protein had no detectable bound cobalt, another metal ion that can support dho catalysis. the growth media for the over-expression of atc and dho subunits was usually not supplemented with metals, so one possibility is that the β-site may have been unoccupied because the availability of the metal ion was limiting. to test this possibility, the growth media was supplemented with  <dig> μm or  <dig> mm zncl <dig>  the protein isolated from these different growth media  also had one zinc atom and no cobalt, indicating that the unsupplemented media contained sufficient metal ions to saturate the protein metal binding sites. similarly, the addition of zn2+ or co2+ to the purified dho subunit did not significantly increase the incorporation of either metal ion .

the zinc content of the dho subunit and the dho-atc complex was also determined by a colorimetric 4- resorcinol  assay . the analysis  was conducted at 25°c, the temperature at which the crystals were grown, and at 75°c, the temperature at which the enzymes were assayed. analysis of the atc subunit showed that it contained no detectable zinc. the dho subunit had about  <dig>  equivalents of zinc at 25°c and 75°c indicating that the metal binding α-site was not completely occupied. the dho subunit was then incubated with a 5-fold stoichiometric excess zinc, followed by removal of the excess metal by spin column chromatography. zinc analysis indicated that the zinc content increased to  <dig> - <dig> , consistent with the interpretation that there was a small loss of zinc during the purification of protein. the presence of edta did not significantly alter the zinc content of the isolated dho subunit.

a similar series of experiments was carried out on the dho-atc complex. this analysis  indicated that the protein contained slightly less than one equivalent of zinc per dho subunit, a value that increased to give approximately one-to-one stoichiometry when excess zinc was provided. again, the zinc content was not appreciably altered by the addition of edta.

titration of dho-atc complex with zinc and cobalt
to determine whether additional exogenous metal ions had an effect on the catalytic activity of the dho-atc, the complex was titrated with metal ions . there was a small activation of the dho, approximately 20%, as the molar ratio of zinc ion to protein increased, a further indication that the α-site was not fully occupied. a similar result was obtained when the complex was titrated with cobalt chloride.

the endogenous zinc ion was extracted from the dho subunit by exhaustive dialysis against the strong chelating agent, pyridine- <dig>  6-dicarboxylate . the complete removal of the metal was confirmed by zinc analysis. the metal free apoenzyme had no catalytic activity and was then titrated with zinc chloride and cobalt chloride. the endpoint with both metal ions corresponded to a molar ratio of the metal ion to protein of one. there was only a slight increase in catalytic activity with increasing in zinc beyond the endpoint of the titration curve. the titration curves for zinc chloride and cobalt chloride were almost identical, indicating that both metal ions are equally effective in promoting catalysis.

effect of excess zinc on the steady state kinetics of dho-atc
although additional zinc had no apparent effect on the activity at near saturating concentrations of the substrate, excess metal ion may alter the steady state kinetic parameters. the dihydroorotate saturation curve for the dho-atc complex at 75°c  gave km value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm and a vmax of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/min. the corresponding values for the complex assayed in the presence of a 5-fold molar excess of zinc gave km and vmax values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/min, respectively. thus, there was little effect of additional metal ions on dho catalysis or substrate binding.

x-ray structure of the β-site mutantsb
two residues, his <dig> and his <dig>  that bind the second zinc ion in the β-site  of type-i dho  and type-ii enzymes ; s. tymphurium, 3jze.pdb) and interact with a water molecule in a. aeolicus dho , were replaced with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. the single and the double his180ala/his232ala were constructed. the double mutant was crystallized under similar conditions as the wild type enzyme  <cit>  except that citrate, which binds weakly to the dho and atc active sites, was omitted. both the dho substrate, dihydroorotate, and the atc bisubstrate analogue, pala, were included in the “cryo” solution in an attempt to increase the order and thus the x-ray diffraction of the crystals. however, after preliminary refinements at higher resolutions, the data were truncated to  <dig>  Å,  <dig>  Å better than the native complex, at a conservative value of  <dig>  for i/σ in the last shell. the final r-factor, using tls refinement, is  <dig>  and the final rfree is  <dig> .

the asymmetric unit in space group h <dig> includes one dho subunit with one zinc atom and dihydroorotate in its active site, one atc subunit with pala in its active site, three barium atoms bound to the atc subunit, and twelve ethylene glycol molecules . the barium ions, which increase the reproducibility, size, and diffraction of the crystals, have anomalous difference density peaks at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  sigma and are bound to the atc subunit, which makes the sole crystal contact in the unit cell. the barium ions are quickly lost if omitted from the “cryo” solution, as was done with the native structure  <cit> . in this structure , the biological unit in the crystal is the same as the native structure, a tightly bound dodecamer with  <dig> symmetry formed by six asymmetric units. the full set of x-ray structure parameters are given in table  <dig>  the crystal structure of the double mutant showed strong anomalous difference density for zinc at the alpha site  and none at the beta site at the 3σ contour level . consequently, zn <dig> at the alpha site was refined at full occupancy and a water molecule assigned to the a-chain, hoh2080/a, was placed at the putative zinc beta site .

properties of the β-site mutants
in the absence of exogenous zinc, the stoichiometry of metal binding to the double mutant  exhibited somewhat less than one to one stoichiometry. the molar ratio of zn/protein was  <dig>  –  <dig>  for both the isolated dho subunit and the dho-atc complex. as observed with the wild type enzyme, the occupancy increased to approximately 100% in the presence of a 5-fold molar excess of zinc. the zinc titration of the his180ala and his232ala mutants resembled that of the wild type enzyme in that the catalytic activity increased approximately 20% in the presence of exogenous zinc, presumably the result of filling the incompletely occupied σ-zinc site. in contrast, there was only a modest increase in the activity of the double mutant with increasing exogenous zinc.

dihydroorotate saturation curves of the dho-atc complex reconstituted with the dho mutants and native atc  indicated that the steady state kinetic parameters  of the wild type, his180ala and his232ala mutants were very similar. the km of the double mutant was unaltered  but there was a small  but significant decrease in the vmax.

discussion
metal analysis, the x-ray structure  <cit>  and anomalous scattering difference maps showed that the isolated, inactive a. aeolicus dho subunit has a single, functional zinc-binding site. however, the extensive reorganization of the dho structure that occurs upon formation of a complex with atc, results in the generation of a catalytically active protein with an intact putative second metal binding site . thus, the possibility that a zinc ion was lost during crystallization raises the question that a second, more loosely bound zinc ion could be required for activity. the initial metal analysis of e. coli and human dho revealed a single active site metal ion, but both enzymes were subsequently found to have a binuclear metal center, an observation that lends credence to this hypothesis. the consensus is emerging that all dihydroorotases are binuclear. the distinction could be important as different strategies could be envisioned in the design of drugs that target dho depending on whether the active site has one or two metal ions. differences in the metal center might be exploited to distinguish, for example, between human and some pathogenic dhos.

to test the possibility that the a. aeolicus dho may require a second zinc ion, the isolated dho-atc complex was titrated with zinc and the catalytic activity was assayed. the observed small increase in catalytic activity could be explained if the α-site metal ion occupancy was somewhat less than 100%. this interpretation was confirmed by zinc analysis of the isolated dho subunit and the dho-atc complex, which showed that the occupancy of the isolated dho subunit from which the dodecamer was reconstituted was  <dig>  zinc/mol of subunit. similarly, the steady state kinetic parameters were unaltered in the presence of a five-fold molar excess of zinc.

the most convincing evidence demonstrating that a second zinc ion is not required for catalysis was the replacement of two β-site first shell ligands, his <dig> and his <dig>  with alanine, which eliminated the β-site but had no significant effect on the steady state kinetic parameters. in contrast, the replacement of the corresponding histidines in the β site of klebsiella pneumoniae dihydroorotase  <cit>  and allantoinase  <cit> , both of which have a binuclear metal site, completely abolished catalytic activity. the crystal structure of the active double mutant showed a zinc atom in the α-site and a water molecule jβ  near the β-site  - thus eliminating the unlikely possibility that the one zinc atom was randomly distributed between the two sites. the observation that the elimination of the β-site ligands of the binuclear metal site enzymes abolishes catalytic activity, whereas there is no effect if the comparable ligands in the mononuclear enzyme are replaced, reinforces the argument that the two types of enzymes are distinct.

an alternate possibility should be considered that perhaps all dihydroorotases utilize a single zinc atom for catalysis and that the second zinc serves another purpose, perhaps enhancing the stability of the protein. this idea is countered by the mutagenesis studies, although it could be argued that the β-site ligands have an alternate unknown role in catalysis. however, we believe that this hypothesis is unlikely to be true as a plausible two-metal mechanism for e. coli dho has been proposed based on the structure  <cit>  that is well supported by subsequent biochemical  <cit>  and quantum mechanical studies  <cit> . we have recently undertaken a molecular dynamics/quantum mechanical investigation based on the structure of the a. aeolicus dho-atc complex  <cit>  that suggests that a one-zinc dho can readily catalyze the reaction by an analogous, albeit somewhat different, mechanism. as discussed below, there is ample precedence for amidohydrolases catalyzing the same reaction having either one or two zinc ions depending on the organism.

mechanistic considerations
the structure of the double mutant enzyme offers other insights that are potentially relevant to the mechanism of the native enzyme. first, the catalytic water molecule, which is bound to the two zincs as jα5β <dig> in the e. coli enzyme  and the one zinc as jα <dig> in a. aeolicus dho  is retained in the mutant structure , where it is poised, as in the e. coli complex with dihydroorotate , to attack and cleave the ring forming carbamoyl aspartate. in the substrate complex with carbamoyl aspartate  and the pseudo-substrate complex with citrate , an oxygen atom of the ligand occupies the catalytic water site and binds directly to the zinc atom.

a second notable observation is the retention of a water molecule, hoh2080/a  in the approximate location of the znβ site in the structure of the mutant dho despite the elimination of his <dig> and his <dig> that hydrogen bonds to the equivalent jβ water molecule, hoh <dig>  in the native protein complex . in the mutant dho, the space normally occupied by the imidazole rings of his <dig> and his <dig> is now occupied, respectively, by hoh <dig> and hoh <dig>  which are also hydrogen bonded with the β-site water, hoh <dig> . extensive theoretical calculations currently underway suggest that this second catalytic water molecule can significantly lower the activation energy of the reaction.

although the mutant a. aeolicus dho has alanine replacing the two histidines and dihydroorotate replacing citrate, it is still very similar to the native structure as evidenced by a rmsd value of  <dig>  Å for the  <dig> cα atoms. the two largest cα displacements - met <dig>  and pro <dig>  - occur in the composite domain, which has higher b-values and worse density than the tim-barrel catalytic domain, for which all the cα displacements are less than one angstrom. this modest sensitivity to the ligand in the active site contrasts strongly with e. coli dho, in which a mobile loop  is hydrogen bonded to the substrate, carbamoyl aspartate, via residues thr <dig> and thr <dig> but flipped out of the active site when the product, dihydroorotate, is present   <cit> . the α-carbons of the two threonines are shifted by approximately  <dig> Å. when the mutant dho is superposed using ssm onto the e. coli dho subunit containing dihydroorotate , met <dig> and asp <dig> align structurally with asn <dig> and ser <dig>  respectively in the e. coli subunit. in other words, ssm identifies the mobile loop in e. coli dho, as a ten residue insert compared to the structure of a. aeolicus dho. interestingly, when the mutant dho structure is superposed onto the e. coli dho subunit containing carbamoyl aspartate , there are no a. aeolicus residues equivalent to thr <dig> and thr <dig> to hydrogen bond to the substrate. however, this observation must be verified by determining the structure of a. aeolicus dho with the carbamoyl aspartate substrate in its active site.

atc conformational changes induced by pala
the mutant dho-atc structure is the first with the bisubstrate analog, n-phosphoacetyl l-aspartate  bound to the active site of the a. aeolicus atc subunit . the pala-atc subunit superposes onto the native structure with an rmsd value of  <dig>  Å for  <dig> residues and exhibits two major conformational changes triggered by pala replacing citrate in the active site. the residues from ser <dig> to glu <dig> have cα displacements above  <dig> Å with a maximum of  <dig>  Å at ser <dig>  together, ser <dig> and lys <dig> in this segment form hydrogen bonds - five in the mutant structure - directly to the pala in the adjacent catalytic subunit, as first reported for e. coli atc  <cit> . the second major conformational change involves segment arg <dig> through asn <dig>  which has a maximum cα displacement of  <dig>  Å at gln <dig>  arg <dig> and gln <dig> form hydrogen bonds directly with the c <dig> carboxyl group of pala. the large displacement of gln <dig>  which has no significant interactions with pala or other residues, is a consequence, and not a cause, of the conformational change. an adjacent residue, arg <dig>  which has a cα displacement of  <dig>  Å, interacts indirectly with pala through a hydrogen bond network with the pala ligands gln <dig>  and arg <dig> 

in e. coli atc, pala binding triggers the transition from the t state to the active r state. although the two largest conformational changes induced by pala are “homologous” in the a. aeolicus and e. coli atc, the former is much less plastic. the mutant a. aeolicus atc has only  <dig> out of  <dig> residues with a cα displacement greater than  <dig>  Å relative to the native structure whereas the e. coli enzyme has  <dig> out of  <dig> residues that move over  <dig>  Å due to pala binding. this difference in conformational flexibility might be due to the native a. aeolicus structure having citrate bound in the pala site, so it is already partially in the r-state, or to the a. aeolicus atc being part of a larger complex that inhibits widespread conformational changes.

e. coli atc, which is a complex of two trimers of catalytic chains and three dimers of regulatory chains, is notable for its large quaternary changes associated with the t to r transition upon pala binding. the hetero dodecamer expands by  <dig> Å and the two trimers rotate by  <dig> degrees relative to each other  <cit> . however, pala binding to the a. aeolicus mutant dodecamer, which is not an allosteric enzyme, has only a very modest effect. the “top” and “bottom” atc trimers in the mutant dodecamer generated from crystallographic symmetry, when compared to the native complex, have rotated less than  <dig> degrees relative to each other and expanded by less than  <dig>  Å.

comparison of amidohydrolase mono and dinuclear metal centers
sequence alignment  shows that the one-zinc dhos from a. aeolicus and s. aureus exhibit the highest sequence similarity  to each other. the a. aeolicus enzyme is much less similar to either of the two zinc enzymes, e. coli  or the mammalian enzyme . the differences in sequence per se cannot explain the differences between the one and two zinc enzymes, but suggest a closer phylogenetic relationship between the enzymes that bind the same number of metal ions.

although e. coli dho and all other type-ii dho structures have two zinc atoms in their active sites, the type-i dho structures vary among themselves. all of the first and second shell zinc ligands of all type i enzymes of known structure, match those of a. aeolicus dho in type and position, but only the s. aureus enzyme  has an empty β-site like the a. aeolicus dho. in contrast, the enzymes from b. anthracis <cit>   and t. thermophilus  have two active site zinc atoms, although the occupancy of the β site of the latter enzyme is only  <dig> . the residues in two ligation shells around the zinc atoms in a. aeolicus dho and the three other type-i dhos were compared to understand how the metal centers of these enzymes differ .

there is precedence for variation in the metal content of the same enzymes in the amidohydrolyase superfamily. n-acetyl-d-galactosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase   <cit>  from bacillus subtilis binds two metals, whereas naga from escherichia coli and thermotoga maritima bind a single metal ion at the β-site. e. coli naga lacks the hxh motif that forms the α-zn site in b. subtilis naga, all known type-i and type-ii dhos and many other amidohydrolases. this signature sequence is replaced by qxn and the resulting weaker metal affinity may explain why this enzyme only binds a single metal ion at the β-site  <cit> . a phylogenetic analysis  <cit>  of all the naga homologs revealed that a histidine residue located in the second ligand shell of the β-site  is conserved in all of the enzymes that cluster with the one zinc enzymes. in the two metal enzyme cluster, this residue is replaced with glu or gln. the authors suggest that the histidine may polarize the carbonyl bond of the substrate during hydrolysis, in effect compensating for the missing second metal ion.

however, this difference between the mono- and dinuclear enzymes is not found among the dihydroorotases. the four type-i dihydroorotases, both mono- and dinuclear, have a glycine residue  filling the space of the polarizing histidine imidazole ring, while the e. coli type-ii dho, has empty space. moreover, the only sequence difference in the zn ligation shells among the four type-i dho structures, which occurs at position β <dig> in figure 2c, does not correlate with zinc binding . the a. aeolicus  and t. thermophilus  enzymes have a glutamine residue at this location while s. aureus  and b. anthracis  enzymes have a cysteine residue.

sequence differences in the second shell are another common explanation for variable metal affinity of histidine-rich sites. a thermodynamic analysis of zinc binding of human carbonic anhydrase provided evidence that the second shell residues, in addition to orienting the direct ligands, can also appreciably affect the enthalpy of metal binding  <cit> . mutation of the second shell ligands gln <dig>  glu <dig>  and thr <dig> reduces the affinity of zinc binding 10-fold  <cit> . the replacement of glu <dig>  which normally forms a hydrogen bond with his <dig> in the first shell, results in a large increase in enthalpy associated with zinc binding  <cit> . the structure of this mutant  <cit>  revealed that a halide ion occupies the void created by the missing glu side chain, but otherwise the structure of the active site is not significantly different than the wild type enzyme .

aspartate or glutamate residues can act as proton acceptors for the histidine residues in the first shell and thereby strengthen their interaction with the zinc atom  <cit> . this interaction is weaker when amides occupy the second shell position. however, with the type-i dho structures, the relevant second shell ligands are the same for all four type-i dho structures - a glutamate in α1′, an asparagine in α2′, a glutamate in β1′ and water molecules in β2′ . looking deeper, the β1′ glutamic acid is significantly farther from the β <dig> histidine in both a. aeolicus  and s. aureus dho  - implying weaker zinc binding - than in t. thermophilis dho . however, the distance is just as long in b. anthracis dho , so again there is no simple correlation between the geometry and the relative metal affinity.

consequently, a complete explanation of this difference in zinc affinities of the znβ sites in the two proteins is beyond the purview of this study. for example, a recent analysis of two carbonic anhydrases had to include all atoms within  <dig> Å of the zinc atom in quantum mechanics calculations to fully explain the relative zinc affinities and catalytic properties  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these results indicate that although an apparent viable β-zinc binding site is formed when the a. aeolicus dho domain associates tightly with atc - presumably the natural state of these enzymes – the data presented here indicate that additional zinc does not bind to the enzyme or influence the catalytic activity. we therefore conclude that a. aeolicus dho-atc complex does not require a second metal for catalysis, although the conservation of the second site during evolution leaves open the possibility that a second ion might bind in vivo. however, here we have shown that this type-i dho is fully functional with a mononuclear metal center.
