BACKGROUND
cowpea  is grown extensively as a food and fodder crop in west africa, lower elevation areas of eastern and southern africa, north-eastern brazil, parts of the middle east, india, and the south-eastern and south-western regions of north america  <cit> . like common beans  which are combined with maize or other starchy staple crops in other parts of the world, dry grain cowpea is consumed with lower protein cereal and root/tuber staples to provide an adequate protein quantity and quality to hundreds of millions of rural and urban consumers in west africa  <cit> . cowpea forage is used for livestock and cowpea hay plays a critical role as fodder during the dry season in west africa  <cit> . 'longbean' or 'asparagus bean' of cowpea cultivar group sesquipedialis is considered one of the top-ten asian vegetable crops and is grown on at least  <dig>  hectares worldwide for production of fresh 'green' or 'snap' beans.

cowpea  with genome size ~ <dig> mb belongs to the genus vigna savi.  in the phaseoleae  <cit> . genomic resources such as cdna libraries, ests and bac libraries have been meagre in cowpea  <cit>  until very recently. high-resolution genetic maps provide breeders the ability to analyze the inheritance of genes of interest, monitor the transmission of specific genes or genomic regions from parents to progeny, and accelerate map-based cloning  <cit> . however, relatively few genetic resources are available to cowpea breeders, and molecular marker-based selection is only possible for a few traits  <cit> . efforts made previously for linkage mapping in cowpea include  <dig> rflp markers  <cit> ,  <dig> markers that are mostly rapds  <cit> , and  <dig> markers that are mostly amplified fragment length polymorphisms  together with  <dig> biological resistance traits and resistance gene analogs  <cit> . currently available genetic maps for cowpea are of limited utility for breeders due to the lack of markers tightly linked to important traits such as root-knot nematode resistance  <cit> .

any marker system with increased throughput, decreased cost per data-point, and greater map resolution is highly desirable  <cit>  for genetic mapping and marker assisted breeding. oligonucleotide-based microarrays have been used in recent years to identify genetic polymorphisms  <cit> . winzeler et al.  <cit>  first reported the hybridization of labelled genomic dna to oligonucleotide microarrays to identify sequence polymorphisms in haploid yeast. borevitz et al.  <cit>  coined the term "single feature polymorphism" and demonstrated that this approach can be applied to organisms with somewhat larger genomes, specifically arabidopsis thaliana with a genome size of  <dig> mb. similarly, whole-genome dna-based sfp detection has been accomplished in rice  <cit> , which has a genome size of  <dig> mb, though with a higher false discovery rate, as will be discussed later. for barley, which has a  <dig> mb genome composed of more than 90% repetitive dna, cui et al.  <cit>  and rostoks et al.  <cit>  hybridized the affymetrix barley <dig> expression microarray with rna-derived crna to reduce the target complexity, enabling detection of some thousands of sfps. array-based genotyping by hybridizing with crna instead of dna was initially accomplished in yeast  <cit> , and subsequently in arabidopsis  <cit>  following the work cited above in barley. sfps have been used for genome-wide association mapping and linkage disequilibrium studies  <cit> , and to estimate mutation and recombination parameters in populations  <cit> . thus sfps have become an attractive marker system for various applications including parental polymorphism discovery, which is the present subject of our work on cowpea.

cowpea has been identified as an "orphan crop" recommended for increased support for biotechnology research  <cit> . there are many opportunities to apply knowledge from "model species" such as arabidopsis, rice , and medicago truncatula to crops like cowpea. relatively large genetic gains can be expected from investments in applied plant breeding in cowpea  <cit> .

sfp's based on expressed sequences are an efficient source of large number of genic markers in cowpea relative to moderate-throughput and usually non-genic marker systems such as rapds, aflps and ssrs. here we show that the affymetrix soybean genome array is a satisfactory system for sfp discovery in cowpea, which belongs to the same family as soybean. from this observation, we claim that sfps can also be identified efficiently for other "orphan" legumes using existing genome arrays for soybean or medicago truncatula.

RESULTS
cross species platform for array hybridization
when cowpea crnas were hybridized to the soybean genome array, the frequency of "present" calls ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> % of all probe sets on the array . this is a frequency of  <dig> to  <dig> % of probe sets specific to soybean  since only 61% of the probe sets target soybean genes .

sfp detection and validation
robustified projection pursuit   <cit>  was used for sfp detection between two parental genotypes  of a ril population segregating for several important agronomic traits. as stated in methods, rpp provides a list of sfp probe sets and single probes positioned directly over genetic polymorphisms. because the rpp method depends on the availability of "present" calls in both of the comparison genotypes, and because only about 20% of the probe sets are called "present" using cowpea rna, only about  <dig>  of the  <dig>  soybean probe sets have the potential to detect sfps in cowpea from typical cowpea rna samples. using a top 15% outlying score cut-off, we generated a list of  <dig> putative sfp probes between genotypes cb <dig> and it93k-503- <dig>  a full list of these sfps and their outlying scores is provided in additional file  <dig>  the question then was, "do these statistically detected sfps represent real genetic polymorphisms in cowpea?"

a schematic diagram of sfp detection and validation is given in figure  <dig>  plots of the log intensities, affinity differences and individual outlying scores for a representative probe set  under both drought-stress and non-stress conditions are shown in figure  <dig>  the intensity differentiation is highest at probe  <dig> between cb <dig> and it93k-503- <dig>  indicating polymorphism at this probe position  <cit> . probe  <dig> was selected as the best sfp probe by the rpp method based on having the highest outlying score.

pcr and gel electrophoresis
a list of primers used and the expected and observed pcr amplicon sizes are provided in table  <dig>  pcr amplicon sizes ranged from  <dig> â€“  <dig> bp. a representative gel image of pcr amplification is shown in figure  <dig>  for the nine primer pairs , the amplicon sizes were as predicted by primer <dig> , the primer designing software. for primer pair gs  <dig>  non specific bands were detected in both genotypes. for this primer pair the 'tm' was increased during pcr but still no specific band of the predicted size was amplified. primer pairs yielding such anomalies, or which yielded no amplicon from one or both cowpea genotypes , were not pursued with amplicon sequencing. for calculation of the validation rate, the numerator is the number of amplicons containing a polymorphism within the region spanned by a sfp probe, and the denominator is the number of amplicons from which sequences were generated.

*predicted size indicates the pcr product size anticipated by the primer <dig> program.

#observed size indicates size of amplicon sequences after assembling the bidirectional sequence reads.

alignment of amplicon sequences for sfp validation
to estimate the sfp validation rate we selected  <dig> putative sfp probe sets. a total of  <dig>  of these  <dig> sfp probe sets were validated by amplicon sequences. a representative alignment of genomic amplicon sequences with the target sequence of probe set gma. <dig> .s1_at is shown in figure  <dig>  probe position  <dig> spans a polymorphism , as predicted by the rpp method. alignments of the  <dig> validated sfp probes from the  <dig> validated probe sets  are shown in figure  <dig>  among these  <dig> validated sfp probes,  <dig> sfp  were positioned over a single snp,  <dig>  were positioned over only a single nucleotide insertion or deletion ,  <dig>  spanned one snp and one single nucleotide indel,  <dig>  spanned two snps, and  <dig>  spanned two snps and a dinucleotide indel.

discussion
array-based genotyping
the availability of arrays designed to measure gene expression for a wide range of species has spawned considerable interest in identifying single feature polymorphisms  from dna hybridization and transcriptome data  <cit> . sfps derived from transcript sequences provide a link to structural genes and are particularly attractive for species which lack sequence resources for marker development. the rpp method  <cit>  is distinct from several commonly used statistical approaches to sfp identification  <cit>  in that the rpp method does not accept expression level polymorphisms, which may be attributed to linked cis-acting regulatory regions or to unlinked trans-acting factors. instead, rpp limits its sfp calls to those that are most likely to be positioned over a genetic polymorphism. this maximizes the relationship between the probe set functional annotation and the gene containing the detected polymorphism, which consequently maximizes the potential for cross-species synteny mapping using sfps. a simplification of the rpp method has been used for  <dig>  mb hexaploid wheat to map markers termed "high variance probe sets" to delimit the positions of translocation breakpoints using wheat-rice synteny  <cit> . here we report cross species application of the affymetrix soybean genome array by rpp for polymorphism identification in parents of a cowpea recombinant inbred line mapping population.

the false positive rate in sfp detection is an important consideration for application of sfps to genetic mapping. the false positive rate is essentially the percentage of statistically defined sfps that are not valid at the dna sequence level. ideally, the false positive rate would be 100% minus the validation rate from amplicon sequencing. however, for cowpea and other species which lack complete genome sequence information, incomplete knowledge of genes, and gene families in particular, limits the validation rate to a theoretical maximum less than 100%. this is because pcr primers for amplicon production must be designed only from known sequences and therefore cannot always target the same gene detected by a sfp probe. amplification of the wrong member of a gene family bearing no polymorphism can result in a false non-validation of a sfp . we had access to sequences of less than 70% of all cowpea expressed genes, and therefore also to less than 70% of the members of any given multigene family. this absence of sequence information would tend to cause an overestimation of the false positive rate. however, the selection of sfp probe sets for validation was somewhat skewed toward sfps with higher outlying scores, which may cause an overestimation of the validation rate. therefore, the estimated 68% validation rate and inferred 32% false positive are only rough estimates. we have observed that at least 50% of the non-validated cowpea sfps are in genes that are multi-gene family members. an extreme case of multigene families comes from a study of medicago truncatula nodules, which revealed the ncr  gene family with more than  <dig> members  <cit> .

a false positive rate of about 5% in sfp detection was reported in yeast  <cit>  and 3% in arabidopsis  <cit>  using genomic dna. in contrast, approximately a 25% false positive rate was reported in  <dig> mb rice using genomic dna  <cit> , and 10â€“20% in  <dig> mb barley using rna-based datasets and rpp  <cit> .

cross-species platform for orphan crops/organisms
recently a number of interspecies comparisons of gene expression have been carried out including human versus monkeys  <cit> , between rodents  <cit> , human versus mouse  <cit> , within xenopus  <cit>  and within drosophila  <cit> . cross-species analysis of gene expression in non-model mammals was reported by nieto-dÃ­az et al.  <cit> . the reproducibility of probe data obtained from hybridizing deer, old-world primates, and human rna samples to the affymetrix human genechipÂ® u <dig> plus  <dig>  was compared. cross-species hybridization affected neither the distribution of the hybridization reproducibility among different categories nor the reproducibility values of the individual probes. studies such as these encouraged us to extend the cross-species concept to sfp detection for cowpea using the readily available affymetrix soybean genome array.

in the sfp validation process we identified polymorphic sites including snps and indels in sequences neighbouring the sfp probe positions. such polymorphisms, which generally represent haplotypes, also can be used for mapping and therefore are useful by-products of genomic amplicon sequencing for sfp validation. as shown in figure  <dig>  there are even instances of amplicon sequence polymorphisms when no polymorphism is detected in an sfp position. in general cowpea seems to have abundant genetic polymorphism.

cost of array-based genotyping
the costs of marker development and application are important to consider. at our cost of $ <dig> per soybean genome array for purchase, labelling, hybridization and data collection, the array-related costs of genotyping  <dig> rils from two cowpea genotypes using one array per ril would be $ <dig>  usd. if this would yield  <dig> mapped sfp markers, then this would amount to $ <dig> usd per mapped marker. depending on the circumstances, this may or may not be attractive relative to other marker options, and array costs may vary at different locations. nevertheless, $ <dig> usd per mapped sfp in a 100-ril population may be useful as an approximate point of reference. alternatively, using rpp one could readily generate a short list of sfp-bearing probe sets using datasets derived just from parental genotypes and then develop smaller, less expensive arrays containing only the probe sets that contain sfps, reducing the cost per mapped sfp accordingly.

another possible application of cross-species sfp analysis would be simply to compare any two genotypes within a species in order to focus amplicon sequence-based marker development on a set of target sequences that have a high chance of revealing a polymorphism. a modest expenditure to produce two datasets from each genotype of interest could provide a sizeable cost savings in materials and labour by increasing the success rate of amplicon sequencing in search of polymorphisms.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the affymetrix soybean genome array is a satisfactory platform for identification of sfps in cowpea. this study demonstrated an efficient way to generate genetic sfp markers for orphan crops by using the two parents of a ril population segregating for several important agronomic traits. sfps between these two genotypes can be used for high density mapping and those which are tightly linked to phenotypes such as drought or insect tolerance could be used for marker-assisted breeding.
