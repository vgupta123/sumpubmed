BACKGROUND
low density lipoprotein  is oxidized in vascular endothelial cells to oxldl, a highly detrimental product that results in endothelial cell injury and is implicated in the development of atherosclerosis. vascular endothelial cells also internalize and degrade external oxldl though the lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor- <dig>   <cit> . oxldl causes vascular endothelial cell activation and dysfunction, resulting in pro-inflammatory responses, pro-oxidative conditions, and apoptosis, all of which are pro-atherogenic. lox- <dig> has been characterized as the primary receptor for oxldl on the surface of vascular endothelial cells and is up-regulated in atherosclerotic lesions  <cit> . upon recognition of oxldl, lox- <dig> is observed to initiate oxldl internalization and degradation as well as the induction of a variety of pro-atherogenic cellular responses, including reduction of nitric oxide  release  <cit> , secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein- <dig>   <cit> , production of reactive oxygen species  <cit> , expression of matrix metalloproteinase- <dig> and - <dig>  <cit> , monocyte adhesion  <cit> , and apoptosis  <cit> .

lox- <dig> is a member of the scavenger receptor family, a structurally diverse group of cell surface receptors of the innate immune system that recognize modified lipoproteins. it is a disulfide-linked homodimeric type ii transmembrane protein with a short 34-residue cytoplasmic region, a single transmembrane region, and an extracellular region consisting of an 80-residue domain, predicted to be a coiled coil called "neck domain", followed by a 130-residue c-terminal c-type lectin-like domain   <cit> .

the crystal structure of the human lox- <dig> ctld has recently been determined  <cit> . human lox- <dig> ctld forms a heart-shaped homodimer , with a tunnel running through the center of the molecule. the lox- <dig> monomer has a typical ctld fold  <cit>  consisting of two antiparallel β-sheets, β0-β1-β5-β1a and β2a-β2-β3-β4-β2b, flanked by two α-helices, α <dig> and α <dig>   <cit> . three large loops, protruding into the solvent, are included in the second β-sheet: l <dig> from β <dig> to β2a, l <dig> from β2a to β2b and l <dig> from β2b to β <dig>  <cit> . the fold is further stabilized by three conserved intra-chain disulfide bonds . a cysteine in position  <dig>  present only in human lox- <dig>  forms an inter-chain disulfide between the monomers at the n-terminus of the ctld  <cit> . deletion analysis has localized oxldl recognition to the highly conserved  ctld of lox- <dig>  <cit> .

several positively charged ctld lox- <dig> residues are known to play a role in the recognition of oxldl  <cit> , and a detailed understanding of this interaction could be of significant medical interest because specific antagonists potentially could mitigate the progression of atherosclerosis. in vivo functional assays with lox- <dig> mutants revealed that linearly aligned basic residues at the dimer surface, that has been referred as the basic spine , are responsible for ligand binding  <cit> . in fact single elimination of each arginine reduces the binding activity. this effect is even more evident upon mutation of trp <dig>  a residue located at the dimer interface, into alanine, suggesting that an altered inter-subunit interaction strongly affect the oxldl binding region  <cit> . oxldl has been suggested to have amphipathic α-helices on its surface  <cit> , and the basic spine structure of lox- <dig> has been proposed to provide an appropriate platform for the interaction with these α-helices  <cit> .

in this work we have investigated the not naturally occurring lox- <dig> trp150ala mutation through molecular dynamics  simulation to study its structural and dynamical properties in comparison to the wild-type protein  <cit> . our results show that both the native and mutated proteins have a stable dimeric structure, but they display different overall motion. in the native protein a collective motion generates a symmetrical rotation of each monomer one against the other, while in the mutant this coordinated inter-subunit movement is absent. as a consequence an altered dynamical coupling of the monomers and different fluctuations of the basic spine residues are observed, providing an explanation for the drastic reduction of the oxldl binding affinity of the mutant protein.

RESULTS
root mean square deviations and fluctuations
the main chain root mean square deviations  were calculated, for the trajectories of the two proteins, from the starting structures as a function of time . although the rmsds reach a stable value within the first nanosecond all the analyses have been carried out discarding the first three nanoseconds, i.e. over the last seven nanoseconds. this was done to guarantee an investigation over a well thermalized system. time evolution of the number of residues in α-helix, β-strand and random coil secondary structures, gyration radius, total solvent accessible surface area  and rmsd , all confirm the protein stability over the entire trajectory chosen for the analysis.

the main chain root mean square fluctuations  calculated over the trajectories and averaged over each residue for the wild-type and the trp150ala , indicate that a large part of residues is characterized by fluctuations not higher than  <dig>  Å, apart from the random coil regions of the c-terminal tails which reach values around  <dig>  Å. the n-terminal tails are less flexible due to the presence of the inter-subunit disulfide bridge  and do not exceed  <dig>  Å. a relatively highly fluctuating region in both proteins  is localized between arg <dig> and gly <dig>  including the loops l <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig> and the two small β-strands β2a and β2b.

the two proteins display a similar fluctuation pattern, although important differences are observed for two  of the four residues  belonging to the basic spine. in the two subunits of the wild-type the average fluctuation of arg <dig> is very similar . on the contrary in the mutant this residue is more fluctuating in the first subunit . a fluctuation difference is observed also for arg <dig> that shows a value of  <dig>  Å in the two subunits of the wild-type, while it is less fluctuating in the first subunit of the mutant  .

for the native protein the residue rmsf values reproduce well the crystallographic b-factors  <cit>  . this is strictly true for the helices and the β-strands, while the loops between regular secondary structures segments have fluctuations larger than the corresponding converted b-factors, likely due to the higher degree of hydration of the simulations when compared to the crystal  <cit> . the b-factor values of basic spine arginines, extracted from the pdb file 1ypq <cit>  and converted to rmsf values for comparison , are very close to the residue rmsf values detected in the wild-type simulation .

secondary structures and cavities
the analysis of the secondary structures, carried out with the program dssp  <cit> , indicates that the two proteins have comparable secondary structure regions . as shown in fig.  <dig>  a difference is observed only at the level of strand β <dig>  involved in the inter-subunit contact. the structure of this β-strand is completely lost in one subunit of the mutant.

two large cavities are present in the lox- <dig> ctld. the first cavity is represented by the "hydrophobic tunnel", which is a  <dig> Å, mostly non-polar, tunnel localized at the center of the dimer interface  <cit> . this tunnel is 7– <dig> Å in diameter except for a constriction that narrows the middle of the tunnel to a diameter of  <dig> Å  <cit> . the second cavity, located below the first one and above the inter-chain cys <dig> a-cys <dig> b disulfide bridge, is smaller and shaped by hydrophobic residues including pro <dig>  cys <dig>  pro <dig>  trp <dig>  ile <dig> and trp <dig>  <cit> . in the mutant protein the amino acid substitution trp150ala generates a volume increase of the second cavity . the volume of the two cavities, monitored along the trajectories of the two proteins by using the program surfnet  <cit> , is preserved in both simulations.

hydrogen bond analysis
the lox- <dig> dimer structure shows that trp <dig> contributes not only to dimer formation but also to the maintenance of the proper ctld fold through inter and intra-chain hydrogen bonds  <cit> . in the wild-type simulation, the maintenance of the short β0-β <dig> antiparallel β-ribbon is ensured by hydrogen bond network between trp <dig> nε1-gly <dig> o, asp <dig> n-trp <dig> o and his <dig> n-asn <dig> o.

in the mutant protein the introduction of an alanine in position  <dig> disrupts the hydrogen bond between the indole group and gly <dig> in both subunits and prevents, in the b subunit, the hydrogen bond between his <dig> and asn <dig>  thereby generating the asymmetric unfolding of the β <dig> segment . however, new inter-subunit hydrogen bonds arise between gln <dig> nε2-ala <dig> o and ala <dig> n-trp <dig> o enforcing the dimeric interactions.

cross-correlations and principal component analysis
interesting results concerning the relative flexibility and communication of the two proteins can be obtained by looking at the correlated motion between different regions of the protein as described by the dynamic cross correlation  map calculated on the cα atoms  <cit> . such plots are reported in fig.  <dig>  where a black spot represents a correlation between two cα greater than  <dig>  in absolute value. the panels indicate that both the native  and the mutant lox- <dig>  have a low degree of correlation. the native protein displays a symmetric behaviour, with the correlation maps being almost identical for the two subunits . in particular, in the wild-type protein the correlation spots present in the two subunits involve the segment including strand β <dig>  helix α <dig> and strand β1a that is correlated with strand β5; strand β <dig> that is correlated with strand β <dig> and β5; and strand β2b that is correlated with strand β <dig>  in contrast the symmetric correlation is lost in the mutant. in this case the maps of the two subunits are different , and an higher degree of correlations is observed between residues adjacent along the sequence  when compared to the wild-type.

the principal component analysis , or essential dynamics  <cit> , has been also applied to highlight the correlation differences between the native and mutated protein. this analysis is based on the diagonalisation of the covariance matrix built from the atomic fluctuations after the removal of the translational and rotational movement, and permits the identification of the main 3n directions along which the majority of the protein motion is defined. the analysis, carried out on the  <dig> cα atoms of the two proteins, indicates that although the motion is dispersed over  <dig> eigenvectors, about 80% of the motion depends on the first  <dig> eigenvectors having the largest eigenvalues  as generally found in many different systems  <cit> .

dynamical differences between the wild-type and mutant proteins can be appreciated looking at the cα projections of the md motions along the first eigenvector, which contain about 20% of the total motion . the projections of the motion are shown in fig.  <dig>  the width of the ribbon indicates the amplitude of the backbone motion whilst the direction, evidenced by the arrows, goes from the red to the blue colour. wild-type lox- <dig>  shows a symmetrical and uniform rotation of each monomer one against the other, the hinge of this motion being represented by a flexible subunit interface .

in mutant lox- <dig>  the coupling of the inter-subunit motion is cancelled by the mutation that generates a rigid subunit interface and strongly restrains the synchronized motion observed in the wild-type protein. the unique regions having a relative high mobility are now represented by the loops l <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig> and the amino and carboxy terminal tails that release the motion gathered by the dimeric structure in the absence of a bendable interface hinge . the different motion induces a different behaviour of the residues belonging to the four basic spine arginines of the two subunits, represented by van der waals spheres in fig.  <dig>  the arginines, in fact, move in an opposite direction in the two proteins, as indicated by the reverse position of their blue and red colours.

our analyses indicate that the mutant displays a different dynamical coupling of the monomers, when compared to the native protein, and a different fluctuations of the basic spine arginines, two factors that may prevent the molecular recognition of oxldl.

CONCLUSIONS
the results obtained from molecular dynamics simulations indicate that both the native and the trp150ala mutated protein display a stable dimeric structure that is fully maintained over the entire simulation time. in fact, elimination of the trp <dig>  located at the inter-subunit interface, mainly induces a dynamical perturbation and only in part a structural rearrangement.

the first important dynamical effect is the occurrence of a different flexibility of two of the four arginine residues , which belong to the basic spine . these display high flexibility only in one of the two subunits of the trp150ala mutant. this asymmetric dynamical behaviour is coupled to the asymmetric destructuration of the β <dig> strand that occurs only in a single subunit of the mutant . this is due to the alteration of the hydrogen bond network that, instead, is fully maintained in the native protein. the loss of this short β-strand, located at the dimer interface, damps the dimer symmetric motion present in the wild-type as detected through the pca analysis . the two monomers in the wild-type undergo a symmetric rotation that pushes the monomers one against the other, using the inter-subunit surface as a flexible hinge . on the other hand, in the mutant the inter-subunit surface becomes rigid and the two monomers do not move anymore in a symmetric way . this alteration of basic spine dynamical properties disengages the molecular recognition, indicating that the oxldl needs a regular motion of the monomers for its efficient binding on the receptor surface.

because the lox- <dig> receptor plays a crucial role in atherosclerosis plaque formation, unravelling the molecular mechanism of oxldl-lox- <dig> interaction is of clinical interest. to understand the dynamical aspects of the recognition site could very well be the first step towards the development and therapeutical application of oxldl antagonists.
