BACKGROUND
phialocephala fortinii s.l., an anamorphic ascomycete  <cit>  belonging to the helotiales  <cit> , has been identified as an ubiquitous colonizer of woody plant roots colonizing up to 90% of the roots of woody plant species  <cit> . the geographical distribution of pac species ranges from polar regions  <cit> , over temperate regions  <cit> , to subtropical regions  <cit> . phialocephala fortinii s.l. was shown to be composed of at least  <dig> reproductively isolated lineages, eight of which were formally described  <cit> . in addition, a closely related but sterile species also colonizing roots of woody plant species endophytically was described as acephala applanata <cit> . these species are also known as phialocephala fortinii s.l. – acephala applanata species complex . pac species form communities of up to  <dig> sympatrically occurring species and communities were shown to remain stable for several years  <cit> . no distance-decay relationship was observed among pac communities collected across the northern hemisphere and therefore the baas-becking hypothesis that “everything is everywhere” could not be rejected for this assemblage of species  <cit> . although sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer  regions of the rdna is often regarded as a ‘gold standard’ in species diagnosis in fungi  <cit> , the resolution of its sequences was not sufficient to differentiate species in this complex  <cit> . instead, several classes of molecular markers were developed for pac species assignment including pcr fingerprinting, single-copy restriction fragment length polymorphisms , multilocus sequence typing, and microsatellites. although each of these molecular markers supported the delineation of multiple species in this complex, with concordant cryptic species defined by all markers  <cit> , the application of these markers is laborious. in addition, introgression or incomplete lineage sorting further complicates species diagnosis in this species complex  <cit> . a single, short sequence that allows unequivocally diagnosing pac species, and if possible other closely related taxa, is still missing.

mitochondrial  markers were successfully applied in evolutionary biology and systematics  <cit>  because mt genomes often evolve faster than the nuclear genomes especially in intergenic regions  <cit> . the mt genomes of filamentous ascomycetes range between  <dig> to over 100 kb and have a circular topology. they usually contain  <dig> mt genes encoding proteins of the oxidative phosphorylation system , the large  and small  ribosomal subunits, and a varying set of trnas genes  <cit> . in addition, a varying number group i and group ii introns specific to fungal mt genomes often including giy-yig or laglidagd endonucleases were reported  <cit>  and several open reading frames with unknown functions were described  <cit> . in pezizomycotina, completely sequenced and annotated mt genomes are available for members of the eurotiomycetes and sordariomycetes but only partial non-annotated genomes or draft annotations are available for helotialean species. the helotiales is one of the most diverse fungal orders and is comprised of more than  <dig> genera including over  <dig>  described species including many important plant pathogens  <cit> .

in the course of a genome sequencing project of p. subalpina a draft sequence of the mt genome became available. we used this draft sequence and re-sequenced the complete mt genome of p. subalpina. specifically we aimed to:  present a completely sequenced and annotated mt genome for the helotialean branch of the fungal tree of life,  compare gene orders of p. subalpina with those found in other filamentous ascomycetes,  compare the evolution of mt and nuclear genomes in pac species and,  test mt loci as a tool for species diagnosis in pac.

RESULTS
genome content and genome organization
the circular mt genome of p. subalpina strain uamh  <dig> is  <dig>  bp long  with an at-content of 72% and contains  <dig> open reading frames,  <dig> of which code for oxphos proteins . all  <dig> protein-coding orfs are transcribed in the same direction and start with the canonical translation initiation codon atg except cox <dig>  and cox <dig> . the preferred stop codon was taa with the exception of nad <dig> and nad <dig> . beside the  <dig> oxphos genes, the ribosomal protein s <dig>  and a giy-yig endonuclease were recognized. in addition, a putative n-acetyl-transferase with an acetyltransf_ <dig> domain at the c-terminus was predicted . blastp searches returned several hits for acetylase_ <dig> containing proteins in other ascomycetes. however, all of these proteins were located in the nuclear genome. similarly, tblastn searches of the putative mt n-acetyl-transferase against a draft genome sequence of p. subalpina recognized two additional n-acetyl-transferases for p. subalpina but both nuclear proteins were substantially smaller  than the predicted mt protein . the functions of the remaining four orfs are unknown because neither significant blastp hits nor conserved domains in interproscan searches were found. in addition, the large and small ribosomal rna subunits  were present in the mt genome. a number of  <dig>  roche/ <dig> gs flx  est sequencing reads  mapped to the mt genome. reads almost exclusively mapped to coding regions of the mt genome  and all orfs except orf_ <dig> were partially or fully covered by ests. however, sequence coverage differed considerably among genes .

in total,  <dig> trna genes coding for all amino acids were predicted in the mt genome. both software tools applied resulted in the same trna predictions except trna-cys at position  <dig> , which was only predicted by rnaweasel and trna-asn at position  <dig>  that was exclusively predicted by trnascan-se. a putative ochre suppressor trna gene  was predicted by trnascan-se. protein-coding genes covered  <dig> % of the mt genome, while  <dig> % and  <dig> % correspond to trna genes and rrna genes, respectively .

duplication of a region including the atp <dig> open reading frame in pac
a duplication of an mtdna region including the atp <dig> open reading frame was observed in p. subalpina . beside the atp <dig> orf , the duplication included 124 bp upstream of the start codon and 37 bp downstream of the stop codon of the atp <dig> orf . the duplication was interrupted by a 488 bp insertion . the putative orf_ <dig>  shared the first 14 bp of the duplicated atp <dig> orf but the remaining 358 bp of orf_ <dig> including the stop codon lie in the 488 bp insertion interrupting the duplication .

analysis of the cox1nad <dig> region for seven additional pac strains  showed that the synteny between orf_ <dig> and nad <dig> was conserved among all pac species and sequence identity was > 90%. in contrast, it was not possible to derive significant alignments based on nucleotide data for all  <dig> species between cox <dig> and orf_ <dig>  two groups were recognized that produced significant alignments over the entire cox1nad <dig> sequences . whereas the first group is comprised of p. turicensisp. letziip europaea and a. applanata, the second group included p. helveticap. uotolensisp. subalpina and p. fortinii s.s. the differences between cox <dig> and orf_ <dig> for the two groups are also reflected by the annotation of different gene features between these two groups. species in group  <dig> possess an additional trna-cys between cox <dig> and orf_ <dig> except for a. applanata and no insert was observed in the duplicated region including the atp <dig> orf. the trna-cys was not recognized by rnaweasel in a. applanata due to the accumulation of mutations in this particular region compared to the other species of group  <dig>  in contrast, members of group  <dig> possess a trna-ser between orf_ <dig> and orf_ <dig>  which was, however, not present in p. helvetica due to a 118 bp deletion . in addition, p. helvetica deviated from other group  <dig> species by the absence of the 488 bp insertion leading to the annotation of orf_ <dig>  genome organisation between cox <dig> and nad <dig> reflected the known phylogenetic relatedness of pac species with the exception of p. uotolensis. strain 5_134_ <dig> of p. uotolensis, which is closely related to p. turicensis based on sequences of several nuclear loci, single-copy rflp analysis and microsatellite data  <cit> , showed a similar genome organization as p. fortinii s.s. and p. subalpina.

the presence of a duplication of the region including the atp <dig> orf could be confirmed for all eight genomes at the nucleotide level . three species had two non-interrupted orfs for the atp <dig> gene  with identical protein sequences for p. letzii and p. europaea. the two p. helvetica atp <dig> protein sequences deviate at two of the  <dig> aa positions between the two atp <dig> orfs. all other species have either an insertion leading to orf_ <dig>  or a deletion  in one of the atp <dig> orfs . similarly, a. applanata possessed an insertion of 234 bp in one of the atp <dig> orfs . the insert shows neither direct nor inverted repeats and did not show any similarities with known nucleotide or protein sequences using blastn and blastx searches.

conservation of putative orfs in pac species
in order to collect further evidence that putative orfs code for proteins, the conservation of these orfs was investigated in seven additional pac species. unfortunately, repeated attempts to amplify the region of orf_ <dig> failed. in contrast, we could assess the presence and conservation of the other  <dig> putative orfs observed in p. subalpina in the additional pac species. orf_ <dig> was observed in all eight pac species. despite snps and indels, none of the indels resulted in frameshift mutations and no premature stop codons were present . in contrast, orf_ <dig> was either missing completely, contained stop codons, or the start codon was missing in five of the eight species. similarly, orf_ <dig> was only present in three of the eight species and p. fortinii s.s. had a premature stop codon .

evolution of gene orders in the helotiales and pezizomycotina
anchored genome alignments for the three helotialean species p. subalpina, s. sclerotiorum and b. cinerea show pronounced genome rearrangements between p. subalpina and the closely related species s. sclerotiorum and b. cinerea . in contrast, complete synteny in gene order were evident between s. sclerotiorum and b. cinerea. phylogenetic analysis based on  <dig> oxphos protein sequences  allowed for the identification of the four classes of filamentous ascomycetes . although the ml tree shows that the dothideomycetes and leotiomycetes share a most recent common ancestor with the eurotiomycetes, the bs support value  and bayesian pp value  for this placement are low. therefore, alternative hypotheses such as dothideomycetes and leotiomycetes sharing a most recent common ancestor with the sordariomycetes cannot be ruled out.

based on this phylogeny, we have reconstructed putative ancestral gene orders and rearrangements leading to the contemporary gene orders of  <dig> oxphos proteins , rps <dig>  and rrnas by using crex and treerex analysis . identical ancestral gene arrangements were observed in treerex analysis irrespective whether the leotiomycetes and dothideomycetes share the most recent common ancestor with the sordariomycetes or the eurotiomycetes . the evolution of gene orders among species belonging to the pezizomycotina was mainly characterized by transpositions . in contrast, inversions and inverse-transpositions have not been found in the analysed gene orders, which excluded the two dothideomycete species. however, the dothideomycetes have genes that are in opposite orientation with respect to the remaining pezizomycotina species. moreover, both species were separated from all other pezizomycotina species and by themselves by very long evolutionary scenarios rendering the reconstruction unreliable . in our analysis, only one tandem-duplication-random-loss  event was suggested by crex analysis involving cob and cox <dig> to derive the gene order of s. sclerotiorum . blastx searches of cob and cox <dig> protein sequences against the mtdna of s. sclerotiorum confirmed that a duplication-based rearrangement mechanism was involved because a partial cob fragment in front of cox <dig> was found as expected for the predicted operation . together with the duplication of atp <dig> for pac species  this indicates that duplication-based rearrangement are involved in mitogenome evolution of pezizomycotina. the number of necessary events required to convert one gene order to the other was not always related to the phylogenetic distance between species. for example, gene orders of podospora anserina and s. sclerotiorum could only be derived from gene orders of their closest relatives by evolutionary scenarios that include multiple transpositions and in the case of s. sclerotiorum a tdrl event.

based on the used species and gene sampling our analysis indicates that i) the group of beauveria bassiana  represent the ancestral gene order for the sordariomycetes, i.e., no gene rearrangements are necessary to reach the node in the phylogenetic tree representing the sordariomycetes. similarly, aspergillus niger  represents the ancestral gene order for the eurotiomycetes. furthermore, comparisons among the possible intermediate gene orders of the sordariomycetes, eurotiomycetes, and the reconstructed ancestral gene order of the leotiomycetes indicates the intermediate position of the later .

evolution of mtdna in pac and searching regions for species diagnosis
a total of  <dig>  bp  from four regions of the mt genome were amplified in four additional pac species to screen for polymorphisms . fragments included coding  and intergenic regions . high amounts of dna polymorphisms were observed within coding and intergenic regions among pac species . however, dna polymorphisms were not always evenly distributed among species within the sequenced dna fragments. whereas in three cases all five species contributed to a similar extent to the observed polymorphic regions , p. europaea was almost exclusively responsible for a peak in diversity observed in cox <dig> . in addition, a 520 bp indel in the non-coding region spanning rps <dig> and the putative n-acetyl-transferase showed a very high nucleotide diversity among the three species with this insert  . based on these results three regions were selected and tested on a broader selection of strains. parts of rnl , a fragment located between rps <dig> and the putative n-acetyl-transferase , and a fragment including parts of nad <dig> and nad <dig>  were sequenced from  <dig> strains belonging to eight pac species . best-fitting mutation models selected from jmodeltest were f81 + i, tvm + g, trn + g, and tpm3uf + i + g for the three individual loci and the concatenated dataset, respectively. variation in the three fragments was considerable among and within species. often single strains of a species were responsible for this high variation found within species . for example, strains 7_45_ <dig>  or t1_k92_ <dig> were separated from the other strains of the respective species for all three loci resulting in  <dig> and  <dig> substitutions respectively, not considering indels. p. turicensis was the only species that was monomorphic for all three loci. ml and bi analysis using the concatenated dataset placed strains of each species in well-supported clades . in addition, the tree topology of each individual mtdna locus and the concatenated mtdna dataset did not deviate significantly from the topology of the concatenated sequences of four genomic regions sequenced previously  <cit>  . no evidence for recombination blocks among the three sequenced loci were found, although incompatible sites were regularly observed . incompatible sites were located within as well as between the three sequenced loci.

discussion
in the present study we sequenced and annotated the mt genome of a widely distributed group of root-inhabiting fungi belonging to the helotiales . gene order analysis showed that the evolution of mt genomes in the pezizomycotina is mainly driven by transpositions. moreover, we show the usefulness of mtdna loci for species diagnosis in the phialocephala fortinii s.l. – acephala applanata species complex .

gene content and mt organisation in p. subalpina
the mt genome of filamentous ascomycetes normally code for  <dig> proteins of the oxidative phosphorylation system  <cit> , including the sequences for the large  and small  ribosomal subunits. in addition, a varying number of additional proteins with homologies to known proteins, i.e., the ribosomal protein s <dig>   <cit> , and orfs with unknown functions may be found  <cit> . the mt genome of p. subalpina follows this rule. all  <dig> oxphos proteins, the two rrnas and a complete set of trna genes were present. nevertheless, some unique features were observed.  a putative n-acetyl-transferase was predicted in the mt genome. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a putative n-acetyl-transferase in the mt genome of ascomycetes. acetyl-transferases modify proteins in eukaryotes, both co- and post-translationally by transferring acetyl groups from acetyl-coenzyme a to either the a-amino group of amino-terminal residues or to the e-amino group of lysine residues at various positions  <cit> . in addition, n-acetyl-transferases were shown to modify several ribosomal proteins in escherichia coli <cit> . although it seems likely that the putative mt n-acetyl-transferase is involved in protein modifications, the exact function is unknown because n-acetyl-transferases can act on different groups of substrates  <cit> .  the ribosomal protein s <dig>  formed a free-standing orf in p. subalpina . to the best of our knowledge this is the second report of a free-standing rps <dig> gene in the pezizomycotina. in all completely sequenced mt genomes of filamentous ascomycetes possessing rps <dig>  this gene is placed in a group-i intron located in the u <dig> domain of the rnl except for phaeospaeria nodorum <cit> . whereas the rps <dig> of p. nodorum is large  and includes parts of cox <dig> <cit> , rps <dig> found in p. subalpina is similar in length as rps <dig> found in s. sclerotiorum and other ascomycetes. in addition, blastp searches revealed no segments of other mt proteins. rps <dig> followed cox <dig> in both species and sequencing of additional mt genomes in the dothideomycetes and leotiomycetes will show whether cox2rps <dig> synteny may be another common position of rps <dig> in mt genomes.  an ochre suppressor trna gene was predicted. suppressor trnas were found in the genomes of many species and allow the read-through of stop codons  <cit> . they provide a regulatory mechanism of gene expression allowing the production of several proteins from a single gene and were shown to be especially important for rna viruses  <cit> . moreover, suppressor trnas are hypothesized to play a role for the transcription of cryptic mitochondrial gene on the antisense strand  <cit> .  a duplication of a genomic region including the atp <dig> open reading frame interrupted by a 488 bp insert was observed in p. subalpina, leading to the annotation of orf_ <dig>  re-sequencing of the cox1-orf_01-orf_02-atp9-nad <dig> region for additional seven pac species confirmed that three species have two intact orfs coding for atp <dig>  in all other species one of the two atp <dig> orfs was interrupted by indels indicating that the duplication of the atp <dig> region followed by successive modifications predated the separation of pac species. interestingly, two types of sequences with no obvious similarity were found between cox <dig> and the duplicated atp <dig> regions for pac species, which was reflected in the annotated gene features and was in accordance with the relatedness of the species. an exception was p. uotolensis strain 5_134_ <dig>  which showed a similar sequence and organisation as p. subalpina and p. fortinii s.s. in previous studies we showed for this strain that it might be the result of a hybridization event with p. subalpina. for example the same strain clustered with a p. subalpina strain for the sequence of the translation elongation factor 1-α  <cit>  but three other nuclear loci, microsatellite analysis and single-copy rflp analysis placed this strain with other strains of p. uotolensis <cit> .

transcription of orfs in the mt genome
identification of mtdna genes is no guarantee that they are also active, as was e.g. shown for a silent copy of the cox <dig> gene in the soybean mitochondrion  <cit> . mapping of  <dig> est sequence reads showed that they were mostly restricted to orfs and rdna genes. all orfs except orf_ <dig> were confirmed by ests. however, pronounced differences in the sequence coverage were observed. several factors could explain the differences observed in the transcription profile of coding regions. either the  <dig> sequencing protocol introduced non-uniform coverage in the normalized cdna library  <cit>  or the differences in the coverage reflect some differences in the expression of mt genes. indeed, transcription of mt genes in the ascomycete saccharomyces cerevisiae was shown to be far from uniform  <cit> . future rt-qpcr assays for p. subalpina will show whether the observed differences in cdna coverage reflect differences in expression profiles for mt proteins.

do putative orfs code for proteins?
putative orfs are regularly annotated in fungal genomes  <cit> . however, whether they really code for proteins is rarely assessed. in the present study we used an indirect approach to gain additional evidence whether putative orfs code for proteins. we assume that putative orfs that code for a protein should  be transcribed, i.e., ests should match the respective regions and  nucleotide sequences of the orfs should be conserved among closely related species, in particular premature stop codons and frameshifts should not be detected. orf_ <dig> is an example of a transcribed and conserved orf that most likely codes for a protein although blastp searches recognized no similar proteins in the ncbi database. in contrast, orf_ <dig> was either completely deleted or included premature stop codons in four species and the insert responsible for orf_ <dig> was only present in three species and included a frame-shift mutation in one of these species. therefore, we hypothesize that orf_ <dig> and orf_ <dig> do not code for proteins because they are not universally conserved despite their  transcription . however, definitive evidence that conserved and transcribed orfs code for proteins is only given when the corresponding proteins are isolated  <cit> .

evolution of gene orders in filamentous ascomycetes
phylogenetic analysis based on protein data of  <dig> oxphos genes resulted in a robust phylogeny with the exception of the dothideomycetes and leotiomycetes which clustered together, but their position was not resolved and it remained unclear whether they share the most common ancestor with the sordariomycetes or the eurotiomycetes. indeed, several deep phylogenetic analysis based on nuclear genes and/or rdna loci placed the leotiomycetes in a cluster with the sordariomycetes  <cit> . to attribute for the uncertainty of the placement of leotiomycetes, we analyzed the evolution of gene orders using both alternative hypotheses.

gene orders were compared previously for some fungal orders  <cit>  but no automated and formally well-defined approach was used to reconstruct the rearrangement history. crex is based on the notion of common intervals, which reflect genes that appear consecutively in the input gene orders. in addition, we used treerex resulting in a detailed reconstruction of the rearrangement history and our analysis revealed that the evolution of gene orders in filamentous ascomycetes is mainly driven by transposition events and that gene orders are  conserved for close relatives. the conservation of gene orders in close relatives was also shown in previous studies. for example, the transposition leading to the gene order of verticillium dahliae  was confirmed in seven additional verticillium species  <cit> . similarly,  <dig> species closely related to a. niger  were recently shown to have the same gene order as a. niger for the set of genes used in our analysis  <cit> .

gene order analyses were shown to be useful to confirm phylogenetic analysis in several organismal groups  <cit>  and in the present study we show, that the extent of gene rearrangements reflects the phylogenetic position of a species in most cases. for example, the ancestral gene order of the leotiomycetes was most closely related to the two ancestral gene orders of the sordariomycetes and eurotiomycetes based on the parsimonious rearrangement scenarios reconstructed by crex reflecting an intermediate position of the leotiomycetes . this fits well with the results of the phylogenetic analysis showing that the leotiomycetes could share the most recent common ancestor either with the sordariomycetes or the eurotiomycetes. however, two exceptions were observed. first, p. anserina deviated from n. crassa by several transpositions and the loss of the atp <dig> gene. similarly, the two dothideomycete species deviated from themselves and all other pezizomycotina by complex rearrangement scenarios. it was possible to reconstruct the possible ancestral gene order for the sordariomycetes and the eurotiomycetes although the presented results must be regarded as preliminary because of the limited species sampling in particular in the leotiomycetes and the exclusion of the trnas due to restrictions of the software tools used. since trnas are important for understanding the evolution of gene orders  <cit>  the presented results need to be verified with a data set including the trnas.

evolution of mtdna in pac species and suitability of mt markers for species diagnosis
the amount of variation found within pac species was high, despite the fact that strains from most of the species were derived from a single study site . intra-species variability in the mt genome among species belonging to ascomycetes can vary greatly. whereas mtdna was highly diverse in many collections of filamentous ascomycetes  <cit> , low levels of diversity were observed in m. graminicola for a world-wide collection of strains  <cit> . the high amount of variation in pac species could be the result of genetic exchange among mt genomes. although mt genomes were characterized by the absence of any genetic recombination in some studies  <cit>  an increasing number of reports show recombination in mtdna of plants and fungi  <cit> . therefore, we searched for inconsistencies in our dataset to find evidence for recombination events. although inconsistencies were observed among parsimony informative sites for pac species, the inconsistencies occurred within loci as well as between loci and no recombination blocks were evident, indicating that rather parallel mutations than recombination characterize the evolution of the mt genome in pac species.

mt loci were often used as diagnostic markers in systematics. they received particular attention during barcoding campaigns  <cit>  and were also successfully applied for fungal species diagnosis  <cit> . in the present study it was possible to analyze the resolution of mtdna markers at a fine taxonomic level using a well-defined species complex. several marker types were used to characterize cryptic species in pac such as single-copy rflps, microsatellite markers and sequence markers  <cit> . in the present study we show that two of the three examined mtdna regions allow to distinguish all eight pac species. only one strain of p. uotolensis was misplaced using the sequence information of the partial rnl gene. the amount of variation found in three mt loci was high compared to nuclear loci sequenced previously  <cit> . for example, p. letzii and p. europaea have identical sequences for several nuclear coding and non-coding loci and were difficult to diagnose based on single-copy rflp markers  <cit>  but formed well supported monophyletic groups for all mt loci. so far, mating type idiomorphs were the only nuclear regions with a similar ability to distinguish pac species  <cit> . however, a disadvantage of the mating type for species diagnosis is their heterothallic organisation in pac species, which does not allow amplifying a single fragment for all strains. in this respect, mt markers developed in the present study offer advantages and mt loci can be regarded as useful diagnostic markers for pac.

CONCLUSIONS
the availability of the complete annotated mt genome and the knowledge about the intra- and inter-species diversity in pac provides the basis for the development of new markers to study the community ecology, population biology and evolution in this species complex. in addition, it provides a reference for the annotation of other mt genomes in the helotiales.
