BACKGROUND
in the last decades, major technical innovations have allowed a rapid development of various methods for genomic analysis. these have led to applications ranging from phylogeographical reconstructions to forensic analyses and species identification  <cit> . in plants, many studies have focused on the organelle genomes  for six major reasons:  these genomes are usually uniparentally inherited  and thus allow for investigations of gene dispersal by seeds or pollen without recombination effect  <cit> ;  their haploid nature facilitates their sequencing and usually does not require cloning;  such genomes are more prone to stochastic events because their effective population size is half that of diploid genomes, allowing a more accurate detection of evolutionary events such as a long persistence of relict populations in refuge zones during last glaciations  <cit> . in addition the dispersion of maternally inherited genomes  occurs at shorter geographic distances than for nuclear genomes. the consequence of a reduced gene dispersal and high genetic drift in organelle genomes is a generally pronounced geographic structure, which facilitates phylogeographic analyses as well as tracing the origins of cultivated species or invasive populations  <cit> ;  they exhibit a high number of identical copies per cell  <cit> , which may represent a significant advantage for forensic analyses;  they are circular and protected by a double-membrane envelope, which makes them resistant to exonucleases and less prone to endonuclease degradation ; and  they exhibit a lower mutation rate than nuclear genomes  <cit> , and such stability is generally required for traceability analyses .

the olive tree  is among the oldest woody crops, and nowadays represents one of the major cultivated species in the mediterranean area  <cit> . the origins of this species have been recently investigated using different molecular techniques, including looking at organelle variation  <cit> . these previous studies allowed the detection of seven main cpdna lineages in the o. europaea complex : lineage e <dig> was detected in the mediterranean area and saharan mountains, lineages e <dig> and e <dig> were specific to the western mediterranean area, lineage m was only detected in macaronesia, lineages c <dig> and c <dig> were observed from southern asia to eastern africa, and lineage a was characteristic of tropical african olives  <cit> . one limitation encountered during these studies was the particularly low level of cpdna and mtdna polymorphism in the mediterranean olive tree. until now only seven haplotypes have been detected with different combinations of loci  <cit> . these haplotypes belong to lineages e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> . recently, the first olive plastid genome  was released  <cit> . for detecting polymorphism in the cultivated olive tree, mariotti and co-workers analysed sequence variation in  <dig> cpdna fragments  <cit> . variable microsatellites , insertions/deletions  in repeated or non-repeated regions, and single nucleotide polymorphisms  were identified and allowed for the identification of six cpdna haplotypes  on a set of  <dig> cultivated olive trees, but they did not find new variants compared to previous studies  <cit> . the low cpdna variation detected in the mediterranean lineages hampered any applications of these markers, particularly for traceability or authenticity of olive oils  <cit> . such a low level of cpdna polymorphism has already been observed for other cultivated woody species such as prunus avium  <cit> , vitis vinifera  <cit>  and pinus pinea  <cit> . this is probably due to human dispersal of cultivated genotypes originating from a reduced gene pool. in addition, low cpdna polymorphism has also been reported in forest trees and this may also stem from low mutation rate in long-living organisms  <cit> . however, higher cpdna variation has been detected in wild olives than in cultivars, and this allowed some population genetic analyses, for instance in the laperrinei and guanchica subspecies from saharan mountains and canary islands, respectively  <cit> .

additional investigations are needed to maximise the cpdna haplotype identification in olive trees by testing new markers  on representatives of both cultivated and wild pools. here, we address this challenge. firstly, we sequenced the complete plastid genomes of seven o. europaea accessions, including one spanish cultivar  and six wild olive trees. these taxa were chosen to represent the seven lineages previously reported in the olive tree complex  <cit> . we also report the complete plastid genome of o. woodiana, a taxon belonging to sect. ligustroides, which is the sister clade to o. europaea  <cit> . secondly, based on these genome sequences, we developed a method for a rapid and routine characterisation of length variation in  <dig> regions plus two cleaved amplified polymorphism sequence loci . a set of  <dig> cultivars  as well as five distant wild olive tree populations  were characterised using this approach. based on the observed polymorphism, we propose an optimised set of primers to detect mediterranean haplotypes. we also discuss the utility of this approach for forensic analysis as well as for phylogeographic analyses of the olive tree complex.

RESULTS
in this study, eight complete olive tree plastid genomes were sequenced and deposited in genbank/embl under the accession numbers fn <dig>  fn <dig>  fn <dig>  fn <dig>  fn <dig>  fn <dig>  fn <dig> and fn <dig>  polymorphisms were used for the development of new markers to scan cpdna variation. these loci were used to characterise both cultivated and wild olive trees to assess their utility for forensic and phylogeographic studies. our general approach is summarised in figure  <dig> 

variation in olive tree chloroplast genomes
the cpdna genome sizes vary between  <dig>  base pairs  and  <dig>  bp . as suspected by besnard & bervillé  <cit>  based on rflps, two long indels were observed in the seven olive tree cpdna genomes: a 342-bp deletion  was observed in lineage e <dig> , while a 225-bp deletion  was detected in both individuals from south asia . in addition,  <dig> smaller indels  were also detected. five of these indels correspond to the presence/absence of a repeated motif of seven to  <dig> bp .

sequence variation was low, with a total of  <dig> substitutions on the seven olive plastid genomes. a maximum of  <dig> substitutions  was detected between gué de constantine  <dig>  and almhiwit  <dig>  , while cpdna genomes of guangzhou  <dig>  and almhiwit  <dig>   only showed  <dig> substitutions . the plastid genome of o. woodiana displays between  <dig> and  <dig> substitutions  when compared to the seven o. europaea genomes. again, this level of variation is surprisingly low if we consider that the divergence between sections olea  and ligustroides  is estimated to be between  <dig> and  <dig> million years . based on these results, the cpdna substitution rate was estimated to be between  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig> × 10- <dig> in the olea subgenus, which is about ten times lower than the typical mutation rate reported for the plastid genome  <cit> . this slow molecular evolution might be related to the long generation time of the olive tree  <cit> .

twelve differences  were observed between the genomes of 'frantoio'  and 'manzanilla de sevilla' . according to our approach, we re-sequenced the variable regions in 'frantoio', from the olive world germplasm bank  at córdoba, spain , but these polymorphisms were not confirmed. these  <dig> differences are not located in the cpdna regions screened for sequence variation by mariotti et al.  <cit>  and may be seen as putative sequencing mistakes in accession gu <dig>  considering this fact, our analyses indicate that 'frantoio' and 'manzanilla de sevilla' display the same plastid genome, supporting a common maternal origin for these two cultivars.

based only on nucleotide substitutions , phylogenetic relationships were depicted from the complete cpdna genomes using both maximum parsimony  and maximum likelihood  techniques . the resulting topologies confirm results from besnard et al.  <cit>  through the recovery of two main clades: a mediterranean/north african clade  including lineages e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig> and m, and a cuspidata clade  including lineages c <dig>  c <dig> and a. in clade cp-ii, moderate bootstrap support for an early-diverging position of lineage e <dig>  agrees with results based on a few cpdna microsatellites, indels and caps  <cit> . a moderate level of support was also recovered for the clustering of lineages e <dig> and e <dig>  only nine informative substitutions were detected in clade cp-ii, three of them being non-synonymous . the information brought by these sites does not strongly support any relationship, suggesting that some sites may be homoplastic. indeed, two of the three non-synonymous substitutions  are polymorphic in both clades cp-i and cp-ii, suggesting that these sites could be under selective pressures, either maintaining polymorphism or contributing to the recurrent appearance of the same substitution . understanding the molecular variation at these non-synonymous sites would deserve the design of an experiment to test their origin and their adaptive significance.

a sites are defined by their location in the 'manzanilla de sevilla' sequence. when the site is located in a coding sequence, the gene name is given in brackets.

* for non-synonymous substitutions, amino-acid changes are indicated below.

development of cpdna markers
the low cpdna substitution rate combined with possible selective effects  led us to focus on "length polymorphisms". such polymorphisms were either the result of a variable number of repeats in a microsatellite motif , or another type of insertion/deletion . sixty-two regions, of which  <dig> display variable microsatellite motifs, were investigated . these sites are located in non-coding regions  and can thus be considered as mostly neutral. the list of polymerase chain reaction  primers to amplify the  <dig> regions is given in additional file  <dig>  two caps loci  were also characterised to allow the distinction of new haplotypes in lineage e <dig> . after the characterisation of  <dig> cultivated and wild trees, a multilocus profile  was defined for each individual . also, an 88-year old herbarium leaf sample was successfully characterised, suggesting that our method is appropriate for investigating cpdna variation even on poorly preserved dna. a total of  <dig> loci were polymorphic in the mediterranean/north african olive tree . we hope that data generated using this method by different laboratories could be compared to generate a reference dataset for the mediterranean olive tree. in this way, it should be possible to reconstruct a detailed phylogeography of the species based on a large number of populations, as has been done, for instance, for the european white oaks  <cit> .

polymorphism assessment in the mediterranean olive
some olive tree varieties are used to produce high-quality  extra virgin olive oil. therefore, they may be granted a label of protected designation of origin . our markers could find some applications in the traceability of such high quality olive oils, but their discriminating power needs to be determined for assessing their putative utility. using our cpdna loci,  <dig> haplotypes were detected in cultivars : hence our approach permitted a two-fold increase of the number of detected variants compared to previous studies  <cit> . the most frequent haplotype  was detected in 77% of cultivars, including 'frantoio' and 'manzanilla de sevilla'. two other haplotypes  displayed a frequency superior to 5%, but the remaining haplotypes were rare, and sometimes detected only once  or twice . several of these rare haplotypes were detected in local cultivars with a limited economic importance . the probability that two samples chosen at random display a different haplotype was low  when compared to nuclear markers, especially nuclear microsatellites for which the discriminating power per locus generally exceeds  <dig>   <cit> . this indicates that the utility of the cpdna variation for forensic analysis is restricted to rare haplotypes such as the ones detected for 'picholine'  and 'olivière'  in france, 'villalonga'-'blanqueta' , 'farga'  and 'lechín de sevilla'  in spain, or 'megaritiki'  in greece. these varieties are used to produce high quality extra virgin olive oil . the cpdna variation, which is a priori easily analysable compared to nuclear single-copy genes, should thus be helpful to complement other procedures for olive traceability based on nuclear polymorphisms .

* see additional file  <dig> for the haplotype profile definition.

in the five populations of oleasters,  <dig> cpdna haplotypes were detected, ten of which were shared with cultivars . the discriminating power of cpdna was high in these populations  compared to the cultivated olive tree. fourteen haplotypes were unique to one population, while the four remaining haplotypes were shared between at least two populations: e <dig>  , e <dig>  and e <dig>   and e <dig>  . these four haplotypes have been detected in cultivated olive trees and could reflect long-distance gene flow mediated by humans  <cit> . in this way, the most frequent haplotype in cultivars  is also the most frequent and widespread haplotype in oleasters .

implications for phylogeography
previous cpdna phylogeographic studies of the mediterranean olive tree have been limited due to the low number of haplotypes detected  <cit> . here, we demonstrate that a genomic profiling approach of the plastid dna mostly based on microsatellites and indels can solve this problem. the high variation detected in five distant wild populations indicates a high potential of our approach for resolving the mediterranean olive tree history. one putative limitation is the level of homoplasy on microsatellite motifs, reported by different authors  <cit> , and which could prove problematic when accurately identifying evolutionary relationships between haplotypes. we reconstructed a reduced median network based on molecular markers . the mediterranean haplotypes clustered into three lineages , while the haplotype of subsp. maroccana formed a fourth lineage  in northern africa. this topology is fully congruent with besnard et al.  <cit> , who used different cpdna data . each lineage displays at least one specific indel, with the exception of lineage m . phylogenetic relationships remain unresolved at the base of lineages e <dig> and e <dig>  as well as in the centre of the network, as a consequence of homoplasy between haplotypes belonging to different lineages . such a difficulty for determining the ancestral state hampers the correct identification of historical links between divergent lineages. in contrast, we expect that homoplasy will not be a serious limitation to resolve phylogenetic relationships among lineages, since their haplotypes have diverged more recently  <cit> . in any case, for an optimal analysis of the cpdna variation at the population level, possible length homoplasy will need to be considered and the use of appropriate models will be necessary  <cit> .

the partial or complete cpdna sequencing of new individuals may reveal nucleotide substitutions that would be of interest  <cit>  for the development of new molecular markers like snps . such snps could be used to improve our approach. nevertheless, the homoplasy is not restricted to repetitive sequences as illustrated with non-synonymous sites in genes under selection, such as the polymorphism detected at the caps-xapi locus . in the present study, we found restriction polymorphism at this locus in lineages e <dig> and e <dig>  and also in clade cp-i  indicating that this site is highly homoplastic . thus, this site should be used with caution for phylogeographic purposes. nevertheless, we consider that it could bring potentially important information at the lineage level, particularly to solve the origin of haplotype e <dig>  in the cultivated gene pool .

CONCLUSIONS
a set of  <dig> polymorphic loci  is released for a rapid cpdna characterization of the mediterranean olive tree germplasm . we expect that, besides their potential forensics application, their use will be important for phylogeographic analyses. particularly, such studies should allow testing for the persistence of relict populations in the mediterranean basin  <cit> , as well as to test the hypotheses about their post-glacial expansion and subsequent domestication  <cit> . in addition, the identification of genuinely wild populations may represent a significant evolutionary heritage for the conservation of the mediterranean olive tree diversity. lastly, the combined use of both nuclear and cpdna resources should be useful to disentangle the impact of gene dispersal by seeds and pollen on the structure of the genetic diversity. for example, our cpdna markers will have applications for a comparative study of the dynamic of wild olive tree populations in different environments, such as archipelagos and saharan mountains  <cit> . such information may be relevant for defining appropriate strategies of prospection and in situ conservation of the wild olive tree.
