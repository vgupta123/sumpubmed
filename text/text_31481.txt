BACKGROUND
the relatively small genome of most positive-strand rna viruses compels these pathogens to use cellular machinery to complete their replication cycles. the search for these "host factors" utilized by positive-strand rna viruses is at the forefront of virology research, due in part to the possibility that cellular proteins or processes may represent more stable drug targets or provide broader antiviral activity when disrupted  <cit> . one diverse host factor that has been identified as crucial for positive-strand rna virus replication are intracellular membranes  <cit> . although viruses that contain a lipid envelope as a structural component clearly utilize cellular membranes to form infectious virions, all positive-strand rna viruses, both enveloped and non-enveloped, also depend on host intracellular membranes for the assembly and function of the viral rna replication complexes essential for genome amplification. the precise functions of cellular membranes in this process have not been fully defined, but may include:  serving as structural scaffolds for replication complex targeting and assembly;  protecting viral rna or replication intermediates from cellular antiviral defense responses; or  providing essential protein or lipid cofactors for optimal viral enzymatic activities. these proposed functions are not mutually exclusive, and it is likely that cellular membranes and their constituent components play multiple roles in viral rna replication.

to investigate the role of host factors in viral rna replication we use flock house virus , a versatile model virus and natural insect pathogen that assembles robust functional rna replication complexes in yeast  <cit> , plant  <cit> , mammalian  <cit> , nematode  <cit> , and insect cells  <cit> . this broad array of eukaryotic hosts that support fhv rna replication suggests that cellular factors utilized by this virus are widely conserved. the fhv genome is bipartite, with two positive-sense rna segments copackaged into a non-enveloped virion . the larger  <dig> -kb genomic segment, rna <dig>  encodes protein a, the fhv rna-dependent rna polymerase, which is the only viral protein required for functional rna replication complex assembly. fhv assembles its rna replication complexes on mitochondrial outer membranes  <cit> , where they are targeted and anchored in part via an amino-proximal transmembrane domain present within protein a  <cit> . during rna replication fhv produces a  <dig> -kb subgenomic segment, rna <dig>  which encodes the rna interference  suppressor protein b <dig>  this viral counterdefense protein is required for maximal viral rna synthesis in cells with an active rnai antiviral system  <cit> . since subgenomic rna <dig>  and hence protein b <dig>  are produced only during active rna replication, they serve as convenient and quantitative markers for fhv rna replication complex activity. the smaller  <dig> -kb genomic segment, rna <dig>  encodes the structural capsid protein precursor. the fhv capsid protein is required for infectious virion production but is dispensable for viral rna replication, and therefore engineered self-replicating viral rnas, termed replicons, need only contain fhv rna <dig> .

apart from the membrane localization of its viral rna replication complexes, additional lines of evidence point to the importance of membranes, and in particular lipids, in fhv replication. protein a is a lipid-binding protein with particular affinity for specific anionic phospholipids  <cit> , which may mediate in part the protein a-membrane interactions required for replication complex assembly. fhv rna replication induces dramatic mitochondrial membrane rearrangements  <cit> , reminiscent of structures seen with other positive-strand rna viruses  <cit> . the fatty acid synthetase inhibitor cerulenin disrupts fhv rna replication  <cit> , consistent with the activity of this inhibitor on other positive-strand rna viruses  <cit> . finally, fhv rna replication complex activity in isolated membrane fractions analyzed in vitro is disrupted by certain detergents  <cit> , and can be augmented by the addition of exogenous phospholipids  <cit> . these results all suggest a central role of cellular lipid metabolism in fhv rna replication complex assembly and function. however, none of them provide direct evidence for a functional impact of specific lipid metabolism pathways on fhv rna replication within intact cells.

in this report, we use complementary transcriptomic, lipidomic, and targeted functional genetic analyses to specifically examine the role of lipids in fhv rna replication in cultured drosophila cells. we demonstrate that fhv infection or replicon expression upregulates the transcription of a distinct set of cellular genes, several of which are involved in lipid metabolism. furthermore, fhv rna replication induces global changes in cellular phospholipid content, and in particular phosphatidylcholine , and pharmacologic or genetic disruption of pc synthesis within cells inhibits fhv rna replication.

RESULTS
fhv rna replication induces transcriptional upregulation of lipid metabolism genes in drosophila s <dig> cells
we examined the transcriptional responses of drosophila s <dig> cells to fhv rna replication using genome-wide microarray analyses. to focus on cellular responses related to rna replication rather than those associated with other steps in the viral life cycle, such as virion attachment, entry, uncoating, encapsidation, and virion release, we conducted parallel analyses of cells either infected with fhv or transfected with an rna <dig> replicon-expression plasmid. the rna <dig> segment of the fhv genome encodes the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase  and is the only genome segment required for rna replication . thus, fhv rna replication can be initiated in s <dig> cells by the introduction of a self-replicating rna <dig> via the inducible plasmid ps2f <dig>   <cit> . to maximize the number of s <dig> cells expressing the replicon, we first generated stable cell lines containing ps2f <dig> or a control plasmid  containing a translation-defective rna <dig> segment. although there was a low level of baseline fhv rna replication in ps2f1-expressing cells due to leaky metallothionein promoter activity, induction with copper sulfate resulted in a dramatic increase in subgenomic rna <dig> and protein b <dig> accumulation, indicative of highly active viral rna replication complexes .

we analyzed transcript levels from three independent experiments with either fhv-infected cells or cells expressing an rna <dig> replicon, and identified cellular genes whose transcription was significantly up- or downregulated in response to these stimuli. we identified  <dig> genes that were significantly upregulated and  <dig> genes that were significantly downregulated in fhv-infected s <dig> cells , and  <dig> genes that were significantly upregulated in ps2f1-expressing cells . there were no significantly downregulated genes in ps2f1-expressing cells. full details regarding the molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components for these genes are provided in the additional files. we further analyzed these datasets for transcripts that were upregulated with both stimuli and identified  <dig> co-regulated genes, which encoded proteins involved in numerous aspects of cellular physiology, such as metabolism, defense responses, and signal transduction . based in part on the well recognized importance of cellular membranes in positive-strand rna virus replication  <cit> , we focused on those genes that encoded proteins with known or hypothesized roles in lipid metabolism. we found that infection with fhv upregulated eight lipid metabolism-associated genes, whereas rna <dig> replicon expression upregulated thirteen lipid metabolism-associated genes . four of these genes were upregulated in both datasets, including cct <dig> and cct <dig>  which encode ctp:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferases. these enzymes are essential for the salvage pathway of pc synthesis but have non-overlapping functions in drosophila cells  <cit> . we validated both cct <dig> and cct <dig> mrna upregulation by rt-pcr after fhv infection  and rna <dig> replicon expression . these results demonstrated that fhv rna replication in drosophila s <dig> cells was associated with distinct alterations in cellular gene transcription, including the transcription of genes associated with lipid metabolism.

biological process designation was determined from either direct go biological process terms or inferred from go molecular function terms curated from the flybase database http://flybase.org/. complete data for co-upregulated genes, including flybase id, ccg number, gene symbol, gene name, go terms , genetic interaction partners, yeast and human orthologs, and fold change are provided as additional file  <dig> 

fhv rna replication alters phospholipid levels in drosophila s <dig> cells
the conclusion that fhv rna replication was associated with transcriptional upregulation of lipid metabolism genes predicts that quantifiable changes in lipid constituents should also be observed, particularly with respect to pc content. to examine this prediction we measured total pc levels in s <dig> cells after infection or replicon expression using a modified phospholipase d-based biochemical assay  <cit>  . as a control for these experiments we used cells treated with 1-hexadecylphosphorylcholine , which is a specific ctp:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase inhibitor  <cit> . s <dig> cells infected with fhv had a 35% increase in total pc levels, whereas treatment with miltefosine reduced pc levels by 40% . furthermore, although baseline pc levels in stably transfected cells were increased compared to untransfected cells, expression of an fhv rna <dig> replicon was associated with a 70% increase in pc levels . these results indicated that fhv rna replication-associated transcriptional upregulation of pc biosynthetic genes in s <dig> cells  was associated with a concomitant increase in cellular pc levels.

to evaluate potential lipid changes associated with fhv replication in s <dig> cells in more detail we used electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry  to quantitate polar phospholipids in extracts from fhv-infected cells. this analysis allowed the determination of relative individual phospholipid species content as a molar percentage of total recovered polar phospholipids but also provided details on total acyl chain length and saturation levels. as controls for these experiments we used cells treated with miltefosine to decrease pc levels or cells cultured with  <dig> mm oleic acid , which increases the production of phospholipids with individual c18: <dig> acyl chains and hence total sum acyl chain compositions of c36: <dig>  complete detailed results from the esi-ms/ms analyses are provided in additional file  <dig>  control membrane extracts from s <dig> cells contained predominantly pc and phosphatidylethanolamine  as the primary phospholipids, with the latter representing the majority  of all phospholipids . although pc is typically the most prominent phospholipid in most eukaryotic cell membranes, diptera species such as drosophila contain relatively high levels of pe  <cit> . as expected, miltefosine dramatically reduced pc content with compensatory increases in the percentages of pe and phosphatidylinositol . in contrast, total cellular membranes from fhv-infected s <dig> cells showed a trend towards an increase in the molar percentage of pc and phosphatidylserine  with an associated decrease in pe content, but these differences were not statistically significant . however, when we analyzed pc species based on total acyl chain length or saturation level there were modest but statistically significant changes in the percentage of pc molecules with total acyl chain lengths of  <dig> or  <dig> carbons  and  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> total double bonds , where fhv infection increased the fraction of pc molecules with longer unsaturated acyl chains. furthermore, the selective increase in longer unsaturated acyl chains in fhv-infected cells was seen specifically with pc and not pe, pi, or ps . these quantitative lipid analysis results suggested that fhv infection induces selective changes in pc metabolism, and are consistent with the observation that fhv rna replication complex activity in isolated membrane fractions analyzed in vitro is preferentially stimulated by phospholipids with increased acyl chain length and decreased saturation  <cit> .

manipulation of glycerophospholipid metabolism gene expression modulates fhv rna replication in drosophila s <dig> cells
we next examined the potential functional significance of lipid metabolism gene upregulation on fhv rna replication in s <dig> cells using a targeted genetic approach that employed rnai-mediated knockdown  <cit> . we identified thirty-one cdnas within the o'farrell rnai collection  <cit>  that were targeted toward genes involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism in drosophila cells, generated 300- <dig> bp dsrnas, and performed rnai knockdown experiments with infected s <dig> cells using dsrna targeted against fhv rna <dig> and miltefosine as positive controls . to quantitate fhv rna replication, we used an optimized capture enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay  that detected protein b <dig>  which is a viral protein only produced during active rna replication . although protein b <dig> is an rnai suppressor, it functions during the assembly of rnai-induced silencing complexes  <cit> , and therefore would have less impact on the activity of functional silencing complexes formed during the  <dig> h dsrna incubation period prior to fhv infection. we found that dsrnas directed against five cellular genes, ace, cct <dig>  cct <dig>  fu <dig>  and san, all significantly suppressed fhv rna replication in infected s <dig> cells . although the level of suppression was 20-40% with individual knockdown of these five genes, the positive control fhv dsrna only reduced protein b <dig> levels by ~45%, suggesting that this medium throughput assay provided a conservative estimate of the functional impact of cellular glycerophospholipid metabolism gene knockdown. the functions of cct <dig> and cct <dig> have been described above. ace encodes acetylcholine esterase  <cit> , fu <dig> encodes an enzyme with 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity  <cit> , and san also encodes an enzyme with acyltransferase activity  <cit> . the enzymes encoded by cct <dig>  cct <dig>  ace, fu <dig>  and san are all involved in pc synthesis, either directly or indirectly . the main glycerophospholipids in the cell, pc and pe, are synthesized through two metabolic pathways, the de novo synthesis pathway that uses ps as a precursor for both, and the salvage or cdp pathway, also referred to as the kennedy pathway, which recycles choline and ethanolamine to produce pc and pe, respectively  <cit> . in higher eukaryotes the salvage or cdp pathway of pc synthesis normally predominates, where the conversion of phosphocholine to cdp-choline, which is catalyzed by ctp:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferases such as those encoded by cct <dig> and cct <dig>  is the rate limiting step  <cit> . thus, we chose to focus further on these two drosophila glycerophospholipid synthesis genes.

to verify the functional impact of cct <dig> and cct <dig> activity on fhv rna replication in s <dig> cells, we generated alternative dsrnas targeting different coding regions of these two genes and repeated rnai-mediated knockdown experiments, including co-knockdown of both cct <dig> and cct <dig> mrna . we validated knockdown of cct <dig> and cct <dig> mrna expression by rt-pcr, where we obtained an approximate 80-90% gene-specific reduction in steady state levels . furthermore, quantitative analysis demonstrated a 30-35% reduction in total pc levels with individual knockdown of either cct <dig> or cct <dig> mrna, and a ~60% reduction with knockdown of both genes . the incomplete knockdown of cct <dig> and cct <dig> mrna, the presence of a cct-independent de novo pc synthesis pathway , and the essential role that pc plays in cellular structure and metabolism all likely contributed to the lack of synergistic suppression of total pc levels with an rnai-based approach that targeted one step in the biosynthetic pathway. we also examined cell viability by mtt assay, as disruption of ctp:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase expression or function in mammalian cells results in enhanced susceptibility to apoptosis  <cit> . individual knockdown of either cct <dig> or cct <dig> mrna had no significant impact on cell viability, whereas co-knockdown of both genes resulted in a small but reproducible 15% reduction in cell viability as measured by mtt assay . we infected s <dig> cells with fhv after rnai-mediated suppression of cct <dig>  cct <dig>  or both genes, and measured viral rna and protein accumulation at  <dig> h after infection. downregulation of either cct <dig> or cct <dig> individually suppressed fhv subgenomic rna <dig> accumulation by ~30%, but did not significantly reduce the accumulation of genomic rna <dig>  rna <dig>  or protein a . however, downregulation of both cct <dig> and cct <dig> resulted in a 40-65% reduction in the accumulation of all viral products examined, similar to the levels of suppression seen with the positive controls miltefosine and dsrna directly targeting fhv rna <dig>  although we cannot exclude the possibility that the small reduction in cell viability with co-knockdown of both cct <dig> and cct <dig>  adversely affected viral rna or protein accumulation, potentially via apoptosis-mediated reduction in synthesis or stability, published studies have demonstrated that fhv replication is not sensitive to the antiviral effects of apoptosis induction in drosophila cells  <cit> . these results indicated that genetic or pharmacologic disruption of pc synthesis inhibited fhv rna replication in infected s <dig> cells.

to further examine the functional impact of cct <dig> and cct <dig> on fhv rna replication in the absence of infectious virus, we repeated experiments using rnai-mediated downregulation of these genes in s <dig> cells expressing an rna <dig> replicon . we could not use stably transfected cells for genetic knockdown experiments, as the low level of fhv rna replication in these cells in the absence of copper sulfate induction resulted in protein b <dig> production that inhibited rnai-mediated downregulation of cellular genes . therefore, we used a transient transfection approach. we treated s <dig> cells with dsrnas for  <dig> h, transfected cells with ps2f <dig>  and control plasmid ps2lacz, and measured fhv rna replication by northern blotting and β-galactosidase activity by enzymatic assay  <dig> h after induction. we used ps2lacz as a transfection control, as modulation of pc levels may influence transfection efficiency. knockdown of either cct <dig> or cct <dig> suppressed fhv rna <dig> accumulation by 20-40% in ps2f1-transfected cells, whereas knockdown of both genes increased suppression to 65%, similar to levels seen with control dsrna targeted against fhv rna <dig> . we did not quantitate genomic rna <dig> or protein a accumulation levels in transfected cells, as these viral products accumulated to low and almost undetectable levels in ps2f1-transfected cells , such that attempts at quantitation would have been unreliable. nevertheless, these results supported the conclusion that disruption of pc synthesis by genetic modulation of cct <dig> or cct <dig> inhibited fhv rna replication.

finally, we examined whether disruption of cct <dig> or cct <dig> expression directly suppressed fhv protein a accumulation or membrane association , as we have previously demonstrated that cellular factors can impact viral rna polymerase production  <cit>  and hence facilitate an early step in rna replication complex assembly . although protein a levels were decreased in fhv-infected cells with rnai-mediated downregulation of both genes , protein a accumulation in the setting of infectious virus or an fhv replicon is directly linked to rna replication . thus, we used a protein a expression vector, called ps2fa-ha , which is designed to optimize translation and prevent rna replication via modification of 5' and 3' untranslated sequences that contain essential cis elements  <cit> . in contrast to the effects of cct1- or cct2-specific dsrnas on fhv rna replication , knockdown of either gene had no effect on rna polymerase accumulation in cells transfected with ps2fa-ha , whereas dsrnas against hsp <dig> suppressed polymerase accumulation by 60%, consistent with published studies demonstrating the important role of hsp <dig> chaperones in fhv protein a synthesis  <cit> . furthermore, knockdown of cct <dig>  cct <dig>  or both genes did not alter the ability of protein a to associate with intracellular membranes, as determined by differential centrifugation . these results indicated that pc synthesis was important for fhv rna replication but not viral polymerase production or membrane association.

discussion
global approaches such as transcriptomic, proteomic, and functional genomic analyses have provided important clues to critical host-pathogen interactions that influence virus replication and pathogenesis  <cit> . however, these approaches when used in isolation often provide an overwhelming amount of information that requires careful selection and validation. we have used an alternative approach that incorporates more targeted analyses including lipidomics to specifically examine the role of glycerophospholipid metabolism in fhv rna replication. the results presented in this report further support the well described crucial role that intracellular membranes play in positive-strand rna virus replication  <cit> , but emphasize that cellular lipids are key membrane constituents for this particular host-pathogen interaction. furthermore, this report provides new details on the impact of specific lipid metabolism pathways on viral rna replication, and in particular pc biosynthesis. the identification of specific lipid metabolism pathways is an essential first step in the rationale design of antiviral strategies that target cellular rather than viral components. indeed, the recognition that cholesterol metabolism is important for hepatitis c virus replication in cultured cells  <cit>  has led to direct clinical trials using cholesterol synthesis inhibitors  <cit> .

the observation that pc is important for fhv rna replication in cells is consistent with results published almost twenty years ago, which demonstrated that phospholipids enhance fhv rna replication complex activity in isolated membrane fractions analyzed in vitro  <cit> . it also supports the hypothesis that one potential role cellular membranes play in viral rna replication is to provide functional co-factors such as phospholipids for optimal rna polymerase activity, and is consistent with published observations on the functional impact that phospholipids have on semliki forest virus nsp <dig> methyltransferase activity  <cit> . the precise mechanism whereby phospholipids enhance fhv rna replication complex activity is unknown, and there are multiple steps during process of viral rna replication that could be influenced by these cellular components . interestingly, the observation that individual knockdown of cct <dig> or cct <dig> expression had an apparent preferential effect on subgenomic rna <dig> production  suggests that this particular step may be especially sensitive to cellular phospholipids. in addition to their potential roles as functional cofactors, membrane-resident lipids may also play other roles during rna replication, such as providing a scaffold for replication complex targeting and assembly. indeed, we recently demonstrated that fhv protein a is a lipid-binding protein with particular affinity for anionic phospholipids, including the mitochondrial-specific phospholipid cardiolipin  <cit> . interestingly, we could not detect a significant physical interaction between fhv protein a and pc using in vitro assays  <cit> , suggesting that pc may influence protein a activity indirectly or interact via some as yet unidentified intermediate protein or lipid.

transcriptional array results suggested that fhv rna replication stimulated pc synthesis in part via cct <dig> or cct <dig> upregulation, but the molecular mechanisms whereby fhv modulates lipid biosynthesis are unknown. one hypothesis is that fhv simply takes advantage of the cellular stress response to virus infection that may induce changes in phospholipid metabolism. however, published microarray results with cultured s <dig> cells infected with various pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, parasites, or fungi do not demonstrate a consistent upregulation of glycerophospholipid metabolism-related genes  <cit> . an alternative hypothesis is that fhv directly and specifically modulates glycerophospholipid metabolism. interestingly, the enzyme encoded by drosophila cct <dig> is activated by cellular lipids, and in particular cardiolipin  <cit> , suggesting a potential link with the observed protein a-cardiolipin interaction  <cit> . phosphatidic acid, which represents the essential precursor in the synthesis of all glycerophospholipids  <cit>  , also physically interacts with fhv protein a  <cit>  and could serve as a potential conduit for regulation. although these hypotheses are speculative and cannot directly explain transcriptional upregulation, they are readily testable with fhv using established in vitro and in vivo systems.

we focused on pc for this report, but our results do not exclude the potential important role of other cellular phospholipids in fhv rna replication. indeed, both transcriptomic  and functional genetic  analyses identified numerous additional candidate lipid metabolism-associated genes linked to fhv rna replication. furthermore, the lipidomics analysis examined total cellular membrane lipid content, whereas fhv rna replication complexes localize to outer mitochondrial membranes and induce dramatic morphological and structural changes  <cit> . although most glycerophospholipids, and in particular the highly abundant pc and pe, are widely distributed in membranes throughout the cell  <cit> , detailed analyses of mitochondrial outer membrane lipids may reveal interesting and potentially more dramatic changes than we observed with the total cellular lipid analyses. experiments are currently in progress to isolate and examine mitochondrial and submitochondrial fractions from cells with active fhv rna replication complexes using well established techniques  <cit> . in addition, the observation that specific acyl chain modifications that result in longer unsaturated pc species were seen in fhv-infected cells suggests that particular lipid changes apart from the phospholipid head group also may play important roles in viral rna replication. this is consistent with the demonstration that brome mosaic virus rna replication is suppressed in yeast with a deletion of the enzyme Δ <dig> fatty acid desaturase  <cit> . fhv replicates robustly in saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> , and preliminary results suggest that fhv rna replication in yeast is also influenced by alterations in pc metabolism . phospholipid metabolism pathways and their regulation have been well studied in yeast  <cit> , and therefore this genetically tractable host provides an excellent companion for parallel studies with drosophila cells to further examine the impact of lipid metabolism on fhv rna replication.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we demonstrate through a combination of complementary targeted and global analyses that glycerophospholipids, and in particular pc, play an important role in fhv rna replication. these results enhance our understanding of the essential function that cellular membranes have in facilitating positive-strand rna virus replication, and suggest that modulating cellular phospholipid synthesis may represent a novel approach for targeted antiviral development.
