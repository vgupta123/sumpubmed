BACKGROUND
genes coding for insecticidal proteins from the bacterium bacillus thuringiensis  have been transferred to plants to protect them from the attack of insect pests  <cit>  and the global impact of this strategy has been unprecedented in plant biotechnology. unfortunately, and similarly with the history of chemical insecticides, insects have developed resistance to b. thuringiensis crystal proteins  when exposed to either foliar b. thuringiensis sprays or transgenic crops   <cit> . the long lasting benefits of b. thuringiensis insecticides and bt-crops will mostly depend on the understanding of the mode of action of cry proteins and of the biochemical and genetic bases of insect resistance.

all b. thuringiensis crystal proteins  which are toxic to target insects share general traits in their mode of action: solubilization in the midgut, activation by gut proteases, binding to membrane surface proteins   <cit> . susceptible insects have epitopes in their membrane receptors that are recognized by sequences of the cry proteins. this is probably the main reason why cry proteins are not harmful to non-target insects  <cit> . the key role of membrane receptors has also become evident when studying the biochemical basis of insect resistance to cry toxins. most cases of high level resistance to cry1a proteins have been shown to be due to a decrease of toxin binding to midgut receptors  <cit> .

two approaches have been undertaken to characterize membrane proteins involved in the toxicity of cry proteins. formerly, the approach was biochemical, and it allowed for the characterization of receptors such as cadherin, aminopeptidase n , and alkaline phosphatase   <cit> , among others. the occurrence of such a variety of receptors has been explained by integrating them in a ‘toxicity pathway’ that implies their participation in a sequential way  <cit> . in the most accepted model, binding to cadherin is required for the cry proteins to oligomerize and then bind to other receptors, such as apn and alp, which favor toxin insertion into the membrane. there is evidence supporting the participation of cadherin and apn in the toxicity of cry proteins  <cit> . furthermore, mutations conferring resistance to proteins from the cry1a family have been found in the cadherin gene from heliothis virescens <cit> , helicoverpa armigera <cit>  and in pectinophora gossypiella <cit> . similarly, mutations or reduced expression of apn genes have been found in resistant insects from spodoptera exigua <cit> , diatraea saccharallis <cit>  and trichoplusia ni <cit> .

another membrane protein, identified as an abcc <dig> transporter, was found related to the mode of action of cry1a-type proteins using a genetic approach to identify major genes involved in resistance in h. virescens <cit> . later on, mutations in the abcc <dig> gene were found in cry1a resistant colonies from three other insect species: plutella xylostella <cit> , t. ni <cit> , and bombyx mori <cit> . further evidence for the involvement of the abcc <dig> transporter in cry1a toxicity came from functional studies with transfected cultured cells  <cit> . although mutations in either the cadherin or in the abcc <dig> gene alone may suffice to render high levels of resistance, it seems clear that the occurrence of both functional genes is necessary for the full toxicity of cry1a proteins  <cit> . although the binding of cry1a proteins to the abcc <dig> transporter has never been directly shown, it is thought that the abcc <dig> transporter transiently binds the cry oligomer and mediates its insertion from the apn or alp receptors to the membrane  <cit> .

in a previous work we have reported an s. exigua strain  with high levels  of resistance to a b. thuringiensis-based pesticide, xentari™  <cit> . expression of about  <dig> midgut genes was analyzed by dna-macroarray in order to find differences in midgut gene expression between susceptible and resistant insects. among the differentially expressed genes, repat and arylphorin were identified and their increased expression was correlated with b. thuringiensis resistance. we also found overlap among genes that were constitutively over-expressed in resistant insects with genes that were up-regulated in susceptible insects after exposure to xentari™, suggesting a permanent activation of the response to xentari™ in resistant insects. however, we could not determine the exact resistant gene or genes and the molecular mechanism responsible of the high levels of resistance to b. thuringiensis in these insects.

in the present paper we used bulk segregant analysis  based on high-throughput sequencing methodologies   <cit>  to identify regions in the s. exigua genome containing loci for major resistance genes in xen-r strain  <cit> . the results reveal two abcc genes  involved in the mode of action of b. thuringiensis toxins and a mutation in one of them  as responsible for the resistance of s. exigua to a b. thuringiensis commercial product and to its main active ingredients, cry1ca and cry1a toxins. the current results expand the role of the abcc <dig> transporter in b. thuringiensis resistance beyond the cry1a family of proteins to include cry1ca.

RESULTS
construction of backcross families for resistance mapping
mapping of resistance was approached by mixing the resistant and susceptible genomes followed by selection for resistance after one round of backcrosses. at the concentration of the xentari™ product used, xen-r showed incomplete resistance because 65% of the larvae did not survive the treatment. the same treatment killed 100% of fra and f <dig> larvae, indicating that resistance was completely recessive at the diagnostic concentration. after crossing f <dig> and xen-r adults and selection with the discriminant concentration of the xentari™ product, three families resulting from independent backcrosses were randomly selected for the bsa. mortality in the treated samples was 87% for bc <dig>  89% for bc <dig> and 84% for bc <dig>  considering that the baseline mortality for xen-r was 65%, the mortality in the three backcross  families is in good agreement with resistance being due to one major locus. survivors from the three bc families were pooled  and used for the bsa.

new generation sequencing, assembly and mapping
parental samples were differentially tagged and sequenced in a single hi-seq <dig> paired-end  line and sel-bc in a second line. a summary of the sequencing and assembling process is reported in table  <dig>  these reads , along with the  <dig>  sequences from the 454-sequencing and the previously published  <dig>  sanger sequences  <cit> , were assembled using trinity, yielding a total of  <dig>  unigenes and  <dig>  gene clusters with an average length of 881 bp, with a total length 119 mb. these unigenes were filtered to remove small, non-highly expressed anonymous unigenes. finally,  <dig>  unigenes and  <dig>  gene clusters were kept, with an average size of  <dig> . <dig> and a total length of 109 mb . these unigenes were compared using bi-directional blast search with bombyx and drosophila proteins. for  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes, orthologs were identified in drosophila and silkworm, respectively . all reads were mapped against a filtered reference transcriptome built with the longest unigene of each gene cluster. the proportion of the total sequences which could be properly mapped was  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % from sel-bc, fra and xen-r, respectively. the average coverage was  <dig> x.

bulk segregant analysis
using varscan,  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  and  <dig>  indels were identified . to select unigenes with a biased allele distribution in the sel-bc sample, the following index was calculated: ratio of snps with the xen-r allele fixed in sel-bc  against the total number of snps. this index ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  unigenes with an index close to  <dig> had a bias towards the allele present in the xen-r parental. this index was plotted along with the bombyx genome  by using the position of the respective bombyx orthologs. a total of  <dig> unigenes . with a silkworm ortholog were available. two wide bombyx genomic regions with a high bias towards the resistant allele were detected: a wider region in chromosome  <dig> and another smaller region in chromosome  <dig>  the region in chromosome  <dig> spanned from  <dig>  to  <dig> , <dig> of nscaf <dig> scaffold and contained homologs to 64 s. exigua unigenes. the region in chromosome  <dig> spread from  <dig>  to  <dig> , <dig> of nscaf <dig> scaffold and contained homologs to 42 s. exigua unigenes.

detailed analysis of the chromosome  <dig> region did not reveal genes potentially involved in the mode of action of b. thuringiensis or other entomopathogens. moreover, we could not identify any snps associated with sel-bc or xen-r insects having a major effect  on the codified proteins when compared to the alleles in fra insects.

chromosomal regions from several insect species homologous to a region in chromosome  <dig> in b. mori have been previously associated with resistance to b. thuringiensis cry1a toxins  <cit> . such a b. mori region contains several members of the abcc family. detailed analysis of unigenes from s. exigua in that region identified three abcc genes, which we named abcc <dig>  abcc <dig> and abcc <dig> according to a phylogenetic analysis with representative members of abc transporter genes from other lepidoptera and coleoptera . the s. exigua abcc <dig> and abbc <dig> genes codify for a 12-transmembrane domain protein . although our transcriptome did not contain the complete abcc <dig> unigene sequence, comparison with other abcc <dig> genes suggests that it codifies for a protein with a topology similar to that of other abcc <dig> transporters. allelic comparison of unigenes in that region revealed a major mutation in the abcc <dig> gene: a deletion of  <dig> nucleotides  in the unigene from the xen-r and sel-bc samples, but not from the fra sample. despite the high coverage for that gene in the sel-bc sample, no single read was observed mapping into the deleted region. the deleted region included a fragment of the predicted atp binding domain  <dig> in the hypothetical protein . further analysis of the genomic region revealed a deletion of about  <dig> nucleotides extending over two exons .

based on these results, we decided to focus on the possible function of the abcc <dig> and abcc <dig> proteins, especially on their role in the susceptibility to b. thuringiensis toxins and the effect of the abcc <dig> mutation on the binding of cry1ca toxin to the insect midgut.

expression profiles of seabcc <dig> and seabcc <dig> genes in s. exigua
gene expression of seabcc <dig> and seabcc <dig> was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  in different developmental stages of s. exigua and in different tissues of fifth instar larvae. seabcc <dig> and seabcc <dig> were expressed in all larval instars and in the adult stage although at early stages seabcc <dig> was apparently more strongly expressed than seabbc <dig> . regarding tissue distribution , seabcc <dig> was highly expressed in the gut and hemocytes; in addition, the sample from the fat body gave a very faint amplification band. seabcc <dig> was also highly expressed in the gut and hemocytes and faint amplification bands were obtained in samples from the fat body and nerve, but not from the salivary glands.

effect of seabcc <dig> and seabcc <dig> suppression on the susceptibility of s. exigua to cry1ac and cry1ca
to study the role of these proteins in the susceptibility of s. exigua to b. thuringiensis toxins, seabcc genes were silenced by rna interference  and the suppressed larvae were tested for their susceptibility to two different cry <dig> toxins. prior to performing bioassays with double-stranded rna -treated larvae, the susceptibility of non-treated s. exigua third instar larvae to cry1ac and cry1ca protoxins was determined under our experimental conditions. as expected, cry1ca was significantly more toxic than cry1ac, with lc <dig> values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/ml, respectively. the toxin concentrations that yielded mortality between 90% and 100% were  <dig> and 1 μg/cm <dig> for cry1ac and cry1ca, respectively . these toxin concentrations were chosen for subsequent experiments with dsrna.

expression of seabcc <dig> and seabcc <dig> started to decrease after 12 hours of dsdna ingestion, but the suppression was more drastic after 48 hours and lasted at least up to 72 hours in both cases . cross-suppression between the two genes was discarded by estimation of seabcc <dig> expression in dsseabcc3-treated insects and vice versa . when s. exigua larvae were treated with either dsseabcc <dig> or dsseabcc <dig> and then exposed to 10 μg/cm <dig> of cry1ac or 1 μg/cm <dig> of cry1ca, they showed a significant decrease in susceptibility to these two toxins . in particular, silencing of seabcc <dig> highly decreased cry1ca toxicity to s. exigua compared with silencing of seabcc <dig>  under these conditions, control larvae suffered about 92% and 95% larval mortality to cry1ac or cry1ca, respectively.

binding of cry1ca to brush border membrane vesicles from resistant and susceptible larvae
since mutations in the abcc <dig> transporters have been proposed to confer resistance to insects from different species that lacked binding of one or more cry1a proteins  <cit>  binding of 125i-labeled cry1ca was tested in susceptible and resistant insects to see whether binding was altered in the latter . competition binding curves indicated that resistant insects had a high contribution of non-specific binding  to the total binding . the equilibrium binding parameters did not differ significantly between the two types of insects and the only significant differences were found in the concentration of binding sites . specific binding of cry toxins to their membrane receptors consists of a reversible binding component and an irreversible binding component associated with the toxin insertion into the membrane  <cit> . to search for additional possible differences in binding, an experiment was designed to dissect the total specific binding into its reversible and irreversible components. the results showed a significant decrease in the irreversible component of the specific binding in resistant insects as compared with susceptible insects . however, the reversible component was similar in both cases.

fitness-cost associated with the silencing of seabcc <dig> or seabcc <dig> expression
the effect of silencing of either seabcc <dig> or seabcc <dig> on the fitness of the insects was also measured. reduction in the expression level of both genes had a statistically significant influence on both pupation and adult emergence. feeding dsrna specific to either seabcc <dig> or seabcc <dig> reduced the percentage of pupation to 70% and 81%, respectively  and the percentage of adult emergence to 72% and 68%, respectively . treatment of dsseabcc <dig> also had a significant effect on the pupal weight, although that of dsseabcc <dig> did not  . in contrast, none of the treatments had a significant effect on the duration of the pupal stage, which in all cases took five to six days from the first day of pupation till adult emergence .

overexpression of arylphorin and repat <dig> genes induced by seabcc <dig> and seabcc <dig> suppression
since both arylphorin and repat <dig> have been reported to be overexpressed in the xen-r insects  <cit> , it was of interest to determine whether the silencing of seabcc <dig> or seabcc <dig> could have an effect on the expression of these genes. the results show, in agreement with previous reports, that when either the seabcc <dig> or seabcc <dig> gene is silenced, both arylphorin and repat <dig> genes increased their expression as compared with that of the controls .

discussion
forward genetics has been useful in shedding light on new resistance mechanisms to cry1a proteins in insects. relatively recently, the role of the abcc <dig> transporter has been made evident in the mode of action of cry1a proteins through linking resistance to mutations in this membrane protein in four different insect species  <cit> . we have successfully adapted standard bsa procedure to our particular conditions: 1) since we could not easily discriminate susceptible insects in the bc offsprings we have only used one of the bulk extremes . as a consequence, evidence of linkage to resistance was not deduced by the comparison of the frequency of the markers in the two bulks, but by comparing their frequency deviation from the expected 50% and their deduced genomic localization. 2) due to the absence of genomic information on s. exigua, the resistance gene has been positioned and deduced using the genome of a related lepidoptera, b. mori. 3) genetic markers have been discovered by rna sequencing instead of direct examination of genomic dna. bsa based on rna information could introduce a certain bias because the cdna contribution to the bulk can be allele specific. to prevent or minimize such a possibility the signal has been detected at the genomic level and not at the gene level, thus averaging out the possible bias present in one particular gene. our approach using ngs and bsa applied to s. exigua has pinpointed two genomic regions with high segregation distortion that have a high probability of containing genes involved in the resistance to b. thuringiensis. bsa has been previously employed for the identification of a pesticide resistance gene  <cit> ; however, as far as we know, this is the first report of successful mapping of insect resistance genes by combining asymmetric bsa with rna sequencing.

one of these two regions contained three genes coding for abc type c transporters, including the abcc <dig> gene along with abcc <dig> and abcc <dig> genes. the sequences of the abcc <dig> and abcc <dig> genes coded for 12-transmembrane domain proteins. most interestingly, the abcc <dig> allele from the resistant insects contained a deletion that eliminates a cytoplasmic portion of the protein affecting one of the two atp binding regions, making this gene a candidate for the resistance in the xen-r colony. the second region, located in chromosome  <dig>  did not reveal genes potentially involved in the mode of action of b. thuringiensis, although we cannot discard the presence of additional genes in such a region contributing to the resistance in the xen-r insects. alternatively, synteny is not complete in lepidoptera and it could be possible that both regions are located in the same chromosome in s. exigua.

to determine the role of the abcc <dig> transporter, and that of its closest paralog abcc <dig>  in the mode of action of cry <dig> proteins, their developmental expression and tissue distribution has been studied. they both were expressed in the larval midgut, in agreement with the expected characteristics from membrane proteins that must interact with cry <dig> proteins toxic to larvae. however, at early stages of development, when insects are more susceptible to b. thuringiensis, the expression levels of abcc <dig> are lower than those of abcc <dig>  suggesting that the latter may play a more relevant role in the mode of action of b. thuringiensis toxins. a more direct approach to the involvement of abcc <dig> and abcc <dig> in the toxicity of cry proteins was to measure the susceptibility to cry1ac and cry1ca in larvae where the expression of these two transporters had been decreased by feeding dsrna. with both toxins, mortality significantly decreased when the expression of either abcc <dig> or abcc <dig> was reduced. this result shows that both transporters are involved in the toxicity of these two cry <dig> proteins and that, in theory, mutations in either one could result in resistance to these two toxins. since the sequence homology between abcc <dig> and abcc <dig> is higher than 70%, it is likely that both proteins could serve as receptors for cry <dig> toxins. abcc <dig>  although not as similar to abcc <dig> as abcc <dig>  cannot be discarded at this point as also playing a role in the mode of action of b. thuringiensis. however, the most direct evidence of the involvement of abcc transporters in the mode of action of b. thuringiensis toxins in s. exigua is that resistant insects, but not susceptible controls, carried a mutated allele of the abcc <dig> gene.

all previous reports relating the abcc <dig> transporter to resistance to cry1a proteins have found mutations in the abcc <dig> gene that affected the extracellular domains in different ways. in h. virescens, the mutation consisted of a 22-bp deletion in exon  <dig>  which would result in a truncated product of  <dig> amino acids instead of the  <dig>  amino acids in the wild type protein  <cit> . in p. xylostella, the abcc <dig> gene had a 30-bp deletion in exon  <dig>  which was predicted to remove the final transmembrane domain with the result of positioning the c-terminal end of the protein in the extracellular space instead of its natural location inside the cell  <cit> . in b. mori, the mutation added an extra tyrosine residue in the second extracellular loop of the abcc <dig> transporter  <cit> . so far, the mutation in the abcc <dig> gene conferring resistance in t. ni has not yet been elucidated  <cit> . binding studies with the above resistant colonies showed that insects with the abcc <dig> mutation lacked binding of cry1ab and cry1ac in the case of h. virescens and p. xylostella <cit> . the same lack of binding of these two toxins was found in the t. ni resistant colony  <cit> . however, no apparent alteration of cry1ab binding  was found in the b. mori resistant insects as compared to susceptible controls  <cit> . as has been hypothesized elsewhere  <cit> , it is very likely that the extra tyrosine residue in the extracellular loop does not prevent binding of cry1ab, although it could confer resistance by altering the transporter function and decreasing the probability of the toxin being drawn into the membrane.

the mutation we have found in the s. exigua resistant insects is the first reported mutation that does not affect, directly or indirectly, the extracellular abcc <dig> domains, but affects the intracellular c-terminal part of the protein, which contains the second atp binding domain. if the above model of the involvement of the abcc <dig> transporter in the mode of action of cry <dig> toxins is correct, we should not expect any decrease in toxin binding since the extracellular domains of the protein are not altered, and the intracellular deletion does not seem to appreciably affect the conformation of the rest of the protein. similarly to b. mori, resistance would be conferred by altering the transporter function affecting its role in inserting the toxin into the membrane  <cit> . our binding data completely agree with this hypothesis. first, no significant difference was found regarding the affinity of the toxin to bind bbmv, and only a small difference was found between resistant and susceptible insects regarding the concentration of binding sites. second, alteration of the transporter ability to draw the toxin into the membrane would specifically affect the irreversible component of binding, and this is precisely what our results indicate. the involvement of the abcc <dig> transporter in the resistance to b. thuringiensis in s. exigua adds a new species in which the role of this gene in resistance to cry proteins has been demonstrated.

silencing of abcc <dig> and abcc <dig>  in addition to allowing us to confirm the role of these receptors in the mode of action of b. thuringiensis, has enabled the study of the fitness cost associated with the absence of these proteins. although dsrna feeding could not achieve complete knock-out of gene expression to emulate a resistance gene, partial silencing revealed clear effects on insect fitness. fitness cost has been associated with resistance in most of the b. thuringiensis resistant strains  <cit> . according to our results, field selection of abc-related resistance alleles can be counteracted by the reduced fitness of resistant insects versus susceptible insects in areas not exposed to b. thuringiensis products  and, in this way, contribute to delay the development of resistance.

previous studies on the xen-r strain revealed that the insects, in the absence of exposure to b. thuringiensis, had a high level of expression of certain genes  that are up-regulated in susceptible insects after b. thuringiensis intoxication  <cit> . for this reason we found it interesting to determine whether a decrease in the expression, or a malfunction, of the seabcc <dig> or seabbc <dig> transporters could trigger the up-regulation of such genes. our results reveal that silencing of seabcc <dig> or seabcc <dig>  in susceptible insects, induces the expression of arylphorin and repat <dig>  such a result suggests that higher expression levels of these genes in the xen-r insects are induced by the mutation in the seabcc <dig> receptor. additionally, up-regulation of these genes in response to b. thuringiensis intoxication might be induced by the interaction of the toxins with the abcc receptors, perhaps because binding of the toxin would probably block their physiological function. other studies have shown that arylphorin and repat <dig>  as well as other members of the repat superfamily, are induced in response to intoxication with several types of toxins in spodoptera spp. <cit> . it would be of interest to check whether other resistant strains with mutations in the abcc <dig> transporter overexpress these genes and to explore the possibility of using such a phenotype as a marker to monitor for the presence of abc-related mutations in the field.

also worth noting is the fact that the abcc <dig> mutation in s. exigua apparently confers resistance not only to cry1a proteins but to cry1ca as well. although xentari™ contains cry1a and cry1ca as major cry components  <cit> , s. exigua larvae are susceptible to cry1ca but relatively tolerant to cry1a proteins  <cit> . therefore, resistance to xentari™ in xen-r implies resistance to the cry1ca key component. another indirect piece of evidence that mutations in the abcc <dig> transporter may be involved in resistance to cry <dig> toxins other than those of the cry1a family was recently reported in p. xylostella <cit> . cry1a resistant insects with a mutation in the abcc <dig> gene were cross-resistant to cry1fa and they lacked binding of cry1a proteins and cry1fa to bbmv  <cit> . in this insect species, it was already known that cry1fa shares binding sites with cry1a proteins  <cit> .

fifteen abcc genes have been annotated on the b. mori genome  <cit> . it would be interesting to test whether additional members of such a family in lepidoptera, but also in other insect orders, could be involved in modulating the insect susceptibility to cry <dig> toxins and also to other groups of toxins, such as cry <dig> and cry <dig>  examples of membrane proteins that are known to serve as surrogate receptors for a wide variety of cry proteins are cadherin, apn and alp. all have been reported to be the binding proteins for quite different cry toxins, such as cry <dig>  cry <dig>  and cry <dig> and cry <dig>  which are active against lepidoptera, coleoptera and diptera, respectively  <cit> . it seems that different cry proteins have found the appropriate insect species, or even insect order, to interact with a same type of surrogate receptor.

CONCLUSIONS
bsa, based on high-throughput transcriptome sequencing, can be applied for genetic mapping in invertebrates. in this study, bsa has contributed to the identification of a novel type of mutation in the abcc <dig> transporter conferring high levels of insect resistance to b. thuringiensis. additional results have expanded the role of the abcc <dig> transporter in b. thuringiensis resistance beyond the cry1a family of proteins to include cry1ca and revealed the involvement of different members of the abcc family in the mode of action of b. thuringiensis and in the fitness-cost associated with the resistance to b. thuringiensis.
