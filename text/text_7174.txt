BACKGROUND
mitogen-activated protein kinase  cascades are conserved signaling modules in eukaryotes. they transduce external signals to intracellular responses via phosphorylation. mpk cascades contain three sequential types of protein kinases. these are mpks, mpk-activating kinases , and mkk/mek-activating kinases . genetic and biochemical analyses identified distinct mekk/mkk/mpk modules with overlapping functions in development, immunity, and abiotic stress responses . in addition to mkks, mpk activity is regulated by mpk phosphatases that dephosphorylate, and thereby inactivate their target mpks. by now, the identity of many mpk substrates and the nature of the mpk-substrate interaction have remained elusive, especially in plants. their disclosure is essential to understanding mekk/mkk/mpk-mediated cell signaling.

over the past decade, research on plant mpks focused on the large-scale identification of mpk substrate proteins. for example, protein and peptide microarrays were probed with recombinant mpks in the presence of radiolabeled atp to identify novel mpk substrate proteins . another in vitro screen used a synthetic peptide library that was incubated with purified kinases before phosphorylation site identification by mass spectrometry  <cit> . together, these screens revealed a large number of potential kinase-substrate relationships.

novel protocols in phosphoproteomics enable the enrichment even of low-abundant mpk substrate proteins thus making them accessible to mass spectrometry  <cit> . these protocols describe dual enrichment strategies that include the enrichment of phosphoproteins by al3-based metal-oxide affinity chromatography . the al3-based moac is either preceded by an ammonium-sulfate prefractionation step  <cit> , or followed by a specific enrichment of phosphopeptides using tio <dig>  we referred to the latter approach as tandem moac  <cit> . the tandem approach enables the direct recording of site-specific phosphorylation of several known and many unknown substrate candidate proteins of mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> in arabidopsis thaliana.

here, we verify selected, previously in vivo identified mpk substrate proteins of arabidopsis using a novel nonradioactive in vitro labeling assay for determining plant mpk substrate phosphorylation  <cit> . we use atpγs analogs that cannot enter the atp-binding pocket of a wild-type kinase, but can do so when the kinase’s atp-binding pocket is enlarged. these so-called analog-sensitive  kinases use bulky atpγs analogs as cofactors during catalysis. we engineered the proline-directed serine/threonine kinases mpk <dig>  mpk <dig>  and mpk <dig> of arabidopsis by mutating the gatekeeping amino acid in the atp-binding pocket of the appropriate kinases. the mutation enlarges the atp-binding pocket thus allowing the as kinase to catalyze thiophosphorylation of its substrate proteins. subsequent alkylation of thiophosphorylated serine and/or threonine residues provides a semisynthetic epitope for a monoclonal thiophosphate ester-specific  antibody  <cit> . in addition to verifying previously identified in vivo mpk3/ <dig> substrates in arabidopsis, we demonstrate that these mpk3/ <dig> substrates are poor substrates for the closely related arabidopsis mpk <dig>  <cit> .

RESULTS
arabidopsis mpks use atpγs to thiophosphorylate myelin basic protein
in conventional in vitro kinase assays, a kinase and its substrate are incubated in the presence of  or -labeled atp. upon incubation, 32p/33p-radiolabeled substrate is being detected as a measure for kinase activity or suitability of a protein or peptide to serve as a substrate for the kinase in question. to determine the in vitro activity of arabidopsis mpk <dig>  mpk <dig>  and mpk <dig> towards selected proteinaceous candidate substrates in the absence of radioactive labeling, we expressed mpk <dig>  mpk <dig>  and mpk <dig> as gst-fusions in escherichia coli. fusion proteins were purified and incubated, in catalyzing conditions, in the presence of the generic mpk substrate myelin basic protein   <cit> . mpk activity was ensured by phosphorylation of column-bound gst-mpks  using purified, constitutively active versions of upstream mkks in the presence of atp. gst-mpk <dig> and gst-mpk <dig> were activated with constitutively active mkk <dig> and mkk <dig> , whereas column-bound gst-mpk <dig> was activated by mkk1dd and mkk2dd. before elution of the gst-fused mpks, the column was extensively washed with buffer to remove any residual mkk. as controls we used equally treated kinase-death versions of mpk <dig>  mpk <dig>  and mpk <dig> . pre-incubation of mpk3kd/4kd/6kd with their appropriate upstream mkkdds induced dual phosphorylation of the tey motif in the activation loop of kinases, but did not stimulate mpk3kd/4kd/6kd to phosphorylate mbp . in contrast, on-column pre-incubation of wild-type mpks with their upstream mkkdds not only enhanced dual phosphorylation of the mpk’s tey motif, but it also strongly induced mpk3/4/ <dig> activity .fig.  <dig> mbp phosphorylation and thiophosphorylation by mpk3/4/ <dig>  a kinase activity assay of purified wild-type  and kinase-death  forms of mpk3/4/ <dig> with  and without  pre-phosphorylation by upstream mkks. b in vitro thiophosphorylation of mbp by wt and kd forms of mpk3/4/ <dig> in the presence  or absence  of atpγs. cbb: coomassie brilliant blue



next, we asked whether mpk3/4/ <dig> accept atpγs as a cofactor to thiophosphorylate their generic substrate mbp. we also wondered whether a commercial anti-tpe antibody can be used to detect thiophosphorylated substrate proteins of mpk3/4/ <dig>  to answer these questions, pre-phosphorylated wild-type and kinase-death versions of mpk3/4/ <dig> were incubated with mbp in the presence or absence of atpγs. after adding p-nitrobenzyl mesylate  for alkylating the potential thiophosphoryl group on mbp, the reaction mixture was subjected to standard western blotting analysis and immunodetection with anti-tpe antibody. no signal was detected in control reactions without atpγs, or when kinase-death mpks were used in the assay with atpγs . however, the anti-tpe antibody cross-reacted with mbp in reaction mixtures containing only active wild-type mpk3/4/ <dig> and atpγs . this result strongly suggested that mpk3/4/ <dig> all accept atpγs as a phosphoryldonor to thiophosporylate mbp and supposedly also other substrate proteins. it also disclosed that the commercial anti-tpe antibody can be used to detect thiophosphoryl groups on mpk3/4/ <dig> substrate proteins .

engineered arabidopsis as-mpks use n6-benzyl-atpγs as cofactor
next we asked whether as-mpk3/4/ <dig> would accept synthetic n6-benzyl-atpγs  as a thiophosphate donor to exclude thiophosphorylation of substrates by contaminating kinases and to also prevent substrates from potential autophosphorylation. earlier studies identified two tyrosine residues  as the gatekeeper amino acid in these two kinases  <cit> . to identify the gatekeeping residue in mpk <dig>  we built a 3d atomic structure of mpk <dig> and bn-adp . the model predicts an atomic clash of the large threonine- <dig>  amino acid residue in mpk <dig> with the bulky side chain of bn-adp . mutation of t <dig> to a smaller amino acid, such as alanine , would probably allow bn-atp to access the atp-binding site of mpk <dig> . thus, t <dig> seems to be the gatekeeper amino acid residue in arabidopsis mpk <dig> fig.  <dig> model of wild-type and mutant variants of mpk <dig> with bn-adp. a ribbon diagram of wild-type mpk <dig> with its ligands adp  and mg2+ . the backbone and amino acid side chain of t <dig> in mpk <dig> are highlighted in red and shown in stick mode. blue outlined rectangle highlights the atp-binding site of mpk <dig>  b close-up of bn-adp modeled into the atp-binding site of wild-type mpk <dig>  c same as in  but with mpk3t119a




to test our in silico model  in vitro, we purified gst-mpk3t119a that was expressed in e.coli. we also purified a mutant version of as-mpk <dig>  and as-mpk <dig>  that we had expressed in e. coli. first, the relative activity of these as kinases to phosphorylate mbp was compared to the activity of their appropriate wild-type versions in the presence of either  atp  or atpγs . mutation of y <dig> to alanine did not affect  mpk4’s ability to use  atp  or atpγs . mpk6y144a phosphorylated mbp to an about same  or slightly lower extent  than the mpk <dig> wild-type protein. mpk3t119a also catalyzed mbp phosphorylation which was lower  or somewhat higher  than it was with the wild type.fig.  <dig> activity of as-mpks and inhibition by na-pp <dig>  a activity assay of wild-type and as variants of mpk3/4/ <dig> with mbp as substrate and  atp as cofactor. b same as in  but with atpγs as cofactor in the substrate labeling reaction. c same as in  but with bn-atpγs as cofactor. d activity assay of as-mpk3/4/ <dig> with mbp as substrate and bn-atpγs as cofactor in the presence  or absence  of na-pp1



in another set of experiments, the ability of as-mpk3/4/ <dig> to use bn-atpγs as a cofactor during catalysis was tested in in vitro substrate labeling assays . wild-type mpk3/4/ <dig> did not use bn-atpγs as a thiophosphate donor, whereas all as kinases used the bio-orthogonal bn-atpγs analog to thiophosphorylate mbp .

as-mpks can be specifically inhibited by purine analogs that do not affect the activity of wild-type kinases. for example, previous studies revealed that 4-amino-1-tert-butyl-3-pyrazolopyrimidine  specifically inhibits as kinases but not their appropriate wild-type kinase because its bulkier side chain prevents na-pp <dig> from accessing the atp-binding pocket of wild-type kinases  <cit> . consistent with this as-mpk3/4/ <dig> seem to be sensitive to na-pp <dig> because na-pp <dig> addition to the substrate labeling reaction completely abolished mpk3t119a, mpk4y124a, and mpk6y144a activity .

site-specific phosphorylation of mpk targets by in vitro substrate labeling
next, we used in vitro substrate labeling reactions with active as-mpk3/4/ <dig> to verify previously identified in vivo mpk3/ <dig> substrates and their target phosphorylation sites. we randomly selected four mpk3/6-specific in vivo substrates which we identified by tandem moac in previous work  <cit> : two proteins of unknown function , a putative translation initiation factor , and pirl <dig>  a member of the plant intracellular ras group-related leucine-rich repeat  proteins . in addition to the wild-type version of proteins, we cloned phosphosite mutants in which the previously recorded phosphorylated serine and/or threonine residues were mutated to alanine. flag-tagged wild-type and mutant proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-flag agarose resin after successful in vitro translation in wheat germ extracts. while bound to the affinity gel, proteins were incubated with active as-mpk3/4/ <dig> or the appropriate wild-type form of kinase in the presence of bn-atpγs. as shown in fig.  <dig>  wild-type at1g <dig>  at2g <dig>  and at4g <dig> were phosphorylated by all three mpks. however, in contrast to mpk3/ <dig>  these proteins seem to be only weakly phosphorylated by mpk4y124a . at3g <dig> is a good substrate of mpk3/ <dig> but not phosphorylated by mpk <dig> . in most cases, mutation of previously identified phosphosites in the investigated proteins strongly reduced the extent of phosphorylation by mpk3/4/ <dig> in vitro. these findings indicate that the previously identified serine/threonine residues are specifically targeted by mpk3/ <dig> and to a lesser extent by mpk <dig> fig.  <dig> in vitro labeling assay of wild-type and mutated mpk substrates. a thiophosphorylation assays of native  and phosphosite mutant  forms of flag-tagged mpk substrates at1g <dig>  at2g <dig>  at3g <dig> and at4g <dig> in the presence of bn-atpγs as cofactor and using either as-mpk <dig> or wt-mpk <dig> as a negative control. b same as in  but using as-mpk <dig> and wt-mpk <dig>  c same as in  but using as-mpk <dig> and wt-mpk4



the results in fig.  <dig> indicated that at1g <dig>  at2g <dig>  at3g <dig>  and at4g <dig> are good substrates for mpk3/ <dig> but are not, or only weakly phosphorylated by mpk <dig>  to directly compare the potential of mpk3/4/ <dig> to phosphorylate the four proteins, we repeated the substrate labeling reactions with all three mpks . we tested the wild-type version of at1g <dig>  at2g <dig>  at3g <dig>  and at4g <dig> and loaded the samples of each of these proteins in combination with mpk3/4/ <dig> on a separate gel. the results of this experiment support the previous finding arguing that the assayed proteins represent good substrates of mpk3/ <dig>  but are marginally phosphorylated by mpk <dig>  to exclude the possibility that the lower level of phosphorylation of these mpk3/ <dig> substrates by mpk <dig> is due to a lower in vitro activity of mpk <dig>  we expressed and purified the known mpk <dig> substrate map kinase substrate  <dig>  from e. coli, and found that mks <dig> was equally well phosphorylated by mpk3/ <dig> and  <dig>   <cit> . together, these data verify at1g <dig>  at2g <dig>  at3g <dig>  and at4g <dig> as substrate proteins of mpk3/ <dig>  and they suggest specificity in the in vitro substrate-labeling reactions.fig.  <dig> substrate preference of mpk3/4/ <dig>  a thiophosphorylation assays of native, flag-tagged at1g <dig>  at2g <dig>  at3g <dig> and at4g <dig> in the presence of bn-atpγs as cofactor and using either as-mpk3/4/ <dig> or wt-mpk3/4/ <dig> as a negative control. b same as in  but using e. coli expressed t7-tagged mks <dig> as a substrate. sample wells that were left empty are indicated by an asterisk 



specificity of the in vitro substrate labeling assay
arabidopsis mpks are not only related in sequence but they also share substrates  <cit> . substrate overlaps have been reported mainly for mpk <dig> and mpk <dig>  but also for mpk <dig> and mpk <dig>  to analyze the specificity of the in vitro substrate labelling reaction, we first examined whether the mutation of the gatekeeper amino acids of mpk3/4/ <dig> to alanine leads to a change in substrate selectivity. therefore we compared substrate specificity of wild-type versus as-mpks in in vitro labelling reactions containing atpγs. as mpk-substrates we chose two members of the vq-motif-containing protein family, the mpk3/ <dig> substrate vq <dig>  and the well described mpk4-specific substrate mks <dig>   <cit> . whereas as-mpk <dig> and wild-type mpk <dig> could only markedly thiophosphorylate mks <dig>  both vq <dig> and mks <dig> were thiophosphorylated by wild-type and mutated mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> . thus these results indicate that mutation of the gatekeeper amino acid to alanine does not influence substrate specificity of mpk3/4/ <dig>  in a final experiment, to compare the substrate preference of as-mpk <dig>  as-mpk <dig>  and as-mpk <dig> using bio-orthogonal bn-atpγs, we again tested vq <dig> and mks <dig> but also included the mpk3/6-specific substrate at1g <dig>  <cit> . the three mpk substrates were expressed and purified from e. coli as native his6-tagged fusion proteins with an additional n-terminal t <dig> epitope for immunodetection. to evaluate the substrate preference of as-mpk <dig>  as-mpk <dig>  and as-mpk <dig> we performed in vitro labeling assays using equal amounts of the above mentioned protein substrates. the samples were loaded on a same gel to allow for the direct comparison of signal intensities. consistent with the results in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  the unknown protein at1g <dig> was well phosphorylated by mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> and only weakly by mpk <dig> . likewise, vq <dig>  a specific mpk3/ <dig> substrate protein  <cit>  also was only weakly phosphorylated by mpk <dig> . in contrast, the known mpk <dig> substrate mks <dig> was not only phosphorylated by mpk <dig>  as previously reported  <cit> , but is equally well phosphorylated by mpk3/ <dig> . this result shows that by including known substrates of the three major plant map kinases as positive controls on the same gel, the in vitro labeling reactions enable assessment of the specificity of kinase-substrate interactions.fig.  <dig> comparison of substrate specificity of wild-type and as-mpks. thiophosphorylation assays of t7-tagged vq <dig> and mks <dig> in the presence of atpγs as cofactor and using wild-type, as-mpk, and kd-mpk versions of mpk3/4/6

discussion and conclusions 
traditional in vitro kinase assays employ kinases, their substrates and γ-32p or γ-33p-labeled atp. nowadays, the radiolabeled nucleotide can be substituted by non-radioactive atpγs resulting in thiophosphorylation of the kinase substrate. following alkylation with pnbm, the thiophosphorylated substrate can be detected by western blotting analysis and immunodetection with an anti-tpe antibody  <cit> . specific substrate labeling is achieved by engineering the kinase of interest to accept bulky atpγs analogs that, because of steric hindrance cannot be used by naive kinases. until now, this approach for studying kinase-substrate interactions in vitro has not been applied in plant biology research. we used the approach to show that as-mpk3/4/ <dig> are able to use bn-atpγs to thiophosphorylate substrates, and that there is specificity in these in vitro reactions. in addition, we validated the phosphorylation of previously identified in vivo mpk3/ <dig> protein substrates, and we demonstrated that these substrates are rather poor substrates for mpk <dig> 

the substrate thiophosphorylation assay is simple, effective, and has high sensitivity. it does not need work with hazardous material or problematic waste disposal. another advantage of using as kinases and bio-orthogonal atp-analogs is the specificity of the kinase-substrate interaction. this is of particular relevance when  the kinase reaction is performed with substrate proteins of suboptimal purity,  when an additional upstream activating kinase is required for the reaction, or  if the putative substrate is a protein with kinase activity. the latter is true, for example, for the mpk3/6-specific substrate pirl <dig>    <cit> . using as kinases and atp analogs thus avoids the undesired detection of such autophosphorylation and/or phosphorylation by contaminating kinases in the reaction mixture.

until now, as kinases have been widely exploited when studying cell signaling in yeast and mammals  <cit> . in arabidopsis, as-mpk <dig> or as-mpk <dig> were used to genetically complement the mpk <dig> or mpk <dig> mutant  <cit> . the authors mutated the gatekeeper amino acid to glycine. the exchange leads to a specific inhibition of the kinases in vivo upon application of na-pp <dig>  in the present work, we for the first time applied as-mpk3/4/ <dig> in substrate labeling reactions. since glycine lacks an amino acid side chain, it often causes a sharp turn of the polypeptide backbone  <cit>  and, thus, may result in a collapse of the atp-binding pocket and the associated loss of kinase activity. by contrast, introducing an alanine at the gatekeeper position not only preserved the enzyme activity , and substrate specificity  of as-mpk3/4/ <dig>  but also maintained the possibility to block their activity by binding of na-pp <dig> in the enlarged active site pocket .

our previous work identified in vivo mpk target proteins using tandem-moac combined with dexamethasone-inducible expression of a constitutively active tobacco mpk-kinase  in arabidopsis  <cit> . ntmek <dig> phosphorylates and thus activates arabidopsis mpk <dig> and mpk <dig>  <cit> . however, we cannot exclude that the activity of other mpks is affected as well in these plants. here, we validated in vitro that at2g <dig>  at1g <dig>  at4g <dig>  and at3g <dig> are phosphorylated by mpk3/ <dig>  but are poor substrates for arabidopsis mpk <dig> . except for at2g <dig>  knocking out the phosphorylation-targeted residue by site-directed mutagenesis of the serine or threonine amino acid within the serine-proline or threonine-proline dipeptide motif resulted in a major decrease in the phosphorylation of these proteins . however, besides the identified phosphorylation site of at2g <dig>  the protein contains eight additional putative mpk phosphorylation sites suggesting that mpk3/ <dig> might target additional phosphosites in at2g <dig> . together, these findings disclose the power of our tandem-moac analyses and the high confidence of phosphosite localization probability. to assess substrate preferences, we not only assayed mpk3/4/ <dig> phosphorylation of each substrate independently , but we also directly compared phosphorylation of several substrates by any of these mpks . consistent with results in other laboratories, mks <dig> is a good substrate for mpk <dig>   <cit> . however, based on our data we conclude that mks <dig> also is a good substrate for mpk3/ <dig>  which contrast recent reports by sörensson et al.  and pecher et al.   <cit> .

methods
cloning and site-directed mutagenesis
coding regions of mpk <dig>  mpk <dig>  and mpk <dig> were amplified by pcr, ligated in frame into pgex5x- <dig> vector  and sequenced. mkk <dig>  mkk <dig>  mkk <dig>  mkk <dig>  mks <dig>  vq <dig> and at1g <dig>  were cloned into petλhis  <cit>  using restriction enzymes listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> and transformed into e. coli bl <dig>  coding regions of the mpk substrates at2g <dig>  at1g <dig>  at4g <dig>  and at3g <dig> were amplified by pcr and cloned into pjet <dig>  . site-directed mutagenesis  was performed either by double joint pcr as described  <cit>  or using the quickchangeii site-directed mutagenesis kit .

radioactive kinase activity assay
radioactive kinase assays were performed as described  <cit> . briefly, 100 ng recombinant active gst-mpk <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> were mixed with 3 μg mbp in kinase reaction buffer  with 25 μm atp and -atp . after  <dig> mins, the reaction was stopped by adding sds loading buffer. the phosphorylation of mbp was visualized after sds-page by autoradiography. loading of mbp was visualized by pageblue™ protein staining solution .

substrate labeling reactions
substrate labeling reactions were performed as described  <cit> . in brief, 100 ng recombinant active gst-mpks were mixed either with 3 μg mbp, 1 μg recombinant t7-tagged mpk substrate, or 10 μl immunoprecipitated flag-tagged substrates in kinase reaction including either 1 mm atpγs  or 1 mm n6-bn-atpγs . for immunocomplex substrate labeling, in vitro translated flag-tagged proteins were immunopreciptated with 40 μl ezviewtm red anti-flag m <dig> affinity gel  according to manufacturer’s instructions. while still binding the flag-tagged substrate, the affinity gel was washed twice with kinase buffer and the resin was resuspended in 40 μl kinase buffer. for each substrate labeling reaction 10 μl of the bead suspension was used. the reaction was stopped by adding 20 mm edta after 1 h and the thiophosphorylated substrate was alkylated with  <dig>  mm pnbm  in 5 %  dmso for 2 h. the alkylation reaction was stopped by adding sds loading buffer. samples were subjected to sds-page, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane , and used for immunodetection as described  <cit> . primary rabbit antibodies against the thiophosphatester  were used for detection of thiophosphorylation. the anti-phospho-p44/ <dig> mpk  antibody, which detects doubly phosphorylated mpk3/4/ <dig>  was from new england biolabs. rabbit anti-t <dig>  and mouse monoclonal anti-flag m <dig>  epitope antibodies served as loading control of flag-tagged and t7-tagged mpk substrates. rabbit anti-gst  antibodies were used to check equal amounts of kinase in each reaction. antigen-antibody complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies  followed by chemiluminescence detection with luminata crecendo hrp substrate . using independent protein preparations, all substrate labelling reactions were repeated at least twice with similar results.
