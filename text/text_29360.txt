BACKGROUND
epigenetics involves information retained during cell division other than dna sequence per se, and both dna methylation and post-translational modifications of histones are fundamental in understanding normal development and disease  <cit> . genome-scale localization of histone modifications had been extensively mapped in mammalian genomes  <cit> . while most of these studies focused on local regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers, global organization of the chromatin has not been well understood.

recent evidence indicates that repressive histone modifications form large scale domains in both mouse and human genomes. we had previously identified large blocks of h <dig> lysine  <dig> dimethylation , termed large organized chromatin k9-modifications , which affect more than 40% of the mouse genome in liver cells  <cit> . locks significantly overlap with lamina-associated domains   <cit>  and are associated with domain-wide gene silencing in a tissue-specific manner. importantly, both coverage and domain size of locks increase upon differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells   <cit> . on the other hand, genome-scale reduction of locks was seen in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition  induced by tgf-β treatment of mouse hepatocytes, a process in which cells gain stem cell-like and malignant-type traits  <cit> . similarly, large blocks of other repressive marks  are also found to expand in human lung fibroblasts compared with human escs  <cit> , and those blocks/locks expand in breast cancer cells relative to normal epithelial cells  <cit> . furthermore, large h3k9me <dig> and h4k20me <dig> blocks specifically coat olfactory receptor  gene clusters in mouse olfactory epithelium but not in liver  <cit> . taken together, these data demonstrate that large heterochromatin domains are highly dynamic in differentiation and tumorigenesis.

dna methylation has been tightly linked to development and disease  <cit> . we previously reported that differentially methylated regions  related to tissue specificity , colon cancer  and reprogramming  have largely common targets in the genome and are strongly associated with local regulation of adjacent genes  <cit> . whole genome bisulfite sequencing had found partial methylated domains  which are highly methylated in human escs but partially methylated in fibroblasts  <cit> . similar large hypomethylation blocks relative to normal cells have been identified in colon cancer  <cit>  and breast cancer cells  <cit> , and loss of methylation in these regions is accompanied by acquisition of large domains of h3k9me <dig> and h3k27me <dig>  <cit> .

surprisingly, the relationship of h3k9me <dig> locks/blocks to dmrs has not been previously assessed. in the course of this investigation, we identified a new chromatin unit we term “euchromatin island” which may serve as a fulcrum between dna methylation and chromatin in development.

RESULTS
we analyzed whole genome distribution of h3k9me <dig> by chip-chip using a highly specific monoclonal antibody in two human pluripotent stem cell  lines  and three primary differentiated cell lines: human astrocytes , human aortic endothelial cells  and human pulmonary fibroblasts . for differentiated cells, we used early passages of primary cells instead of immortalized cell lines to avoid potentially aberrant epigenetic changes due to long time cell culture and immortalization of the cells  <cit> . these differentiated lines represent three germ layers: ectoderm , mesoderm  and endoderm .

we normalized the chip-chip data as described  <cit>  to calculate the log <dig> ratios of chip/input comparable among cell types. by using the 90th quantile as a cutoff to define large domains, the genome coverage of locks was found to increase from  <dig> -24% in psc lines, to  <dig> - <dig> % in differentiated cells, and the average sizes of lock expanded from 142– <dig> kb in psc lines, to 233– <dig> kb in the differentiated. the trends were the same when we used different cutoffs to define locks , consistent with our previous findings that locks increase after mouse esc differentiation  <cit> . for example, in the wscd <dig> gene locus, only some small h3k9me <dig> peaks can be seen in the pscs, but the h3k9me <dig> enriched regions expanded to ~ <dig> kb long and cover the whole gene body and its flanking regions in the differentiated cells .

to validate the chip-chip data, we performed quantitative pcr  on  <dig> loci using independently prepared chip and input dna samples from four cell types. for all the cases, the quantitative differences of h3k9me <dig> enrichments within and among samples detected by chip-chip were well validated by qpcr . overall, the chip/input log <dig> ratios of microarray  and qpcr were strongly correlated , indicating that the chip-chip data are of high quality.

to reveal the relationship between dynamics of h3k9me <dig> and dna methylation on a large scale, we compared genome-wide distributions of locks , pmds in fibroblasts  <cit> , and dna hypomethylation blocks in colon cancer  <cit> . locks in fibroblasts  largely overlap pmds , and overall  <dig> % regions of locks in hpf coincide with pmds , and h3k9me <dig> signals in the regions of pmds are higher than non-pmd regions . furthermore, more than 80% lock regions in hpf were contained within dna hypomethylation blocks found in colon cancer tissues . thus, our data support a strong correlation between locks and dna hypomethylation blocks in human cells.

on closer examination of the microstructure of the locks, we noticed that many small h3k9me2-depleted regions are located in the body of locks. these regions are a few kb in length, and away from the lock boundaries. we found that these regions are abundant in the genome, and they appear to be associated with open chromatin . thus, we termed these regions euchromatin islands . as an example, an ei was found near the transcription start sites  of the cadherin  <dig> gene , of which epigenetic disruption was associated with metastasis of human cancers  <cit> . other examples of eis include within the gene body of pdilt, a testis-specific gene; and downstream of the glycoprotein  <dig>  gene .

then we developed a statistical algorithm to identify eis genome-wide . we identified  <dig> to  <dig>  eis across cell types, with average sizes from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb . these eis form strong dips relative to adjacent lock regions as demonstrated by average h3k9me <dig> densities . we have performed replicates on one array of the “mouse chip-chip  <dig> m whole-genome tiling sets”, which covers 10% of the genome. the eis detected from the replicate experiments have high concordance with the ones from whole genome arrays . percentage of eis detected from whole genome arrays that can also be detected from replicate arrays are  <dig> % for h <dig>   <dig> % for ada- <dig>   <dig> % for ha,  <dig> % for haec and  <dig> % for hpf. to exclude the possibility that eis resulted from lack of histones in these regions, we plotted nucleosome density around eis, and no depletion of nucleosomes was observed in eis , indicating that the observation of eis is not due to nucleosome positioning.

a  <dig> kb up and downstream of tss overlapping eis; b enrichment compared to random patterns; c p values calculated by  <dig>  permutations.

among the five cell lines,  <dig> % to  <dig> % of eis coincided with transcriptional start sites , which associated with  <dig> to  <dig> genes across cell types. compared to random, the enrichment at tss ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  , with randomization p-values < 10- <dig> for all cell lines . we further investigated the spatial relationship between ei and cpg islands . we found that  <dig> % to 17% of eis overlapped with cgis, with enrichment ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the randomization test suggested that eis significantly overlapped with cgi in differentiated cells, but not in es and ips cells .

to probe the chromatin features of eis, we compared locations of eis in h <dig>  haec and hpf with public datasets of comparable cell lines  <cit> . interestingly, eis highly coincide with regions interacting with ccctc-binding factor , the major organizer of higher-order chromatin in mammalian genomes . overall, up to  <dig> % of eis overlap with ctcf binding regions, which are  <dig> -fold enriched compared with the random pattern . furthermore, up to 49% of eis overlap with dnase hypersensitive sites , the hallmark of open chromatin, which is  <dig> -fold enrichment compared with the random . we further explored the overlaps of eis with other histone modifications, and found that eis highly overlaps with h3k4me <dig>  and h3k9ac , but less enrich for h3k27me <dig>  and h3k36me <dig> . the enrichments are similar among the three cell types. in addition, we investigated the enrichment by comparing eis with random pattern within lock regions, and got similar results and even stronger enrichments for ctcf .

a eis of haec, h <dig> and hpf were compared with chromatin marks of huvec, h <dig> and normal lung fibroblasts, respectively .

bp values were calculated by  <dig> permutations.

cenrichment is calculated as the ratio of observed to random.

we then asked whether there is any association between eis and dmrs. for this purpose, we compared genomic locations of eis with dmrs identified by charm array  <cit> . we found that eis are highly enriched for dmrs distinguishing tissue types . for example, eis near tsss of nitric oxide synthase  <dig> , xylosyltransferase i  and heparan sulfate  3-o-sulfotransferase  <dig>  all overlap t-dmrs . overall, a large fraction of eis  overlap with t-dmrs, with enrichment from  <dig>  to  <dig>  folds relative to random patterns .

notes: en. = enrichment. statistical significances were tested by  <dig> permutations.

we further tested the relationship between eis and dmrs associated with reprogramming . similar to t-dmrs, r-dmrs were more methylated in ipsc cells compared to fibroblasts  were also significantly enriched in eis of all the cell types, whose enrichments ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold. however, r-dmrs less methylated in ipsc cells  were highly enriched in eis of differentiated cells , but much less enriched in pscs . importantly, eis in hpf, the same cell type of parental cells in reprogramming, are strongly enriched for hypomethylated r-dmrs , whereas those in ipscs did not significantly overlap with hypomethylated r-dmrs , indicating a coordinated hypomethylation in these eis during reprogramming.

we then compared ei locations with colon cancer-associated dmrs  and observed an opposite trend to that of r-dmrs. eis in  <dig> out of  <dig> cell lines were significantly enriched for c-dmrs more methylated in colon cancers , and the enrichment ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold . in contrast, all five cells types were not significantly enriched for c-dmrs less methylated in cancers . these results were further confirmed by comparing eis with an independent list of c-dmrs discovered by whole genome bisulfite sequencing  <cit> . eis of all five cell lines significantly overlapped hypermethylated c-dmrs , whereas none of them were significantly enriched for hypomethylated c-dmrs . interestingly, almost all eis  that associated with hypermethylated c-dmrs also overlap cgis. these data suggest that eis in normal cells may become hypermethylated in cancers.

to explore the biological role of eis, we compared expression levels of genes associated with eis, of genes with locks but not eis, and of genes not overlapping locks . it is clear that expressions of genes overlapping eis are significantly higher than those of within locks but not eis . to further test whether ei associated genes are regulated by other histone marks, we investigated the relationship between h3k36me3/h3k27me <dig> and genes with eis, with locks and without locks . in either category , genes at lock regions always have the lowest expression and genes at non-lock regions have the highest. however, genes with eis have expressions in the middle, and positively  associated with h3k36me <dig> , indicating that ei related genes could be regulated by these two marks.

then we conducted gene ontology  analysis with genes whose tsss are associated with eis. ei-associated genes in differentiated cells were strongly associated with 1) biological processes such as system development, cell adhesion and cell differentiation; 2) cellular compartments of plasma membrane and synapse, and 3) molecular function of ion binding and channel activity .

finally, to test whether eis are associated with specific cellular functions, we compared the location of eis among the three differentiated cell lines. based on our current strategy to define eis, ~50% of them are cell type specific . it should be noted that the detection of ei is based on the definition of locks as well as the amount of reduction of h3k9me <dig> levels within lock bodies. some tissue specific eis may be due to differential locks or different amount of h3k9me <dig> reductions among cell types. due to these reasons the number of tissue specific eis is likely an over-estimate. new technology with higher resolution and dynamic range, such as chip-seq, will help achieve better accuracy and specificity in tissue comparisons. nevertheless, we found that some tissue specific eis are biologically meaningful. for example, an ei is located near the tss of down syndrome cell adhesion molecule gene  in astrocytes  but not the other two cell types . it was shown that dscam diversity is essential for neuronal circuit assembly  <cit> , and genetic variations of this gene were associated with down syndrome and congenital heart disease   <cit>  and bipolar disorder  <cit> . furthermore, an ei is found on the 5’ end of myocardin  gene in ha and hpf but haec . myocardin is a coactivator of serum response factor which specifically expressed in cardiac and smooth muscle cells  <cit> , and promoter variation of this gene was proposed as a biomarker of cardiac hypertrophy  <cit> . these data suggest that eis may be important in regulating specific cellular functions.

discussion
in summary, by examining the genome-wide distribution of h3k9me <dig> in human pscs and differentiated cells, we found a novel microstructure within heterochromatin domains of thousands of small euchromatin islands  located within large h3k9me <dig> blocks . eis are strongly associated with open chromatin regions , active chromatin marks  and higher-order chromatin organizers . furthermore, eis are highly enriched for dmrs associated with tissue specificity , reprogramming  and cancers . this association is particularly strong for hypomethylated r-dmrs and hypermethylated c-dmrs. genes associated with eis are enriched for annotations of system development, cellular differentiation and cell adhesion. these results suggested that eis may coordinate higher order chromatin and mediate co-regulation of dna methylation in reprogramming and tumorigenesis. however, further experimental work is needed to address the functional relevance of eis and their strong association with ctcf and dmrs.

in this study, we compared h3k9me <dig> profiles with publicly available epigenomic data generated from similar cell types. this strategy may lead to biased estimation of the enrichments of eis with other epigenetic marks, because patterns of eis may be different between the two samples. comparison of exactly matched cell lines and cultures could assess the association between them more accurately.

note that a previous literature used the term “euchromatic islands” in a completely different context, simply to describe chromatin regions with h3k4me <dig> and cpg islands, essentially describing promoter regions of active genes  <cit> . as that term was rarely used previously, and to convey a completely different meaning, we do not think there will be confusion with our newly defined  “euchromatin islands” or eis, namely h3k9me <dig> depleted regions/islands within an ocean of heterochromatin , enriched for regulatory elements such as enhancers  and insulators . thus, eis are novel units of the genomic “tool box” which may be important in epigenetic regulation as suggested by their strong association with dmrs .

higher-order organization of the genome remains a highly active area to be explored. recent evidence indicates the presence of spatial compartments of active and repressive chromatin domains as general principles of genome organization in mammalian cells  <cit> , and ctcf mediates intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions by tethering chromatin regions binding ctcf  <cit> . it would be interesting to explore the possibility that euchromatin islands act as “anchors” for the interactions among heterochromatin domains or between heterochromatic and enchromatic regions. moreover, the relationships between eis and heterochromatin formation, and the biophysical features of eis are interesting questions for future investigation.

although evidence provided in this and other studies have indicated that large heterochromatin domains are highly dynamic in stem cell differentiation and tumorigenesis  <cit> , lienert et al. indicated that genome coverage of h3k9me <dig> domains do not increase globally during neuronal differentiation of mouse es cells  <cit> . first of all, lineage specificity of differentiated cells may explain the conflicts. as reported in our earlier work  <cit>  the amount of locks detected from brain and es cells are comparable , whereas the amount is very high in liver . the lienert study used in vitro differentiated neurons as differentiated cells which is more similar to brain. furthermore, the inconsistence may be due to sensitivities of different statistical methods for finding large domains, heterogenenity of stem cells, and so on. notably, extensive deduction of locks during emt suggested that quantitative differences of these large domains may be functionally important  <cit> . nevertheless, further studies on homogenous stem cell populations may be helpful to address these debates. whatever it holds, functionally investigations of these large domains should provide important insight toward how higher-order chromatin affects normal development and disease.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have explored the microstructure of locks and indentified thousands of euchromatin islands , which may be served as a finer layer of epigenomic architecture within large heterochromatin domains. the strong association of eis with ctcf sites, dnase hypersensitivies sites, and dmrs suggests that eis play an important role in normal epigenomic architecture and its disruption in disease.
