BACKGROUND
stat <dig>  is the founder member of the stat family of transcription factors and plays a critical role in interferon  regulated gene responses. ifn-γ activates stat <dig> through janus kinase -mediated phosphorylation of tyr <dig>  activated stat <dig> homodimerizes and translocates to the nucleus where it binds to dna and initiates transcription of ifn-γ-regulated genes  <cit> . the x-ray structure  of the dna-bound stat <dig> dimer shows a contiguous c-shaped clamp around dna, that is mediated by specific interactions between the sh <dig> domain and the tyrosine  phosphorylated c-terminal tail segment  of the monomers  <cit> .

small ubiquitin-like modifier  proteins belong to the family of ubiquitin-like protein modifiers, collectively termed ubls, that are covalently attached to substrate proteins by a cascade of enzymatic reactions  <cit> . the conjugation is regulated by distinct sumo specific enzymes such as e <dig> activating enzyme aos1/uba <dig> and the e <dig> conjugase ubc <dig>  the protein inhibitor of activated stat  family of proteins, pias <dig>  pias <dig>  piasx and piasy have been shown to function as e3-type ligases to promote sumo conjugation to the target proteins  <cit> . pias <dig> functions as a negative regulator of stat1-mediated transcription through interaction with the dimerized stat <dig> and by inhibiting stat <dig> dna-binding  <cit> . interestingly, pias proteins have also been shown to promote sumoylation of stat <dig> at single lys <dig> amino acid residue within the sumo consensus sequence  702ikte <dig> in the c-terminal region of stat <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, it has been shown that mitogen activated protein kinase -induced phosphorylation of ser <dig> in stat <dig> promotes interaction of stat <dig> with pias <dig> and leads to enhanced stat <dig> sumoylation  <cit> .

several studies suggest that sumoylation has a negative effect on stat1-mediated gene responses  <cit> . sumoylation site lys <dig> is in a close proximity to tyr <dig> that is required for stat <dig> activation, and sumoylation has been shown to directly inhibit stat <dig> tyr <dig> phosphorylation  <cit> . sumoylation has also been shown to prevent condensation of stat <dig> oligomers in the nuclear paracrystals, and thereby increase the solubility of stat <dig> and promote its dephosphorylation  <cit> . recently, it was discovered that in addition to human stat <dig>  also murine stat <dig> and drosophila stat92e are regulated through sumo conjugation, confirming that sumoylation has an evolutionary conserved role in regulation of the cytokine signaling  <cit> .

this study was aimed to investigate the mechanism by which sumoylation regulates stat <dig> activity. inspection of molecular model indicates that sumo consensus site is well exposed in stat <dig> dimer, and it is accessible for propitious interactions with regulatory proteins. the constructed molecular model of sumo- <dig> conjugated stat <dig> dimer further suggested that sumo- <dig> moiety is oriented towards dna, thus able to affect the dna-binding properties of stat <dig> with its presence. the molecular model was supported by experimental evidence, and oligoprecipitation experiments indicated that sumoylation deficient stat <dig> e705q mutant display higher dna-binding activity on stat <dig> target gene promoters when compared to stat <dig> wild-type . furthermore, sumoylation deficient stat <dig> mutant showed enhanced histone h <dig> acetylation at the gbp- <dig> promoter.

for the binding assay, a biotinylated oligonucleotide containing the gas from the human gbp- <dig> gene  or stat <dig> binding site from human irf- <dig> gene  promoter was annealed and  <dig> nmols of biotinylated oligonucleotide duplex were rotated for  <dig> hours at 4°c with neutravidin agarose to form gas-agarose affinity beads. diluted cell extracts were precleared with neutravidin beads and then incubated with gas-agarose affinity beads for  <dig> hours in rotator at 4°c. the beads were then washed four times with buffer containing  <dig> % triton x- <dig>   <dig> mm hepes ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm edta,  <dig> mm egta,  <dig> mm kcl, 10% glycerol and  <dig> mm naf. gas-agarose affinity bead-bound proteins were subjected to sds-page and detected by immunoblotting with phospho-tyrosine -specific stat <dig> antibody . the western blot membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-ha antibody  to detect total amount of dna-bound stat <dig>  detected bands were quantified by using imagej image analysis software and analyzed after background subtraction.

chromatin immunoprecipitation
stable u3a-stat <dig> wt-ha and u3a-stat <dig> k703r-ha clones were starved and left unstimulated or stimulated with ifn-γ for 1h. chromatin immunoprecipitation  was performed as previously described  <cit>  using anti-acetyl-histone h <dig> antibody  or as a control, anti-igg antibody . dna was analyzed for human gbp- <dig> promoter by quantitative-rt-pcr with the following primers: 5’-agcttctggttgagaaatcttt-3’ and 5’-ccctggactaatatttcactg-3’. quantitative-pcr was done using sybr green i kit  according to manufacturer’s instructions. the values from chip assays were normalized to the total input dna.

molecular modeling
a 3d-structure of stat <dig> dimer with dna has been built using crystal structure of tyrosine phosphorylated stat1-dna complex   <cit> . the molecular geometry of the loop 684– <dig> in the sh <dig> domain was calculated using the program sybyl with amber  <dig> ff <dig> force field parameters. the initial model for the loop region was constructed using the crossover loop structure from the sumo-1-tdg   <cit>  as a template. first, during the energy and geometry minimization for the loop all hydrogen atoms and non-constraints were included in the protocol. second, during the molecular dynamic refinement the constraints were on for outer part of the loop in the sh <dig> domain. after the loop modeling we used the deposited coordinates of sumo- <dig>   <cit>  in our model. the sumo- <dig> was set nearby the constructed loop 684– <dig> so that its c-terminal residue  is in the vicinity of the lys <dig> of the stat <dig> and the loop can form a new β-strand to an existing antiparallel β- sheet structure in the sumo- <dig>  the loop 684– <dig> was also modeled with insightii . the entire structure was then subjected to energy minimization using the molecular mechanics force field cvff  and the steepest descent algorithm implemented under insight ii discover program. during the minimization, the dna and the atoms of the stat <dig> residues 136– <dig> and 700– <dig> were fixed.

RESULTS
senp <dig> deconjugates sumo- <dig> from stat <dig> and enhances stat1-mediated gene expression
the covalent modification of proteins by sumo- <dig> is known to be a reversible process  <cit> . we wanted to confirm the effect of sumoylation of stat <dig> in cells by analyzing whether stat <dig> is a substrate for sumo protease senp <dig>  for this, stat <dig>  sumo- <dig> and senp1-flag or catalytically inactive senp <dig> c603s-flag were transfected into cos- <dig> cells and equal amounts of protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-stat <dig> antibody and immunoblotted with anti-stat <dig> and anti-sumo- <dig> antibodies. as shown in figure 1a, co-transfection of senp <dig> wt completely abolished the slower migrating stat1-sumo- <dig> band indicating that sumoylation of stat <dig> is reversible and senp <dig> can act as a sumo-specific isopeptidase for stat <dig> 

the identification of stat <dig> as a substrate for senp <dig> prompted us to investigate whether senp1-mediated desumoylation affects the transcriptional activity of stat <dig>  for this purpose, we analysed the activity of stat1-responsive gas-luciferace reporter in hela cells transfected with different concentrations of senp <dig> wt or senp <dig> c603s mutant. as shown in figure 1b, overexpression of senp <dig> significantly increased the transcriptional activity of endogenous stat <dig>  in contrast, overexpression of catalytically inactive senp <dig> c603s resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in gas-luciferase activity, most probably by blocking the interaction of endogenous senp <dig> with stat <dig>  leading to increased level of sumo-modified stat <dig> in the cells. this effect is also seen in figure 1a, where stat <dig> sumoylation is significantly increased when senp <dig> c603s is co-transfected into the cos- <dig> cells. collectively, these results indicate that desumoylation of stat <dig> enhances its transcriptional activity. these results are in line with previously reported results that sumoylation deficient stat <dig> mutants display higher transcriptional activity at stat <dig> target gene promoters  <cit> .

molecular model of the sumo conjugated stat <dig> dimer
ifn-γ-induced activation of stat <dig> transcription factor requires phosphorylation of tyr <dig> leading to its rapid homodimerization followed by translocation to the nucleus and binding to the target gene promoters  <cit> . to obtain further insight on the mechanisms and consequences of sumo conjugation to stat <dig>  we modeled the sumo moiety and analysed its orientation in stat <dig> dimer using information from the published structure of tyr <dig> phosphorylated stat <dig> homodimer bound to dna  <cit> . the interaction between stat <dig> monomers is formed between sh <dig> domain and phosphorylated tyrosine  <dig> of an adjacent monomer, so that the phosphate group is recognized by the strictly conserved arg <dig> residue that rises up from the interior of the sh <dig> domain. analysis of the sumo conjugation site  demonstrated that the side chains of lys <dig> of both monomers formed a projection on the same orientation with dna, and formed a suitable site for covalent isopeptide bond between stat <dig> and sumo . monomeric stat <dig> molecules have a tendency to form dimers in solution due to the β-sheet structure between two c-tail segments of stat <dig>  the formation of the β-sheet structure is mediated by hydrogen bonding through the backbone atoms of glu <dig>  ile <dig> and val <dig>  the formed dimer structure is further stabilized by interactions in the hydrophobic core between sh <dig> domains  <cit> . substitution of lys <dig> with arg, a commonly used sumoylation abrogating mutation, or substitution of glu <dig> with gln, are not predicted to interfere phosphorylation of tyr <dig> or interrupt interactions involved in the dimerization interface, or directly affect dna-binding properties of stat <dig> .

the crystal structure of thymine dna glycosylase  conjugated to sumo- <dig> has revealed that tdg forms two dissimilar molecular interfaces with sumo- <dig>  the covalent contact to sumo- <dig> occurs at the lys <dig> residue, but another interface is a β-sheet structure formed by β-strands of tdg and sumo- <dig>  <cit> . the structure of stat <dig> dimer  has a linker region  that is invisible in the electron density maps  <cit> . the immediate vicinity of sumoylation site to residues in both ‘ends’ of the loop structure pointed us to investigate and remodel this loop. to get insight on this, we constructed a model of sumoylated stat <dig> dimer using previously published coordinates of conjugated sumo- <dig>  <cit> . the loop amino acids 684– <dig> was reconstructed using two programs sybyl with amber <dig> ff <dig> force field  and insightii, and the analysis resulted in two highly similar loop models. sumo- <dig> was positioned on conjugation distance, and the constructed loop structure was presented adjacent to β-sheet structure of sumo- <dig>  this model proposes that interface between sumo- <dig> and the loop structure of stat <dig> can direct the sumo- <dig> moiety towards dna, creating a steric hindrance that can affect dna-binding of sumoylated stat <dig> dimer.

sumoylation deficient stat <dig> shows increased dna-binding activity
the molecular model suggested that sumoylation may alter the dna-binding properties of stat <dig>  mutation of lys <dig>  or glu <dig>  within the sumoylation consensus sequence in stat <dig> abolish sumoylation of stat <dig> and leads to enhanced stat <dig> transcriptional activity  <cit> . thus, we wanted to investigate if the dna-binding activity of sumoylation deficient stat <dig> mutants differ from the dna-binding properties of the wt stat <dig>  amino acids essential to sumo conjugation reside in the close proximity of the stat <dig> activating tyr <dig> phosphorylation site and therefore the mutations in the sumoylation site may affect to the tyrosine phosphorylation or dephosphorylation properties of stat <dig>  e705q mutation in stat <dig> is predicted to have minimal structural consequences to stat <dig> but it abolishes stat <dig> sumoylation   <cit> . to analyse the phosphorylation of different sumoylation deficient stat <dig> mutants, u3a cells lacking endogenous stat <dig> were transfected either with stat <dig> wt or with sumoylation deficient k703r, e705a or e705q mutants. phosphorylation deficient stat <dig> y701f mutant was used as a negative control. after ifn-γ stimulation cells were lysed and equal amounts of protein were separated in sds-page and tyr <dig> phosphorylation was analyzed by using phospho-tyr701-stat <dig> specific antibody . the pstat <dig> antibody detected the tyr <dig> phosphorylation of stat <dig> e705q, while the stat <dig> e705a showed only a weak signal and the antibody failed to detect ifn-γ stimulated stat <dig> k703r . the difference is likely to be caused by the altered amino acid sequence within or in the proximity of the epitope for the pstat <dig> antibody since another pstat <dig> antibody  readily detected also k703r and e705a mutants after pervanadate stimulation . the sumo deficient stat <dig> mutant e705q was chosen for further dna-binding studies.

in order to study the dna-binding properties of stat <dig>  we performed oligoprecipitation experiments using two biotinylated oligos, one containing stat1-binding site from gbp- <dig> promoter and another with stat1-binding site from irf- <dig> gene promoter. u3a cells were transfected either with ha-tagged stat <dig> wt or stat <dig> e705q or stat <dig> y701f mutants together with his-tagged sumo- <dig>  cells were left unstimulated or treated with ifn-γ and osmotic shock to induce stat <dig> tyr <dig> phosphorylation and stat <dig> sumoylation, respectively  <cit> . stat <dig> wt and the stat <dig> mutants were oligoprecipitated from the whole cell lysates and the phosphorylation of stat <dig> was detected with anti-pstat <dig> antibody. sumoylation deficient stat <dig> e705q showed increased binding to both oligos when compared to stat <dig> wt . in the lysates the e705q mutant was slightly less tyrosine phosphorylated than stat <dig> wt , indicating that the increased dna-binding of stat <dig> e705q is not a consequence of its altered tyr <dig> phosphorylation. restaining the membranes from figure 3a with anti-ha antibody also showed that more stat <dig> e705q was bound to dna when compared to stat <dig> wt . the result was verified by quantitating the intensities of the oligoprecipitated stat <dig> bands that were normalized against total amount of input stat <dig>  or against the amount of tyr <dig> phosphorylated stat <dig>  . furthermore, overexpression of sumo- <dig> hindered stat <dig> wt binding to irf-1-oligo in u3a cells, providing further proof that sumoylation inhibits stat <dig> dna-binding . of note, additional oligoprecipitation experiments were carried out with larger protein amounts that would allow detection of sumoylated stat <dig>  in this experimental setting, sumoylation was not detected in the dna-bound fraction of stat <dig>  while sumo- <dig> conjugation was readily observed in equal amount of cellular stat <dig> . these results suggest that sumoylated stat <dig> does not bind to dna or that the dna-binding of sumoylated stat <dig> is significantly diminished.

promoter bound stat <dig> dimer is known to interact with histone acetyl transferase creb-binding protein  and acetylation of histones is essential for stat1-mediated transcriptional activation  <cit> . next, we wanted to investigate whether the enhanced dna-binding of sumoylation deficient stat <dig> has functional consequences at the promoter level. to this end, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation  assays on the stat <dig> target gene gbp- <dig>  u3a cells stably overexpressing stat <dig> wt or sumoylation deficient stat <dig> mutant were either left unstimulated or stimulated with human ifn-γ. immunoprecipitation of cross-linked and scattered chromatin was performed with anti-acetylated histone h <dig> antibody or anti-rabbit igg antibody as a control. stat <dig> k703r expressing cells showed increased acetylation of histone h <dig> when compared to stat <dig> wt . this result suggests that the enhanced promoter binding of sumoylation defective stat <dig> results in enhanced association of histone acetyl transferases to the promoter leading to increased histone h <dig> acetylation.

sumoylation does not prevent stat <dig> dimerization
dimerization mediated through the interactions between the tyr <dig> phosphorylated tail segment of one stat <dig> and the sh <dig> domain of an adjacent stat <dig> is considered to be essential for proper dna-binding and transcriptional activity of stat <dig>  <cit> . to investigate if sumoylation affects stat <dig> dimerization and inhibits downstream dna-binding in this manner, cells were co-transfected with ha- and flag-tagged stat <dig> together or without his-tagged sumo- <dig>  after  <dig> hours, the cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with ifn-γ and osmotic shock prior to cell lysis. equal amounts of whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-flag agarose beads and immunoblotting with anti-ha antibody was used to detect if ha-tagged stat <dig> molecules interact with flag-tagged stat <dig>  as shown in figure 4a, a slower migrating band  corresponding to the size of sumo- <dig> conjugated stat <dig> was detected with anti-ha antibody, suggesting that sumoylated ha-tagged stat <dig> interacts with stat1-flag. figure 4b shows as a control that anti-flag agarose does not pull down ha-tagged stat <dig>  these results suggest that sumoylation of stat <dig> does not prevent stat <dig> dimerization and are consistent with the results that conjugated sumo moiety affects the interaction between stat <dig> and dna through steric hindrance.

discussion
sumoylation is a common post-translational modification of transcription factors, but in several proteins the physiological functions and molecular mechanisms of this modification have remained enigmatic. several lines of evidence support the concept that sumo serves as a negative regulator of stat <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, the results demonstrating that sumoylation also negatively regulates stat5-mediated signaling and the only stat transcription factor in drosophila melanogaster, stat92e, indicates that sumoylation is an evolutionary conserved post-translational modification for some stat transcription factors  <cit> .

sumoylation is a highly reversible covalent modification that is regulated through conjugating and deconjugating enzymes. several studies support the importance of pias1-mediated sumoylation of the proteins. recently, it was shown that pias <dig> regulates oncogenic signaling by sumoylating promyelocytic tumor suppressor  that leads to its ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation  <cit> . pias <dig> has also been shown to associate with protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1b  and to catalyze its sumoylation, which resulted in down-regulation of the phosphatase activity and inhibited dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor. pias1-mediated negative regulation of ptp1b was reversed by senp <dig>  an isopeptidase that was also shown to regulate sumoylation of stat <dig>  <cit> . senp <dig> knock out mice were found to have severe defects in early t and b cell development. the defect in lymphoid development was likely caused by enhanced level of stat <dig> sumoylation that subsequently led to decreased stat <dig> transcriptional activity  <cit> . in our experiments removal of conjugated sumo- <dig> by senp <dig> increased stat1-mediated reporter gene expression, thus confirming the negative regulatory role of sumoylation for stat <dig> .

stat <dig> homodimerization is required for the optimal ifn-γ-mediated gene activation and stat <dig> homodimers form a nutcracker-like structure that binds to dna. the monomers are held together by interface between tyr <dig> phosphorylated c-terminal tail segment of one monomer and the sh <dig> domain of the other  <cit> . the lys <dig> is located adjacent to the dimerization interface and this prompted us to investigate if sumoylation of the lys <dig> could affect dimerization or dna-binding of stat <dig>  analysis of the sumo conjugation consensus site in stat <dig> dimer revealed that side chain of lys <dig> formed a projection towards dna. both lys <dig> and glu <dig> residues have hydrophilic side chains, which are converted away from the hydrophobic core of sh <dig> interface. additionally, the β-sheet structure between two c-tail segments of stat <dig> dimer is not likely to be affected by lys <dig> mutation to arg, while this mutation will interrupt the formation of covalent bond with sumo. the structural analysis revealed that side chain of lys <dig> has an interaction phase with glu <dig> residue in the sh <dig> domain of the adjacent monomer. most probably this interface prevents rotation of this flexible side chain and keeps orientation favorable for the sumo conjugation. the finding of controlled position of lys <dig> also supports the importance of lys <dig> as an sumo acceptor site . sumoylation has been shown to impede tyr <dig> phosphorylation of stat <dig> and subsequent sh <dig> domain-phospho-tyr701-mediated homodimerization, leading to formation of semi-phosphorylated dimers that interact through their n-terminal domains  <cit> . our experimental data indicated that sumoylated stat <dig> can form dimers, but it remains to be determined if the interaction is mediated through their n-terminal domains or through the sh <dig> domains .

to predict how sumo- <dig> would structurally orientate in sh <dig> domain-phospho-tyr <dig> interaction-mediated stat <dig> dimers, we reconstructed the structure of the disordered loop 684– <dig> of stat <dig>  and made a molecular model of sumoylated stat <dig> dimer using x-ray structure of tdg-sumo- <dig> as a template  <cit> . this model suggests that the position of sumo under the loop structure is directed towards dna and can inhibit interaction with nucleic acids . furthermore, results from the oligonucleotide pull down experiments indicated that sumoylation interferes stat <dig> binding to stat1-responsive promoters, as sumoylation deficient stat <dig> e705q showed increased dna-binding to both gbp-1- and irf-1-oligos , and as sumo- <dig> overexpression hindered stat <dig> binding to irf-1-oligo . the difference in the dna-binding properties between stat <dig> wt and e705q mutant was not caused by altered tyr <dig> phosphorylation   <cit> . in addition, another sumoylation deficient stat <dig> mutant k703r also showed increased binding to gbp- <dig> oligo . taken together, the oligoprecipation experiments are supporting the molecular model where sumo moiety interferes with dna-binding of stat <dig> .

sumoylated stat <dig> was not detected in our oligoprecipitation experiments  and this result is consistent with results by song et al. , showing that sumoylated stat <dig> does not bind to dna, or that the bound fraction is very small  <cit> . in their emsa studies song et al. also found that sumoylation deficient stat <dig> k703r mutant shows prolonged binding to gas-probe, but unexpectedly sumoylation deficient e705a mutant had similar dna-binding profile than stat <dig> wt  <cit> . we chose to use stat <dig> e705q mutant in the dna-binding experiments because the mutant has been reported to have minimal sumo-independent effects on stat <dig> when compared to k703r and e705a mutations  <cit> . our results with stat <dig> e705q suggest that sumoylation inhibits dna-binding properties of stat <dig>  supporting this and previously published results of song et al. , we observed that stat <dig> k703r has enhanced binding to gbp-1-oligo when compared to stat <dig> wt as well . furthermore, sumoylation deficient stat <dig> showed enhanced histone h <dig> acetylation on gbp- <dig> promoter , thus functionally confirming the enhanced stat <dig> promoter binding. whether sumoylation also alters the interaction with histone acetyl transferases, such as cbp, remains to be determined.

it has become evident that sumoylation participates in regulation of stats and the precise molecular mechanisms and physiological functions are gradually being revealed. several studies have analysed sumoylation in stat <dig>  and sumoylation has been shown to inhibit stat <dig> activity by different mechanisms. sumo conjugation to lys <dig> inhibits phosphorylation of tyr <dig>  <cit>  and prevents paracrystal formation, thereby increasing solubility of stat <dig> which subjects stat <dig> for dephosphorylation  <cit> . our results suggest an additional regulatory mechanism for sumoylation and indicate that sumo moiety is directed towards dna and can inhibit dna-binding of stat <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
sumo conjugation to stat <dig> has been shown to negatively regulate stat1-mediated gene responses  <cit> . this study was aimed to investigate further the mechanism by which sumoylation regulates stat <dig>  the inhibitory role of sumo- <dig> on stat <dig> was confirmed by showing that overexpression of desumoylating enzyme senp <dig> increases stat1-mediated transcriptional activity. a molecular model of sumoylated stat <dig> dimer suggested that sumo- <dig> is directed towards dna creating steric hindrance that is able to affect dna-binding properties of stat <dig>  oligoprecipitation experiments were consistent with this model and showed that sumoylation deficient stat <dig> mutant has enhanced binding to two independent stat <dig> target gene promoters. the difference in dna-binding was not attributed to the level of tyr <dig> phosphorylation of stat <dig>  consequently, sumoylation defective stat <dig> mutant displayed increased histone h <dig> acetylation of gbp- <dig> promoter. taken together, these findings suggest that sumoylation functions as a negative regulator of stat <dig> responses by modulating the dna-binding properties of stat <dig>

analysis of the tyr <dig> phosphorylation of the sumoylation deficient stat <dig> mutants and the effect of sumoylation on stat <dig> dna-binding.  tyr <dig> phosphorylation of wt stat <dig> and stat <dig> mutants in response to ifn-γ. u3a cells were transfected with stat <dig> wt, k703r, e705a, e705q or y701f together with sumo-1-his as indicated. cells were either left unstimulated or stimulated with ifn-γ prior to lysis. equal amounts of protein lysates were separated in sds-page and immunoblotted with anti-pstat <dig> and anti-ha antibodies.  comparison of band intensities of the gbp-1-oligoprecipitated wt stat <dig> and stat <dig> e705q stained with anti-pstat <dig>  and anti-ha  antibodies.  comparison of wt stat <dig> and stat <dig> e705q band intensities from to irf-1-oligoprecipitates stained with anti-pstat <dig>  and anti-ha  antibodies. band intensities were studied with imagej software and analysed after background subtraction. the intensity of wt stat <dig> was set as one in every bar graph . the error bars indicate sd from two independent experiments.  overexpression of sumo- <dig> inhibits stat <dig> dna-binding. u3a cells were transfected with stat1-ha together with empty vector or sumo-1-his. cells were stimulated with ifn-γ and osmotic shock as indicated. after cell lysis equal amounts of protein from the whole cell lysates were oligoprecipitated with irf-1-oligo and separated in sds-page followed by immunoblotting with anti-pstat <dig> antibody . for detection of the total amount of tyr <dig> phosphorylated stat <dig> and the stat <dig> expression levels in the lysates, equal amounts of protein lysates were immunoblotted with anti-pstat <dig> and anti-ha antibodies, respectively .  sumoylated stat <dig> does not bind dna. cos- <dig> cells were transfected with wt stat1-ha together with sumo-1-his. prior to lysis cells were stimulated with ifn-γ and osmotic shock as indicated. gbp-1-oligoprecipitated proteins were separated in the sds-page together with protein samples from the whole cell lysates . stat <dig> and stat1-sumo- <dig> bands were detected by immunoblotting with anti-ha antibody. both panels are from the same gel, but additional lanes have been cut off from the middle. ib: immunoblot, op: oligoprecipitation, u.s.: unspecific band.
