BACKGROUND
diversification of prokaryotes attracts much attention from ecologists because it plays a critical role in ecosystem equilibrium and dynamics. speciation of bacteria is distinct from eukaryotes, especially given the predominantly asexual reproduction  <cit>  and the rare occurrence of geographic barriers. bacterial speciation is often triggered by adaptive divergence  <cit> , while homologous recombination, which leads to gene flow cohering diverging populations, simultaneously occurs, a model approximating parapatric or sympatric speciation  <cit> . accordingly, diversifying selection plays a key role in differentiating sister species. on the other hand, favorable genes could be brought by homologous recombination enable the recipient to explore a new niche  <cit> , an example of adaptive processes in bacterial diversification under gene flow  <cit> .

many of the bacteria in the genus xanthomonas, of the γ-subdivision of proteobacteria, cause plant diseases, e.g., bacterial spots and blights in leaves and fruits  <cit> . these plant pathogens often display a high degree of host specificity  <cit> , e.g., x. citri pv. citri exclusively infecting citrus, with various genetic mechanisms associated with the host specificity  <cit> . host shifts occurred in pv. mangiferaeindicae that causes bacterial black spot in mango, and in pv. vesicatoria that attacks pepper and tomato, displaying a wide phylogenetic range of hosts in x. citri  <cit> . in contrast, x. campestris pathovars predominantly infect crucifers  <cit> . it has been known that favorable traits enable deviating populations to explore novel niches in an ecosystem  <cit> . during habitat shifts such as host transformation, evolutionary footprints of adaptation were often reserved in the genomes  <cit> . lu et al. found that six pathogenicity-related gene clusters were associated with the genomic divergences in xanthomonas  <cit> . in this study, via a comparative genomic analysis, we comprehensively investigated genomic divergence and adaptation in xanthomonas, and the contributions of host shifts and homologous recombination to the adaptive diversification between species.

to date, whole genomes of  <dig> xanthomonas taxa, including x. campestris pv. campestris   <cit> , x. campestris pv. raphani  <cit> , x. citri pv. vesicatoria  <cit> , x. citri pv. citrumelo  <cit> , x. citri pv. citri, x. albilineans  <cit> , x. oryzae pv. oryzae   <cit> , and x. oryzicola  <cit> , have been sequenced with conventional shotgun sequencing. the size of their genomes varies from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb, with a high gc content of  <dig> – <dig> % in the chromosome  <cit> . phylogenomic analysis revealed a close affinity among x. citri pv. mangiferaeindicae, x. citri pv. citri, and x. citri pv. citrumelo, three taxa that are closely related to x. citri. pv. vesicatoria  <cit> . recently, a  <dig> -mb genome of x. citri pv. mangiferaeindicae strain lmg  <dig> from india with  <dig> contigs was obtained by pyrosequencing  <cit> . in order to comprehend the genetic divergence among recently diverging strains, we sequenced the genome of bcrc  <dig>  a local mangiferaeindicae strain from taiwan. as the two strains lmg  <dig> and bcrc  <dig> of x. citri pv. mangiferaeindicae diverged only recently, how they became genetically differentiated is quite fascinating. in this study, for exploring the nature of adaptive diversification in xanthomonas, comparative genomic analyses were conducted on two nonsister species complexes of xanthomonas, i.e., x. citri and x. campestris. the patterns of genomic divergence, homologous recombination, and genes under positive selection were examined to elucidate the ecological interactions among xanthomonas taxa.

RESULTS
general features of the xanthomonas citri pv. mangiferaeindicae genome
the genome of x. citri pv. mangiferaeindicae bcrc  <dig>  was sequenced, and  <dig> , <dig>  bases of paired-end data  and  <dig> , <dig>  bases of mate-paired data  were retrieved. these sequences were de novo assembled to  <dig> contigs, and scaffolded into  <dig> scaffolds, which comprised  <dig> ,324 bp with a gc content of  <dig> % and indicated the sequence coverage is  <dig> . the largest scaffold was  <dig> ,619 bp long, and the n <dig> statistic was  <dig>  bp, with an average length of  <dig>  bp . the protein-coding gene prediction, confirmed by blast searches against the ncbi database, identified  <dig>  coding sequences,  <dig>  of which could be categorized into clusters of orthologous groups  . when compared with the draft genome of xcm strain lmg  <dig>  , these two strains shared similar gc contents and  <dig> rrna genes in  <dig> sets of rrna operon , whereas the average length , n <dig> statistic , number of protein-coding sequences , and number of trna genes  were all greater in xcm-b, suggesting higher genome completeness in the genome that we sequenced and assembled. in addition, we aligned  <dig> scaffolds of xcm-b against those of xcm-l. among the  <dig> contigs of xcm-l,  <dig> could be mapped onto the  <dig> scaffolds of xcm-b, whereas none of the xcm-l contigs were mapped onto xcm-b with more than one scaffold . nevertheless, aligning both sequences helped verify the conserved genomes between the two strains. the genomes of two xcm strains shared  <dig>  protein-coding genes, with only  <dig> variables, reaching an average protein sequence identity of  <dig> %.table  <dig>

phylogenetic relationships and homologous recombination among xanthomonas species
as xcm-b that infects mango was once classified as a member of x. campestris  <cit> , we tested the robustness of the classification of  <dig> x. citri taxa  and  <dig> x. campestris taxa  . based on a concatenated alignment of  <dig> orthologous core genes shared by the  <dig> taxa, the best maximum likelihood  tree identified two major clades corresponding to species. in the citri-clade,  <dig> xcm strains were clustered with xcc, while xccm was sister to xcv; within the campestris-clade, xcca and xcc <dig> were closely related, both being affined to xccb and xcr .figure  <dig>

recombination can cohere the taxa within a species, but dissociates sister taxa when it occurs between long-split species. here, we combined the alignment-based programs geneconv and phipack to detect genes affected by recombination between or within species. in total,  <dig> core genes  were detected with genetic recombination, which included  <dig> genes with cross-overs occurring between x. citri and x. campestris,  <dig> genes only detected within species, while  <dig> have likely derived from other distant species . single gene trees were generated with the neighbor-joining method. for  <dig> of the  <dig> trees , the topologies agreed with the division between citri and campestris, suggesting a long split between the  <dig> species.

genome-wide variations and recombination events
genetic divergences were not homogeneously distributed along the chromosome. some genomic regions displayed higher divergences than the others, as so-called “genomic islands of divergence”  <cit> . here, we used synonymous substitution rates , a near-neutral indicator of genetic divergence, to assess the divergence along the genome. in the comparison between  <dig> xcm strains based on the orthologous genes between xcm and xcc, only one major peak was observed in the putative prophage region, while the remaining regions displayed more or less uniform levels of genomic variation . we further investigated the genic structure of the prophage region. of the genes shared between the two strains of xcm,  <dig> remained intact, while  <dig> genes had become eliminated . in the comparison between xcm-b and xcc,  <dig> genes were lost in xcm-b . all these results supported rapid evolution with dramatic gain or loss of genes in the prophage region. furthermore, to examine the associations between host shifting and genomic divergence, pairwise comparisons were conducted in pairs of xcm vs. xcc  and xccm vs. xcv  using  <dig> core orthologous genes. two major ks peaks of  <dig> – <dig>  m bp and  <dig> – <dig>  m bp were shared by the host-shifting pairs, while only a few recombination events were detected in these regions . it is evident that numerous divergence peaks overlap with peaks of the density of recombination events, implying a correlation between homologous recombination and genetic divergence . as shown by spearman’s rank correlation test, both comparisons were significant in the correlation between ks values and the number of genes with recombination . in addition, comparisons between closely related strains, i.e., xcm-b vs. xcm-l and xcca vs. xcc <dig>  were also performed. similar to the comparisons of host-shifting pairs, significant positive correlations were also observed in the strain pairs without host-shifting . at the gene level, the genes with recombination showed higher ks than those without recombination based on pairwise comparisons  , implying that these genes may facilitate the diversification among xanthomonas strains. taken together, these results suggest that homologous recombination largely affect the pattern of genomic divergence between xanthomonas species.figure  <dig>

genes under positive selection
for identifying positively selected genes within each xanthomonas lineage, codeml analyses were conducted with the branch-site model on all branches. in total,  <dig> genes  were detected under positive selection. of these positively selected genes, only  <dig> were shared between x. citri and x. campestris, while  <dig> were exclusively in x. citri, and  <dig> were only in x. campestris , implying different diversification scenarios.. among the tree branches of the citri-group, along the branches of xcv and xcm, with host shifts,  <dig> and  <dig> positively selected genes were detected, respectively . as for the remaining branches without host-shift events, the numbers of positively selected genes are as follows:  <dig> in xcm-l,  <dig> in xcm-b,  <dig> in xccm, and  <dig> in xcc. likewise, in the campestris group,  <dig> positively selected genes occurred in the xcca lineage, followed by  <dig> in xcc <dig>   <dig> in xccb, and  <dig> in xcr. interestingly, the lineages in citri-group coupled with the host-shift events possessed more genes under positive selection . we further tested the association between homologous recombination and positive selection. in total,  <dig>  out of  <dig> positively selected genes were identified with recombination, with  <dig> in the citri-group, and  <dig> in the campestris-group, all significantly deviating from a random distribution  . intriguingly, the majority of the genes under positive selection did not display tree topologies deviating from the species tree, as shown by  <dig> %  in the citri-group and  <dig> %  in the campestris-group agreeing with the species tree  .figure  <dig>

discussion
speciation processes in xanthomonas
bacterial diversity, which often results from species diversification through ecological interactions, greatly influences the ecosystem health. xanthomonas species, which can cause serious diseases and economic loss of crops, are an excellent group for examining speciation models. the genomes of  <dig> taxa that belong to x. citri and x. campestris have been completely sequenced, providing a large data set as a sound foundation for investigating the extent of genetic divergence between species. their host specificity makes the group even more useful as a system for examining adaptation over the host shifts because the host range of the group as a whole is quite broad. in this study, two strains of x. citri pv. mangiferaeindicae from taiwan  and india  and two strains of x. campestris  displayed slight genetic differentiation, providing a window for investigating incipient genetic divergence. as expected, given a shorter time for isolation, strains had lower levels of genetic divergence than that of species/pathovars. it is noticeable that prophage-introduced dna fragments were detected in x. citri pv. mangiferaeindicae and pv. citri  <cit> , an event that exclusively occurred in x. citri. several salient features were observed in these inserted dna fragments. first, long dna fragments of  <dig>  bp were lost in genomes of the two pathovars . second, a high proportion of genes  became eliminated along with the divergence time. third, higher nucleotide substitution rates were detected in these inserted dnas than in the host bacterial genome. these facts indicate that the foreign genes introduced by the phage tended to lose functions and were likely to be removed from the genome eventually , although gene residues may still remain  <cit> .

on the other hand, homologous recombination had started to contribute noticeably to the global diverging patterns among xanthomonas strains at the incipient stage, as shown by the positive and significant correlation with genomic divergence . homologous recombination is well documented in prokaryotes with foreign genes introgressed into the recipient species  <cit> . recombination often occurs between closely related bacteria, resulting in convergence of two bacterial populations; recombination with divergent bacteria brings variations into the recipient population, facilitating the differentiation among incipient species  <cit> .

furthermore,  <dig> and  <dig> genes under positive selection were detected in the lineages leading to xcm-l and xcm-b, respectively. also, of the  <dig> genes involved in diversifying selection of pv. mangiferaeindicae,  <dig> genes were involved in homologous recombination. similarly,  <dig> of  <dig> genes under positive selection were detected with recombination for xcca and xcc <dig>  at early stages of speciation or diversification, the interplay between natural selection and homologous recombination clearly played a key role in differentiating incipient species/races.

homologous recombination in xanthomonas
in this study, we found frequent genetic recombination in xanthomonas, with about 10% of the core genome mediated with homologous recombination, whereas only 2% of the core genes displayed phylogenies deviating from the species tree. this gap to the expectations simply came from intraspecific crossovers, which constitute the most recombination events  with short dna fragments. apparently, those genes displaying trees inconsistent with the species tree represented footprints of gene flow between species. this result suggests that the divergence of xanthomonas tends to follow parapatric speciation, in which gene flow between species can be long lasting and nonstop  <cit> . this is a pattern well documented in the archaea and bacteria  <cit> . it is intriguing that most of the foreign genes were favored by natural selection , especially those associated with plant infection , reflecting a fact that homologous recombination may create advantageous new alleles for a so-called “hopeful monster”  <cit>  in bacteria. altogether, the topology of the putative species tree in xanthomonas reflects a scenario of deep divergence between species, mediated by recurrent gene flow at the same time  <cit> .

in this study,  <dig> out of  <dig> genes with recombination were under positive selection . via homologous recombination, genes were able to be interchanged between strains, and advantageous alleles that helped bacterial colonization would be favored by natural selection  <cit> . of these genes, it is noticeable that rpfb  and rpfc  of the rpf gene cluster, which regulates the virulence of xanthomonas  <cit> , were positively selected in x. citri pv. citri lineage . functionally, rpfb encodes a fatty acyl-coa ligase, which catalyzes the synthesis of an important signal molecule that regulates the expression of virulence genes  <cit> . rpfb signaling is perceived by the two component system of rpfc and rpfg  <cit> , and the mutations of rpfc were found to reduce the pathogenicity of x. citri pv. citri  <cit> . accordingly, existence of favorable rpfb alleles suggests that homologous recombination may have helped the adaptation of xanthomonas. besides, dsbd  has been reported to be associated with copper tolerance  <cit> . copper compounds are frequently used as bactericides in controlling the leaf infection of xanthomonas species, including x. citri  <cit> . a previous experiment showed that a dsbd knockout mutant was highly sensitive to environmental copper  <cit> . an effective dsbd allele was capable of reducing the impacts of the copper-containing bactericides, thus enabling the bacterium to escape from the agricultural control.

host shifts likely triggering genetic adaptation
like the findings of previous studies, compared with the vast portions of the genome that are usually shaped by purifying selection, adaptive genes only constitute a relatively smaller proportion of the chromosome instead  <cit> . furthermore, in this study, genes under positive selection  were unequally distributed along lineages, with significantly more genes located at lineages leading to nodes coupled with host shifts . for example, at the lineages from x. citri pv. citri leading to x. citri pv. mangiferaeindicae and x. citri pv. vescatoria with hosts shifts among citrus, mango and pepper, respectively,  <dig> and  <dig> positively selected genes were detected, revealing faster accumulation of positively selected genes than other lineages without host shifts. however, the lineages of x. campestris pv. raphani and pv. campestris, both infecting the brassicaceae without host shifting, did not show facilitated positive selection. this contrasting pattern suggested that favorable genes may have helped the bacteria in exploring new niches. the tight association between positively selected genes and host shifts further suggests that xanthomonas likely followed ecological speciation, which describes species arising from ecological diversification  <cit> .

we found that some positively selected genes were associated with the host shifting events. it is notable that the potg gene , that encodes atpase involved in putrescine transport, was shaped by positive selection in the x. citri pv. vesicatoria lineage. putrescine is a ubiquitous polyamine that enhances the interaction between plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi   <cit> , which in turn have been shown to activate plant defense against infectious pathogens such as xanthomonas  <cit> . alternatively, the removal of exogenous putrescine from the soil may impede host colonization by amf; thus, an effective potg gene that decreases amf colonization of host plant will be favored by natural selection, subsequently helping x. citri pv. vesicatoria to explore a new niche . in addition, btub gene  was positively selected in x. citri pv. mangiferaeindicae lineage. btub is responsible for the iron uptake, while iron dependent superoxide dismutases are vital in inhibiting the reactive oxygen species  responses in host cells, thus increasing the infection rates  <cit> . interestingly, previous studies revealed that the iron contents in mango leaves might be hundreds times lower than that in citrus leaves   <cit> . the sharp difference suggested that an effective iron transporter was needed when the host shifted from citrus to mango.

in addition to the genes related to the host shifting, an hrp regulon gene xcm <dig> that encodes components for the type iii secretion system   <cit>  was detected as loci under positive selection in the x. citri. the pathogenicity of xanthomonas mainly depends on the t3ss, which is highly conserved among plant and animal pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . curiously, the amino acid sequences of the major subunit of hrp pili are hypervariable in different subspecies of bacterial pathogens  <cit> . the rapidly evolving hrp pili provide evidence for strong positive selection in xanthomonas spp. and diversifying selection in pseudomonas syringae  <cit> . the acquisition of the hrp gene cluster has been found to be associated with the adaptation and plant pathogenicity in xanthomonas  <cit> . thus, we hypothesized that the positive selection on hrpf gene may be responsible for the invasion routes and the host specificity of xanthomonas. furthermore, two genes involved in type iv secretion system were detected with positive selections exclusively in x. campestris, seemingly agreeing that type iv secretion system may not be involved in the infection of x. citri on citrus  <cit> . moreover, ecpd  that encodes an adhesion protein to help pili assembly was positively selected in xcm-l. ecpd has been shown to facilitate the polymerization of ecpa to form pilus in escherichia coli and involve in host cell recognition or biofilm formation  <cit> . xanthomonas species only possessed ecpd while lacks other members of ecp operon. we therefore hypothesized that ecpd might participate the assembly of the other pili in association with the virulence in xanthomonas. on the other hand, a xylanase gene xyna  was positively selected at the branch leading to x. campestris pv. campestris . xylan is a major component in the cell walls of land plants and exists in all plant tissues  <cit> . previous studies showed xylanases are responsible for the virulence of x. citri pv. vesicatoria and x. oryzae pv. oryzae  <cit> . two gene clusters xcs and xps of the type ii secretion system  have been shown to control the secretion of xylanases in xcv and are associated with the virulence  <cit> . nevertheless, no member of these two gene clusters was detected under positive selection in this study .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we sequenced a genome of x. citri pv. mangiferaeindicae and conducted genomic analyses of  <dig> taxa of x. citri and campestris. between the  <dig> strains of xcm, only the prophage region displayed sharp differentiation, while gradually losing the constituting genes. in addition, we found homologous recombination frequently occurring in the xanthomonas genomes, which likely represented footprints of gene flow between species, thus most likely suggesting parapatric speciation. it is noticeable that facilitated accumulations of positively selected genes occurred along the lineages with host shifts. interestingly, most of the favored genes were acquired from homologous recombination. taken together, the genes with recombination enabled xanthomonas species to explore novel niches and respond to environmental stresses, subsequently resulting in adaptive diversification in this pathogenic genus.
