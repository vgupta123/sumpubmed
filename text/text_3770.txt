BACKGROUND
sturgeons , the producers of caviar, are remnant survivors of the once flourishing chondrosteans, dominant fishes of the permian period. the continued persistence of these 'living fossils' is threatened throughout north america, europe, and asia. today there are two species of atlantic sea sturgeons; the european sturgeon acipenser sturio, found in france , and the atlantic sturgeon a. oxyrinchus inhabiting the rivers and coastal waters from the gulf of mexico to the canadian maritime provinces. although classified as sister species and showing some phenotypic similarities, approximately  <dig> million years of isolation  <cit>  has resulted in physiological differences between these two species. for example, european sturgeons prefer spawning temperatures ≥ 20°c, while atlantic sturgeons exhibit latitudinal variation in spawning temperatures ranging from as low as 13°c in canada to 26°c in the southeastern u.s.  <cit> .

according to archaeological and molecular dating, a population of atlantic sturgeon was founded in the baltic sea during the middle ages  by migrants from north america  <cit> . these founders created a self-sustaining population, which became disjunct from the western atlantic populations. this baltic population has been over-exploited by commercial fisheries and was extirpated in the 20th century. a group of international fishery managers are now seeking to re-establish the extirpated population using fish from the original source population, on the grounds that north american a. oxyrinchus exhibit sufficient ecological and genetic potential for a successful restoration. to increase the probability of success of such a restoration in the long-term, the ideal scenario would be to identify and use a founder group that is genetically closely related to the extinct population. although the utility of ancient dna studies to elucidate evolutionary relationships and guide restoration projects has been recognized  <cit> , the full extent of management applications from these studies have not yet been realized.

in this study, we investigated the evolutionary and demographic characteristics of the historic founders, by performing an extensive genetic characterization of the extinct baltic population derived from medieval tissue samples representing their first generations starting at the 8th century. we focused on identifying the region-of-origin of the north american founders, and on calculating the effective number of individuals that originally founded the baltic population ~ <dig>  years ago.

RESULTS
mitochondrial dna 
two hundred and twenty seven dna samples from  <dig> ancient bony scutes  were successfully screened for their mtdna control region haplotypes. the species a. sturio and a. oxyrinchus were differentiated by  <dig> diagnostic substitutions  . two hundred and twenty scutes had a. oxyrinchus control region haplotypes . seven scutes shared haplotype as <dig> from a. sturio.

morphological classification
the morphology of  <dig> bony scutes was preserved sufficiently to identify species. of this number,  <dig> were classified as a. oxyrinchus; whereas  <dig> showed typical a. sturio surfaces. morphological classifications were subject to error depending on the state of scute preservation. however,  <dig>  samples were classified as the same species based on morphology and mitochondrial dna. four scutes yielding a. sturio haplotypes showed a. oxyrinchus morphology; in contrast  <dig> scutes had a. oxyrinchus mtdna and a. sturio morphology.

amplification of nuclear dna
allelic profiles of  <dig>  randomly selected scutes from ralswieck, island of rugia germany were successfully amplified. the  <dig> randomly selected scutes yielded unique multilocus genotypes. locus afu- <dig> was monomorphic in two populations . profiles of seven polymorphic microsatellite loci were used for the assignment analysis: afu- <dig> , afu- <dig> , afu- <dig> , afu- <dig> , aox- <dig> , aox- <dig>  and aox- <dig> . all loci used in this study showed allelic patterns of disomic inheritance. the detected structure  of a. oxyrinchus populations was related to their geographic distribution. baltic and canadian sturgeons grouped together . structure results showed a high allele-frequency similarity of baltic samples with canadian samples . a single sample was assigned to the mid-atlantic population. probability values for region-of-origin assignment are given in table  <dig>  fst estimates   and amova values  were calculated using arlequin v.  <dig>   <cit>  based on haplotype frequencies of mtdna control region sequences.

identification of hybrids
flanking sequences of locus aox- <dig> were successfully amplified for  <dig>  scutes as previously described  <cit> . three hybrids  and four introgressed specimens  were identified. additional assignment tests calculated in structure including  <dig> artificial hybrids generated between fishes from source populations  and european sturgeons  designed in hybridlab  <dig>  clustered baltic sturgeon together with atlantic sturgeon, and produced no evidence for a historic hybrid population .

inference of the founder population size
using ancient and contemporary dna data for eight genetic loci , the size of the founding population to the baltic sea was inferred using the approximate bayesian computation  method. when the posterior densities obtained for the  <dig> genetic loci are combined, the effective founding population size is likely to be less than  <dig> . to evaluate the sensitivity of the results to the assumptions and methods used, different population histories, parameter values and estimation methods were tested. these included a more limited source population , the larger/smaller sizes of the modern north american/baltic populations, different time points for colonization, and different rejecting/weighing procedures. although the 95% hpd  intervals varied, the estimated total population sizes were less than  <dig> individuals in most cases. a strong bottleneck signal was exhibited by both mtdna data and also a few microsatellite loci. the assumption about the source population had a strong impact on the results. the 95% hpd interval became bigger when the canadian population was assumed to be the only source, because the resolving power of the statistical analysis declined due to their low genetic diversity.

estimated size of the founding population  to the baltic sea at the early middle ages. the abc method was applied to  <dig> , <dig> simulated genetic data sets . the following population history was assumed as a baseline 1: a small part of the source  populations colonized the baltic sea at  <dig> years or  <dig> generations before present , experienced single-generation bottleneck , then the populations of both sides of the atlantic  kept a constant size  until the baltic population became extinct. modified population assumptions were tested in the scenarios 2–6; 95% hpd  intervals are listed.

discussion
restoration projects are often faced with the problem that little information is available when choosing a founder group for restorative breeding, especially when native populations became extinct many decades ago. one powerful way of obtaining more information is to analyze the genetic structure of historic populations and their relationships to extant populations  <cit> . recent progress in ancient dna analysis enables investigations of historic population structures  <cit> . this information can be used to select specimens for introduction from appropriate regional groups, taking under consideration that individuals from different environments may exhibit evolutionarily important differences in adaptively significant traits.

congruent patterns of population structuring among collections of extant a. oxyrinchus have been identified in both mitochondrial  <cit>  and microsatellite dna  <cit>  which consisted of four regional clusters in the western atlantic: 1) gulf , 2) southeastern , 3) mid-atlantic , and 4) canadian  . in the present analysis of the microsatellite profiles of the ancient baltic population,  <dig> out of  <dig>  individuals were assigned to the canadian regional grouping and one fish was assigned to the mid-atlantic grouping  as identified in previous studies. an overwhelming predominance of canadian a. oxyrinchus genotypes within the ancient baltic population was similarly observed in the mtdna sequence data set ;  <dig> of  <dig>  bony scutes shared haplotype a while the two remaining specimens had haplotypes bs <dig> and bs <dig>  which are likely recent derivatives from haplotype a . however, it is difficult to decide when and where these "new" haplotypes evolved; prior to colonization in north america, or after the founding event in the baltic. if there were  <dig> or more female founders, it is possible that bs <dig> and bs <dig> may have evolved in north america. prior this study,  <dig> north american haplotypes from this control region fragment have been described. many of them were observed in only a few fish, sometimes single specimens . considering the fact that most north american populations are representing less than 10% of their population sizes  <dig> years ago  <cit> , haplotypes bs <dig> and bs <dig> could have become regionally extinct in north america. by contrast, if there was only one female founder, the two haplotypes must have evolved in the baltic sea.

these results demonstrate that the most northerly distributed a. oxyrinchus successfully colonized the baltic sea, suggesting that canadian specimens may have characteristics suitable for the environmental and ecological conditions that existed during the original founding. the iucn reintroduction guidelines state that the organisms used for reintroduction should be as closely related as possible genetically to those originally inhabiting the habitat  <cit> . we suggest therefore that canadian specimens should dominate the broodstock for reintroduction.

as recent physiological and biogeographic studies implicate temperature as a primary selection force for species survival and persistence of populations  <cit> , a second factor for consideration might be including specimens from populations with broader thermal tolerances in order to minimize risk to the restored population through climate change. the inclusion of specimens from the mid-atlantic population could potentially extend the thermal amplitude in associated physiological responses.

in any case, from an ecological point of view, there are potentially many factors which might contradict each restoration plan  <cit>  .

we observed a small number of hybrids and introgressed specimens indicating a historic baltic population of a. sturio; a conclusion that is supported by the archaeological record  <cit> . recently, the baltic population was suggested to be a hybrid population between european sturgeons and atlantic sturgeons  <cit> . however, this conclusion is not supported by the outcome of this study. taking genotype distribution observed for the 8th–13th centuries  and 18th–19th centuries  <cit>  under consideration, most likely both species were sympatric during the founding event. later, a. sturio was likely displaced by atlantic sturgeons due to the cooling during the little ice age. a. sturio may have evolved characteristics suitable for a warmer environment  rendering the species physically unable to persist permanently in the baltic region. baltic region was the most eastern historic distribution area of a. sturio. this region is characterized by a cold, continentally influenced climate. however, immigrations  of a. sturio from the north sea  into baltic rivers can not be excluded during warmer decades until the north sea population became extinct during the last century.

assuming canadian and mid-atlantic populations of a. oxyrinchus as the original founders, our simulations suggested that the baltic sea was colonized by fewer than  <dig> founders . the estimated number of founders changed as components of the simulation model were varied, but the estimated mean was  <dig> individuals at the largest. this finding was based on a discrete-generation model and relatively simple population dynamics. it must be noted that the assumption of constant population size is not likely to be valid, as intensive harvest caused drastic changes to population sizes. however, testing of several different scenarios indicated that this result was quite robust. there may have been several colonization events, but the outcome of this study indicates that only one of them is likely to have succeeded. from a genetic point of view, our study suggests that it may be possible for a small number of founders to result in a sustainable population.

CONCLUSIONS
ancient dna population genetic studies are a valuable tool for obtaining more information on historic population structure and information to select specimens for introduction from appropriate regional groups. furthermore, our results indicate that only a small number of individuals may have been sufficient for the establishment and persistence of a self-sustaining population. this agrees with recent studies which suggest that successful colonization from a small number of individuals probably occurs more often than previously thought  <cit> . our findings suggest that given a suitable environment, a long-term viable population may result from even a small founding population with limited genetic diversity, thus encouraging ongoing efforts to preserve and restore populations.
