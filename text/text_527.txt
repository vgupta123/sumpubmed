BACKGROUND
allergic rhinitis  affects 10% to 30% of the world's population and an estimated  <dig> to  <dig> million people in the united states alone  <cit> . intranasal corticosteroids are recommended first-line medications in patients with moderate or severe ar and provide effective relief of nasal symptoms and congestion because of their potent anti-inflammatory activity  <cit> .

ciclesonide is a new-generation corticosteroid currently used for the treatment of asthma and has been approved for the treatment of ar  <cit> . ciclesonide is administered as an inactive parent compound and is activated by esterases to a pharmacologically active metabolite, desisobutyryl-ciclesonide   <cit> . esterification of des-cic at the carbon- <dig> position produces reversible lipid conjugates of des-cic that represent a pool of active drug available for sustained long-term anti-inflammatory activity  <cit> . studies with ciclesonide in normal human bronchial epithelial cells and rat lung tissue and budesonide formulations used for treatment of ar in human nasal tissue have confirmed the role of fatty acid conjugates in prolonged retention of these drugs  <cit> .

the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ins are affected in part by the formulation of the suspension. intranasal corticosteroids are usually formulated and administered via an isotonic medium  <cit>  however, ciclesonide is formulated in a hypotonic suspension. the viscous consistency of the hypotonic suspension provides longer retardation of ciclesonide on nasal mucosa and a high local concentration of ciclesonide to increase its absorption into nasal mucosa  <cit> . this may lead to enhanced uptake of ciclesonide in nasal mucosa and higher local tissue concentrations of des-cic compared with traditional isotonic ins suspensions, theoretically decreasing systemic availability.

formulation differences exist between ins based on the type of preservative used  <cit> . unlike other ins that usually contain benzalkonium chloride as the preferred preservative agent  <cit> , ciclesonide hypotonic suspension is formulated for intranasal use with potassium sorbate as the preservative agent  <cit> .

the major aim of these preclinical studies in rabbits was to compare the metabolism of ciclesonide to its active metabolite, des-cic, after intranasal administration as a hypotonic or isotonic suspension and to investigate the retention of ciclesonide and des-cic and nasal mucosal formation of fatty acid conjugates of des-cic up to  <dig> h after intranasal administration of a hypotonic suspension of ciclesonide. ciclesonide and des-cic were analyzed in homogenates prepared from the nasal mucosal tissue using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. a comparative analysis of data obtained from rabbit nasal mucosa after intranasal administration of hypotonic or isotonic suspension is reported herein.

RESULTS
ciclesonide uptake and formation of des-cic in rabbit nasal mucosa
mean nasal mucosal concentration of des-cic was significantly higher after administration of the hypotonic suspension compared with the isotonic suspension at all time points  <dig> -fold,  <dig> -fold, and  <dig> -fold higher at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> min, respectively, after administration; p <  <dig>  for all; table 1; fig. 2). ciclesonide levels were measurable in all the nasal mucosa samples only at  <dig> min after administration of isotonic suspension. however,  <dig> and  <dig> of the  <dig> samples were below the lower limit of quantification at  <dig> and  <dig> min, respectively. by contrast, when administered in hypotonic suspension, ciclesonide was measurable in the nasal mucosa at all time points . the concentration of ciclesonide was  <dig> -fold higher at  <dig> min and  <dig> -fold higher at  <dig> min after administration of the hypotonic suspension compared with the isotonic suspension . moreover, the concentration of ciclesonide was significantly higher at  <dig> min  after administration of the hypotonic suspension compared with the isotonic suspension .

concentration-time profile of des-cic in nasal mucosa
the concentration-time profiles of des-cic in nasal mucosa in the hypotonic and isotonic suspensions were distinctly different. for the hypotonic ciclesonide suspension, a relatively high amount of des-cic  was detected in the nasal mucosa  <dig> min after administration compared with  <dig> min  after administration . in contrast, when administered in isotonic suspension, a negligible amount of des-cic  was detected in the nasal mucosa  <dig> min after administration compared with  <dig> min  after administration.

retention of des-cic and des-cic fatty acid conjugates in rabbit nasal mucosa
desisobutyryl-ciclesonide was measurable in the nasal mucosa at all time points up to  <dig> h  after administration of a hypotonic suspension of ciclesonide . the highest concentration of des-cic  was detected in the nasal mucosa as early as  <dig>  h after administration of ciclesonide, suggesting that ciclesonide is rapidly converted to the active metabolite. desisobutyryl-ciclesonide-oleate and des-cic-palmitate were measurable in the nasal mucosa at all time points up to  <dig> h after administration of ciclesonide. desisobutyryl-ciclesonide-oleate was the major fatty acid conjugate formed in the nasal mucosa, and the highest concentrations of des-cic-oleate  and des-cic-palmitate  were detected in the nasal mucosa  <dig> h and  <dig> h, respectively, after administration of a hypotonic ciclesonide suspension.

discussion
the intracellular localization and sustained concentration of ins are dependent to varying levels on nasal mucosal absorption, drug lipophilicity, glucocorticoid receptor affinity, and the ability to form lipid conjugates in nasal epithelial cells  <cit> . retention and formation of fatty acid conjugates of ins in human nasal tissue and its importance in treatment of ar have been reported  <cit> . in the present study, the in vivo uptake and activation of ciclesonide in a hypotonic suspension have been shown to be superior to ciclesonide's uptake and activation in an isotonic suspension. furthermore, it has also been shown that des-cic and fatty acid conjugates of des-cic are present in rabbit nasal mucosa up to  <dig> h after administration of ciclesonide in a hypotonic suspension.

nasal mucosal concentrations of ciclesonide were numerically higher after administration of a hypotonic suspension compared with an isotonic suspension and decreased after  <dig> min of administration. the presence of relatively higher amounts of ciclesonide versus des-cic  <dig> min after administration of the hypotonic suspension may be explained by better absorption of ciclesonide in hypotonic medium. the presence of relatively smaller amounts of ciclesonide  at  <dig> min after administration of the isotonic suspension suggests slow uptake of ciclesonide when administered in isotonic suspension. however, the nasal mucosal concentrations of des-cic were significantly and consistently higher  <dig> min after administration of a hypotonic suspension. there is limited data available on the influence of tonicity on nasal uptake  <cit> and tonicity is unlikely to have any effect on particle size distribution. however, previous studies in other systems have demonstrated that hypotonic formulations promote significantly greater absorption of water and sodium in the intestine  <cit> .

the presence of des-cic in nasal mucosa as early as  <dig> min after administration of hypotonic suspension suggests rapid conversion of ciclesonide. the identification of esterases present in nasal tissue is currently being investigated in human nasal epithelial cells; although intracellular esterases are highly conserved across the species, it would not be surprising to see minor differences in human nasal mucosa. preliminary evidence suggests that carboxylesterases and cholinesterases are involved in the metabolism of ciclesonide to des-cic in human nasal epithelial cells  <cit> .

our subsequent experiment with hypotonic suspension in rabbit nasal mucosa further corroborated the evidence of metabolism of ciclesonide and confirmed that des-cic is retained in nasal mucosa for  <dig> h after a single-dose administration. this study also confirmed the formation of des-cic-oleate and des-cic-palmitate conjugates of des-cic in nasal mucosa, reaching their highest levels  <dig> h and  <dig> h postadministration, respectively. the presence of fatty acid conjugates of des-cic suggests that the active drug may be retained in the nasal mucosa as a reversible pool to exert sustained drug effects over time and allow once-daily dosing. similar metabolism of ciclesonide to des-cic in normal human bronchial epithelial cells and rat lung tissue  <cit>  and the presence of des-cic-oleate and des-cic-palmitate fatty acid conjugates of des-cic for a longer period of time have also been demonstrated in rat lung tissue  <cit> . fatty acid conjugation has also been reported for budesonide in lung and nasal tissue  <cit> . however, des-cic-oleate is 5-fold more lipophilic than budesonide-oleate  <cit> .

the hypotonic ciclesonide suspension containing the avicel matrix used in this study diffuses rapidly into nasal mucosa because of a difference in osmolarity between the suspension and the nasal mucosa  <cit> . diffusion of water and subsequent loss of water into the nasal mucosa lead to increased viscosity of the suspending agent and higher adherence to nasal mucosa. this higher adherence of the suspending agent leads to rapid accumulation of ciclesonide in the nasal mucosa and probable delayed clearance of ciclesonide . we hypothesize that initial conversion of ciclesonide to des-cic occurs almost instantaneously, whereas the subsequent conversion of des-cic to des-cic-oleate and des-cic-palmitate occurs slowly. theoretically, the interconversion of des-cic from the fatty acid conjugates may lead to relatively higher concentrations of des-cic within nasal mucosa for a longer period of time.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study confirm that a hypotonic ciclesonide suspension provides better absorption and results in higher cellular levels of ciclesonide and its active metabolite, des-cic, in nasal mucosa compared with an isotonic ciclesonide suspension. the presence of des-cic and fatty acid conjugates of des-cic in the rabbit nasal mucosa up to  <dig> h after a single administration provides a rationale for the investigation of ciclesonide nasal spray administered via a convenient once-daily dosing regimen for the treatment of ar.
