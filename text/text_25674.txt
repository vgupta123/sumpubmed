BACKGROUND
the number of completely sequenced bacterial genomes, including those of many pathogens, now stands at  <dig>   <cit> . such an extensive database provides not only the opportunity to define conserved open reading frames  through a comparative genomics approach, but also whole-genome sequence information necessary to construct representative libraries of cloned orfs, or 'orfeomes', to enable large-scale, high-throughput 'omics' applications. in the case of hospital- and community-associated methicillin-resistant staphyloccocus aureus  strains, which are causing significant morbidity and mortality worldwide  <cit>  the availability of an orfeome should lead to an improved understanding of the molecular networks governing virulence, pathogenesis, and antibiotic resistance for the control and treatment of s. aureus infection  <cit> .

the complete genome sequence of s. aureus strain mu <dig>  <cit>  encodes  <dig> protein-coding orfs . the massive undertaking to clone orfs by the thousands cannot be easily achieved by conventional methods using restriction endonucleases. therefore, we have used the gateway® site-specific recombinational cloning system  <cit>  to construct an s. aureus orfeome library of  <dig> unique orfs  in 'entry' vectors. such entry vectors permit orfs to be easily shuttled into other vector types; for example, into protein expression vectors to investigate protein-protein interactions by the yeast 2-hybrid  assay  <cit> . we verified the quality of our s. aureus orfeome library by pcr amplification and dna sequencing. to demonstrate its functionality, we tested the production of his-tagged and gst-tagged recombinant proteins in e. coli. additionally, we performed a y2h analysis of  <dig> randomly chosen s. aureus orfs to test for protein homodimerization, a property which is necessary for the correct functioning of many proteins.

our repository of s. aureus orfs offers a highly flexible platform with which to undertake high-throughput genomic and proteomic studies of s. aureus and mrsa infection, including the molecular mechanisms involved in transmission, virulence, immune-escape, and antibiotic resistance.

RESULTS
the overall strategy we have employed for construction and characterization of the orfeome of s. aureus is summarized in figure  <dig> .

primer design
in addition to a 20- to 30-nucleotide-long orf-specific sequence, each pcr primer was designed to generate a gateway®-compatible attb <dig>  or attb <dig>  recombination site  <cit>  flanking the amplified orf . full-length attb sites at the 5' and 3'ends were generated using secondary universal adapter primers in the same pcr. a one-step adapter pcr method was used, instead of the common two-step adapter pcr procedure, to reduce the required cloning steps . to allow for the production of c-terminal fusion proteins, which can be expressed from appropriate destination vectors, the stop codons of each orf were omitted in the reverse primers. shine-dalgarno  and kozak  consensus sequences were incorporated into the forward primers such that the atg in the kozak sequence is in frame with the attb <dig> site, thus allowing n-terminal fusion proteins to be produced from destination vectors that contain n-terminal tags.

gateway® recombinational cloning
the pcr products were inserted into the gateway®-compatible vector pdonr™/zeo  by bp-cloning. the products resulting from site-specific recombination were transformed into e. coli. a portion of the cells was plated on solid medium containing zeocin™, and the remainder was used to inoculate liquid medium containing zeocin™ to generate bacterial stocks of pooled entry clones for long-term freezer storage. on solid medium, ~90% of the plates yielded at least  <dig> colonies; lower numbers were obtained with inserts > <dig> kb. a single colony from each plate was tested in a colony-pcr with pdonr™/zeo-specific primers. the resulting pcr products were detected by gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. transformants which had an insert of the expected size were picked and grown in liquid medium containing zeocin™ to generate bacterial glycerol stocks for long-term freezer storage. by this approach we obtained  <dig> transformants carrying the correct insert, which represents 65% of the  <dig> predicted orfs. using both the positive single-colony glycerol stocks to inoculate liquid medium containing zeocin™ and the liquid glycerol stocks for those orfs for which no positive single-colony isolate was obtained, cultures were grown in 96-well plates and plasmid dnas were prepared and used for pcr. for  <dig>  samples, an insert of the size expected for the orf was observed. the remaining 5% yielded a pcr product of ~ <dig> bp, derived from empty pdonr™/zeo vector. in light of this result, we expect that additional positive single transformants may be present in the liquid glycerol stocks. the single-colony glycerol stocks, the glycerol stocks of the pooled transformants, and the purified plasmid clones together constitute the orfeome of s. aureus.

validation of entry clones by dna sequencing
to verify that the inserted orfs are in the correct reading frame and indeed correspond to the assigned identity, we took a random sample of  <dig> plasmid preparations and subjected them to sequencing with a pdonr™/zeo-specific forward primer. all  <dig> samples were found to be correctly inserted, and a blast search of each sequence against the s. aureus mu <dig> genome  confirmed the identity of each orf.

validation of entry clones by recombinant protein production
another random sample was used to show expression of proteins from the cloned orfs. forty different entry clones were each subjected to a recombination reaction, the lr-reaction, which recombines the attl-sites on the entry clones with the attr-sites on the destination vectors  <cit> . twenty of the orfs were shuttled into the pdest™ <dig> vector  designed to make a fusion protein with a gst-tag, and the other  <dig> entry clones were used in an lr-reaction with the pdest™ <dig> vector , creating fusion proteins with a  <dig> × his-tag. the resulting products were transformed into the bl <dig> protein expression strain of e. coli. after induction of protein expression with iptg, the cells were lysed and  <dig>  μg total protein from the crude lysates were analyzed by western blot and antibody detection with biotin-linked anti-his and anti-gst antibodies. protein was expressed from all  <dig> of the gst-tagged proteins and  <dig> of the  <dig> his-tagged proteins .

yeast two-hybrid homodimerization screen
numerous proteins must undergo homodimerization before they can carry out their functions. for example, many receptors in metabolic pathways are homodimers or form homodimers after ligand binding. in fact, screening for new ligands or ligand-competing drugs is sometimes performed by assaying for homodimerization  <cit> . as a functional test of our s. aureus orfeome library, we shuttled  <dig> entry clones into gateway®-compatible y2h destination vectors to screen for homodimerization in yeast. after transforming ah <dig>  cells with dna binding domain  vectors  and y <dig>  cells with activation domain  vectors , colonies growing on each plate were mated on ypd plates. yeast colonies appeared on  <dig> plates deficient in the reporter supplements adenine and histidine, and in the vector-encoded amino acids tryptophan and leucine, indicating  <dig> putative homodimers . however, the y2h system is prone to autoactivation artifacts, in which a protein expressed from a single vector, rather than as protein-protein dimer from complementary bait and prey vectors, is able to reconstitute a functional transcription factor to permit growth of the yeast. therefore, tests for autoactivation were done to identify such false positives. for this test, ah <dig> yeast cells transformed with db vectors were plated on nutritionally selective medium deficient in tryptophan, adenine, and histidine. y <dig> yeast cells pre-transformed with ad vectors were mated with yeast ah <dig> transformants containing an empty db vector and plated on nutritionally selective medium deficient in tryptophan, leucine, adenine, and histidine. thirty-seven of the original  <dig> putative homodimers failed this test ; moreover, the same results were obtained in the added presence of  <dig> mm 3-amino- <dig> ,3-triazole , a more stringent growth condition . we consider the remaining  <dig> newly discovered homodimerizations to be genuine protein-protein interactions in s. aureus . to obtain support for this assumption, we searched the literature for reports of dimerization involving homologs of these  <dig> proteins in other species. we found that at least  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins have highly conserved dimer-forming homologs , based on biochemical and structural data.

discussion
the orfeome of s. aureus that we constructed in this work consists of  <dig> orfs maintained as homogeneous plasmid dnas purified from single colonies plus  <dig> orfs purified from separate 'pools' of entry clones. these  <dig> cloned orfs represent 95% of the s. aureus  orfeome, a proportion of coverage similar to those reported for the orfeomes of three other bacterial pathogens, brucella melitensis  <cit> , treponema pallidum  <cit> , and francisella tularensis  <cit> . pcr amplification of the orfs produced products not only of the expected size, but also shorter ones, which were probably primer dimers  <cit> . although we did not purify the pcr products as in other orfeome projects  <cit> , enough material was produced for individual bp reactions, all of which resulted in colonies after transformation. testing of the effectiveness of both purified and unpurified pcr products in bp reactions showed that cloning could be achieved to the same extent with both types of pcr products. to minimize the occurrence of pcr-induced mutations, we optimized the pcr conditions, used a proofreading-capable dna polymerase, and kept the number of amplification cycles low.

entry clones are the basis for further experiments using recombinational cloning, including genome-wide protein-protein interaction  analysis, protein expression, and protein localization studies  <cit> . the single entry clones are of higher quality than the pools of entry clones because they are homogeneous, and lr reactions performed subsequently with the pure clones will be more efficient. however, for reasons of economy and because of time constraints, it was not possible to screen every colony to obtain a pure isolate of the appropriate orf-containing entry clone. when the first colony-pcr failed to produce the anticipated orf, we screened the remaining pool of colonies to identify the presence of the expected entry clone. we failed to produce pcr products for  <dig> orfs. this could be due to possible errors in annotation of the mu <dig> genome or, more likely, because of nucleotide differences between our clinical s. aureus isolate and the sequenced mu <dig> genome or for technical reasons related to primer design and effectiveness specific to each missing orf.

different strains of s. aureus can exhibit important differences in gene content owing to the presence/absence of plasmids and/or mobile elements integrated into the chromosome , usually at specific loci termed "genomic islands"  <cit> . such factors are important determinants of mrsa virulence and drug resistance, so that an ideal orfeome would include orfs for these genes in addition to the bacterial core orfs. our orfeome is certainly incomplete in this regard, because it is a composite of only two s. aureus strains; however, orfs for virulence and resistance factors of interest could easily be added to the orfeome as the resource is further characterized and developed.

we assessed the quality of the orfeome by pcr and agarose gel-electrophoresis of the pcr-products for all the entry clones obtained. sequencing a sample of  <dig> pcr products confirmed the identity of the entry clones. functional validation was done by recombinant protein production and ppi analysis using the y2h system. in addition to identifying  <dig> new homodimeric interactions, the experiments also showed the functionality of the orfeome and its suitability for further applications, including automated high-throughput protein purification or orfeome-wide ppi analysis. indeed, generation of an s. aureus intrapathogen 'interactome' is conceivable through orfeome-wide ppi screening of  <dig>  million  protein-protein interactions by automated procedures. likewise, a system-wide screen for host-pathogen ppis could be conducted by screening against other available orfeomes, e.g. the human orfeome  <cit> , which would produce a detailed description of the host-pathogen interface at the molecular level, leading to improved understanding of s. aureus pathogenesis in humans.

production of recombinant proteins in the present system is achieved with the two well-known protein fusion tags,  <dig> × his and gst. these tags could be used for further protein purification or affinity studies such as gst pull-down  <cit>  for validation of protein-protein interactions. we successfully produced fusion proteins with both types of tags, although the gst-tagged proteins were more strongly expressed on average than the his-tagged ones in our experiments. his-tagged proteins could not be detected in three out of  <dig> experiments by western blotting, due to high background staining caused by the his-specific antibody used or because of low expression rates, or both. although, we loaded equal amounts of total e. coli protein lysates on protein gels, the intensity of the expressed proteins varied because of degradation in the crude cell lysates. it is interesting to note the presence in some experiments of a second band double the size of the expected molecular weight, suggesting homodimerization, although it is unlikely that dimerization would occur under the denaturation conditions used.

we tested  <dig> proteins for homodimerization using the y2h-system and found a total of  <dig> such interactions  after ruling out  <dig> autoactivators. all y2h-experiments, including the autoactivator tests, were performed in triplicate, and each ppi was reproducible by independent analysis. it is important to stress that even in the cases of autoactivation, an orf had to have been expressed in the yeast reporter strain, which again demonstrates the functionality of the orfeome. the  <dig> homodimers observed here imply that at least ~15%  of the tested proteins can undergo homodimerization, consistent with the levels found in previous large-scale studies  of different organisms [s. cerevisiae  <dig> %, c. elegans  <dig> %, d. melanogaster  <dig> %, and h. sapiens  <dig> %  <cit> ;  <dig> homodimers among  <dig> ppis  in h. sapiens  <cit> ;  <dig> homodimers in  <dig> human ppis   <cit> . moreover, in the literature we found reports of biochemical and/or structural evidence for homodimerization among homologs  of  <dig> of our  <dig> dimer-forming proteins . for example, rnase iii, the product of the sav <dig> clone, is a homodimer in numerous species  <cit> . in s. aureus, rnase iii is an essential regulator of expression of the spa gene, which encodes the virulence factor staphylococcal protein a <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the cloning of 95% of the s. aureus orfeome was achieved, and a random sampling of orf-containing plasmid vectors showed the orfs to be functional in two different downstream applications: recombinant protein production in e. coli and a protein interaction assay . the availability of the s. aureus orfeome with appropriate gateway®-compatible destination vectors offers many possibilities for proteome-wide studies of such medically important phenomena as virulence and antibiotic resistance in a high-throughput manner. this first version of the s. aureus orfeome can be extended in future work by addition of the missing orfs.
