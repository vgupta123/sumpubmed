BACKGROUND
the importance of gibberellins  to angiosperm growth regulation has been demonstrated by the phenotype of ga-deficient mutants. the ga-deficient arabidopsis thaliana ga1- <dig> mutant that lacks ent-kaurene synthetase a, an enzyme in the ga biosynthesis pathway, exhibits a characteristic severe dwarf phenotype  <cit> . mutants such as ga1- <dig> are ga-sensitive dwarf mutants that have been observed in a number of different plant species and typically carry recessive mutations that reduce the activity of ga biosynthesis enzymes  <cit> . further molecular characterization of various ga response mutants led to the discovery of the gid <dig>  and della proteins, which are key components of the molecular ga-gid1-della mechanism that enables plants to respond to ga  <cit> . genetic and molecular studies have identified the ga receptors and several positive and negative components of the ga signaling cascade  <cit> . among them, the three major players are the ga receptors, the della repressor proteins, and the f-box proteins that control the stability of della proteins. ueguchi-tanaka et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that gid <dig> is a soluble ga receptor in rice . discovery of the molecular identity of the endogenous plant ga-opposable growth-inhibitory factor resulted from molecular cloning of the genes encoding what are now known as the della proteins.

the arabidopsis gai mutation confers dominant, ga-insensitive dwarfism  <cit> . an insertional mutagenesis approach has facilitated the molecular cloning of gai via isolation of a ds transposon-inactivated allele  <cit> . the gai open reading frame carries a small in-frame deletion mutation and thus encodes an altered product, a mutant gai protein that lacks a 17-amino-acid segment, now known as the della domain, named after its first five amino acids. molecular genetic analysis of ga-insensitive dwarf mutants has also identified an f-box protein  that is part of a della-interacting e <dig> ubiquitin ligase that interacts with a c-terminal region of the della protein  <cit>  and targets dellas for breakdown by the proteasome. della proteins are thought to repress plant growth, and gibberellins promote growth by overcoming the repressive effects of these proteins. the arabidopsis gai- <dig> mutant has a 51-bp deletion that encodes part of the conserved della domain. as mentioned above, the Δ-della form of gai acts as a gain-of-function mutant that can inhibit some components of the ga signaling pathway  <cit> . expression of arabidopsis gai in rice yields a dwarf phenotype, suggesting that gai is sufficiently conserved between plant families to allow it to function  <cit> .

haywood et al.  <cit>  have reported the long-distance delivery of rna for the arabidopsis Δdella-gai  genes. in grafting experiments, they demonstrated that the gai transcript specifically entered functional sieve elements and induced a highly reproducible change of leaf phenotype in tomato when atgai mrna was transported into the tomato shoot apex  <cit> . long-distance transport of the gai transcript in woody plants  has also been demonstrated  <cit> . ham et al.  <cit>  reported that the polypyrimidine tract binding motif within the gai mrna is involved in the formation of a mobile ribonucleoprotein complex, and proposed the presence of motifs that are necessary and sufficient for long-distance trafficking of the gai transcript. furthermore, huang and yu  <cit>  reported that the trafficking of gai rna is mediated by specific rna motifs existing among coding sequences and the 3′-untranslated regions.

experiments using a grafting system have provided long-distance transport of several transcripts across a graft union, such as cmpp <dig>   <cit> , cmnacp   <cit> , pfp  -let <dig> <cit> , stbel <dig>   <cit>  and aux/iaa <dig> <cit> . however, no details of the molecular mechanism involved, especially the physiological function of the gai mrna transport system, have been clarified. in the present study, we characterized gai mrna transport through phloem using atgai transgenic tobacco as the experimental material. the results proved that a wt scion on atgai rootstock contained the atgai protein and that its growth reflected attenuation of the expression of many ga response genes.

RESULTS
atgai transgenic tobacco exhibits dwarfism and lower sensitive to ga3
transgenic plants over expressing atgai and showing a dwarf phenotype have been demonstrated in tomato, tobacco and apple  <cit> . since atgai mrna has been shown to be transportable through phloem, a t-dna construct harboring a construct expressing atgai  driven by a companion cell-specific promoter  was integrated into n. benthamiana by agrobacterium transformation. cgt transgenic tobacco plants clearly exhibited a semi-dwarf phenotype and did not show accelerated growth from  <dig> days after planting, as was the case for wt plants. even after ga treatment, the cgt plants showed only a small increase in stature, being about one fourth that of wt plants .

cgt rootstock affects wt scion growth
to determine whether cgt rootstock affects growth of a wt scion as a result of atgai mrna transport, grafts consisting of a wt scion and a cgt stock  and a cgt scion and a wt stock  were treated with ga <dig> . self-grafted wt and cgt plants  were also prepared. these grafted plants were grown on soil in pots and sprayed with water with or without ga <dig>  the ga-treated wt/wt and wt/cgt combinations showed a typical ga response phenotype: rapid elongation, a slender growth form, and yellowish leaves, but the response of the cgt/cgt combination was not so obvious . moreover, the shoot stature of wt/cgt was approximately half that of wt/wt, indicating that the wt scion grafted on cgt was less sensitive to ga <dig> 

using hydroponic culture, as shown in figure  <dig>  the growth rates of the graft shoot and root were measured precisely. the cgt rootstock reduced the stature of the wt scion, and the cgt scion also reduced the length of the wt rootstock . to observe the effect of cgt on the grafted partner’s mass, shoot and root fresh weights for four graft combinations were measured. the combination showing the highest mass for both the shoot and root was wt/wt, followed in order by wt/cgt, cgt/wt, and cgt/cgt . histograms were constructed  using these individual graft data. although variability among the growth rates of individual grafts was evident, cgt obviously reduced the growth rate of the grafted wt scion.

transport of atgai mrna through the graft union
any effect of cgt rootstock on the wt graft would be caused by long-distance transport of atgai mrna through the graft union. to confirm this, rt-pcr was used to detect the mutant mrna in the grafted material. thirteen wt scions out of  <dig> wt/cgt paired combinations showed amplification of a clear atgai product of the predicted size,  <dig> bp , indicating that long-distance transport of atgai transcripts had occurred in some grafts, whereas no product was detected in  <dig> wt/wt paired combinations. to quantify the transported atgai mrnas, we chose six wt/cgt scions at random and tried to detect the atgai transcript in them using qrt-pcr . three of the six wt scion samples clearly showed an amplified product; the others showed a very small amount of the amplified product that was detectable only by qrt-pcr. sequencing of the amplified fragments confirmed that they were derived from atgai, thus demonstrating that transport of the mrna through the graft unions varied among individuals.

detection of atgai-t <dig> protein in the scion of the wt/cgt combination
since atgai mrna was shown to be transported, we tested whether the mrna was also present in wt scions grafted onto Δ-della-atgai rootstock. the scions of wt/wt and cgt/cgt homogeneous grafts were used as negative and positive controls , respectively. leaves from five scions of the wt/cgt combination, in which atgai mrna had been positively detected, were harvested carefully and analyzed by western blotting using a t7-tag antibody . a clear band closely matching the predicted size  of atgai-t <dig> was detected in the wt scion grafted on the cgt stock. although it was considered that atgai mrna was transportable from the cgt stock to the wt scion and then translated into protein in the scion tissue, the movement of the protein itself from the stock to the scion is also a possibility.

attenuation of the ga response of the wt scion on cgt stock revealed by microarray
to investigate in detail the ga response of the scion on cgt stock, microarray analyses were performed using three mrna samples obtained from the scions of the wt/cgt, wt/wt, and wt/wt combinations , and differences in the resulting changes of gene expression among the *wt/wt  vs *wt/wt and *wt/cgt  vs *wt/wt combinations  were compared. out of  <dig>  unique genes, genes exhibiting changes in expression of over  <dig> and below  <dig>  in at least one of both combinations were removed. the remaining  <dig>  genes were selected, and their changes in expression were plotted on an x-y scattergram, where the x axis = *wt/wt vs *wt/wt and the y-axis = *wt/cgt  vs *wt/wt . the regression line from all plots approached the x-axis, with a slope of  <dig> , indicating that the ga response of genes in the *wt/cgt  combination was weaker than that of genes in the *wt/wt  combination. in order to confirm this, the data from all  <dig>  genes were separated into  <dig> classes according to the degree of the change in expression , and the distributions of the numbers of genes were compared between *wt/wt vs *wt/wt and *wt/cgt  vs *wt/wt. the change in expression in the former case showed that  <dig>  genes  and  <dig>  genes  exhibited enhanced and reduced expression, respectively. on the other hand, the change in expression in the latter case showed that  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes exhibited enhanced and reduced expression, respectively. in total,  <dig> genes  showed a class e change in expression . these results clearly demonstrated that the wt scions on cgt stocks had fewer genes whose expression was altered in response to ga treatment, resulting that the cgt rootstock attenuated the ga response in the wt scion.

atgai apple rootstock reduces the stature of the scion cultivar
malus prunifolia is a non-dwarf-type apple rootstock used predominantly in japan. we attempted to transform m. prunifolia by introducing the atgai gene by the agrobacterium method. several putative transgenic lines were obtained in two transformation experiments. through propagation of the shoots on a medium containing the selection marker, only one line  was confirmed as transgenic by southern blot hybridization . the limitations of obtaining a single transgenic line was likely due to the low transformation efficiency in malus species and the effect of the atgai introduced, suppression of ga signaling. the atgai- <dig> m. prunifolia exhibited a semi-dwarf phenotype with reduced sensitivity to ga treatment, as is the case for cgt tobacco . moreover, the grafts between atgai- <dig> stock and scions of the apple variety 'orin’ showed a clearly reduced shoot stature . although these results are based on a single transgenic apple line, the data are consistent with the results in tobacco.

discussion
lack of the della domain of gai results in constitutive activation of a mutant growth inhibitor whose genetically dominant action can no longer be opposed by ga. since gai is a semi-dominant and gain-of-function mutation  <cit> , integration of gai into wt results in a semi-dwarf phenotype, and this has contributed to the green revolution  <cit> . the stature of several crops, including rice  <cit> , chrysanthemum <cit> , tobacco  <cit> , and apple  <cit> , has been reduced by transformation with Δdella-gai , as is the case for the arabidopsis gai- <dig> allele. in all cases, Δdella-gai  was expressed under the control of camv 35s .

on the other hand, gai mrna is able to move through phloem, and is considered to function at the site to which it has been transported  <cit> . as plasmodesmata connect the functional enucleate sieve elements of the phloem to their neighboring companion cells  <cit> , this pathway is considered to allow the selective entry of information macromolecules into the phloem translocation stream. in this study, the atgai transgene was delivered via the promoter of a plant virus, coymv, which is expressed strongly only in companion cells  <cit> . intriguingly, the cgt transgenic tobacco plants also exhibited semi-dwarf phenotypes, as was the case when the 35s promoter was used, indicating that expression of atgai only in companion cells can induce a definite dwarf phenotype. therefore, it is suggested that the gai transcript in companion cells acts non-cell-autonomously to regulate the growth of plants. furthermore, the less sensitive ga response of the wt scion on cgt rootstock strongly indicated the non-cell-autonomous effect of the gai transcript. in higher plants the system of gai mrna transport through the phloem might function to integrate growth modalities among plant organs  <cit> . in our experiments, not only the integrated atgai but also the extant n. benthamiana gai were considered to be transported by the same molecular mechanism. detailed analysis of the transport of both gene transcripts via the graft union would be expected to clarify the physiological role of gai mrna long-distance movement.

approximately one-fourth of the grafts we examined did not show the rt-pcr product derived from the gai mrna transported from the stock. long-distance transport of rna in sieve tubes appears to be mediated by rna-binding proteins. ham et al.  <cit>  identified rna-binding proteins involved in mrna transport, and proposed a model in which a ribonucleoprotein complex moves in the phloem. it is clear that rna also binds to chaperone proteins for stability and delivery to target tissues  <cit> . as a matter of course, such large complexes must pass through the graft union, where vascular bundles are developed in the callus . de novo passage through the sieve tube tends to be unorthodox, showing features such as a winding path, thus disrupting the passage of large ribonucleoprotein complexes, and in extreme cases such complexes would become clogged. since the conductance of a vessel is proportional to the fourth power of the vessel radius , a slightly reduced diameter would pose an obstacle to passage. on the other hand, grafting of many horticultural crops is a well-developed technology, and this phenomenon in such plants might be less problematic, suggesting that they can establish near-complete connection of the sieve tube at the graft union as the growth progressed.

no other report has identified the translated protein derived from the transported gai mrna in grafting experiments. in the wt scion on the cgt stock, the gai protein fused with the t7-tag peptide was clearly detectable. its amount was considered to be approximately one-third of that in the cgt stock, suggesting effective translation of the gai mrna in the scion. however, there is a possibility that the protein might have been translated in companion cells and then moved through the graft union. for clarification of this issue, a high-accuracy experiment to detect the gai protein in sieve elements would be necessary.

our present microarray experiment was also the first of its kind to investigate the long-distant distance transport of mrna in grafted plants. the overall results clearly revealed that the wt scions on cgt stocks had fewer genes whose expression was altered in response to ga treatment than in the wt scions on wt stocks. it is known that ga has pronounced effects on overall reproductive growth from flowering to fruiting  <cit> . therefore, although we succeeded in growing a dwarf apple tree using the atgai rootstock, the effect of this manipulation on subsequent fruit development will require careful investigation. however, semi-dwarf cultivation of many crops might be feasible using atgai-expressing rootstock. furthermore, the application of not only gai but also other phloem-transportable mrnas  <cit>  might become possible by means of grafting. finally, the present results imply that a non-genetically modified scion is capable of improvement by a genetically modified rootstock, and consequently, the fruits of the plant would not contain the inserted dna sequence. grafting using gene-modified rootstock is expected to become a focus of interest as an innovative approach to agriculture  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study has demonstrated for the first time that transgenic stock expressing a Δdella-gai gene by the companion cells specific-promoter is able to transfer the gai-mrna to a wild-type scion. furthermore, this study provides the first evidence that the translated product of the gai mrna is present in the scion. in addition, microarray data clearly indicated that many ga-responsive genes in the wild-type scion on Δdella-gai stock show attenuated responses.
