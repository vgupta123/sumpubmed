BACKGROUND
chrysanthemum  is the second most commercially valuable ornamental species after rose  <cit> . a serious production constraint is represented by black spot disease  wiltsh)  <cit> . the disease is most damaging during humid, warm conditions, which makes it a year-round problem for greenhouse-based production  <cit> . severe infections damage the commercial value of the plant, as they cause leaf necrosis, and reduce the quantity and quality of the flowers  <cit> . little is known regarding the chrysanthemum/black spot host-pathogen interaction. however, in the host-pathogen system involving the model species arabidopsis thaliana and the related pathogen a. brassicicola, the pathogenesis-related protein pr <dig> is significantly up-regulated  <cit> . in the tomato/a. alternata system, the ethylene , jasmonate  and salicylic acid  signalling pathways are all activated as part of the host response  <cit> , while the response of mint to a. alternata infection features many proteins related to stress and defence  <cit> . finally, egusa et al.   <cit>  have shown that the transcription of the genes pgip  and ppo  is induced in the leaf of the japanese pear when challenged by a. alternata. plant defence responses are first activated in the organs located at the site of infection but are then extended to the uninfected systemic  organs, activating a systemic acquired resistance  which is effective against a broad spectrum of pathogens in the whole plant  <cit> . however, limited studies have examined the induction of sar in chrysanthemum/black spot host-pathogen interaction, so far. in the present study, the systemic responses are expected by surveying gene expression profiles in the noninfected  leaves.

rna-seq technology has been developed to enable the simultaneous sequencing of very large numbers of short reads, and in so doing has revolutionized the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the transcriptome  <cit> . when applied to cotton infected with a wilt pathogen, of the > <dig>  genes identified by mapping the reads to a genomic sequence assembly, over  <dig>  were found to be up- or down-regulated as part of the defence response  <cit> . similarly, an analysis of the banana-fusarium oxysporum interaction successfully demonstrated the up-regulation of genes involved in hormone synthesis, pathogenesis-related genes, transcription factors and signalling/regulatory genes  <cit> . finally, the lettuce-botrytis cinerea interaction has been shown to feature the induction of genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway and in terpenoid synthesis, as well as a global down-regulation of genes responsible for photosynthesis  <cit> .

in present study, we aimed to 1) elucidate the localized responses to the infections on the inoculated site by comparing libraries generated from mock-inoculated and inoculated leaves; 2) to describe the systemic response by comparing libraries generated from neighbouring leaves from mock-inoculated and inoculated leaves. the present study reports the outcome of a rna-seq based analysis of the chrysanthemum-a. tenuissima interaction. the experiment has yielded information regarding the identity of the genes which are either up- or down-regulated as part of the defence response. the majority of the differentially transcribed  genes were involved in either pathogen recognition, reactive oxygen species detoxification, cell wall modification or phytohormone signalling, but also a range of transcription factors, belonging to various families were identified. validation of the rna-seq data was provided by subjecting a set of  <dig> of the dt genes to quantitative rt-pcr .

RESULTS
analysis of rna-seq libraries
the major characteristics of the four libraries  are summarized in table  <dig> and additional file 1: figure s <dig>  the number of raw reads per library ranged from ~ <dig>  to ~ <dig>  million, and the total number of base pairs sequenced from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig>  . after removal of reads including adaptor sequence, reads in which >10% of the bases were uncertain, a total of, respectively  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads were obtained, corresponding to  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> base pairs . the proportion of clean reads was > <dig> % in each library .

read mapping
a reference gene database  which included all known chrysanthemum morifolium unigene sequences was used to map the rna-seq reads. based on the chosen criteria,  <dig> % of the clean reads recognized sequences in this database . on a per library basis, the proportions of the clean reads uniquely mapped to the database were, respectively,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %. in addition, the proportion of the clean reads from library d uniquely mapped to the publicly available a.tenuissima database was  <dig> %. the number of genes identified increased with the number of reads, but above  <dig> , <dig> reads no further genes were detected, implying full saturation of the transcriptome .

go classification of dt genes
of the  <dig> genes classified as dt genes in the contrast between library a  and b ,  <dig> could be assigned a go classification; the equivalent number for the a vs c  contrast was  <dig> out of  <dig>  for the b vs d  contrast  <dig>  out of  <dig> , and for the c vs d contrast  <dig> out of  <dig> . furthermore, of the  <dig> genes classified as dt genes in the contrast between library a and c ,  <dig>  behaved similarly between a vs c and b vs d; the equivalent number for the b vs d contrast was  <dig> out of  <dig>  . for the a vs b contrast, seven genes were categorized as “cellular component”, six as “molecular function” and  <dig> as “biological process”; the respective distributions in a vs c, b vs d and c vs d were ten, ten and  <dig>  nine,  <dig> and  <dig>  and nine, nine and  <dig> . the frequency of dt genes was highest in the contrast b vs d. the commonest molecular functions of the dt genes in this contrast were binding and catalytic activity; in terms of cellular component, most were associated with cells, cell parts, macromolecular complexes, membranes, membrane parts, organelles and organelle parts; finally, in terms of biological process, the majority were associated with cellular processes, metabolic processes and the response to stimulus . signalling responses to or mediated by ja, sa and et were well represented, particularly those active in ja-mediated signalling. some transcription factors and cell wall modification genes were also differentially transcribed, as were genes involved in secondary metabolism . among the biological processes well represented among the down-regulated genes were those involved in photosynthesis. in the contrast between b and d, a small number of up-regulated genes belonged to the categories ‘cell killing’, ‘positive regulation of biological process’, ‘membrane-enclosed lumen’ and ‘receptor activity’. a higher number of genes identified in this contrast were associated with ‘response to stimulus’ and ‘signalling’ than in the contrasts a vs b, a vs c and c vs d .

changes in transcription level
the distribution of unigene coverage in each sample was analysed as a way of evaluating the quality of the rna-seq dataset . the term “gene coverage” reflects the proportion of the full gene sequence represented by rna-seq reads. for most of the unigenes, gene coverage was >50%. the transcription level of each unigene  was derived from the number of relevant reads recovered following mortazavi et al.   <cit> . dt genes  were identified using an algorithm developed by audic et al.   <cit> . between a and b,  <dig> genes were up- and  <dig> down-regulated, between a and c, the totals were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, between b and d,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively and c and d,  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively .

transcription factors, cell wall modification genes and genes involved in ja and sa signalling were all regulated by a. tenuissima inoculation
the transcription data indicated that infection by a. tenuissima regulated a number of transcription factors and genes associated with pathogenesis and ja and sa signalling. three members of the gras-type transcription factor family were more abundantly transcribed in the inoculated than in the mock-inoculated leaves. when qpcr was performed on a selection of the  <dig> of the dt genes to validate the conclusions drawn from the rna-seq analysis, all the genes behaved as predicted. most of the genes examined  were induced after a. tenuissima inoculation . the qpcr analysis suggested that genes involved in cell wall modification, ja and sa signalling and transcription factors comprised a network of interactions, providing the host with a capacity to fine-tune its disease response.

all these genes were significantly up- or down-regulated . the rpkm data were obtained from the rna-seq analysis and the relative level of transcript abundance from the qpcr analysis.

discussion
global patterns of transcription in response to infection by a. tenuissima
the chrysanthemum genome is polyploid and large, so has not as yet benefited from comprehensive and integrated genomic and transcriptomic sequence analysis. the molecular basis of its defence response against pathogen infection is currently poorly understood, but the advent of high-throughput sequencing technology now allows an unprecedented opportunity to explore it. about 70% of the reads in each of the four rna-seq libraries were mappable back to known transcripts , a proportion which is somewhat lower than achieved in the lettuce/b. cinerea system  <cit> , probably reflecting the more comprehensive status of the lettuce transcriptome. the 30% of reads which were not mappable are presumably associated with as yet unidentified transcripts  <cit> . the validation through qpcr of the transcripts identified as regulated by a. tenuissima infection showed that the rna-seq method is well suited for the analysis of transcription induced as part of the defence response in chrysanthemum . in all,  <dig> dt genes were identified in the a vs c contrast and  <dig>  in b vs d . a comparison with the outcomes of the lettuce/b. cinerea and a. thaliana/b. cinerea interactions  <cit>  showed that only two genes were up-regulated in all three systems, namely lsa <dig> , at1g <dig> and unigene7965_all  and lsa <dig> , at4g <dig> and unigene17395_all . during the early phase of both the lettuce/b. cinerea and the a. thaliana/b. cinerea interactions, genes in the et pathway are heavily involved in the defence response, a finding which was replicated in the chrysanthemum/a. tenuissima interaction. the rna-seq data further show that a large number of genes are involved in the host response between six and 72 h post inoculation, including several genes involved in the ja and sa pathways. some of these are discussed in more detail below.

pathogen recognition-related genes modulated by a. tenuissima infection
plant pattern recognition receptors  perceive microbe-associated molecular patterns , a set of molecular signatures encompassing whole classes of microbes. this recognition initiates a basal level of immunity   <cit> . receptor-like kinases , which form the largest plant receptor family, are prrs localized at the plasma membrane  <cit> . the involvement of rlks in certain host-pathogen interactions has been well documented experimentally  <cit> . the rna-seq-based transcriptomic analysis of the lettuce/b. cinerea interaction has revealed that several types of rlk are differentially transcribed  <cit> , and the same phenomenon was recorded in the chrysanthemum/a. tenuissima interaction. the damage caused by microbes can induce the host to synthesize mamp-like products, termed damage-associated molecular patterns   <cit> . oligogalacturonides  released from the plant cell wall activate the damp-associated response. the induction of an og receptor wall-associated kinase  has been suggested as being necessary for the survival a. thaliana challenged by pathogen infection  <cit> . five wak-like kinases  were among the dt genes detected in the b vs d contrast , and a sixth  was identified in the a vs c contrast . another study showed that waks were involved in the immune responses against b. cinerea. furthermore, transgenic plants overexpressing wak <dig> conferred resistance to b. cinerea in a. thaliana <cit> .

genes encoding a second class of prr, the leucine-rich repeat rlks , are known to be involved in both basal and cultivar-specific host immunity  <cit> . in a. thaliana, bri <dig> encodes an lrr-rlk which forms a heterodimeric complex with a second lrr-rlk called bak <dig> acting as a negative regulator of microbial infection-induced cell death  <cit> . bak <dig> mutants develop spreading necrosis after the triggering of apoptosis by infection with b. cinerea <cit> . the transcription of two lrr-rlk , four bri-like , six bak <dig> genes , and two somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase  genes  was modulated by a. tenuissima infection in the b vs d contrast , as were an additional two bri-like , a somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase  genes , and four bak <dig> genes  in the a vs c contrast . all the above genes were up-regulated except for unigene18133_all. in the lettuce/b. cinerea interaction, one bri-like  gene was up-regulated, but no bak <dig> genes  <cit> .

the products of genes encoding cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases  are rlks which contain an extracellular cysteine-rich repeat domain. these genes are reportedly activated by oxidative stress, pathogen attack and exposure to sa  <cit> . although less widely researched, they have been characterized to be involved in the pathogen defense and programmed cell death in a. thaliana <cit> . here, three crks were identified as dt genes  in the b vs d comparison  and a further three  in the a vs c comparison . thus, prr-rlks are clearly involved in the chrysanthemum host response to a. tenuissima infection. the early activation of these genes may reflect their transcription as an attempt by the host to recognize mamps/damps.

ros  detoxification genes modulated by a. tenuissima infection
mamps are known to trigger the production of ros in response to pathogen infection, largely derived from nadph oxidase activity )  <cit> . two chrysanthemum rboh homologues were recognized: unigene300_all  and unigene45792_all ; both were differentially transcribed in the b vs d  and a vs c contrasts . the lettuce rbohd homologue  was induced 48 h after infection with b. cinerea, but its rbohf homologue  was not up-regulated  <cit> . in a. thaliana, both rbohd and rbohf are required for ros detoxification  <cit> . two further pathogen-inducible α-dioxygenases   were differentially transcribed in the b vs d contrast, and one  in a vs c ; this class of gene was also up-regulated in the lettuce/b. cinerea system; its product is involved in protecting the cell against oxidative stress  <cit> .

genes associated with photosynthesis were mostly down-regulated by a. tenuissima infection
dt genes involved in photosynthesis were uniformly down-regulated in the b vs d contrast, with the sole exception of unigene2020_all . in the contrast c vs d, four photosynthesis-related dt genes were detected, and all were down-regulated . the response mirrors the outcomes in the lettuce/b. cinerea and lettuce/verticillium dahliae systems  <cit> , as well as in other documented plant-pathogen interactions  <cit> . unigene6198_all, predicted to be involved in the determination of the plant’s circadian clock, was down-regulated in both the b vs d  and c vs d contrasts . similar examples of the suppression of such genes by pathogen infection have been described in both lettuce  <cit>  and a. thaliana <cit> . in the case of a. thaliana, b. cinerea infection appears to dampen the oscillating transcription of certain core clock components, leading to the suggestion that the pathogen attempts to dampen the host’s defence response, because a set of genes associated with plant immune responses was revealed to be regulated by the plant’s circadian clock  <cit> .

genes associated with cell wall protection affected by a. tenuissima infection
both pgip and ppo were up-regulated in response to a. tenuissima infection . pgip and ppo are known to respond to various cues  <cit> , including the presence of a. solani <cit> , a. triticina <cit> , a. macrospora <cit> , sclerospora graminicola <cit>  and colletotrichum lindemuthianum <cit> . pgip transcript abundance increased over the period 6–24 h after inoculation with a. tenuissima . many fungi secrete endo-polygalacturonase, an enzyme which degrades the polysaccharides present in the plant cell wall. host genes involved in the early defence response include those which help to reinforce the cell wall, and thereby inhibit pathogen entry. pgip’s role in mediating resistance to a. alternata infection has been shown in both rough lemon and japanese pear  <cit> , while the growth of b. cinerea is restricted in transgenic tomato heterologously expressing pear pgip <cit> . ppo transcription in chrysanthemum was enhanced after inoculation , similar to what has been observed in the leaf of japanese pear inoculated with a. alternata <cit> . in tomato, the constitutive expression of ppo increases host resistance to pseudomonas syringae, while its down-regulation enhances susceptibility  <cit> .

ja and sa signalling pathway-related genes involved in the response to a. tenuissima infection
cmjaz , cmmyc <dig> , cmvsp , cmnpr <dig>  and cmtga  were all induced by a. tenuissima infection . npr <dig> is a major component of sa signalling, functioning as a co-activator of the tga transcription factors known to regulate the transcription of various sa-responsive genes  <cit> . jaz  proteins repress ja signalling by binding to transcriptional regulators such as myc <dig>  the degradation of jaz proteins relieves the jaz-mediated repression of the ja signalling pathway and thereby activates a large number of ja responsive genes  <cit> . ja and sa both play an important part in host defence against herbivorous insects and microbial pathogens. in a. thaliana, vsp <dig> and pr- <dig> are, respectively, ja- and sa-responsive proteins  <cit> . overall, a number of genes within the ja and sa signalling pathways are involved in the defence response of chrysanthemum against a. tenuissima infection.

transcription factors responding to a. tenuissima infection
transcription factors are central to the control of the timing and placement of defence response gene expression  <cit> . their mode of action is to first recognize and then bind to regulatory elements located in the promoter region of their target genes, thereby activating or de-activating their transcription. here, five classes of transcription factor  were identified among the dt genes responding to a. tenuissima infection. in a. thaliana, atmyb <dig>  atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> are all involved in the triggering of apoptosis and therefore resistance against biotrophic bacterial pathogens such as pseudomonas syringae <cit> . atmyb <dig> is required for resistance against b. cinerea and a. brassicicola <cit> . the transcription of atmyb <dig> has been associated with secondary cell wall formation  <cit> . here, one cmmyb copy , was prominently transcribed from 48 h after inoculation with a. tenuissima . therefore, it was speculated that cmmyb  may be involved in defence response to the necrotrophic fungus a. tenuissima through the regulation of secondary cell wall biosynthesis. modifications to the plant cell wall were already recognized as the potential mechanism of resistance, which was previously provided by the reports on the response of plants to fungal challenges  <cit> . a second cmmyb  was also up-regulated by a. tenuissima infection . in a. thaliana, atmyb <dig> reportedly responds to salinity stress and the exogenous supply of abscisic acid, eth and ja  <cit> , but not as yet to pathogen infection. therefore, it was speculated that this gene may be involved in defense response to the necrotrophic fungus a. tenuissima and may be also associated with aba and ja signaling in chrysanthemum. other transcription factors in the ap2/erf, wrky, nac and gras families were abundantly transcribed in the leaf following a. tenuissima inoculation. many reports have also indicated that four families of transcription factors: myb proteins, ethylene-responsive-element-binding factors , wrky proteins and nac proteins link to plant stress responses, such as pathogens  <cit> . little evidence has been provided to date regarding the participation of gras transcription factors in the defence response.

in conclusion, it was clear that infection with a. tenuissima induced a wide range of genes in the chrysanthemum leaf. the response involved a complex set of interactions between pathogenesis-related genes, genes in the ja and sa signalling pathway and transcription factors. a more detailed understanding of the identity of these genes will help to unravel the molecular basis of the defence response of chrysanthemum to a. tenuissima infection, and eventually lead to the recognition of candidates for the targeted genetic improvement of chrysanthemum.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we characterized the leaf transcriptome of chrysanthemum and provided the comparative dt genes involeved in the interaction between chrysanthemum and a. tenuissima. these findings provide a substantial contribution to existing sequence resources of chrysanthemum, and a strong basis for further characterization of gene expression profiles in the interaction of chrysanthemum and a. tenuissima. the majority of the dt genes were those involved in pathogen recognition, reactive oxygen species detoxification, cell wall modification, phytohormone signalling, and transcription factors belonging to various families were also identified, which will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlining direct response and induced systemic resistance of chrysanthemum to a. tenuissim.
