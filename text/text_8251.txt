BACKGROUND
triacylglycerides  is the main form of oil storage in many seeds, composed of fatty acids and glycerol, providing carbon and energy to support the establishment of seedlings after germination  <cit> . seed oils are not only a major food source for humans but can also serve as a desirable biofuel alternative to fossil oil worldwide  <cit> . many crops, such as sesame, soybean, rapeseed, maize, sunflower, cotton, etc., produce vegetable oils in their seeds. however, the composition and content of fatty acids among these crops vary greatly. the quality and utilisation of seed oils is determined by their fatty acid composition. saturated fatty acids, such as palmitic  and stearic acids , are stable and tolerant to heat and oxidation. certain unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic , linoleic , and linolenic  acids, are beneficial to human health but susceptible to heat and oxidation  <cit> . the biosynthesis of fatty acids in plants has been extensively documented, which increases the feasibility of efficiently genetically engineering the composition of fatty acids in seeds.

fatty acid biosynthesis in higher plants occurs in the chloroplasts of green tissues or in the plastids of non-photosynthetic tissues  <cit> . in higher plants, the desaturation of long-chain fatty acids is accomplished in sequential steps and begins with the conversion of stearoyl-acyl carrier protein  to oleoyl-acp, catalysed by stearoyl-acp desaturase   <cit> . oleoyl-acp is a precursor for the biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids  <cit> . the sad enzyme introduces the first double bond into saturated fatty acids and is located on the plastid stroma. therefore, sad regulates the amount of unsaturated fatty acids and the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in higher plants  <cit> . several sad genes from a variety of plants have been isolated and characterised . previous research has shown that the transference of a sad gene into brassica napus and tobacco significantly increases the content of stearic and oleic acids  <cit> . maize seeds possess low stearic acid and high oleic acid contents; although oleic acid is beneficial to human health, they are sensitive to oxidation and unstable under high temperature conditions. sad may serve as a useful tool for engineering maize plants that produce a balanced content of stearic and oleic acids in their seeds.

the content and composition of oil in maize is a quantitative trait. many qtls associated with the content and composition of oil have been identified and mapped . in our previous research, we combined two-dimensional gel electrophoresis  with mass spectrometry  to compare the abundant soluble proteins of early developing embryos in maize. we identified  <dig> proteins that showed significantly different expression levels between a high-oil  and a regular inbred line , including the zmsad protein  <cit> . the expression level of zmsad  was significantly higher in the by <dig> seeds than in the b <dig> seeds  <cit> . maize contains two copies of the zmsad gene, zmsad <dig> and zmsad <dig> that were isolated from by <dig> and b <dig> and mapped on bin <dig> - <dig>  and bin <dig> - <dig> , respectively  <cit> . the zmsad <dig> mrna level was high in the b <dig> embryos but low in the by <dig> embryos; conversely, the zmsad <dig> mrna level was high in the by <dig> embryos but low in the b <dig> embryos. zmsad <dig> is one of the major qtls that control stearic acid content  <cit> . zmsad <dig> is localized to the oilc <dig> qtl  and accounts for  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variation in kernel oil concentration  <cit> . because zmsad <dig> has a greater effect on oil content, we selected zmsad <dig> to modify the composition of stearic and oleic acid in maize seeds.

for the genetic engineering of seed oil composition, ideal promoters should show high transcriptional activity and seed specificity. the fatty acid elongation  <dig>  promoter is seed specific  <cit> . for example, when the fae <dig> promoter was used to control seed-specific overexpression of zmsad <dig>  the composition of fatty acids in arabidopsis seeds was desirably modified  <cit> . in this study, we tested the biological function and the potential application of zmsad <dig> in oil engineering. we transformed arabidopsis and maize with zmsad <dig> using agrobacterium-mediated transformation and particle bombardment, respectively, and succeeded in modifying the composition of fatty acids in maize seeds. our results suggest that the zmsad <dig> gene is a helpful tool for genetically engineering the composition of oil in maize or oil crops.

RESULTS
endogenous sad expression levels are altered in transgenic arabidopsis
we obtained the full-length cdna of zmsad <dig> from b <dig> using the 5’-race technique  <cit> . the zmsad <dig> overexpression , antisense zmsad <dig> , and zmsad <dig> rna interference  constructs were generated in the pbi <dig> vector , and their expression was under control of the fae <dig> promoter, a seed-specific promoter  <cit> . the constructs were then used to transform arabidopsis. to assess the expression levels of the exogenous zmsad <dig> gene in various arabidopsis tissues, qrt-pcr experiments were performed. in the transgenic zmsad <dig> lines , exogenous zmsad <dig> exhibited significantly high expression levels in mature seeds and immature siliques than in roots, stems, leaves, and petals . without the presence of zmsad <dig>  the expression of zmsad <dig> was undetectable in the wt and transgenic empty vector arabidopsis lines  . these results illustrate that the fae <dig> promoter drives high expression levels of zmsad <dig> in immature siliques and mature seeds.fig.  <dig> expression levels of exogenous zmsad <dig> in various tissues of arabidopsis. all of the experiments were performed with three biological replicates. in each transgenic line, approximately  <dig>  g of roots, stems, and leaves were collected from  <dig> plants. approximately  <dig>  g petals and  <dig>  g immature siliques were collected from  <dig> transgenic plants from each line. approximately  <dig>  g mature seeds collected from  <dig> transgenic plants were collected from each line. total rna samples were isolated from the above tissues. the expression level of zmsad <dig> was determined by qrt-pcr. the relative transcript levels were calculated using the arabidopsis actin <dig> gene  as the internal reference. each bar represents the mean ± sd of three independent biological replicates. student’s t-test was performed. *indicates p <  <dig> ; **indicates p <  <dig> 



the arabidopsis genome encodes seven homologous atsad genes: ssi2/fab <dig> , s-acp-des <dig>  , s-acp-des <dig> , s-acp-des <dig> , s-acp-des <dig> , s-acp-des <dig> , and s-acp-des <dig>   <cit> . an alignment analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of zmsad <dig> and the seven atsad genes was performed using clustalx. the deduced amino sequences  are highly conserved . a phylogenetic relationship analysis shows that zmsad <dig> shares greater homology with ssi2/fab <dig> compared with the other proteins . to assess the expression level of the arabidopsis endogenous atsad genes in the mature seeds, a qrt-pcr assay was performed. the results showed that ssi2/fab <dig>  s-acp-des <dig>  and s-acp-des <dig> were expressed at lower levels than the other atsad genes in the mature seeds. in all cases, the expression levels of s-acp-des <dig>  s-acp-des <dig> and s-acp-des <dig> remained unchanged upon introduction of a zmsad <dig> construct. the expression of s-acp-des <dig> was significantly decreased in both the transgenic anti-zmsad <dig> and zmsad <dig> rnai plants compared with the empty vector plant . the expression of ssi2/fab <dig> was slightly decreased in the transgenic anti-zmsad <dig> seeds compared with the control , although the difference was not statistically significant. the expression levels of ssi2/fab <dig>  s-acp-des <dig> and s-acp-des <dig> were significantly decreased in the transgenic zmsad <dig> rnai seeds compared with that of control . these results confirm that zmsad <dig> rnai and/or anti-zmsad <dig> suppressed the expression levels of ssi2/fab <dig>  s-acp-des <dig>  s-acp-des <dig>  s-acp-des <dig>  and ssi2/fab <dig> in the transgenic arabidopsis seeds.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of zmsad <dig> and seven arabidopsis atsad homologous genes. multiple protein sequence alignment analyses were performed using clustal x. the phylogenetic tree of the aligned protein sequences was constructed using mega  <dig>

fatty acid composition and content are modified in transgenic arabidopsis seeds
the compositions of fatty acids in the arabidopsis seeds of transgenic lines were analysed by gas chromatography, together with the transgenic pbi <dig> empty vector line as the control. the contents of various fatty acids are summarized in table  <dig> and additional file 3: table s <dig>  with seed-specific zmsad <dig>  the average content of stearic acid  was significantly decreased compared with control ; conversely, with seed-specific silencing using zmsad <dig> rnai, the average content of stearic acid  was significantly increased compared with control . however, the average contents of oleic acid in the anti-zmsad <dig>  and zmsad <dig> rnai  lines were lower than in the control . the average content of long-chain saturated acids  in the zmsad <dig> plants was moderately reduced relative to the control , whereas it was significantly increased in the zmsad <dig> rnai plants  . the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids was significantly reduced in the zmsad <dig> plants ; conversely, it was significantly increased in both the anti-zmsad <dig>  and zmsad <dig> rnai plants  . therefore, the seed-specific overexpression of the exogenous zmsad <dig> gene significantly reduced the content of stearic acid and the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids. the seed-specific down-regulation of endogenous atsad genes in arabidopsis significantly increased the content of stearic and long-chain saturated fatty acids and the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids, whereas it significantly decreased the oleic acid content.table  <dig> composition of fatty acids in the arabidopsis seeds harbouring the exogenous zmsad <dig>  anti-zmsad <dig>  or zmsad <dig> rnai constructs

introduction of the zmsad <dig> gene into maize
our results confirmed that the composition of fatty acids in the arabidopsis seeds was modified by the introduction of an exogenous zmsad <dig> gene and suppressed by zmsad <dig> rnai. because maize oils are one of the major polyunsaturated vegetable oils for human consumption and modification of maize oil composition carries tremendous implications in practical application, we expanded our experiments to maize to modify the composition of fatty acids in maize seeds. we individually transformed the zmsad <dig> and zmsad <dig> rnai constructs under control of the fae <dig> promoter into maize by particle bombardment. maize calli resistant to bialaphos selection were obtained after particle bombardment , and plantlets were regenerated from these calli. the plantlets with well-developed roots were transferred to a growth chamber . pcr and southern blot assays were conducted; the results confirmed that the zmsad <dig> gene was integrated into the maize genome . subsequently, positive zmsad <dig> and zmsad <dig> rnai t <dig> plants were crossed with inbred line a <dig>  the zmsad <dig> and zmsad <dig> rnai constructs were established in the a <dig> background  after five back crosses with the recurrent parent a <dig> followed by one self-pollination. we obtained four a <dig> and three a <dig> lines. the zmsad <dig> expression levels in the maize mature embryos were determined using qrt-pcr. the total zmsad <dig> expression levels  in the a <dig> mature embryos are higher compared with that of the control. in contrast, the zmsad <dig> expression levels in the a <dig> mature seeds are lower than that in the control, indicating that the zmsad <dig> rnai construct effectively suppresses expression of the endogenous zmsad <dig> gene in maize .fig.  <dig> expression levels of zmsad <dig> in the mature maize embryos. ten maize embryos were excised from the mature seeds of a <dig>  a <dig>  and a <dig>  total rna samples were isolated from mature embryos. the expression level of zmsad <dig> was determined for each sample by qrt-pcr. three biological replicates were performed. the expression levels were calculated using the maize actin <dig> gene  as the internal reference. each bar represents the mean ± sd of three independent biological replicates. student’s t-test was performed. * indicates p <  <dig> ; ** indicates p <  <dig> 



overexpression of zmsad <dig> changes the fatty acid composition in maize seeds
the composition of fatty acids in maize seeds was also analysed using gas chromatography. the contents of various fatty acids are shown in table  <dig> and additional file 5: table s <dig>  in a <dig> seeds, the percentage of oleic acid in total fatty acids is  <dig>  % , which is higher than the percentage of other fatty acids. in the a <dig> mature seeds , the average content of stearic acid  and the ratio of saturated to unsaturated acids  are significantly decreased compared with those of the a <dig> control  , indicating that seed-specific zmsad <dig> results in a decrease in the content of stearic and other saturated acids. on the contrary, seed-specific down-regulation of zmsad <dig> by rnai increases the average content of stearic acid  and decreases the average content of oleic acid  compared with those of the control  . the average content of long-chain saturated fatty acids and the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids are both significantly increased in the a <dig> mature seeds . conversely, the contents of oleic acid and long-chain saturated acids in the a <dig> mature seeds are not significantly changed compared with those of the control.table  <dig> composition of fatty acids in the maize seeds harbouring zmsad <dig> or zmsad <dig> rnai constructs

discussion
reverse and forward genetics are widely used approaches to identify genes of interest. our group has previously used a proteomics approach by conducting 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis to screen for differentially expressed proteins in the seeds of low and high-oil maize lines. among the proteins identified in this proteomics study, the zmsad protein is expressed at high levels in by <dig>  and at low levels in b <dig>   <cit> . therefore, we selected zmsad as candidate genes to determine their association with the amount and composition of fatty acids. subsequently, the cdna sequence of the zmsad  gene was also annotated by an in silico approach  <cit> ; the initial in silico gene prediction was further improved. two copies of the zmsad gene, zmsad <dig> and zmsad <dig>  were isolated by race from b <dig> and by <dig>  respectively, and localized on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the cdna and deduced amino acid sequences of zmsad <dig> and zmsad <dig> are highly homologous  <cit> . in our previous and current studies, the full-length cdnas of zmsad <dig> and zmsad <dig>  both under control of the fae <dig> promoter, were used to transform arabidopsis. overexpression of either zmsad <dig> or zmsad <dig> leads to a decrease in stearic acid content in arabidopsis seeds   <cit> . however, whether zmsad <dig> or zmsad <dig> is the major gene regulating stearic acid content remains unclear. later, through mapping, zmsad <dig> was confirmed to be the major qtl for the content of stearic acid  <cit> . therefore, reverse genetics combined with forward genetics proved to be an effective solution in this case.

stearic acid and oleic acid are regarded as two desirable dietary components of seed oil. stearic acid has a higher melting point and is more resistant to oxidation compared with unsaturated acids, rendering it suitable for cooking, roasting, and frying  <cit> . in addition, stearic acid has a neutral effect on total and low-density lipoprotein  cholesterol levels in the blood  <cit> . as a monounsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid is beneficial to human health  <cit> . in this study, we examined the feasibility of modifying the fatty acid composition of maize by elevating or suppressing the expression level of the zmsad <dig> gene. a <dig> seeds have a higher content of stearic acid and long-chain saturated acids and a lower content of oleic acid, whereas a <dig> seeds contain lower levels of stearic acid. however, the modified traits of a <dig>  including contents of stearic acid, long-chain saturated acids, and oleic acid, are not the exact opposite to those of a <dig>  the content of long-chain saturated acids was decreased in a <dig>  although the change was not statistically significant.

the contents of stearic acid and oleic acid are approximately  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively, in a <dig> maize; thus oleic acid is about  <dig> times higher than stearic acid in a <dig>  with the seed-specific overexpression of zmsad <dig>  the average content of stearic acid in a <dig> was significantly decreased  to  <dig>  %. the magnitude of this decrease in stearic acid content is small compared with the oleic acid content in a <dig>  it also resulted in an insignificant increase in the oleic acid content, insufficient to significantly improve the oleic acid content. similar results were also found in the arabidopsis transgenic zmsad <dig> plants. therefore, we hypothesize that introduction of multiple genes to engineer the fatty acid synthesis pathway is required in order to effectively modify the composition of multiple fatty acids.

the sad enzyme catalyses the desaturation of stearoyl-acp to form oleoyl-acp. zmsad <dig> is highly homologous to zmsad <dig>  <cit> , which indicates a functional similarity between the two genes encoding the proteins. however, zmsad <dig> is a major qtl for stearic acid, whereas zmsad <dig> is a qtl for oil content  <cit> . the difference in the biological functions of zmsad <dig> and zmsad <dig> may be associated with their expression levels and their genetic backgrounds. for example, the maize inbred line a <dig> contains endogenous zmsad <dig>  with the seed-specific overexpression of zmsad <dig>  the content of stearic acid and the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids were successfully modified in a <dig> mature seeds , suggesting that the elevated level of zmsad <dig> is an effective solution for decreasing the stearic acid content in the a <dig> background. the expression levels of zmsad <dig> allelic genes vary significantly in different maize genetic backgrounds. thus, inbred lines with high zmsad <dig> expression levels may be the best candidates for modifying the fatty acid composition by traditional breeding.

antisense and rnai approaches have been used to suppress the expression of endogenous genes and to modify fatty acid compositions  <cit> . however, the degree of gene silencing under rnai-mediated suppression is much higher than that under antisense-mediated suppression, particularly in heterozygotes  <cit> . in the present study, we individually introduced into arabidopsis the anti-zmsad <dig> and zmsad <dig> rnai constructs under control of the same fae <dig> promoter. however, the fatty acid modification in the arabidopsis transgenic anti-zmsad <dig> seeds was not consistent with that in the zmsad <dig> rnai seeds. we hypothesize that this discrepancy may be due to the degree of silencing of endogenous atsad between anti-zmsad <dig> and zmsad <dig> rnai seeds. among the  <dig> arabidopsis sad genes, si2/fab <dig>  s-acp-des <dig>  s-acp-des <dig>  and s-acp-des <dig> expression levels were significantly decreased in the transgenic zmsad <dig> rnai seeds, whereas only the s-acp-des <dig> level was decreased in the transgenic anti-zmsad <dig> seeds, which confirmed that the zmsad <dig> rnai construct is more effective than the anti-zmsad <dig> construct in silencing atsad genes.

all seven arabidopsis sad enzymes utilize c18:0-acp as the preferred substrate  <cit> , which indicates that these proteins can catalyse the desaturation of c18:0-acp to c18:1-acp. in arabidopsis transgenic zmsad <dig> rnai seeds, the ssi2/fab <dig>  s-acp-des <dig> and s-acp-des <dig> levels were significantly decreased, indicating that the c18:0-acp to c18:1-acp conversion step in fatty acid synthesis was suppressed. on the contrary, in anti-zmsad1arabidopsis seeds, although the s-acp-des <dig> level was significantly decreased, the ssi2/fab <dig> and s-acp-des <dig> levels remained unchanged. the unchanged ssi2/fab <dig> and s-acp-des <dig> levels probably compensated for the decrease of s-acp-des <dig> in anti-zmsad <dig> seeds, thereby resulting in no changes in the content of stearic and long-chain saturated fatty acids.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, zmsad <dig> and zmsad <dig> rnai constructs were transformed into maize; the composition of fatty acids was analysed in mature maize seeds using gas chromatography. with seed-specific overexpression of zmsad <dig>  the content of stearic acid and the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids are significantly decreased. down-regulation of zmsad <dig> results in increased levels of stearic acid and long-chain saturated acids and increased ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids, whereas the content of oleic acid is significantly decreased. we have demonstrated that the zmsad <dig> gene is an effective tool for modifying the oil composition of maize or oil crops.
