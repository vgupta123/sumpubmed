BACKGROUND
recent occurrences of pandemics like the severe acute respiratory syndrome  or avian influenza clearly underscore the threat and seriousness of global diseases. the steadily growing globalization makes it difficult to contain pandemics to a certain region. therefore, pandemic control is of highest importance to human health. unfortunately, the segmented nature of the genome of influenza viruses is very conducive for genetic shifts and their rapid spread across various genera augments genetic drift. for example, the human influenza pandemics in  <dig> and  <dig> were suggested to have been caused by re-assorted influenza viruses  <cit> . moreover, the h5n <dig> outbreak in hong kong in  <dig> has convincingly demonstrated the ability of an avian virus to make the transition from birds to humans directly without going through a perceived "permissible host". in particular, the h5n <dig> virus is believed to have acquired the hemagglutinin  gene from a/goose/guangdong/1/ <dig> h5n <dig> and a/teal/hong kong/w312/ <dig> h6n <dig>  while the internal genes were received from a/quail/hong kong/g1/ <dig> h2n <dig> or a/teal/hong kong/w312/ <dig> h6n <dig>  respectively  <cit> ,  <cit> . even though this particular strain was eliminated by culling millions of chicken, its ancestors remains circulating in aquatic birds.

this paper proposes a new approach to pandemic control by constantly monitoring molecular evolution at both macro level  and micro level  using comparative phyloinformatics. this can facilitate prediction of how these viruses are evolving in terms of spatial, temporal, and host dimensions, and therefore, allows for faster responses to new outbreaks as well as their diagnosis. however, corresponding phylogenetic tree construction algorithms suffer from long runtimes due to their high degrees of computational complexity as well as the large datasets involved. therefore, it is necessary to develop informatics based solutions that use suitable algorithms and take advantage of distributed computing technologies to make such studies feasible in a reasonable amount of time. furthermore, these solutions need to be integrated in a framework for pandemic control that is biologist-friendly. as a result, effective vaccines and antivirals can be designed more easily and within a shorter response time, since specific local strains can be targeted directly.

in this paper it is demonstrated how such a system can be developed using a new distributed workflow design system called quascade. as a proof of concept, results for an actual systematic phyloinformatics analysis of neuraminidase  genes of h5n <dig> isolates and influenza viruses are presented. various phylogenetic algorithms; i.e. upgma, neighbor-joining, maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and mr. bayes  <cit> , are compared with respect to their efficiency and accuracy in deriving biologically meaningful results. in particular, the presented study illustrates how these algorithms can be integrated in a unique user-friendly workflow in order to enhance the efficiency of a comparative phyloinformatic analysis.

the selection of the receptor destroyer na for this study is motivated by its following properties. na belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase family of proteins and catalyzes the cleavage of sialic acid residues from viral and cellular glycoproteins. its most important function is to remove the terminal sialic acids from ha in order to enable the virus budding. moreover, it helps the virus spreading through the system by additionally removing sialic acids from cell surfaces. in particular, since variations in the na gene can lead to the evolution of more potent strains, studying the molecular evolution of this gene using the latest algorithms and computing power is essential.

several isolated studies have been conducted since the h5n <dig> outbreak in late  <dig> to monitor the molecular evolution at gene and genome level  <cit> ,  <cit> . all these studies involve a phylogenetic analysis at one level or the other. however, no systematic efforts have been undertaken so far to evaluate the suitability of the used phylogenetic algorithms in yielding biologically meaningful results for the analysis of ha and na gene products of h5n <dig> viruses in particular and influenza viruses in general.

RESULTS
we have used the new quascade system to implement distributed workflows for comparative phyloinformatics using different algorithms. figures  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> show these workflows for distance-based algorithms, maximum parsimony algorithms and maximum likelihood algorithms, respectively. the workflows use clustalw  <cit>  to compute multiple sequence alignments and different phylogenetic algorithms from the phylip package  <cit> .

the most compute-intensive parts of each workflow  are executed in a distributed computing environment by simply multiplexing the data and using several instances of the respective programs. figures  <dig> and  <dig> show execution times of the workflows for varying numbers of processors and sequences. in summary it can be seen that the system can achieve linear speedups.

we have used the designed workflows for the phyloinformatics analysis of na in different populations of h5n <dig> in particular and in influenza viruses in general. the reason for choosing a protein-based phyloinformatics approach instead of a gene-based approach is to gain a better understanding of the molecular evolution of the gene product that makes this deadly virus spreading across different hosts. to perform this study, three protein data sets have been collected as follows.

 <dig>  a manual search of swissprot  <cit>  for na and h5n <dig> has revealed only four entries: q9waa <dig>  , q710u <dig> , q9q0u <dig> , and q9w7y <dig> .

 <dig>  a subsequent combined and refined search of swissprot with trembl  has resulted in  <dig> more protein sequences. the resulting group of  <dig> na sequences is used as the core group.

 <dig>  a medium sized dataset has been obtained comprising  <dig> entries pertaining to h5n <dig> na that were mined from the uniprot database  <cit> .

 <dig>  a macro dataset of  <dig> entries of na from all influenza a viruses has been obtained from uniprot.

these three datasets are shown in the additional files  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> 

phylograms obtained for the core group from the character based algorithms protpars  <cit>  and protml  <cit>  are shown in the additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  while phylograms obtained from the two distance-based algorithms are shown in the additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  the phylogram obtained by mr. bayes  <cit>  is displayed in figure  <dig>  p18269sial, a trypanosoan sialdase and q05jh9h9n <dig>  a na of the distantly related h9n <dig> virus have been used as members of an outlier group for the phyloinformatics analysis.

our phyloinformatics analysis with the core set has revealed a clear pattern: spatial clustering of the strains based on the particular geographical region rather than temporal clustering based on time scale or according to host range. the obtained trees for the medium-size data set are shown in the additional files  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the algorithms protpars, nj, and upgma were used. all these algorithms have been distributed using the above quascade workflows and deployed on a cluster of pcs. the utilized cluster consists of  <dig> nodes comprising  <dig> cpus. its detailed specification and architecture are shown in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  respectively. however, the algorithms ml and mr. bayes could not be run on the existing system with the medium dataset since it became apparent that these algorithms require further optimization in terms of distribution and/or more processing resources.

finally, in order to provide a global perspective of the molecular evolution of h5n1_na, the dataset of  <dig> sequences of influenza a viruses rather than h5n <dig> alone has been utilized. the objective of this macro level analysis is to signify the fact that this approach may lead to the nearest neighbors of some of the lethal clades which may be kept under observation for further evolution. again, the large dataset was analyzed using the three algorithms protpars, nj and upgma. the results obtained are shown in the additional files  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  as per the core and medium sized datasets, the macro dataset also conforms to the clustering of h5n1_na along the spatial lines rather than temporal or host range lines.

keeping the thai clade isolates in focus while analyzing the large dataset, the results obtained with protpars agree with the trend obtained so far. all twelve core sequences are mapped to the thai clade. besides these twelve, ten more sequences were found in this clade, whereby eight of them are fragments. the remaining two are actually complete sequences from thailand . however, they were annotated as neuramindase instead of neuraminidase  <cit> ,  <cit>  which explains why these two entries are missing in the core set. however, querying of uniprot with "influenza virus" and "na" as query terms has returned these two entries which are clearly captured and validated in our phyloinformatics analysis. zooming out of the thai clade has shown the vietnam clade as its nearest neighbor, followed further by the indian clade with vietnam strains as their neighbors. on the next higher level indonesian, malaysian and chinese clades are indicated as neighbors. it would be interesting to further study the indian clade and verify how closely the indian strains and vietnamese strains are related with respect to other genes and also at genome level. such an analysis may lead to the identification of the origin for bird flu in india. further analysis of the large dataset indicates h9n <dig> as the nearest clade to h5n <dig> and non-structural protein as nearest to na within the h5n1_na group. the overall tree includes isolates from h3n <dig> to h15n <dig>  a detailed analysis of each clade and sub-clade within this tree and with reference to the other two trees could lead to an understanding of h5n1's molecular evolution at global level.

discussion
the core set includes samples isolated over a time frame from  <dig> to  <dig> and represents globally distributed localities from thailand to bavaria, germany. all the phylograms have essentially yielded geographic based clustering rather than time based clustering. the seven distinct clades that were clearly demarcated are: thailand clade i , thailand clade ii , thailand clade iii , indian clade  scotland clade  bavarian clade , and china clade . it is interesting to note that the host range across these clades ranges from chicken to human consisting of  <dig> avian hosts and six mammalian hosts.

the clustering obtained using various algorithms has not shown any bias towards host based clustering. in fact, thailand clade ii consisted of a chicken, a cat, a tiger and a human. multiple sequence alignments using clustalw and rendered consecutively in bioedit  <cit>  have revealed the interesting and intriguing fact that the sequences of h5n1_na from the same strain, which have infected all these hosts, are identical . this observation indicates that even though na is critical in spreading the virus to different hosts by means of its receptor destroying capacity, it may not be the sole factor for deciding the divergent host range. accordingly a study was undertaken to monitor the phylogenetics of another critical protein, ha, and will be reported in a separate communication.

multiple alignments of all  <dig> sequences have revealed another interesting fact. as can be seen from additional file  <dig>  the earliest  isolates that were considered belong to the scotland clade which includes two isolates from chicken isolated in  <dig>  both of them share an identical sequence homology. however, the even more important point to note here is the existence of a  <dig> amino acid stretch from position  <dig> to  <dig> in these clades which gets deleted in strains that evolved temporally. this stretch of twenty amino acids is absent in the isolates isolated from regions outside china and hong kong from  <dig> onward. another important observation to note is that the goosander isolate from guangdong province of china isolated in  <dig>  retained the same stretch of  <dig> amino acids as the scotland clades but with more than  <dig> point mutations spread across the entire length. the deleted amino acid stretch included three n-glycosylation sites: nqsi, nntw, and nqty. the chinese isolate  retained all the glycosylation sites, whereas the two hong kong isolates have retained only the nqsi site but lost the other two. all the remaining  <dig> isolates have lost all the three glycosylation sites. poon et al.  <cit>  have shown the criticality of acquiring or losing glycan sites for effective viral spread in a study involving the phylogenetics of glycan interactions of the hiv envelop protein. a similar study is being undertaken by the authors of this work to evaluate the role of "lost" glycons in h5n1_na.

a quick perusal of the results obtained with the three algorithms  has confirmed the pattern obtained from the core set. the strains of h5n1_na cluster spatially rather than temporally or according to host. however, there are subtle differences amongst the outputs of the three algorithms with respect to their resolution. the clustering obtained using nj seems to be better resolved than the other two in terms of branch length and sub-speciation. a detailed analysis of the thai clade obtained by protpars also has revealed that all the sequences from the core set have been represented in this tree as well. the additional isolates are mostly fragments obtained through pcr amplification and uploaded to uniprot. an interesting aspect of this clade is the finding that the entry q5ep <dig>  is placed almost as an outlier in this group. it would be interesting to analyze the genealogies of vietnam and thailand clades and to verify whether there are any "bridging" isolates such as q5ep <dig> that may play an important role in the spread of this deadly disease across the globe. we have analyzed our medium dataset to confirm the pattern we obtained with the core set. a detailed analysis of each geographic clade with respect to the "bridging" isolates such as q5ep <dig> may reveal a global pattern of h5n <dig> spread.

CONCLUSIONS
global preparedness for h5n <dig> pandemic has been declared as the top priority of global health agencies such as cdc. in view of the ever escalating threat of the virus mutating to a human lethal form, it has become essential to constantly monitor the molecular evolution of this virus utilizing the latest and best phylogenetic algorithms.

the current study was undertaken with two objectives: one is to demonstrate the utility of a biologist's friendly high performance computing workflow system in analyzing large and complex biological datasets by deploying compute intensive algorithms in their parallelized version. the second objective is to analyze h5n1_na data, as a proof of concept, in such a workflow to understand the molecular evolution of this rapidly evolving virus.

we have demonstrated the utility of workflow systems by designing a pipeline that starts with data input by the biologist. once the relevant data is uploaded into the workflow the remaining steps are all automated. in particular these steps comprise starting with multiple alignments of sequences to the distribution of the output to various algorithms, distributing the relevant outputs to different servers in a distributed environment which is grid compatible, and finally visualizing the output. such a workflow system saves a significant amount of time and eliminates possible human errors in analyzing critical data.

in any phylogenetic analysis involving pathogenic viruses there are three clear possibilities of clustering behavior: spatial, temporal and host based. our analysis of h5n <dig> na data utilizing different phylogenetic algorithms have indicated a spatial clustering of this virus based on geographical distribution rather than temporal or host. of course, single gene product analysis is insufficient to arrive at any biologically relevant conclusion and, hence, we propose to do multiple gene and genome level analysis as our future work. however, even for a single gene analysis the computing power required is formidable and we have used this approach as a proof of the concept that high performance computing is a must for any meaningful phyloinformatics study. even with the limited amount of data, we have been able to find a clear pattern  and the importance of glycon sites. however, further detailed studies in conjunction with other proteins such as ha, polymerase etc., and also at gene and genome level, are required to draw firm conclusions. it is also true that interpretation becomes more difficult if the size of the trees becomes very large. in our experience, zooming onto a cluster of interest  with relative ease and quickness, using the quascade middleware is an attractive feature of our study. furthermore, the comparison of different algorithms simultaneously with the same input file is another attractive attribute.
