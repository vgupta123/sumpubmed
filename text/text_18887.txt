BACKGROUND
regulatory networks are known to underlie many biological processes, and therefore their characterization and analysis forms a central focus of systems biology  <cit> . despite their importance, relatively little is known about how regulatory networks are formed during evolution and shaped by natural selection.

one of the best studied regulatory networks in molecular biology is the "gal network", which is responsible for the inducible metabolism of galactose in budding yeast. in addition to being extremely well-characterized in s. cerevisiae  <cit>  it has also been the subject of a number of quantitative modeling efforts  <cit>  and evolutionary studies, which have revealed many interesting patterns of regulatory network evolution  <cit> . perhaps most general of these evolutionary paradigms is the duplication and divergence of function of an ancestral bi-functional gene. before the whole genome duplication , which occurred along the lineage leading to s. cerevisiae  <cit> , the gal network is thought to have employed the gal1/ <dig> protein to perform both an enzymatic and regulatory function. this bi-functional protein has been retained in species that diverged before the wgd  <cit> . following the wgd, the two gene copies of gal1/ <dig> were converted to a highly inducible enzyme   <cit>  and a weakly inducible regulatory protein   <cit>  in post-wgd species. recent work has demonstrated that these changes confer a growth advantage in galactose  <cit> , and suggested that gene duplication and subsequent neofunctionalization represented an example of how a regulatory network can overcome an adaptive conflict, whereby the network cannot improve in one aspect without impairing function in another.

here we set out to explore the consequences of evolutionary changes in the gal network using a model of the regulatory network  to relate specific sequence changes to changes in quantitative function. starting with experimentally characterized regulatory differences between the pre- and post-wgd gal genes , we inferred an ancestral organization of the regulatory network . simulations of the ancestral and s. cerevisiae networks show that gene duplication and specialization lead to elevated gene expression in the presence of galactose, and decreased gene expression in the absence of galactose, thus leading to an improved switch-like system in s. cerevisiae. we then use the model to explore the significance of the order in which a set of maximally parsimonious evolutionary events separating a post-wgd ancestor and s. cerevisiae occur, and find important consequences for the function and evolution of the switch. we introduce the idea of evolutionary paths in the space of possible regulatory networks and develop quantitative measures to compare paths. we find that there are evolutionary paths in the lineage to s. cerevisiae that optimize particular features of their constituent network intermediates, some of which have been shown to be directly related to fitness. perhaps more importantly, we find that it does not seem possible to optimize all network features in any single path.

RESULTS
a hybrid stochastic-deterministic modeling framework for examining the evolution of the gal regulatory network
in order to explore the functional consequences of evolutionary changes in the gal network, we sought a quantitative approach to relate these molecular changes to changes in network operation. because the evolutionary events of interest include variations in gene copy-number, changes in protein function, as well as changes in the number and spacing of cis-regulatory sequences, we required a modeling framework in which we could incorporate all these features and relate them to network behavior.

to model transcription/translation we modified and implemented a general physicochemical model of transcription regulation  <cit>  in a stochastic context. this allowed us to vary the regulatory features of promoters driving the gal genes and hence to predict the effects of evolutionary changes in the cis-regulatory sequence of a particular promoter. to model changes in gene copy number, we simply changed the corresponding probability of transcription, for example, to model a gene duplication event, we multiplied the probability of that gene's transcription by two. because of the difference in time scales and species numbers between transcription/translation reactions and protein-protein/galactose interactions  <cit> , we modeled the latter using a system of ordinary differential equations. in order to model the effect of evolutionary changes in protein function, we assigned different sets of reaction possibilities to new molecular species created during the evolution of the network.

hybrid approaches  <cit>  such as this permit the inclusion of gene expression noise  <cit> , multiple time scales, and variable system mass in biological models while making simulations computationally feasible. briefly, each step of the hybrid simulation algorithm consists of a stochastic part for the slow transcription/translation/degradation processes, and a deterministic part for the fast molecular interactions which is solved to equilibrium .

model parameters were chosen to reproduce the quantitative operation of the gal network in s. cerevisiae . typical traces from simulations are shown in figure 2b. protein distributions were obtained at equilibrium from  <dig> independent simulations of each variant network at constant extracellular galactose concentrations in the range  <cit>  m in the absence of glucose . the induction-response curve for s. cerevisiae in increasing concentrations of galactose displays the characteristic switch-like response  and fold-inductions in gene expression are consistent with previously published experimental data .

mean numbers of molecules +/- standard deviation is reported from equilibrium protein distributions of  <dig> simulations in very low galactose  or very high galactose .

reconstructing the operation of an inferred ancestral network
gal <dig> and gal <dig> are paralogous genes which have diverged after a wgd event in the lineage leading to s. cerevisiae from a common bi-functional ancestor, gal1/ <dig>  which serves as both the galactokinase and co-inducer molecule. it has recently been shown that the fitness of cells growing in galactose is related to the phenotype and operation of the gal network. the cis-regulatory evolution of gal <dig> and gal <dig> has led to a more efficient genetic switch by subfunctionalizing the processes and regulation of galactose phosphorylation and induction  <cit> .

to study the effects of these changes on the network's quantitative function we inferred an ancestral form of the network by removing the gal <dig> and gal <dig> genes from the s. cerevisiae network and substituting a bi-functional gal1/ <dig> gene driven by the ancestral promoter for klacgal <dig>  <cit> . we have assumed that the other ancestral regulatory genes have remained unchanged in function and copy-number compared to s. cerevisiae.

we find that, relative to the inferred ancestor, the number of gal1p  molecules in s. cerevisiae is increased in high galactose and reduced in very low galactose, which implies a more switch-like response in . at the same time, the number of gal3p  molecules is decreased in all conditions relative to the ancestral protein . thus, a single bi-functional gene seems to perform poorly in controlling the enzymatic and regulatory aspects of the network, consistent with experimental results  <cit> .

the effect of an evolutionary change on the quantitative function of the gal network depends on the network's evolutionary history
having established the quantitative differences in network function between the ancestral and extant gal network in s. cerevisiae, we next sought to explore the significance of the order of evolutionary events after the wgd on network operation.

five events were considered: the regulatory and functional divergence of the two gal1/ <dig> copies, and the loss of the gal <dig>  gal <dig>  and gal <dig> gene duplicates, according to the principle of maximum parsimony  <cit> . since we know that there was an ancestral genome duplication event, we expect each gene to have been at two copies in some ancestor. we then make the maximally parsimonious assumption that each other gene was lost once. this is the minimum number of evolutionary changes that could have occurred, though not necessarily the scenario that was actually followed. similarly, we know that there are three active promoter binding sites in the extant gal <dig> promoter, and three in the ancestral gal1/ <dig> promoter, so we assume that were no additional binding site gains and losses during the specialization of gal1/ <dig> to gal <dig>  likewise, we know that the gal <dig> promoter has a single binding site, so we assume that two sites in gal1/ <dig> were lost without any additional intervening binding site gains or losses. finally, since there is little data from other species to estimate parameter changes in the gal network, we have assumed that these either remained unchanged or have incurred small changes .

we simulated all  <dig> of the possible network configurations that can arise as combinations of the regulatory changes required for the ancestral network configuration to evolve to the extant configuration in s. cerevisiae . these networks link s. cerevisiae and its ancestor via  <dig> unique evolutionary paths. each path consists of  <dig> networks which are connected via the wgd event and a unique sequence of five evolutionary changes .

evolutionary changes, such as the wgd, gene duplicate loss, and specialization of gal1/ <dig> to gal <dig> and gal <dig> connect these networks along evolutionary trajectories to s. cerevisiae .

to evaluate the quantitative function of a network we considered the number of protein molecules at equilibrium in very low galactose  and conditions of very high galactose . we defined three network features of interest for further examination:

feature  <dig> "repression strength", is defined as the number of galactokinase molecules  in the uninduced state , such that a smaller number indicates better repression;

feature  <dig> "induction strength", is defined as the number of galactokinase molecules in the induced state , such that a larger number indicates stronger induction;

feature  <dig> "switch effectiveness" is defined as the number of co-inducers  in the uninduced state , such that a smaller number indicates a more effective switch.

changes in gene copy-number, protein function, and the number and arrangement of cis-regulatory sequences often resulted in significant changes in the network's quantitative function, as indicated by the differences in the steady-state galactokinase and co-inducer concentrations between the  <dig> network configurations . the magnitude and direction of these changes, however, depended both on the particular evolutionary event being effected as well as on the configuration of the network being changed - that is, on the history of evolutionary changes that a network has accumulated. for example, we found that loss of the gal <dig> repressor gene duplicate has a significantly smaller impact on repression strength if it occurs prior to the specialization of both copies of gal1/ <dig> . this is because gal80p-mediated repression of gal <dig> is much stronger than that of gal1/ <dig> due to differences in the promoter regions of the two genes.

quantitative assessment of the order of evolutionary changes reveals that there are evolutionary paths that optimize specific network features
all of the evolutionary paths in the space of possible regulatory networks terminate at s. cerevisiae and, as a consequence, eventually accrue identical changes in function relative to the inferred ancestral network. nevertheless, because the effect of an evolutionary change depends on the configuration of the network at that point in evolution, intermediate gal networks leading to s. cerevisiae occupy markedly different regions in functional space depending on the sequence in which evolutionary changes accumulate.

for each of the  <dig> evolutionary paths we applied a scoring scheme  which penalizes an evolutionary event at that intermediate if it does not result in the best possible change in the network feature being scored . we find large variations in these scores  confirming that different sequences of evolutionary changes lead to different quantitative network function in the evolutionary intermediates. of the three features considered, induction strength shows the smallest variation, perhaps indicating that there is the least potential for evolution in this axis .

the path that optimizes repression strength  consists of the sequence: specialization of gal <dig>  specialization of gal <dig>  loss of gal <dig> duplicate, loss of gal <dig> duplicate, loss of gal <dig> duplicate . the sequence: specialization of gal <dig>  specialization of gal <dig>  loss of gal <dig> duplicate, loss of gal <dig> duplicate, loss of gal <dig> duplicate, optimizes switch effectiveness. the sequence: specialization of gal <dig>  loss of gal <dig>  loss of gal <dig>  specialization of gal <dig>  loss of gal <dig>  optimizes induction strength.

we found that evolutionary paths where the two specialization events of gal1/ <dig> to gal <dig> and gal <dig> occur in close sequence perform well in maximizing repression strength and switch effectiveness for intermediate gal networks. path scores in these two features are negatively correlated  with the number of evolutionary events separating the specialization of gal <dig> and gal <dig> . in addition, paths where the second copy of gal <dig> is lost after all other evolutionary changes show significantly higher repression strength compared to other paths . it was also found that the group of paths where specialization of gal1/ <dig> takes place before any gene duplicates are lost has a higher average switch effectiveness score than paths where duplicates are lost prior to specialization . finally, we find a correlation  between how early gal <dig> specializes and the strength of induction , as well as a weaker correlation with how late gal <dig> specializes and the induction strength scores .

we next explored the relationship between the scores of the different features. evolutionary paths tend to maximize switch effectiveness scores and repression strength scores together . interestingly, however, paths cannot optimize induction strength and switch effectiveness/repression strength simultaneously . as a result, evolutionary paths may optimize switch effectiveness/repression or strength of induction, but not both features at the same time.

in the preceding sections, we have made the assumption that the parameters of the network remain the same as those observed or inferred in s. cerevisiae. however, in order to test whether the results presented above are sensitive to parameters, we have performed a series of perturbation experiments in which parameters were randomly modified during evolution and found that the observations presented were all recapitulated in the perturbed networks .

discussion
using a quantitative model of the regulatory network we were able integrate the wealth of experimental knowledge about the s. cerevisiae gal network with promoter swap experiments and to infer and simulate the operation of an ancestral form of the gal network. two of our observations are consistent with the report of increased fitness after promoter specialization  <cit> . first, our observation of a higher expression of gal <dig> relative to the ancestor could lead to an elevated metabolic capacity  for s. cerevisiae in high galactose, and therefore perhaps to increased growth rate. second, we observed a decrease in the number of protein molecules in the absence of galactose, which could lead to increased growth in the absence of galactose through a decrease in the energetic cost of protein synthesis  .

despite the apparent consistency between our results and the report of adaptive specialization along the s. cerevisiae lineage, we found it difficult to establish a rigorous relationship between the quantitative function of the network and the network's fitness landscape. for example, in order to understand the potential benefit of increased levels of gal <dig> expression, it is necessary to consider the impact of the galactokinase on the entire metabolic network  <cit> . in particular, consideration of the toxicity of the metabolic intermediates is important and greatly complicates this analysis  <cit> . perhaps even more difficult is that we do not know the relative importance to the population of the induced or uninduced states of the gal network. clearly, the amount of time that s. cerevisiae may spend exposed to galactose depends on the environment and history of the population. it is unclear if this information will ever be available to us.

analysis of evolutionary paths
our scoring of evolutionary paths in the functional space indicates that most potential phenotypic divergence takes place in the uninduced state . this is consistent with experimental findings that report a greater effect of cis-regulatory variation on gene repression than on induction  <cit> . we also found that no evolutionary path takes optimal steps  in every functional dimension at every network intermediate. in particular, we found that paths that maximized repression strength and switch effectiveness were sub-optimal with respect to induction strength.

interestingly, we note that gal networks in other extant species have specialized their gal1/ <dig> homologues, but have retained various duplicates. for example, s. bayanus and s. castellii have specialized forms of gal <dig> and gal <dig>  but s. bayanus has kept two gal <dig> copies and reacquired a tandem gal <dig> duplicate  <cit> , while s. castellii has kept two gal <dig> and gal <dig> copies  <cit> . according to our evolutionary path assessment, the specialization of gal <dig> and gal <dig> before the loss of regulatory gene duplicates, as well as the close proximity of these specialization events, improves switch effectiveness and repression strength. retention of the gal <dig> duplicate in both species is also consistent with better repression strength scores .

we speculate a possible explanation for these observations. the gal network allows for a larger phenotypic divergence in the uninduced state . the network's capacity to improve and, therefore, the growth advantage, is greater if networks follow the path of uninduced state optimization.

assumptions of the approach
our method of exploring the evolution of the gal network is based on several assumptions. first, in constructing the evolutionary paths leading to s. cerevisiae, we assume that the evolutionary distance between two gal network intermediates that are connected by a regulatory change is always constant - that is, we treat all evolutionary changes as equally likely to occur at each step of a path. second, we make the assumption that regulatory elements not present in s. cerevisiae were also not present in the ancestor. while network features not present in s. cerevisiae, such as a unique uas configuration on a gene promoter, could have existed in the ancestor or intermediate networks, we have constrained the network's regulatory space to include only those evolutionary events required under the assumption of maximum parsimony - which states that, when confronted with multiple evolutionary scenarios that explain some data, the scenario that requires the fewest evolutionary events is the most probable to have been followed  <cit> . third, while we attempt to model parameter perturbations during network evolution, we cannot exclude the possibility that mutations can occur that have very large effects on parameter values. potentially, experimental characterization of the gal network in other species  <cit>  could give an indication of such events, which could then be modeled as distinct evolutionary changes in the history of the gal network.

CONCLUSIONS
a hybrid stochastic-deterministic modeling framework has been used to explore the effect of regulatory divergence in the gal network following the whole genome duplication. we have shown that some evolutionary paths optimize distinct features of network operation and that intermediate gal networks in the lineage to s. cerevisiae could not have optimized all network features at the same time.
