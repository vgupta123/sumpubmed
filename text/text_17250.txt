BACKGROUND
ovine models for neurological application targeting the brain have been gaining momentum for providing translational information on therapeutic applications to humans. compared to small animal testing  <cit> , the ovine model of medical research provides important translational information that contributes meaningful insights to human studies. unlike pigs, which have a flat and thick skull  <cit> , sheep have a relatively round skull that provides comparable structural proximity to the human skull. with large brain volume and distinctive neuro-anatomical structures, the use of the ovine models has been continuing to expand in neuroscience research fields, for example, stroke  <cit> , epilepsy  <cit> , and brain injury models  <cit> . emerging therapeutic applications, such as non-invasive focused ultrasound surgeries to ablate soft/tumor tissue  <cit> , would also benefit from using the ovine model.

anatomical and functional neuroimaging techniques are widely used to characterize functional-structural correlates or any morphological abnormalities in the brain that are implied in various pathological processes. among various imaging modalities, magnetic resonance imaging  is advantageous in examining the brain anatomy compared to computerized tomography  which provides limited signal contrasts for soft tissue. mri, by utilizing a blood-oxygenation-level-dependent  endogenous contrast mechanism associated with local brain activations, can also reveal spatiotemporal pattern of regional brain function in response to external stimulation in anesthetized animals .

mri also offers information on the white matter  structures and their spatial orientations. diffusion tensor mri , introduced in the mid 90s  <cit> , uses multiple diffusion-sensitive pulsed-gradient pairs with differing directions that provide characterization of the diffusion of proton-bearing molecules along three orthogonal directions in each voxel. computed diffusion tensor eigenvectors represent the voxel-specific orthogonal principal axes of diffusion, in which each respective eigenvalue reflects the amount of diffusivity in these axes  <cit> . apparent diffusion can then be quantitatively analyzed, conveying intra-voxel information about the averaged local  water diffusion in the brain tissue. combined with tractography technique , therefore, dti offers information on macroscopic orientations in the wm tracts.

while these techniques have well been established and widely used in humans  <cit>  and animals  was conducted during photic stimulation  and tactile stimulation . the photic and tactile stimulations are some of the earliest stimulation modalities used in the context of fmri, and are widely adopted in studies involving humans  and small animals  <cit> . because these stimulation modalities can activate the primary sensory circuities  even during the anesthesia  <cit> , they are compatible with animal studies. besides fmri, voxel-wise apparent diffusion coefficient , along with fractional anisotropy  values were obtained using dti, and the spatial orientations of the corticospinal tracts and optic radiations were visualized using tractography technique.

discussion
the present study demonstrated the applicability of mr imaging for non-invasive neuro-functional assessment in a healthy sheep model. fmri was employed to examine the sensorimotor and visual cortex activated by external sensory stimuli in healthy sheep. the identified functional areas were in a good agreement with the areas probed by using cortical stimulation of the motor area  <cit>  and visual photic stimulation  <cit> . also, the measurements taken from dti  as well as the tractography showed the feasibility of examining the wm macrostructures.

the time-course of bold signals obtained from the sheep  showed contrast magnitude on the order of 2–3 %  and an onset response delay of 3–4 s, exhibiting similarities to the signals from humans . since the current fmri protocol  lacks the temporal precision to produce an accurate representation of the signal response delay, a study employing the use of a shorter tr  combined with the event-related designs  <cit>  would reveal more comprehensive information on the bold hemodynamic properties from the sheep. it is also important to note that the bold response is affected by the anesthetic depth or by type of anesthetic agents due to potential alterations of the hemodynamic response to the neuronal activation . further study is warranted to examine the effects of different anesthetic agents, other than telazol, such as propofol infusion , on the bold signal responses and the central nervous system in ovine species.

in the interpretation of the dti data, both fa and adc values from the rois in sheep  were qualitatively comparable to the data from healthy human adults reported by brander et al.  <cit>  . on the other hand, the fa values measured from sheep’s corona radiata  were comparable to those obtained from humans   <cit> . in the interhemispheric differences in sheep, there were no significant differences in both fa and adc values from the internal capsule and the corona radiata, while significant left/right asymmetries from those regions have been reported in humans  <cit> .

additionally, the fa values from the cc genu and splenium, which are typically shown to be greater than the values from the internal capsule and the corona radiata among humans  <cit> , were smaller than the values from other rois . we also noted greater adc values from these areas compared to the ones from humans. we conjecture that these discrepancies may be attributed to the partial volume effects caused by the relatively thick imaging slice  and large voxel volume with respect to the ovine neuroanatomy.

dti tractography successfully visualized the corticospinal tracts and optic radiations in sheep , but was inadequate to visualize other wm tracts such as the frontoparietal fasciculus, which are readily characterized through the human version of the imaging protocol. the insufficient image-resolution  and signal-to-noise ratio  were considered as the causes of the limited ability to track major wm tracts. the use of a head coil that is designed for a human head might also have resulted in the lack of snr of the acquired neuroanatomical data . the use of higher spatial resolution  combined with a dedicated head coil having smaller coil elements to boost snr  would be conducive to identifying small wm bundles in sheep. the use of a sheep-dedicated head coil would not only improve the snr but would also provide more homogenous signal sensitivity profile across the brain volume.

in the review of overall experimental procedures, we experienced a few technical difficulties, especially from the head movement of the anesthetized sheep during the mri session, which considerably reduced the quality of the image in couple of animals. although restrainers placed over the sheep head  were helpful in reducing the artifacts, bloating of the abdomen could have amplified breathing-related head motion beyond the restraining capacity. since ruminants are especially susceptible to bloating, the use of intubation would be beneficial to prevent the bloating of stomach during imaging procedures.

we also noted the artifacts in t <dig> images from the sheep , which were likely attributable to the vascular feature  that prominently exists in the ovine facial area but not in humans. the artifacts call for necessary countermeasures, such as introduction of additional flow-suppression  <cit>  or cardiac gating  <cit> , when using human-compatible imaging protocol on ovine species.

CONCLUSIONS
ovine model can provide a unique opportunity for testing new neurotherapeutic modalities that can potentially be translated to clinical applications in humans, for example, to focused ultrasound  brain stimulation technology which has shown evidences in neuromodulatory potentials in small animal models  <cit> . applicability of mri, fmri, and dti in the sheep brain, as demonstrated in the present study, could further enhance the range of utilization of an ovine model in the field of translational neuroscientific research targeting the brain.
