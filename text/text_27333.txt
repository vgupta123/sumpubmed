BACKGROUND

aspergillus is a saprophytic genus found in diverse environments  <cit> . some species, typically a. fumigatus, are causative agents of aspergillosis  <cit> . because the degree of virulence and susceptibility to antifungal agents are known to vary among species  <cit> , accurate identification of aspergillus species is a very important subject, especially in the field of clinical mycology.

the identification of fungal species has up to now been based on the morphological characteristics of colonies and filaments as observed by microscopy  <cit> . however, the morphology-based method suffers several drawbacks. it requires specialized skills and knowledge and is tedious and time-consuming work. nevertheless, some strains lack obvious characteristic features under laboratory conditions. to achieve objective identification, molecular biological methods based on the dna sequences of particular genes are increasingly being adopted. the internal transcribed spacer  regions between 18s rrna,  <dig> s rrna, and 28s rrna are regarded as “barcode regions” and are frequently used as biomarkers for species identification  <cit> . dna sequences that code housekeeping proteins such as β-tubulin  <cit>  and calmodulin  <cit>  are also often used for detailed molecular studies. to improve the resolution of species discrimination, combinations of multi-genes have been attempted. for example, a combination of two genes   <cit>  or four genes   <cit>  has been used to characterize a. fumigatus strains. multi-locus sequence typing , focusing on seven types of gene fragments, has also been applied to characterize a. fumigatus strains  <cit> . these dna-based methods provide a more objective evaluation than the traditional morphological method.

in the field of medical microbiology, much attention has been paid recently to the mass spectrometric technique of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry  as a tool for the rapid identification of fungal isolates  <cit> . maldi–tof ms has major clinical advantages, since it requires much smaller samples and the total process from sample preparation to data analysis is very rapid. this method is a type of mass spectral fingerprinting, for which mass spectral databases are commercially available from several mass spectrometer companies. the rapid identification and discrimination of clinical a. fumigatus isolates has been reported using this method  <cit> . several research groups have further attempted to discriminate aspergillus isolates at the species and strain level . however, welker  <cit>  has pointed out the following problems with this method in his review.  the general finding that the proteome is very dynamic in living cells and hence protein pattern expectedly could be subject to changes in response to growth conditions,

  doubts whether differences and similarities in mass spectral patterns are completely consistent with the established taxonomy,

  a lack of comprehensive databases covering all clinically relevant species.




furthermore, in the author’s opinion, the reported mass spectra of fungal samples sometimes show too few peaks when sample preparation is performed using the recommended protocol proposed by the manufacturers.

to overcome these problems relating to mass spectral fingerprinting, we have proposed a method using ribosomal proteins as biomarkers for microorganism analysis by maldi–tof ms . ribosomal proteins are typical housekeeping proteins and are abundantly present in microorganisms’ cells. prokaryotic  ribosomes consist of  <dig> kinds of ribosomal subunit proteins , whereas eukaryotic ribosomes typically consist of  <dig> rsps. the combination of subunit proteins and their structures are not influenced by culture conditions. because most rsps are basic proteins with higher proton affinity  and their masses are distributed in the range of ca.  <dig> -  <dig> kda, rsps can be easily observed in maldi mass spectra  <cit> . we have reported that the identification of bacterial species and classification at the strain level can be accomplished based on the expressed mass types of rsps . the masses of rsps used as biomarkers can be estimated from translational amino acid sequences of genome-sequenced strains, which can be obtained from public databases such as uniprot knowledgebase   <cit> . our proposed method is a form of molecular typing like mlst, based on bioinformatics. the biomarker rsps are a complex of typical housekeeping proteins. since the sequence variation of rsps observed as the peak shift on the maldi mass spectra results from molecular evolution, the results of identification and discrimination of microorganisms are assumed to phylogenetic ally. this is the crucial difference between our proposed rsp typing as “phylogenetic” method and the conventional mass spectral fingerprinting as “chemotaxonomic” method.

the aim of our project is to extend the rsp-based method to the identification of eukaryotic fungi. as the first step, we have investigated the actual state of information of rsps of fungi registered in public protein databases through the characterization of ribosomal protein fractions extracted from genome-sequenced a. fumigatus strains as a model  <cit> . in our previous paper  <cit> , we revealed that more than half of the amino acid sequences of rsps registered in the public databases were incorrect, due chiefly to mis-annotation of exon/intron structures. we were able to successfully correct the sequence errors using a combination of in silico inspection by sequence homology analysis and maldi–tof ms measurements. post-translational modifications such as acetylation and methylation could also be verified. in this way, the expressed masses of rsps observed under  <dig>  da could finally be confirmed.

as the next step, this paper describes the results of comparable characterization of rsps of eleven aspergillus species to establish biomarker references for the reliable identification of aspergillus species. first, verification and correction of the amino acid sequences of rsps and confirmation of post-translational modifications common to all sample strains were performed to accurately determine the expressed mass, as described in our previous paper  <cit> . rsps with appropriate intensity commonly observed in each strain were then selected as reliable biomarkers for the identification of aspergillus species. the selected rsps of each strain were categorized into “rsp types” based on their mass and used to construct a dendrogram. the resulting dendrogram was compared with that arrived at using the dna-based method; the reliability of the species identification and discrimination of this method was then assessed.

RESULTS
characterization of rsps of genome-sequenced aspergillus strains
in our previous paper  <cit> , the amino acid sequences of rsps in a. fumigatus strains were verified to compile the reference mass list of expressed rsps. we noted that more than half of the amino acid sequences in the public databases, such as uniprotkb  <cit>  and the ncbi protein database  <cit>  were incorrect. these errors could be corrected by a combination of in silico inspection using sequence homology analysis and verification of actual expressed masses of rsps by maldi–tof ms measurements. in this study, by applying this strategy, the amino acid sequences of rsps of ten genome-sequenced strains of aspergillus species were further verified and compared to build a reliable biomarker list for the identification of aspergillus species. the sample strains used in this study are summarized in table  <dig>  for rsps with amino acid sequences not registered in the public databases, corresponding gene sequences were manually identified in the genome sequence by referring to gene sequences of a. fumigatus strains. the genome sequence of a. viridinutans is not yet published, but the authors have annotated the rsp sequences manually. finally,  <dig> kinds of rsps whose molecular weights were under  <dig>  da were selected that are common to those already verified for a. fumigatus strains  <cit> . supporting information additional file 3: figures si- <dig> to si- <dig> show the mass spectra of each genome-sequenced strain . additional file 1: table si- <dig> summarizes accession numbers in public protein databases of ribosomal protein biomarkers of genome sequenced strains used in this study. here, the names of rsps are adopted from the yeast nomenclature system  <cit>  to prevent confusion in the rsp’s nomenclature. supporting information additional file 2: table si- <dig> summarizes the data of the rsps of ten genome-sequenced strains such as the accession number, post-translational modifications, corrected amino acid sequences, and corrected exon/intron structures .table  <dig> list of sample strains used in this study

the post-translational modifications were then confirmed by referring to already-reported modifications in eukaryotic rsps. details of the assignments of each modification are described in the supporting information . acetylation , methylation , and two hydroxylations  have been reported in several papers  and have also observed in a. fumigatus  <cit> . a mass shift of these rsps from the calculated sequence mass after taking into account n-terminal methionine loss was commonly observed in all sample strains . this result suggests these modifications to be evolutionarily-conserved modifications, at least in aspergillus species. in addition, s <dig> showed a common + <dig> da shift, suggesting two methylations. although this modification has, to our knowledge, not been reported before, two methylations of s <dig> were concluded to be common modifications in aspergillus species.

species identification using the rsp types
the amino acid sequences and the theoretical mass of rsps thus determined mostly varied among species. this finding strongly suggests that species identification can be performed using rsps as biomarkers. to make a reference table for the rsp typing, each rsp was classified into different types based on mass. for example, s <dig> has five types of different expressed mass, of which the peaks are distributed approximately from m/z  <dig> to m/z  <dig>  as shown in fig.  <dig> . for s <dig>  type i was first allocated to a. fumigatus a <dig> observed at m/z  <dig>  which was common with that of n. fischeri nrrl 181t, a. lentulus ifm 54703t, a. viridinutans ifm 47045t, and a. udagawae ifm 46973t. interestingly, these species belong to aspergillus section fumigati. the mass of s <dig> of a. clavatus nrrl 1nt was different from type i, so it was allocated to type ii. in the same manner, s <dig> of a. niger cbs  <dig>  and a. kawachii ifo  <dig> were allocated to type iii, that of a. flavus nrrl  <dig> and a. oryzae rib  <dig> to type iv, and that of a. nidulans fgsc a <dig> to type v. the type classification was conducted in the same way in other rsps. table  <dig> summarizes the mass and types of rsps of each genome-sequenced strain, in which the post-translational modifications were taken into consideration as affecting the mass in this list.fig.  <dig> expanded view of s <dig>  regions. a

the distribution of the rsp types shown in table  <dig> was then processed using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean  cluster analysis using a categorical coefficient. fig.  <dig> compares the dendrogram based on the rsp types  with that based on the β-tubulin gene sequence . among the aspergillus species used in this study, a. fumigatus, n. fischeri, a. lentulus, a. viridinutans, and a. udagawae are known to be genetically related species, belonging to section fumigati  <cit>  . interestingly, these five species form a cluster in the dendrograms based on both the rsp type  and the β-tubulin gene sequence . in these sample strains, eight rsps  of the analyzed  <dig> rsps  matched completely.fig.  <dig> dendrograms constructed based on rsp typing  and the dna sequence of β-tubulin 





aspergillus clavatus has been suggested to be closest to section fumigati as shown in the dendrogram based on β-tubulin . rsp typing  also shows the closest position of a. clavatus next to section fumigati. five rsps  of common eight rsps in section fumigati are also shared with a. clavatus.

the positions of a. niger, a. kawachii, a. flavus, a. oryzae, and a. nidulans are distinct from the cluster of section fumigati. the rsp types of these species show little in common with section fumigati species: only l <dig> of a. oryzae and a. flavus was common. of these species, pairs of ‘a. niger and a. kawachii’ and ‘a. flavus and a. oryzae’ are known to be very closely interrelated: a. flavus and a. oryzae are assumed to be ecotypes of the same species because they have only  <dig> unique genes, even when comparing the total genome sequences  <cit> . in the types of  <dig> rsps used in this study,  <dig> out of  <dig> rsps agreed between a. niger and a. kawachii and also 100% of rsps agreed between a. flavus and a. oryzae. the ratio of conformity between species thus appears to be reflected in the relatedness between species.

as discussed above, the dendrogram based on the rsp types shows relatively good concordance with the tree based on β-tubulin gene sequences  and with the tree arrived at by genomic analysis of aspergillus fungi  <cit> . this result suggests that rsp typing can perform accurate species identification that reflects molecular evolution. therefore, the dendrogram constructed by the rsp typing can be considered as a kind of phylogenetic tree.

the effectiveness of rsp typing for discriminating section fumigati strains
because sensitivity to antifungal agents differs between a. fumigatus and other species within section fumigati, accurate discrimination of these strains is very important  <cit> . however, traditional morphological analysis does not always accurately locate species within section fumigati, so misidentifications often occur. to overcome this problem, yaguchi et al. have characterized the species within section fumigati by molecular phylogenetic analysis using multiple genes  <cit> . on the other hand, as described in the previous section, rsp typing shows the potential of species discrimination within section fumigati. to reveal the effectiveness of this method, the strains of a. fumigatus, a. lentulus, a. viridinutans, a. felis, a. pseudoviridinutans, a. wyomingensis, a. udagawae, and n. fischeri belonging to section fumigati were characterized.

the distribution of the rsp types within species tended to be consistent, and the variation was assumed to be small. this allowed the typing of sample strains to be conducted using the mass list of the genome-sequenced strain. fig.  <dig> shows the result of upgma cluster analysis based on the rsp typing profile. in the dendrogram based on rsp typing, every species formed one general cluster.fig.  <dig> the result of the upgma cluster analysis of the rsp typing of the strains belonging to aspergillus section fumigati. abbreviations: al; a. lentulus, nf; n. fischeri, av; a. viridinutans, au; a. udagawae, ap; a. pseudoviridinutans, afe; a. felis, aw; a. wyomingensis, and afu; a. fumigatus





the rsp types of a. lentulus strains completely match those of the type strain. because a. lentulus was originally regarded as a sibling species of a. fumigatus, it has proved difficult to discriminate them morphologically  <cit> . several mass spectrometric strategies based on mass spectral fingerprinting have been able to discriminate these species  <cit> ; however, these reports do not record the criteria used for discrimination. our proposed rsp typing, on the other hand, can discriminate these species based on variations in rsps. the types of  <dig> rsps  differed from that of a. fumigatus, which can be used for discrimination between a. fumigatus and a. lentulus. interestingly, n. fischeri is very close to the a. lentulus cluster, in which only l <dig> was different from that of a. lentulus. this species is close to the a. fumigatus cluster in the case of the β-tubulin gene as shown in fig. 2b. such differences are likely to be caused by the difference in genes used: the tree compiled using rsp typing  is constructed based on a combination of the types of  <dig> rsps that reflect  <dig> different housekeeping genes.

rsp typing has demonstrated that a. udagawae strains form a relatively clear-cut cluster. although some rsp peaks were not detected clearly, moderate concordance with the reference mass of the type strain was confirmed. five rsps  are further matched completely to those of a. fumigatus, whereas three rsps  are totally different from the other species. these rsps can therefore be used to discriminate a. udagawae from other species. the three strains  were formerly reported as variant isolates of a. fumigatus  but were re-identified, using multiple genes , as a. udagawae  <cit> . in rsp typing, these strains are included in the a. udagawae cluster, supporting this re-identification.

in contrast to the high conformity of rsps in a. lentulus and a. udagawae, former a. viridinutans strains  do not form an obvious cluster. interestingly, the type strain of a. viridinutans  is located separately from other former a. viridinutans strains. the diversity of a. viridinutans has already been reported, and this species was divided into some species . the strains ifm  <dig> and  <dig>  ifm  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and ifm  <dig> were re-identified as a. pseudoviridinutans, a. felis and a. wyomingensis, respectively. in each species, the high conformity of rsps was indicated.

CONCLUSIONS
in the context of the ongoing conversion, on the basis of fungal taxonomy, from morphology to molecular phylogeny, molecular biological methods have been adopted for the identification and discrimination of fungal strains. to avoid misidentification of closely-related species, especially within section fumigati, the reliability of identification results increases on increasing the numbers of evaluation points . this gives maldi-tof ms great potential, since many proteomic peaks that assist with the identification of fungal species are processed. our proposed rsp typing represents the next generation of mass spectral identification/discrimination of fungal strains, in that it supersedes current mass spectral fingerprinting, which is simple pattern-matching without peak assignment.

the merits of rsp typing are  it requires no commercial database and  it can be used to perform phylogenetic analysis. as for the first point, rsp typing requires reference to the rsp biomarker lists, via the internet, constructed from the public protein databases. at this time, of course, commercial mass spectral databases are more substantial than available rsp information. however, as whole genome-sequencing of fungal species progresses, information on rsps is expected to expand exponentially in the near future. although we initially encountered a confused situation as concerns the protein information registered on the public protein databases, we have successfully corrected the errors in the amino acid sequences and the names of representative aspergillus rsps. the sequences and expressed mass of rsps of other fungal species can now be easily verified and corrected by homology analysis using the sequence list summarized in supporting information additonal file 2: table si- <dig> 

the second benefit of this method is valuable, because the identification results have a phylogenetic rationale: they relate to a combination of more than a dozen housekeeping proteins. this method can eliminate the influence of growth and experimental conditions, if only the rsp peaks are observed. rsps are one of the most expressed proteins, and rsp fractions are easily collected by cell-grinding and ultracentrifugation. the discriminatory power of the rsp typing appears to be comparable with the conventional β-tubulin gene analysis. this method would therefore be suitable for species identification and discrimination at strain to species level. because rsp typing can characterize the strains within section fumigati, this method is potentially a powerful and reliable tool in the field of clinical microbiology.
