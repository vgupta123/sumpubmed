BACKGROUND
plants have evolved a spectrum of molecular programs to adapt to environmental stresses. to survive, plants undergo dramatic changes in physiological and molecular mechanisms  <cit> . for instance, heat shock proteins  are stimulated in response to a wide array of stress conditions and perform a fundamental role in protecting plants against abiotic stresses  <cit> .

hsps can be classified into five major categories based on molecular mass: small heat shock protein  family, chaperonin  family, 70-kda heat shock protein  family, hsp <dig> family and hsp100/clpb family  <cit> . in arabidopsis, at least  <dig> genes encoding shsps,  <dig> chaperonins,  <dig> genes encoding hsp70s, seven hsp90s, and four hsp100/clpbs have been identified through genome-wide analysis . rice is the most important staple food crop in the world and the principal model for other monocotyledonous species  <cit> . in recent years, researchers have made great efforts on the functional analysis of individual hsp family members in rice , however hsps still have not been fully characterized and little is known about their interactors  <cit> .

furthermore, detailed studies have established that the overexpression of hsp <dig> genes enhanced the plant’s tolerance to environmental stresses . transgenic rice lines that overexpress shsp <dig>  exhibit increased drought tolerance during the seedling stage  <cit> . however, the cellular mechanisms underlying hsp function under abiotic stress are not fully understood  <cit> . the completion of the rice genome sequencing project and high-throughput experimental methods have generated valuable data that can be used to identify proteins that interact with hsps in rice, and consequently decipher the functions of hsps.

many computational approaches have been proposed to predict protein-protein interactions. in terms of test dataset types, these approaches can be grouped into three classes: sequence-oriented methods , gene expression profile-based methods  <cit>  and structure-oriented methods  <cit> . interolog, a sequence-oriented method, has been widely used to construct protein-protein interactions  in diverse organisms . this method is based on the principle that orthologous pairs can be detected by mapping those known interactions in the source organism onto the target organism  <cit> . the gene expression profile-based methods identify genes that exhibit correlated changes in expression over conditions, since they tend to have similar functions or be involved in cellular processes  <cit> . each protein interaction mapping technique has different advantages and disadvantages  <cit> , and the techniques are complementary to some extent. in this study, we integrated interolog- and gene expression profile-based methods to identify the interactors of hsps in rice.

to carry out more reliable functional analysis, we first conducted a genome-wide screening for the true hsps in rice using integration of orthology and expression association data. then, we used interolog- and expression profile-based methods to identify hsp70s interactors in rice response to abiotic stresses. through mining the signal behind their interactors, we further investigated the pattern of binding sites and the interaction network of hsp70s in response to abiotic stresses.

RESULTS
gene expression in rice subjected to abiotic stresses
four sets of gene expression data from rice seedlings exposed to drought, salt, cold and heat treatment were collected  from the gene expression omnibus   <cit> . the k-nearest neighbor  impute method was used to estimate the missing values in genechips  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  probe-sets with detectable expression values were selected from these genechips. within-slide normalization  and multiple-slide normalization  were performed sequentially to minimize systematic variations.figure  <dig>

then, we identified heat-responsive  probe-sets and estimated the global gene-gene pairwise relationships. in this study, we applied boxplots  <cit>  to identify hr probe-sets, which were defined as a group of probe-sets that were significantly up- or down-regulated by heat treatments. a total of  <dig>   hr probe-sets that were expressed differentially under heat stress were detected . among them,  <dig> probe-sets were up-regulated, while  <dig> probe-sets were down-regulated. meanwhile, bootstrap analysis  <cit>  was performed to estimate the absolute median value of pearson correlation coefficients  between any pair of genes. the bootstrapped 95% confidence interval for the population ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  .figure  <dig>

bootstrap distribution of the estimated median absolute pcc value between the expression value of any two probe-sets in the genechips. ten thousand non-redundant probe pairs were randomly selected, and the absolute pcc value between each pair was computed. based on these  <dig>  pcc values,  <dig>  bootstrap samples were built by sampling with replacement, and the 95% confidence interval of the global median absolute pcc value was determined as ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> .



genome-wide identification of hsps in rice
hsps screening in the rice proteome consisted of three steps. first,  <dig> candidate protein sequences, which were annotated as hsps and contained the characteristic domains  of hsps in uniprot database  <cit> , were downloaded. these sequences included  <dig> small hsps , eight hsp70s, four hsp60s, three hsp90s and three hsp100/clpbs. second,  <dig> of the  <dig> candidate proteins, whose expression value was absent in gse <dig>  or gse <dig> , were filtered out. third, since hsps can stimulate a wide range of hr genes  <cit> , and those genes involved in similar functions or cellular processes are likely to have similar expression profiles over conditions  <cit> . so we supposed the true hsp genes should have a higher expression correlation with hr probe-sets compared with other genes. therefore,  <dig> candidate genes, whose expression patterns were similar to that of the hr probe-sets , were ultimately recognized as hsps, including  <dig> shsps, six hsp70s, three hsp60s, three hsp90s and three hsp100/clpbs . the average absolute value of the pcc between them and hr probe-sets reached  <dig> , which was markedly greater than that of the global pairwise values  and the value of the ubq5/control .table  <dig>

first step: proteins that were annotated as heat shock proteins and contained the specific domains of heat shock proteins were downloaded from uniprot database; second step: hsp candidates, whose expression value was absent in gse <dig> or gse <dig>  were filtered out; third step: candidates, whose expression patterns were strongly correlated with the patterns of the hr probe-sets, were ultimately recognized as heat shock proteins.



genome-wide identification of the interactors of hsps in rice, with a focus on hsp70s
using the interolog method,  <dig>  potential ppis related to hsps in rice  were mapped from the experimentally identified ppi in yeast  <cit> . the predicted ppis corresponding to  <dig> hsp70s accounted for nearly 45% of the total interactions . therefore, in this paper, hsp70s were selected as a case study.

each of  <dig> hsp70s sequences was used as a query to search its interactors in rice based on interlog method. after that, we applied an expression profile-based method to reduce the false-positive rate of hsp70s ppis predicted by interolog. the expression relationship between each interacting partner was further measured by pearson correlation coefficients . we found that the absolute pcc of  <dig>  ppis related to hsp70s, including  <dig> interactors, were greater than  <dig>  . upon exposure to abiotic stresses, the expression of  <dig> interactors showed a positive relationship with that of hsp70s, while the expression of  <dig> interactors was negatively correlated with that of hsp70s .table  <dig>

assessment of the ppis of hsp70s in rice
two computational methods were used to evaluate the overall quality of the above prediction. randomized ppis were generated and used as a control.

first, the co-localization method was applied to assess the hsp <dig> ppis. this method is based on the principle that interacting proteins are more likely to localize to the same cellular compartment than randomized pairs  <cit> . the subcellular localization annotation of each protein in rice was obtained from wolf psort  <cit> , a stringent protein localization predictor based on experimental data. all of the predicted hsp70s interactors contained subcellular localization annotations . we found that  <dig> ppis  localized in common cellular compartments. in contrast, the maximum number of ppis localized in the same subcellular compartment in  <dig>  randomly repeated networks was  <dig>  , which was significantly lower than that of the predicted hsp <dig> ppis .figure  <dig> 
number of predicted interaction pairs localized in the same subcellular organelle. black dots showed the number of pairs localized to a common cellular compartment in the predicted ppis. boxplot and scatter plots represented the distribution of the number in  <dig>  randomly repeated ppis.



second, we used the co-function method to test the overall quality of predicted hsp70s ppis. this method is based on the assumption that interacting partners tend to participate in the same cellular processes or share similar functions  <cit> . the  <dig> hsp70s contained four different go terms  in biological processes  or molecular functions . the result showed that  <dig> of  <dig> predicted hsp <dig> interactors had go annotations , and  <dig> of these interactors  shared at least one common go term with hsp70s. the proportion of predicted interactors sharing the term go: <dig>  go: <dig>  go: <dig> and go: <dig> were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, significantly higher than that of  <dig>  repeats of randomized hsp <dig> interactors  .figure  <dig> 
percentage of interactors that had the same go annotation as hsp70s. black dots represented the percentage of predicted interactors that shared the same go annotations as hsp70s. the boxplot showed the distribution of that in  <dig>  randomized repeats of hsp70s interactors.



identification of the binding sites of hsp70s in rice
the above assessments provided strong support for the reliability of the hsp <dig> interactors predicted in this paper. therefore, we used these interactors as the positive dataset, and constructed a negative dataset composed of  <dig>  proteins that were less likely to interact with hsp70s. since binding sites tend to occur more frequently in interacting proteins than in non-interacting proteins  <cit> , we sought to detect over-represented domains or motifs by comparing their frequency of occurrence in the two different datasets.

the annotations of rice protein domains were obtained from pfam  <cit> . we identified  <dig> domains of  <dig> proteins in the positive dataset , and  <dig>  domains of  <dig>  proteins in the negative dataset. the number of negative samples was much greater than that of positive samples . to reduce this bias, we implemented one-tailed fisher’s exact test  <cit>  to detect the over-represented domains in the coordinated datasets , and used the benjamini and hochberg  method  <cit>  to control the false discovery rate . in addition, the above procedure was repeated  <dig> times by randomly changing the negative samples. finally,  <dig> domains were detected with p-value lower than  <dig>  in the  <dig> replicas . similarly, we analyzed the binding motifs of hsp70s in rice. the motif annotations were acquired from prosite  <cit> . there were  <dig> motifs in  <dig> proteins among the positive samples , while there were  <dig>  motifs in  <dig>  proteins among the negative samples. twenty-eight overrepresented motifs were ultimately investigated .

functional analysis of hsp70s in rice
it is expected that the functions of proteins can be deduced from their interactors. as mentioned above, among the  <dig> interactors of hsp70s,  <dig> have bp or mf go annotations . furthermore,  <dig> interactors, whose expression levels positively correlated with that of hsp70s, contained  <dig> go annotations. in contrast, the  <dig> interactors, whose expression levels negatively correlated with hsp70s, had  <dig> different go annotations. the two distinct groups were defined as positively correlated interactors  and negatively correlated interactors . using go enrichment analysis, we found that  <dig> bp go terms and five mf go terms with p-values less than  <dig> , were enriched in the pcis compared with that in ncis , suggesting that these biological processes or functions would be induced with the up-regulation of hsp70s. meanwhile,  <dig> bp go terms and  <dig> mf go terms with p-values less than  <dig>  were over-represented in the ncis compared with that in the pcis , indicating that these biological processes or functions would be induced as hsp70s down-regulation.

construction of tools and ricehsp database
we constructed two databases, named rice heat shock proteins  and rice gene expression profile , and one online tool, named protein-protein interaction predictor . the ricehsps was built to store and show our predicted results in this paper. the rgep was constructed to store the integrated gene expression data for rice subjected to abiotic stresses, including drought, salt, cold and high temperature. it also provided a function for identifier conversion among michigan state university osa <dig> rice locus , rice annotation project locus  and affymetrix rice genome probe-set  . the tool ppip was developed based on the interolog method. once the user uploads at least two protein sequences in fasta format into the text area, or a sequence file less than 2 mb, the corresponding orthologous protein pairs, whose interaction has been verified by biochemical experiments in the selected model organism, will be retrieved . these online databases and tool can be accessible at http://bioinformatics.fafu.edu.cn.figure  <dig>

discussion
heat shock proteins  in rice
using a combination of orthology and expression association data, we identified  <dig> heat shock proteins, including  <dig> shsps,  <dig> hsp70s,  <dig> hsp60s,  <dig> hsp90s and  <dig> hsp100/clpbs. using an orthology-based strategy, sarkar et al.  identified  <dig> shsps in rice  <cit> ,  <dig> of which were confirmed in this paper and showed a strong relationship with hr probe-sets under abiotic stresses. according to orthology- and expression level-based data, singh et al.  discovered three hsp100/clpb proteins in rice  <cit> , which were consistent with the result of this paper. we further noted that the expression pattern of the three hsp100/clpbs closely resembled that of hr probe-sets under abiotic stresses. recently, sarkar et al.  identified  <dig> hsp <dig> genes through sequence analysis and orthology-based method  <cit> , including all the six hsp70s in this paper. however, in this study, we not only adopted the sequence and orthology information, but also the gene expression association information to identify true hsps in rice. given that similar proteins in different species may have different functions, one has to take into account that an orthology-based strategy alone is not adequate to identify true hsps in rice. furthermore, it is not reliable to screen hsps for evaluating the gene expression levels of candidates in rice in response to high-temperature stress, because some hsps express constitutively  <cit> . therefore, we used a combination of orthology and expression association data to identify a highly reliable hsps in rice.

binding sites of hsp70s in rice
investigating the binding sites of hsp70s will provide insight into the activity of those proteins and improve our ability to predict the potential risks of a particular mutation. in this study, we identified  <dig> domains and  <dig> motifs that occurred more frequently in the positive dataset than in the negative dataset, suggesting that these sequences are potential target sites for hsp70s in rice. the results were partially supported by biochemical experiments conducted in previous studies. for instance, our results showed that the j-domain  of dnaj/hsp <dig> was the binding site for dnak/hsp <dig>  by point mutation analysis, wall et al.  demonstrated that the j-domain interacted with dnak and regulated dnak activity  <cit> . suh et al.  found that the atpase domain of dnak was a binding pocket for the j-domain  <cit> . horne et al.  suggested that the fusion of the j-domain with p <dig>  could dramatically stimulate atp hydrolysis by dnak, and nmr studies on jdp <dig> further indicated that the peptide tethered the j-domain to the atpase domain of dnak  <cit> .

therefore, the results of this study provided useful clues for experimental biologists in further analyzing the function of hsp70s.

the hsp <dig> interaction network in rice
the hsp70s network was shown in figure  <dig>  and described in the following sections. we classified the interaction network into five sub-networks.figure  <dig> 
ppi network of hsp70s in rice.  sub-network a: macromolecule localization.  sub-network b: carbohydrate metabolism.  sub-network c: innate immunity. eti, effector - triggered immunity process; pti, pamp-triggered immunity process.  sub-network d: photosystem ii repair.  sub-network e: protein kinase activities. red curves indicated known and published interactions, whereas blue curves indicated potential interactions detected in this paper.



sub-network a: macromolecular translocation
our results showed that the small gtpase ran , importin α  and importin β  could bind to hsp70s. hsp <dig> and importin β were previously identified as ran-interacting proteins   <cit> . the results of this study indicated that the ras family domain  and atp/gtp-binding site motif a   of the small gtpase ran were potential interacting sites of hsp70s. furthermore, the expression of ran and importin proteins was strongly correlated with that of hsp70s  under abiotic stresses . we then constructed a protein-protein interaction network consisting of hsp70s, gtpase ran and importin proteins in rice .

importin α recognizes the nuclear localization signal  of nuclear proteins in the cytoplasm, forming a stable complex termed the nuclear pore-targeting complex   <cit> . importin β docks the ptac to the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex   <cit> , a channel for macromolecules into the nucleus  <cit> . in addition, the hydrolysis of gtp by the small gtpase ran has been shown to be essential for the translocation of docked patc into the nucleus  <cit> . therefore, the interaction network between hsp70s, gtpase ran and importin proteins in rice might be involved in translocation of macromolecules. shulga et al.  stated that hsp <dig> could act as a molecular chaperone to promote the formation and stability of the nuclear localization signal-containing complex during both targeting and translocation phases of nuclear transport  <cit> .

sub-network b: plant carbohydrate metabolism
the results of this study revealed that hsp70s interacted with enolase , fumaratehydratase , malate dehydrogenase  and citrate synthase , which were constructed in sub-network b . most of these potential interactions have been partly validated by previous studies. in vitro studies indicated that hsp <dig> might assist in transporting fumaratehydratase between the cytosol and mitochondria  <cit> . furthermore, it has been reported that the hsp <dig> complex significantly increased the spontaneous rate of refolding of denatured mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase  <cit> . hsp70s have also been demonstrated to reduce the aggregation of citrate synthase under heat stress  <cit> . recently, through co-immunoprecipitation  assays, luo et al.  further confirmed that hsp <dig> could directly interact with α-enolase  <cit> .

our results indicated that the expression levels of hsp70s were positively and strongly correlated with that of enolase, fumaratehydratase, malate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase in response to abiotic stresses , implying that hsp70s might have essential functions in stimulating carbohydrate metabolism by regulating the activity of those key enzymes. in a metabolomics study, kaplan et al.  also found that carbohydrate metabolism was affected by heat shock in arabidopsis <cit> . the amount of pyruvate and oxaloacetate increased coordinately upon heat shock, while the fumarate and malate  contents were similarly elevated, suggesting that the embden-meyerhof-parnas  pathway and tricarboxylic acid cycle  cycle would be enhanced by abiotic stresses.

sub-network c: plant innate immunity
in this study, we found that hsp70s might cooperate with members of the small gtpaserac family , hsp <dig> , skp <dig>  and mapk <dig> , as shown in figure 9c. hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and rar <dig> have been documented as the components of rac <dig> complex in rice, based on coip experiments  <cit> . moreover, multiple lines of evidence have shown that hsp <dig> was a negative regulator of ask1/map3k, and overexpression of hsp <dig> inhibited the mapk signaling cascade, which was associated with apoptosis . consistent with previous studies, our results further illustrated that the expression level of hsp70s was positively correlated with that of rac, hsp <dig> and skp <dig>  and negatively correlated with that of mapk <dig> in response to abiotic stresses . furthermore, in addition to rac , mapk <dig>  also contained potential binding sites for hsp70s.

previous reports have shown that hsp <dig> and two co-chaperone-like molecules, rar <dig> and sgt <dig>  performed a key role in effector-triggered immunity , the second line of the plant defense system  <cit> . additionally, in vitro studies have indicated that sgt <dig> can interact with skp <dig> and link it to the hsp <dig> co-chaperone complexes  <cit> . further research found that the skp1-cullin1-f-box  complex regulated the stability of resistance  proteins  <cit> , suggesting that skp <dig> might also be involved in the eti response. in addition, the small gtpase rac could function as a critical switch downstream of two types of innate immunity: pamp-triggered immunity  and effector-triggered immunity   <cit> . this finding was recently supported by jung et al. . they found that the oscthsp70- <dig> had a functional association with ras/raf-mediated mapk kinase cascades  <cit> .

sub-network d: photosystem ii repair
sub-network d showed that hsp70s might interact with ftsh families  . indeed, this interaction has been previously confirmed by shen and colleagues  <cit> . in this study, we found that there was a close positive correlation  between the expression of hsp70s and ftsh families in rice subjected to abiotic stresses . the aaa-protein family signatures  of ftsh proteins were identified as potential target sites for hsp70s. previous showed that ftsh family members played an important role in the d <dig> repair cycle of psii . using native gel electrophoresis, yokthongwattana et al.  revealed that hsp70s could form a complex with intact d <dig> protein and also with d <dig> and cp <dig>  <cit> , suggesting hsp70s have a function in the photosystem ii  repair cycle.

sub-network e: protein kinase activities
in this study, we found that nearly 46% of the hsp <dig> interactors  contained protein kinase domains, including protein kinase c , protein kinase a , apoptosis signal-regulating kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinasekinase , mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase , mitogen-activated protein kinase , cyclin-dependent kinase , ca2+-dependent protein kinase , cbl-interacting protein kinase , osmotic stress/abscisic acid-activated protein kinase  and wall-associated kinase  family members. furthermore, our results showed that the expression level of approximately 81% of those protein kinases  had a strong negative correlation  with that of hsp70s. this was consistent with previous studies. hsp70s were reported to directly interact with pkc, ask/map3k and cdk  <cit> , and inhibit the activities of jun amino-terminal kinase , ask/map3k, mapk and cdk . ding et al.  have shown that overexpression of hsp <dig> significantly suppressed the enzymatic activities of pka and pkc  <cit> . therefore, it is likely that hsp70s indiscriminately down-regulate the activity of various protein kinases.

CONCLUSIONS
by integrating orthology and functional association data, we identified  <dig> hsps in rice, including  <dig> shsps,  <dig> hsp70s,  <dig> hsp60s,  <dig> hsp90s and  <dig> hsp100/clpbs. then, using hsp70s as a case study, we identified  <dig> interactors of hsp70s in rice by combining interolog- and expression profile-based methods. according to the interactors of hsp70s, we investigated the potential binding sites of hsp70s, and analyzed the interacting network of hsp70s in rice. finally, we constructed two online databases and one tool, which could be accessed at http://bioinformatics.fafu.edu.cn/.
