BACKGROUND
vast amounts of three-dimensional  protein data from structural genomic studies and other individual efforts have been added to our knowledge, thereby enhancing our understanding of protein structures. to date, only two extremes of protein structural data have been studied. one extreme includes local features of proteins: those of short protein segments, typically of  <dig> residues long or less. the other extreme includes global features of proteins: protein folds or structural domains.

regarding the short protein segments, abundant research examples exist partly because of the existence of variations of methods to analyze the local features of proteins. various measures, such as rmsds after structural superposition  <cit> , cα-cα atomic distances coupled with the torsion angles  <cit> , dihedral angles  <cit> , and so on have been used to define the conformational similarity of protein segments. different clustering techniques, such as k-means clustering  <cit> , hierarchical methods  <cit> , competitive learning  <cit> , and other methods  <cit> , have been used to describe the organization of the segments' conformational space. the abundance of research results in this area is also partly attributable to various applications of the clustering results of the short segments. a set of representatives from the resulting clusters are often called structural building blocks . even when using different procedures, clustering resolutions of sbbs can be categorized into only a few levels depending mainly on their respective applications, such as structural modeling, verification, comparison, and prediction  <cit> . the most dominant cluster of the short segments, which is common in all studies, corresponds to α-helices, whereas the variability of β-strands is observed at the high-resolution clustering. regarding global features of proteins, understanding of their organization and analysis of the protein-fold  space studies are progressing well.

as reviewed recently  <cit> , both hierarchical and continuous aspects of fold space have been realized. regarding hierarchical classification, widely used databases such as cath  <cit>  and scop  <cit>  have been constructed. other databases such as fssp  <cit>  and vast  <cit>  have been developed. they are based on continuous measurements of protein structural similarity. several studies have provided insights into the nature of fold space. holm and sander first described the conformational distribution of protein folds in a fold universe with multi-dimensional scaling methods based on an all-on-all comparison using the dali program  <cit> . using the same measurement, hou et al.  <cit>  showed visual representations of the protein fold universe and identified three major components which characterize the fold space: secondary structure compositions, chain topologies, and the protein domain size.

compared to these two extremes, limited surveys have been done on the conformational space of medium size segments between protein short segments and folds. specifically, supersecondary structures such as α-hairpin, βαβ-unit, and β-hairpin are typical structural motifs of medium size; those motifs have been analyzed. for example, salem et al. reported that most superfolds contain a higher proportion of their α-helical or β-strand residues in one such supersecondary structure  <cit> . szustakowski et al. built a dictionary of supersecondary structures  <cit> . kurgan and kedarisetti studied regularity among twilight zone protein structures at the level of the sequence segments that correspond to the secondary structure fragments of varying length  <cit> . however, the organization and statistical properties of the whole conformational space of medium-to-long segments remain unclear. statistical and systematic analyses should be done on the 'segment universe' from short to long lengths to bridge this gap.

our previous study identified structural clusters and visualized the uneven distribution of short segments in the conformational spaces of 6– <dig> residues, where known and novel secondary-structure motifs are distributed as isolated clusters  <cit> . the general features of the segment distribution were consistent for these lengths. however, the question we sought to answer is: do spaces of long segments differ from those of short segments? in this study, we explore the relationships between the conformational distribution of segments and their length: 10– <dig> residues, thereby providing a global view of a 'segment universe' and showing critical dual changes  of the distribution shape in the conformational space of short to long segments. the critical changes might reflect changes of the protein structures' organization. therefore, the present results suggest the adequacy and the possibility of further progress of the hierarchical treatment used in the recent de novo structure prediction methods. furthermore, by comparing conformational components among structural classes , we demonstrate the specificity and generality of protein fold classes.

RESULTS
transitions of segment distribution: short, medium, and long segments
the coverage of segments in cluster was calculated as described below. a densely populated region in the 3d principal component analysis  space was defined as a cluster  <cit> . given a density threshold, the segments are classifiable into two groups: those in regions of a density larger than the threshold and those outside the regions. the coverage of segments in clusters is defined as a ratio of the segments in the regions to all the segments.

further analyses of the coverage graphs between the short and long segments were meaningful to discover the boundaries of distribution changes. figure 1b shows coverage curves for lengths of 21– <dig> residues. the dual and critical transitions, with an intermediate phase for segment lengths of 23– <dig> residues, can be recognized clearly, as presented in fig. 1b. the transitions at intermediate length are also characterized by the distributional alteration of the radius of gyration of segments in the populated region with density of  <dig> – <dig>  . to adjust the effect of different segment lengths, we defined here the relative score  of the radius of gyration for a segment as  - min rg)/ - min rg), where rg denotes the radius of gyration of a segment i with length j, and where max rg and min rg represent the maximal and minimal radius of gyration of the entire segment dataset with length j. based on these observations, the segment length is categorized into the following three groups: short , medium , and long . we were able to show that changes in the density gradient are associated with distributional alterations in the segment universe in subsequent analyses of visualizing the 3d pca space. in fact, the difference in the coverage between lengths of  <dig> and  <dig> residues was attributable to the increase in the volume for the most populated region, as discussed below. the typical global images of segment universes from the three categories are depicted in fig. 3d. the segment universes here were generated by the first three principal components derived from the entire segment dataset: pcall <dig>  pcall <dig>  and pcall <dig> .

short length 
the conformational space of short segments showed a distribution with an extreme density gradient that originated from secondary structure clusters: α-helix and β-strand clusters were discriminated using a density of  <dig>  . between the lengths of  <dig> and  <dig> residues, spatial arrangements of the segment distribution, especially for α-helical, β-strand, and β-hairpin clusters, were conserved in short conformational spaces. the highly populated core of the α-helix cluster exhibited a density of  <dig>  , consisting of completed α-helical segments. the surrounding area of the central region consisted of various types of helical conformations including helix-capping motifs  <cit> . the central region of the β-strand cluster consisted of fully extended segments that originated mainly from β-sheets and loop regions. the β-hairpin conformations were separated into several clusters at a density of  <dig> . then they were discriminated using the coordinate c <dig> along pcall <dig> . the β-hairpin clusters showed a symmetrical relationship related to the n-terminal and c-terminal halves. they were arranged symmetrically around an edge of segment universes of short length.

medium length 
the segment distribution for medium lengths differed from that for short lengths. the distributional change from short to medium lengths is characterized using a diminishing β-strand cluster and a growing α-helix cluster. the overall distribution was shortened in the direction of pcall <dig>  and enlarged in the direction of pcall <dig> and pcall <dig>  in the segment universe of  <dig> residues, the α-helix cluster was discriminated using a density of  <dig>  . interestingly, the shape of the α-helix cluster was a ring . the helix ring cluster that is specific to the medium-length universe consisted not only of the extended α-helices but also of various α-helical conformations, as presented in the inset of fig. 3b. this cluster included conformations that had originated mainly from all-α, α/β, and α +β proteins . the average content of the α-helical residues per segment in the helix ring cluster was about 50% ;  <dig> % of all segments were included within the helix ring cluster. the long-α-helical segments, whose conformation was not compact, were located near the origin of the conformational space . in contrast, the α-hairpin conformations with a small radius of gyration were located on the opposite side of the position on pcall <dig>  the various α-hairpin conformations with the different turn positions were located symmetrically along pcall <dig>  for medium lengths, the β-strand clusters were diminished because long extended β-strands are rarely found in proteins. the β-hairpin conformations were located symmetrically along pcall <dig>  although the cluster separation of β-hairpins was not clear in medium lengths.

long length 
conformational spaces for the long lengths were further shortened in the direction of pcall <dig> and enlarged in that of pcall <dig>  the segment distribution converged on a large populated region that exhibited a density of  <dig>   in the conformational space. with a length of  <dig> residues, there were two clusters consisting of compact segments and long α-helical segments, respectively, with densities of  <dig>   in the populated region. the emergence of the compact-segment cluster was attributable to an increase in various types of segments with a small radius of gyration . various types of conformations are mixed up in the compact-segment cluster. the α-hairpins are derived mainly from all-α proteins. the compact β-sheet structures are derived mainly from all-β proteins. compact conformations of other types are derived from α/β and α +β proteins . about 2% of all segments were included in the compact-segment cluster for 27-residue length. in contrast, long α-helical segments with a large radius of gyration were located on the opposite side of the cluster of the compact segments along the pcall <dig> axis. for lengths greater than  <dig> residues, the proportion of the conformations with a small radius of gyration in the compact-segment cluster increased rapidly to around 14% for 50-residue lengths. those conformations were derived from various folds . the supersecondary structures, such as βαβ units and β-sheets, were included in the compact-segment cluster .

contribution ratios of principal axes
distributional alterations were observed associated with the changes of segment length. for principal component analyses, the contribution ratios  of the principal components  to the entire distribution indicate how well the pc axes can cover the variation in the original data. figure  <dig> portrays contribution ratios of the first five pc axes  for segment lengths of 10– <dig> residues. even with a length of  <dig> residues, the cumulative contribution ratio of the first three pc axes, q <dig> , was greater than 60%, although q <dig> decreased constantly with increased segment length. each of q <dig> and q <dig> was always less than 8%. the contribution ratios for higher-order pc axes than pcall <dig> did not exceed 5% for the examined segment lengths. therefore, it is sufficient to use only the first three pc axes  to explain the original structural variation.

with respect to the individual contribution ratios  of the first three pc axes, q <dig> was overwhelmingly higher than those of the other pc axes up to 50-residue length , which indicates that pcall <dig> is a meaningful and fundamental descriptor for segment conformation. actually, q <dig> decreased rapidly, and q <dig> increased in the short segment lengths . thereafter, both q <dig> and q <dig> decreased slowly. in addition, q <dig> increased gradually with lengths up to  <dig> residues, with a maximum value of  <dig> %.

investigation of structural properties of conformational axes
an eigenvector was analyzed for each pc axis with a triangle map to elucidate the physical and conformational meaning of the pc axes of the conformational space of the short to long segments. the eigenvector can be regarded as a collective variable to describe the segment conformation. figure  <dig> shows triangle maps of the first five pc axes  for short , medium , and long segments . the triangle map clearly portrays residue pairs, with large or small deviations of cα-cα distances along each pc axis from the average distance <qi>. in the triangle map, positive  and negative  areas correspond to residue pairs with mutually inverse deviations. the patterns of red and blue areas are conserved in the universes of short to long segments, indicating that conformational deviations related to the pc axes are conserved among the universes. figure  <dig> depicts the conformational changes along the pc axis using colored arrows.

actually, pcall <dig> corresponds to the change of the radius of gyration . the triangle map for pcall <dig> has only one positive area, shown as red in fig.  <dig>  which is located near the residue pairs at the n-terminal and c-terminal sides. this single area indicates that the distant residue pairs in the sequence have a larger conformational deviation along pcall <dig>  the correlation coefficient of the conformational deviation along pcall <dig> with rg was greater than  <dig>  in segment lengths of 10– <dig> residues . the arrows in fig.  <dig> point to the center of the segment, which indicates clearly that the conformational changes along pcall <dig> are involved with expansions or compressions of the conformation. for short lengths, pcall <dig> also shows a strong correlation with the changes of the segment end-to-end distance , which is defined as the cα-cα distance between the first and last residues of segments. correlation between pcall <dig> and dend slowly weakened with increased segment length:  <dig>  for  <dig> residues,  <dig>  for  <dig> residues, and  <dig>  for  <dig> residues.

the pcall <dig> correlates to a degree of structural symmetry  of a segment with respect to the n-terminal and c-terminal halves. the dsym is defined as follows: given a distance matrix for a segment, where element  is the distance  between cα atoms of residue i and j. then, the degree of structural symmetry is defined as the sum of the squared differences of symmetric elements in a distance matrix for a segment: dsym = Σ <dig> ≤ i < j ≤ n n-) <dig>  where n is the segment length. the triangle map for pcall <dig> was separated into one positive area  and one negative area . the correlation coefficient of the conformational deviation along pcall <dig> with structural symmetry, dsym was greater than  <dig>  in the segment lengths of 10– <dig> residues . both conformations displayed mirrored symmetry about a plane constructed by pcall <dig> and pcall <dig> when two conformations were picked from opposite positions along pcall <dig>  the segment conformations picked up along pcall <dig> are shown in figs. 3a–3c.

the pcall <dig> correlated with a physical indicator that describes a conformational transition between structures with one turn and ones with two turns . the picked conformations along pcall <dig> indicate that segregation of a β-hairpin structure exists along with conformational changes by pcall <dig>  we defined the physical indicator  of the β-hairpin formation: dmn+mc is the sum of the norms of two vectors, which were generated by the middle point of the segment for both the n-terminal and c-terminal residues: dmn+mc = |dmn→+dmc→|, where dmn→ and dmc→ respectively denote the vectors from the midpoint to the n-terminal and c-terminal residues of the segment. good correlation was found between pcall <dig> and dmn+mc . the correlation coefficient was greater than  <dig>  for the 10– <dig> residues. the triangle map of pcall <dig> indicated a separation of one positive area  and two negative areas . it is noteworthy that the triangle map of pcall <dig> for short segments differed slightly from those of medium and long segments. a positive area is visible near the residue pair of the n-terminal and c-terminal in the short map, suggesting that pcall <dig> has a  correlation with dend. for medium and long lengths, the positive area was close to the center of the triangle map. therefore, the correlation between pcall <dig> and dmn+mc/dend was necessarily smaller in medium and long lengths.

the triangle map of pcall <dig> had one negative area and one positive area. the positive area, located at the map center, suggests that pcall <dig> is correlated with the radius of gyration  of the middle region of the segment – except for both the n-terminal and c-terminal quarter portions – in the medium and long segments. the respective correlation coefficients for the  <dig> and  <dig> residue lengths were  <dig>  and  <dig> . the pcall <dig> also has a weak  correlation with dend. the respective correlation coefficients between pcall <dig> and dend for the  <dig> and  <dig> residue lengths were - <dig>  and - <dig> .

we identified no simple physical indicator for conformational changes along pcall <dig>  however, visual inspection from conformations picked along pcall <dig> suggests that pcall <dig> is a conformational axis that represents segregated β-sheet structures. conformations picked up from both ends on pcall <dig> are depicted in fig.  <dig>  in the triangle map for pcall <dig>  two positive and two negative areas exist along the diagonal line, which might indicate that pcall <dig> segregates segment conformations with double turns. the pcβ <dig> contribution ratio, which was derived from all-β proteins, was higher than that derived from other structural classes, which suggests that pc <dig> is important for describing the structural variation of β-structures.

segment universes derived from different structural classes
the segment universes described above are those derived from proteins of the four structural classes. therefore, decomposition of the universe into four classes is helpful to evaluate the influence of each structural class on the segment universe. to this end, a segment universe was constructed for each structural class separately, and compared the pc axes derived from each universe with those of all segments . the first three largest eigenvectors of each structural class were also compared respectively with pcall <dig>  pcall <dig>  and pcall <dig> to elucidate the structural properties of pc axes derived from each universe.

however, the curves for the contribution ratios of both all-α and all-β classes  differ clearly from those of pcall <dig> – pcall <dig> . the qα <dig>  contribution ratio was always higher than 40%, which indicates that the distribution of the all-α segments has a large deviation with respect to rg. in contrast, the qβ <dig> contribution ratio decreased rapidly with increasing segment length. the value of qα <dig> increased moderately with increasing segment length. in contrast, the qβ <dig> had a maximum value greater than 20% at a length of  <dig> residues. this rapid increase of qβ <dig> might reflect a typical feature for β-sheet conformations. for pc <dig>  the curves for the contribution ratios of the all-α and all-β classes also mutually differed. although qβ <dig> peaked at a length of  <dig> residues, qα <dig> peaked with a short length, which indicates that the structural variable based on pcall <dig> is important for β-segments longer than  <dig> residues. in contrast, the behaviors of the contribution ratios for both α+β and α/β classes along with the segment length resembled each other. they were also similar to q1-q <dig> in fig.  <dig> because those structural classes are mixtures of α-helices and β-sheets.

subsequently, pc axes that were specific for each structural class were examined. for this analysis, the pc axis was defined as a "class-specific" one when a pc axis from a structural class showed no similarity with the first  <dig> pc axes from the other three structural classes . the first  <dig> pc axes of each class were investigated for the short , medium , and long  segments. ten class-specific conformational axes were identified and consisted of one  for the short length, eight for the medium, and one  for the long. the eight class-specific axes for the medium-length segments are pcα <dig>  pcα <dig>  and pcα <dig> for all-α, pcβ <dig> for all-β, pcα+β <dig> and pcα+β <dig> for α+β, and pcα/β <dig> and pcα/β <dig> for α/β. four examples out of eight are depicted in fig.  <dig>  a clear correlation of these pc axes is difficult to discern according to simple physical or structural quantities. figure 10a shows that the pcα <dig> describes a structural change of three  parts of α-segments. the pcα/β <dig> is related to βαβ motifs, which is the most fundamental structural unit for α/β proteins.

discussion
investigation of the protein segment universe is an important subject for bioinformatics. results of this study show that the segment universe can be categorized naturally into three regimes: short, medium, and long. a main finding of this study is that the three regimes are clearly demarcated by critical changes in the shape of the segment distribution in the conformational space. preceding studies demonstrated that the average length of α-helix is  <dig> residues  <cit>  and that for β-strand is five residues  <cit> . results of the present study show that transitional segment lengths  do not coincide with these average lengths. therefore, a single secondary structure element does not characterize the shape of the segment distribution. the appearance of the medium length regime segregates the segment fold universe into three. the combination of secondary-structure elements is important to characterize not only the medium-length segment universe but also the entire segment fold universe.

meanwhile, loops, which make up 30% of the protein structures  <cit> , are also expected to take a larger role to form some unique conformations by connecting secondary-structure elements in the medium to the long-length segment universe than short one. the segments in the cluster of the medium to long-length universe tend to contain more loop regions than those of the short segment universe, as shown in figs. 4b and 4d, and have a wider variety of origins . for example, the segments in the cluster with density of  <dig> – <dig>  of the universe of  <dig> residues length are derived from  <dig> proteins out of all  <dig> representatives used for this study . longer loops that possess extended conformations are located on the opposite side of the compact-segment cluster along pcall <dig> in the medium to long segment universe . instead of discrete clusters, they appear to constitute a rather continuous distribution. some analyses examine short loops with respect to their completeness  <cit>  and elaborate classification  <cit> . in the analysis of short segments, our method also captured some loop conformation classes, such as joint loops connecting two helices, and exposed and extended loops participated in protein-protein interactions  <cit> .

a natural boundary was identified, in this study, between the peptide-like and protein-like distributions between the lengths of  <dig> and  <dig> residues using actual conformations of protein segments. this observation with respect to the boundary is consistent with the results described by shen et al.  <cit> , even though they used a sphere-packing model to estimate a minimal domain size of about  <dig> residues. a recent study by sawada and honda  <cit>  also identified a boundary at 10– <dig> residue length by calculating the structural diversity of segments. they discretized the conformational space using a single-pass clustering method. in contrast, we observed the density distribution to uncover differences of conformational space between short and long segments. the segment conformational space for lengths of 10– <dig> residues provided a distribution with an extreme density gradient towards the secondary structure, such as the α-helix, β-strand, and β-hairpin clusters, which are expected to belong to the peptide-like conformational regime. this conformational variation reflects that short segments embedded in globular proteins are mainly stabilized by the physicochemical property of the peptide. on the other hand, the segment conformational spaces for lengths of  <dig> residues or more have a distribution that is dominated by compact segments, which suggests a protein-like distribution . this distribution arises from the hydrophobic effect imparted by the solvent molecules, which is of great importance for structural stability in long segments derived from globular proteins. if this is the case, our observations support the de novo structure prediction methods, so-called fragment assembling methods, that have been developed recently  <cit> . these approaches are usually based on the prediction of local segment conformations followed by assembly of segments, and are generally used to separate criteria at each step; sequence similarity or secondary structural propensity for the prediction of segment conformations, and non-local energy terms for the assembling step. these strategies used in the de novo prediction methods seems to be consistent with the results shown here. results of our analyses clearly show such a hierarchical organization of protein structures, and indicate that preparing segment libraries up to around  <dig> residues long would be helpful for such methods.

these results indicate that the structural meanings for the conformational axes  are conserved in the different lengths and structural classes. this fact suggests that these conformational components are key structural variables for protein segments. on the other hand, when conformational axes among the four structural classes were compared, we were able to identify several conformational axes that were specific to each structural class, especially in the medium length range. in fact, a distribution change for medium lengths was observed, involving an increase in compact segments. those segments included supersecondary structures such as α-hairpins, parts of the β-sheets, and βαβ units. these results might be related to the specificity of the structural class or fold of the contents of supersecondary structures  <cit> . typical supersecondary structural motifs, α-hairpin, β-hairpin, and βαβ are, respectively, the basic structural units for the all-α, all-β, and α/β proteins. these motifs are often shared within the structural classes. therefore, the contribution ratios observed for the class-specific conformational axes were high. class-specific conformational axes were rarely observed in short and long lengths, probably because short segments are too nonspecific and are often shared over different structural classes; long segments are too specific and have very low contribution ratios for conformational axes that are specific for each structural class.

the currently found class-specific conformational axes provide a hint to solve a difficulty in classifying diverse sets of protein structures. both α/β and α+β classes are known to show a substantial overlap. in the cath classification, α/β and α+β classes are treated as one structural class as α-β class. classifying α/β and α+β proteins is sometimes a difficult problem, although several classification  <cit>  and also prediction  <cit>  schemes have been proposed. the present study showed that α/β and α+β classes have similar characteristics of universes, and also have unique ones at the same time. for example, our results show that pcα/β <dig>  whose contribution ratio was  <dig> %, was associated only with the βαβ motif. in the α+β class, no axis was strongly correlated with pcα/β <dig> , which is a clear example of the difference in structural variables between α+β and α/β classes originating from class-specific supersecondary structures. consequently, projecting segments onto a conformational subspace using the axis pcα/β <dig> could be useful for objectively dividing protein domains of α-β class into α/β and α+β classes. a considerable localization of segments derived from α/β proteins in a pca subspace is observed .

an effective method must be developed for conformational sampling for de novo prediction methods. the resulting structural variables analyzed in this study would be helpful for additional progress in de novo structure prediction. for example, testing the distribution of segments or models in terms of the degree of symmetry using the descriptor  might be useful to verify the completeness of sampling of the conformational space. using a filtering threshold or function  that is tolerant of the radius of gyration might be useful for improving the prediction of all-α proteins because the contribution ratio, qα <dig>  of pcα  <dig> corresponding to the radius of gyration  is larger than those of the other structural classes in the medium and long segments. consequently, projecting segments of models onto a conformational subspace constructed by pcx  axes might be helpful for filtering out models and assigning a protein to a structural class.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, the dual critical transitions in the protein segment universe from short to long length are shown. our observations are related to the transitions proposed by the significance of two-stage treatment in de novo structure prediction. considering the hierarchical organization of a protein segment universe that we have shown, we suggest the efficacy of using the evaluation functions that is secondary-structure-directed for sampling local structures less than  <dig> residues long. we also suggest the suitability of evaluating protein-like features of models using another function  for longer segments. changing the criteria of filtering for each structural class will enhance the effectiveness of the conformation sampling process. through these analyses, we have demonstrated that our clustering methodology is useful to identify a distinctive distribution shift of conformational space between short and long segments and that distribution changes depend on structural classes.
