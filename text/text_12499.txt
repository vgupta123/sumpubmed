BACKGROUND
human enterovirus  <dig> is a non-enveloped rna virus of the picornaviridae family. the virion is around 30 nm in diameter containing a single-stranded positive-sense rna genome of approximately  <dig> nucleotides  <cit> . the whole genome is translated into a single large polyprotein that can be subsequently processed by protease digestion to produce four capsid subunit proteins, vp <dig> to vp <dig> and other nonstructural proteins. the icosahedral capsid is composed of  <dig> sets structural proteins . it has been shown that vp1- <dig> form a pseudo t =  <dig> icosahedral capsid that are located on the surface of viral capsid  <cit> . vp <dig> is located inside, which is approximately  <dig> amino acids in length and is myristoylated at the n terminus  <cit> . crystallographic analysis showed that the mature ev <dig> virus is structurally similar to other enteroviruses  <cit> .

ev <dig> and coxsackievirus a <dig>  have been identified as the two major etiological agents of hand, foot and mouth disease   <cit> . large outbreaks of hfmd have recently been reported in the asia-pacific region, which is becoming a common acute viral disease in these areas and posing a serious health threat to children  <cit> . while hfmd is usually mild and self-limiting, it may lead to severe neurological complications and even death  <cit> . however, no effective vaccine is yet available to prevent ev <dig> infection.

the evidence that maternal mice vaccinated with the ev <dig> virus-like particles  can confer protection to neonatal mice against lethal challenge reveals an essential role of neutralizing antibody in the protection against infection  <cit> . to determine the immunodominant epitopes of ev <dig> capsid protein, antisera generated from animals immunized with formalin-inactivated ev <dig> vaccine were screened against a set of overlapping synthetic peptides covering the entire sequences of vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig> of ev <dig>  several linear immunodominant neutralization epitopes have been successfully identified in vp <dig> and vp <dig> proteins  <cit> . numerous studies reported that synthetic peptides containing neutralizing epitope of vp <dig> elicited neutralizing antibody response and protected neonatal mice against lethal challenges  <cit> . therefore, the epitope-based vaccine has a great potential to be a successful vaccine to prevent ev <dig> infection.

in the present study, the peptide consisting of n-terminal residues 1– <dig> of ev <dig> vp <dig> of genotype c <dig> was fused to hepatitis b core antigen  and expressed in e. coli. the resulting fusion proteins were able to spontaneously assemble into chimeric vlps, which elicited virus-neutralizing antibody response. we further identified a highly conserved linear neutralizing epitope in the n-terminus of ev <dig> vp <dig> by epitope mapping experiments. our results suggest that chimeric hbcag particles carrying a neutralizing epitope of ev <dig> vp <dig> could be a promising vaccine candidate against ev <dig> infection.

RESULTS
generation of chimeric particles carrying the peptide vp4n20
the gene sequence and amino acid sequence of peptide vp4n <dig> as well as its insertion position in hbcag are shown in figure  <dig>  the plasmid vector pet22b   encodes a six-histidine tag at the c-terminal region of recombinant proteins for convenient purification by affinity chromatography as well as expression analysis by western-blot. a carboxyl-terminally truncated hbcag protein  and a fusion protein  were expressed in e. coli, respectively.

the efficient expression of both proteins was demonstrated by western-blot after iptg induction . they were further purified using ni sepharose column. the purity of proteins was evaluated by densitometric analysis after staining with coomassie blue and the representative samples of expressed proteins were shown in figure 2b. since hbcag protein can form particles both in vivo and in vitro, we then investigated whether the recombinant proteins can form particles. electron microscopy analysis showed that both hbc-n <dig> and hbc-n149-vp4n <dig> proteins were able to efficiently form particles with the size around 25–30 nm . the results suggest that the chimeric proteins can self-assemble to form vlps.

chimeric particle immunization elicited vp4n <dig> specific antibody responses in mice
to determine whether chimeric hbcag particles were capable of eliciting anti-vp4n <dig> antibody, female balb/c mice were immunized i.m. with either purified chimeric vlps  or hbcag vlps  and received booster injections 3 weeks later. mice immunized with pbs were used as negative controls. the immunized animals were bled at week  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> for serological analysis. the results showed that anti-vp4n <dig> antibody became detectable in chimeric vlps-immunized mice at 2 weeks after inoculation. the titers were enhanced by booster injection and reached a maximum at week  <dig>  no anti-vp4n <dig> antibody response was detected in the hbcag vlps -immunized group and the pbs group. our results indicated that chimeric particles were able to induce anti-vp4n <dig> immune responses .

chimeric vlps were able to induce neutralizing antibodies against ev71
to evaluate whether the chimeric vlps could induce neutralizing antibodies against ev <dig>  sera from immunized mice were tested for the ability to neutralize live ev <dig> in vitro. ev <dig>  and a variant of the prototype strain of ev <dig>  brcr-tr  were used for in vitro neutralization assay. as shown in figure  <dig>  the sera from the group immunized with chimeric vlps were able to neutralize ev <dig>  and prevented rd cells from developing cytopathic effects. the highest neutralizing titre of around  <dig>  ×  <dig> was obtained at week  <dig> post-immunization , which was consistent with the antibody profile as shown in figure  <dig>  however, anti-chimeric vlps sera had a neutralizing activity against ev <dig> of type a  with a neutralization titre similar to that against bj <dig> strain . amino acid sequence alignment show that the n-terminal sequence of the bj <dig> vp <dig> is identical to that of brcr-tr . compared to chimeric particles, hbcag particles failed to induce neutralizing antibody responses against ev <dig>   as well as ev <dig> brcr-tr strain . our results indicate that immunization of chimeric vlps can elicit neutralizing antibody responses against ev <dig> and the sera exhibit a cross-neutralizing activity against ev <dig> strains belonging to different genotypes in vitro.

neonatal mice as a model to verify in vitro neutralizing ability of chimeric vlp-immunized sera
ev <dig> brcr-tr strain was used for viral infection because of its high virulence in neonatal mice. groups of one-day-old balb/c suckling mice  were inoculated intraperitoneally  with the virus-sera mixtures that had been incubated overnight at 37°c. after 7 days, control mice receiving ev <dig> with either pbs or anti- hbcag vlps sera started to show symptoms, such as reduced mobility, limb weakness, limb paralysis, and death . the survival rates were 20% and 40% for the pbs and anti-hbcag vlps sera recipient groups, respectively, at 16 day post-inoculation . in contrast, 90% of mice treated with mixture of anti- chimeric vlps sera remained healthy and survived throughout the course. these observations confirmed previous experiments using rd cells, that immune sera elicited by chimeric particles neutralized ev <dig> infection.

identification of “core sequence” by epitope mapping
vp4n <dig> peptide can elicit neutralizing antibody and conferred cross-protection against ev <dig> strains belonging to different genotypes in vitro. we further investigated the most immunologically essential sequence of the peptide by epitope mapping experiments to find out the minimal peptide sequence showing the highest efficiency for inducing the production of neutralizing antibody. a panel of peptides corresponding to the n- and c-terminal truncations of vp4n <dig> peptide was used for epitope mapping. as shown in figure  <dig>  the polyclonal antibodies raised against the vp4n <dig> peptide were very sensitive to truncation of either end of the peptide. once six  or ten  residues were clipped from either end of the inoculation peptide, the polyclonal antibodies were no longer able to bind. one interpretation of these results is that there is an essential “core” of the peptide that does not tolerate truncation. the “core sequence” is highly conserved amongst the vp <dig> sequences of ev <dig> strains from various genotypes based on the alignment data . our results suggest that vp4n <dig> peptide may potentially elicit a pan-genotypic immune response once the right segment of vp <dig> is identified.

discussion
gene mutation and genetic recombination were frequently observed during ev <dig> epidemics, resulting in substantial genetic variation of ev <dig> genome and the emergence of the various ev <dig> subgenotypes  <cit> . virus variants which possess a selective advantage in terms of ability to evade host immune surveillance can spread and become established within human populations. ev <dig> is classified into  <dig> subgenogroups according to the genetic variation of vp <dig> gene  <cit> . ev <dig> genotype-related hfmd outbreaks were extensively reported previously. genotype b <dig> was the major viral strain in circulation from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . the co-circulation of four subgenotypes c <dig>  c <dig>  b <dig>  and b <dig> were observed in malaysia between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the genotypes b <dig>  c <dig> and b <dig> were reported to be the circulating strains from  <dig> to  <dig> in taiwan  <cit> . one exceptional case was observed in china, where genotype c <dig> was identified as the dominant viral strain responsible for the hfmd outbreak from 2007– <dig>  <cit> . thus, an ideal vaccine should elicit effective cross-neutralizing antibody responses against different genotypes of ev <dig> 

several different types of ev <dig> vaccine candidates have been investigated in animal model, including recombinant vaccines  <cit> , peptide vaccines  <cit> , live attenuated vaccines  <cit>  and formalin-inactivated virion vaccines  <cit> . only inactivated ev <dig> vaccines are being evaluated in human clinical trials due to its superior immunogenicity and more matured manufacturing technologies. inactivated ev <dig> virion vaccines have been found to be able to elicit cross-neutralizing antibody responses against ev <dig> strains of different genotypes in mouse model  <cit> . however, constant genetic evolution has been observed in ev <dig> genome  <cit> , the efficiency of protective immunity elicited by currently used inactivated ev <dig> virion vaccines against novel ev <dig> variants thus still remain to be evaluated. several linear neutralizing epitopes have been identified in the vp <dig> and vp <dig> proteins of ev <dig>  which are very helpful for detailed understanding of broad immunoprotection elicited by inactivated ev <dig> virion vaccines and peptide-based vaccine design  <cit> .

targeting conserved regions within the immunogens for vaccine development is an alternative approach to deal with high genetic diversity of pathogens. ev <dig> vp <dig> gene is more conserved than vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig> genes. we therefore attempted to identify neutralization epitopes in vp <dig> gene. we found that the first 20 n-terminal amino acid residues are highly conserved amongst the vp <dig> sequences of ev <dig> strains from various genotypes. in the present study, the peptide consisting of first  <dig> a.a. at n-terminal of vp <dig> of ev <dig> genotype c <dig>  was fused to hbcag protein. hbcag particles have been extensively exploited as a carrier to improve the immunogenicity of foreign protein segments presented on their surface. as expected, the fusion proteins were able to assemble into chimeric vlps in bacteria as efficient as unmodified hbcag. immunization of the chimeric vlps was able to elicit vp4n <dig> specific antibody in mice. in vitro neutralization assay showed that antibodies raised against chimeric vlps were able to not only neutralize ev <dig> of genotype c <dig> but also displayed a similar neutralizing activity against ev <dig> of genotype a, indicating that immunization of the first 20 n-terminal amino acids of vp <dig> of ev <dig> genotype c <dig> is able to elicit neutralizing antibody which exhibited a broad neutralizing activity against different genotypes of ev <dig> in vitro.

neutralizing antibodies play an important role in the immune defense against picornavirus infection. in the case of poliovirus, antibodies raised against vp <dig> and the n termini of vp <dig> of poliovirus serotype i were capable of neutralizing the poliovirus virions  <cit> . similar results were reported in the studies on rhinovirus, antibodies against the n-terminus of vp <dig> were found to successfully neutralize viral infectivity in vitro <cit> . vp <dig> played a pivotal role during picornavirus cell entry despite the fact that vp <dig> is buried in the interior of the capsid at the capsid-rna interface  <cit> , indicating that the picornavirus capsid structure is more dynamic than the suggested crystal structure. it has been shown that the attachment of picornavirus on the receptor can trigger conformational alteration of virus and lead to the externalization of vp <dig> and the n-terminus of vp <dig>  <cit> . the egress of the myristylated vp <dig> is involved in the formation of channels responsible for the safe release of the picornavirus genome to the cell cytoplasm  <cit> . the exposure of vp <dig> to the outside of the capsid may potentially result in anti-vp <dig> antibody-mediated neutralization against picornavirus. however, our results on neutralizing responses elicited by n-terminus vp <dig> of ev <dig> are consistent with previous reports  <cit> . furthermore, we identified the “core sequence” of n-terminus vp <dig> of ev <dig> responsible for antibody recognition. the “core sequence” is highly conserved amongst the vp <dig> sequences of ev <dig> strains from various genotypes and that of ca <dig>  whether antibody responses elicited by the n-terminus of ev <dig> vp <dig> are capable of neutralizing ca <dig> virions still remains to be investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study identified an immunodominant epitope located at the n-terminal of ev <dig> vp <dig> protein. the fusion proteins of hbcag and n-terminal of ev <dig> vp4-derived peptide were able to spontaneously assemble into chimeric vlps. mice immunization with these chimeric vlps elicited neutralizing antibodies against ev <dig> of different genotypes. the “core sequence” responsible for immune stimulation was found to be highly conserved across different ev <dig> genotypes.
