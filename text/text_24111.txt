BACKGROUND
atherosclerosis is the underlying cause of ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases  <cit> . unstable carotid atherosclerotic plaques can undergo thrombotic complications and trigger acute clinical events  <cit> . in atherosclerotic plaques angiogenesis allows the formation of new microvessels to maintain oxygen and nutrient supply for vascular cells. such processes are potenciated by different molecules secreted by vascular and inflammatory cells  <cit> . neovessel growth occurs in active regions of atherosclerotic lesions undergoing remodelling. our previous studies have demonstrated specific molecular deregulation occurring in these regions, consistent with the promotion of angiogenesis. the new vessels of atherosclerotic lesions may be a focus of instability, since they facilitate the infiltration of inflammatory cells and due to their tendency to leak, may produce haemorrhagic complications  <cit> . in a previous study using protein microarrays, we have identified regulation of potentially proangiogenic proteins associated with haemorrhagic vessels in unstable plaques among them c-jun n-terminal kinase  and c-src  <cit> .

the role of crp modulating of angiogenesis in developing atherosclerotic lesions has not been investigated. crp is an acute-phase reactant expressed during active inflammation  <cit> . inflammation, the key regulator of crp synthesis, plays an important role in atherothrombotic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease  <cit> . crp consists of five identical non-covalently associated and nonglycosylated 23-kda subunits arranged symmetrically around a central pore and it is synthesized mainly in the liver under the control of interleukin- <dig>   <cit> , although it is also found in other tissues including carotid atherosclerotic plaques  <cit> . crp represents one of the strongest independent predictors of symptomatic atherothrombosis and vascular death  <cit>  and predicts progression of atherosclerosis  <cit> . in response to acute-phase stimuli, plasma crp concentration can increase rapidly and dramatically up to 100-fold  <cit> . crp levels are increased in patients at moderate-  and high-risk  of future cardiovascular events  <cit> .

although, originally crp was suggested to be purely a biomarker, recent studies have pointed that it may in fact be a direct mediator of atherosclerosis  <cit> . indeed, crp elicits multiple effects on the vascular wall favouring a proatherosclerotic phenotype. these include attraction of monocytes, mediation of low-density lipoproteins  uptake by macrophages  <cit>  reduction in nitric oxide  release of human ec  <cit> , up-regulation of adhesion molecules  <cit> , stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cell  proliferation and migration  <cit> , increasing matrix metalloproteinase  expression in ec and macrophages  <cit> , activating the complement system  <cit>  and inducing plasminogen activator inhibitor- <dig>  expression and activity in human aortic ec  <cit> . with regard to crp effects on ec, published studies are somewhat controversial. crp has been shown to promote production of the pro-angiogenic molecules such as endothelin- <dig>  and il- <dig> in human saphenous vein ec  <cit> , and activate nf-κb signalling through the cd <dig> receptor  <cit> . in contrast, other studies suggested that ec activation by crp was due to contamination of the commercially obtained protein with lipopolysaccharide  and/or sodium azide  <cit> .

as we have previously demonstrated increased crp expression in unstable highly vascularized regions of carotid lesions, we decided to investigate the angiogenic properties of this molecule. here we show that native crp and not potentially contaminating lps or azide is strongly angiogenic both in vitro and in vivo, and activates the expression of some important pro-angiogenic genes in endothelial cells.

RESULTS
chemotaxis was induced by crp in both hcaec and baec
both native and crpdt significantly increased chemotaxis of hcaec with a maximum effect at  <dig> μg/ml following crpdt treatment  . crp also induced a significant increase in chemotaxis of baec at similar concentrations with a maximum response at  <dig> μg/ml crp . fgf- <dig>  was used as a positive control. lps alone  had no effect on cell migration. blocking experiments were performed with the anti-crp antibody  to ensure that the effect was due to the crp protein itself. the increase in chemotaxis induced by crpdt was significantly reduced following the pre-incubation with antibody. 

crp stimulated baec but not hcaec proliferation
a significant increase in baec proliferation  was seen  <dig> h after treatment with  <dig> μg/ml native crp . treatment of crp with detoxi-gel columns  did not ameliorate proliferation, and in fact, a further increase was shown . at  <dig> μg/ml crpdt also produced a significant effect. endotoxin  alone had no effect on baec proliferation. crp did not affect proliferation of hcaec at any of the concentrations tested .

crp induced tube-like structure formation in hcaec and baec
crp induced the formation of tube-like structures in growth factor depleted matrigel in both hcaec and baec. tube formation increased in crp-treated hcaec by approximately  <dig> fold at 1– <dig> μg/ml . . crpdt and non-detoxified crp produced a similar effect. lps  had no effect. similar results were obtained in baec, in this case the maximal effect was observed at  <dig> and  <dig> μg/ml with crpdt  which are lower than showed by fgf- <dig> treated cells . tube formation was significantly inhibited in cells pre-incubated with anti-crp antibody, p <  <dig>  .

crp stimulated angiogenic sprouting of aortic tissue
we used a rat aortic ring assay to examine the effects of crp on angiogenesis. we showed that crp stimulated microvessel sprouting from the cultured aortic rings   <dig>  ±  <dig> ; fgf- <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ). 

crp induces endothelial cell invasion in a 3d-matrigel™ matrices
we investigated the effects of crpdt on invasion/migration using hcaecs in 3d-matrigel™ matrices. unstimulated hcaec  showed a low level of network formation . however, when an hcaec network was preformed in matrigel™ in the presence of fgf- <dig> , crpdt  stimulated an invasion into a second layer of 3d-matrigel™ matrices .

crp increased the phosphorylation of erk1/2
phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> is a key event associated with mitogenesis in vascular ec, and we have previously shown that its inhibition in baec is sufficient to prevent growth factor stimulation of angiogenesis  <cit> . semi-confluent ecs  cultured in spm for  <dig> h were treated with crp/crpdt  or fgf- <dig> , and incubated for  <dig> min   <cit> . both crp and crpdt notably increased phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> in hcaec  and baec . neither purified endotoxin nor sodium azide induced erk1/ <dig> activation .

crp stimulated gene expression of multiple angiogenic markers
hcaec were treated for various times with crp . table  <dig> shows results obtained by quantitative taqman low-density array analysis corresponding to  <dig> genes involved in angiogenesis that increased more than  <dig>  fold in crp treated hcaec compared to the control azide-only cells  in two separate experiments. these genes were two members of the notch family , vegf receptor- <dig> , the main vegf receptor, the mitogen platelet derived growth factor-beta , cysteine-rich  <dig> , which stimulates angiogenesis following integrin binding, and inhibitor of dna binding  <dig> . no studied angiogenic genes were down-regulated compared with control cells.

discussion
several studies have suggested crp as biomarker for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases  <cit> ; however, this protein also seems to be a mediator of atherosclerosis  <cit> . angiogenesis is a recognised mechanism involved in the development of complicated atherosclerotic plaques and previous studies have provided controversial data regarding the possible angiogenic or anti-angiogenic effect of crp. in this work, we have examined the hypothesis that crp might play a role in modulating angiogenesis, and as such, its presence in vascular regions of developing arterial plaques may be implicated in their progression to unstable, haemorrhagic lesions prone to rupture. our data shows that crp, at concentrations commonly found in the circulation of patients with active carotid disease, is highly pro-angiogenic both in vitro, and in vivo. furthermore, crp activates cell signalling and increases expression of key genes associated with angiogenesis.

in order to show that the effects of crp were due to crp itself and not other components, we have attempted to address the controversy surrounding the influence of ¨contaminants¨ present in commercial preparations of crp. notably, pepys et al. demonstrated that pure natural human crp free from endotoxins and azide, was not pro-inflammatory to macrophages in vitro  <cit> . more specifically, inhibition of huvec cell proliferation, enos gene expression and increased apoptosis measured by activation of caspase-3/ <dig>  have been attributed to the presence of azide in crp preparations. similarly, contaminating lps was shown to increase il- <dig>  icam- <dig> and mcp- <dig> gene expression  <cit> . it is worthy of note, however, that the effects of azide were demonstrated at concentrations  equal to those produced by administration of  <dig> μg/ml crp. in our study, concentrations of crp and therefore azide used in the majority of experiments were much lower and in fact, had no significant effects on cell growth and gene expression as demonstrated in the taqman microarrays. even so, this highlights the importance of using satisfactory controls when conducting this type of assays. in our studies, all of the controls, used for comparison with crp tests, contained equivalent amounts of azide so that direct comparisons were able to be made. finally, in our study, we show that the treatment of crp with detoxi-gel columns did not negate the pro-angiogenic effects of crp. interestingly, assays performed using purified lps at concentrations that were similar to or exceeded those reported in high purity human recombinant crp from our commercial supplier  <cit>  demonstrated no significant effects on baec or hcaec angiogenesis or il- <dig> gene activation. this is in agreement with the recent findings of dasu et al. who showed that purified crp was able to activate il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il-1β, pai- <dig> and enos in toll-like receptor  <dig> knockout haec, indicating that the effects were not due to lps contamination  <cit> .

in this study, we showed that crp induces angiogenesis in vitro in two separate sources of primary cultured vascular ec as well as in vivo as judged by an increase in capillary formation in the cam assay, aortic ring assay and 3d-matrigel. the angiogenic potency of crpdt was quite strong, being 50–75% of that demonstrated by our positive control fgf- <dig> . one other study showed previously that crp induced proliferation of rabbit thoracic ec with a concomitant increase in expression of p-erk1/ <dig>  similar to our own findings  <cit> . in their study, they controlled for lps by measuring levels with the limulus assay which were recorded as <  <dig>  eu/ml. the authors, however, found that increased proliferation occurred only at significantly high crp concentrations of , and furthermore, they did not consider the effects of azide. in agreement with our findings, bello et al , showed that crp increases vegf-a expression via pi3-kinase and erk1/ <dig> pathway and thus could play a role in the angiogenesis process  <cit> . orozlan et al. found no effects of crp on huvec proliferation although they did not supply data indicating the concentration of crp used  <cit> . in our previous studies where we have characterised various types of vascular cells, we have found huvec to be the least responsive to pro-angiogenic stimuli including vegf, fgf- <dig> and oligosaccharides of hyaluronan; therefore, these results are perhaps not surprising  <cit> . the fact that crp did not stimulate hcaec proliferation suggests that there may be variability in cellular responses dependent on cell type, and ec have been shown in many studies to be heterogeneous in this regard. indeed, in contrast to our results, one recent study showed induction of apoptosis in human umbilical ec  incubated with crp, analyzed by tunel and caspase- <dig> activity assay and inhibition  <cit> . however, the above study used  <dig> μg/ml of crp in their assay and we observed a pro-angiogenic effect of crp at  <dig> and  <dig> μg/ml. moreover, the apoptotic effect of crp was demonstrated in huvec and cellular response may be dependent on ec origin. in addition, in the same study the authors showed that crp treatment of monocluclear cells induced production of mmp- <dig> which is involved in extraclellular matrix degradation, cell migration and release of angiogenic factors necessary to elicit angiogesis  <cit>  verma et al. showed that purified crp attenuated no release in human saphenous vein ec, increased apoptosis and inhibited capillary-like tube formation in matrigel at 5– <dig> μg/ml  <cit> ; however, they did not control for the effects of azide. the same authors also demonstrated that crp inhibited ec progenitor differentiation, survival and function through a process involving a reduction in no expression appeared to be carried out without the use of suitable azide and endotoxin controls  <cit> .

our data showing a potent angiogenic effect of crp/crpdt is strongly backed up by the results of our real-time taqman pcr microarrays. using our specifically designed targeted microfluidity cards, we showed up-regulation of key genes involved in promotion of vascularisation. we found  <dig> genes up-regulated by crpdt on hcaec between 12– <dig> h. vegf receptor- <dig> , the main receptor mediating both signal transduction and the biologic responses, including angiogenesis, triggered by vegf in endothelial cells  <cit> , was significantly induced by crpdt. up-regulation of this receptor together with growth factors such as pdgf- b involved in cell proliferation and angiogenesis  <cit> , could be one mechanism through which crp initiates its angiogenic effects. notch <dig> was increased after  <dig> h of crp treatment. notch <dig> is required for formation of correct sprouting and branching patterns during vegf-stimulated angiogenesis in vivo  <cit> . recently, cyclic strain was shown to up-regulate notch <dig> in human vascular ec and this process was responsible for significantly increased tube-formation in matrigel suggesting a role in development of atherosclerosis  <cit> . notch <dig> is other member of the notch family that seems to be critical for vascular cell survival and is required for the arterial identity and maturation of vascular cells  <cit> . one particularly novel finding was the up-regulation of cyr <dig>  cyr <dig> is an extracellular matrix-associated protein expressed within developing vasculature, which promotes angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . cyr <dig> binds directly to the integrin αvβ <dig> present on activated ec and mediates chemotaxis and tube formation. finally, id <dig>  originally identify as a dominant-negative antagonist of the basis helix-loop-helix  transcription factors has been recently involved in vegf-induced angiogenesis in human endothelial cells  <cit> . future work should be addressed to determine the expression, localization and relevance of these proteins in angiogenic regions of developing complicated atherosclerotic lesions.

this discussion would not be complete without a brief mention of the recently characterised modified crp . evidence has emerged that native pentametric crp can change its structural conformation following separation into monomers. following re-arrangement, formation of the mcrp sub-unit has increased binding affinity for plasma membranes, and has been shown to be preferentially expressed in tissues  <cit> . recent evidence suggest that mcrp may be a significantly weaker stimulator of pro-inflammatory molecules in vascular ec , and hence atherogenic effects  <cit> . however, it is important to remember that native crp can be found at high concentration in many hospital patients and most of them do not develop acute cardiovascular events. this suggests that cardiovascular effects of crp if indeed important maybe due to its modified form.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings strongly suggest an important role for crp in modulation of angiogenesis and as such, crp could promote the formation of intimal neovessels of complicated unstable plaques increasing the likelihood of rupture. the distribution of both native and mcrp should be investigated in complicated atherosclerotic plaques and further studies should aim to identify the mechanisms of cell binding and intracellular mechanisms leading to cellular activation.
