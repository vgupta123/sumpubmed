BACKGROUND
hand, foot and mouth disease  threatens infants and children globally  <cit>  and is caused by two main pathogens, cva <dig> and ev <dig>  both of which are members of the enterovirus genus in the picornaviridae family. infection with ev <dig> commonly causes hfmd cases with severe symptoms, such as aseptic meningoencephalitis, brainstem encephalitis, myelitis, myocarditis and pulmonary edema  <cit> . by contrast, infection with cva <dig> generally induces mild and self-limiting clinical symptoms, such as vesicular maculopapular rash, ulcers and pharyngitis  <cit> , and only occasionally results in severe and fatal cases with central nervous system inflammation . cva <dig> infections have contributed to the majority of hfmd cases for decades, and co-infection and genetic recombination between cva <dig> and ev <dig> have occurred frequently, likely leading to large disease breakouts and evolution of both viruses . therefore, greater attention should be paid to investigations of cva <dig> infection mechanisms.

cva16/ev <dig> infections begin with the binding of cellular receptors of the host cell, which were demonstrated to be human scavenger receptor class b member  <dig>  expressed extensively in tissues and human p-selectin glycoprotein ligand- <dig>  expressed primarily in lymphocytes  <cit> . the receptors mediate entry and subsequent replication of viruses. our group described that scarb2-overexpressing cell lines significantly increase their susceptibility to cva16/ev <dig> of various genotypes  <cit> , similar susceptibility increasing effect was also proved in psgl- <dig> overexpressing cells  <cit> . the infection of these viruses causes the disruption of cellular pathways and events. host cell molecular alterations include relocalization of far upstream element binding protein  <dig> , heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein a <dig>  and hnrnp k, phosphorylation of mapk/erk and pi3k/akt pathways to assist virus replication , and cleavage of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4g  by virus protease to inhibit the synthesis of host proteins and induce apoptosis  <cit> . cell death and apoptosis in tissues subsequently result in hfmd symptoms.

in recent years, many studies on hfmd have been conducted at the transcriptome level, most of which use assay technologies to identify markers  of ev71-related clinical symptoms in different tissues or cells . however, the molecular mechanisms underlying vesicular rash formation caused by cva <dig> infection and the potential central nervous system inflammation caused by enterovirus are still largely unknown. in this study, rna-seq and mirna-seq technologies were used to profile the transcriptome alterations in cva16-infected and non-infected  cells, with the aim of gaining greater insight into the underlying mechanisms of cva16-host interactions which may be highly relevant to disease pathogenesis in vivo.

RESULTS
mrna and mirna expression profiles
we analyzed mrna and mirna expression profiles based on mrna-seq and mirna-seq for cva16-infected as well as cva16-non-infected cells to determine how cva <dig> infection affects the function of a cell and the related regulatory mechanisms. in total,  <dig>  m and  <dig>  m mrna-seq reads were generated for cva16-infected and cva16-non-infected cells, respectively. after trimming low quality bases, uniquely mapped rates of reads of these groups were both about 67% . the saturation evaluation  showed that the sequencing data were sufficient for analysis of gene expression. for cva16-infected and cva16-non-infected cells,  <dig>  m and  <dig>  m short reads of mirna sequences were generated, respectively. we mapped mirna clean short reads to a human pre-mirna database and obtained  <dig>  and  <dig> % mapped rates and detected  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas for cva16-infected and cva16-non-infected cells, respectively .table  <dig> mapping results of rna-seq data for cva16-infected and cva16-non-infected cell samples





among the identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes,  <dig> genes were up-regulated genes and  <dig> were down-regulated genes in cva16-infected relative to cva16-non-infected samples . the  <dig> differentially expressed genes were enriched in  <dig> third-level gene ontology  terms , mainly those involved in the regulation of cellular processes, cellular macromolecule metabolic processes and regulation of metabolic processes. the  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas identified included  <dig> up-regulated mirnas and  <dig> down-regulated mirnas in cva16-infected cells relative to cva16-non-infected cells . therefore,  <dig> differentially expressed target genes were predicted between cva16-infected and cva16-non-infected cells .fig.  <dig> differential gene expression between cva16-non-infected and cva16-infected cell samples. a top  <dig> differentially expressed genes. b top  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas. c top  <dig> differentially expressed target genes. blue represents cva6-non-infected. red represents cva6- infected




the expression regulation of scarb <dig> in cva16-infected cells
virus infection is generally known to alter the expression of host genes and affect protein function. thus, studying expression patterns of host genes may facilitate their use as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for diseases. cva <dig> infection can cause clinical symptoms of hfmd, such as aphthous ulcers, cough and central nervous system dysfunctions. we found that the scarb <dig> gene was the most differentially expressed, as its level in cva16-infected cells was  <dig> times higher than that of cva16-non-infected cells . by quantitative rt-pcr  analysis, the copy number of scarb <dig> mrna in cva16-infected cells also was confirmed to be increased compared to that of the control . furthermore, levels of the scarb <dig> protein in cva16-infected cells were shown to be increased in a dose-dependent pattern . scarb <dig> is the cell membrane receptor for cva16/ev <dig>  and the up-regulation of its expression may increase the chance of co-infection with two viruses in a single cell. this finding would partly explain the large number of cases of ev <dig> and cva <dig> co-circulation and genetic recombination. we also found that the mirna hsa-mir-3605-5p, which targets the scarb <dig> gene, was down-regulated in cva16-infected cells. the mirna hsa-mir-3605-5p plays an important role in the processes of metal ion transport, monovalent inorganic cation transport, intracellular transport and transmembrane transport. similarly, the major function of scarb <dig> in the cell is membrane transport  <cit> . therefore, we inferred that the down-regulation of hsa-mir-3605-5p mediates the high expression of scarb <dig> fig.  <dig>

function enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes
these differentially expressed target genes between cva16-infected and cva16-non-infected cells were clustered into four functional pathways: ecm-receptor interaction, circadian rhythm, abc transporters and lysine degradation . we found that all of the differentially expressed target genes clustered in these four kegg functional pathways were up-regulated . some differentially expressed genes, regulated by mirna, clustered in the ecm-receptor interaction pathway, which may be closely related to symptoms caused by cva <dig> infection: aphthous ulcers, cough and myocarditis. bakir-gungor et al.  <cit>  recently discovered that oral aphthous ulcers of behcet’s disease may be correlated with the ecm-receptor interaction. gunawardhana et al.  <cit>  also found that inflammation of the airway is affected by the ecm-receptor interaction. the ecm in the heart and vascular wall consists of fibrous proteins and proteoglycans  <cit> , which are important for maintenance of both the structure and function of the heart and vascular tissues  <cit> . excessive deposition of ecm proteins has also been associated with many cardiac pathological entities such as myocardial fibrosis after myocardial infarction  <cit> . therefore, we had reason to believe that the ecm-receptor interaction may be involved with symptoms of myocarditis, such as aphthous ulcers and cough, in some patients infected with cva <dig>  at the same time, we found that most of the differently expressed genes  in the ecm-receptor interaction were modulated by the down-regulation of mirnas hsa-mir-149-3p and hsa-mir-5001-5p . these genes regulated by hsa-mir-149-3p or hsa-mir-5001-5p, including itga <dig>  agrn, col5a <dig>  hspg <dig>  lama <dig>  lama <dig>  col11a <dig>  itga <dig> and itga <dig>  are all related to diseases.table  <dig> clustering functional pathways of differentially expressed mirna target genes

another observed enrichment pathway was the circadian rhythm pathway. differentially expressed genes associated with the circadian rhythm pathway included nr1d <dig>  csnk1d, clock, per <dig> and per <dig>  these genes were all up-regulated and related to the sleep phase syndrome and circadian clock. in other words, somnolence caused by cva <dig> infection was correlated with the circadian rhythm pathway. radomski et al. found that patients suffering from meningoencephalitis demonstrated circadian disruptions in cortisol, prolactin and sleep-wake rhythms. sleeping sickness at the stage of meningoencephalitis manifests itself as a significant disturbance in the circadian rhythm of sleep-wakefulness  <cit> . buguet et al. also found that the stage of meningoencephalitis in patients suffering from human african trypanosomiasis  represented a dysregulation of the sleep-wake cycle and sleep structure, rather than hypersomnia, and this dysregulation was accompanied by a circadian dysrhythmia of hormonal secretions. this finding shown that the meningoencephalitis is related to the circadian rhythm  <cit> . other reports have shown that meningoencephalitis is one of the typical symptoms after ev <dig> infection . meningoencephalitis has also frequently appeared as one of the symptoms of coxsackie b virus infection  <cit> . as cv infection has been reported to cause lethargic encephalitis and mild paralysis in children  <cit> , we deduced that cva <dig> interferes with intracellular circadian rhythms leading to somnolence with meningoencephalitis. here, we found that 80%  of the differentially expressed target genes clustered in the circadian rhythm pathway also are regulated by down-regulation of the mirnas hsa-mir-149-3p and hsa-mir-5001-5p . therefore, we deduced that the down-regulation of these two mirnas may result in up-regulation of genes in morbigenous pathways related with cva <dig> and further cause clinical symptoms.

CONCLUSIONS
we examined the impact of infection with cva <dig>  a major causative pathogen of hfmd, using rna-seq and mirna-seq technologies to reveal the associated pathogenic mechanisms at the transcriptome level. we highlighted that the scarb <dig> gene was up-regulated by nearly 10-fold in infected cells compared to non-infected 293t cells at the transcriptional and translational levels. scabr <dig> serving as a cellular receptor plays an important role in co-infections of ev <dig> and cva <dig>  and has-mir-3605-5p regulates the high expression of scarb <dig>  we found that differentially expressed mirna target genes were mainly concentrated in the ecm-receptor interaction and circadian rhythm pathways, which may be related to clinical symptoms of patients infected with cva <dig>  such as aphthous ulcers, cough, myocarditis and somnolence of meningoencephalitis. down-regulation of mirnas hsa-mir-149-3p and hsa-mir-5001-5p may result in up-regulation of genes in these morbigenous pathways related to cva <dig> infection, which further leads to clinical phenotypes.
