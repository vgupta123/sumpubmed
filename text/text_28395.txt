BACKGROUND
hibernation is an adaptive strategy used by some animals to survive cold winter weather when food is scarce  <cit> . small mammalian hibernators  undergo a series of torpor-arousal cycles during hibernation, in which a torpor bout lasts for several days or weeks but an arousal bout lasts only several hours  <cit> . during torpor, the metabolic rate  of these mammals is reduced to 2- <dig> % of the euthermic metabolism, and their body temperature  may fall just a few degrees above the ambient temperature; however, both their mr and tb are rapidly restored to the euthermic levels upon arousal  <cit> . the body weight and fat mass of these hibernators are dramatically increased in the pre-hibernation season. the preserved fats are used as the primary energy source during hibernation  <cit> .

bats belong to the order chiroptera in the mammalian clade laurasiatheria  <cit> . they comprise almost 1-quarter of mammalian species and are the only flying mammals  <cit> . hibernating bats  are mostly distributed in subtropical or cold latitudes, whereas non-hibernating bats are mainly reside in warm subtropical or tropical latitudes  <cit> . many hibernating bat species in genera myotis and rhinolophus are deep hibernators that stringently control their overall metabolism during torpor  <cit> . positive selection in the coding regions of some genes, such as leptin and bssl, is found in these bats, suggesting that lipid metabolism has undergone adaptive evolution in response to hibernation  <cit> .

peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors  are nuclear receptors that regulate the expression of many genes  involved in lipid and glucose homeostasis  <cit>  and the development of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension in mammals  <cit> . ligand-dependent transcriptional regulation by ppars depends on the heterodimerization of ppars with their coactivators . ppars can also be activated directly in a ligand-independent manner by phosphorylation  <cit> .  <dig> different subtypes  of ppars have been identified. pparα is activated upon energy deprivation and is highly expressed in the liver, heart, kidney, and adipose tissues  <cit> , while subtypes β and γ, expressed ubiquitously, are associated with cell migration and adipocyte differentiation, respectively  <cit> .

the actions of pparα are regulated by the fibroblast growth factor  <dig> , and the pparα-fgf <dig> signaling cascade has been shown to induce torpor in fasting mice  <cit> . pparα is recently shown to shift fuel utilization from carbohydrate to lipid during torpor of arctic ground squirrel, urocitellus parryii  <cit> . a positive selection at the glycine residue of codon  <dig>  of pparα has been detected in members of super-clade laurasiatheria  and suborders of euarchontoglires   <cit> . in addition, increased expression of pparγ and its co-activator pgc-1α is observed in spermophilus tridecemlineatus squirrels during a cold-induced torpor  <cit> . the expression of these  <dig> proteins is also increased in many organs of torpid myotis lucifugus bats  <cit> .

although differential expression of ppars and their co-activators  has been investigated in some hibernating mammals during different phases of hibernation  <cit> , the evolution of pparα in hibernating bats remains unknown. since pparα plays a significant role in metabolic regulation during torpor  <cit> , we hypothesize that pparα has evolved in bats in adaption to hibernation. to test this hypothesis, we studied the evolution of pparα in fifty-six species of mammals including twelve species of bats. we also compared mrna and protein expression of pparα in hibernating bats between torpid and arousal states. the number of potential pparα target genes and the binding affinity of pparα to these genes in hibernating and non-hibernating bats and other mammalian species were also determined.

RESULTS
higher selection pressure on pparα in hibernating bats
to determine whether the coding region of pparα is positively selected in bats in response to hibernation, we conducted a branch model test on pparα from  <dig> hibernating and  <dig> non-hibernating species of bats by the maximum likelihood method using other mammalian species as an out-group . although some of the branches were short and might lead to inaccurate estimation of ω , the ω value of the ancestral lineage of hibernating bats in both yinpterochiroptera  and yangochiroptera  was found to be lower than that of non-hibernating bats in yin , suggesting a higher selective pressure acting on pparα in hibernating bats. a significant lower ω value was obtained by the 2-ratio model e  when the ancestral branch of hibernating bats in yang was labeled for comparison with other branches, indicating that pparα is much more conserved in this lineage . it is conceivable that such conservation is required for the survival of hibernating bats, especially for those living in relatively low latitudes . no positive selection on any amino acid of pparα was found in the ancestral branches of hibernating bats in both yin and yang using the branch-site model a test . there was also no positively selected site detected in these bats using the site model test . however, pparα was found conserved across  <dig> mammalian species and experienced a higher selective pressure  in ancestral chiroptera . these data suggest that pparα is conserved in evolution and support the previous postulation that heterothermy is an ancestral chiropteran trait  <cit> . a positive selection on codons  <dig> and  <dig>  of pparα was detected in these mammals by site model comparisons  . this result is consistent with the positive selection on codon  <dig>  of pparα observed in super-clade laurasiatheria  and suborders of euarchontoglires   <cit> .fig.  <dig> species tree of pparα of bats. non-hibernating bats in yinpterochiroptera, hibernating bats in yinpterochiroptera, and hibernating bats in yangochiroptera are represented by orange, green, and blue colors, respectively. the n × d

upregulation of pparα expression in torpid bats
we next investigated the possibility that bat pparα is adapted to hibernation at the level of transcription. the amount of pparα mrna in the liver of torpid bats was compared to that of active bats, including the distantly related rhinolophus ferrumequinum and hipposideros armiger bats in yin and myotis ricketti bats in yang . results of quantitative pcr showed that pparα mrna levels were significantly higher in torpid states than in active states and were increased by  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  fold in torpid r. ferrumequinum, h. armiger, and m. ricketti bats, respectively . these results indicate that pparα in bats adapts to hibernation at the level of transcription.fig.  <dig> expression levels of pparα mrna determined by real-time rt pcr. rf, ha, and mr represent hibernating r. ferrumequinum, h. armiger, and m. ricketti bats, respectively. relative mrna levels in torpid and active states are indicated with light blue and dark blue colors, respectively. the expression level of pparα in active bats was set as  <dig> . data are presented as mean ± sd. a p value <  <dig>  is considered statistically significant



the mechanisms for pparα upregulation in torpid bats remain to be investigated. during hibernation, lipid is the main fuel source, and a complex lipid signaling exists not only on the cell membrane but also in the nucleus  <cit> . lipid signaling has a close relationship with the signaling pathways of numerous biological processes, such as inflammation, immunity, and glucose and amino acid metabolism  <cit> . ppars are known to be activated by fatty acids and their derivatives  <cit> . as some transcription factors may also activate pparα transcription, we used bioinformatic approaches to search for those that can bind to the  <dig> potential regulatory regions of pparα, including the region around the transcription start site , the region upstream from tss , and the gene body  .

we found that transcription factors foxl <dig>  nfya, nfyb, sp <dig>  tbp, and erg can bind to various regulatory regions of pparα in hibernating bats . in contrast, the nf-κb p <dig> subunit  and e2f <dig> were found to have the potential to bind to the regulatory regions of pparα in non-hibernating bats . foxl <dig> is a forkhead box transcription factor and is crucial for liver development and function. knockdown of foxl <dig> in mice leads to defective intestinal glucose uptake  <cit> . nfya, nfyb, and sp <dig> work cooperatively with pparα to regulate the transcription of many lipogenic genes  <cit> . tbp is a tata box binding protein that interacts with pparα to mediate gene transcription  <cit> . e2f <dig> regulates the expression of many genes involved in cell cycle control and proliferation  <cit> . rela is a pleiotropic tf associated with the regulation of inflammation and immunity. its activity is repressed by ligand-bound ppars  <cit> .

it is known that e2f <dig> competes with histone deacetylase  <dig>  for binding to sp <dig>  <cit> . the activity of hdac <dig> is significantly elevated in the skeletal muscle of spermophilus tridecemlineatus ground squirrels during hibernation  <cit> . in these squirrels, the activation of nf-κb in skeletal muscle and intestine is positively linked to the antioxidant defense  <cit> . nf-κb is also activated in the heart and muscle of torpid myotis lucifugus bats  <cit> . these observations indicate that nf-κb and e2f <dig> are critical for hibernation. since down regulation of pparα depends on an intact signaling pathway of rela  <cit>  and e2f <dig>   <cit> , the potential of rela and e2f <dig> to bind to the regulatory regions of pparα in non-hibernating bats suggests their roles in transcriptional repression of pparα. similar binding preferences of foxl <dig>  nfya, nfyb, sp <dig>  tbp, erg, rela, and e2f <dig> on pparα were found in many other mammalian species .

elevated production of pparα in torpid bats
to correlate the mrna level of pparα with its protein level, we determined the amounts of pparα protein in mice, hibernating rhinolophus ferrumequinum, hipposideros armiger, and myotis ricketti bats, and non-hibernating rousettus leschenaultii bats by western blotting. mouse pparα  protein was used as the positive control . for each hibernating bat, the amount of pparα in the torpid state  was compared to that in the active state . the levels of pparα were found to be increased by  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  fold in torpid r. ferrumequinum, h. armiger, and m. ricketti bats, respectively  . these results were consistent with the elevated expression of pparα mrna in these bats during hibernation .fig.  <dig> expression levels of pparα in bats determined by western blotting.  western blotting results of pparα.  relative levels of pparα. the expression level of the pparα protein in mice  was set as  <dig>  and that of pparα in each bat species was relative to it. rf, ha, and mr represent hibernating r. ferrumequinum, h. armiger, and m. ricketti bats, respectively. rl represents non-hibernating r. leschenaultii bats. t and a indicate bats in torpid and active states, respectively. arrowheads in  indicate molecular weights  of protein markers. relative levels of the pparα protein in mice , torpid  and active  bats, and non-hibernating bats  are shown in . results are presented as mean ± sd. a p value <  <dig>  is considered significant



because the expression of pparα was upregulated in distantly related hibernating bats and its expression level was higher in torpid bats than in active and non-hibernating bats , these results strongly suggest the adaptation of bat pparα to hibernation. the sizes of pparα detected in samples from r. ferrumequinum and h. armiger bats were slightly higher than expected . this discrepancy may be due to variations in post-translational modifications  of pparα as described previously  <cit> . the expression of pparα in mice was found to be higher than in all the hibernating and nonhibernating bats examined , suggesting a potential hibernation capability of mice. this possibility is supported by the adenosine-induced torpid mice recently established by swaop et al.  <cit> .

in addition to using fat as the main energy source, bats maintain their blood glucose at 2–3 mm and catabolize amino acids to generate ketone bodies for energy supply during torpor  <cit> . ppars are known to be involved in lipid metabolism and other cellular processes, such as insulin sensitivity, amino acid homeostasis, adaptation to starvation, and inflammation  <cit> . overexpression of pparα activates nearly every gene associated with fatty acid catabolism  <cit> . furthermore, pparα-null mice exhibit increased glucose utilization, diminished fatty acid oxidation  <cit> , and elevated expressions of many genes  involved in amino acid metabolism  <cit> . since hibernating mammals progressively suppress glucose utilization and use fat as the primary fuel  <cit> , it is conceivable that bats produce sufficient amounts of pparα to meet their metabolic requirements during torpor. previous studies indicated that pparα homeostasis is regulated by heterodimerization, recruitment of cofactors, post-translational modifications, and micro-rnas   <cit> . such regulation and the possible cross-talk among the various transcription factors observed in this study agree with the notion that transcriptional or translational reprogramming of genes occurs during mammalian hibernation  <cit> .

variation of amino acid sequences of pparα in bats
to investigate the adaptation of pparα to hibernation, we compared the amino acid sequences of pparα from  <dig> hibernating and  <dig> non-hibernating species of bats. the human pparα sequence was used as the template. in the aligned region ,  <dig> amino acid sites were identical  and  <dig> amino acid sites were variable .

 <dig> positions including v <dig>  y <dig>  i <dig>  t <dig>  and i <dig> of pparα were conserved in hibernating bats but were different or divergent among non-hibernating bats.  <dig> amino acid sites of pparα were conserved in non-hibernating bats but were different among hibernating bats. missense mutations at v <dig> and y <dig> of pparα had been reported in carcinomas of the large intestine and liver, respectively  <cit> , and missense mutation at g <dig> had been observed in malignant melanoma  <cit> . the amino acid site  <dig> is located in the zinc-finger motif  of pparα . these results suggest the important role of these conserved amino acid sites in pparα. taken together, these data agree with the conservation and functional constraint of pparα toward evolution .

potential pparα target genes
genome-wide bioinformatic analyses were performed to estimate the mean ratio of the number of pparα potential target genes to the number of all annotated genes  in bats and to calculate the mean affinity score of pparα to its target genes.  <dig> species of hibernating bats myotis brandtii, myotis davidii, myotis lucifugus, and eptesicus fuscus were found to have a higher mean target gene ratio than non-hibernating pteropus vampyrus bats , and the mean affinity score of pparα to its target genes of these hibernating bats was higher than that of non-hibernating bats, pteropus vampyrus and pteropus alecto . these results imply that mammalian hibernators have more pparα target genes than non-hibernators and that pparα has a higher binding affinity to its target genes in hibernators than in non-hibernators. to test these possibilities, the mean ratio of the number of pparα potential target genes to the number of all genes in each of the  <dig> hibernating species and  <dig> non-hibernating species of mammals was determined; the mean affinity score of pparα to its target genes in each of these mammalian species was also calculated. results showed that the mean target gene ratio of the hibernators was significantly higher than that of the non-hibernators at a p value threshold of  <dig> x 10− <dig> . this result was consistent across different settings of threshold p values . the mean affinity score of pparα to its target genes in the hibernators was  <dig>  ±  <dig> , which is significantly higher than the score  <dig>  ±  <dig>  of the non-hibernators . these data showed that hibernating mammals have more pparα target genes and that pparα has a higher affinity to its target genes in hibernating than in non-hibernating mammals.fig.  <dig> bioinformatic analyses of pparα in mammals. the y-axis in  represents the ratios of the number of pparα potential target genes to the number of all genes of different animals. the small open rectangle indicates the threshold setting  for the matrix scan. the scores in  indicate the binding affinity of pparα to its target genes in different animals. blue and pink boxes indicate data calculated from  <dig> hibernating species  and  <dig> non-hibernating species  of mammals. each dot represents the mean value obtained from each mammalian species. the box plot shows the median, 25/ <dig> percentiles , and 10/ <dig> percentiles . a p value <  <dig>  is considered significant



to investigate phylogenetic inferences  <cit> , we constructed a phylogenetic tree of  <dig> mammals . the correlation between mammalian hibernation and the target gene ratio, or affinity score of pparα, was analyzed by  <dig> different phylogenetic comparative methods, including the quantitative genetic threshold model proposed by felsenstein  <cit>  and the phylogenetic anova proposed by garland et al.  <cit>  . with both approaches, we found that the correlation between hibernation and affinity score of pparα was significant . the correlation between hibernation and target gene ratio of pparα was also significant  . however, the correlation coefficients were substantially decreased if the phylogeny of these mammals was considered. therefore, phylogenesis is an important factor in the analysis of evolutionary adaptation of mammalian hibernation.

differential gene expression plays a key role in the evolution of morphological phenotypes and some biological traits  <cit> . the evolution of phenotypic fitness is influenced, in part, by the divergent pattern of tf binding sites and different affinities of tfs to their binding sites. the crosstalk among tfs regulates transcription, ultimately leading to the complex phenotypes  <cit> . it has been shown that tf binding sites evolve rapidly in order to adapt to metabolic control and detoxification in the liver  <cit> . our observations of more pparα target genes and a higher binding affinity of pparα to its target genes in hibernating mammals suggest an important regulatory role of pparα in hibernation. it is probable that the genomes of hibernators have evolved to adapt to hibernation.

mammalian hibernation is an ideal model to investigate the role of differential gene expression in adaptive evolution  <cit> . the coding regions of most differentially expressed genes are shaped by purifying selection  <cit> . a recent comparative genomic study of  <dig> hibernating and several non-hibernating species of mammals found no signs of positive selection on the coding regions of genes associated with hibernation  <cit> . however, differential expression of genes of metabolic pathways commonly shared by  <dig> hibernating species  was found, indicating the pivotal role of regulation of gene expression in mammalian hibernation  <cit> . our findings together with previous reports  <cit>  suggest that both genomic information  and genomic processes  of pparα have evolved toward adaptation to hibernation. more comparative studies of tf binding between torpid and active mammals or between hibernating and non-hibernating species will allow us to gain further insights into the evolution of mammalian hibernation.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we found pparα upregulation at both mrna and protein levels in bat liver during torpor, providing clear evidence of pparα in adaptation to mammalian hibernation. mechanisms by which bats upregulate the transcription and translation of pparα to achieve a torpid phenotype remain to be investigated. a complex crosstalk among different tfs, such as foxl <dig>  nfya, nfyb, sp <dig>  tbp, erg, rela, and e2f <dig>  may be involved in the control of pparα expression. results of evolutionary analyses and amino acid sequence alignments indicated that pparα is highly conserved among hibernators. bioinformatic analyses revealed that the genomes of mammalian hibernators have evolved to become more susceptible to pparα regulation.
