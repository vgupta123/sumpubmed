BACKGROUND
the world health organization has estimated that nearly one-third of the world's population is now latently infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis and 8– <dig> million people develop active disease resulting in  <dig> million deaths each year  <cit> . the prevalence of this infection is largely due to the extended dormancy of m. tuberculosis in the host and its ability to cause disease even in the face of a highly orchestrated host immune response  <cit> .

m. tuberculosis is believed to primarily invade and replicate within alveolar macrophages  <cit> . it has the ability to enter a <dig> cells of alveolar epithelial origin in culture  <cit>  and also invade other non-phagocytic cells  <cit> .

role of mce1a protein in the entry and survival of the pathogen is demonstrated using recombinant e. coli carrying cloned copy of the gene as well as latex microspheres coated with recombinant mce1a protein, both of which were able to enter hela cells  <cit> . additionally, it has been demonstrated that the recombinant e. coli expressing mce1a can survive longer in these cells  <cit> . the continued analysis of the four mce operons of m. tuberculosis h37rv genome has shown significant conservation of the protein sequences in the four operons  <cit> . the redundancy of these operons is explained by functional significance of the different mce operons of m. tuberculosis h37rv by various studies including ours  <cit> . earlier we reported the expression of mce <dig> and absence of mce <dig> transcripts in the specific tissues of both infected rabbits and guinea pigs during advanced disease conditions, which suggested that mce <dig> operon, may have a role in the long term survival of m. tuberculosis in host's tissue  <cit> . the survival mechanism of dormant tubercle bacilli is still under intense research  <cit> . it is suggested that mycobacterial persistence may rise as a response to environmental stress, such as reduced oxygen concentration within a host tissue  <cit> . it is demonstrated that deletion mutants of mce <dig> and mce <dig> operons of m. tuberculosis h37rv are attenuated in mice  <cit> . by deleting eight genes and the first  <dig> bp of the ninth gene from mce <dig> operon it was shown that survival of m. tuberculosis was significantly reduced in mice  <cit> . however, direct involvement of individual proteins from mce <dig> operon in the survival or uptake of m. tuberculosis into the mammalian cells was not demonstrated.

in the present study we validate the role of mce4a protein of mce <dig> operon not only in cell invasion but also in survival of the pathogen in human macrophages using recombinant e. coli expressing cloned mce4a gene. the cellular localization and in vitro expression of the mce4a protein in m. tuberculosis was also analyzed.

methods
bacterial strains, cells and culture conditions
m. tuberculosis h37rv was grown as shake-cultures in middlebrook 7h <dig> broth  supplemented with oadc  and 2% glycerol at 37°c.

e. coli dh5α and bl- <dig>  cells were grown in luria-bertani  broth or on lb agar in presence of kanamycin  where ever appropriate. the human epithelial cell line hela cells were grown in complete dulbecco's modified eagle's medium  supplemented with  <dig> mm sodium pyruvate , 10% fbs , hepes  and  <dig> μg of penicillin-streptomycin/ml . thp- <dig> monocyte cell line was cultured in rpmi  <dig>  supplemented with 10% fcs  and  <dig> mm l-glutamine . both the cell lines were grown at 37°c in presence of 5% co <dig>  pma  was used for the adhesion of thp- <dig> cells.

cloning, expression and purification of mce1a and mce4a
genomic dna from m. tuberculosis h37rv was extracted according to the ctab  method  <cit> . full length mce1a  and mce4a  genes were amplified from m. tuberculosis genomic dna  <cit>  by polymerase chain reaction  using the primers mce1f and mce1r for mce1a gene, mce4f and mce4r for mce4a gene as listed in table  <dig>  each forward primer contained saci restriction enzyme site whereas the reverse primers contained a hindiii restriction site.

* restriction sites in primers are indicated in bold letters.

the amplicons were cloned in pet28a  to generate pet28a/mce1a and pet28a/mce4a with hexa histidine tags. both dh5α and bl- <dig>  strains of e. coli were transformed with the recombinant plasmids for expression studies. the presence of the inserts was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing.

overnight grown culture of e. coli bl- <dig>  containing the recombinant expression plasmids was diluted 1: <dig> in fresh lb broth containing kanamycin and grown with vigorous shaking at 37°c to an optical density  of  <dig>  at  <dig> nm. for transcription induction, iptg  to a final concentration of  <dig>  mm was added to the culture and incubation was continued for  <dig> h. the n-terminal his-tagged recombinant proteins were purified under denaturing condition on nitrilotriacetic acid  agarose columns  according to the manufacturer's instructions.

production of polyclonal antibodies against mce4a protein
the antibodies against the mce4a protein were raised in 5-month-old female nzw rabbit. for each immunization,  <dig> μg of protein in  <dig>  ml pbs was mixed with  <dig>  ml of incomplete freund's adjuvant  and administered subcutaneously at five sites in rabbit, followed by four booster injections of  <dig> μg each  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> weeks after the first injection. serum was prepared from blood collected  <dig> weeks after the last booster dose. the animal handling was according to the guidelines of the institutional ethical committee and indian council of medical research, india.

preparation of subcellular fractions
m. tuberculosis h37rv was grown in one liter of 7h <dig> middlebrook medium to mid-log phase  at 37°c on shaking  up to an od of  <dig>  at  <dig> nm. cells were harvested by centrifugation at  <dig>  g for  <dig> min and the culture supernatant was concentrated to obtain the culture filtrate protein . pelleted cells were washed, resuspended in pbs and subcellular fractions were prepared as previously described  <cit> . similarly, cellular fractions were also prepared from the stationary phase culture  of m. tuberculosis h37rv.

detection of protein expression
the protocol followed for western blotting of purified mce1a and mce4a proteins was as described previously  <cit> . anti-his monoclonal antibody  and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg  were used as primary and secondary antibody respectively. western blot was carried out to detect purified mce4a protein and also the expression of mce4a protein in the whole cell lysate of cells harvested on day  <dig> , day  <dig> , day  <dig> , and day  <dig>  post inoculation. polyclonal anti-mce4a antibody  raised in rabbits, was used as the primary antibody. for the intracellular localization of mce4a protein in m. tuberculosis, western blotting was performed with cytoplasmic , cell membrane , cell wall  fractions, culture filtrate protein  and whole cell lysate  prepared from both log and stationary phase culture as described above.

invasion assay and electron microscopy
invasion of hela cells seeded at  <dig> ×  <dig> cells per well into 6-well plates by bl- <dig> cells transformed with pet28a/mce1a, pet28a/mce4a and empty vector pet28a was assayed. bacterial cultures grown overnight were diluted  in fresh medium containing kanamycin and incubated further with vigorous shaking to reach an od of  <dig>  at  <dig> nm and induced with  <dig>  mm iptg for  <dig> h at 37°c. following the induction, the cells were washed once with pbs and resuspended in  <dig> ml of pbs. prior to the infection, monolayer of hela cells were charged with fresh medium  and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> min. recombinant e. coli cells were added to the monolayer at a multiplicity of infection  of 10: <dig> and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> h, washed three times with pbs and processed for electron microscopy as described previously  <cit>  and examined under cm- <dig> electron microscope. since the e. coli strain used is kanamycin resistant, the cells were not treated with kanamycin or gentamycin but were extensively washed post-infection to remove the extra-cellular bacteria that failed to enter the mammalian cells.

survival assay
thp- <dig> cells were seeded at  <dig> ×  <dig> cells per well into 12-well plates. pma  was added for the cell adhesion. recombinant bacterial cultures induced with iptg were incubated with thp- <dig> cells at a moi of 10: <dig>  prior to the infection, thp- <dig> cells were charged with fresh medium  and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> min. infection was continued for  <dig> h at 37°c.

following  <dig> h incubation, the cells in all the wells were washed three times with fcs free rpmi. one set of cells were lysed immediately after  <dig> h of incubation. the cfu at this time point was taken as t <dig> . the other sets were lysed after  <dig> h  and  <dig> h  of incubation. briefly, the cells were incubated for  <dig> min in  <dig> μl of lysis buffer . the lysate was plated on lb agar plates and incubated at 37°c overnight and recombinant e. coli colonies were counted. the numbers of e. coli able to survive at  <dig> h and  <dig> h post infection were normalized against cfu at t <dig> and expressed as percentage survival. experiment was done in triplicate.

statistical analysis
the cfu of recombinant e. coli and the percentage survival of recombinant e. coli cells are represented as mean ± standard deviation. the difference in percentage survival of recombinant e. coli cells  as compared to e. coli  was calculated using student's t test using graph pad prismtm software.

RESULTS
cloning, expression and purification of mce1a and mce4a proteins
the expression of the fusion proteins was studied in e. coli bl- <dig>  strain. the his-tagged mce1a and mce4a were expressed at high level on induction with iptg and the purified proteins were detected using anti-his-tag monoclonal antibody . the fusion proteins were of the expected size of  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda respectively . further we confirmed the identity of purified mce4a protein with rabbit anti-mce4a polyclonal antibodies raised in our laboratory . mce4a was purified as a single band, while mce1a was detected as a doublet. since anti-his-tag antibodies detected the lower molecular weight band, it is probably due to partial degradation. similar profile for mce1a protein was reported earlier also  <cit> .

growth-phase dependent expression and subcellular localization of mce4a protein of m. tuberculosis
immunochemical detection of mce4a protein in whole cell lysate from different phase of m. tuberculosis cultures shows that it is expressed only in stationary phase culture  and the subcellular fractions from stationary phase culture show that mce4a is localized in cell wall fraction only . in a similar experiment subcellular fraction from mid-log phase culture of m. tuberculosis h37rv, antibodies against mce4a did not detect any protein either in whole cell lysate or any subcellular fraction , which indicates absence of expression of mce4a during early phase of growth.

invasion of hela cells by recombinant e. coli expressing mce4a protein
the invasion of hela cells by recombinant e. coli was monitored by transmission electron microscopy. the results show that uninduced e. coli   were not able to enter the hela cells while iptg induced recombinant e. coli expressing mce4a protein  and mce1a protein  were able to invade the hela cells. the invaded hela cells showed membrane-ruffling, presence of multiple invaginations at the cell membrane and multiple vacuolations in the cells . internalized recombinant e. coli were observed within the cytoplasmic vacuoles . the e. coli  used as a negative control failed to enter the hela cells .

role of mce4a protein in survival of e. coli in the thp- <dig> macrophages
to determine the role of mce4a protein in survival of m. tuberculosis within macrophages, the thp- <dig> cells were infected with recombinant e. coli expressing mce4a or mce1a at moi of 10: <dig> and percentage survival was determined at  <dig> h and  <dig> h post-infection. the percentage survival at  <dig> h post-infection of e. coli  and e. coli  was significantly higher than that of e. coli  at the same time points post-infection  . at  <dig> h post-infection, negligible number of colonies of e. coli  was obtained from lysed cells as compared to that from e. coli  and e. coli  . at  <dig> h and  <dig> h percentage survival of e. coli  was comparable to that of e. coli  .

survival was assayed as colony forming units per milliliter of lysate following lysis of the infected cells. time points considered were as follows: t <dig> -  <dig> hour, t <dig> -  <dig> hours and t <dig> -  <dig> hours, post-infection. all values were normalised to t <dig> value taken as 100%. the significance was calculated using t test. recombinant e. coli expressing mce4a or mce1a survived inside thp- <dig> cells at a significantly high cfu as compared to recombinant e. coli with vector alone.

discussion
the initial step in the pathogenesis by intracellular pathogens is the invasion of host cells. in case of m. tuberculosis, mce1a protein of mce <dig> operon was the first protein of the pathogen to be implicated in invasion and survival inside macrophages  <cit> . although mce2a protein of mce <dig> operon exhibits 67% amino acid identity with mce1a, latex beads coated with mce2a are not internalized by hela cells  <cit> . in the present study we have demonstrated that recombinant e. coli expressing mce4a protein can enter non-phagocytic hela cells. further, mce4a protein also enables the recombinant e. coli to survive inside thp- <dig> macrophages. the estimation of cfu demonstrates that the rate of intracellular survival of recombinant e. coli expressing mce4a was comparable to that of mce1a indicating thereby that mce4a may have a role similar to mce1a in invasion and survival of m. tuberculosis inside the host cells.

molecular modeling studies using bioinformatics tools have shown that cell entry epitope is exposed on the surface of mce1a, mce3a and mce4a proteins but not on the mce2a protein  <cit> . this suggests that the cell entry epitope of mce1a, mce3a and mce4a, but not of mce2a, may be available for interaction with mammalian cells. subsequently a report appeared confirming the role of mce3a and mce3e in mammalian cell entry  <cit> .

the recently emerging reports on the role of mce <dig> operon in survival of m. tuberculosis in host tissue indicates that mce <dig> proteins may be involved in maintaining the m. tuberculosis in a nutrient deficient environment for long term survival  <cit> . it has been suggested that the proteins of the mce <dig> operon may operate as a major cholesterol import system of m. tuberculosis because strains lacking mce <dig> operon exhibit drastically reduced ability to take up and metabolize cholesterol in vitro and hence grow poorly when cholesterol is the primary source of carbon  <cit> . it was reported earlier that mutation in mce <dig> operon produces growth defect in early phase of infection in mice and mutation in mce <dig> operon produces growth defect after 3– <dig> weeks post infection, indicating thereby that mce <dig> operon is required in later phase of infection  <cit> .

the localization study showed that the mce4a protein was present in the cell wall fraction of the stationary phase culture of m. tuberculosis h37rv further strengthening our results of transmission electron microscopy and cell invasion studies.

we conclude that the results of the present study strongly support the role of mce4a protein in invasion and the intracellular survival of m. tuberculosis and suggest that it may have a role in persistence of mycobacterial infection in the host tissue.

CONCLUSIONS
there are many studies reported in the literature to elucidate dormancy in m. tuberculosis and the survival mechanism of dormant tubercle bacilli is not fully understood. it is suggested that mycobacterial persistence might arise as a response to environmental stress, such as reduced oxygen concentration within host tissue. our earlier observation of preferential expression of mce <dig> operon in the internal organs of rabbit and guinea pig and also during the stationary phase in culture in conjunction with the results presented here strongly support a role for mce4a protein in the long term survival of m. tuberculosis inside its host.
