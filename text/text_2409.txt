BACKGROUND
the area planted with forage crops in the tropics extends for hundreds of millions of hectares. in brazil alone, the forage cropped land exceeds  <dig> m ha  <cit> , where four brachiaria species  cover 85% of the cultivated pastures  <cit> . only a few apomictic brachiaria clones occupy tens of millions of hectares in the country  <cit> , what represents a high risk of genetic vulnerability for forage production. this risk could be reduced with the increased use of genetic diversity conserved in germplasm banks in order to generate recombinant genotypes in breeding programs. the development and adoption of new brachiaria cultivars with a broad genetic base is crucial for the diversification of forage pasture in the tropics. the development of new cultivars must be a dynamic process, providing the pasture production sector with increasing genetic diversity.

among the four brachiaria species most cultivated in brazil, ruzigrass  stands out as a diploid species with sexual reproduction. polyploid brachiaria species such as b. brizantha, b. decumbens and b. humidicola typically present apomictic reproduction, a disadvantage for breeding programs that rely on sexual crosses and recombination for superior genotype selection. ruzigrass has good forage quality, fast growth in the beginning of the rainy season and is readily adaptable to forest-crop-livestock integration systems, not only for animal feeding  but also as soil coverage for no-till farming. after tetraploidization, ruzigrass plants can be crossed with other brachiaria species, making the inter-specific introgression of genes possible. seed production is uniform, since flowering occurs only once a year. this favors a decrease in seed production costs and an increase in seed quality. the elimination of the seed shattering trait is an essential move in enabling full domestication of b. ruziziensis, and will contribute to production of high quality seeds, turning b. ruziziensis into an essentially agricultural crop.

ruzigrass has a relatively small genome , similar to other model cereal species, such as rice  and sorghum . this enables genome analysis initiatives and the development of molecular tools to support breeding programs. in contrast, tetraploid brachiaria species  have larger and more complex genomes . therefore, ruzigrass has great potential to be used in breeding programs for pasture diversification, especially in combination with genomic tools aiding the selection of superior genotypes.

the employment of these genomic tools would favor a more dynamic development of new cultivars for this species. however, there is a lack of information about the b. ruziziensis genome. little or nothing is known about the number of genes, distribution of gene families, abundance and diversity of retro-elements, qtl localization of traits of economic importance, genome collinearity with model species, or abundance of repetitive sequences. genomic tools, such as molecular markers , to support breeding programs are simply not available.

traditional methods for the identification of microsatellite markers usually demand the construction of small-insert genomic libraries, colony selection by microsatellite-containing probe hybridization, sequencing of selected clones, primer design for suitable flanking regions, and assessments on the marker polymorphism by pcr analysis on a germplam sample. later on, methods employing microsatellite-enriched genomic libraries diminished costs, time and workload necessary for marker development  <cit> .

more recently, research groups have been applying next-generation sequencing technologies to generate sequence data for the genome identification of microsatellite regions and primer design  <cit> . for this purpose, both genomic dna and genic regions  have been used as templates for sequencing. the impact of this approach on microsatellite maker development is evident: partial genomic surveys using even fractions of a lane on next-generation sequencing machines allow the discovery of thousands of potentially amplifiable microsatellite regions which can be selected for primer design  <cit> . this is a promising approach for species with limited genomic information, whose breeding programs would greatly benefit from the use of genomic tools.

in brachiaria, marker development initiatives so far used microsatellite enriched libraries to obtain ssrs for the species b. brizantha <cit>  and b. humidicola <cit> . in summary, around  <dig> markers were polymorphic in b. brizantha, and  <dig> in b. humidicola. these authors tested the transferability of these markers to other brachiaria species, and the rates of successful amplifications varied with the target species. at least  <dig> out of the  <dig> markers developed from b. brizantha produced amplified pcr products in b. ruziziensis dna. similarly, pcr products were observed on  <dig> out of  <dig> microsatellites developed from b. humidicola, when these were tested on b. ruziziensis dna. no information on descriptive statistics such as polymorphic information content , allelic variation or heterozygosity estimates has been provided for these markers when tested on ruzigrass accessions.

in this study, we present a first set of  <dig> ssr markers developed for brachiaria ruziziensis, selected from a de novo partial genome assembly of single-end illumina reads. descriptive statistics for  <dig> of these markers are provided. a set of  <dig> multiplex panels for the simultaneous amplification of the  <dig> most informative markers  is made available. these markers will be readily useful for the b. ruziziensis breeding program, aiding in areas such as germplasm characterization, construction of linkage and qtl maps, gene flow and mating system evaluation, and marker assisted selection.

RESULTS
number of ssr loci initially detected in the ruzigrass genome
we restricted our search for microsatellite-containing regions to perfect di- tri- and tetranucleotide motifs only. after partial de novo genome assembly, a total of  <dig>  perfect microsatellite loci were detected . in order to select loci for subsequent primer design, we looked for perfect microsatellites in contigs > <dig> pb with a minimum 10x coverage. this reduced the number of regions to  <dig> .


most frequent motif types and repeat numbers
tri-nucleotide repeats were the most abundant class of microsatellites  detected in the partially assembled ruzigrass genome, followed by tetra-nucleotide  and di-nucleotide repeats  . ag, ccg, and aaat were the most frequent types of microsatellite sequences detected on each class . the most frequent tri-nucleotide repeat motif  was particularly the most abundant one, comprising  <dig> % of the perfect microsatellite regions detected on contigs with at least 10x coverage. di- and tetra-nucleotide repeat motifs, on the other hand, had a more balanced distribution among different classes. the average number of repeats was three for tri- and tetra-nucleotides, and six for di-nucleotides.


synthesized primer pairs
a total of  <dig>  perfect microsatellite loci were detected in contigs with a minimum 100x coverage. we selected  <dig> loci at random for primer design and synthesis, which were given the “brz” prefix. additional file 1: table s <dig> includes information regarding their forward and reverse primer sequences, their melting temperatures, repeat motifs, and expected product sizes. a subset of these loci was labeled with fluorescent dyes and multiplexed in order to test their efficiency on genotyping ruzigrass accessions. we tested  <dig> multiplex panels containing  <dig> primer pairs . successful genotyping of  <dig> of these loci was achieved, while the remaining  <dig> loci presented either difficult interpretation of genotyping data, or absence of amplified products. however, no pcr optimization attempts were made for these loci. this represents a minimum  <dig> % success rate of pcr amplification in unoptimized conditions for microsatellite loci generated from this partial de novo genome assembly. among those  <dig> markers presenting coherent, interpretable amplified products,  <dig>  markers were polymorphic when tested on  <dig> diverse african-derived ruzigrass accessions. if we consider the loss of microsatellite markers in the whole process, at least  <dig> % of the  <dig> tested loci represent polymorphic, informative markers which can be readily applied to ruzigrass germplasm characterization and breeding. figure  <dig> shows an example of electropherogram for one of the tested panels on three ruzigrass accessions.


descriptive statistics for each ssr marker
genotyping of  <dig> ruzigrass accessions with these  <dig> markers detected  <dig> alleles. the initial database of allele frequencies in brachiaria ruziziensis shows  <dig> % of rare alleles ,  <dig> % of intermediate alleles  and  <dig> % of abundant alleles . additional file 2: table s <dig> presents the descriptive statistics information regarding these polymorphic markers.

the number of observed alleles for all polymorphic ssr markers ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  with an average value of  <dig>  alleles per locus. their expected heterozygosity  values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with an average of  <dig> . observed heterozygosity  values ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig> . the polymorphism information content  values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with an average of  <dig> .

expected product sizes for each microsatellite marker are based on sequence information generated by the de novo assembly process. we checked whether the size ranges for the polymorphic loci included their expected product size. this was true for  <dig> % of the loci . the proportion of markers that generated amplicons within 10% of their expected sizes was  <dig> % . no markers presented amplicons 90% larger or smaller than expected.

we ranked the  <dig> most informative markers regarding their pic values and assembled them into  <dig> multiplex panels for fast ruzigrass genotyping. the average pic value for the  <dig> markers was  <dig> , varying from  <dig>  to  <dig> . table  <dig> shows these panels and markers and their respective primer sequences and descriptive statististics.


transferability to other brachiaria species
a survey on the potential transferability of microsatellite markers generated for ruzigrass to other brachiaria species showed that  <dig> % of the  <dig> polymorphic markers presented amplified pcr products on brachiaria brizantha cv. marandu,  <dig> % on b. brizantha cv. piatã, and  <dig> % on b. brizantha cv. xaraés. the percentage of potentially transferable markers to b. decumbens cv. basilisk was  <dig> %. finally, for brachiaria humidicola cv. tupi, only  <dig> % of  <dig> markers showed amplified pcr products.

discussion
a true revolution is taking place on our ability to identify and develop microsatellite markers either for breeding, germplasm characterization, or conservation. the steady decrease in costs for obtaining next-generation sequencing data has made possible for research groups with access to an ngs facility to put a new model of microsatellite development to the test.

most of the first published papers reporting the use of next-generation sequencing technologies for the development of microsatellite markers used either shotgun pyrosequencing of genomic dna  <cit> , or of enriched libraries  <cit> . illumina sequencing was first applied to transcriptome sequencing and assembly, followed by the detection of genic ssr markers  <cit> . castoe et al.  <cit>  tested the use of illumina paired-end reads of genomic dna, without enrichment or assembly of reads, to detect potentially amplifiable microsatellite loci on three different organisms. this approach was also used by o’bryhim et al.  <cit>  to develop microsatellite markers on an endangered scaleshell species. castoe’s work does not present any data on the test of synthesized primer pairs. o’bryhim’s paper reports the test of  <dig> primer pairs,  <dig> of which were polymorphic.

we show that reads from an illumina single-end run, when assembled de novo with high levels of stringency, are also suitable for the identification of microsatellite regions. even though we haven’t tested castoe’s scripts to detect potentially amplifiable loci from unassembled reads, we believe the assembly process adds a consistent level of sequence quality. that increases the chance of finding good-quality flanking regions for which primer pairs can be designed.

squirrel et al.  <cit>  used the term “attrition rate” to describe the loss of loci at each step of microsatellite marker development. for traditional projects - which include the construction of clone libraries, the sequencing of clones, microsatellite identification, primer design, and pcr - their estimate based on a review of published papers showed that, on average, 83% of the sequenced clones would be lost due to problems in different steps of the development process.

the application of this criterion to measure how much effort is necessary to develop functional, polymorphic microsatellite markers using genome surveys based on next-generation sequencing depends on the definition of what initial count is used. in our case, depending on the imposed stringency on contig coverage, our initial number of potentially useful, perfect microsatellite markers ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  , and finally to  <dig>  . if we chose the most stringent parameter, we would expect that from our  <dig>  microsatellite-containing sequences,  <dig> would be suitable for primer synthesis , and  <dig> would be polymorphic . if we only consider that final step, the expected number of functional polymorphic markers from our set of tested primer pairs would be  <dig> . our observed number of polymorphic markers was higher,  <dig> of our  <dig> tested primer pairs were polymorphic .

we could apply the attrition rate estimates published by squirrel et al. to answer one more question: given our final set of functional polymorphic microsatellite loci, how much effort would be necessary in previous steps of marker development if we were using a traditional clone library approach? the answer is that in order to obtain  <dig> functional polymorphic loci,  <dig>  clones from an enriched library would have to be sequenced,  <dig> microsatellites would have to be identified, and  <dig> primer pairs would have to be synthesized and tested.

it is obvious that when comparing these estimates, factors such as the abundance of microsatellite regions on the genome of interest are taken for granted. for practical purposes, a more useful comparison would be that between a clone library sequencing method and a next-generation sequencing method on the same organism. in this case, not only the final number of useful markers would be considered, but also costs, time and laboratory workload. santana et al.  <cit>  have done that for the fungus fusarium circinatum, a pine pathogen. while a single  <dig> run using pooled issr-pcr products detected  <dig> potentially amplifiable microsatellites , sanger sequencing of  <dig> clones containing issr-pcr fragments allowed the detection of  <dig> potentially amplifiable sequences.

we can compare our effort with previous microsatellite development initiatives for other brachiaria species. in b. brizantha <cit> ,  <dig> clones from an enriched library were sequenced,  <dig> primer pairs were designed and tested, and  <dig> of those were polymorphic. a new set of  <dig> polymorphic primers for this species was published by vigna et al.  <cit> , using the same enriched library. for b. humidicola,  <dig> clones were sequenced,  <dig> primer pairs were tested, and  <dig> were polymorphic  <cit> . a new set of  <dig> primer pairs was tested by vigna et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> of which were polymorphic. no microsatellite markers had been developed so far for brachiaria ruziziensis.

it seems, therefore, that the detection and development of microsatellite markers from genome assembled illumina single-end dna sequences is highly efficient. this approach should be especially considered for species with limited genomic information.

the need for further germplasm collection expeditions to increase the genetic diversity of b. ruziziensis kept in germplasm banks should also be mentioned. it was observed that roughly 30% of the expected allele sizes were not detected on the  <dig> ruzigrass accessions genotyped in this study. since the plant used to generate the single-end sequences is derived from a self-pollinated plant collected in the field in brazil, this data indicates that there is genetic variation in ruzigrass that is out of the allele variation boundaries observed in the analyis of the  <dig> african-derived genotypes used in this experiment. it is possible that new germplasm collection initiatives in pastures established in the 1960-1970’s in brazil will identify accessions with useful genetic diversity for ruzigrass breeding programs.

finally, although we consider the data on transferability of ruzigrass microsatellite markers to other brachiaria species rather preliminary, the higher proportion of successful pcr amplifications on b. brizantha and b. decumbens cultivars indicates a closer phylogenetic distance between these species and b. ruziziensis, when compared with b. humidicola.

CONCLUSIONS
we show that the detection and development of microsatellite markers from genome assembled illumina single-end dna sequences is highly efficient. the developed markers are readily suitable for genetic analysis and marker assisted selection of brachiaria ruziziensis. the use of this approach for microsatellite marker development is promising for species with limited genomic information, whose breeding programs would benefit from the use of genomic tools. to our knowledge, this is the first set of microsatellite markers developed for this important species.
