BACKGROUND

vibrio cholerae is a gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium that is naturally ubiquitous in coastal, estuarine, and riverine waters in planktonic form and within biofilms associated with abiotic and biological materials  <cit> . toxin-producing strains of v. cholerae cause the serious diarrheal disease cholera. epidemic strains undergo a reversible phase variation event between smooth and rugose colonial morphotypes at a frequency apparently greater than that of non-epidemic clinical and environmental strains  <cit> . rugose cells form highly corrugated colonies and more structurally complex biofilms due to excess production of vibrio polysaccharide . vps is a viscous biopolymer partly composed of structural matrix proteins and a polysaccharide  containing glucose, galactose and an amide between 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-guluronic acid and glycine . the biofilm proficient rugose phase facilitates nutrient acquisition from insubstantial sources such as drinking water reservoirs, enhances resistance to chlorine and a variety of environmental stresses  and provides greater resistance to complement-mediated serum lysis  <cit> . consequently, rugosity is considered a survival adaptation that enhances the overall fitness of v. cholerae in aquatic habitats and may additionally contribute to the pathogenesis of the organism  <cit> .

the genes responsible for assembly and transport of vps-ps are distributed across two closely positioned loci, vpsi and vpsii, which are situated within an approximately  <dig>  kb region on the larger of the two chromosomes of v. cholerae  <cit> . most of the vps gene products play various biosynthetic and functional roles in the formation of vps-ps, while several others are hypothetical proteins of unknown function  <cit> . characterization of non-polar vps deletion mutants revealed that most of the vps genes are required for the production of corrugated colonies, pellicles, and biofilms  <cit> . the two vps gene clusters are separated by an intergenic region that contains the rbm genes, which encode biofilm matrix proteins unique to v. cholerae  <cit> . bap <dig>  encoded by the unlinked vc <dig> gene, is a homolog of one of the rbm proteins and is also required for v. cholerae biofilm stability  <cit> .

regulation of vps production in v. cholerae is quite complex. it is positively controlled by the transcriptional regulators vpsr and vpst, which are both required for corrugated colony and biofilm formation  <cit> . vpsr is a stronger regulator of the vps genes than is vpst and acts together with the alternative sigma factor rpon. vps production and biofilm formation are favored by increasing concentrations of the second messenger molecule, c-di-gmp  <cit> , which is synthesized by ggdef-domain diguanylate cyclases  and degraded by eal- or hd-gyp-domain phosphodiesterases . the expression of vps genes is negatively regulated by quorum sensing through the master regulator hapr . some strains of v. cholerae, including pandemic o <dig> el tor strain n <dig>  contain natural nonsense mutations in their hapr genes  <cit> . while it was once thought that hapr mutant strains were unable to regulate gene expression in response to changes in bacterial populations, more recent studies have demonstrated that even in the absence of a functional hapr gene, other quorum sensing components are able to circumvent the normal hapr-dependent pathway to regulate gene expression  <cit> .

a microarray analysis completed by yildiz et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> differentially regulated genes between smooth and rugose phase variants of the v. cholerae o <dig> el tor a <dig> strain. biofilm-related genes, including vps and rbm, as well as genes coding for activated sugar nucleotide intermediates, secreted proteins, and putative chitinases, were found to be up-regulated in rugose phase variants. among the genes that were down-regulated in rugose as compared to smooth were flagellar motility and several chemotaxis-related genes.

rna-seq technology has recently been used to detect genome-wide transcriptional regulation in v. cholerae and has also been used in combination with chip-seq to effectively resolve certain regulons . here we used rna-seq to obtain a comprehensive overview of the whole genome expression changes that occur between smooth and rugose colonial phase variants of v. cholerae n <dig>  because phase variation can be a reversible process, we included a set of smooth phase variants that were directly derived from rugose isolates in addition to the original smooth parental variants in our analysis. our results implicate specific metabolic changes, including production and utilization of acetate and anaerobic respiration, which were not previously linked to colonial phase transitions in v. cholerae. phenotypic and transcriptomic characterization of the smooth variants derived from rugose revealed them to be distinct from the original smooth parent in that they were deficient in biofilm formation despite having vps and rbm transcripts at elevated levels reminiscent of the rugose isolates. moreover, we found similar shared transcriptomic signatures between the rugose and their smooth derivatives for genes related to acetate and peptide metabolism, as well as some that encode for regulatory functions and chemotaxis proteins.

RESULTS
isolation and phenotypic characterization of colonial phase variants
starting with three well-isolated smooth colonies of the parental strain n <dig>  independent broth cultures were passaged daily with occasional plating for individual colonies. rugose  variants were eventually identified, and a single representative was randomly chosen from each passaging experiment for further study . similar daily passaging and occasional plating beginning with strains ru <dig>  ru <dig>  and ru <dig> eventually yielded smooth derivative  isolates, and single randomly chosen representatives were again selected . multiple independent quantitative switching assays  beginning with each of the n16961r variants yielded smooth colonies at frequencies ranging from  <dig>  ±  <dig> % to as much as  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the total colonies counted and phenotypically scored for a given assay. such high frequency switching was similar to that observed for the initial conversion of n <dig> to n16961r  and thus was consistent with a reversible phase variation event. previously, yildiz and schoolnik  <cit>  reported reversible switching between smooth and rugose forms of v. cholerae strain a <dig> at frequencies comparable to ours.fig.  <dig> experimental procedure for isolation of n16961-derived phase variants. a beginning with isolated colonies, parental strain n <dig> was subjected to daily passaging with plating following the indicated approximate number of bacterial generations. single randomly selected rugose isolates, designated ru <dig>  ru <dig> and ru <dig>  were then chosen. in the passaging experiment where ru <dig> was eventually selected, plating was also performed after ~ <dig> generations, but there were no clearly distinguishable rugose isolates present on those plates; b beginning with isolated colonies of ru <dig>  ru <dig>  and ru <dig>  the passaging and plating procedure was repeated, and single randomly chosen smooth isolates, designated sd <dig>  sd <dig> and sd <dig>  were selected at the end




growth curves of n <dig>  n16961r and n16961sd isolates revealed that n <dig> and n16961sd strains all had doubling times of approximately 25 min during exponential phase growth, while n16961r strains grew somewhat slower with a doubling time of approximately 30 min . we also examined phase variants for biofilm formation and motility, two attributes that have been used previously to distinguish smooth and rugose forms of v. cholerae. in biofilm tube assays, the quantity of biofilm material produced by n16961r variants was trending towards a significant difference from that produced by the n <dig> parent according to statistical analysis with tukey’s post-test  . inspection of pellicles produced by n <dig> and n16961r samples revealed differences in biofilm architecture  in that pellicles formed by n <dig> appeared smooth at the surface and were easily disrupted with agitation, while pellicles formed by all three of the n16961r variants appeared wrinkled and were not easily disrupted by vortexing. meanwhile, n16961sd variants did not produce obvious biofilms  and, in fact, samples within the n16961sd group were not statistically different from the uninoculated controls . in motility assays, both n16961r and n16961sd variants were significantly less motile than n <dig>  .fig.  <dig> biofilm formation of n <dig> phase variants. a following 48 h of static incubation at 30 °c, liquid cultures were poured off and the remaining attached biofilm material was stained with  <dig> % crystal violet and quantified by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm. represented in the graph are the average absorbance values of  <dig> replicates of n <dig>   <dig> replicates  of n16961r,  <dig> replicates  of n16961sd, and  <dig> replicates of the uninoculated control. error bars show standard deviations. samples indicated with the same letter were not significantly different according to tukey’s post-test . b following 48 h of static incubation at 30 °c, liquid cultures were carefully poured out and the pellicles that had formed at the air-broth interface during incubation were retained and repositioned at the side of each glass tube to be photographed

principal component analysis of rna-seq data
total rna was isolated from nine mid-exponential cultures of n <dig>  n16961r and n16961sd phase variants . the rna was depleted of dna and rrna and constructed into strand-specific barcoded cdna libraries, which were then sequenced on a single flowcell of an illumina hiseq <dig> to give  <dig> , <dig> total reads, each of  <dig> nucleotides in length. individual samples ranged from approximately  <dig> to  <dig> million reads. the short reads generated for this project were deposited at the ncbi sra database under accession number prjna <dig>  for each sample, greater than 99% of the high quality reads were mapped to the reference v. cholerae n <dig> genome reported by heidelberg et al.  <cit>  . reads that did not exclusively map well within the confines of individual predicted gene models were excluded from further analysis. the remaining read counts normalized in fragments per kilobase per million reads  for each sample with regard to gene models identified in the reference genome are given in additional file 3: table s <dig> 

these reads were then clustered in a principal component analysis , which confirmed the three n <dig>  n16961r or n16961sd transcriptomes were more similar to one another than they were to those of the other phase variant groups . the ru <dig> sample was separated by pca from the other two samples within the n16961r phase variant group. although ru <dig> was distinct from the other two n16961r isolates, the expression profile of sd <dig>  the smooth derivative that was isolated from ru <dig>  was very similar to the expression profiles of the other two n16961sd isolates. indeed, the n16961sd samples were the most clustered grouping in the pca analysis, sharing even more transcriptomic similarities than the n <dig> parental group. principal component  <dig>  separated the parental and the n16961sd group, both of which share the smooth colonial phenotype, from the rugose variants. the parental group and n16961sd group, however, were different in motility and capacity to form biofilms , and their transcriptomes were separated based on principal component  <dig> . this result also implies that the n16961sd phase variants did not arise from an exact reversal of the adjustments in gene expression that occurred concomitantly with the initial smooth-to-rugose switch, a conclusion that is supported by subsequent analysis of the rna-seq data as detailed below.fig.  <dig> principal component analysis. the principal components  identified together account for  <dig> % of the overall variability of the dataset. phase variants were grouped by pca based on transcriptomic similarities




patterns and functional categories of differential gene expression identified by rna-seq analysis
differential expression analysis of the normalized rna-seq data was performed using deseq  <cit> , which identifies differentially expressed genes using a negative binomial distribution model and corrects for false discovery rate at 5% by generating p
adj values using the benjamini and hochberg method  <cit> . results of the three pairwise comparisons, i.e., the parents  versus the rugose variants , n16961r versus the smooth derivatives , and n <dig> versus n16961sd, are given in additional file 7: table s3; additional file 8: table s4; additional file 9: table s <dig>  there were  <dig> genes significantly differentially expressed  between n <dig> and n16961r, with  <dig> of them being up-regulated and  <dig> being down-regulated. the majority of these genes were not previously described by yildiz et al.  <cit> , which may be the result of multiple factors, including the increased resolution of rna-seq compared to microarray analysis and the different strains examined. in comparison to our observed expression changes between n <dig> and n16961r, more significant differences were observed here between n16961r and n16961sd phases, with  <dig> genes differentially expressed, of which  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated. the majority of significantly differentially expressed genes were clustered into co-expression groups, and functions represented in each group were identified based on the sequenced v. cholerae n <dig> genome annotation  <cit> . the five gene expression patterns observed were: i) up-regulated in the transition from n <dig> to n16961r and remaining up-regulated in the transition from n16961r to n16961sd ; ii) up-regulated from n <dig> to n16961r and down-regulated in n16961r to n16961sd ; iii) down-regulated from n <dig> to n16961r and up-regulated in n16961r to n16961sd ; iv) not significantly regulated from n <dig> to n16961r and then down-regulated in n16961sd ; v) not significantly regulated from n <dig> to n16961r and then up-regulated in n16961sd . for the differentially regulated genes identified here, we will focus our results and discussion on functional categories of genes that were also previously described by yildiz et al.  <cit> , as well as those newly described functions that we postulate may contribute either positively or negatively to biofilm development and associated phenotypic changes .

sugar transport and utilization
genes encoding components of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system , including vca <dig> , which encodes a sucrose-specific pts component and vc <dig>  which encodes a putative fructose-specific pts component, were both down-regulated at least  <dig> fold on the n <dig> to n16961r switch and then up-regulated in the n16961r to n16961sd switch . yildiz et al.  <cit>  also observed a reduced expression of fructose-specific pts components in their rugose isolate. the pts is a phosphotransfer cascade that transports and phosphorylates specific carbohydrates, such as glucose, sucrose, fructose, mannose, and n-acetylglucosamine, into the cell  <cit> . the phosphorylation state of certain pts components acts as a signal of environmental carbohydrate availability and these reversible phosphorylation signals influence the activation or inactivation of other cellular processes including biofilm formation  <cit> . our findings here appear to be consistent with previous results where fructose and sucrose were found to inhibit the formation of rugose colonies of v. cholerae  <cit> . similar regulation of certain pts sugar utilization genes was also observed here, including vca <dig>  which encodes a sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase that is required for utilization of sucrose as a sole carbon source, and vc <dig> , which is involved in mannose catabolism .

vps production and biofilm formation
fifteen of the  <dig> vps and rbm genes were significantly up-regulated following the transition from n <dig> to n16961r with fold changes ranging from approximately  <dig> to nearly  <dig> . these genes were not significantly down-regulated from n16961r to n16961sd, and  <dig> of the  <dig> genes remained significantly up-regulated in n16961sd when compared with the n <dig> transcriptome . in contrast to yildiz et al.  <cit> , we did not detect differential regulation of the vpsu, vpsc, vpsg, vpsk, rbme, vpsn, vpsp, and vpsq genes, while, neither study showed evidence of differential expression of the rbmf gene. normalized rna expression profiles of the vpsi, vpsii and rbm clusters for each of the phase variants were visualized  in parallel tracks using integrative genomics viewer  <cit> . rna peaks showed very similar qualitative expression patterns for all three clusters in the n16961r and n16961sd samples further supporting the consistent expression patterns observed within biological replicates.fig.  <dig> transcription analysis of vps and rbm genes among n <dig> phase variants. a normalized rna expression profiles based on rna-seq results for biofilm-related genes. peaks corresponding to the number of transcripts that mapped to regions containing the vpsi, vpsii, and rbm gene clusters are shown in parallel tracks for each phase variant. n <dig> samples are depicted in green, n16961r samples are shown in red, and n16961sd samples are shown in blue. although our analysis reported similar up-regulated expression values of the genes of all three clusters in the n16961r and n16961sd samples as compared to n <dig>  some genes of the vpsi cluster fell out of the range of statistical significance in the n16961sd samples . these include the vpsi gene, which encodes a glycosyltransferase, the vpse and vpsh genes, whose products are predicted to be involved vps export, and the vpsf and vpsj genes, which encode proteins of unknown function. the increased p
adj values obtained for these genes may be a result of the apparent differences in expression of the vpsi cluster in the sd <dig> sample versus sd <dig> and sd <dig>  which can be seen in the figure. b rt-qpcr verification of up-regulation of genes representative of the vpsi, vpsii, and rbm gene clusters in n16961r and n16961sd samples. the graph depicts the log <dig> fold changes of gene transcripts calculated for each selected gene relative to their transcript abundances in the n <dig> sample group at a confidence interval of 95%. all data were normalized respective to the reference gene, gyra, and the error bars depict the normalized quantity standard error




to confirm these rna-seq results, particularly the unexpected up-regulation of a number of vps and rbm genes in the biofilm-defective n16961sd variants, we also performed rt-qpcr on representative differentially regulated genes of the vpsi, vpsii and rbm clusters. consistent with the rna-seq analysis, significantly higher levels of the vpsa, vpsl and rbmc transcripts were observed in the n16961r and n16961sd samples relative to n <dig> . furthermore, there was consistency between the rna-seq and rt-qpcr analyses regarding the order of magnitude of induction  and with the fact that for each method a given gene’s induction levels in n16961r and n16961sd relative to n <dig> were similar. rt-qpcr was performed initially by using aliquots of rna from the original samples used for rna-seq. when the rt-qpcr was repeated using freshly prepared independent rna from the nine isolates, nearly identical results were obtained .

the vps and rbm genes are known to be positively regulated at the transcriptional level by the action of vpsr and the alternative sigma factor rpon  <cit> . indeed, vc <dig>  which encodes the rpon-dependent vpsr protein, was up-regulated greater than 10-fold from n <dig> to n16961r and remained up-regulated in n16961sd isolates . another transcriptional regulator, cdga, which is positively regulated by vpsr and functions as a diguanylate cyclase to increase c-di-gmp levels and increase transcription of the vps and rbm genes  <cit> , was also up-regulated greater than 5-fold from n <dig> to n16961r and its expression then did not significantly change upon transition to n16961sd .

the vc <dig> gene encoding a homologue of rbmc, bap <dig>  which is required for biofilm integrity  <cit> , was also found to be up-regulated in the n <dig> to n16961r switch and remained up-regulated in the n16961sd samples . the elevated vps and rbm transcript levels in the n16961sd isolates raise the possibility that post-transcriptional, or perhaps post-translational, regulation of one or more of these genes or their gene products has occurred, and that such regulation may be the basis for the biofilm-defective phenotype of this phase variant. interestingly, negative regulation of rbmc transcript translation was recently shown to result from binding of a srna  <cit> .

acetate production and utilization and central metabolism
the vc <dig>  gene, which encodes acetyl-coenzyme a synthetase , was found to be up-regulated approximately 4-fold upon the switch from n <dig> to n16961r . the acs protein is part of a high affinity bacterial pathway used to scavenge  acetate from the environment. in e. coli, such assimilation has been shown to occur just as cells transition to a slower growth phase . prior to this event, acetate is excreted  during exponential growth; thus, this represents a change in acetate production and usage with induction of acs transcription being part of the mechanism that flips the switch  <cit> . the implication from the rna-seq data for vc <dig> is that a switch to acetate assimilation is associated with rugosity in v. cholerae, at least under the growth conditions used in our study.

while acs catalyzes the formation of acetyl-coa from acetate during assimilation, the reverse pathway  is achieved during dissimilation by the sequential action of phosphate acetyltransferase  and acetate kinase  enzymes, which in v. cholerae are encoded by the vc <dig> and vc <dig> genes, respectively. interestingly, while transcription of the acs gene was not significantly different between n16961r and n16961sd isolates , transcript abundance of both the vc <dig> and vc <dig> genes was increased by nearly 3-fold in the smooth derivative compared to rugose . moreover, two genes, vc <dig>  and vc <dig> , encoding components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex that converts pyruvate to acetyl-coa, were also up-regulated approximately 3-fold in the n16961sd variants . these data raise the possibility that a switch back to acetate production and excretion is associated with the smooth derivative.

as shown in e. coli, utilization of acetate for growth necessarily involves the glyoxylate bypass  and gluconeogenesis  <cit> . the expression of the malate synthase gene vc <dig> , whose product is a critical enzyme controlling metabolic flux specifically through the gb, was induced approximately 6-fold from n <dig> to n16961r and then down-regulated nearly the same amount in n16961sd . also, the gene for 2-methylcitrate synthase, vc <dig> , which functions in both the tca cycle and gb, was similarly regulated . other tca/gb genes, including vc <dig> , vc <dig> , vc <dig>  and vc <dig> , or tca only genes vc <dig>  and vc <dig> , were not significantly changed from n <dig> to n16961r but then were all reduced by 3-fold or greater in n16961sd . meanwhile, genes involved in gluconeogenesis, including vca <dig> , vc <dig> , and vc <dig> , were not significantly regulated between n <dig> and n16961r but were then all down-regulated 2-fold or greater in n16961sd . overall, our data provide evidence of induction of gb in n16961r with reduction of this pathway , along with gluconeogenesis, in n16961sd. it is tempting to speculate that for the rugose isolates here the combination of acetate assimilation, gb, and gluconeogenesis resulted in conversion of acetate to glucose, which is a component of vps-ps  <cit> ; thus, these metabolic pathways may play significant roles in biofilm formation in this species. interestingly, besides its potential role in biofilm formation, acetate assimilation in v. cholerae also appears to affect the cholera disease process itself by altering host insulin signaling and metabolism of lipids  <cit> .

anaerobic respiration and growth
genes involved in anaerobic respiration including vc <dig> and vc <dig>  which code for proteins with putative formate dehydrogenase activity, and vc <dig>  which encodes an iron-sulfur protein, were up-regulated approximately 4-5-fold in the switch from n <dig> to n16961r, and this up-regulation was reversed upon the switch from n16961r to n16961sd . other predicted anaerobic respiration or fermentation genes were not significantly regulated from n <dig> to n16961r but then were down-regulated in n16961sd derivatives. these included vca <dig> , which encodes a periplasmic nitrate reductase, vc <dig> , encoding fumarate reductase, and vca <dig> , encoding lactate dehydrogenase . in the case of the latter function, it is possible that down-regulation of lactate production in n16961sd allows for more pyruvate to be available for putative acetate fermentation. other genes whose products are predicted to function under anaerobic conditions were also down-regulated in n16961sd variants, including vca <dig> , encoding a ribonucleoside triphosphate, vca <dig> , encoding a c4-dicarboxylate transporter, vc <dig> , encoding an aldo/keto reductase, and vc <dig> , encoding a trimethylamine-n-oxide reductase . the results for genes in this category implicate a role for oxygen limitation/anaerobiosis in rugosity and potentially biofilm formation in v. cholerae. a role for oxygen deprivation in biofilm development in this organism was also postulated based on proteomic studies performed for cells grown under differing oxygen conditions  <cit> .

motility and chemotaxis
in contrast to our current findings, yildiz et al.  <cit>  reported that expression of some class iii and iv flagellar genes was reduced in the strain a <dig> rugose variant, whose motility was shown to be reduced by about 50%; however, the significance of this finding was unclear since swimming behavior and flagella production seemed unaffected compared to the a <dig> smooth parent. we found that while motility of n16961r was significantly reduced relative to n <dig> by over 3-fold , there was no concomitant down-regulation of flagellar genes. we did observe down-regulation of some class i and class ii flagellar genes ranging from fold changes of approximately 2– <dig> in the switch from n16961r to n16961sd . the significance of this regulation is similarly unclear since motility appeared to be unchanged between these two types of variants.

the previous microarray analysis also identified several differentially regulated chemotaxis genes  <cit> . one of those identified previously as being up-regulated in rugose, vca <dig>  was also up-regulated over 19-fold in n16961r and remained up-regulated in n16961sd  in our study. the gene for another methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein  was also up-regulated by nearly 6-fold in n16961r but was then down-regulated by the same amount in n16961sd . additionally, some genes encoding chemotaxis-related functions were unchanged in the initial transition but then were down-regulated in the n16961sd samples, including the methyl accepting chemotaxis proteins encoded by the vc <dig>  vc <dig>  vc <dig>  vca <dig>  and vca <dig> genes .

additional regulatory functions
the putative c-di-gmp synthetase gene, vc <dig>  was up-regulated over 6-fold in n16961r and then down-regulated  <dig> -fold in n16961sd . expression of a putative c-di-gmp synthetase with an extracellular solute binding domain encoded by the vca <dig> gene was unchanged in n16961r compared to n <dig> but was then decreased by nearly 3-fold in n16961sd . the vca <dig> gene, which also encodes a protein with predicted c-di-gmp synthetase and phosphodiesterase activity was found to be up-regulated over 10-fold in both the n16961r and n16961sd variants as compared to n <dig> . as corrugated colony formation, vps synthesis, and biofilm formation have all been previously reported to be controlled by intracellular c-di-gmp levels in v. cholerae, the differentially regulated genes related to c-di-gmp synthesis identified in our analysis are likely to be involved in mediating phenotypic changes that occur with colonial phase variation in this organism.

the gene vc <dig>  which encodes a pas domain-containing sensor histidine kinase protein of a bacterial two component system, was up-regulated in n16961r , and it remained up-regulated in n16961sd . similarly, the vc <dig> gene, a putative response regulator cognate to the vc <dig> product was induced in n16961r and remained highly expressed in n16961sd . the presence of a hd-gyp domain in this response regulator suggests that it probably possesses pde activity, which would act to degrade c-di-gmp in response to particular environmental stimuli.

other genes encoding signal sensing proteins that were found to be down-regulated in n16961sd were vc <dig>  vc <dig>  and vc <dig>  encoding sensor kinase proteins, and the vc <dig> gene, which might be the cognate response regulator for vc <dig> . the vc <dig> gene contains both an eal phosphodiesterase domain and a cbs domain, with the latter being associated with adenosyl  binding.

peptide transport and utilization
the vc <dig>  gene encoding gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase , which was up-regulated in v. cholerae strain a <dig> rugose previously  <cit> , was found here to be 15-fold higher in n16961r than n <dig> and was then reduced approximately 4-fold from n16961r to n16961sd . ggt is required for the utilization of exogenous gamma-glutamyl peptides and facilitates de novo synthesis of cysteine and glycine, which is a component of vps-ps  <cit> ; thus, it is possible that ggt contributes significantly to vps-ps production in rugose v. cholerae. interestingly, ggt was reported to contribute to the environmental persistence of e. coli under growth-limiting conditions  <cit> , and it has also been implicated as a colonization factor of the bacterial pathogens helicobacter pylori and campylobacter jejuni  <cit> .

two oligopeptide permease components encoded by vc <dig>  and vc <dig>  were up-regulated about 5-fold in n16961r and were then down-regulated over 8-fold in the n16961sd variants . in addition to the role of peptide transport systems in cell nutrition, they have also been implicated in other processes such as chemotaxis, conjugation, virulence, and competence  <cit> . additionally, an oppa mutant of vibrio fluvialis was found to have increased biofilm formation when grown in media containing peptone or tryptone as a nitrogen source  <cit> .

stress response
some genes involved in stress response were up-regulated in the n16961sd derivatives . these genes include vc <dig>  and vc <dig> , which were both up-regulated approximately 3-fold, and, interestingly, were found to be differentially regulated in hapr mutants in the microarray study by yildiz et al.  <cit> . the protein products of these two genes act as chaperones to protect other proteins from damage during stressful conditions such as heat shock. additionally, the vca <dig>  gene was up-regulated more than  <dig> -fold. hmp is a nitric oxide dioxygenase, which uses o <dig> and nadph to convert nitric oxide into nitrate, conferring greater resistance to nitrosative stress. finally, the vc <dig>  gene was up-regulated  <dig> -fold. the rapa gene encodes an rna polymerase associated protein, which stimulates the recycling of rna polymerase during transcription in stressful conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
although phase variation in v. cholerae between smooth and rugose forms was known to be phenotypically reversible, smooth variants derived from rugose had not previously been analyzed in any detail. the n16961sd isolates are biofilm-deficient apparently due to an uncharacterized genetic or epigenetic change which still allows for elevated transcription of vps and rbm genes. given the differential regulation of multiple genes involved in acetate metabolism in the smooth derivatives, an intriguing epigenetic possibility which would link underlying metabolic changes with biofilm forming capability would involve post-translational inactivation via acetylation  of one or more components required for rugosity. regardless of the exact mechanism, however, it is apparent that although these smooth variants phenotypically resemble the n <dig> parent in colony morphology, they nevertheless share certain cryptic transcriptomic signatures with the rugose isolates, at least under the culture conditions used in our study.

a summary of the differentially regulated genes discussed here is presented in fig.  <dig>  besides the vps/rbm signature, other expression pathways that were up-regulated in n16961r and n16961sd relative to n <dig> included a putative two-component regulatory system , c-di-gmp synthesis  and chemotaxis , as well as the ggt gene, which has been implicated in the environmental persistence of several different bacterial species . taken together, our results suggest these transcriptomic signatures may represent a stress adaptive consequence which allows for a more rapid phenotypic response  when potentially changing environmental conditions dictate. additional characterization of n16961sd should further our understanding of the role of this variant in the ecology and pathogenesis of strain n <dig>  it would also be interesting to determine whether this phenotype arises in populations of other pandemic and non-pandemic v. cholerae strains. lastly, the differentially regulated genes identified here have provided additional insights into the multitude of underlying changes that occur with phase variation in this bacterial pathogen.fig.  <dig> overview of the differentially regulated genes discussed in this paper. the first symbol next to each gene name represents the qualitative expression change from n <dig> to n16961r, the second symbol denotes the change from n16961r to n16961sd and the third represents the difference from n <dig> to n16961sd. symbol types are as follows: a dash indicates no significant change in gene expression, an upward arrow indicates up-regulation of the gene, and a downward arrow indicates down-regulation of the gene. summary of central metabolic pathways shown within the cell includes the locations of gene functions as labeled with numbers. pathways or portions of a pathway are colored as follows: red = gluconeogenesis; purple = pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; gold = acetate metabolism; green = glyoxylate bypass; blue = tca cycle. as identified in this study, genes with the expression pattern ↑-↑  compose the transcriptomic signatures shared between n16961r and n16961sd strains
