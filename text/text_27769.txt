BACKGROUND
the human immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region  is highly polymorphic . it is believed that no chromosomes share the same set of ighv gene segments in the human population. however, the extent of the polymorphisms, their impact on antibody diversity and the mechanisms underlying the formation of these polymorphic regions remain unclear as studying polymorphisms in this region is a daunting task. the high degree of sequence identity among the repetitive sequences makes it extremely difficult to distinguish between allelic and paralogous sequences. because the region is highly polymorphic, it is necessary to separate individual allelic variants or haplotypes for study of this region while the commonly available and analyzable samples are usually diploid. to overcome these barriers, we have developed a suite of innovative techniques. by using single sperm cells, the haplotypes in the polymorphic regions can be analyzed individually and precisely. since paralogous sequences are present in the same sperm and allelic sequences always segregate into different gametes, these sequences can be readily distinguished in this way. our high-throughput multiplex dna sequence detection technique can detect a large number of genetic markers and dna sequence tags in single haploid cells  <cit> . these techniques allowed us to indentify several polymorphic regions in the ighv gene complex .

one of these polymorphic regions, designated as region ii, identified in our earlier studies is of particular interest. region ii was initially noticed when we mapped the gene segments in ighv <dig> and ighv <dig> families in two haplotypes  <cit> . interestingly, all ighv <dig> and ighv <dig> gene segments were not detectable in a large block between ighv gene segments, 4- <dig> and 4- <dig> in one haplotype, and three gene segments between 1- <dig> and 4- <dig> were missing in the other. later, this region was detected again by chimge et al.  <cit> . surprisingly, in that study, only two gene segments  were undetectable in one of the ten haplotypes in this region. segmental duplication and deletion in this region were implicated for gene segments  <dig> iii/hv <dig>  and hv3019b <dig>   <cit> . later, additional gene segments dp <dig> and two copies of dp <dig> , and dp <dig> and dp <dig>  were shown to be located within the duplicated region  <cit> . all these gene segments fall into region ii detected in the present studies. results from the above studies raise several questions:  why is the polymorphic region detected with different sizes and different frequencies in these studies;  if the segmental duplication underlies the polymorphism, what is the size of the duplicated region, and how are the duplicated blocks organized;  how many gene segments are affected by the duplication/deletion;  how much have the gene segment variants diverged; and  what is the biological impact of this polymorphism. the present study was designed to answer these questions.

RESULTS
dna sequence tags , with an average spacing of ~ <dig> kb were selected from the previously described polymorphic region, region ii, including certain flanking sequences on both sides, spanning  <dig>  bp in the grch <dig> human genome reference assembly http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/human/release_notes.html . genotypes  of the tags were determined by analyzing  <dig> to  <dig> single sperm samples from each of six sperm donors after multiplex pcr amplification and microarray detection. microarray images for two single sperm samples of different parental origins from donor ab <dig> are shown in figure  <dig>  table  <dig> summarizes the results.

haplotype patterns of the polymorphic tags
as shown in table  <dig>  the polymorphic region is flanked by five consecutive non-polymorphic tags  on one side and two  on the other. two undetectable tags, vhs <dig> and  <dig>  are immediately adjacent to this region. the region is divided into two nearly equal portions by vhs <dig>  four of the  <dig> haplotypes  were shown to have two or more consecutively undetectable tags. undetectable tags in haplotype  <dig> of donor # <dig> are distributed consecutively in the entire polymorphic region. region containing undetectable tags in haplotype  <dig> in donor d <dig> is the smallest which contains only two tags.

large duplicate blocks identified by sequence analysis
to learn about the cause and detailed content of this polymorphic region, sequences of the ighv region from the three human genomic sequence assemblies http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/human/release_notes.html in the database maintained by the national center for biotechnological information  were analyzed. the grch <dig> assembly is an updated version from the international human genome project; the huref alternative assembly represents a composite haploid version of a single individual's diploid genome sequence  <cit> , and the celera alternative assembly is an integration of genomic sequences of five human individuals  <cit> . although quite a few human whole-genome have been sequenced by next generation sequencing, these sequences were generated from diploid dna samples and assembled from short sequence reads using known sequences as references. the suitability of these sequences for study of highly polymorphic regions needs to be further demonstrated. therefore, these sequences were not included in the comparison.

we first analyzed the internal structure of region ii in the grch <dig> assembly. a repeating sequence block was revealed between tags vhs <dig> and  <dig> . it has two complete copies that are  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively. a third copy is incomplete with only  <dig> bp. these copies correspond to the sequence from position  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> on chromosome  <dig> . in all three genomic assemblies, the region starts with a sequence stretch of caaggatgtgaggaagtagaaccacagataataaagaaagaggagtcctggggacagctg and ends with cttttgggctcaccctgggaggtgtatgctggctgtgccctctgagaactcagttctctt. each of the two complete copies contains six ighv segments which are in the same order and share a sequence identity of 93% to 99% between the counterparts . the only gene segment, 4- <dig>  in the incomplete copy shares a sequence identity of 90% with the two counterparts in the complete copies.

divergence among the polymorphic variants
we further explored this duplicate region by comparing the sequences in the three genomic assemblies. figure  <dig> shows an image of a comparison between the grch <dig> and huref assemblies  using a dot matrix plotting program http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/molkit/dnadot/. as shown, a number of sequence blocks share a high degree of sequence identity between the two assemblies. however, discontinuity of these blocks indicates that extensive genetic shuffling has occurred in this region.

the divergence between the two assemblies is also reflected by the number, composition and organization of the gene segments. as shown in figure  <dig>  the variable portion between the two assemblies is  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb in the grch <dig> and huref assemblies, respectively. in this portion, the grch <dig> assembly contains ten ighv gene segments, 4- <dig> p, 3-29p, 3- <dig>  4- <dig> p, 3- <dig> p, 4- <dig>  4- <dig> p, 3-32p, 3- <dig>  and 4- <dig> , while six gene segments are seen in the huref assembly. because these six gene segments are all different from those in grch <dig>  they are designated as ighv4- <dig> a, 4- <dig> p, 3- <dig> p, 3- <dig> , 4- <dig>  and 3- <dig> . ighv3- <dig>  is a partial gene segment compared with the closest gene segment, ighv3- <dig>  in the grch <dig> assembly. although the huref has two undetermined sequence blocks which may harbor more genes, the differences between the two assemblies are obvious:  3- <dig>  is the most 5' gene segment in huref, while grch <dig> has an additional gene segment, 4- <dig> p;  4- <dig> a in huref is an inserted gene segment compared with grch37; and  based on the size of the smaller undetermined region , huref may not have the counterparts gene segments for 4- <dig> p and 3- <dig> p found in the grch <dig> assembly.

back to the haplotype configurations in table  <dig>  it is obvious that the boundaries of the variable portion are consistent with those in the two sequence assemblies. this portion in all samples is flanked by two non-polymorphic tags, vhs <dig> and vhs <dig>  with vhs <dig> in haplotype  <dig> of donor # <dig> being an exception. the variable portion of haplotype  <dig> in donor # <dig> and haplotype  <dig> in donor d <dig> involves only one repeating unit and that of haplotype  <dig> in donor # <dig> and haplotype  <dig> in ab <dig> involves both complete copies. the three undetectable tags  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> display a periodic pattern although vhs  <dig> is not located within the duplicated region.

at the nucleotide sequence level, the gene segments between the two assemblies are surprisingly diverged to a degree that is significantly higher than the genomic average rate of one base substitution for each  <dig>  bp, or  <dig> %. as shown in table  <dig>  the differences between the allelic counterparts in the two assemblies range from  <dig> % to  <dig> % or  <dig>  to  <dig>  bases when translated into the number of differences for each  <dig>  bp, reflecting considerably higher mutagenic activities and limited selection pressure in this region. if the mutation rates are the same between the alleles and the paralogous copies, the allelic differences should be similar to the differences between the paralogous gene segments. indeed, results from most gene segments in table  <dig> support this notion. the allelic and paralogous differences between the gene segments are very close and there is no clear cut way to distinguish between these two types of sequences. this is a serious challenge for study of these regions, and also demonstrates the importance of using haploid material for study of this type of regions. exceptions are two boundary gene segments, 4- <dig> and 4- <dig>  which have identical alleles in difference assemblies and are much more different from their paralogous counterparts. this could be, at least in part, caused by the divergence of gene segments located within the duplicated region.

sequence for the major portion of the polymorphic region  in celera assembly remains undetermined. sequence data is available for only three small fragments of  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp, and  <dig> bp which are closer to the sequence in repeat ii than that in repeat i in grch <dig>  difference in these small regions between celera and grch <dig>  between celera and huref, and between huref and grch <dig> is  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively compared with  <dig> % for the genomic average, reflecting a high level of mutation rate in the intergenic regions. these rates are also significantly higher than the average allelic difference in the gene regions which is  <dig> % .

impact of sequence divergence on the function of ighv gene segments
functional paralogous counterparts of ighv gene segments are found in the two complete copies and the incomplete copy of the duplicate block in the grch <dig> assembly . these include two ighv <dig> gene segments, 3- <dig> and 3- <dig>  and three ighv <dig> gene segments, 4- <dig>  4- <dig> and 4- <dig>  although the three ighv <dig> gene segments have considerably diverged from each other , and four single-nucleotide differences are found between the two ighv <dig> gene segments . the exons of these gene segments all remain in open reading frames .

the huref assembly has two ighv <dig> gene segments, 4- <dig> and 4- <dig>  outside of the polymorphic region. these gene segments are identical to their allelic counterparts in grch <dig>  allelic counterparts for the remaining three functional gene segments in grch <dig> are all found in huref. in addition, huref has an extra gene segment, 4- <dig> a which is mostly close to 4- <dig>  as mentioned above, the allelic differences between the counterpart gene segments in the polymorphic region of the two assemblies range from  <dig> % to  <dig> % . however, exons in all these four gene segments including 3- <dig>  in huref are in orfs. only a partial sequence of 3- <dig>  is known. its exon  <dig> and the known portion of exon  <dig> are also in an orf.

by contrast, the differences between paralogous ighv gene segments within each complete duplicate block are much greater than those between the counterparts of the duplicate copies. as shown in figure  <dig>  each complete duplicate block contains three ighv <dig> gene segments and three ighv <dig> gene segments, one functional and two pseudogene segments for each family. both ighv <dig> pseudogene segments are in full length compared with the functional ones while the two ighv <dig> pseudogene segments are truncated at about  <dig> bp upstream of exon  <dig>  within each duplicate block, sequence identity between the truncated pseudogene segments and the corresponding portions of the full length ones and between the full-length gene segments for each of the two families are under 80%, indicating that divergence among these gene segments occurred much earlier than the block duplication in this region.

sequence variation and tag detection
the hyper-variability in region ii may have significant impact on tag detection. tags that are undetectable in a consecutive pattern may indicate structural alterations. as shown in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  the patterns of the undetectable tag clusters are consistent with the range of repeat units. table  <dig> also shows that in all haplotypes, tags  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were undetectable while  <dig> was detectable. we first confirmed these experimental results independently by amplifying these tag sequences individually with  <dig> to  <dig> single sperm samples from donor ac <dig> followed by gel electrophoresis. all results obtained in this way were consistent with those obtained by multiplex pcr and microarray. this is understandable because the ighv sequence that we used for tag selection was in the grch <dig> assembly and was from a japanese genome by matsuda et al  <cit>  while the sperm donors used in the present study were all caucasians. tag  <dig> that was detectable in all individuals may be located in a region that is conserved between the two populations and tags that were undetectable may be affected by sequences polymorphic between japanese and caucasian. since the donor of huref is a caucasian  <cit> , we compared the tag sequences between grch <dig> and huref for the above four tags. as expected, no difference was found between the two assemblies for tag  <dig> while the other three have multiple polymorphic bases in either primers, probes or both. for tag  <dig>  a two-base substitution is located in the middle of the probe region and the template base for fluorescently labeled base incorporation is also polymorphic which alone makes the detection of the allele in huref impossible. in tag  <dig>  two polymorphic bases affect the r primer and three are located in the probe region. for tag  <dig>  two polymorphic bases are located in the middle of the probe region, and one is within and next to the 3' end of the f primer which may seriously affect the amplification efficiency.

discussion
why haploid genomes?
evidence for extensive polymorphisms in the ighv region has been observed in a large number of studies . however, detailed analysis of polymorphic regions consisting of highly repetitive sequences represents a serious challenge. of the gaps left by the human genome project, 52% are regions containing repetitive sequences  <cit> . this is probably why celera and huref assemblies have large blocks of undetermined sequences in the ighv region. as shown in table  <dig>  in many cases the differences between allelic and paralogous sequences are very close. when they are present in the same diploid sample, no set measurement can be used to distinguish between these two types of sequences. although the heterozygous state of a tag can be determined using a quantitative method, it would be difficult to learn the haplotype configurations of the polymorphic tags in the entire region. we unmasked the polymorphic regions and distinguished between allelic and paralogous sequences by analyzing individual haplotypes in single sperm cells. using evenly spaced unique sequence tags of a high density, we identified polymorphic regions unambiguously. the haplotype configurations of the polymorphic tags could also be determined.

three genomic sequence assemblies, i.e., grch <dig>  huref and celera, were used for sequence analysis of the polymorphic region. although these assemblies were generated using diploid genomic dna, they are composite haplotype sequences because individual dna clones used for sequencing were derived from individual haplotypes. on the other hand, because of the presence of different variants, it is possible to have clones with significantly different sequences for a polymorphic region. clones of different haplotype origins could be very confusing. the level of confusion may depend on the size of clones, the number and density of polymorphic sites and the overlapping size between adjacent clones. however, given the high density of polymorphic sites in region ii, the chance of constructing a contig composited from different haplotypes at sequence level would be very low. if the number of polymorphic sites in the overlapping regions is insufficient in a region for building up the haplotype contigs, the authors would treat the region as undetermined.

natural selection and gene function in region ii
polymorphisms generated from non-reciprocal meiotic rearrangements in regions consisting of duplicated blocks may represent one of the major causes underlying the ighv region diversity. as shown in figure  <dig>  the highly diverged sequence spacers between the conserved blocks indicate that complex genetic events may have occurred in this region so that these variants have considerably diverged from each other. as the field progresses rapidly, the gene-nursery role of low-copy repeats  has become more and more evident. new genes may form through various nonreciprocal crossovers in the lcr regions resulting in duplication, deletion, inversion, translocation, and gene conversion/fusion/fission . in some cases, gene number/structure changes may subject to greater selection pressure, while in other cases changes may not be affected or even favored by natural selection. in the latter cases, the lcr regions may display a complex polymorphic pattern. the scenario in region ii described in the present study likely belongs to the latter category. although changes in this region involve many gene segments, it is difficult to imagine how much and how fast the selection pressure would affect the number and composition of the ighv gene segments. therefore, newly formed gene segments may have diverged from their original form so that no gene segment in the huref assembly is identical to those in the grch <dig> assembly in region ii. however, selection pressure is implicated in the gene regions as the intergenic difference ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % while the allelic difference is only  <dig> %, indicating the functional importance of the gene segments in this region.

it seems surprising that none of the paralogous and the allelic counterparts in orfs was inactivated although in many cases, differences between paralogous counterparts and those between allelic counterparts for the gene segments in orfs are either greater than or comparable to the differences between their pseudogene counterparts . a natural question would be why these gene segments remain in orfs or whether the selection pressure has played a role in keeping their orfs? the fact that among the  <dig> ighv gene segments reported by matsuda et al.  <cit> ,  <dig>  are pseudogenes indicated that selection effect in the ighv region is not evident in general.

two types of genetic alterations may inactivate an ighv gene segment, i.e., point or minor mutation and unequal meiotic crossover. by sequencing complete genomes of a human family of four members , roach et al.  <cit>  showed that the mutation rate in the human genome is  <dig>  × 10- <dig> bases/base/haploid genome/generation. given that  <dig> of the  <dig> non-stop genetic codons can be changed into stop codons by changing a single base, the total length of the two exons in each ighv gene segment is ~ <dig> bp, and a human generation is  <dig> years, about  <dig>  million years is needed to change an ighv gene segment in an orf into a pseudogene segment. among the  <dig> ighv pseudogenes,  <dig> were inactivated by point mutations or other minor changes, and  <dig> which are about twice of those caused by point and minor mutations were caused by major structural changes with the majority by truncations. based on this rate, if both genetic alterations responsible for structural changes and point mutation are taken into consideration,  <dig>  million years are need to inactivate an ighv gene segment in an orf. on the other hand, the difference between the two complete repeats in region ii is  <dig> % , which needs  <dig>  million years to achieve,  <dig>  times longer than the time needed for inactivate a gene segment. one may argue that the mutation rate may be significantly higher in the ighv region than other chromosomal regions. however, a generally higher rate for the ighv region should not affect comparison between the gene regions and other sequence in the repeats.

the fact that gene segments in orfs remain in orfs after duplication indicates that selection pressure may have played an important role in keeping these gene segments functional. this hypothesis is further supported by the fact that there are only about eight ighv <dig> gene segments in each haploid genome, three , i.e., 4- <dig>  4- <dig> and 4- <dig>  are located in the duplicated region. therefore, functionality of these genes may have significant impact on resistance to certain severe diseases. other than the segmental duplication reported in our present study, walter et al.  <cit>  also observed duplication of 3- <dig> and 4- <dig> segments, which may enhance the carriers' immune capacity. however, some of these gene segments may be related to the susceptibility of diseases. for example, the unchanged germline form of  <dig> iii, an allelic variant of ighv3- <dig>  may encode an autoantibody  <cit> .

to learn the causes for gene segment truncation, we analyzed the flanking sequences for the four truncated gene segments, 4- <dig> p, 4- <dig> p, 4- <dig> p and 4- <dig> p, in region ii using the repeat masking program  <cit>  at the website http://www.girinst.org/censor/index.php of the genetic information research institute. although transposon or retroviral activities may account for the truncation of other ighv gene segments , no sequence was shown to be transposable element or retrovirus related immediately next to the truncated gene segments in region ii. therefore, it is likely that these truncations may have been caused by unequal crossovers. the fact that the sequences of paralogous counterparts of the ighv gene segments in the two complete repeats are very similar and their lengths are either the same or very close indicate that the truncation occurred before the occurrence of duplication in region ii.

genetic variation and tag detection
comparison between the sequences in different assemblies helps us understand why the majority of tags in region ii are polymorphic while a few others are non-polymorphic or undetectable. as shown in figure  <dig>  sequences in different assemblies share sequence blocks with a high degree of identity. however, these blocks are non-consecutive and interrupted by highly diverged sequences. when a tag is located in a highly diverged area and selected based on a specific sequence assembly, it may not be detectable in a significant portion of samples that do not contain these assembly-specific sequences. it may be detected in all samples if it is located in a highly conserved  region. conventionally, undetectability of a sequence tag is considered as indication of deletion. however, sequence variants in the polymorphic region presented in the current study suggest that deletion is only one of the possibilities. a high degree of sequence divergence may significantly affect the detectability but there may not be any sequence deletion at all.

complexity of region ii
it is possible that more complex duplication/deletion patterns exist in region ii in the human population. walter et al.  <cit>  described a map with two ighv gene segments, 3- <dig> and 4- <dig> repeated three times  between the ighv gene segments 4- <dig>  and 4- <dig> . on their map, dp <dig> is an inserting segment between dp <dig> and dp <dig> and has a close sequence to 4- <dig> which is similar to 4- <dig> a in the huref assembly in which, however, 4- <dig> a is inserted between 4- <dig> p and 4- <dig> . these observations raise two questions:  whether 4- <dig> is located within a highly active genetic element and/or  whether the areas at the boundaries of the duplicated units are genetically very active so that exchange in these areas between the duplicated copies occurs at a high frequency. the latter is supported by the results summarized in table  <dig>  the fact that the sequence tags vhs <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are not detectable in all haplotypes suggests that sequence divergence in these regions has reached a high level by the frequently occurring genetic events so that tag sequence selected from one haplotype may have significantly diverged from others. on the other hand, although 3- <dig> and 4- <dig> were repeated three times and segments 4- <dig> and 4- <dig> were also observed in the map described by walter et al.  <cit> , the remaining eight gene segments observed in the grch <dig> were missing in their map. such complexity among the haplotypes constitutes a significant source of ighv diversity in the human population. it also warrants sequence level analysis with haploid materials for thorough and accurate understanding of this region.

approach used in the present study to analysis of copy number variants
copy number variants  occupy a significant portion of the human genome  <cit>  and may affect the functions of genes  <cit>  and/or contribute to genetic diseases by altering gene dosage and/or sequences  <cit> . so far, large-scale analysis of cnvs has been limited to copy number estimation in diploid genomes. with diploid genomes, it is impossible to learn the number, composition and organization of the cnv copies in individual haplotypes. in addition, the resolution of commonly used microarray-based quantitative methods for studies of copy number changes diminishes as the copy number increases. our method provides a very efficient way for detailed analysis of cnv regions. with this approach, all known copies of a cnv can be "tagged" so that the number of copy can be counted as "yes" or "no" based on the microarray signals. using single sperm as subjects, not only the number but also the composition and configuration of the cnv copies in each haploid sample can be determined. we have shown that our multiplex system may be used to analyze more than  <dig>  genetic markers in single sperm samples . after whole genome amplification of a single sperm, a small aliquot is sufficient for each multiplex amplification reaction. pcr products from many multiplex amplification reactions can be pooled together, allowing thousands of sequences analyzed by a single microarray. therefore, our system can be easily expanded for high-throughput, comprehensive and detailed cnv analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
using single sperm as subjects, we identified the haplotype variants in a large region marked by a group of polymorphic dna sequence tags. detailed sequence comparison between human genomic sequence assemblies revealed underlying large duplicate sequence blocks. the variants show unusually high level of divergence in their sequences and in ighv gene segment number, composition and organization, indicating limited selection pressure in general. the underlying mechanism could be one of the major mechanisms responsible for ighv region diversity. significant difference between the levels of divergence in the gene segment regions and intergenic region may imply difference in selection pressure on these regions and the functional importance of these ighv gene segments. our experimental system with unique sequence tags, single sperm and highly sensitive multiplex dna sequence detection may be used for study of complex chromosomal regions similar to the igh region.
