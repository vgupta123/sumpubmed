BACKGROUND
human malaria transmission is dependent on efficient development of plasmodium parasites within anopheline mosquito vectors. anopheline mosquitoes are a large subfamily comprising nearly five hundred species distributed in subtropical and tropical areas around the world, but only a small percentage  are malaria vectors  <cit> . intriguingly, malaria infection rates among anopheline species do not correlate with mosquito phylogenetic relationships, suggesting that genetic traits associated with vectorial capacity have quickly and independently evolved in different species  <cit> .

vectorial capacity is a highly complex biological phenomenon depending on mosquito behavior, lifespan and innate refractoriness or susceptibility to plasmodium infection, which may result from the co-evolutionary forces driving the tripartite interaction between humans, mosquitoes and parasites  <cit> . as a result of the sequencing of the anopheles gambiae and plasmodium falciparum genomes, a great deal of information regarding our understanding of mosquito-pathogen interactions at a molecular level has been gained  <cit> . post genome research has highlighted the role of the an. gambiae innate immune response in determining mosquito refractoriness to plasmodium <cit> .

in addition to the mosquito’s innate ability to transmit malarial parasites, critical aspects of mosquito biology, like adaptation to diverse niches, host seeking behavior, and resistance to insecticides are still unknown. novel strategies for control, based on a deep understanding of mosquito biology and evolution, will be required to achieve the goal of eventual malaria eradication. rapid technological advances in dna sequencing, protein characterization by mass spectrometry and bioinformatics offer unique opportunities to generate large catalogs of genes, proteins and biological networks that may enable the identification of potential mosquito control targets beyond the an. gambiae-p. falciparum dyad  <cit> , which can be harnessed by novel strategies such as transgenesis, mosquito-based transmission blocking vaccines  <cit>  and alternative insecticides  <cit> .

plasmodium vivax malaria still represents a major health and socio-economic burden in asia, the western pacific and the americas  <cit> . malaria in the americas is transmitted by several anopheline species, including species belonging to the nyssorhynchus subgenus, which is unique to the new world. anopheles  albimanus is a major vector in southern méxico, central america and the northern region of south america  <cit> . the nyssorhynchus subgenus is thought to be the earliest diverged branch of the anopheline radiation, which probably occurred more than one hundred million years  ago when the supercontinent gondwana separated to give rise to the actual south american and african continents  <cit> . the proposed independent emergence of vectorial traits in conjunction with their rapid evolution may imply different molecular strategies involved in p. vivax and p. falciparum refractoriness and susceptibility in this subgenus. however, very little molecular information exists for any of the new world anopheline vectors, except for anopheles  darlingi whose genome draft was recently released  <cit> . the an. albimanus genome is scheduled for genome sequencing in the near future  <cit> .

we describe herein the results of a gene discovery based cdna sequencing project combining conventional sanger with next generation sequencing  platforms to analyze cdna samples derived from an. albimanus tissues including the midgut, cuticular fat body, dorsal vessel and salivary gland, which are critical organs involved in the plasmodium life cycle  <cit>  . the main objective of our study was to construct a reference transcriptome that will facilitate molecular and applied studies of an. albimanus refractoriness to plasmodium infection and other biological processes relevant for disease transmission. finally, to maximize accessibility for this and future transcriptome sequencing projects in the absence of a genome sequence, we developed an open-source sequence annotation browser called gdav . the an. albimanus transcriptome annotations are available via the vectorbase website .

RESULTS
the an. albimanus transcriptome assembly
to capture as much of the transcriptome of the tissues involved in the interaction with plasmodium spp. as possible, we combined transcriptome data generated with sanger,  <dig> and illumina sequencing platforms from several different sources of adult female an. albimanus rna. table 1a describes the origin of the rna used to generate cdna libraries sequenced by the different platforms, as well as the read number contribution of each. owing to the inherent differences in throughput of each of the sequencing platforms used, most of the final dataset contains illumina reads derived from the midgut transcriptome , and nearly half of the transcripts were built with at least one  <dig> read. only 6% of the built transcripts contained one or more sanger reads . there were  <dig>   transcripts expressed exclusively in the midgut,  <dig>  were derived specifically from cuticular epithelium/fat body, and  <dig>  were expressed only in the dorsal vessel, whereas the rest  were found in two or more tissues .

an initial transcriptome assembly was performed by combining all sequence reads described in table 1a, which generated  <dig>  contigs. re-mapping the sanger and  <dig> reads to the initial assembly revealed that a substantial number of  <dig>  and sanger reads  were not represented in the initial transcriptome assembly, so they were re-assembled using gs assembler, generating an additional set of  <dig> contigs. the total transcript dataset included  <dig>  contigs with a mean contig length of  <dig> bp and a n <dig> of  <dig>  bp . our assembly metrics closely resemble the recently published ngs and sanger data on the an. funestus transcriptome, which yielded  <dig>  contigs with a n <dig> of  <dig>  bp  <cit> . similar results were also reported in de novo transcriptome assembly studies for the planarian worm, schmidtea mediterranea in which  <dig> reads were pre-assembled to serve as scaffolds for illumina paired-end assembly, yielding  <dig>  contigs with a n <dig> of  <dig>  kb  <cit> , and  <dig>  contigs with a mean length of  <dig>  bp  <cit> .

as a surrogate approach to estimate the contribution of each sequencing platform to the assembly quality, the transcript dataset was split into two subsets according to whether transcripts were assembled with only illumina reads or with illumina and  <dig> or sanger reads. the illumina-only subset was composed of  <dig>  transcripts with a mean contig length of  <dig> bp and a n <dig> of  <dig>  bp. the composite subset  had a mean contig length of  <dig>  bp and a n <dig> of  <dig>  bp , which is similar to the recently published aedes albopictus transcriptome using  <dig> sequencing  <cit> . we then evaluated if there were differences in the proportion of homolog proteins in the an. gambiae predicted proteome using blastx  between both subsets. we did not observe a difference in the proportion of transcript matches between the illumina-only subset and the composite ones . however, the an. gambiae protein length coverage of translated transcripts was considerably improved in those transcripts belonging to the composite subset  since 53% of their transcripts covered more than 70% of the an. gambiae target, whereas only 25% of the illumina-only transcripts had an equivalent an. gambiae target coverage.

genome mapping results to an. gambiae and an. darlingi
since there is no genome sequence available for an. albimanus, unambiguous sequence alignment of an. albimanus transcripts to a reference anopheline genome could provide additional measures of the transcriptome assembly accuracy and completeness. moreover, it could provide the means for refining reference genome annotation and provide evidence of functionally conserved genes that were missed by current gene finding algorithms  <cit> . the final cdna assembly was mapped to the an. gambiae  and an. darlingi genomes . the current version of the an. gambiae pest strain genome  is  <dig>  mbp long and it is in an advanced stage of assembly   <cit>  and annotation   <cit> . the an. darlingi genome was sequenced using  <dig> sequencing and is in an early stage of assembly  and annotation   <cit> . using transcript to genome dna alignment ,  <dig>  an. albimanus transcripts  aligned  to the an. darlingi genome. expressed as aligned base pairs,  <dig>  of  <dig>  mbp  of the an. albimanus transcriptome aligned to the an. darlingi genome . transcriptome mapping with the same parameters to the an. gambiae genome resulted in  <dig>  aligned contigs  with  <dig>  mbp  aligned. contigs that aligned to an. darlingi but not to the an. gambiae genome were predominantly short contigs  . as expected from the overall transcriptome aligned fraction, the fraction of an. albimanus transcript sequences that aligned to an. darlingi  was considerably higher than for the an. gambiae genome, such that 76% of an. albimanus transcripts that were mapped to the an. darlingi genome aligned with more than 90% of their respective length . our mapping results using an. darlingi as the reference genome are significantly better than those described for the planarian worm s. mediterranea, which were mapped to its own genome  <cit> , suggesting that despite its early stage of annotation, the an. darlingi genome is an appropriate surrogate genome for an. albimanus, and supports the accuracy and quality of our assembly. transcripts that did not map to the an. darlingi genome , as well as partial alignments may represent mis-assemblies in the transcriptome or the genome, rapidly evolving genes or the rapid evolution of untranslated regions . conversely, poor mapping to the an. gambiae reference genome may be result of all the above, further confounded by the increased evolutionary distance separating the two species.

a mapping was done using exonerate v  <dig> . using the est2genome mode  <cit> .

an analysis of the protein length coverage for an. albimanus-an.gambiae blastx alignments showed a considerable proportion of transcripts with only partial coverage of their corresponding an. gambiae match , indicating the possibility of multiple hits per an. gambiae gene. the extent of multiple transcripts mapping to a single an. gambiae gene was estimated by comparing transcript to genome and an. gambiae gene coordinates. anopheles albimanus transcripts mapped partially or fully within the sequences of  <dig>  an. gambiae genes, and 62% of these transcripts did so within a single an. gambiae gene . based on our protein length coverage observations , we noted a higher proportion of single gene hits in the composite subset  than in the illumina-only subset  .

as an additional approach to estimate transcript completeness, we used reference genome mapping to analyze exon coverage. as expected from the phylogenetic relationships, transcript mapping to the an. darlingi genome showed higher average exon coverage  than to the an. gambiae genome , which falls below the  <dig>  exons per transcript in an. gambiae <cit>  . however, there was no proportional difference in the exon coverage using an. gambiae or an. darlingi relative to the number of significant alignments . more than half  of our mapped transcript dataset covers at least two exons, whereas in an. gambiae, more than 86% of the genes are composed of at least two exons . only ten and thirty-one transcripts that mapped to an. gambiae and an. darlingi, respectively, had more than  <dig> exons, compared to  <dig> for an. gambiae. the an. albimanus transcript that covered most exons  when mapped to the an. darlingi genome was locus_3073_length_ <dig> , and corresponds to the an. gambiae agap <dig> homolog, which is predicted to have  <dig> exons .

in summary, transcript mapping to reference genomes and the derived analysis of exon structure of our transcript dataset revealed a degree of incompleteness when using an. gambiae as our reference. the increased proportion of genome alignments without a spanning intron  observed in an. albimanus could result from incorrect splitting of the transcript during the assembly of transcriptional units having more than one exon. correct exon representation is relevant because alternative splicing is a means to increase proteome diversity and this phenomenon has been observed frequently among dipterans  <cit> . incomplete exon-exon structure across an. albimanus transcripts could underestimate the diversity of protein configurations and thus, may limit protein identification by proteomic approaches in the absence of the genome, and empirical studies to assess this possibility are required to fill in this gap in knowledge. despite the limitations in our dataset, information regarding exon-exon structure may be useful for experimentalists when designing primers and probes for one gene-targeted analysis.

estimated proteome coverage
as a starting point for transcript annotation, the proportion of the an. albimanus transcriptome that was homologous to a predicted protein sequence in other genomes was analyzed. protein similarity to other insect proteomes and the ncbi nr databases was assessed using blastx . a total of  <dig>  sequences  in our dataset had a significant match with at least one species. however, we note that probably due to methodological differences, this proportion is lower than the 84% match described by crawford, when the an. funestus transcriptome was compared with the an. gambiae proteome  <cit> .

contrary to what would be expected based on degree of evolutionary relationships, and the results observed in transcript to genome alignments, we observed that a higher proportion of an. albimanus transcripts  had a match with an. gambiae than with an. darlingi  . however, a comparison between an. darlingi and an. gambiae revealed that 80% of the an. darlingi proteins matched the an. gambiae proteome. this can be partially explained because the an. albimanus predicted proteome is considerably larger  than the an. darlingi predicted proteome.

considering the total amount of protein coding genes in each of the sequenced vector genomes, 51% of an. gambiae and 48% of the an. darlingi protein coding genes matched at least one transcript in an. albimanus, whereas an. darlingi covered 62% of the an. gambiae proteome. proteome coverage tended to decrease according to phylogenetic distance . however, the proportion of significant best hits decreased according to phylogenetic relatedness, so that protein percent identity among best blastx hits was the highest with an. darlingi , and decreased according to phylogenetic distance .

the lower number of transcript matches observed between an. albimanus and an. darlingi than between an. albimanus and an. gambiae is likely the consequence of both the incompleteness of the an. albimanus dataset due to sampling of only a limited set of tissues from adult mosquitoes, and the current incomplete assembly status of the an. darlingi genome . moreover, the an. gambiae genome annotation relied heavily on homology based annotation approaches  <cit> , and thus is very conservative. this implies that rapidly evolving genes may escape identification by such conservative approaches. combining conservative and ab initio gene prediction strategies increased considerably the amount and quality of the an. gambiae protein coding genes  <cit> . given the fact that most of the an. albimanus transcripts mapped to the an. darlingi genome, many transcripts may in fact be derived from true protein coding genes. additionally, many of the sequences could represent non-protein coding transcripts of potential biological significance  <cit> .

orthologs
the proportion of the core eukaryotic genome covered by the an. albimanus transcriptome was investigated by searching for the  <dig> core eukaryotic protein models  <cit>  in the an. albimanus predicted proteome, as well as the predicted proteomes of an. darlingian. gambiaeae. aegyptic. quinquefasciatus d. melanogaster, i. scapularis, p. humanus and rhodnius prolixus. as expected, we observed almost complete coverage for d. melanogaster  and an. gambiae genomes . we identified  <dig> core eukaryotic genes  in the an. albimanus dataset corresponding to 90% coverage. coverage ranged from 95-98% in the other genome sequenced species. the lowest coverage was observed for an. darlingi , which as discussed in the previous section, may reflect the early stage of that sequencing project .

an important goal of the anopheles genome cluster will be to define a “core anopheline genome”. due to the incompleteness of the predicted proteome for an. albimanus, we reasoned that an an. albimanus - an. gambiae comparison could be very inaccurate in terms of ortholog prediction. however, using an. darlingi as an additional species for bidirectional comparisons, specificity could be increased but at the expense of sensitivity. to identify putative orthologs we used blastx and tblastn for bidirectional comparisons among the an. gambiaean. darlingi and an. albimanus proteomes. anopheles albimanus - an. darlingian. albimanus - an. gambiae and an. darlingi - an. gambiae bidirectional comparisons revealed  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  best reciprocal hits, respectively. the three species comparison yielded a set of  <dig>  1:1: <dig> putative orthologs  . the 1: <dig> ortholog dataset between an. darlingi and an. gambiae comprised 64% and 60% of their proteome, respectively. the proportion of orthologs between an. gambiae and d. melanogaster is  <dig> and 44%, respectively  <cit> , and ranged between 73%  to 93%  within the drosophila cluster  <cit> .

to further validate the accuracy of our ortholog assignment, we compared protein length coverage, using pair-wise alignments between translated an. albimanus proteins and their corresponding best match in an. gambiae. a considerable improvement of protein length coverage was observed in orthologs , when compared to the protein coverage of the overall dataset . as described previously , protein coverage displayed a bimodal distribution where 40% of the translated an. albimanus products covered at least two thirds of their corresponding an. gambiae matches and another 40% covered less than one third . a significant and expected improvement was observed in the ortholog dataset, which was biased toward higher coverage, resulting in 66% of the orthologs covering more than two thirds of their corresponding an. gambiae matches .

if our blast best reciprocal hit ortholog prediction strategy was accurate, we would expect that all the core eukaryotic genes  found would be represented in the 1:1: <dig> ortholog dataset. as shown in table  <dig>  only  <dig> of the identified an. albimanus cegs were included in the three species ortholog dataset, which corresponds to 61% of the core eukaryotic genome. however, the proportion of cegs found between two species best reciprocal hits was higher and ranged from  <dig> to 83%. together, our data indicate that although there is a relatively high coverage of the core eukaryotic genome, the anopheline ortholog assignment remains incomplete , and may be inaccurate .

functional annotation of the an. albimanus transcriptome
to gain insight into the predicted functional characteristics of the current dataset, translated products were functionally annotated using the gene ontology  classification as implemented in the blast2go software  <cit> , as well as using the interpro classification  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  transcripts were annotated according to biological process, and  <dig>  transcripts were annotated according to molecular function, which corresponds roughly to one third of all the transcripts in the dataset for both categories, and to one half of the total blastx matches in the vectors’ predicted proteomes .

to gain insight into the protein evolution rate according to biological process and molecular function, the annotated transcriptome dataset was partitioned according to the most abundant biological process and molecular function go slim categories. based on blastx matches, average protein percent identity was estimated for each go slim category, either in the 1:1: <dig> ortholog dataset, or as in all best hits  against the an. gambiae predicted proteome dataset . for both the homologous and orthologous subsets, most conserved proteins belonged to general biological processes such as cytoskeletal organization, ion transport, translation and protein transport , in agreement with other comparative studies in mosquitoes and d. melanogaster <cit> . putative homologous and orthologous proteins assigned as having stress response and transcription functions were the least conserved , consistent with the notion of higher evolutionary rates in genes involved in immune response  <cit> , which are a subset of stress response genes. although the average protein identity observed in the response to stress genes category was lower than the average protein identity in the entire annotated ortholog dataset, such differences were not statistically significant . also, the average protein identity observed in the response to stress genes category was significantly higher relative to the average protein identity in the entire transcriptome  . this may be the result of the high proportion of genes present in our dataset that have no go annotation and that, not surprisingly, are the least conserved .

according to molecular function, the best protein matches, those that were involved in translation, structural functions, calcium and actin binding were the most conserved, which agrees with the initial biological process categorization. the least conserved putative proteins were categorized as electron carrier and proteases, whose conservation was significantly lower than that observed for the translation, actin binding and calcium binding  ontologies. proteases were significantly less conserved than the whole set of annotated predicted proteins . proteases have been reported as being subjected to positive selection in the drosophila genus  <cit> . also, trypsin family proteases have been significantly expanded in an. gambiae compared to d. melanogaster, suggesting faster evolution in anophelines that may be related to hematophagy  <cit> . similarly, electron carrier activity is related to cytochrome function and is overrepresented in our dataset. the cytochrome p <dig> family, involved in insecticide resistance, is also expanded in an. gambiae <cit>  and may be also evolving rapidly in new world anophelines.

the transcript dataset was also annotated using interproscan, which yielded  <dig>  interpro annotations. we noted that  <dig>   transcripts have at least one interpro annotation with an average of  <dig>  annotations per annotated transcript. annotation distribution was similar to an. gambiae . the most abundant annotations, such as zinc-fingers , wd- <dig> repeat , protein kinase domain , armadillo-like fold  and serine/cysteine proteases  and the general substrate transporters of the major facilitator superfamily , were among the top most frequent annotations for both the an. albimanus transcriptome and the an. gambiae predicted proteome  <cit> . this similarity suggests that in general terms and despite being derived from a limited set of adult tissues, the an. albimanus dataset exhibits a similar representation to that of an. gambiae. however, certain interpro annotations were more abundant in the an. albimanus dataset than in an. gambiae. for example, the c-terminal-like glutathione s-transferase   was ranked in the 26th place versus 79th in an. gambiae and contained almost the complete set . other highly ranked annotations that contained near-complete expected sets were e <dig> ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes  ; and peptidase m <dig>  membrane alanine aminopeptidase,  . finally,  <dig> an. albimanus transcripts were annotated as protein of unknown function duf <dig> , which ranked among the top  <dig> most abundant annotated transcripts, whereas in an. gambiae this classification was ranked in the 69th place with  <dig> annotated proteins. considering the over-representation of midgut-derived transcripts in our dataset , aminopeptidase enrichment is expected due to their proteolytic role in blood digestion  <cit> . gsts and other detoxification-related gene expression is particularly enriched in the anterior midgut of an. gambiae larvae  <cit> , suggesting that detoxification may also be maintained in the adult midgut. e <dig> ubiquitin conjugating enzymes are part of a general housekeeping homeostatic mechanism  <cit> , and to our knowledge, they do not play a particular role in midgut physiology. however, in d. melanogaster, up- regulation of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme homolog coded by vihar and the  <dig> s proteosomal subunit rpn <dig> in response to dietary bowman–birk inhibitor  intoxication has been described  <cit> . it can be speculated that overrepresentation of e <dig> ubiquitin conjugating enzymes in the mosquito midgut may be part of a general stress response to different xenobiotics.

a not present.

structurally, the duf <dig> domain overlaps with the scop protein kinase-like  superfamily . the presence of duf <dig> containing predicted homologs was investigated by querying electronically inferred orthology in the biomart database  <cit>  and found that duf <dig> is present in a family of proteins well represented in dipterans, nematodes, and to a lesser extent in other insects, but absent in other invertebrates such as the sea urchin. the number of duf <dig> containing orthologs according to biomart decreased with phylogenetic distance so that between an. gambiae and ae. aegypti there were sixteen 1: <dig> orthologs and between an. gambiae and d. melanogaster or pediculus humanus there were only nine and five, respectively. using vectorbase and mozatlas for microarray data mining to identify significant changes in gene expression  for those an. gambiae genes containing the duf <dig> domain, we found predominant expression in the malpighian tubules, midgut and head of adult mosquitoes, with expression levels higher in males than in females  <cit> . in the midgut,  <dig> out of  <dig> genes had a significantly modified expression pattern after a blood meal  <cit> . five genes were enriched in hemocytes and another five were enriched in the carcass  <cit> . two genes were induced during p. berghei midgut invasion  <cit> .

conversely, certain annotations that are abundantly represented in an. gambiae such as insect cuticle proteins ; tropomyosin ; 7tm chemoreceptor ; mitochondrial rho-like ; olfactory receptor, drosophila ; pollen allergen poa pix/phl pvi, c-terminal  were substantially scarce in our dataset . as expected, olfactory receptors, 7tm chemoreceptors, and pollen allergen were underrepresented protein annotations since they are not expressed in the midgut  <cit> . similarly, insect cuticle proteins that are involved in adult cuticle synthesis show a peak during metamorphosis and are under-expressed in adults  <cit> .

immunity related genes
mosquito immune responses are thought to play an important role in influencing vectorial competence. higher protein divergence in genes implicated in stress response  is in agreement with the observation of higher divergence rate in immunity related genes  than in genes involved in other core cellular processes  <cit> . thus, we searched for potential immunity related genes by comparing our transcript sequences to a manually curated dipteran irg dataset, which includes  <dig> genes classified into  <dig> families implicated in recognition, regulation, signal transduction and effector phases of the immune response  <cit> . we found  <dig> best blastx reciprocal matches between our dataset and the immunodb, representing all  <dig> families. however, this number may be an overestimation of the true number of irgs in our dataset, because it includes a large number of structurally homologous proteins that may not be involved in insect immune responses . to refine our irg search, we considered a rather conservative approach that contemplated the putative orthology as described in the previous section , as well as structural signatures derived from the interpro annotation. among our  <dig>  ortholog 1:1: <dig> dataset,  <dig> ortholog groups have matches in the immunodb  and  <dig> were consistently supported by interpro annotation or other protein family classification system. this set was further increased by the inclusion of three unannotated genes of the toll and imd pathways  with supporting structural evidence based on interpro annotation. this  <dig> irg putative ortholog dataset exhibited 75% average identity to their corresponding an. gambiae proteins, which is very similar to the average identity of all an. albimanus: an. gambiae matches. however, average identity was lower than the average identity of goslim annotated ortholog proteins .

gene duplication has been a major evolutionary force shaping immunity related genes in dipterans  <cit> . thus, the identification of putative irgs in our dataset based solely on the inclusion of ortholog groups may be missing putative irgs. thus, by considering interpro annotations, we found representative matches in  <dig> out of  <dig> families, representing the recognition, signaling, regulation and effector immune response processes.

among the ‘recognition phase’ genes, different pathogen recognition molecules were identified such as six peptidoglycan recognition proteins , including the putative pgrp-ld ortholog  <cit> ; three 1- <dig> β-glucan binding proteins , including the gnbpb <dig> and gnbpa <dig> orthologs  <cit> ; six c-type lectins , including the ctl <dig> ortholog  <cit>  and  <dig> fibrinogen related proteins , including the an. gambiae frep <dig> ortholog , but not an. gambiae frep <dig> ortholog which has been implicated in the anti-plasmodium response  <cit>  . we further identified six thioester containing proteins  based on interpro annotation   <cit>  that were missed by the orthology approach. proteins containing leucine-rich repeats  are highly abundant in metazoans and are involved in molecular recognition in a wide variety of biological processes. as mentioned in the previous section, we identified  <dig> transcripts containing lrr domains . however, mosquitoes possess a unique type of lrr-domain among proteins that are involved in immune responses  <cit> . apart from the lrr, these proteins share structural features including a conserved pattern of cysteine residues and coiled-coil domains. we found one putative leucine rich repeat immune protein  that displays structural features of the long lrim subfamily and two that show compatible features with the short lrim subfamily, including the lrim <dig> putative ortholog   <cit> .

the major immune response signal transduction pathways in dipterans are the toll and the imd pathways. gene members of these pathways tend to be better conserved in different mosquito species than genes implicated in the recognition or effector phases  <cit> . although transcripts containing lrr or toll/interleukin- <dig> receptor homology  domain  were found, a clear toll receptor homolog was not. however, we found important members of the toll pathway such as pellemyd <dig> and traf6; the imd pathway such as casparikk <dig> and ikk <dig> <cit>  and stat pathway such as domesocs and stat <dig> <cit>  , as well as rel <dig> transcription factor  <cit> .

autophagy was originally described as a cellular response to starvation. however, it has recently been shown to be a critical process related to immune and stress responses, clearance of intracellular pathogens and damaged organelles, as well as cell survival. there are several genes involved in the induction of autophagy, autophagosome nucleation, autophagosome expansion and autophagosome recycling  <cit> . there are  <dig> an. gambiae entries in the immunodb related to autophagy. given the importance of all the mentioned processes in malaria transmission, we searched the immunodb for orthologs and found  <dig>  in the induction of the pathway, only the tor homolog was found. similarly, the only homolog involved in the nucleation phase that we found was the bcl- <dig> homolog debcl   <cit> . the remaining ten corresponded to genes involved only in autophagosome expansion such as apg3apg4aapg4bapg7aapg7bapg <dig> and apg <dig> orthologs or autophagosome recycling such as apg2apg <dig> and apg <dig> . in contrast, we found a relative depletion of caspases  and the absence of caspase activators , suggesting that, as in larvae midgut  <cit> , autophagy could be a more active homeostatic tissue process than apoptosis in adult mosquitoes.

CONCLUSIONS
we have explored the adult female transcriptome of an important new world malaria vector, an. albimanus, by sequencing cdna libraries generated from different tissue sources related to the plasmodium life cycle such as midgut, cuticular fat body, dorsal vessel and salivary gland. merging sanger and ngs data into a single assembly generated a robust dataset with adequate transcript lengths that could be effectively mapped to the an. darlingi genome, covered 90% of the core eukaryotic genome and half of the predicted proteome of other mosquito vectors. we identified protein-coding transcripts involved in biological processes such as immune recognition, immune signaling pathways, insecticide resistance and autophagy that may be relevant to the plasmodium cycle or may represent targets for novel control strategies. as a result of this work, the genomic information available for an. albimanus has increased several hundred-fold, thus providing molecular inputs for research in this species: 1) from a single gene perspective; 2) to gain insight into the anopheline radiations in the new world; 3) facilitating further genomic and proteomic approaches; and 4) assisting gene finding and validation of the an. albimanus genome in the context of the anopheles cluster genome sequencing project  <cit> . sequence information, predicted proteome comparisons, transcript mapping to the an. gambiae genome and interpro annotations described in this manuscript are accessible to the community through the vectorbase website .

abdominal cuticles and the underlying fat body were obtained from  <dig> female adult mosquitoes and total rna was extracted with trizol . integrity of rna was verified in the agilent bioanalyzer standard rna chip. one μg of rna was used for full length rt-pcr amplification using the super-smart pcr cdna synthesis kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the pcr amplified cdna library was fragmented by nebulization and subjected to library preparation according to the  <dig> shotgun sequencing protocol. after emulsion pcr titration and amplification, the library was sequenced in a full picotiter plate using the genome sequencer flx platform. a similar approach was used to generate additional midgut libraries from p. vivax infected-mosquitoes at  <dig> h post-infective blood meal  and seven days pibm, but sequenced as pooled bar-coded libraries in half picotiter plate. a third sequencing  <dig> run was performed with two cdna libraries from dissected dorsal vessels, obtained at  <dig> h post-inoculation  with  <dig>  μl of soluble fraction of zymosan  as described  <cit>  and saline-inoculated mosquitoes respectively. dorsal vessels were collected in rnalater  and stored at -80°c. after rnalater removal, total rna was extracted with the rnaeasy kit  and amplified with the smarter pico pcr cdna synthesis kit , and sequenced in a full picotiter plate  using the gs flx titanium platform. primer adaptors used for cdna library generation were trimmed after signal processing using seqclean.  <dig> sequence data was submitted to the sequence read archive  .

illumina sequencing
total rna from  <dig> an. albimanus midguts was extracted using trizol, dnased and cleaned with an rnaeasy column  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. total rna was then quality controlled for integrity on a bioanalyzer . mrna libraries were constructed and sequenced, as previously described  <cit>  on a single lane of a illumina hiseq  <dig>  which generated ~ <dig> million  <dig> bp paired end reads. illumina sequence data was submitted to the sequence read archive  .

assembly
the entire illumina read set was split into eight equal sized read sets. each one of these illumina read sets was merged with the  <dig> and sanger data and assembled using the velvet  <cit>  and oases  <cit>  software packages using three different kmer sizes . the resulting contigs for each assembly were run again through velvet and oases to produce a final assembly. we then filtered the final assembly to retain only those loci that contained a single transcript, that were longer than 300 bp, and that had confidence scores of  <dig> . to address which contigs contained  <dig> or sanger reads, all  <dig> and sanger reads were re-mapped to the initial assembly using the gs reference mapper v. <dig> . <dig> using default parameters. unmapped reads were re-assembled using the gs assembler v <dig> . <dig> on cdna mode to yield an additional set of  <dig> contigs.

genome mapping
the an. gambiae   <cit>  and an. darlingi genomes  <cit>  were softmasked with repeatmasker  <cit> . an. albimanus transcripts were aligned to either genome using exonerate v.  <dig>   <cit>  with the est <dig> genome mode, and a threshold score of  <dig>  and maximum intron length of  <dig>  bp.

transcript annotation
gene ontology annotations were performed using blast2go  <cit> . for the initial blastx against the ncbi-nr database the command-line option “-e1-e-6” was used. additionally, transcripts were annotated according to the interpro databases using interproscan  <cit>  in six-frame translation mode. kruskal-wallis test followed by dunn’s correction was performed to calculate statistical differences within go classes and protein percent identity with the graph pad prism software.

in silico proteome comparison
the entire assembled transcript dataset was used to search for the best hit homologous proteins  in the an. gambiae , ae. aegypti ; culex quinquefasciatus , p. humanus  and ixodes scapularis  predicted proteomes present at vectorbase  <cit> , as well as the an. darlingi <cit>  and d. melanogaster <cit>  proteomes. ortholog prediction was done by performing blastx and tblastn bidirectional comparisons between an. albimanusan. darlingi and an. gambiae  to identify the best reciprocal hits within the three species.

to identify the proportion of the core eukaryotic genome covered by the an. albimanus transcriptome, we used hmm profiles corresponding to the  <dig> core eukaryotic proteins as provided by the cegma algorithm  <cit> . local hmmer <dig> searches  <cit>  were calibrated using the an. gambiae core eukaryotic protein validated dataset consisting of  <dig> sequences  <cit> . hmmer <dig> was performed using hmmscan command and the “-t 40” and “--domt 40” filters against the an. albimanus predicted proteome, as well as the predicted proteomes of an. darlingian. gambiaeae. aegyptic. quinquefasciatus and d. melanogaster.

web interface
many web-based genome browsers  <cit>  are available as open source software and are well suited to displaying transcript annotations. however they are heavily dependent on the availability of a genome sequence to act as a coordinate system. it is possible to adapt genome browsers to work without genomes  <cit>  but it is not easy to keep them synchronized with developments in the “parent” software. in this work, we chose to develop a standalone “genome-free” web application, called gdav . it was designed with flexibility in mind; it can handle any kind of sequence annotations and integrates with genome browsers of closely related species via the das protocol  <cit> . the free open source code is available at https://github.com/vectorbase/gdav and the software was developed within the auspices of vectorbase  <cit> .

the key to gdav’s flexibility is its use of three simple, open text file formats for loading data: fasta for sequences, tab-delimited files for annotations and gff <dig> for genome alignments. only the loading of one or more fasta files is mandatory, thereafter zero or more annotation and alignment files may be loaded into gdav’s small mysql schema using the supplied perl scripts. the annotation file consists of rows of data identified by the sequence id in the first column, and subsequent named columns providing arbitrary text annotations. the java-based web interface is simple to deploy within a java web server such as apache tomcat. the web interface, with its integrated search facility, treats all annotations as plain text—no special treatment of numeric data  is provided. link-outs to third party databases from specific columns containing suitable ids are possible through the configuration file. a java-based das server based on dazzle  <cit>  is bundled with gdav. it can be used to display gff <dig> file-derived gapped alignments  of the sequences stored in gdav with respect to the genomes of one or more closely related species. any alignment features shown via das in genome browsers link back to the sequence report page in gdav.

in this study, the annotation files loaded into the system include the interpro domain assignments and the blastx results providing “best hits” to several other proteomes. the gff3-format exonerate alignments described above were also loaded into the system.
