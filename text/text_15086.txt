BACKGROUND
hepatocellular carcinoma  is the fifth most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide  <cit> . during transformation from dysplastic regenerating hepatocytes to malignant hepatoma cells, several tumor-associated proteins are expressed that potentially could allow immune discrimination of malignant hepatocytes from surrounding non-tumor cells. glypican- <dig> , an oncofetal antigen re-expressed in a high frequency of neoplastic hepatocytes  <cit>  has emerged as a useful immunohistochemical diagnostic test  <cit>  and potential biomarker  <cit>  for hepatocellular carcinoma. glypican- <dig> appears critical for the association of growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor- <dig>  bone morphogenic protein- <dig> and fibroblast growth factor- <dig> with growth factor receptors  <cit>  but also may play an immunomodulatory role  <cit> . inhibition of glypican- <dig> function via knockdown  <cit>  or competition  <cit>  has a profound negative effect on hcc cell line proliferation. unlike any other tumor antigen associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, gpc <dig> is a glycophosphatidylinositiol-linked membrane-associated protein with a large extracellular domain attractive for antibody-directed therapy. an anti-glypican- <dig> murine igg antibody that induces antibody-dependent cytotoxicity has been shown to have anti-tumor effect in a xenograft animal model of hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit>  but required partial humanization before entering human clinical trials  <cit> . thus, while there is a strong rationale for targeting glypican- <dig> for humoral and potentially chimeric immunotherapy for hcc, an scfv of human origin might be less immunogenic and more flexible for incorporation into downstream applications.

a paired yeast display/secretory scfv library derived from immunoglobulin heavy and light chains originally derived from the b-cells of a human patient with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura  <cit>  has been shown to be a powerful tool for the identification of human scfv against surface-expressed human tumor antigens  <cit> . key advantages of this approach include a large repertoire of potential human heavy and light chain pairings, efficient flow cytometric enrichment, eukaryotic-type post-translational modifications, absence of potential xenoreactive sequences and efficient conversion to soluble secreted scfv for validation  <cit> .

in this study, we report our development and validation of multiple human glypican-3-specific scfv. the high throughput methodology identified human-derived scfv with ec <dig> ranging from  <dig>  –  <dig> nm. these scfv bound specifically to glypican-3-expressing cell lines. scfv binding was significantly reduced by shrna knockdown of glypican- <dig>  we believe these scfv are optimal for development for diagnostic and in vivo therapeutic applications.

RESULTS
preparation of target antigen for screening of hgpc3-specific scfv
two target antigens were developed for scfv isolation. first, to specifically target the region between two c-terminal gag modification sites and the hydrophobic putative gpi-linkage domain predicted by an online algorithm  <cit> , we chose a 29mer peptide hgpc3530- <dig> for commercially synthesis in biotinylated and non-biotinylated formats ; however, only a single vh-only scfv labeled g3-c <dig> was obtained using this peptide approach. therefore, we expressed and purified a larger truncated hgpc3368-548-gst fusion protein spanning a larger region of the c-terminus of the protein . purity of the expressed fusion protein was further confirmed by western blot with the 1g <dig> mab. . both the 29mer hgpc3530- <dig> and hgpc3368-548-gst were biotinylated for yeast library screening.

isolation of hgpc3-reactive scfv-displaying yeast
the yeast library was subjected to two rounds of magnetic-sorting using biotinylated hgpc3530- <dig> or three rounds of magnetic-sorting using biotinylated hgpc3368-548-gst to enrich hgpc3-specific scfv-expressing yeast. the third magnetic sort of hgpc3368-548-gst was a depletion sort to eliminate gst-specific scfv-expressing yeast using biotinylated gst. the enriched sub-library was then further enriched for hgpc3-specific scfv-expressing yeast with three rounds of flow sorting selecting for yeast expressing scfv-c-myc and biotinylated antigen at progressively decreasing concentration . streptavidin-pe was used to identify scfv specific for biotinylated target in the first two rounds. neutravidin-pe was utilized in the third round to eliminate selection of streptavidin-specific scfv-expressing yeast . this strategy yielded a marked enrichment of hgpc3-reactive yeast to approximately 30% of the population .

selection of hgpc3-specific scfvs by elisa
the majority of yeast clones obtained after transduction of scfv cdna cloned into a secretory plasmid produced scfv at detectable quantities in supernatant . approximately  <dig> transformed yeast colonies were sub-cultured for high-throughput ni-purification of supernatant. these  <dig> scfv candidates were then assessed for binding to rhgpc <dig> by elisa . in order to eliminate gst-reactive scfv, each scfv candidate was tested in parallel for binding to both gst and rhgpc3-gst. thirty-six scfv candidates with odhgpc3-gst/odgst ratios greater than  <dig>  were selected for further screening . by then testing binding to full-length glycosylated recombinant hgpc <dig> protein expressed in a murine myeloma cell line by elisa , we identified thirteen candidates with odgpc3/odmedia ratio greater than  <dig> 

biological characterization of the scfv candidates
among these thirteen scfvs candidates, eight yeast colonies with varying elisa affinity were chosen for further validation. soluble scfvs were purified from the supernatant by anti-his chromatography resulting in  <dig> - <dig>  mg soluble antibody/liter of culture. by dot blot analysis, all scfv recognized rhgpc <dig> protein with no cross-reactivity with gst protein , confirming elisa findings. nucleotide sequencing of these thirteen scfv yeast colonies revealed five unique sequences, for which 2e <dig>  3e <dig>  3d <dig>  4g <dig>  and 2g <dig> represented one of each clone. the analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence by alignment of scfv heavy and light chain variable region sequence to a database of human immunoglobulin germline sequences  using igblast <cit>  was applied to establish vh and vl gene utilization and heavy-chain cdr composition of the scfv antibodies . the vh domains in scfv 2g <dig> and 4g <dig> and 2e <dig> are vh <dig>  while 3e <dig> and 3d <dig> are vh <dig>  light chains were κ except for the 3e <dig>  the binding affinity for rhgpc <dig> was established by elisa at two concentrations of rhgpc <dig> protein and repeated, with affinity determined by calculation of half maximal binding concentration  using a non-linear regression curve-fit algorithm. the ec <dig> value of scfvs range from 3nm to 105nm. for scfv 3e <dig>  the comparable affinities were measured to be 14nm at the concentration of 1 ug/ml and be 11nm of  <dig>  ug/ml rhgpc <dig> protein .

scfv binding to native hgpc <dig> protein specifically on human cell surface on glypican-3-expressing cell lines
we further test scfv binding to naturally expressed surface hgpc <dig>  multiple scfv including 3e <dig>  2g <dig> and 3d <dig> were complexed with anti-v <dig> apc and incubated with hepg <dig> , 293t  or hs578t  cell lines, which were then washed and assessed by flow cytometry. as shown in figure 5b, all three scfv exhibited a range of binding affinity to endogenous surface-expressed hgpc <dig> on hepg <dig>  while no binding was found on 293t or hs578t cells. many additional scfv candidates failed to bind naturally expressed gpc <dig> including 4c <dig> and 5g <dig> among others . binding was also confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy  using hepg <dig> tdtomato and hs578t.tdtomato cells. the transduction of tdtomatored protein did not alter gpc <dig> expression in hepg <dig> cells . scfv-3e <dig>  2g <dig> and 3d <dig> showed intense membrane immunofluorescence staining with a significant fraction of viable hepg <dig> tdtomato cells. all these data suggested that these three scfvs specifically recognize naturally expressed hgpc <dig> protein and absence of cross-reactivity to other surface proteoglycans.

validation of scfvs’ specificities in rnai-based cell binding
to further confirm the specificity for scfv binding to hgpc <dig>  we utilized gpc3-shrna transduced hepg <dig> cells. silencing was confirmed by co-expressing a plasmid encoding myc-tagged hgpc <dig> with three shrna candidate vectors in 293t cells. sh <dig> showed the best silencing efficiency, reducing hgpc <dig> protein levels up to 80% compared to the scrambled control . sh <dig> was then retrovirally transduced into hepg <dig> cells in a gfp-expressing vector to generate hepg <dig> sh <dig> stable cell line. hepg <dig> sh <dig> markedly reduced surface glypican- <dig> expression by approximately 75% reduction of mfi when detected with 1g <dig> . scfvs including 3e <dig>  2g <dig>  3d <dig>  2e <dig> and 4g <dig> were incubated with hepg <dig> and hepg <dig> sh <dig> cells, respectively, and detected by apc-labeled anti-v <dig> mab. as shown in figure 6d, significant reduction of binding between hepg <dig> and hepg <dig> sh <dig> cells was observed with scfv-3e <dig>  2g <dig> and 3d <dig>  while the staining with scfv-2e <dig> and 4g <dig> had no detectable differences . these findings were confirmed by immunofluorescence staining in which a 1: <dig> mixture of hepg <dig> and hepg <dig> sh <dig> cells were stained with scfv . cell membrane staining by scfvs was profoundly reduced in hepg <dig> sh <dig> relative to wild-type hepg <dig> cells.

glypican-3-specific scfv are not cytostatic
to determine if scfv binding to membrane-associated glypican- <dig> alters cellular proliferation, we performed a standard mtt assay after validation of the accuracy of mtt to measure proliferation of hepg <dig> cells . as shown in figure 7b, no positive or negative impact on proliferation of the glypican-3-expressing hepg <dig> cell line was detected with any scfv at high concentration .

discussion
therapeutic options for hepatocellular carcinoma  remain limited particularly in advanced stages. immunotherapy with nk- or t-cell augmenting therapies to date has yielded some early promising results  <cit>  but the low affinity of endogenous tumor-specific t-cell receptors and the immunosuppressive milieu of the tumor microenvironment represent barriers to effectively harnessing the power of the endogenous immune system to control cancer. yeast-derived scfv offer many advantageous properties for the development of anti-tumor biologics. scfv are inexpensive to produce, easily modifiable e.g. biotinylation  <cit> , and facile for subsequent cloning in cis with diagnostic or effector domains.

identification of an appropriate tumor–associated antigen is an obviously essential requirement for scfv development. glypican- <dig> , a heparan-sulfate proteoglycan, has recently been identified as a highly specific, membrane-associated tumor antigen found in 49-100% of hcc  <cit> . gpc <dig> is not expressed  in non-tumorous cirrhotic liver tissue  <cit>  and expression of gpc <dig> in other normal tissues appears limited  <cit> . gpc <dig> modulates the effect of growth factors such as igf- <dig>  bmp- <dig> and fgf- <dig> on hepatoma cells  <cit>  and may recruit m <dig> tumor-promoting macrophages to the hcc microenvironment  <cit> . emerging evidence also suggests that inhibition of glypican- <dig> function via knockdown  <cit>  or competition  <cit>  has a profound negative effect on hcc proliferation. expression on the cell surface makes gpc <dig> an attractive target for antibody-directed therapy. another group has shown that a murine anti-hgpc <dig> antibody induces antibody-dependent cytotoxicity that manifests an anti-tumor effect in a xenograft animal model of hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit> ; this antibody has subsequently been humanized  <cit>  and is entering human clinical trials. thus, available evidence suggests that glypican- <dig> is a rational target for humoral and potentially chimeric immunotherapy for hcc.

in this study, we utilized the paired display/secretion yeast system to isolate five candidate scfv with affinity in the range from  <dig>  –  <dig>  nm that each demonstrate specificity for binding the surface of glypican-3-expressing cell lines. scfv binding was significantly reduced after specific knockdown of glypican- <dig>  the paired yeast display/secretion system minimizes post-translational and conformational changes in the conversion from displayed to soluble scfvs, a property that allows for consistency during the high throughput screening and validation process  <cit> . scfv specificity to the naturally processed glypican- <dig> protein at physiological conditions was critical given complex post-translational modifications of glypican- <dig>  we utilized increasingly physiological screening criteria to select scfv candidates for further evaluation. dramatic differences of scfv binding between wild-type and glypican-3-knockdown hepg <dig> in cell culture conditions confirmed not only the specificity of scfv binding but also the capacity to bind to naturally-processed cell surface glypican- <dig> in situ. in separate work, we are currently validating a chimeric antigen receptor to redirect t-cells against glypican-3-expressing targets using our 3e <dig> scfv.

not surprisingly, scfv had no direct positive or negative impact on cellular proliferation unlike that demonstrated by soluble glypican- <dig>  <cit> . the relatively small size of scfv  makes competitive inhibition of growth factor binding unlikely. we did not include agonism or antagonism in our screening strategy, and thus lack of agonist and antagonistic effect is not unexpected. conjugation of our scfv to cellular cytotoxins will be explored as a potential therapeutic application of the scfv technology.

CONCLUSIONS
glypican- <dig> is a rational target in hepatocellular carcinoma for antibody-based therapy. utilizing a recently described paired display/secretory yeast library to isolate human-derived scfv against glypican- <dig>  five unique scfv with affinity ranging from  <dig> - <dig> nm were identified. each scfv in vitro demonstrated strong surface binding to glypican-3-expressing cell lines that was attenuated by shrna knockdown, and did not bind glypican-3-nonexpressing cell lines. ongoing work is characterizing the in vitro and in vivo application of these scfv in chimeric antigen receptor technology for hepatocellular carcinoma.
