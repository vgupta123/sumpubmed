BACKGROUND
regulation of gene expression is obligatorily dependent on the structure of chromatin that is dynamically remodeled via posttranslational modifications  of its histone and non-histone constituents  <cit> . reversible lysine acetylation represents a common modification of proteins that is carried out by histone acetyl transferases  and histone deacetylases . the acetylation of histones leads to de-condensation of chromatin that becomes accessible to transcriptional machinery; in contrast, the inert chromatin is enriched in deacetylated histones  <cit> . consistent with chromatin structure-dependent activation of gene expression, many transcriptional co-activators  possess hat activity whereas transcriptional co-repressors are associated with hdacs. since dna-binding domains are invariably missing from hats and hdacs, they are recruited to their target promoters and enhancers via protein-protein interactions  <cit> .

the hdacs represent an ancient super-family of enzymes conserved from yeast to man. the mammalian hdacs are divided into the “classical family” of  <dig> zinc-dependent hydrolases and the “non-classical family” of seven nad+-dependent hdacs called sirtuins. based on their phylogeny, domain organization and sub-cellular localization, the mammalian hdacs are further split into four sub-classes  <cit> . the hdac members of class i  contain a central deacetylase domain surrounded by short nh <dig> and cooh termini. class i hdacs are mainly localized in the nucleus and possess potent enzymatic activity toward histones. six members of class ii are further sub-grouped into class iia  and class iib , based on whether they possess one or two catalytic sites, respectively  <cit> . the class iv consists of a solitary member hdac <dig>  with homologies to rpd <dig> and hda <dig> proteins of yeast. finally, sirtuins, the nad-dependent lysine deacetylases, belong to class iii  <cit> .

the actions of hats and hdacs are intimately involved in the mechanisms of cardiac and skeletal muscle gene expression  <cit> . a number of studies have demonstrated a positive therapeutic potential of hdacis in animal models of cardiac hypertrophy. the pan-hdacis are thought to attenuate pathological cardiac hypertrophy via their ability to alter chromatin structure and gene expression in the heart, and in primary cultures of cardiac myocytes  <cit> . it is believed that by perturbing the epigenetic landscape of chromatin, the pan-hdac inhibitors exert genome-wide changes in both myocytes as well as other cell lineages in the intact heart. however, the molecular underpinning of the altered gene expression in myocytes versus non-myocyte cells in the intact heart treated with pan-hdacis is poorly understood. the batch-to-batch variability that is encountered in cardiac myocytes in primary cultures makes them less suitable to answer this question with rigor.

the h9c <dig> cells have emerged as an excellent in vitro alternative to primary cardiac myocytes. although lacking the elaborate contractile apparatus of bona fide cardiac myocytes, h9c <dig> cells elicit robust hypertrophy-associated signature of fetal gene expression in response to angiotensin ii, phenylephrine and il-18; additionally, akin to what occurs in the intact heart, pathological hypertrophy of h9c <dig> cardiac myocytes could be attenuated by pan-hdac inhibitors, tsa and cbha  <cit> . this study was undertaken with an objective to determine genome-wide responses of h9c <dig> cardiac myocytes to two distinct pan-hdacis. we exposed h9c <dig> cells to either cbha or tsa for  <dig> and  <dig> h and analyzed their transcriptomes by whole-genome illumina microarrays. we also subjected the differentially expressed genes of h9c <dig> cells, induced by cbha and tsa treatments, to theoretical analyses using ingenuity pathway analysis , kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  and core_tf software programs. our data revealed that although cbha and tsa elicited unique signatures of gene expression at 6h and 24h time points, both hdacis suppressed a number of common gene networks putatively involved in pro-inflammatory causes and consequences of pathological cardiac hypertrophy.

RESULTS
h9c <dig> cardiac myocytes constitutively express all major hdacs and sirtuins
we have shown previously that il-18-induced pathological hypertrophy in the intact heart and in h9c <dig> cells were attenuated by tsa and cbha that caused hyper-acetylation of histones in the chromatin both in vivo and in vitro <cit> . modification of histones by pan-hdac inhibitors are mediated by their ability to inhibit class i and ii hdacs; pan-hdac inhibitors do not affect sirtuins  <cit> . since the status of expression of various hdacs in h9c <dig> cells in not known, we began these studies by assessing the expression and sub-cellular localization of various hdacs and sirtuins in h9c <dig> cells. as shown in the representative western blots , although mono-specific antibodies readily detected all major hdacs and sirtuins their relative expression and subcellular localizations in the extracts of h9c <dig> cells were quite different. for example, hdac- <dig>  hdac- <dig>  hdac- <dig>  hdac- <dig> and hdac- <dig> are mainly localized in the nucleus of h9c <dig> cells that elicit nearly equal expression of hdac- <dig> and hdac- <dig> in their cytoplasm and nuclei. evidently, whereas sirtuin- <dig>  sirtuin- <dig>  sirtuin- <dig> and sirtuin- <dig> are primarily localized in the nucleus, sirtuin- <dig> and sirtuin- <dig> are seen mainly in the cytoplasm. finally, sirtuin- <dig> seems to be equally distributed in both cellular compartments . these data suggest that the subcellular compartmentalization of hdacs and sirtuins in the h9c <dig> cardiac myocytes is similar to that found in many other cells  <cit> .

we also quantified steady state levels of cognate mrnas of various hdacs and situins in h9c <dig> cells by qpcr. as shown in table  <dig>  h9c <dig> cells expressed hdac- <dig> and hdac- <dig> specific mrnas most abundantly, followed by transcripts encoding hdac-3>hdac-7>hdac-6>hdac- <dig>  similar qpcr analyses revealed that the constitutive expression of sirtuin- <dig> specific mrna was the highest in h9c <dig> cells that also expressed sirtuin-5> sirtuin-6> sirtuin-7> sirtuin-3>sirtuin-1>sirtuin- <dig> specific mrnas . based on these and additional quantifications we surmised that there was a close correspondence between hdac and sirtuin proteins and their cognate mrnas. additionally, we observed that exposure of h9c <dig> cells to the either pan-hdac inhibitor affected neither the expression  nor sub-cellular distribution of hdacs or sirtuins .

* qpcr was carried out on total rna extracted from h9c <dig> cells grown in serum free or serum supplemented media. expression levels were calculated from δcp values from  <dig> replicate determinations. expression levels of various hdacs were compared to hdac  <dig> fixed at 1: similarly fold-changes in the expression of sirtuins were established against sirtuin  <dig> whose expression was fixed at  <dig> 

pan-hdac inhibitors alter global gene expression profiles of h9c <dig> cells
the main aim of our study was to examine the effect of hdacis on gene expression in cardiac myocytes without other cell types  that coexist in the intact heart. we serum-starved h9c <dig> cells for 16-24h before initiating drug treatment by incubating the cells in complete growth medium  and growth media supplemented with cbha or tsa. based on our empirical assessment of the actions of hdacis in “cell cycle-synchronized” h9c <dig> cells, in the presence or absence of il- <dig>  <cit> , we believe that 6h and 24h time points of treatment will yield snapshots of genome-wide actions of cbha and tsa during early and late stages of cell cycle. messenger rnas extracted from six replicates of each treatment cohort were processed for hybridization to illumina rat microarrays and subsequent analysis. we filtered the gene expression dataset through the criteria of absolute 2-fold change and p value of < <dig>  before analyzing these data by principal component analysis  and the un-supervised hierarchical clustering methods. as shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  the cohorts  of vehicle-treated h9c <dig> cells harvested at 6h and 24h occupy close, albeit unique positions in the pca graph. similarly, the replicates of cbha- or tsa-treated cells harvested at 6h and  <dig> h after treatment are also uniquely grouped in the pca graph.

the ratref- <dig> expression beadchip contains about  <dig>  genes. exposure of h9c <dig> cells to tsa and cbha led to a total of  <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed genes, respectively. it appears therefore that the expression of approximately 3% and 6% of genes were significantly affected in h9c <dig> cells in response to tsa and cbha, respectively. based on their temporal expression characteristics and quantification of their expression levels, the tsa- and cbha-responsive genes could be organized into six distinct clusters, a through f . the sizes of clusters c and f elicited in tsa-treated cells were much larger compared with their counterpart clusters in cbha-treated cells. this is in contrast to what occurred in h9c <dig> cells treated with cbha that induced more numerous transcripts belonging to clusters b, d and e. as depicted in figure  <dig>  tsa elicited differential expression of  <dig> and  <dig> genes at 6h and 24h post-treatment, respectively. an identical exposure of h9c <dig> cells to cbha for 6h and 24h elicited  <dig> and  <dig> degs, respectively.

ingenuity pathway analysis indicates that cbha and tsa perturb overlapping yet distinct gene networks in h9c <dig> cardiac myocytes
we began our gene network studies with the reasoning that interrogation of the maximum numbers of degs by ipa would reveal the most robust networks involved in the actions of tsa or cbha. therefore, at first, we merged all degs contained in clusters a through f into a single dataset. however, we discovered that the combined dataset was too large for an optimal analysis by the ipa program and thus, with a goal to reduce the number of degs that could be assessed by ipa, we re-filtered the tsa- and cbha-responsive degs through more stringent statistical criteria. we set an absolute  <dig> -fold change and p value of < <dig>  for tsa-responsive genes; similarly, cbha-responsive genes were re-filtered through an absolute  <dig> -fold change and a p value of < <dig> . these statistical maneuvers reduced tsa-regulated genes to  <dig> and  <dig>  at 6h and 24h post treatment. of these,  <dig> genes were up regulated  at 6h and  <dig> genes down regulated . at 24h treatment  <dig> genes were up regulated  and  <dig> genes were down regulated . a more stringent statistical analysis yielded  <dig> and  <dig> genes for cbha treatment at 6h and 24h, respectively. at 6h treatment of cbha  <dig> genes were up regulated  and  <dig> genes down-regulated . at 24h treatment  <dig> genes were up regulated  and  <dig> genes were down regulated .

the initial analysis of the merged datasets by ipa revealed that although cbha and tsa elicited unique signatures of gene expression, the two pan-hdac inhibitors also impinged on numerous common gene targets at 6h  and 24h  post-treatment . we also observed that genes in clusters a through c were generally up regulated by both hdacis; in contrast, expression of most of the mrnas contained in clusters d through f was repressed by both cbha and tsa .

next, we combined the top seven ipa networks of tsa-specific degs at 6h and 24h to reveal the hierarchy of the potential gene networks in the actions of the two pan-hdacis . the degs seen after 6h treatment with tsa revealed the existence of tgfβ  tnf-α  and ifnγ  specific gene networks . these cytokine hubs were connected with signaling kinases such as pten-pi3k-akt  and mapk , and transcription factors ,  and . we should note here that the inflammatory cytokine hubs are connected to genes that were either induced or suppressed by tsa . thus, tnf-α specific hub was connected to hdac- <dig>  cardiotrophin, myod and myogenin, all of which were down regulated; in contrast, the expression of geminin  was induced by tsa . similarly, the ifnγ specific hub is connected to both tsa-inducible  and tsa-suppressible  genes. finally, pten specific hub is connected to two microtubule-associated kinases mast <dig> and limk <dig> that were up regulated by tsa and a transcription factor  that was down regulated in tsa-treated h9c <dig> cells post 6h treatment. these data are consistent with our earlier report showing that the expression of pten was highly induced by cbha in h9c <dig> cells  <cit>  and in response to both cbha and tsa in the intact heart  <cit> .

*degs in response to tsa treatment of h9c <dig> cells for  <dig> and  <dig> h were subject to ipa as detailed in “material and methods”. gene pathways with total number of connections  and focus genes are hierarchically arranged according to the number of focus genes. the relative order of the p53-specific network elicited at  <dig> h  and  <dig> h  is mechanistically significant.

*degs in response to cbha were subject to ipa as detailed in “material and methods”. gene pathway with total number of connections  and focus genes are hierarchically arranged according to the number of focus genes. the relative position of the p53-specific network elicited at  <dig> h  and  <dig> h  is significant.

a continued exposure to tsa for 24h led to apparent consolidation of the tgfβ  and tnf-α  specific gene networks . however, in contrast to a dominant involvement of pten-pi3k-akt signaling seen at 6h , at 24h, mapk signaling  connected with tgfβ and tnf-α specific hubs was prominent. there were also unique signal transduction and transcription factor specific networks elicited by tsa at  <dig> h; thus in addition to hnf4a, tsa strongly induced ap1-jun/fos , p <dig>  and cyclin-dependent kinases . at 24h treatment, tnf-αspecific gene networks were associated with regulators of cell cycle , chromatin architecture and transcription ; tsa down regulated all these mrnas. these gene network analyses are consistent with the hypothesis that tsa blunted the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic actions of tnf-α and tgfβ.

evidently the signaling and transcriptional regulatory gene networks elicited in cbha-treated h9c <dig> cells for 6h or 24h also evolved with treatment duration . the ipa of degs of cells treated for 6h with cbha revealed the existence of tnf-α  and ifnγ  specific gene networks . these two cytokine hubs were connected with pten-pi3k-akt , mapk , and transcription factors . we should note however, that although pten-pi3k-akt and mapk signaling molecules were robustly elicited by both cbha and tsa, the cytokine specific networks induced by the two hdacis were significantly different in detail. for example, while tsa preferentially elicited tgfβ-intensive gene networks both at 6h and 24h, cbha treatment elicited strong tnf-α and ifnγ specific networks at 6h whereas cells exposed for 24h induced il- <dig>  and ifnγ-centered  hubs. strong cdkn-specific  and p53-specific  gene networks  were also seen in cbha-treated cells at 24h.

a number of unique and shared features of the two pan-hdacis are worth mentioning here. first, the tnf-α specific networks seen in cbha-treated cells at 6h were similar to those seen in tsa-treated cells; in both cases tnf-α specific hubs were directly connected with myod, myog, hdac  <dig>  serpinb <dig> genes, all of which were down regulated . second, the pten specific gene network, connected to genes that were either induced  or suppressed  by cbha, was only seen at 6h after cbha treatment. third, the tp <dig> gene network was more prominent in chba-treated cells at 24h  compared with that seen in tsa-treated cells after 24h. fourth, numerous degs involved in the regulation of cell cycle, chromatin remodeling and mrna metabolism were affected by tsa and cbha. finally, it is significant to note that the pro-inflammatory ifnγ and il- <dig> specific gene networks were connected mainly to down regulated genes involved in dna replication cell cycle cell cycle  in cbha-treated cells at 24h.

ingenuity pathway analyses of six unique clusters of degs corroborate and extend the tsa- and cbha-inducible gene networks seen in the combined dataset
as outlined above, the merged dataset was devoid of a large number of degs that were contained in clusters a through f. therefore, to carry out a more comprehensive network analysis with a goal to corroborate and extend ipa of the merged dataset, we analyzed clusters a through f  individually . these analyses revealed that, irrespective of the hdaci or the duration of the treatment, clusters a, b and c were populated by genes that regulate intracellular signaling, cellular energetics, inflammation and proliferation and apoptosis. the tsa-responsive clusters a-c at 6h  or  <dig> h  elicited prominent tnf-α, hnf-4a, ifnγ yy <dig>  egr <dig>  e2f, and tp <dig> specific nodes that are connected to gene networks involved in metabolic regulation, cellular energetics and proliferation and apoptosis . cbha-responsive clusters a-c at 6h  or  <dig> h  elicited tnf-α ifnγ, nfκb, yy <dig>  e2f and tp <dig> connected with molecules known to regulate immunity, inflammation, intermediary metabolism, and cell growth . only clusters depicting strong networks are shown. majority of the genes in clusters a-c are up regulated by tsa or cbha irrespective of the duration of treatment .

the genes in clusters d, e and f were repressed by both pan-hdacis, regardless of the duration of treatment . as compared to tsa, cbha elicited a much larger cluster d in h9c <dig> cells . cluster d was populated by genes known to control organization and replication of dna , cell cycle  and skeletal muscle structure . regardless of the duration of treatment, both cbha- and tsa-responsive cluster d genes formed strong p <dig>  yy <dig> and cyclin-cdk specific networks . the regulators of nuclear organization , cell cycle  and apoptosis  dominated clusters e and f of cells treated with either pan-hdac inhibitor, irrespective of the duration of treatment. however, the strongest networks in tsa-responsive genes were demonstrated in clusters f involving tnf-α, il- <dig> and ifn-γ at  <dig> and 24h . the cbha-responsive genes demonstrated strong networks in clusters e and formed tnf-α-, ifn-γ-, tp53- and cyclins/cdk specific gene networks at  <dig> and  <dig> h . we may sum up the results of ipa of clusters a through f individually by concluding that these analyses not only validated the prediction of ipa of the combined dataset, but also unraveled the existence of additional gene networks. thus, in addition to the existence of gene networks representing cytokines , signal transduction pathways  and transcription factors , the ipa of the degs in the clusters a through f unraveled the putative involvement of egr <dig>  yy <dig>  e2f, and stat <dig> specific gene networks in the actions of the two pan-hdac inhibitors.

kegg analysis of differentially expressed genes induced by cbha and tsa
to extend the in silico examination of the differentially regulated genes by ipa, we subjected degs that were common to tsa and cbha to kegg analysis. the kegg program is designed to convert the molecular interactions and gene networks into biologically functional pathways . the kegg analysis revealed that cbha and tsa elicited a number of overlapping pathways, regardless of the duration of the treatment . thus, phosphatidylinositol metabolism and signaling and mapk pathways were preeminent in h9c <dig> cells exposed to either tsa or cbha at 6h. furthermore, the putative pten-pi3k-akt/pkb signaling pathways were connected with numerous genes involved in the metabolism of pyruvate, citrate and amino acids, as well as in the intermediary metabolism of purines and pyrimidines . the emergence of gene networks known to regulate cell cycle and dna replication, metabolism of xenobiotics, oxidative stress and extracellular matrix were also common in h9c <dig> cells incubated with either cbha or tsa for 24h . based on these observations we surmise that similar hdaci-induced gene networks were uncovered by ipa and kegg analyses.

*the kegg pathways associated with the common gene set affected by tsa or cbha at 6h and 24h post-treatment in h9c <dig> cells are hierarchically arranged based on the number of common degs and the significance of enrichment  derived as described in “material and methods”.

a putative involvement of mapk pathways in the action of pan-hdac inhibitors
the network analyses of genes that were differentially regulated by cbha and tsa, regardless of whether it was done by ipa or kegg programs, strongly predicted a role of pten-pi3k-akt/pkb and mapk signaling pathways in the actions of hdacis. we reported earlier that both cbha and tsa potently induced the expression of pten and concomitant reduction in pi3k and akt phosphorylation in h9c <dig> cells as well as in the intact heart  <cit> . to test a potential role of map kinases, we extracted proteins from h9c <dig> cells incubated with cbha or tsa for various time intervals and assessed the steady state levels of total and phosphorylated erk, jnk and p <dig> mapk. as shown in figure  <dig>  an exposure to tsa for 4h led to a reduced phosphorylation of erk  and its phosphorylation remained inhibited until 24h. tsa treatment also significantly suppressed phosphorylation of p <dig>  as early as 2h. finally, an exposure of h9c <dig> cells to cbha resulted in a reduction of perk at 4h, while the levels of p-p <dig> kinase were not significantly affected by cbha. the temporal changes in the regulation of jnk in response to cbha or tsa were inconclusive . finally, it should be noted that neither tsa nor cbha altered the steady state levels of total erk or p <dig> kinases .

frequency of putative transcription factor binding sites in differentially expressed genes in response to cbha and tsa
with an aim to elucidate potentially common pathways involved in the induction of genes by cbha and tsa, we extended gene network analyses by an in silico examination of transcription factor binding sites  in the promoters of degs. we explored  <dig> kb of dna upstream of transcription start site of all differentially expressed genes by core_tf, a web-based program that identifies dominant tfbs. as shown in table  <dig>  in degs induced by cbha at  <dig> and 24h, the topmost transcriptional factor motifs were those of ap <dig>  chch, e2f <dig>  egr <dig> and etf. an over-representation of ap <dig>  chch, e2f <dig>  egr <dig> and etf was also seen in tsa-treated cells; additionally, the promoters of the tsa-induced degs expressed zinc finger-containing transcription factors . finally, nf-y specific motifs were overrepresented in degs induced by tsa at 24h. the preponderance of e2f <dig>  egr <dig>  sp <dig> and krox transcription factor binding sites in the degs induced by either pan-hdac inhibitor was consistent with an ability of these transcription factors to regulate genes involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis. the members of the e2f family, that bind to rb <dig>  also play a key role in regulating g to s transition; similarly, nf-y has a fundamental role in the expression of genes that regulate g2/m phase of the cell cycle.

discussion
we report here a comprehensive analysis of gene networks in h9c <dig> cells induced in response to two distinct pan-hdac inhibitors, tsa and cbha that have been shown to attenuate cardiac hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro <cit> . although h9c <dig> cells differ from bona fide cardiac myocytes in their inability to elicit well-defined sarcomeres, they elicit a pathological hypertrophy-specific gene expression program in response to angiotensis ii, il- <dig> and phenylephrine. furthermore, pan-hdac inhibitors alleviated the hypertrophy response of h9c <dig> cells as judged by their molecular phenotype  <cit> . we show that both pan-hdacis induced intracellular energetics and pro-inflammatory cytokine specific gene networks that were connected with canonical signaling kinases  and transcription factors  with a widespread potential to regulate the metabolic phenotype, proliferation and death.

in silico analysis of degs by ipa and kegg programs indicated that the synthesis and turnover of phosphatidylinositol bis- and tris-phosphates  and their receptors played a prominent role in the actions of cbha and tsa. our observations corroborate and extend earlier results showing that pan-hdac inhibitors blunt the pi3k-akt signaling by at least two different mechanisms  <cit> . first, it has been reported that tsa blocked interactions of protein phosphatase- <dig> with hdacs  <dig> and 6; this led to increased dephosphorylation of pakt. secondly, we have demonstrated that pan-hdacis cbha and tsa opposed pi3k-akt signaling via inducing pten gene expression in cardiac myocytes as well in the intact hearts. based on the network analysis shown here we speculate that pten-specific gene networks regulate cell cycle and growth via plk <dig>  cdc <dig>  mast <dig> and limk <dig> kinases.

an extensive review of the literature indicates that hdacis are capable of blunting the inflammatory response in a number of pathological settings  <cit> . apparently, several signaling kinases, including mapks, participate in the anti-inflammatory actions of pan-hdacis. it is significant therefore that both cbha and tsa inhibited the activation of erk and tsa inhibited phosphorylation of p <dig> mapk in h9c <dig> cells in a time dependent manner. earlier observations have also shown that pi3k and mapk signaling are engaged in extensive crosstalk in the patho-physiology of the heart  <cit> . the activation of erk via phosphorylation was associated with neoplastic transformation that was inhibited by tsa  <cit> . similarly, tsa could also block the activation of erk signaling induced by tgf-β  <cit> .

we have reported previously that cbha induced hyper-acetylation of histone h <dig>  and inhibited its phosphorylation  in il- <dig> treated cells  <cit> . both cbha and tsa elicited similar posttranslational modifications of histones in the cardiac chromatin  <cit> . it has been suggested by saccani and coauthors that p <dig> dependent phosphorylation of histone h <dig> may mark promoters for increased nf-kb recruitment  <cit> . based on our limited analysis of changes in the phposphorylatin and acetylation of p <dig> subunit of nfkb in h9c <dig> cell treated with cbha or tsa , we posit that both hdacis could alter nf-kb recruitment to selected chromatin targets in these cells. these data must be tempered with caution and precise link between nfkb and suppression of anti-inflammatory gene networks by cbha and tsa remains in the realm of speculation. this is because the regulation of nfkb, consisting of dimeric permutations of c-rel, rela, relb, p <dig>  and p <dig> subunits, via acetylation is highly complex and context-dependent  <cit> .

the cardinal features of maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy include  a major shift from fatty acid to glucose oxidation as the main source of fuel  <cit> ,  increased size and contractility of myocytes, and  excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix and fibrosis  <cit> . the induction of tnf-α ifnγ, il- <dig>  and tgfβ specific gene networks in the cardiac myocytes in response to tsa and cbha suggests that hdacis are capable of interfering with cell proliferation , pro-inflammatory  <cit>  and pro-fibrotic  <cit>  mechanisms. both ipa and kegg analyses also unraveled a striking effect of hdacis on the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, amino acids, purines and pyrimidines, as well as on the metabolism of glutathione and xenobiotics. the potential reprogramming of gene expression by hdacis to elicit the gene networks observed here would be expected to alleviate metabolic consequences of pathological cardiac hypertrophy.

recent observations have demonstrated that pan-hdacis not only enhance acetylation of histones, but also of numerous other proteins that include transcription factors and enzymes involved in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and fat and glycogen metabolism  <cit> . with regard to the phenotypic changes seen in h9c <dig> cells treated with cbha and tsa, it is evident that the signaling cascades induced by both hdacis culminated in the nucleus to re-program expression of genes that control growth and differentiation  and architecture  of cardiac myocytes. it was also evident that both cbha and tsa impinged on a number of common transcription factors myc, p <dig>  hnf4a and nfkb  and e2f, egr <dig>  ap <dig>  and etf , that are known to modulate the expression of genes that regulate s, g and m phases of the cell cycle  <cit> . a role of nfkb in the protection of cardiac myocytes from inflammatory signals, both in vitro and in vivo is well established; hdacis are known to regulate nfkb signaling  <cit> .

we should note that in silico predictions of the ipa and core_tf programs with respect to the putative transcription factors are limited in two ways. first, these analyses only provide a snapshot of transcription at 6h and 24h and need to be extended on both sides of the timescale used here. second, the exact dynamics of induction of various tfs need to be experimentally validated. with these caveats notwithstanding, it is noteworthy that the preponderance of the tfs involved in the regulation of gene expression in response to tsa or cbha were not identical. thus, the ipa predicted hnf4a, myc, p <dig> and nfkb to be the dominant transcription factors; in contrast, the core_tf program predicted the preponderance of e2f <dig>  ap <dig>  egr <dig>  etf, sp <dig> and krox. these apparently dissimilar predictions of tfbs that mediate epigenetic regulation of degs likely reflect the uniqueness of the two programs. the ipa assigns nodes in gene network using focus molecules and their known relationships based on published observations stored in the ingenuity pathways knowledge base. in contrast core_tf program uses the focus genes exclusively and directly interrogates their promoters for tfbs. nevertheless, both ipa and core_tf programs give complementary information on the common biological processes  by pan-hdac inhibitors. the known regulatory interrelationships among the dominant tfs predicted by ipa and core_tf support this notion. for instance, nfkb is known to interact with the regulatory regions of myc and cyclin d <dig>  both critical components of cell cycle regulation. similarly, myc regulates the expression of e2f via cyclin d <dig>  a differential expression of p <dig> and cdkna predicted by ipa is highly significant. the regulation of p <dig> expression is mechanistically linked to e2f , cdks and cyclins. the p <dig> also forms a prominent network that directly connects it to p <dig> and cyclin d <dig> both of which are involved in the regulation of e2f, nf-y and etf transcription factors. finally, it should be noted that cyclins, ccna <dig>  cdc <dig> and herpud <dig> are bona fide targets of nf-y regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
based on these data we conclude that pan-hdac inhibitors impinge on a number of key regulatory gene networks to profoundly alter the phenotype of h9c <dig> cardiac myocytes to facilitate their survival in the face of potential inflammatory pathways evoked by pro hypertrophy agents . the cytokine-specific gene networks, signaling pathways and transcription factors putatively perturbed by pan-hdac inhibitors reported here provide a potential platform to test a number of hypotheses related to the known specificity and toxicity of pan-hdac inhibitors in vitro and in vivo <cit> .
