BACKGROUND
eukaryotes normally possess three nuclear dna-dependent rna polymerases , pol i-iii, functionally specialized for synthesis of different types of rna and thus essential for viability. the pol holoenzymes consist of about  <dig> subunits, of which the two largest are tightly bound and together constitute the catalytic seat of the enzyme and are generally polymerase-type specific  <cit> . angiosperms  are unique in possessing two additional rna polymerases that are not essential for viability, pol iv and pol v . they are functionally distinct, with pol iv being required for  <dig> nt sirna production and pol v for sirna-mediated gene silencing of transposons and other repeated elements  <cit> .

the subunit nomenclature of nuclear rna polymerases has varied among research groups and organisms, and is often in conflict with names for unrelated genes. in the following, we have therefore adopted the 4-letter gene names registered with the arabidopsis information resource. by convention the largest subunits of pol i, ii, iii, iv and v are nrpa <dig>  nrpb <dig>  nrpc <dig>  nrpd <dig> and nrpe <dig> respectively, and the genes encoding these are nrpa <dig>  nrpb <dig>  nrpc <dig>  nrpd <dig> and nrpe <dig>  respectively. likewise, the genes encoding the second-largest subunits of the five polymerases are designated nrpa <dig>  nrpb <dig>  nrpc <dig>  nrpd <dig> and nrpe <dig>  respectively.

the genes encoding the largest and second-largest subunits of pol iv, nrpd <dig> and nrpd <dig> respectively, originated by independent duplication of their pol ii homologs, nrpb <dig> and nrpb <dig>  the nrpb1/nrpd <dig> duplication is shared by both charophytes and embryophytes while the nrpb2/nrpd <dig> duplication is found only in embryophytes  <cit> . while pol iv is found in all plants, pol v appears to exist only in angiosperms  following duplication of, at least, the largest subunit gene  basally in this lineage  <cit> . a recent study in the eudicot angiosperm arabidopsis thaliana confirms the close relationship of pol iv and pol v with pol ii and shows that many of their  <dig> subunits are shared among these three rna polymerases  <cit> . nevertheless,  <dig> subunits of pol iv and  <dig> subunits of pol v are distinct from their pol ii paralogs, and pol iv and pol v differ in  <dig> subunits. interestingly,  <dig> duplicated pol iv/v genes  appear to be incompletely subfunctionalized with respect to pol iv and pol v. these have a higher sequence similarity than the fully specialized gene pairs  and are presumably derived from more recent duplication events.

following the duplication and specialization of the pol iv/v largest subunit genes  in angiosperms, duplication of the second-largest subunit genes  seems comparatively rare. nrpd2/e <dig> is apparently a singleton in monocots  as well as in several families of eudicots, e.g., aceraceae , asteraceae , lamiaceae , myrtaceae , solanaceae  and vitaceae   <cit> . a few eudicot lineages, however, possess duplicate nrpd2/e <dig> copies, e.g., brassicaceae , caprifoliaceae , celastraceae , euphorbiaceae , salicaceae , caryophyllaceae  and violaceae   <cit> . this indicates that duplicated nrpd2/e <dig> genes may in fact be a common feature in eudicots. it is clear that the nrpd2/e <dig> duplications have occurred independently in these lineages, and that they are also frequently lost, with sorting among lineages as a common result  <cit> .

the mechanisms behind gene duplication are well known in eukaryotes and in plants . while it is clear that by far the most likely fate of a duplicate gene is gene death  <cit> , mechanisms accounting for the duplications being retained in the genome have been, until recently, less well understood  <cit> . duplicate genes may be preserved by a neutral mechanism in which each paralog accumulates loss-of-function mutations  that are complemented by the other copy. such mutations can happen either at the regulatory level, causing the paralogs to diverge in pattern of expression   <cit> ), or at the product level, causing the paralogs to diverge in function . furthermore, either mechanism can eliminate possible structural trade-offs imposed by different functions performed by a multifunctional gene  <cit> , by unlinking these functions. these mechanisms can thus be regarded as prerequisites for the ability of duplicate genes to specialize and acquire new functions . regulatory and functional subfunctionalization are both well-documented in gene families, in eukaryotes in general as well as in plants .

the rna polymerase subunit encoded by nrpd2/e <dig>  nrpd2/nrpe <dig>  has a discrete double function in angiosperms, assembling either with pol iv or with pol v. a duplication of this gene might have been preserved if the two paralogs underwent subfunctionalization with respect to pol type, and would have required some degree of co-evolution of co-assembling subunits.

in this study we have investigated the evolution of nrpd2/e2-like genes within the violaceae , with particular reference to the genus viola . this gene occurs in a single copy in most genera of the family but it is duplicated in others . in a similar system within tribe sileneae of the caryophyllaceae , concerted evolution was found to be prominent among nrpd2/e <dig> paralogs  <cit> . in that study, however, only intron  <dig> was investigated. in order to be able to examine possible neofunctionalization among nrpd2/e2-like duplicants in the violaceae system, we have expanded this range to include also the flanking exons of intron  <dig> 

the violaceae consist of some  <dig> species in  <dig> mostly tropical genera  <cit> . their relationships have recently been examined in a phylogenetic study based on plastid and nuclear ribosomal gene dna sequences  <cit> . with more than  <dig> species, viola is the largest genus of the violaceae and the only one widely distributed in the northern hemisphere  <cit> . based on chromosome counts  and isozyme expression data  <cit>  it can be estimated that roughly two thirds of viola species belong to paleopolyploid lineages having secondary base numbers ranging from x =  <dig> to x =  <dig> or higher. "true" diploids are known only from two sections, andinium  from south america  <cit>  and chamaemelanium  which is mainly northern amphi-pacific . tentative genus phylogenies have been based on rrna internal transcribed spacer  sequence data in several studies  but this marker has proven of no use for recovering any of these polyploid relationships . the genus phylogeny is currently being re-examined using low-copy nuclear genes .

in arabidopsis five of the  <dig> genes associated with pol iv/v have been duplicated, apparently independently, and have undergone subfunctionalization with respect to pol iv and v . for nrpd2/e <dig> in eudicots, available sequence information suggests numerous independent duplications and that these paralogs are often subject to concerted evolution and gene death  <cit> . in this study, we elucidate the origin of duplication of the nrpd2/e2-like genes within the violaceae and aspects of its evolution and phylogeny within viola. polyploidy, which is known to be a major evolutionary process in viola, could be thought to interact with a nascent gene family such as nrpd2/e <dig>  for instance, could redundancy resulting from polyploidy destabilize the incipient differentiation of the two paralogs, nrpd2/e2-a and nrpd2/e2-b, or could the occasional loss of primary duplication be compensated for by secondary duplications resulting from polyploidy? the immediate consequence of gene duplication is redundancy, which will generally lead to loss or pseudogenization of one paralog unless the paralogs become subfunctionalized or neofunctionalized. positive selection can be taken as evidence of neofunctionalization. it is therefore of relevance to detect to what degree positive selection has acted on duplicated nrpd2/e2-like paralogs within the violaceae, and if it has, at which sites and on which phylogenetic branches.

RESULTS
assignment and naming of nrpd2/e2-like homologs in violaceae
nrpd2/e2-a and nrpd2/e2-b are arbitrary labels that denote the two paralogs found in viola and allexis. they do not reflect orthology to duplicated nrpd2/e <dig> loci outside of violaceae, and do not imply that the respective binding specificities of the paralogs to pol iv and pol v are known. appended digits to the sequence name separate homoeologs of a paralog within a single specimen .

nrpd2/e2-like homologs in violaceae
genbank sequence data for the malpighiales demonstrate duplicate copies of nrpd2/e <dig> in both manihot esculenta  and populus trichocarpa  but not in euphorbia esula . in manihot both paralogs are potentially functional but in populus one paralog  is characterized by frameshift and non-synonymous mutations not reconcilable with nrpd2/e <dig> activity. the two copies found in manihot, populus and viola are not orthologous to each other . we obtained and analyzed sequence information from six non-viola violaceae taxa . these sequences were aligned to exon  sequences from genbank of euphorbia, manihot and populus. outside viola, we found singleton nrpd2/e <dig> in all of anchietea parvifolia, corynostylis arborea, cubelium concolor , hybanthus enneaspermus and rinorea ilicifolia. like viola, allexis batangae had duplicated nrpd2/e <dig> genes, but only the nrpd2/e2-b paralog was putatively functional; its nrpd2/e2-a paralog was a pseudogene that contained three frameshift mutations and stop codons in all three reading frames.

taxa used in this study, with respective genbank accessions for dna sequences and voucher information. for each taxon systematic affinity , chromosome counts , and putative ploidal levels , are indicated. genbank accession ids are sorted by paralog , and by homoeolog ; gene copies excluded from phylogenetic analysis, because they were considered too short for reliable analysis, are put in brackets. note that nrpd2/e2-a and nrpd2/e2-b are arbitrary labels, and that nrpd2/e2-a and nrpd2/e2-b in euphorbiaceae, salicaceae and violaceae are not orthologous to each other. herbarium acronyms for voucher specimen deposition  follow holmgren and holmgren  <cit> .

our inferences of the plastid and nuclear ribosomal phylogeny of violaceae  were congruent with previous analyses of the family, regarding both general topology  <cit>  and the placement of cubelium  <cit> . rinorea was placed as sister to the rest of the violaceae, with a cubelium + orthion clade and an allexis + viola clade as successive sisters to a hybanthus  clade. all branches received high  bootstrap support.

the nrpd2/e <dig> phylogenies  were incongruent with the species tree. again, rinorea was placed as sister to the rest of the violaceae with relatively high bootstrap support . within rest-violaceae three well-supported clades were found, one consisting of nrpd2/e2-a copy of allexis and viola , a second of the nrpd2/e2-b copy of allexis and viola , and a third  consisting of hybanthus and cubelium as sisters to a strongly supported  anchietea + corynostylis clade. whether it is hybanthus  or cubelium  that is sister to the rest within the last clade depends on the analysis, but neither topology receives strong bootstrap support . weak support is given for an nrpd2/e2-a + nrpd2/e2-b clade . however, the inter-relationships of these three main clades remain elusive and depend on whether cubelium and hybanthus are included in the analysis .

no evidence of recombination was detected in the violaceae alignment using gard . two possible recombination breakpoints were detected, but the topologies resulting from phylogenetic analyses of the partitions were congruent.

the reconciled tree , constructed in genetree by embedding the nrpd2/e <dig> tree  within the species tree , explains the incongruence between these two trees by hypothesizing two events of gene duplication and three losses. a first duplication was postulated on the basal branch of all violaceae except rinorea, meaning that one paralog would have been lost in viola and allexis but retained in cubelium, hybanthus, anchietea and corynostylis. the second paralog may have been retained only in viola and allexis, before duplicating a second time in their common ancestor and diversify into their present nrpd2/e2-a and nrpd2/e2-b paralogs.

nrpd2/e2-like homologs in viola
there were considerable differences in the relative number of copies of nrpd2/e2-a and nrpd2/e2-b across lineages of the genus viola , but seen as a whole nrpd2/e <dig> always occurred in two or more potentially functional copies. only the two diploid sections andinium and chamaemelanium appeared to have single and functional copies of each of nrpd2/e2-a and nrpd2/e2-b. all gene copies appeared functional in the neopolyploids of the latter section . non-functional gene copies were identified by the often numerous occurrence of premature stop codons and frameshift mutations within exons ; in a single case  the sequence was assumed to be non-functional because of a partial duplication within the highly conserved gemerd amino acid motif of exon  <dig>  taxa of section erpetion  and section chilenium  had equal numbers of nrpd2/e2-a and nrpd2/e2-b copies;  <dig> and  <dig> of each, respectively, but differed in their respective numbers of putatively functional copies. all members of the sections melanium and viola had unbalanced numbers of nrpd2/e2-a and nrpd2/e2-b. typically, taxa of section viola had two putatively functional copies of nrpd2/e2-a and one non-functional copy of nrpd2/e2-b . members of section melanium had four to six copies of nrpd2/e2-a, of which one or several could be non-functional, but no copies of nrpd2/e2-b. unbalanced numbers of nrpd2/e2-a and nrpd2/e2-b copies were found also in v. brevistipulata and v. nuttallii  but, in light of their ploidy levels and expected copy number, this likely reflects heterozygosity in one of the nrpd2/e2-a loci  or the nrpd2/e2-b locus .

the mp and ml phylogenies of nrpd2/e2-a and nrpd2/e2-b in viola are all largely congruent  with an  unpublished phylogeny for the genus based on another low-copy nuclear gene , with the exceptions that nrpd2/e2-b is absent in the melvio clade, in the entire section melanium and in v. hirta of section viola. generally higher bootstrap support was obtained for nrpd2/e2-b than for nrpd2/e2-a, reflecting that the former has ca  <dig> bp longer introns and therefore more phylogenetically informative sites. working our way up from the root of the two consensus trees in figure  <dig>  v. congesta  is sister to the rest of the genus, sandwiched by branches receiving strong bootstrap support in all analyses. next comes a polytomy of three lineages, here referred to as chilerp, melvio  and cham. the chilerp clade, which received only weak ml bootstrap support, but was recovered for both nrpd2/e2-a  and nrpd2/e2-b , consisted of various v. banksii  and v. maculata  lineages, of which one internal mixed species lineage received 100% bootstrap support. the melvio clade, missing for nrpd2/e2-b, received strong support for nrpd2/e2-a  and consisted of a basal polytomy of taxa of section viola within which a strongly supported  section melanium is nested. the large and strongly supported cham clade included sequences from all represented sections except andinium and, in the case of nrpd2/e2-b, melanium. a basal dichotomy in the cham clade lead to two strongly supported sub-clades: one sub-clade consisting of one v. maculata sister to two v. banksii sequences, and a second sub-clade in which taxa of sections chamaemelanium and viola formed a polytomy; in nrpd2/e2-a section melanium was a monophyletic group  within this basal polytomy. within the polytomies of cham and melvio the species constellation of , , and v. dirimliensis sister to the rest of section melanium were common.

selective forces
the pattern of change of dn/ds ratios along the sequence is shown in figure  <dig>  using the sliding window option for pairwise comparison of rinorea with three data sets:   <dig> nrpd2/e <dig> sequences from cubelium/corynostylis/hybanthus, in which the gene is not duplicated;   <dig> nrpd2/e2-a sequences from allexis and viola; and   <dig> nrpd2/e2-b sequences from viola. the dn/ds ratios are well below  <dig> throughout most of the sequence for cubelium/corynostylis/hybanthus, thus indicating purifying selection. it is for the most part also so for nrpd2/e2-a and nrpd2/e2-b, but for both paralogs a  <dig> bp  region with dn/ds considerably higher than  <dig> is identified near the 3' end of exon  <dig> , indicating positive selection in both these paralogs. within the region of positive selection a compensatory pattern conserving regionally the net charge of mutations was found : substitution of e/d  in position  <dig> is compensated for by gain of e in position  <dig> in nrpd2/e2-b. thus, the positions of charged amino acids are subject to selection.

the  <dig> bp region where positive selection was detected  was further analyzed using the codeml software of the paml package for estimating dn/ds ratios of  <dig> specified branches in the predefined phylogenetic tree. a 60-parameter model, assuming one dn/ds ratio for each branch, was found to marginally better fit the data  than a single-parameter model, assuming a uniform dn/ds ratio across all branches in the tree. although many branches in the tree had positive dn/ds ratios, especially those immediately after the duplication basal to allexis and viola, only for the branch basal to b_congesta was the dn/ds ratio significantly larger than  <dig> . a model assuming a common dn/ds ratio for the three basal-most branches following the duplication, i.e. basal to a_allexis, a_congesta and b_congesta, received strong support . thus, both nrpd2/e <dig> paralogs seem to have been subjected to positive selection  soon after the duplication, but apparently not at exactly the same time . for nrpd2/e2-a, positive selection is hypothesized  immediately after the duplication of nrpd2/e <dig> and before the split of allexis and viola, and  within the rest of viola after viola section andinium split off, and finally  also within the cham clade. for nrpd2/e2-b positive selection occurred somewhat later, and only in the branch leading to viola .

discussion
nrpd2/e <dig> phylogeny within violaceae
the nrpd2/e2-a and nrpd2/e2-b phylogenies differ in several respects from the already published organism phylogenies for viola  <cit> , based solely on the nuclear its region, and for violaceae  <cit> , based on  <dig> nuclear and chloroplast regions. our results indicate that, at the family level, this incongruence is due to duplication of nrpd2/e <dig> and the uneven sorting of paralogs among lineages . within viola, the incongruence appears to result partly from the notorious failure of its to capture allopolyploid relationships, a common consequence of gene conversion among the often thousands of copies of this gene within the plant genome  <cit> , and partly from the evolutionary unstable copy number of nrpd2/e <dig> . a genus phylogeny based on low-copy nuclear genes is currently being constructed and is largely congruent with the nrpd2/e2-a phylogeny .

in comparison with an organism phylogeny of violaceae, based on data from tokuoka  <cit>  with an extra accession of cubelium rbcl, our data suggest that nrpd2/e <dig> was duplicated twice within the evolutionary history of the family. the reconciled genetree phylogeny  indicated a first duplication relatively basally in the family, after the split of rinorea, with subsequent complete sorting of paralogs in the descendant genera. so that one paralog was retained in cubelium, hybanthus, anchietea and corynostylis, and the second paralog was retained in allexis and viola. this interpretation, however, entirely rests on the conflicting phylogenetic position of cubelium in the species phylogeny, which received strong bootstrap support , versus in the nrpd2/e <dig> phylogeny which was less strongly supported . on the other hand, we found no evidence that this incongruence resulted of recombination.

the second duplication event, in the common ancestor of the genera allexis and viola, is incontestable because it is retained in most of the descendants. lineage sorting of paralogs may, however, also explain the phylogenetic pattern and link the two duplication events. the first duplication may in fact have persisted in the lineage leading to allexis and viola, but been subject to an event of sequence replacement in the common ancestor of these two genera. either scenario would appear in the phylogeny as an independent duplication basal to allexis and viola.

interestingly, for the caryophyllaceae it has not been possible to trace back the origin of the nrpd2/e <dig> duplication event either. judging by paralog similarity, the duplication in tribe sileneae seems to be a relatively recent one and may well have occurred within this tribe  <cit> . in contrast, cerastium, which belongs to another subfamily  <cit> , has nrpd2/e2-a and nrpd2/e2-b paralogs that are substantially more divergent than in the sileneae and that may result from an older duplication . thus, it may be that the small nrpd2/e <dig> gene family is subject to massive concerted evolution between paralogs, as already indicated in silene by gene conversion  within one lineage. due to these factors it may be hard to pinpoint the duplication event on a phylogenetic tree.

within the violaceae, there are certain indications from ongoing research that the original duplication of nrpd2/e <dig> may be connected with whole genome duplications via allopolyploidy. recent findings for the genus ionidium, which belongs to the same clade as anchietea and corynostylis in the present study, based on karyology  and a low-copy nuclear gene , suggest that the currently accepted base chromosome number  for this genus, and for large parts of the family, is in fact tetraploid. there is some evidence of paleaotetraploidy also in viola as, apart from nrpd2/e <dig>  also several other low-copy genes have been found to be duplicated, i.e. chalcone synthase  <cit> , shikimate dehydrogenase  and homeotic floral genes .

most viola groups were found to have a more or less balanced number of nrpd2/e2-a and nrpd2/e2-b copies. presumably due to redundancy following polyploidy, massive pseudogenization of this gene family has happened in the paleopolyploid sections chilenium and erpetion. however, the situation is very different in the other two polyploid sections, viola and melanium. these two sections have their allopolyploid origin in one or several wide hybridization events between two major diploid clades, cham and melvio. the cham clade, today represented by the diploid section chamaemelanium, has apparently functional copies of both nrpd2/e2-a and nrpd2/e2-b, while the melvio clade, which is now extinct as diploid, has secondarily lost its nrpd2/e2-b paralog. assuming subneofunctionalization of the two paralogs , this would mean that the remaining melvio paralog, which is by phylogenetic origin an "a" paralog, must have regained the ancestral expression state performing both "a" and "b" functions. thus, the sections viola and melanium inherited one paralog of each nrpd2/e2-a and nrpd2/e2-b from the cham ancestor, and from the melvio an nrpd2/e2-a paralog with both "a" and "b" function. this "incomplete redundancy" in the polyploids may have lead to further gene death within the two sections. in species belonging to these sections , the current cham nrpd2/e2-b paralog is either a pseudogene  or has been completely lost , while having two nrpd2/e2-a copies, one derived from cham and a second from melvio. in v. spathulata all the melvio paralogs have been pseudogenized and only the cham-derived paralogs are expressed; this was, apparently, also followed by a more recent polyploidization event.

thus, both sections viola and melanium, although tetraploid, possess putatively functional nrpd2/e <dig> copies only of nrpd2/e2-a, derived from the ancestral melvio and cham genomes. as both these seem functional, and have not suffered the same fate as the nrpd2/e2-b paralog during the same period of time, it may be that some degree of de novo subfunctionalization has evolved between these two nrpd2/e2-a paralogs. further research is needed to shed light upon this issue.

positive selection is seen in regions associated with subunit interaction
in cases with ongoing neofunctionalization following gene duplication, one would expect positive selection to be acting on parts of one or both paralogs, and dn to be larger than ds . our findings for nrpd2/e <dig> fit well with these assumptions: only purifying selection was detected among taxa with singleton nrpd2/e2; while soon after duplication of the gene in the common ancestor of allexis and viola both nrpd2/e <dig> paralogs seem to have been subjected to rapid sub- and neofunctionalization. this is detected as dn/ds ratios larger than  <dig> along these branches, indicating positive selection, especially early in the divergence process . this process appears to have happened at different times in nrpd2/e2-a and in nrpd2/e2-b. our branch analysis suggests rapid specialization of nrpd2/e2-a in the common ancestor of allexis and viola while for nrpd2/e2-b, positive selection occurred at a later time and only in viola, not in allexis. compared to viola, higher redundancy in allexis due to a still incomplete complementation of the two paralogs, may have facilitated pseudogenization of nrpd2/e2-a in a. batangae.

it is likely that the  <dig> bp region is important for the specialization and neofunctionalization of the two nrpd2/e <dig> paralogs in viola. crystallography of yeast pol ii has shown that this region of the second-largest subunit  is part of a "hybrid binding" domain that is involved in subunit recognition and binding  <cit> . the first half of this region corresponds to an ordered loop interacting with the tenth-largest subunit  and its second half forms an α-helix that interacts with the third-largest subunit . since structure and function tend to be conserved over all eukaryot pols  <cit>  and, especially, because of the close phylogenetic relationship between the pol ii and pol iv/v subunit genes  <cit> , we can assume that this region of nrpd2/nrpe <dig> interacts with homologs of nrpd <dig> and nrpd <dig>  under the assumption that the differentiation of nrpd2/e2-a and nrpd2/e2-b reflect specialization with respect to pol iv and v, we suggest that this region is important for correct recognition of subunits specific to pol iv and pol v in viola. this likely applies also to duplicated nrpd2/e <dig> in other eudicot lineages, and in this respect the between-paralog divergence of the very same region also in silene  <cit>  is noteworthy.

in arabidopsis thaliana the exact subunit compositions of pol iv and pol v are known  <cit> . in this species, only a single copy of nrpd2/e <dig> is expressed  and its protein product assembles with both pol iv and pol v  <cit> . of the two subunit genes with whose gene products nrpd2-a and nrpd2-b interact, the nrpd <dig> homolog is not duplicated in arabidopsis and shared between pols ii, iv and iv. nrpd3/e <dig>  however, exists in two rather similar paralogs  that are incompletely subfunctionalized between pol ii/v and pol v and apparently have been under positive selection . in the other genome sequenced eudicots, populus trichocarpa and vitis vinifera, neither of these genes are duplicated. if, however, nrpd3/e <dig> is duplicated in viola and violaceae, in addition to the basal differentiation of nrpd <dig> and nrpe <dig>  this could give some indications about how nrpd2/e <dig> came to be duplicated in this angiosperm family.

CONCLUSIONS
aspects of the build, function and origin of the two atypical plant rna polymerases pol iv and pol v are a hot topic in current research. this knowledge has in turn opened for study the dynamics of the origin and specialization of the individual subunits and their co-evolution within a phylogenetic framework.

herein, we have presented the first documentation of possible co-evolution among subunits of pol iv/v, from within the angiosperm family violaceae. following duplication, nrpd2/e2-a and nrpd2/e2-b, encoding pol iv/v subunits, underwent rapid specialization  in a region that is important for subunit interaction and recognition. we conclude that correct recognition of the type-specific subunits is important for the correct function of each of pol iv and pol v.

our study on violaceae and previous studies on caryophyllaceae draw a picture of nrpd2/e <dig> as a young gene family, still in the process of diverging and specializing and still subject to strong concerted evolution among paralogs. the few species and genera that have been studied show a variable number of pol iv/v gene copies. since the divergence of pol iv and pol v seems to have only barely preceded the radiation of the angiosperms, we can expect their young gene families to have acquired different lineage-specific specializations within angiosperms.
