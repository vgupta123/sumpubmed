BACKGROUND
gram-negative bacteria of the species xanthomonas campestris are able to cause disease on brassicaceae and are responsible for important yield and quality losses in brassica crops such as cabbage, radish, cauliflower or chinese cabbage  <cit> . interestingly, xanthomonas campestris isolates are natural pathogens of the model plant species arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . based on host range, mode of infection and the disease symptoms caused on plants, the species was further divided in three pathovars  <cit> . the pathovar campestris regroups strains which are able to cause black rot on at least one cruciferous species. strains of the pathovar incanae cause bacterial blight on garden stock and wallflower while those of pathovar raphani are the causal agent of bacterial leaf spot on both cruciferous and solanaceous plants  <cit> . finally, weakly or non-pathogenic  strains, which were originally assigned to the pathovars barbareae or armoraciae, were included into a fourth group of less-defined strains due to their relatedness by multilocus sequence analysis   <cit> . while strains of pathovars campestris and incanae use the hydathodes  to initiate a vascular infection of the plant, strains of the pathovar raphani seem to preferentially use stomata  to enter the leaf and colonize the mesophyll.

extensive molecular genetics of xanthomonas campestris has identified key pathogenicity determinants  such as extracellular polysaccharides, lipo-polysaccharides, dsf-dependent quorum sensing, extracellular enzymes  exported by the type ii secretion systems or proteins secreted by the type iii secretion  system. type iii-secreted proteins  include type iii effector  proteins which are injected inside the plant cells where many of them interfere with cell physiology and plant immunity. because the hrp  t3s system is essential for xanthomonas virulence, it is assumed that the type iii effectome is also globally essential for any interaction with the plant. yet, individual effectors usually have limited or non-significant contribution to pathogenicity when studied alone, probably reflecting functional redundancy and/or additivity between effectors. hrp genes are not expressed in xanthomonas cultivated in rich media. yet, hrp gene expression can be induced in xanthomonas in specific minimal media  that were thought to mimic in planta conditions . two master regulators of the hrp systems which are both required for virulence and hrp gene expression in minimal medium have been identified: hrpx is an arac-type transcriptional activator inducing the expression of all hrp operons but hrpa upon binding to the plant-inducible promoter  box  in the promoter region  <cit> . expression of most t3e genes is under the control of hrpx . hrpg, an ompr-type transcriptional regulator and its putative cognate sensor kinase hpas control the expression of hrpx, the hrpa operon and other genes  <cit> . interestingly, several point mutations in hrpg  can render its activity constitutive in the absence of inducing condition and result in an increased aggressiveness on plants  <cit> .

to date, four complete genome sequences are available in the x. campestris species  and six draft genomes  . these strains have in common a ca. 5-mb circular chromosome with approx.  <dig> % g + c content. the presence of plasmids has only been reported in strains b- <dig>  cn <dig>  cn <dig> and cn <dig>  <cit> . no genomic information is available yet on the pathovar incanae and the non-pathogenic group of x. campestris. comparative genomics has proven to be an important tool to mine for pathogenicity determinants, host specificity factors and in particular for t3e  <cit> . due to the lack of conserved secretion/translocation signals in t3sp, those can only be predicted by indirect means: in silico proteomes can be studied by homology searches with known t3e sequences, by searching for eukaryotic signatures  and/or predicted genes can be scrutinized for the presence of a pip box. indeed, co-expression of t3sp with the hrp t3s system is the rule and has proven to be a powerful tool for the identification of novel t3e in xanthomonas  <cit> , ralstonia solanacearum  <cit>  and pseudomonas syringae  <cit> . to this end, the analysis of xanthomonas transcriptomes in hrp-inducing conditions or in deregulated mutants expressing constitutively the hrp regulon has been a major source for the discovery of novel effectors .

here, we report on the genome sequencing of four x. campestris strains of the pathovars incanae, raphani and np and their comparison with publically available x. campestris genomes. this approach identified a very limited core type iii effectome for this species of xanthomonas. a transcriptomic analysis of the hrpg regulon has also been performed in a x. campestris pv. raphani strain cfbp 5828r and provides important information for the structural annotation of the genes and precious hints for the identification of candidate type iii effector proteins as well as genes which could contribute to pathogenicity of x. campestris.

RESULTS
genome sequencing and properties
four x. campestris strains belonging to pathovars not or poorly characterized at the genomic levels were selected for this study . two strains of the pathovar incanae, cfbp  <dig> and cfbp  <dig>  were chosen because these strains were isolated on two distinct continents at  <dig> years interval. notably, strain cfbp  <dig>  which was isolated from hoary stock  in the usa in  <dig>  is the pathotype strain of pathovar incanae. strain cfbp  <dig> belongs to the raphani pathovar and was isolated from radish in the usa. so far, only one complete genome has been determined in this pathovar  <cit> . the sequenced strain 756c was isolated from cabbage in east asia and was classified in the raphani pathovar based on its mlsa profile and pathogenicity  <cit> . strain cfbp  <dig> was initially classified as pathovar barbareae and designated as the pathotype strain of this pathovar but has recently been assigned to the x. campestris np  clade  <cit> .table  <dig> origin of xanthomonas campestris strains and genome properties

shotgun sequencing of genomic dna of rifampicin-resistant derivatives of these strains  was performed on hiseq <dig> illumina platform. a combination of paired-end  and mate-pair libraries  was used reaching 696- to 1142-fold theoretical coverage . genome assembly was performed using a combination of soapdenovo  <cit>  and velvet  <cit>  assemblers and yielded  <dig> to  <dig> contigs per genome. these contigs were further ordered into a large pseudochromosome based on the chromosomal organization of x. campestris pv. campestris strain  <dig>  resulting pseudochromosome sizes have both genome sizes  and g + c contents  which are typical for xanthomonas. for both strains cfbp 5825r and cfbp 5828r, one small  contig showing no homology to xanthomonas chromosomal sequences could not be assembled into the final pseudochromosome. consistently, we did not detect any endogenous plasmids in those strains  nor plasmid-like sequences in their genomes. due to their highly repetitive nature, transcription activator-like  effector sequences present in strains cfbp 5825r and cfbp 1606r could not be assembled and are not represented in the final assemblies. southern blot analyses of bamhi digested genomic dna indicate that at least one tal gene is present in each genome . with less than ten scaffolds per genome , these draft genomes are sufficiently well assembled to allow gene discovery and gene functional analyses and to develop molecular typing tools.

in order to determine the phylogenetic relationship of the newly sequenced strains in relation to nine published x. campestris genomes , all genomes were first structurally re-annotated using eugene-p. the resulting proteomes were compared using orthomcl and yielded a x. campestris core genome composed of more than  <dig> cds which was used to perform phylogenetic analyses. as inferred from amplified fragment length polymorphism  analyses  <cit> , x. campestris pv. campestris, is organized into at least three clades: clade xcca contains strains b <dig> and jx, clade xccc contains strains  <dig>  xca <dig> and atcc <dig> and clade g contains strains cn <dig>  cn <dig> and cn <dig> . in contrast to strains of pathovar campestris, strains of pathovars incanae and raphani did not cluster in monophyletic groups: this phylogenetic analysis could not fully discriminate between x. campestris np and x. campestris pv. incanae . the phylogenetic relationships at the subspecies level can also be determined using crispr systems  <cit> . cripr loci are bacterial immune systems which store fossil records of exogenous dna acquired during evolution upon phage infection or plasmid acquisition in the so-called spacer regions. interestingly, x. raphani strains cfbp 5828r and 756c were the only strains carrying a crispr locus. these two loci harbored identical repeats and  <dig> and  <dig> spacers in strains cfbp 5828r and 756c, respectively. the lack of common spacers between these two crispr loci and the significant distance separating the core genomes of these two strains  support the hypothesis that both strains diverged a long time ago.fig.  <dig> comparison of  <dig> publically available and newly sequenced xanthomonas campestris proteomes. orthologous proteins were determined using orthomcl software using homogenously re-annotated genomes. a a phylogenetic tree of x. campestris core proteomes  was generated using the phyml software . bootstrap values are indicated in grey for each branch. b size of x. campestris core orfeome was determined considering only cds with a single ortholog per genome. c numbers above black bars indicate the size of the pan orfeome. only one cds per orthology group was considered. the number of annotated cds per genome is indicated . the number of isolate-specific cds is given . d venn diagram illustrating the number of coding sequences shared among the core orfeomes ) in the four x. campestris pathovars. numbers in brackets indicate the number of genes in the core genome of the pathovars. xcc : x. campestris pv. campestris, xci : x. campestris pv. incanae, xcr : x. campestris pv. raphani, xcnp : x. campestris non-pathogenic



the x. campestris core orfeome was composed of  <dig> protein coding genes as estimated using orthomcl . in particular, the x. campestris pv. campestris core orfeome was composed of  <dig> cds. while each genome contains ca.  <dig> cds, the pan genomes of x. campestris and x. campestris pv. campestris encompass  <dig> and  <dig> cds, respectively . for x. campestris pv. campestris, the number of strain-specific cds in the pan orfeome was low indicating that these strains are genetically closely related. in contrast, each strains of the other x. campestris pathovars contributed more than  <dig> cds to the x. campestris pan orfeome probably as a result of the lower number of representative genomes per pathovar available for analysis. these results are in agreement with the phylogenetic relationships observed in the x. campestris core genome  indicating that the acquisition/fixation of these accessory genes is likely the result of speciation events that were essentially vertically inherited. the core orfeomes of these four x. campestris pathovars were compared . these analyses highlighted that the core orfeomes of pathovars raphani and incanae are slightly bigger in size than that of pathovar campestris which might reflect the lower number of genomes analysed for pathovars raphani and incanae. the x. campestris np clade was represented by a single strain cfbp 5825r which artificially increased the size of its core orfeome to  <dig> cds. the identification of these core and pan orfeome for the species and the different pathovars is an important resource to classify new strains and to mine for determinants of pathogenicity and host specificity.

avoidance of fls2- and efr-mediated pattern-triggered immunity  is restricted to pathovar campestris
perception of pathogen-associated molecular patterns  elicits pattern-triggered immunity which strongly restricts microbial pathogenicity. in this study, we investigated the diversity of two major bacterial pamp proteins: the flg <dig> peptide from the flic flagellin protein which is perceived by the fls <dig>  plant immune receptor of arabidopsis and the elf <dig> peptide from the elongation factor tu  which is monitored by the brassicaceae-specific ef-tu receptor . the lack of recognition of the flic flagellin of x. campestris pv. campestris by fls <dig> was previously reported  <cit>  and holds true for the eight strains studied here . in contrast, analysis of flic diversity in other pathovars showed that each other flic isoforms were predicted to be recognized by fls <dig>  the perception of x. campestris elongation factor tu  by efr is probably not systematic either. though essential residues k <dig>  f <dig> and r <dig> of the elicitor peptide elf <dig> are conserved at the species level, five strains of the pathovar campestris  express an ef-tu with a k2r substitution . this polymorphism likely prevents recognition by efr since elf18-k2r peptides failed to elicit efr-dependent responses  <cit> . these results suggest that avoidance of fls2- mediated pti have been acquired first during the evolution of the pathovar campestris for flic and later for ef-tu.fig.  <dig> conservation in xanthomonas campestris of flg <dig>  and elf <dig>  peptides from flic and ef-tu pamp proteins, respectively. peptides with/without predicted elicitor activity are in black/grey, respectively. residues which are essential for elicitor activity and polymorphic in x. campestris are underlined in black



a reduced core type iii secretome in x. campestris
in order to determine the type iii secretome of the thirteen x. campestris strains, genomes were analyzed manually using tblastn against t3sp reported for the xanthomonas genus  . presence of genes encoding homologues of t3sp was validated if sequence identity was higher than 60% over the full-length protein. at least  <dig> t3sp were present for cfbp 5828r,  <dig> for cfbp 5825r,  <dig> for cfbp 1606r, and  <dig>  for cfbp 2527r. these predicted secretomes are rather small, especially considering that they include hrpw, xopa and hpaa which are likely involved in the secretion/translocation process per se. in contrast, the secretome of x. campestris pv. campestris comprised  <dig> t3sp on average   <cit> . avrxcca <dig> was not considered in these effectomes because there is no experimental evidence to support its secretion by the t3s system nor its co-regulation with the t3s system.table  <dig> candidate type iii-secreted proteins identified in x. campestris strains sequenced in this study

the core type iii secretomes were determined for each pathovar and compared with each other. sizes of the core secretomes ranged from  <dig> for pathovar raphani to  <dig> for pathovar campestris . only six t3sp were conserved among all the  <dig> x. campestris strains. hrpw, xopa and hpaa put aside, only xopf <dig>  xopp and xopal <dig> t3e genes were detected in all genomes . the type iii secretome of pathovar raphani contained three t3sp  absent from the core secretomes of the other pathovars and was very different from the t3sp repertoire found in the other three pathovars. strain belonging to pathovars campestris, incanae and np shared  <dig> t3sp out of 17/ <dig> present in their core secretomes. these results suggest that breeding of disease resistance should focus on the in planta recognition of the core t3e xopf <dig>  xopp and xopal <dig> in order to achieve broad-spectrum resistance in brassicaceae against most x. campestris strains.fig.  <dig> diversity of type iii secretome in xanthomonas campestris. a presence /absence  matrix of genes encoding putative t3sp including t3e  and other accessory proteins  was searched in genomic sequences by tblastn using known t3sp protein sequences . x. campestris core t3e are indicated in red. grey and blue boxes correspond to protein identities ranging from 40- <dig> % and 60- <dig> % over the entire length of the reference protein. numbers indicate copy numbers of hax genes. the minimal size of the secretome is indicated below the table. b venn diagram illustrating the overlap between the core secretomes of x. campestris pathovars: campestris , non-pathogenic , incanae  and raphani . numbers in brackets indicate the number of the core and accessory type iii secreted proteins as inferred from published genome sequences in those pathovars. genes orthologous to known type iii secreted proteins  were identified by blast. asterisk indicates that all predicted type iii secreted proteins of strain cfbp 5825r were used in this analysis. xcc: x. campestris pv. campestris, xci: x. campestris pv. incanae, xcr: x. campestris pv. raphani, xcnp: x. campestris non-pathogenic



analysis of the transcriptome of strain cfbp 5828r by rna sequencing improves genome annotation
in order to identify genes co-regulated with the t3s system, strain cfbp 5828r of x. campestris pathovar raphani was transformed either with an empty vector  or the same vector expressing a constitutively active form of the hrp master regulator hrpg . total rna was purified from cells growing exponentially in moka rich medium and derived from three independent biological experiments. after removal of rrna by oligonucleotide-capture, these six samples were size-fractionated to discard the smallest rna fraction  and were subjected to strand-specific rna sequencing on an illumina hiseq <dig> platform. sequencing yielded from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> reads of  <dig> bp per sample containing 3– <dig> % of reads corresponding to rrnas plus tmrnas .

the cfbp 5828r genome sequence was first re-annotated taking advantage of this large dataset using eugene-p software  <cit> . expression of all but  <dig> protein-coding genes  could be detected by rna sequencing. out of the  <dig> ncrnas obtained by in silico ncrna prediction,  <dig>  were not supported by rna sequencing suggesting that these may either be artifacts or only expressed in specific conditions. this new annotation based on rna sequencing includes  <dig> new coding sequences . based on these expression data,  <dig> transcriptional starts could be determined leading to the reannotation of  <dig> translational start sites. one hundred forty-five new ncrna could also be annotated. several ncrna have recently been shown to be important for xanthomonas pathogenicity  <cit> . among the  <dig> ncrna identified in x. euvesicatoria strain 85– <dig>  twelve ncrna  are detected in all x. campestris genomes analyzed in this study suggesting a biological significance  <cit> . expression of all those ncrna could be detected in x. campestris pv. raphani strain cfbp 5828r though only three reads were identified for sx <dig> .

in conclusion, the structural annotation of protein-coding genes and ncrna was significantly improved by the use of rna sequencing.

transcriptomic analysis of cfbp 5828r by rna sequencing identifies the hrpg regulon
in order to identify hrpg-regulated genes, rna sequencing reads from the individual libraries  were mapped to the re-annotated genome sequence of strain cfbp 5828r. read counts per objects were used to calculate differential gene expression with r  and deseq package   <cit> . this approach identified  <dig> and seven genes the expression of which was induced and repressed more than five fold , respectively, in the strain ectopically expressing hrpg* when compared to the strain containing the empty vector . notably, biological reproducibility was extremely good though slightly more biological variability was observed among the empty vector controls . to validate these data, rt-qpcr experiments were performed for  <dig> genes including constitutively expressed, induced and repressed genes . a positive correlation was observed between rna sequencing and rt-qpcr results thus validating the rna sequencing approach with an independent method. not so surprisingly, the dynamic range of rt-qpcr was narrower than that of rna deep-sequencing.fig.  <dig> identification of the hrpg regulon of strain cfbp 5828r of x. campestris pv. raphani by rna sequencing. a dot plot of the normalized expression levels of all genes in presence of hrpg* versus the empty vector . the diagonal indicates genes which expression level is identical in both conditions. red lines indicate boundaries where gene expression is induced five-fold relative to the other condition. red dots indicate genes which expression is significantly induced at least five fold relative to the other condition. the hrpg gene is indicated in green. b dot plot of the expression ratios  of  <dig> genes determined either by rna sequencing  or quantitative rt-pcr . the diagonal indicates genes which expression ratios are identical with both techniques. bars indicate standard deviations. c box plot of the normalized expression ratios of hrpg-induced genes encoding the t3s system  and type iii secreted proteins  versus the other genes . box plot of the normalized expression ratios of hrpg-induced genes with a pip box  in their promoter region versus the other genes . red dots indicate the mean values. significant mean difference was detected using a welch-test

the vast majority of genes with a hrpg-dependent expression are positively regulated by hrpg . as expected, genes encoding the hrp t3s system are included in this list as well as all genes coding for predicted t3sp . interestingly, genes of the t3s system and its t3sp are the most highly induced suggesting that t3sp candidates should be expected among genes with the highest induction ratios . in xanthomonas, hrpg-dependent expression depends in a large part on the hrpx regulator which activates promoters containing the pip box. pip boxes are found in front of most operons encoding the t3s system and t3sp . in contrast, only  <dig> % of the  <dig> other genes also have a pip motif in their promoter region. hrpg-dependent induction of gene expression without a pip box is globally less intense  suggesting that hrpx, as in other xanthomonas, is also a major regulator of the hrpg regulon in x. campestris pv. raphani strain cfbp 5828r. besides “protein secretion” mediated by the t3s system, the remaining hrpg-induced genes are significantly enriched in the following go terms : cytochrome complex assembly ; branched-chain amino acid biosynthetic process ; respiratory chain complex iv assembly ; heme transport  and proteolysis and peptidase activity . because extracellular protease activity was shown to be important for pathogenicity in x. campestris pv. campestris strain  <dig>  <cit>  and to be dependent on hrpg in x. euvesicatoria strain 85– <dig>  <cit> , we measured the global extracellular protease activity of strain cfbp 5828r, strains carrying hrpg* or the empty vector . to this end, strains were spotted and grown on moka medium containing milk proteins. surprisingly, the strain carrying hrpg* showed a reduced degradation of milk proteins compared to strains without hrpg*. hrpg does repress the expression of the arg-c endoprotease gene xcrcfbp 5828_m <dig> . yet, its basal expression levels are low compared to the eight protease genes the expression of which is induced in the hrpg* strain . these results suggest that extracellular protease activity is regulated post transcriptionally by hrpg.

in contrast to x. euvesicatoria strain 85– <dig>  the expression of ncrna sx <dig>  sx <dig> and sx <dig> was not hrpg-dependent in x. campestris pv. raphani strain 5828r  <cit> . yet, the expression of eight novel ncrna was positively regulated by hrpg  . four ncrna are encoded within the hrp gene cluster. among the eight hrpg-regulated ncrna, three are antisense rna to the t3e genes xopr, xopl and xopp and one is antisense to the regulatory gene hrpg. the biological functions of those ncrnas remain to be determined experimentally in x. campestris.

as for the seven repressed genes of the hrpg regulon, these encode an endoproteinase , the pel <dig> pectate lyase , a small gene cluster comprising two putative transporters  and one transcriptional regulator of the marr family  and two clustered hypothetical proteins . with such a limited number of genes, no significant enrichment in gene ontology  terms could be identified among the hrpg-repressed genes.

discussion
genomic diversity in the x. campestris species
the  <dig> x. campestris genome sequences now available provide a panorama of the four major genomic groups composing this species. with a complete t3s system and  <dig> predicted t3e, it may not be appropriate to consider strain cfbp  <dig> to be non-pathogenic as proposed  <cit> . the np designation only indicates that none of the brassicaceae tested at the time were appropriate hosts for these strains under the inoculation conditions tested. future studies should determine if strain cfbp  <dig> possesses for instance a functional t3s system and if it is virulent on at least one brassicaceae plant.

a great genomic diversity can be observed both at the intra- and inter-pathovar levels. previous studies already demonstrated that the pathovar campestris is composed of at least three clades  <cit> . this study suggests that comparable diversity is expected for pathovars raphani and incanae. the lack of common crispr spacers between the two strains of the pathovar raphani is particularly striking. yet, a polyphyletic origin of this pathovar is unlikely since the crispr repeats are identical between the two strains. thus, it suggests that the two strains diverged a long time ago to allow the loss of all ancestral spacers in at least one strain and the likely acquisition of a significant number of new spacers since this event. importantly, no crispr loci could be identified in the other strains so that genomic diversity within this species cannot be precisely determined using this tool and should thus rely on mlsa  <cit> , aflp  <cit>  or mlva  schemes as developed for other xanthomonas species .

it is tempting to compare our results to p. syringae where a similar analysis was conducted  <cit> : the p. syringae core genome is composed of  <dig> genes  which is close to the  <dig> genes for x. campestris. in both instances, comparable numbers of strains were analyzed:  <dig> p. syringae genomes vs.  <dig> for x. campestris. while estimation of core genomes is rather insensitive to annotation quality or homogeneity, the pan genome size can be drastically affected. this could be one of the explanations for the rather small pan genome of the  <dig> x. campestris strains  compared to the  <dig>  genes for the  <dig> p. syringae strains. thus, x. campestris appears as a rather homogeneous genomic group compared to p. syringae which is considered as composed of several genospecies  <cit> . these observations are in agreement with the fact that p. syringae species has a larger host range compared to x. campestris that only infect plant of the brassicaceae family.

x. campestris core type iii effectome is reduced to three genes
considering the high quality of the genomes obtained in the frame of this analysis, one can be rather confident in the predicted sizes of x. campestris type iii secretomes. pan type iii secretomes range from  <dig> to  <dig> for pathovars raphani and campestris respectively . despite having a large core genome, the predicted core effectome of the  <dig> x. campestris strains was found to consist of only three bona fide effectors  plus three t3sp  which are likely to be involved in the type iii secretion and translocation process itself. the core effectomes of  <dig> x. axonopodis strains and  <dig> x. axonopodis pv. manihotis strains are made of ca. eight and six candidate t3es, respectively  <cit> . yet, these two effectomes only have xopn in common. combined with our results, only xopf <dig> may still be considered as a core xanthomonas effector though pseudogenized in many x. axonopodis strains  <cit> . this situation is also reminiscent of type iii effectome studies performed in p. syringae and r. solanacearum. in the species complex r. solanacearum,  <dig> out of the  <dig> t3e composing the pan effectome are conserved in all eleven strains analyzed  <cit> . the p. syringae core effectome is limited to five t3e  though none is strictly conserved and intact in all  <dig> strains  <cit> . therefore, there is no overlap between p. syringae and x. campestris core effectomes. these results challenge the concept of core effectomes as soon as increased biodiversity is analyzed at the species level or above. it also indicates that no universal set of effectors is used to infect plants, which could suggest that pathogenic bacteria use host-specific strategies to circumvent plant immunity or promote susceptibility. yet, the functional redundancy observed within effectomes rather suggests that bacteria may use a repertoire of unrelated effectors to target conserved plant targets. this later hypothesis is supported by the identification of important plant susceptibility hubs such as rin <dig>  sweets or rlck vii . to date, the molecular functions of xopf <dig>  xopp t3e remain unknown. as for xopp, it was recently shown to block peptidoglycan- and chitin-triggered immunity in rice by inhibiting the u-box ubiquitin ligase ospub <dig>  a positive regulator of basal immunity  <cit> .

rna sequencing approaches in plant pathogens including xanthomonas are still in their early days and were so far used to identify regulons, transcriptional start sites or ncrnas . in this study, the sequencing of the transcriptome of x. campestris pv. raphani strain cfbp 5828r produced ca.  <dig> million reads of 51-bp resulting in  <dig>  gb of raw data. the use of a custom xanthomonas-optimized oligonucleotides set allowed a high ribodepletion efficacy  so that more than 93% of the total reads were specifically mapped to mrnas. 1000-fold coverage of the genome was achieved which is comparable to studies in x. campestris pv. campestris  <cit>  but significantly higher than studies in x. euvesicatoria, x. citri pv. citri and x. campestris pv. campestris   <cit> . the size of this dataset is also far above the accepted limit  for correct expression profiling, gene discovery or gene reannotation  <cit> . the rna reads were first used to improve the structural annotation of the genome using the eugene-p pipeline. one important difference of our rna sequencing approach with most of the above-mentioned reports is the use of strand-specific libraries. such libraries enable to assign individual reads to a specific dna strand in the genome and therefore allow, for instance, to identify overlapping or antisense rna molecules:  <dig> ncrna overlap with cds such as the three t3e genes xopr, xopl and xopp in x. campestris pv. raphani strain cfbp 5828r. early functional studies in x. euvesicatoria have shown that several ncrna contribute to pathogenicity  <cit> . only few new mrna were identified. yet, the major improvement is a better characterization of transcriptional start sites . this latter point is particularly relevant for t3e genes which are often characterized by an atypical codon usage and a lack of homology with known genes, thus preventing proper annotation of their tss . as an illustration, three t3e proteins are likely to be longer than automatically annotated. based on their 5’-utr, xopad, xopal <dig> and xopat may encode n-terminal extensions of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, respectively. compared to the published annotation of x. campestris pv. raphani strain 756c  <cit> , xopat and xopad may be  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids shorter in strain cfbp 5828r. for xopal <dig>  our data support the annotation of x. campestris pv. campestris strain b <dig> which is  <dig> amino acids longer than in strain  <dig> 

the hrpg regulon in x. campestris pv. raphani strain cfbp 5828r encompasses all predicted t3e, t3sp and t3s system genes
the small effectome of x. campestris pv. raphani suggests that more effectors could be discovered. to date, the most productive strategy remains to determine genes that are co-regulated with the genes encoding the hrp type iii secretion apparatus  <cit> . in our study, we chose to determine the hrpg regulon by rna sequencing using a constitutive active form of this regulator hrpg*. rna sequencing has a higher dynamic range than micro-arrays and also offers full genome coverage. the use of the hrpg* mutant allele was previously used successfully  <cit>  and permits the growth of all bacterial strains in a single medium thus minimizing the noise due to metabolic responses unrelated to the hrp gene regulation. for instance, rna sequencing of x. campestris pv. campestris grown in synthetic hrp gene-inducing medium mmx vs. rich medium resulted in the identification of a regulon of more than  <dig> genes mostly involved in bacterial metabolic adaptation  <cit> . in addition, increased expression in mmx was observed in only five out of  <dig> t3e genes resulting in poor predictive potential for t3e gene discovery  <cit> .

comparing the size and composition of hrp regulons is difficult because it depends on the biological system, the experimental design, the statistical analyses and the chosen cut-off values. for x. campestris pv. raphani, we intentionally selected stringent values  so that the resulting regulon is limited to  <dig> genes ,  <dig> % of which are induced. this regulon size is comparable to the reported r. solanacearum hrpb regulon  <cit>  and the p. syringae hrpl regulon  <cit>  but smaller than the regulon determined in x. campestris pv. campestris grown in synthetic hrp gene-inducing medium mmx  <cit> . in these two later examples, only  <dig> % of the genes were positively co-regulated with the t3s system genes. genes of the hrpg regulon are well conserved in x. campestris since 74% of those are detected in the  <dig> genomes inspected . importantly, all known t3e, t3sp and t3s system genes were found to belong to the x. campestris pv. raphani hrpg regulon. for instance, 34-fold induction of avrxcca <dig> expression in x. campestris pv. raphani strain cfbp 5828r upon hrpg* expression  provides the first experimental hint for avrxcca <dig> being a t3e candidate. one expects to find unknown t3e genes among the genes which expression is highly upregulated by hrpg  and among those with pip promoter motifs . this repertoire of  <dig> hrpg-induced genes, once processed with t3e prediction tools  <cit> , constitutes a manageable list to mine experimentally for novel type iii effectors in x. campestris pv. raphani.

CONCLUSIONS
a deep knowledge of the genomic diversity of x. campestris is needed to develop effective molecular typing schemes. this study presents a first genomic coverage of the pathovars of x. campestris. core- and pathovar-specific proteomes were determined as well as the repertoire of xop effector proteins that are used by bacteria to subvert plant immunity. using rna sequencing, a set of genes co-regulated with the t3s system including non-coding rnas was identified which should contribute to our understanding of the virulence strategies of this important species of phytopathogens.
