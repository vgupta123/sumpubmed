BACKGROUND
one of the major challenges in post-genomic research is to decipher and reconstruct the complete connectivity of transcriptional regulatory networks encoded by a bacterial genome sequence  <cit> . the key components in regulation of bacterial gene expression are dna-binding transcription factors that are able to sense changing environmental conditions and to modulate the expression of relevant target genes. an important prerequisite for understanding the regulation of gene expression in a bacterial cell in its entirety is the identification of the repertoire of regulatory proteins encoded by a genome sequence along with the complete set of genes that are under transcriptional control by each of the identified regulators  <cit> . the transcriptional network of the gram-negative bacterium escherichia coli is currently the best-understood regulatory system of a single cell. it includes  <dig> dna-binding transcription factors and is characterized by a hierarchical and modular architecture that is composed of eight modules with distinct physiological functions. even for this well-studied model organism, only a small fraction of the transcriptional regulatory interactions are currently known  <cit> .

the long-term objective of our post-genomic work is to characterize the complete repertoire of regulatory proteins of the gram-positive bacterium corynebacterium glutamicum along with the complete set of their target genes and corresponding dna binding sites within the known genome sequence  <cit> . since we also want to understand the evolution of the transcriptional regulatory network of c. glutamicum, we took advantage of the published genome sequences of corynebacterium efficiens  <cit> , corynebacterium diphtheriae  <cit>  and corynebacterium jeikeium  <cit>  to perform comparative genomic analyses. c. glutamicum and c. efficiens are widely used in biotechnological fermentation processes, whereas c. diphtheriae and c. jeikeium represent the most hazardous human pathogens among the corynebacteria. therefore, the four species represent attractive targets to elucidate and compare not only the complete collection of dna-binding transcriptional regulators but also the connectivity of regulatory interactions encoded by each genome sequence.

in a recent study, we have determined the complete sets of dna-binding transcriptional regulators of the four corynebacteria and have performed a comparative content analysis of these genomes  <cit> . a collection of  <dig> dna-binding transcriptional regulators was identified in the genome sequence of c. glutamicum, whereas  <dig> regulators were identified in c. efficiens,  <dig> in c. diphtheriae and  <dig> in c. jeikeium. the common set of transcriptional regulators encoded by the four corynebacterial genomes consists of only  <dig> proteins. considering functional assignments deduced from computational predictions the common dna-binding transcriptional regulators were grouped into five modules with distinct physiological functions  <cit> . the functional module "macroelement and metal homeostasis" includes, for instance, the transcriptional regulator mcbr, directing the global regulation of almost all aspects of sulphur metabolism, a furb homolog, most likely involved in regulation of zinc metabolism  <cit> , and a transcriptional regulator that is homologous to the diphtheria toxin repressor dtxr of c. diphtheriae  <cit> . the c. glutamicum dtxr protein shares 71% identical amino acid residues with the orthologous counterpart of c. diphtheriae.

the diphtheria toxin repressor dtxr has been shown to be a global transcriptional regulator of iron metabolism in c. diphtheriae  <cit> . iron is essential for a variety of cellular processes in virtually all organisms, since it plays important roles as enzyme cofactor or as integral part of cytochromes in oxidation-reduction and energy-generating systems  <cit> . on the other hand, iron poses problems in biological systems since the oxidized form is poorly soluble and the reduced form is highly toxic. therefore, bacteria have evolved various mechanisms to counter these problems and to achieve an effective iron homeostasis. in addition, expression of the iron homeostatic machinery is subject to iron-dependent transcriptional regulation, for instance of genes encoding high-affinity iron uptake systems, intracellular iron storage proteins, redox-stress resistance systems, and iron-containing proteins to control overall iron consumption of the cell  <cit> . in c. diphtheriae, almost  <dig> binding sites of dtxr have been identified either by targeted genetic experiments or by a global repressor titration assay  <cit> . major physiological functions that are controlled by dtxr in response to the iron level include the expression of the diphtheria toxin  <cit> , the synthesis and export of siderophores  <cit> , the siderophore-dependent uptake of iron  <cit> , and the synthesis of specific systems for the utilization of iron from heme, hemin and hemoglobin  <cit> .

in the present study, we have characterized the regulon of the transcriptional regulator dtxr of c. glutamicum by a genome-wide approach using dna microarray technology. this global strategy along with bioinformatics predictions permitted the identification of dtxr binding sites in the c. glutamicum genome sequence along with a set of target genes that are under direct transcriptional control by dtxr. binding of purified his-tagged dtxr protein to the upstream region of the respective genes was verified in vitro by dna band shift assays. the resulting data were used for a comparative analysis of the deduced dtxr regulons in the four sequenced corynebacterial species.

RESULTS
phenotypic characterization of the dtxr mutant strain c. glutamicum ib2103
the cg <dig>  gene of c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> encodes a transcriptional regulator with significant amino acid sequence similarity to the diphtheria toxin repressor dtxr of c. diphtheriae  <cit> . to explore the regulatory network controlled by the dtxr protein of c. glutamicum, a defined deletion was established in the coding region of dtxr by applying a gene replacement strategy  <cit>  that finally resulted in the mutant strain c. glutamicum ib <dig>  subsequently, growth assays with c. glutamicum ib <dig> were performed in liquid cgxii minimal medium and growth of the cultures was monitored by nephelometry . growth assays with the wild-type strain c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> served as control. the growth assays clearly showed that c. glutamicum ib <dig> containing the dtxr gene deletion was unable to grow in cgxii minimal medium. on the other hand, the dtxr mutant revealed the same growth characteristics as the wild-type strain when cultivated in low-iron cgxii medium . the growth deficiency of c. glutamicum ib <dig> in cgxii minimal medium was complemented by transformation with plasmid pib <dig> carrying the cloned dtxr gene. control assays with c. glutamicum ib <dig> containing the empty cloning vector pec-xk99e failed to complement the phenotype of the mutant . these data demonstrate that the defined deletion of dtxr in c. glutamicum ib <dig> resulted in a conditionally lethal phenotype apparently depending on the amount of iron that is supplied with the synthetic culture medium. this distinct phenotype of c. glutamicum ib <dig> was suited to perform comparative transcriptomic studies with the wild-type strain to identify genes that belong to the transcriptional regulatory network of dtxr.

genome-wide transcriptional profiling of the dtxr mutant c. glutamicum ib <dig> in comparison to the wild-type strain atcc  <dig> by dna microarray hybridization
to identify genes that are differentially expressed in the transcriptome of c. glutamicum ib <dig>  the global gene expression pattern of the dtxr mutant was compared with that of the wild-type strain by dna microarray hybridization. since c. glutamicum ib <dig> was unable to grow in cgxii minimal medium , both strains were cultivated in shaking flasks to mid-exponential growth phase by using low-iron cgxii medium. the cultures revealed a very similar growth behavior that was characterized by almost identical doubling times of the dtxr mutant  and the wild-type , indicating that differences in growth of both strains were apparently minimized under the selected cultivation conditions. at the time when the c. glutamicum strains were grown to an optical density of four ,  <dig> mg/l feso <dig> was added to the growth medium, and the cultures were cultivated for further  <dig> min before harvesting cells and preparing total rna. addition of iron to the wild-type culture should result in a "switch-off" of expression of those genes that are part of the dtxr regulon, whereas the respective genes should be further on expressed in the dtxr mutant c. glutamicum ib <dig>  therefore, genes revealing an enhanced expression in c. glutamicum ib <dig> when compared to the wild-type are candidates that might belong to the transcriptional regulatory network of dtxr.

cell samples for total rna preparation were taken from two independently grown c. glutamicum cultures of each strain. the respective rna preparations were used in two dna microarray hybridization assays by applying label swapping. labeling of probes and dna microarray hybridization were carried out as described previously  <cit> . to minimize the number of false-positive signals, the data were stringently filtered to obtain genes with at least six statistically significant values out of the eight technical replicates present on the two microarrays along with an error probability of less than 5% for the student's t-test. normalization of the hybridization data by the lowess function and t-test statistics were accomplished by the emma software package. the resulting ratio/intensity  plot of the normalized data is presented in figure  <dig> 

by applying a ratio cut-off of Â±  <dig>  corresponding to relative expression changes equal or greater than twofold, a total of  <dig> genes revealed a differential expression in c. glutamicum ib <dig> . this number includes  <dig> genes with significantly increased expression in c. glutamicum ib <dig> when compared to the wild-type strain  and  <dig> genes with decreased expression in the dtxr mutant . several genes showing derepression of transcription in c. glutamicum ib <dig> when compared to the wild-type strain encode iron-containing proteins and proteins that are apparently involved in iron transport and metabolism . consequently, the upstream regions of the respective genes were ideally suited to search for the presence of a common dtxr binding motif.

computational identification of potential dtxr binding sites in the genome sequence of c. glutamicum atcc 13032
to identify dtxr binding sites in the genome sequence of c. glutamicum, the upstream regions of  <dig> differentially expressed genes encoding proteins involved in iron metabolism were selected  and aligned by using the clustal x program  <cit> . the alignment identified a common 19-bp dna motif with the palindromic consensus sequence 5'-ttaggttagctaacctaa-3' that is identical to dtxr binding sites identified earlier in c. diphtheriae  <cit> . a clustal x alignment of the 19-bp motifs was used to create a hidden markov model , and the c. glutamicum genome sequence was searched for the presence of additional motifs with this hmm profile. the results generated by hmm searches were then compared with the genomic positions of genes that showed differential expression in the dtxr mutant c. glutamicum ib <dig> during dna microarray hybridization. this bioinformatics approach identified  <dig> motifs in front of genes that were identified as differentially expressed by dna microarray hybridization, including the  <dig> motifs initially used as seed information to create the hmm profile . it is noteworthy that three 19-bp motifs were predicted in front of genes  that showed a decreased expression in the dtxr mutant c. glutamicum ib <dig> . the bioinformatics search identified additional  <dig> motifs upstream of genes that were not detected during the dna microarray hybridization experiment. these motifs either represent false-positive predictions or might be related to genes that were not detected with significant values during dna microarray hybridization . accordingly, a total number of  <dig> potential dtxr binding sites was identified in the c. glutamicum genome sequence by bioinformatics analysis and further on investigated experimentally. especially genes that showed an enhanced or decreased expression in the dtxr mutant c. glutamicum ib <dig> and that are moreover characterized by the presence of a predicted binding site within the corresponding upstream region can be considered as candidates for direct transcriptional regulation by dtxr.

verification of differential expression of genes with predicted dtxr binding sites by real-time rt-pcr experiments
differential expression of the  <dig> genes identified by bioinformatics screening of the c. glutamicum genome sequence for the presence of dtxr binding sites was examined further by real-time rt-pcr assays using the same experimental setup as applied for dna microarray hybridizations. the resulting data are summarized in table  <dig>  the real-time rt-pcr assays demonstrated that the expression of  <dig> genes was enhanced up to 2000-fold in the dtxr mutant c. glutamicum ib <dig> when compared with the wild-type strain. accordingly, the results can be divided into three categories:  differential expression in c. glutamicum ib <dig> of the  <dig> genes initially identified by the dna microarray experiment was confirmed by the rt-pcr approach.  among the genes additionally predicted by hmm searches seven showed indeed a differential expression in the dtxr mutant strain c. glutamicum ib <dig>  expression of four genes was enhanced only up to 5-fold, and a further examination of the dna microarray data indicated that at least two of the respective ratios were close to the experimental cut-off .  in the case of nine potential motifs, the prediction by the hmm profile was most likely false-positive, since the corresponding genes showed no significant changes of the expression level in c. glutamicum ib <dig>  neither by dna microarray hybridization nor by real-time rt-pcr measurements. consequently, the combination of dna microarray hybridization, bioinformatics screening approaches and real-time rt-pcr assays led to a set of genes that are differentially expressed in the dtxr mutant c. glutamicum ib <dig> and that are characterized by a putative dtxr binding site within the upstream region.

binding of purified dtxr protein to the identified sequence motifs as analyzed by dna band shift assays
to demonstrate binding of the dtxr regulator to the predicted 19-bp motifs by dna band shift assays, a modified dtxr protein was constructed and subsequently purified. for this purpose, the coding region of the dtxr gene was fused with a 3' extension encoding six histidine residues and amplified by pcr. the resulting dna fragment was cloned in e. coli into the expression vector pec-xk99e  <cit>  resulting in plasmid pib <dig> that is suitable for heterologous overexpression of the modified dtxr protein upon iptg induction. the his-tagged dtxr protein was purified to homogeneity from an induced e. coli culture by means of ni-ted columns and positively identified by maldi-tof mass spectrometry and peptide mass fingerprinting . moreover, plasmid pib <dig> was transferred into the dtxr mutant c. glutamicum ib <dig> by electroporation to prove that the his-tagged dtxr protein is functional in vivo. this control experiment demonstrated that the growth deficiency of the dtxr mutant c. glutamicum ib <dig> in cgxii minimal medium can be complemented by plasmid pib <dig> but not by the empty cloning vector pec-xk99e .

subsequently, dna band shift assays were carried out with the purified his-tagged dtxr protein and distinct dna fragments containing each of the  <dig> predicted 19-bp motifs. for this purpose, the motifs were extended on both sides with the respective gene-specific sequences to a total length of  <dig> nucleotides. these  <dig> mer oligonucoletides were labeled with cy <dig> and annealed to produce double-stranded dna fragments that were applied in band shift assays. first of all,  <dig>  pmol of the labeled  <dig> mer dna fragment representing the predicted dtxr binding site upstream of cg <dig> was incubated with different amounts of his-tagged dtxr protein . the assays were then separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by fluorescence imaging . apparently, the presence of purified dtxr protein caused a different electrophoretic mobility of the labeled dna fragment even at the low protein concentration of  <dig> pmol. furthermore, dna band shift assays were performed with labeled  <dig> mer control fragments located within the coding region of cg <dig> and cg <dig> , respectively. incubation of purified dtxr protein with these dna fragments delivered no band shift . binding of the dtxr protein to the upstream region of cg <dig> was also analyzed by dna displacement experiments, in which increasing concentrations of the same non-labeled  <dig> mer fragment  were added to the band shift assay. increasing concentrations of this sequence-specific competitor prevented the dna band shift caused by the purified dtxr protein . these data suggested a specific binding of the dtxr regulator to the upstream region of cg <dig> containing the common 19-bp motif.

subsequent dna band shift assays were performed with  <dig> pmol of purified dtxr protein . the presence of purified dtxr protein caused a band shift of almost all tested  <dig> mer dna fragments, with exception of a  <dig> mer region located in front of the cg <dig> gene that encodes the arsr-type regulatory protein ripa  <cit> . the reason for this observation is currently unknown since binding of the dtxr protein to the upstream region of cg <dig> was described earlier  <cit> . nevertheless, the dna band shift assays confirmed in vitro the binding of the dtxr regulator to specific dna fragments containing the common 19-bp motif that was identified in the upstream region of differentially expressed genes.

localization of dtxr binding sites in mapped promoter regions of differentially expressed genes
to determine the position of verified dtxr binding sites in relation to the promoter region of the respective genes, transcriptional start sites were identified by using the 5' race method. transcriptional starts were determined for the genes cg <dig>  cg <dig> and cg <dig> that showed an enhanced expression in the dtxr mutant c. glutamicum ib <dig> and for the cg <dig>  cg <dig> and cg <dig> genes that revealed a decreased expression. the detected transcriptional start sites were identified in variable distances to the annotated translational starts of the corresponding proteins . the transcriptional start sites of cg <dig>  cg <dig> and cg <dig> were identical to the adenine residue of the annotated translational start codons. these results provided evidence for the presence of leaderless transcripts that are known to occur in c. glutamicum  <cit> . moreover, the determination of transcriptional start points provided the basis for the identification of potential - <dig> and - <dig> promoter regions, according to the known features of corynebacterial promoter sequences  <cit> . at least three nuclotides of the potential - <dig> and - <dig> hexamers were identical to the consensus sequences ttgcca and taaat, respectively. in the case of cg <dig>  cg <dig> and cg <dig> the verified dtxr binding sites were located within the deduced promoter region , which is consistent with the physiological role of the dtxr protein as transcriptional repressor of gene expression. on the other hand, the dtxr binding sites of cg <dig>  cg <dig> and cg <dig> were located upstream of the deduced - <dig> promoter regions . since expression of these genes decreased in the dtxr mutant c. glutamicum ib <dig>  as measured by dna microarray hybridization and real-time rt-pcr, the location of the dtxr binding sites would be more consistent with an activating function of the dtxr protein  <cit> .

bioinformatics characterization and functional dissection of the dtxr regulon of c. glutamicum
the  <dig> genes, which were characterized by differential expression pattern in the dtxr mutant c. glutamicum ib <dig> and by the presence of a dtxr binding site in front of the coding region, only represent a part of the dtxr regulon since operon structures also have to be considered. therefore, the genetic organization of the respective gene regions was analyzed by using the annotation of the c. glutamicum genome sequence as visualized by the gendb database system  <cit> . this genome annotation contains bioinformatics predictions of rho-independent transcriptional terminators that were generated by the sofware tool transterm  <cit> . an inspection of the genome sequence for the presence of transcriptional terminators in the downstream regions of genes that are regulated by dtxr finally resulted in the identification of twelve gene clusters or operons . taking these bioinformatics predictions into account along with the functional annotation of the differentially expressed genes, at least  <dig> genes appeared to be directly regulated by the dtxr protein. the respective genes and gene clusters of the c. glutamicum genome as well as dna microarray hybridization data regarding the differential expression in the dtxr mutant c. glutamicum ib <dig> are shown in figure  <dig> 

the genes belonging to the dtxr regulon of c. glutamicum can be divided into seven functional categories  according to the predicted physiological roles of the deduced proteins  <cit> . the functional classification yielded a prominent group of  <dig> genes that encode iron transport systems or siderophore interacting proteins. accordingly, this functional category includes almost half of the genes that are under direct transcriptional control by dtxr. additionally, the genes cg <dig> , cg <dig>  and cg <dig>  were identified as part of the dtxr regulon of c. glutamicum. the respective proteins specify the heme oxygenase hmuo involved in the release of iron from the heme moiety  <cit> , a putative ferritin most likely involved in iron storage  <cit>  and a dps homolog that can act either in iron storage or as dna-protecting anti-redox agent  <cit> . expression of the ftn and dps genes was decreased in the dtxr mutant c. glutamicum ib <dig> as was the expression of the sdh gene cluster that encodes the components of the iron-containing succinate dehydrogenase complex of c. glutamicum  <cit> . the genes belonging to other categories of the dtxr regulon encode proteins without a precise functional prediction, secreted proteins of unknown function or even hypothetical proteins , with the exception of the cgl gene cluster that represents the main dna restriction and modification system of c. glutamicum atcc  <dig>  <cit>  and the cysi-fpr <dig> gene region involved in assimilatory sulphate reduction  <cit> .

among the set of regulatory genes that are under direct control by dtxr, three dna-binding transcriptional regulators were identified. this set includes the cg <dig>  gene that was recently shown to be involved in iron metabolism of c. glutamicum  <cit>  as well as the cg <dig> and cg <dig> genes encoding members of the arsr family of regulatory proteins that typically exert metal-dependent transcriptional regulations in bacterial cells  <cit> . these data clearly indicate that the dtxr protein not only regulates the expression of genes playing a direct role in iron metabolism of c. glutamicum but also that of genes encoding transcriptional regulators, which can direct the expression of further target genes at another level of regulatory hierarchy.

genome-wide identification of putative dtxr binding sites in corynebacterial genome sequences and comparative content analysis of the deduced dtxr regulons
since genes encoding a dtxr homolog are highly conserved in corynebacteria  <cit> , the deduced genetic and functional composition of the dtxr regulon of c. glutamicum was compared with dtxr regulons that were predicted by bioinformatics analysis of the genome sequences of c. efficiens  <cit> , c. diphtheriae  <cit>  and c. jeikeium  <cit> . a multiple nucleotide sequence alignment of the  <dig> verified 19-bp motifs of c. glutamicum provided the seed information to create a hmm profile that was used to search for the presence of dtxr binding sites in the corynebacterial genome sequences. the resulting hits were applied to generate species-specific hmms, and the genome sequences were searched again for the presence of potential dtxr binding sites with the respective profiles. this iterative approach resulted in the prediction of  <dig> dtxr binding sites in the genome sequence of c. efficiens, whereas  <dig> dtxr binding sites were detected in the genome sequence of c. diphtheriae and  <dig> in that of c. jeikeium . with respect to the genome annotations and the bioinformatics prediction of gene clusters at least  <dig> genes might be under direct transcriptional control by dtxr in c. efficiens,  <dig> in c. diphtheriae and  <dig> in c. jeikeium .

 <dig> c. diphtheriae genes described previously as part of the dtxr regulon  <cit> 

 <dig> two dtxr binding sites were identified in front of the coding region.

 <dig> a single dtxr binding site is involved most likely in regulation of adjacent coding regions located on the opposite dna strand  <cit> .

moreover, the identified 19-bp motifs were used to generate species-specific consensus sequences of the dtxr binding sites by means of the weblogo tool  <cit> . the resulting sequence logos are shown in figure 6a. the overall height of each stack of letters indicates the sequence conservation at each position of the 19-bp motif, wheras the heigth of each symbol within the stack reflects the relative frequency of the corresponding nucleotide at that position. a comparison of the sequence logos clearly indicated that the four 19-bp motifs resemble the overall palindromic consensus sequence 5'-ttaggttagctaacctaa-3' of dtxr binding sites, with apparent species-specific variations . accordingly, the sequenced corynebacterial genomes not only encode a conserved dtxr homolog but also contain sets of similar 19-bp motifs that represent potential dtxr binding sites. these data along with the verified dtxr binding sites of c. glutamicum and the annotated genome sequences of c. efficiens, c. diphtheriae and c. jeikeium enabled us to analyze and compare the genetic composition of the dtxr regulons in these corynebacterial species.

to identify either species-specific or common genes that are under transcriptional control by dtxr in corynebacteria, functional predictions of the coding regions located downstream of the determined dtxr binding sites were compared between the four sequenced species. orthologous proteins were identified within the complete collection of potentially dtxr-regulated genes by using the blastp algorithm  <cit>  to detect amino acid sequence similarities and by performing synteny analyses of the respective genomic context. the resulting data were visualized as venn diagrams . first of all, it is apparent that the four corynebacteria share no common gene that is under direct transcriptional control by the dtxr regulator. this unexpected result might be due to the exceptional collection of species-specific genes that are involved in iron metabolism of c. jeikeium  <cit> . the set of orthologous genes that are most likely under transcriptional regulation by dtxr in three corynebacterial species includes the orthologs of the cg <dig> gene cluster  that encode components of an iron abc transport system in c. glutamicum, c. diphtheriae and c. jeikeium and the orthologs of the cg <dig> gene cluster that are apparently involved in iron uptake in c. glutamicum, c. efficiens and c. jeikeium. orthologs of the sdh gene cluster and the ftn gene, whose expression decreased in the dtxr mutant c. glutamicum ib <dig>  are apparently under direct transcriptional control by dtxr in c. efficiens and c. diphtheriae, indicating that the dtxr regulator might be involved in the activation of gene expression also in these species. regulatory genes orthologous with cg <dig> of c. glutamicum are present in the genomes of c. efficiens and c. diphtheriae  <cit>  and all are presumably regulated by dtxr, suggesting similar hierarchical topologies of the respective dtxr regulons. however, most of the identified genes that are under transcriptional control by dtxr are species-specific, although one has to keep in mind that some non-orthologous genes might share similar physiological functions. this comparative content analysis led to the conclusion that the dtxr regulons of corynebacteria are quite different in their genetic composition, although they rely on an orthologous regulatory protein and similar 19-bp motifs for regulator binding. nevertheless, some interesting regulatory features deduced from the experimental characterization of the dtxr regulon of c. glutamicum are apparently realized also in the topology of dtxr regulons of other corynebacteria.

discussion
in the present study, the genetic network of the transcriptional regulator dtxr was examined in c. glutamicum, and the topology of the dtxr regulon was deduced from dna microarray hybridizations, bioinformatics approaches, in vivo studies of differential gene expression, and dna band shift assays. for these purposes, a defined deletion was constructed within the coding region of the dtxr gene, resulting in the mutant strain c. glutamicum ib <dig> that was unable to grow in cgxii minimal medium under high-iron conditions. however, when the dtxr mutant c. glutamicum ib <dig> was cultivated in low-iron cgxii medium, it revealed the same growth behavior as the wild-type control. these experiments showed that the dtxr gene is dispensable in c. glutamicum under specific culture conditions, as it was previously demonstrated for the orthologous regulatory genes dtxr, dmdr <dig> and ider of c. diphtheriae, streptomyces coelicolor and mycobacterium smegmatis, respectively  <cit> . on the other hand, the ider gene of mycobacterium tuberculosis can be inactivated only in the presence of a second functional copy of the gene or when a second-site suppressor mutation alleviates the lethal effects of ider inactivation, making ider an essential gene in this bacterial species  <cit> .

as observed with the defined dtxr mutant strain c. glutamicum ib <dig>  growth of the dtxr transposon mutant c <dig>  of c. diphtheriae was dependent on the amount of iron that was added to the culture medium  <cit> . the c <dig>  mutant of c. diphtheriae exhibited an extended lag phase and slower exponential growth in low-iron medium when compared with the parental c <dig> wild-type strain. moreover, the c <dig>  mutant grew only poorly in high-iron medium when compared with a control medium containing no additional iron sources, and it was more-easily killed by exposure to high-iron conditions and h2o <dig> than was the parental strain  <cit> . since the dtxr protein apparently regulates the expression of iron uptake systems, it might also be involved in protecting the cell from damage that is caused by high intracellular iron concentrations. transcriptional deregulation of iron homeostasis favors the fenton reaction, leading to the production of hydroxyl radicals that can damage all biological macromolecules  <cit> . therefore, transcriptional regulation of iron metabolism by the dtxr protein in c. glutamicum is not only necessary for economic reasons but also to avoid inevitable iron toxicity. in e. coli, iron homeostasis and oxidative stress response are closely interconnected and strictly controlled by the transcriptional regulator fur  <cit> . inactivation of the fur gene enhanced the sensitivity of the cell to redox stress, a physiological effect that can be reversed by iron chelation, by inhibiting ferric iron transport or by enhancing the iron storage capacity of the cell  <cit> .

the dtxr mutant c. glutamicum ib <dig> was further on used to compare the genome-wide expression pattern with that of the wild-type strain by dna microarray hybridizations. in principle, inactivation of a gene encoding a repressor results in constitutive expression of those genes that are directly regulated by the respective protein. therefore, comparative dna microarray hybridizations are typically carried out in such a way that the relevant genes of the wild-type control are repressed and those of the mutant strain are de-repressed  <cit> . since the dtxr mutant c. glutamicum ib <dig> grew only in low-iron medium containing a trace amout of iron, the genes of the dtxr regulon are apparently de-repressed in both the mutant strain and the wild-type control. to detect differential gene expression in c. glutamicum ib <dig>  we applied an alternative experimental setup by the subsequent addition of an appropriate amount of iron to low-iron growth medium. indeed, the dtxr repressor switched off the expression of its target genes in the wild-type strain, whereas the target genes were further on expressed in the dtxr mutant. this physiological effect was detectable on a global scale by dna microarray experiments and enabled the screening for differentially expressed genes that were later on assigned to the dtxr regulon of c. glutamicum. in addition to genes belonging to the dtxr regulon, the dna microarray hybridization identified numerous coding regions whose expression was positively or negatively influenced in response to the iron stimulus. these genes are considered to be subject to indirect regulation by iron and are apparently not part of the dtxr regulon of c. glutamicum since they lack dtxr binding sites in their upstream regions. investigating the physiological role of these genes in the cellular response to the subsequent addition of iron might eventually allow a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms used by c. glutamicum to counter high-iron conditions.

furthermore, the combination of bioinformatics predictions and dna band shift assays resulted in the identification of dtxr binding sites within the upstream region of  <dig> genes and gene clusters, suggesting that at least  <dig> genes are under direct transcriptional control by dtxr in c. glutamicum. for a closer examination of the identified dtxr binding sites, transcriptional start sites of four differentially expressed genes were determined and the corresponding promoters were mapped. three dtxr binding sites were found to overlap the deduced promoter regions, suggesting that dtxr acts as transcriptional repressor by blocking rna polymerase binding and thus preventing expression of the respective genes  <cit> . similar results were reported upon promoter mapping and localization of dtxr binding sites in c. diphtheriae  <cit>  and of ider binding sites in m. smegmatis and m. tuberculosis  <cit> . on the other hand, the dtxr binding sites of cg <dig>  cg <dig> and cg <dig> were located upstream of the deduced - <dig> promoter region. since the respective genes showed a decreased expression in c. glutamicum ib <dig> during dna microarray hybridization, this location is more consistent with an activating function of the corresponding transcriptional regulator  <cit> . in general, transcriptional regulators activate the expression of genes in such a way that they facilitate interaction of the rna polymerase with the respective promoters. however, the large distance of the dtxr binding site to the - <dig> promoter region of the cg <dig> gene cluster that encodes the iron-containing succinate dehydrogenase complex of c. glutamicum suggests an alternative activation mechanism. in this context it is noteworthy that the cg <dig> gene cluster is also under direct transcriptional control by the ripa repressor  <cit> , a member of the arac-family of dna-binding transcriptional regulators  <cit> . some members of the arac protein family fulfill their regulatory function by using two dna binding sites and a dna looping mechanism to control gene expression  <cit> . the dtxr binding site in front of cg <dig> is located directly adjacent to the ripa binding site a, and dtxr binding might therefore interfere with ripa binding to exert its regulatory function. since expression of the ripa gene is also controlled by dtxr, the corresponding network topology of the dtxr regulon represents a coherent feed-forward loop of type  <dig>  in which the direct connection to the target gene is activating and the indirect connections are both repressing  <cit> . in such a way environmental input signals can be integrated into the transcriptional regulatory network at different levels of regulatory hierarchy to control expression of the succinate dehydrogenase complex.

in addition to the cg <dig> gene cluster, the dps  and ftn  genes showed a decreased expression in the dtxr mutant c. glutamicum ib <dig>  dps-like proteins may function either as anti-redox agents or iron storage proteins, whereas ferritins act primarily in iron storage  <cit> . these data indicated that the dtxr protein can exert a regulatory role as positive modulator of expression of genes that are involved in iron storage and dna protection. this mechanism of transcriptional regulation is reasonable since the iron storage and protection genes are not expressed under low-iron conditions, whereas both, the iron storage capacity of the cell and the protection of dna, increase under high-iron conditions by activating the respective genes. in m. tuberculosis, expression of the iron storage genes bfra and bfrb, encoding a bacterioferritin and a ferritin-like protein, is induced also by iron and ider  <cit> . binding of ider to the regulatory region of bfra indicated that the gene is transcribed from a promoter that is activated by iron and binding of ider, since induction of bfra gene expression was detected in the wild-type but not in an ider mutant strain. the transcriptional control of iron storage in e. coli was also shown to be positively regulated by iron but no direct interaction of fur with the regulatory region of the bfra and ftn genes has been observed  <cit> .

the comparative content analysis of dtxr binding sites in four corynebacterial genome sequences provided further insights into the topology of the dtxr regulon of c. glutamicum. the deduced consensus sequences of dtxr binding sites are not only very similar among the corynebacterial species but also resemble ider and dmdr <dig> binding sites that were detected in m. tuberculosis and s. coelicolor, respectively  <cit> . consequently, dtxr-like regulatory proteins utilize conserved recognition signals in different actinobacteria, as is the situation with dna binding sites of the fur repressor in gamma-proteobacteria  <cit> . on the other hand, the comparative content analysis revealed that most of the dtxr-regulated genes are species-specific in the four sequenced corynebacteria, indicating that a wide variety of genetic information is used in the individual species to provide an effective iron homeostasis. varying genetic information can be gained for instance by horizontal gene transfer, as suggested for the c. jeikeium genome that contains large sets of dtxr-regulated iron acquisition genes on mobile genetic elements  <cit> . as iron metabolism is closely connected to iron toxicity, any additional genetic information regarding iron metabolism has to be integrated into the pre-existing dtxr regulon to avoid detrimental consequences for the bacterial cell. only in case of similar dna binding sites being present in the regulatory region of the respective genes, it is generally ensured that the genes fall under direct regulation by the dtxr protein and that the bacterium can benefit from the acquired genetic information. the close functional relationship between dna binding sites of at least dtxr and ider is indeed apparent from the observation that the regulatory proteins can interact with operators of the cognate regulons in either corynebacteria or mycobacteria  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the presented experimental work adds considerably to our currrent understanding of the transcriptional regulatory network of c. glutamicum genes that are controlled by the diphtheria toxin repressor homolog dtxr and of the response of this bacterium to changing environmental iron levels. the results demonstrate that dtxr acts as a dual transcriptional regulator with a major role in controlling the expression of genes involved in iron metabolism. the dtxr protein exerts its dual regulatory function as repressor of genes participating in iron uptake and iron utilization and as activator of genes responsible for iron storage and dna protection. moreover, the data suggest that the dtxr protein acts as global regulator by controlling the expression of other regulatory proteins that might take care of an iron-dependent regulation of a broader transcriptional network of c. glutamicum genes.
