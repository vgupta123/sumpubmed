BACKGROUND
as the number of completely sequenced microbial genomes grows, the need for efficient annotation tools becomes more acute. gene-finding programs such as genemark or glimmer  <cit>  can predict protein coding regions at a generally high level of accuracy. however, there also are genes encoding rrna, trna and small non-coding rnas in prokaryotic genomes, which these methods may not always find. the precise locations of translation and transcription start sites also need to be identified. better understanding of the attributes associated with promoters, in addition to shedding light on the basic mechanisms by which they function, will also assist in identifying these sites within genomic sequences.

promoter prediction in prokaryotic genomes presents unique challenges owing to their organizational properties. first, gene densities are very high in prokaryotes – 89% of the base pairs in the e. coli genome are in open reading frames . neighboring genes may have very short intergenic regions; in some cases their coding regions even overlap. further, the operon structure, in which multiple genes are transcribed as a single transcription unit, means that not all genes require their own promoters. in order for bacteria to thrive in different environments, their genomic sequences are highly adaptive within genomes and highly diversified across genomes. this makes it difficult to detect conserved regulatory sites within and across genomes by sequence homology. these factors have complicated the search for the determinants of promoter activity in prokaryotes.

prokaryotic promoters are known to contain conserved sequence motifs, which may be represented either as consensus sequences or by position-specific score matrices   <cit> . for example, most e. coli k <dig> promoters contain approximately conserved sequence elements in their - <dig> and - <dig> regions  <cit> . the - <dig> motif is essential for transcription initiation, while the - <dig> motif is dispensable for some promoters. other sequence features of e. coli k <dig> promoters include the a+t rich up element located around position - <dig>  <cit> . most of the promoter prediction programs thus far developed search sequences for conserved - <dig> motifs, and in some cases also include - <dig> motifs  <cit> . these methods commonly suffer from high false positive rates.

local separation of the dna duplex within promoter regions is a critical step in transcriptional initiation for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. this step must be highly regulated, but does not occur as a strictly thermal melting. instead, the untwisting torsional stresses imposed on genomic dna by in vivo negative superhelicity destabilize the dna duplex in specific regions, and thereby facilitate local strand opening. we have developed statistical mechanical methods to analyze this stress-induced dna duplex destabilization  within complete chromosomes. for a specified level of superhelicity, we calculate two quantities for each base pair – the probability of its opening, and the incremental free energy g needed to force it to be always open under these conditions  <cit> . a small number of specific sites in genomic dna are predicted by sidd analysis to have a high propensity to melt under normal physiological conditions. we have demonstrated that these sidd sites in the e. coli k <dig> genome are statistically significantly associated with intergenic regions that are known or inferred to contain promoters. it is found that many – but not every – documented promoter contains a strong sidd site. further, sidd sites also occur at frequencies much below expectation in coding regions  <cit> . this pattern of sidd site distribution has recently been confirmed to occur in many other prokaryotic genomes  <cit> . this suggests that sidd properties may be used to identify and investigate promoter-containing regions in prokaryotic genomes.

in this report we show that sidd is a distinct structural property of promoter regions that cannot be identified by sequence conservation. there is no one-to-one correspondence between local attributes of the sequence and the extent of destabilization, and no unique sequence motifs are involved. when compared with other known dna structural properties and with - <dig> motif scores, sidd properties are found to be the best discriminator for distinguishing promoters from non-promoters. when sidd was either the sole predictor or was combined with other features in a promoter prediction program, high levels of sensitivity and specificity were achieved. we present two approaches for annotating promoter locations in sequenced prokaryotic genomes.

RESULTS
sidd is a distinct structural property in promoter regions that cannot be captured by sequence conservation
we first performed a sidd analysis of the entire e. coli k <dig> genome, as described in the methods section. then three sets of regions were selected according to their transcriptional properties, and their sidd attributes were compared. to construct the first set we randomly selected  <dig> documented transcription start sites  from the  <dig> that are annotated in the regulon database for the e. coli k <dig> genome  <cit> . for each of these tsss, we found the  <dig> bp sequence centered on that tss. the regions immediately upstream from these tsss were considered to be promoters, which hence would be contained in these regions. for comparison we selected two other sets for analysis, each also containing  <dig> sequences that are  <dig> bp long, that are chosen to contain few or no promoters. each sequence in the second set starts at one of the tsss chosen above, and extends  <dig> bp in the direction of transcription. this is called the coding set of sequences. the third set consists of  <dig> randomly selected sequences, each  <dig> bp long, centered on an intergenic region separating convergently oriented genes. this set, which we call con, may contain parts of orfs, but is inferred not to contain promoters. we also constructed a fourth set of random sequence dna as follows. we randomly shuffled the entire e. coli k <dig> genome to preserve the mononucleotide compositions, and performed a sidd analysis on the entire resulting sequence. then a set of  <dig> sequences, each  <dig> bp long, was chosen at random from this shuffled genome, and their sidd attributes were compared with those of the sequences in the other three sets.

first, for each of these sets we determined the average value of the destabilization free energy g that occurs at each position within the  <dig> bp sequence.  corresponds to the incremental free energy needed for the base pair at position x to always remain open. highly destabilized sites have low values of g; sites that are open in all low energy states can even have negative values.) these calculated position-specific average values are shown in figure 1a. on average, the sequences containing promoters are more destabilized than either the coding sequences or the con sequences that may not contain promoters. these results agree with those from our previous analysis, which showed strong sidd sites to be statistically significantly associated with intergenic regions whose bounding orfs are either divergently or tandemly oriented, and hence may contain promoters or other transcriptional regulatory elements  <cit> . the lowest average value of g occurs around position - <dig> relative to the tss, a region previously identified as the up element in some e. coli k <dig> promoters. statistical analysis shows the regions between positions - <dig> and + <dig> are significantly destabilized  when compared with either of the two sets that do not contain promoters, or with the randomly shuffled sequences.

in what follows we designate the  <dig> bp sequence from positions - <dig> to + <dig> relative to each of the  <dig> chosen tsss as containing a promoter.  these  <dig> promoter sequences were aligned at their tsss, and their sequence conservation was measured by shannon's entropy  <cit> . the result is shown in figure 1b. as expected, a slight entropy decrease  was observed between positions - <dig> and - <dig>  which are their - <dig> regions. however, there was no significant entropy decrease at the - <dig> regions, indicating that on average the local sequence is not more conserved at this location than elsewhere in these promoters. it is known that the - <dig> motif is dispensable for so-called "extended -10" sigma  <dig> promoters. strikingly, the region around - <dig> bp where the maximal average destabilization was found also shows no increase in sequence conservation. this indicates that sidd properties and - <dig> motifs are fundamentally different attributes of promoters; one is tied directly to the base sequence but the other is not.

a recent paper that presented a promoter prediction method based on thermostability in promoter regions reported that the region from - <dig> to - <dig> was much less stable than were other, non-promoter locations  <cit> . it is possible that the decreased thermostability in this region was partly due to the conserved - <dig> sequence motif, which is a+t-rich.

this result emphasizes the fact that sidd properties are fundamentally different from thermostability. sidd does not depend only on the local thermal properties of the dna sequence. the energies that govern sidd are the differences between the energy cost of strand separation for the specific base pairs involved, and the energy benefit from the fractional relaxation of the superhelical stress this transition provides. the thermal energy only relates to the cost half of this relationship. moreover, superhelical stresses couple together all the base pairs that experience them, so whether sidd melting occurs at any specific location depends on how well that site competes with all others that feel this stress. this means a site can open at one level of stress, then re-close coupled to opening elsewhere as the stresses are increased.  this type of complicated, nonlinear behavior does not occur in thermal melting, and cannot be predicted only from the thermal properties of the sequence.

construction of training and test sets
all the analyses that follow used three training sets, each of which contains  <dig> sequences that are  <dig> bp long. the promoter-containing training set, described above, consists of sequences spanning positions - <dig> to + <dig> relative to each of the  <dig> selected tsss. in each of the  <dig> con sequences described above we selected the central  <dig> bp, which are centered in the middle of their intergenic regions. as these regions are short and separate convergently transcribing orfs, they are inferred not to contain promoters. henceforth we describe this as the con training set. the third training set consists of the  <dig> base pair sequences between position + <dig> and + <dig> within each of the  <dig> bp coding sequences described above. this set, which is sometimes referred to as the coding training set, also is inferred not to contain promoters.

we also construct three test sets, each having the same transcriptional properties as its corresponding training set. these test sets also contains sequences of length  <dig> bp, constructed in the same way as were the training sets. the promoter-containing test set was constructed from the  <dig> experimentally characterized tsss that were not used to construct the training set. the coding test set consists of the sequences between position + <dig> and + <dig> relative to each of these  <dig> tsss. the con test set consists of  <dig> different  <dig> bp sequences, each centered in the middle of an intergenic region that separates convergently transcribing orfs. these regions were randomly chosen from among those that were not used to make the con training set.

thus we have three types of training sets of equal size, and three types of test sets, also of equal size . each of these three set types has distinct transcriptional attributes. the first contains promoters, the second contains coding sequences but not promoters, and the third contains terminal intergenic sequences that also do not contain promoters. some of the analyses whose results are described below do not involve test sets. in those cases the larger,  <dig> sequence training sets were analyzed. however, in procedures where parameters had to be developed, the training sets were used for that purpose. then the procedure with those parameter values was applied to the test sets.

we know the sidd properties of each sequence in these sets, as these were determined through the whole genome sidd analysis described in the methods section. next, we compare the values of a variety of attributes in promoter-containing regions to their values in each of the two types of non-promoter-containing regions. we describe each in turn.

sidd energy levels are bimodally distributed among promoter sequences
we first examined two sidd properties of the sequences in each of these types of regions. these are the sum Σ of the g values for the  <dig> base pairs in each sequence in the set, and the minimum value gm attained by g in that sequence. the probability distributions of these quantities over each of the three sets are shown in figure  <dig>   the majority of the non-promoter sequences have high values of both Σ and gm, indicating that they remain stable under superhelical stress. however, the distributions of both parameters within promoters are bimodal. it appears that two sub-populations of promoter sequences can be distinguished according to their sidd properties, one group being highly destabilized and the other less so.

because we previously showed that strong sidd sites are closely associated with promoter-containing intergenic regions and avoid coding regions  <cit> , we wanted to test whether this bimodal character could be partially attributed to promoter location. for this purpose we separated the full set of  <dig> experimentally characterized tsss into those that are intergenic and those that occur within orfs. for each we chose the  <dig> base pair segments from positions - <dig> to + <dig> as their promoter-containing regions. we found the Σ and gm values for each of these regions, considering the intraorf-tss and intergenic-tss sets separately. more than 80% of these  <dig> tsss are located in intergenic regions, so these sets have substantially different sizes. for this reason we plot in figure  <dig> the probability distributions of each score for each of these two additional sets. as shown in the figure, there is some enrichment of promoters with intraorf tsss in the non-destabilized population. but because the number of these promoters is small, the bimodal character of the intergenic-tss promoter set is not much different from that of the  <dig> sequence promoter-containing training set that contains both types.

the observed bimodal distribution of sidd properties in promoters may reflect the complexity of transcriptional regulation, suggesting that superhelical destabilization may be needed to initiate transcription from some promoters, but not others. sidd in highly destabilized promoters may be directly involved in the mechanism of open complex formation. however, one cannot rule out the possibility that sidd also could be involved in regulating more stable promoters. in the present analysis we confined our attention to the  <dig> bp sequence from - <dig> bp to + <dig> bp. but sidd sites further upstream are known to play central roles in specific mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. an example is the ihf-mediated transcriptional activation of the promoter governing the expression of the e. coli ilvgmeda operon  <cit> . in the absence of ihf binding, negative superhelicity opens the sidd region, which is located upstream from position - <dig>  ihf binding forces this region back to b-form, so the superhelical stresses open the next most easily destabilized site, which is in the - <dig> region. this regulatory mechanism involves a binding-induced transmission of destabilization from the binding site into the promoter. sidd clearly plays a central role in this mechanism, even though the regulatory sidd site is not at the promoter. a similar mechanism was also observed to regulate the leuv operon, which involved the binding of fis to a sidd site  <cit> .

sidd is more capable than other structural or sequence properties of distinguishing promoters from non-promoter sequences in e. coli k12
other research groups have reported that several other types of structural parameters also appear to be distributed differently between promoters and non-promoters. these include dna intrinsic curvature, protein-induced deformability, and thermodynamic stability  <cit> . to compare these attributes with sidd properties, we used published methods to calculate each property for the entire genome as described in the methods section, then examined their values in the test and training sets.

we determined the sums, and the maximum and minimum values, of each of these quantities over each of the  <dig> bp training sets described above. the distributions of the sums of these parameters in promoters, and in the coding and con non-promoter training sets, are shown in figure 3abc. overall, promoter regions tend to be slightly more curved, less flexible for protein binding, and less stable under thermal fluctuations than are non-promoter regions. however, these feature differences are much less dramatic than those shown in figure  <dig> for sidd properties. the corresponding graphs for the maxima and minima of these parameters are less informative, but show similar trends. 

position-specific score matrices  are frequently used to represent conserved motifs, such as protein binding sites. pssm methods based either on the - <dig> motif or on motifs from both the - <dig> and - <dig> regions have been used to find putative sigma factor binding sites, presumably as signals for promoters  <cit> . by aligning the promoter sequences in the training set at their tsss, we derived a log-odds pssm for the - <dig> motif  in the promoters, using the method described in  <cit> . when this pssm was used to search our promoter and non-promoter test sequences, we found that promoters contain higher densities of high-scoring pssm motifs than do either the coding or the con classes of non-promoters . however, there are substantial numbers of these motifs in all three sets. but the average density of high-scoring pssm motifs is approximately twice as high in promoter-containing sequences as in those that do not contain promoters. so the sum of the motif scores over a window may be a useful discriminator of promoters. but the exact locations of - <dig> motifs alone may not be useful for inferring either transcription start sites or promoter locations.

we have examined the distributions of each of these five properties  for each set of promoter and non-promoter sequences in each of two cases – first using the summed variable and then  its extreme value in the region.  in each case the statistical significances of the differences found between the promoter-containing training set and each of the two non-promoter containing sets were calculated using the kolmogorov-smirnov test  <cit> . the results of these statistical analyses are shown in table  <dig>  for all parameters the distributions of the summed variables show statistically significant differences between promoters and either of the non-promoter sets. among these, the sidd property shows the highest significance level. the distribution of extreme values remains highly significant for sidd, but is much less so for the other parameters. in fact, only the difference of the maximum values of curvature between promoter and non-promoter sets retains significance at the 95% level, while the differences of minimum values of either deformation energy or thermostability between promoters and non-promoters are not significant. thus, among these variables, sidd is the most informative for differentiating promoters from non-promoters, followed by - <dig> motif scores.

sidd alone outperforms other parameters in detecting promoter sequences in e. coli k <dig> and in bacillus subtilis
in order to determine the values of the sidd parameters Σ and gm that most reliably discriminate promoter from non-promoter sequences, we first chose a series of values spanning the ranges of their distributions. each value was regarded as a threshold, so in this analysis a sequence would be classified as containing a promoter or not, solely based on whether or not its sum Σ or minimum value gm fell below this threshold. in this way we placed all the  <dig> bp sequences in the three training sequences in the e. coli genome into promoter or non-promoter bins, then calculated the true and false positive rates achieved when that threshold was used. this was done for each value of Σ or gm in the series, and also for each pair  of values. figure 4a shows the sensitivities and specificities as the threshold of Σ is varied.  similar results are found for gm and also for pairs   as this figure shows, the sensitivity increases monotonically with threshold, while the specificity decreases monotonically. however, the specificity is essentially unity until a substantial threshold, around Σ =  <dig> in this case. in this way a range of threshold values of the parameters Σ and gm were obtained that provide high true positive rates and low false positive rates.

we note that sensitivities of 25% to 30% can be achieved with very small false positive rates, but that higher sensitivities have an increasing cost in terms of decreased specificity. this corresponds to our previous observation that, although strongly destabilized sites are highly concentrated at promoters, not all promoters are destabilized. this fact also is reflected in the bimodal distributions of sidd parameters at promoters that were documented in figure  <dig>  however, at this modest level of sensitivity the specificity is so high that false positives are very few. this will be shown to be an important attribute for promoter prediction, as most other methods suffer from high false positive rates. moreover, for purposes of comparing methods the important attribute is the true positive rate versus the false positive rate, as described below.

we compared the performances on the test sets of these optimized sidd predictors with that of the publicly available nnpp promoter prediction program. although nnpp was originally developed to predict core promoter regions in the drosophila melanogaster genome  <cit> , it was also trained on a set of documented promoter sequences in e. coli k <dig>   nnpp is a neural network-based computer program that uses a time-delay architecture to incorporate structural and compositional properties of promoter sequences. by setting its stringency between  <dig>  and  <dig> , we obtained a range of nnpp predictions regarding whether each sequence in each of our sets either did or did not contain a promoter. the true positive and false positive rates achieved were calculated for each level of stringency. since our sidd method detects promoter-containing regions without pinpointing the tss while nnpp predicts tsss, care must be taken to calculate these rates in equivalent manners. if nnpp predicts that a sequence contains a tss, no matter where it is, for the purposes of comparing with the sidd results that sequence was considered to contain a promoter.

the performance characteristics of the sidd predictor and nnpp were compared using a roc  curve, which graphs the true positive rate vs the false positive rate achieved by each method for several values of sidd parameter thresholds and nnpp stringencies. the results are shown in figure 4b. the better the predictor the more the curve moves towards the vertical axis, having higher true positive rates and lower false positive rates. at a given false positive rate, sidd always predicted more true positives than did nnpp. for example, sidd correctly predicted  <dig> % of the real promoters with a false positive rate of 18%. when nnpp correctly predicted  <dig> % of the real promoters, it had at  <dig> % false positive rate. the area under the roc is a convenient way of comparing classifiers. if the area under the roc curve is unity, the classifier is perfect – it gives a 100% true positive rate with no false positives. conversely, a method with no classifying power will have a diagonal curve with area  <dig>  – it cannot distinguish true from false positives, giving both at the same rates. the sidd predictor curve in figure 4b has area  <dig> , while the nnpp curve has area  <dig> . by this criterion sidd has better predictive power than does nnpp.

the pattern of sidd distribution found in e. coli k <dig>  in which strongly destabilized sites are concentrated at promoters and avoid coding sequences, also occurs in other prokaryotic genomes  <cit> . so we also applied our methods to bacillus subtilis, the only prokaryote from a different phylum than e. coli that has extensive experimental annotation of promoters. we developed training and test sets as described above for e. coli, and examined their sidd properties as above.  in this organism the most extreme level of average destabilization also occurs at position - <dig> relative to the tsss. the sequences at this site are not as conserved as that of - <dig> regions, as was shown in figure 1a to occur in e. coli k <dig>  a bimodal distribution of sidd properties also is found in bacillus subtilis promoter regions, just as it is in e. coli k <dig>   when sidd alone was used to differentiate promoter-containing from non-promoter-containing sequences in b. subtilis, it demonstrated comparable performance to that achieved for e. coli k <dig>  as is shown in figure 4c. despite of the different nucleotide compositions of the genomes of e. coli k <dig> and bacillus subtilis , and the large evolutionary distance separating them, sidd consistently predicted promoter and non-promoter sequences in both organisms with comparably high precisions and low false positive rates.  thus, sidd characteristics may be capable of detecting promoter-containing sequences in many prokaryotic genomes.

a recent paper that used thermostability as a promoter predictor also claimed that their method was likely to be applicable to different microorganisms  <cit> . both our method and theirs have been tested using the same sources of experimental tsss from e. coli k <dig> and bacillus subtilis. since their program was not publicly available, we tried to compare the performances of both methods by plotting our figure 4c in a way equivalent to that of their figure  <dig>  which showed the precision of their method. the definitions of precision and sensitivity used in our figure 4c are the same as those defined there.  as the sensitivity of the thermostability method increased from 20% to 90%, its published precision decreased dramatically – from about 72% to about 37% for e. coli k <dig>  and from about 82% to 27% for b. subtilis. in contrast, the predicted precisions achieved by our sidd-based method at all levels of sensitivity remained higher than 62% for both e. coli k <dig> and b. subtilis. even at sensitivities below 30%, precisions exceeding 90% were achieved for both organisms. these high precisions are achieved because the sidd method has very low false positive rates. so while it may find only a fraction of the actual promoters, those it does identify have high probabilities of being true. as can be seen by comparing figure 4c here with figure  <dig> in the paper describing the thermostability method  <cit> , the sidd technique significantly outperformed that technique. these results further support the claim that sidd is a better discriminator of promoter sequences than is thermostability.

sidd can predict with high confidence the set of promoters that have strong stress-induced destabilization properties
a substantial number of experimentally characterized promoters are required to construct training sequences for most sequence-based promoter prediction programs. sufficiently large documented promoter sets are only available for the e. coli k <dig> and b. subtilis bacterial genomes. one way to circumvent this shortage is to ab initio predict promoters by also identifying the distinct sequence and/or structural attributes with which they are associated. in our previous and current studies we have shown that strongly destabilized sidd regions in the e. coli k <dig> genome are statistically highly significantly associated with promoters  <cit> . since the sidd profile of a genome is directly calculated from its primary sequence, sidd properties can be used to predict promoters, even in cases where training sequences are limited. the following is a demonstration of how sidd properties can be used to estimate the probability that a  <dig> bp fragment in the e. coli k <dig> genome contains a promoter. for this purpose we use the sum sidd parameter Σ, although similar results may be obtained with the minimum value gm. this approach can be applied to any completely sequenced bacterial genome, once its sidd profile has been calculated.

for the purposes of this calculation we consider  <dig> bp segments in the e. coli k <dig> genome, and seek the probabilities that they contain promoters, given their sidd properties. the number nd of dna segments having d <t can be calculated directly from the sidd profile of the genome. the number np of segments that contain promoters is not known, so illustrative calculations can be made using various values for this quantity. then the probabilities p and p can be estimated as the fractions of base pairs in the genome that lie in these two types of regions. these are

where n is the number of base pairs of the genome. also,

p =  <dig> - p.

the e. coli k <dig> genome analyzed here has length n =  <dig> bp and approximately  <dig> annotated genes. assuming each gene has at least one promoter, and that all promoters for a gene lie in one  <dig> bp segment, we estimate the probability p that a randomly chosen  <dig> bp segment contains a promoter to be p =  <dig> , so p =  <dig> .

next we need to find threshold values t that give acceptable values for the probabilities p and p. one wants the probability p to be as large as possible, while keeping p small. as shown in eqns 1a and 1b, these probabilities depend on the estimated number of promoter-containing and non-promoter-containing segments, and on the probabilities p and p. values for the latter probabilities can be found for the case of the summation sidd parameter from the information in figure 4a. there one sees that a threshold sum of t = <dig>  gives a substantial probability p that a promoter satisfies the threshold and a very small probability p that a non-promoter does. using this value one finds from the figure that p =  <dig> . from the sidd profile of the whole genome we find there are  <dig> regions where the sum Σ of the sidd energies is less than  <dig> . thus, from eqn 2a one finds that p = 1356*100/ <dig> =  <dig> . if we assume as above that there are  <dig> promoter-containing regions, one for each gene, then eqn 2b gives p =  <dig> . substituting into eqn 1a, we calculate that a  <dig> bp dna fragment whose sum Σ of sidd energies is less than  <dig>  has probability of being a promoter p =  <dig> * <dig> / <dig>  =  <dig> . similarly, we find in this case that p =  <dig> , so the probability of such a region not being a promoter is p =  <dig> * <dig> / <dig>  =  <dig> .

we also performed similar calculations on the b. subtilis genome, which has length n =  <dig> bp, and approximate  <dig> genes. assuming again that each gene has one promoter-containing region, we find for this genome that p = 4226*100/ <dig> =  <dig> . when we choose the threshold value t =  <dig> , we calculate that p =  <dig> *100/ <dig> =  <dig> . p =  <dig>  and p =  <dig> . using these values in eqns 1a and 1b, we find that the probability of a region being a promoter, given that it satisfies the threshold condition, is p =  <dig> ; and the probability of it being a non-promoter is p =  <dig> .

it is interesting to notice that the thresholds for the sidd summation parameter are almost identical for e. coli k <dig> and b. subtilis. this seems unlikely to be a coincidence since these organisms are in different phyla, and have quite distinct genomic compositions, gene sets and environmental niches.

two points must be borne in mind when interpreting these results, which are intended only to be illustrative. first, the values computed for these probabilities depend on an estimate for the number of promoters in the given genome. because prokaryotic genes are often arranged into co-transcribing operons, it may not be correct that every gene has its own promoter. however, some genes in e. coli are known to have multiple promoters. and second, not all promoters are strongly destabilized. because the sidd method presented here has a small false positive rate, it can reliably find those promoters that are destabilized, but will not find those that are not.

sidd and - <dig> motifs together predict promoter and non-promoter sequences with high accuracy
as was described above, several types of dna structural parameters, as well as - <dig> motif scores, have been suggested to differentiate promoters from non-promoter sequences, at least to some degree. one strategy for improving promoter predictions could be to combine together different variables that may not be highly correlated. we have calculated the correlation coefficient for each pair of these attributes over the entire collection of three training sets. table  <dig> shows the results of this analysis. sidd is moderately positively correlated with deformability and low thermostability, and moderately negatively correlated with - <dig> motif scores. high curvature is seen not to correlate with any other parameters used in this study.

we developed a linear classification function for discriminating promoter from non-promoter sequences in e. coli k <dig> that combines together multiple parameters  <cit> .  when all these variables were combined together, the resulting classifier achieved an accuracy of more than 82% on our test sets. however, a linear discrimination analysis that only included the sidd sum parameter Σ and the - <dig> motif scores performed almost as well, attaining an accuracy of about 80%. similar results were obtained when linear classifiers were developed for b. subtilis.  the small loss of predictive accuracy that results when the other parameters are omitted indicates that, of the parameters examined here, sidd and - <dig> motif scores are the two most effective attributes for differentiating promoters from non-promoters.

sequence-based methods  are known to suffer high false positive rates. the high accuracy achieved by the linear classification functions developed here largely resulted from a dramatic decrease in the false positive rate that occurred when sidd properties were included. similar result were found for a eukaryotic promoter prediction program mcpromoter  <cit> . there a combination of sequence information with several physical properties achieved a 30% reduction of false positives, when compared with the sequence model alone.

annotating promoter regions in microbial genomes using sidd, either alone or combined with sequence motifs
the procedure schematically described in figure  <dig> has been developed to annotate promoter regions in sample microbial genomes. complete genomic sequences of more than  <dig> prokaryotic and archaeal organisms have been downloaded from the ncbi web site, and their sidd profiles have been calculated. these sidd profiles can be accessed through our database at  <cit> . to annotate the promoter regions in a given genome, our program calculates the sum of the sidd energies and the minimum energy over a  <dig> bp window. this window is moved along the genome with an offset of  <dig> bp, and parameter values are calculated for each position. for those genomes that have enough experimentally characterized promoter sequences, we will additionally build pssms for the conserved motifs embedded in these sequences. the sum of the motif scores of the promoter sequences and non-promoter sequences are then calculated using these pssms. these scores, together with their correspondent sidd scores , are used as training sets for the linear classification function kernel to predict new promoter regions in the whole genome. post-processing includes combining overlapping  <dig> bp potential promoter-containing regions into a single site prediction, and identifying potential transcriptional start sites. for those genomes that have insufficient experimental data to generate a meaningful pssm, we will use sidd as a sole predictor for discriminating promoters. although the promoters predicted in this way may represent only a fraction of all the possible promoter regions in the genome, the present results suggest that they have high probabilities of being true.

we tested these approaches using the e. coli k <dig> genome. when sidd scores were combined with - <dig> motif scores,  <dig> out of the  <dig> document tsss were found to occur in the predicted  <dig> potential promoter regions. when sidd was used as a sole predictor and a threshold for Σ of t =  <dig> was used ,  <dig> documented tsss were found in the predicted  <dig> promoter regions. while the number of potential promoter regions was much smaller when sidd was the sole predictor, the fraction of the predicted sites with experimentally documented tsss doubled. using either predictor, several instances were observed where multiple tsss were located in a single predicted region. we expect the identification of these potential regulatory regions could enable further bioinformatics and experimental studies.

CONCLUSIONS
in this report we show that the propensity to undergo stress-induced duplex destabilization  is a distinctive structural attribute of prokaryotic promoter sequences. sidd is not directly related to primary sequence alone, nor equivalent to the thermostability of the dna double helix. comparisons with other important dna structural properties, and with conserved - <dig> motifs, show that sidd is the best discriminator between promoter and non-promoter sequences in test sets derived from the e. coli k <dig> genome.

we have developed methods to identify promoter sequences in prokaryotic genomes that use sidd either as a sole predictor or in combination with other dna structural and sequence properties. the inclusion of sidd properties is shown to greatly reduce the false positive prediction rates of predictions. so, for any given false positive rate, the true positive rate is higher when sidd is included than when it is not. when applied to e. coli k <dig> and to bacillus subtilis, the two experimentally best annotated bacterial genomes, our methods achieved comparably high levels of accuracy for both, and outperformed other published promoter prediction methods.

because these organisms are from different phyla and their genomes have different nucleotide compositions, we suggest that this approach might be useful for other prokaryotes, for which experimental information may not be available. in all the microbial genomes we have investigated to date, strong sidd sites have been found to be preferentially located in those intergenic regions that are known or inferred to contain promoters. the sidd-based methods presented here have been implemented in a preliminary strategy for annotating promoter regions in complete microbial genomes. although these methods cannot predict all the promoter-containing regions in a genome, they do find large sets of potential regions that have high probabilities of being true positives. these lists of predicted promoter-containing sites can be used as targets for experimental verification or further bioinformatic investigation. this approach could be especially valuable for those genomes about which there is limited experimental data.
