BACKGROUND
eukaryotic genome contains a large excess of non-coding sequences. conservation of these sequences among species is a strong indication of their functional significance. with the availability of genome sequences it is possible to identify such sequences taking a comparative genomics approach  <cit> . the clusters of homeotic genes, which are expressed in a coordinated manner  <cit> , are among the most conserved regions of the vertebrate genome. clustering of genes that are regulated in a linked manner has been noticed in several other cases  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanism behind such coordination in regulation is not yet understood. several mechanisms have been proposed that link the organization of homeotic genes and the spatio-temporally controlled expression  <cit> . colinearity in hox complexes was first discovered in drosophila  <cit>  and later studies on the bithorax complex have demonstrated the role of chromatin organization in its regulation  <cit> . recent studies on the hoxd complex suggest a role for higher order chromatin organization in the regulation of this complex involving up to  <dig> kb upstream region  <cit> .

RESULTS
we compared genomic regions flanking hox complexes in order to identify conserved regions with potential regulatory function. here we report that the upstream regions of hoxd complexes of human, mouse, rat, sacred baboon, horn shark, zebra fish and puffer fish contain long stretches of extremely conserved sequences. in the  <dig> kb region upstream of the hoxd complex from these organisms we found an extremely conserved region spread in three blocks located within  <dig> kb from the 3' end of the evx- <dig> gene. these conserved regions, designated as conserved region  <dig>  conserved region  <dig> and conserved region  <dig>   show a degree of conservation not seen before among distant species. detailed analysis of each region spanning to several hundred base pairs, in particular the cr <dig> shows several stretches of  <dig> % conservation, fig.  <dig>  we also noticed longer stretches of conservation among mammals, which gradually shortens as we go towards lower vertebrates, defining the core of each conserved region, across the vertebrate classes, see additional file  <dig>  this and the fact that in case of shark, as compared to mammals, the intervening sequence lengths between cr <dig> and cr <dig>  and cr <dig> and evx- <dig> is shorter by ~ <dig> bp and ~ <dig> bp, respectively  suggest that starting from the shorter conserved regions, additional unique sequences have progressively been acquired and conserved during the evolution of primates from lower vertebrates. this may reflect the molecular basis of conservation and elaboration of hox gene regulation during evolution of these species  <cit> .

universal occurrence of these sequences in all vertebrate classes was confirmed by their amplification using primers from human hoxd complex  followed by southern hybridization and sequencing . furthermore, using cr <dig>  cr <dig> or cr <dig> as query we searched genomic sequences of variety of eukaryotes in available databases. this search indicated that these sequences are single copy and vertebrate specific. while these conserved regions appear to be a key component of the hoxd complex of all vertebrates looked at, we did not find such a degree of conservation in the flanking regions of other hox complexes  of vertebrates. in order to trace back the evolutionary origin of such sequences, it will be of interest to investigate occurrence of these sequences at the corresponding region in the hox complexes of species of urochordata, cephalochordata or even agnatha. in the tunicate oikopleura dioca, where hox genes are dispersed but the spatial pattern seen in other animals is still present  <cit> , we did not find cr <dig>  cr <dig> or cr <dig>  also, we did not find any significant conserved region corresponding to these crs in the amphioxus genomic region that contains the cluster of hox genes. it appears, therefore, that these extremely conserved sequences have originated in the vertebrates where the hox complex has additional distinct features of tight clustering compared to the insect hox clusters and the temporal colinearity, not seen in invertebrates.

several recent reports using comparative genomics approach have identified conserved non-coding regions among different vertebrates  <cit>  but none to the degree that we report here. the mechanism that may require such a high degree of conservation is not known. it is not, therefore, immediately clear what precisely is the role of these sequences. est database search revealed that part of cr <dig> and cr <dig> are transcribed without any significant orf but no est corresponding to cr <dig> or any other part of the  <dig> kb region was found, fig.  <dig>  a possible mechanism could involve rna from this region that may function by base pairing to the genomic target sites. if that is the case, such high conservation could be expected. role of transcription in the regulation of bithorax complex is emerging from recent studies  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
while such an extreme conservation of several hundred nucleotides over half a billion years in a region that does not code for any known proteins certainly implicates essential role for such sequences, probably in the regulation of hoxd complex, no known regulatory element requires such extreme conservation extending up to hundreds of base pairs. it is, therefore, likely that these elements could be components of a novel mechanism common to all vertebrates that regulates this gene complex. we are tempted to suggest that such a strongly conserved region from fish to human linked to a gene complex that is known to determine body axis formation may be the key determinant of molecular basis of early ontogeny. early embryos of all vertebrates show striking similarity and we suggest that these elements may control the early expression pattern of hoxd which leads to similar pattern of the embryo shape. the gradient of conservation seen in this region from fish to human may further signify the evolutionary history of this locus and diversification of the morphological features along the anterior-posterior body axis of the vertebrate classes.
