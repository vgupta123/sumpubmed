BACKGROUND
as one of the most species-rich fern genera, polystichum roth  is almost a cosmopolitan genus naturally distributed on every continent except antarctica. estimates of the number of species in the genus worldwide have ranged from at least  <dig>  <cit> , to slightly more than  <dig>  <cit> , ca.  <dig>  <cit>  to ca.  <dig>  <cit> . our recent explorations in species-rich areas such as southern china and northern and central vietnam have demonstrated that there are actually far more species in the genus than had been thought. besides, the application of molecular phylogenetics in the study of polystichum has revealed a number of cryptic or semi-cryptic species of polystichum previously unknown to science . consequently, in its most recent circumscription , polystichum constitutes likely the third largest fern genus in the world with ca.  <dig> species  <cit> , just smaller than asplenium l.  and elaphoglossum schott ex j. smith . species of polystichum commonly occur in temperate and subtropical regions, in lowlands and montane to alpine areas, and are most diverse in the northern hemisphere, especially in southwestern and southern china, the himalaya , japan , and vietnam . the old world taxa represent ca. 80 % of the species diversity in the genus. a rich diversity of polystichum is also found in the mountains of tropical americas . about  <dig> species of polystichum are distributed in north america and north of mexico  <cit> ,  <dig> in mainland africa  <cit> , eight in madagascar and the mascarene islands  <cit> , three in macronesia  <cit> , four in europe  <cit> ,  <dig> in australasia  <cit>  and a few in new guinea and the pacific islands.

a morphology-based infrageneric classification of a group is basically phylogenetic hypotheses based on morphology. an infrageneric treatment of a genus is important for floristic and monographic studies and this is particularly true for a large genus like polystichum  <cit> . although infrageneric classifications of polystichum go back at least to keyserling  <cit>  who established p. sect. parapolystichum keyserling  ching), the first relatively comprehensive attempt at subdividing the genus in a natural way was conducted by tagawa  <cit> . based on morphological characters such as pinnation, the aspect of scales and sori, tagawa  <cit>  divided the species of korea, japan, and taiwan into eight sections: p. sect. achroloma tagawa, p. sect. crucifilix tagawa, p. sect. cyrtomiopsis tagawa, “p. sect. eupolystichum” diels , p. sect. haplopolystichum, p. sect. mastigopteris tagawa, p. sect. metapolystichum tagawa, and p. sect. sorolepidium  tagawa .table  <dig> infrageneric classifications of polystichum

in the study of the species of polystichum of japan, ryukyu, and taiwan, daigobo  <cit>  recognized tagawa’s  <cit>  eight sections and proposed an additional eight ones mainly based on the morphology of microscales on abaxial leaf surfaces: p. sect. adenolepia daigobo, p. sect. lasiopolystichum daigobo, p. sect. macropolystichum daigobo, p. sect. micropolystichum daigobo, p. sect. prionolepia daigobo, p. sect. scleropolystichum daigobo, p. sect. stenopolystichum daigobo, and p. sect. xiphopolystichum daigobo . notably, p. sect. scleropolystichum is a homotypic synonym of p. sect. hypopeltis with p. aculeatum as its type  <cit> .

fraser-jerkins  <cit>  classified the  <dig> species of the indian subcontinent into seven sections: p. sect. duropolystichum fraser-jenkins, p. sect. hypopeltis  t.moore, p. sect. macropolystichum, p. sect. metapolystichum, p. sect. micropolystichum, p. sect. polystichum, and p. sect. sorolepidium .

in revising the african species of polystichum, roux  <cit>  classified the  <dig> species he recognized into nine sections including p. sect. lasiopolystichum, p. sect. metapolystichum, p. sect. xiphopolystichum, and other six sections  he proposed in his ph.d. dissertation. later when he published his work  <cit>  he did not describe these six sections officially and recognized only  <dig> species and one hybrid for africa. an extensive study of subdividing polystichum was conducted by kung et al.  <cit>  where the then recognized  <dig> species of polystichum in china were accommodated in  <dig> sections. four of tagawa’s  <cit>  eight sections and six of daigobo’s  <cit>   <dig> sections were adopted, albeit often with dramatically different circumscriptions. two additional sections were introduced: p. sect. neopolystichum ching ex li bing zhang & h.s.kung and p. sect. sphaenopolystichum ching ex w.m.zhu & z.r.he .

the most recent and comprehensive subdivision of polystichum was performed by zhang and barrington  <cit>  who arranged the  <dig> species recognized for flora of china in two subgenera: p. subg. polystichum and p. subg. haplopolystichum  li bing zhang, and the former further into  <dig> sections while the latter into nine sections . nine of the  <dig> sections were newly proposed and most of the existing sections were circumscribed differently in comparison with their earlier delimitations by tagawa  <cit> , daigobo  <cit> , fraser-jerkins  <cit>  and kung et al.  <cit> .

in the era of molecular phylogenetics, although substantial progress in understanding the phylogeny of polystichum has been achieved using plastid rbcl, rps4-trns, and trnl-f data , the relationships among sections, species, and previously recognized genera, cyrtogonellum and cyrtomidictyum, as well as cyrtomium subser. balansana, have not yet been resolved and the majority of the asian species not included in any molecular analyses. so far no monophyletic supraspecific taxa except cyrtomidictyum  have been recovered using molecular data. almost all morphological hypotheses about the relationships within polystichum, especially in terms of subdivisions of the genus, have largely remained speculative.

the objectives of this study included:  to test the monophyly of polystichum using the largest taxon and character sampling so far;  to resolve the major relationships within polystichum worldwide with focus on the old world taxa which represent ca. 80 % of the species diversity in the genus;  to evaluate the monophyly of the supraspecific taxa recognized in the most recent classification and to test other previous morphology-based hypotheses of relationships within polystichum.

polystichum is weakly supported  as monophyletic and sister to a clade containing cyrtomium and phanerophlebia . within polystichum, the two subgenera, p. subg. polystichum  and p. subg. haplopolystichum , are strongly supported as monophyletic. within p. subg. haplopolystichum, the  <dig> accessions of the  <dig> species are resolved into seven well-supported clades  and one weakly supported clade . within p. subg. polystichum, the  <dig> accessions of the  <dig> species are resolved into three well-supported clades: clade k , clade l , and the hymaso superclade , and the hymaso superclade further into a number of clades including the mcschmans  clade, the hysufi  clade, the afra clade, the australasian clade, and the north american clade . the hysufi clade is weakly supported as monophyletic and comprises clades v, w, and x1–x <dig>  p. discretum  j.sm., p. retrosopaleaceum  tagawa, and p. weimingii li bing zhang & h.he, while the mcschmans clade is strongly supported as monophyletic  and contains clades m–u, p. bakerianum  diels, and an undescribed species from sichuan, china.

discussion
monophyly of polystichum and its relationships with cyrtomium and phanerophlebia
while the monophyly of polystichoid ferns  has been highly supported in previous studies  <cit> , the relationships among these three genera remain ambiguous. with the largest sampling so far , our study resolved polystichum as monophyletic but only with weak support . although earlier studies  <cit>  using a limited molecular sampling  found polystichum  as paraphyletic in relation to cyrtomium , the monophyly of polystichum is further supported by several morphological features . our result is also consistent with some more recent studies based on multi-locus datasets  <cit> .

the sister relationship between cyrtomium and phanerophlebia is highly supported by our phylogenetic reconstructions . as early as  <dig> yatskievych et al. already found that cyrtomium and phanerophlebia are convergent descendants from different progenitor groups based on chloroplast restriction site data  <cit> . however, a closer relationship of polystichum with cyrtomium than with phanerophlebia was found by li et al.  <cit>  based on plastid trnl-f and rps4-trns data and by mc keown et al.  <cit> . our data do not support this resolution .

generally, the relationships among polystichoid ferns obtained here are in agreement with those found in most of the earlier phylogenetic studies but more studies are needed to fully resolve the relationships among these three genera.

relationships within polystichum
within polystichum,  <dig> accessions are resolved into two monophyletic clades corresponding to p. subg. polystichum and p. subg. haplopolystichum  li bing zhang defined by  <cit> , both with strong support. the sister relationship between these two subgenera agrees with the morphology and the findings with molecular data by driscoll and barrington  <cit>  and li et al.  <cit> , but contrasts those by little and barrington  <cit>  and lu et al.  <cit>  based on rbcl data alone which resolved p. subg. polystichum as sister to cyrtomium, and them together as sister to p. subg. haplopolystichum . the bulbil-bearing species are resolved in five clades , suggesting that bulbils evolved at least five times in polystichum, twice in p. subg. polystichum and three times in p. subg. haplopolystichum.i polystichum subg. haplopolystichum  li bing zhang : nine sections are recognized by zhang and barrington  <cit>  in this subgenus. the monophyly of all but two sections is recovered and six sections are well supported as monophyletic. the relationships among all but four sections in the subgenus are well resolved.polystichum sect. mastigopteris tagawa . – morphologically, this section is characterized by having entire indusia  <cit>  and it contains only two species following zhang and barrington  <cit> , a delimitation different from that of kung et al.  <cit>  who included p. erosum ching & shing in this section as well. two accessions representing only the type of the section, p. craspedosorum  diels, were included in our study. our results show that this section is strongly  supported as sister to a clade containing p. sect. basigemmifera and p. sect. platylepia, and these three sections together are sister to the rest of the subgenus. our study also shows that p. sect. mastigopteris sensu kung et al.  <cit>  is paraphyletic in relation to portion of p. sect. basigemmifera and p. sect. platylepia .

polystichum sect. platylepia li bing zhang . – this section, characterized by having ovate to broadly lanceolate rachis scales and once-pinnate lamina  <cit> , contains 3– <dig> species occurring in southwest to central china. three accessions representing three species of this section were included in our study. our data resolved this section as monophyletic  and sister to p. sect. basigemmifera. this resolution is not in conflict with what we found earlier based on plastid trnl-f data alone  <cit> , which placed p. sect. platylepia , p. sect. basigemmifera, and p. sect. mastigopteris in an unresolved trichotomy.

polystichum sect. basigemmifera  li bing zhang . – this section has been accommodated in p. sect. micropolystichum by kung et al.  <cit>  as p. ser. basigemmifera w.m.chu & z.r.he based on the small size of plants and pinna morphology of the members. however, the type of p. sect. micropolystichum, the tetraploid sexual p. thomsonii  bedd., and its relatives lack bulbils on the rachis and are members of p. subg. polystichum , while members of p. sect. basigemmifera have bulbils on the rachis and are members of p. subg. haplopolystichum. this section contains about five species, four of which are endemic to southwest to central china  <cit> . we included three species in this study including the sexual tetraploid p. erosum ching & k.s.shing. our data confirmed the monophyly of this section , consistent with our earlier findings based on more species and accessions sampled  <cit> . our data resolved this section as sister to p. sect. platylepia .

polystichum sect. cyrtomiopsis tagawa . – this section contains about four species and is characterized by prolonged rachis apex with bulbils and broad-type microscales  <cit> . this section was often recognized as a genus, i.e., cyrtomidictyum ching . our data resolved it as part of p. subg. haplopolystichum, a result consistent with those in earlier studies  <cit> . our study further resolved this section as monophyletic  and sister  to a clade containing p. sect. adenolepia, p. sect. crucifilix, p. sect. cyrtogonellum, p. sect. haplopolystichum, and p. sect. sphaenopolystichum . this resolution is consistent with that found by driscoll and barrington  and that by lu et al. , but inconsistent with that found by li et al.  <cit>  who resolved p. sect. cyrtomiopsis  as sister to the rest of p. subg. haplopolystichum  based on plastid trnl-f and rps4-trns data. occasionally, veinlets in species of this section can be anastomosing.

polystichum sect. adenolepia daigobo . – this section in its new circumscription  <cit>  contains about six species including four assigned to cyrtomium in early classifications . we sampled four species in our study. our analyses recovered the monophyly of the section but only with weak support in ml and mp analyses  but moderately support in bi analysis . interestingly, the two former members of cyrtomium, which have anastomosing venation , are paraphyletic in relation to two species with free venation, suggesting that the anastomosing venation in the section evolved at least twice or evolved once but reversed to free venation from anastomosing venation in the p. falcatilobum + p. formosanum clade. polystichum sect. adenolepia sensu daigobo  <cit> , which included p. obliquum  t.moore, a member of p. sect. haplopolystichum, is apparently polyphyletic.

polystichum sect. crucifilix tagawa . – this section contains only four species, three of which were included in our study. our data confirmed the monophyly of this section  and resolved it as sister to p. sect. adenolepia, but this resolution is only weakly supported . the japanese endemic p. yaeyamense  makino is surprisingly resolved as a member of p. sect. crucifilix. a close examination of herbarium material of p. yaeyamense shows that some individuals of this species have and some do not have bipinnate lamina base, similar to p. normale ching ex p. s. wang & li bing zhang  <cit> , another member of this section  <cit> .

polystichum sect. cyrtogonellum  li bing zhang . – this section was often treated as a genus  but was recently considered as a section of polystichum by zhang and barrington  <cit> . liu et al.  <cit>  recovered the monophyly of this section with high mlbs support . our earlier trnl-f data alone resolved this section as paraphyletic in relation to p. subg. haplopolystichum  <cit> . our current study recovered the monophyly of the section but with low statistical support in ml and bi analyses . monophyly of p. sect. cyrtogonellum is supported by morphology: species of this section have one row of sori on each side of midrib, pinnae symmetrical or nearly symmetrical at the base except p. minimum  li bing zhang. one species  diels) and one hybrid  included in this section have anastomosing venation  <cit> . this, together with anastomosing venation in p. sect. adenolepia  and sometimes in p. sect. cyrtomiopsis, reinforces that anastomosing venation in polystichum evolved multiple times independently.

polystichum sect. sphaenopolystichum ching ex w.m.chu & z.r.he . – this section is the only one in the subgenus with pinnae finely dissected  <cit>  and contains about  <dig> species. lu et al.  <cit>  recovered the monophyly of the section  but only two species were sampled. liu et al.  <cit>  sampled three species and recovered the monophyly of p. sect. sphaenopolystichum but without any statistical support. our data of eight accessions representing ca. eight species failed to recover the monophyly of the section in all three analyses; instead the eight accessions were resolved into three subclades: the p. alcicorne subclade containing ca. three species, the p. tonkinense subclade containing one species, and the p. auriculum subclade containing p. auriculum ching, p. bifidum ching, p. caruifolium  diels, and p. christii ching . in bi analysis, the p. alcicorne subclade is resolved as sister to p. sect. cyrtogonellum with bipp =  <dig> . p. sect. sphaenopolystichum together with p. sect. cyrtogonellum is strongly supported as monophyletic . one member of the section, p. wattii  c.chr., has never been included in any molecular studies and might not belong to this section.

polystichum sect. haplopolystichum tagawa . – in its recent circumscription , p. sect. haplopolystichum, is different from its original delimitation by tagawa  <cit> . the latter contained also p. sect. adenolepia, p. sect. hecatoptera, and p. sect. stenopolystichum in our definition  <cit> . our results show that p. sect. haplopolystichum sensu tagawa  <cit>  is highly polyphyletic and taxa included in its original definition are resolved in two subgenera . this section in our definition  <cit>  is estimated to contain about  <dig> species  <cit>  and almost all species recently described from southern china and vietnam belong to this section . we included seven accessions representing four species. an ongoing project focusing on this section will include many more species. our current study shows that this section is strongly supported as monophyletic  and is resolved as sister  to a clade containing p. sect. cyrtogonellum and p. sect. sphaenopolystichum.



ii polystichum subg. polystichum: all accessions of this subgenus are resolved into three major clades: clade k , clade l , and the hymaso superclade . the hymaso superclade represents ca. 30 % of the species diversity in the genus and is morphologically diverse. it contains  <dig> of the  <dig> sections recognized by zhang and barrington  <cit>  for the genus in china. within the hymaso superclade, the relationships are poorly resolved. nevertheless, we recovered two major clades: the hysufi clade  and the mcschmans clade . the former contains species of p. sect. hypopeltis, p. sect. fimbriata, and p. sect. subfimbriata, while the latter contains species of nine sections recognized by zhang and barrington  <cit> . the bulbil-bearing species in the subgenus only appear in the mcschmans clade. <dig> polystichum sect. xiphopolystichum daigobo . – polystichum sect. xiphopolystichum is defined as a combination of p. sect. xiphopolystichum sensu kung et al.  <cit>  and p. sect. duropolystichum fraser-jenk.  <cit> . fifteen out of ca.  <dig> species of the section were sampled in our study . this clade, strongly supported as monophyletic , is resolved as sister to the rest of the subgenus with high support values . p. sect. xiphopolystichum is also characterized by several morphological features such as the lamina stiff, leathery or nearly leathery, often shiny adaxially; the pinnae dentate and with hard spinules at apex and often also on margin; and the rachis scales linear and brown to blackish  <cit> . our resolution is consistent with that found by driscoll and barrington  <cit>  who sampled five species only. within the section , p. sect. xiphopolystichum sensu kung et al.  <cit>  strongly supported as monophyletic , while p. sect. scleropolystichum  sensu kung et al.  <cit>  is paraphyletic in relation to p. sect. xiphopolystichum sensu kung et al.  <cit> . morphologically, p. sect. duropolystichum could well be monophyletic based on its open spines on the pinna margins and thicker leaves  <cit> . more molecular data might recover the monophyly of p. sect. duropolystichum.

 <dig> polystichum sect. polystichum . – ten accessions representing nine species of this section are resolved as the second earliest divergent lineage in the subgenus , which is consistent with the findings by driscoll and barrington  <cit>  who first discovered this clade. species of this section occur in the circumboreal regions  roth, a diploid sexual species) and the new world tropics  <cit> . mchenry and barrington  <cit>  further discovered that the exindusiate andean polystichum was sister to the mexican polystichum clade and they together were sister to the mexican p. speciosissimum  r.m.tryon & a.f.tryon. morphologically, this section is characterized by having lamina papery or leathery, 1-pinnate to bipinnate; pinna or pinnule spinulose or not spinulose on the margins; and sori indusiate or exindusiate  <cit> . the currently defined p. sect. polystichum sensu driscoll and barrington  <cit>  and zhang and barrington  <cit>  might need further division based on the results of mchenry and barrington  <cit> .

polystichum sect. polystichum sensu fraser-jenkins  <cit>  also included the tetraploid sexual p. acutidens christ and four diploid sexuals p. atkinsonii bedd., p. nepalense  c.chr., p. obliquum  t.moore, and p. stenophyllum christ. our study, together with previous studies , shows that p. sect. polystichum sensu fraser-jenkins  <cit>  is apparently polyphyletic as these members are resolved in three independent clades .

 <dig> polystichum sect. achroloma tagawa . – when tagawa  <cit>  established this section, he included only the type p. nepalense  c.chr. . daigobo  <cit>  added p. falcatipinnum hayata  nakaike, tetraploid sexual) to this section. this delimitation was accepted by zhang and barrington  <cit>  but rejected by kung et al.  <cit>  who included the two species in p. sect. polystichum. fraser-jenkins  <cit>  placed the latter species in p. sect. hypopeltis. our study is the first to sample both of the species in a molecular analysis. two species formed a clade with strong support  in our analysis. this section is resolved as sister to the p. sect. macropolystichum clade , consistent with the resolution found by driscoll and barrington  <cit> . these two sections share evergreen leaves which are shiny adaxially.

 <dig> polystichum sect. macropolystichum daigobo . – as defined by zhang and barrington  <cit> , this section contains species with or without proliferous bulbils but all members are of relatively large habit and laminae that are dark green and shiny adaxially. ten accessions representing about  <dig> out of ca.  <dig> species of this section are sampled in our study . our analyses recovered the monophyly of p. sect. macropolystichum sensu zhang and barrington  <cit>  with strong support . polystichum sect. macropolystichum sensu daigobo  <cit>  which includes p. kiusiuense tagawa  is apparently polyphyletic. the type of p. sect. prionolepis daigobo, the tetraploid sexual p. biaristatum  t.moore, is resolved as a member of p. sect. macropolystichum sensu zhang and barrington  <cit>  suggesting that p. sect. prionolepis is a heterotypic synonym of p. sect. macropolystichum. the same species was treated as a member of p. sect. neopolystichum by zhang and kung  <cit> , but this is not supported by our data. p. mucronifolium, resolved as a member of p. sect. macropolystichum in our study, was placed in p. sect. metapolystichum tagawa, a heterotypic synonym of p. sect. hypopeltis  <cit> , by fraser-jenkins  <cit> .

 <dig> polystichum sect. chingiarum li bing zhang . – this monospecific section contains p. chingiae ching  <cit>  and our study is the first to include it in a molecular analysis. our study resolved the species in the mcschmans clade, but its relationships are not well resolved. the isolated phylogenetic position is consistent with its special morphology. morphologically, this species has lamina 1-pinnate, pinnae not cartilaginous at margins, and sori in  <dig> or  <dig> rows on each side of midrib and abaxial on veinlets  <cit> . such a combination of morphological features is unique within the genus.

 <dig> polystichum sect. micropolystichum tagawa . – this section contains only about six montane to alpine species  <cit> . we included three accessions representing two species. our study resolved p. sect. micropolystichum as a strongly supported clade  which is sister to p. grandifrons, but the sister relationship between those lineages is weakly supported statistically  and morphologically  <cit> .

fraser-jenkins  <cit>  also placed the diploid sexual polystichum capillipes  diels and p. wattii  c.chr. in p. sect. micropolystichum. neither of the species were sampled in our current study, but our earlier study  <cit>  resolved the former species in p. sect. basigemmifera .

 <dig> polystichum sect. neopolystichum ching ex li bing zhang & h.s.kung . – when zhang and kung  <cit>  described this section, seven species were included. zhang and barrington  <cit>  excluded p. biaristatum  t.moore, p. mucronifolium  c.presl, and p. parvifoliolatum w.m.chu from the section sensu zhang and kung  <cit>  but recognition of this section was tentative pending more evidence. we included three accessions representing two species in this study: p. grandifrons and p. longispinosum ching ex li bing zhang & h.s.kung. our data failed to recover the monophyly of the section although both species are resolved as members of the mcschmans clade . fraser-jenkins  <cit>  placed p. grandifrons c.chr. in p. sect. macropolystichum, which is not supported by our data. given our limited phylogenetic sampling and the low support values, the taxonomic rearrangements in p. sect. neopolystichum need further investigations.

 <dig> polystichum sect. sorolepidium  tagawa . – sorolepidium christ was often recognized as a genus . liu et al.  <cit>  found it being nested within polystichum based on rbcl data. zhang and barrington  <cit>  recognized it as a section of polystichum and redefined it as being comparable to p. ser. moupinensia h.s.kung & li bing zhang, only a part of p. sect. lasiopolystichum sensu kung and zhang  <cit> . eight accessions representing ca. seven species are included in our study. the section is resolved as paraphyletic in relation to p. nudisorum ching  and p. sect. stenopolystichum . our data suggest that it might be necessary to recognize p. sect. sorolepidium sensu stricto  c.chr. and p. glaciale christ; fig. 1b: clade r1; mlbs: 100 %; mpjk: 100 %; bipp:  <dig> ) and p. sect. lasiopolystichum daigobo .

polystichum sect. sorolepidium sensu fraser-jenkins  <cit>  also included the diploid sexual p. bakerianum  diels and the tetraploid sexual p. wilsonii christ which were included in p. sect. hypopeltis sensu zhang and barrington  <cit> . our study clearly placed p. wilsonii as a member of clade x <dig> and the phylogenetic position of p. bakerianum is not resolved .

 <dig> polystichum sect. hecatoptera  li bing zhang . – this monospecific section contains p. hecatopterum diels only  <cit> , a diploid sexual  <cit> , and our study is the first to include this species in a molecular analysis. we could not amplify its rbcl gene. our data from other four plastid loci show that this species is definitely a member of p. subg. polystichum confirming our earlier hypothesis  <cit> , in spite of its striking morphological similarities with members of p. subg. haplopolystichum in once-pinnate lamina without bulbils on its rachis  <cit> . xiang  <cit>  established p. ser. hecatoptera l.l.xiang based on its long-spinulose pinna margins but placed it in p. sect. haplopolystichum, as tagawa  <cit>  did. interestingly, daigobo  <cit>  placed this species in p. sect. stenophyllum, which is a section of p. subg. polystichum  although he did not recognize any subgenera in the genus. our ml and bi analyses resolved p. hecatopterum as sister to a clade containing p. sect. stenopolystichum and part of p. sect. sorolepidium  with weak support.

 <dig> polystichum sect. stenopolystichum daigobo . – tagawa  <cit>  placed the type of the section, p. stenophyllum christ, a diploid sexual species, in p. sect. haplopolystichum based on its once-pinnate lamina and terminal sori on veinlets. four accessions representing ca. three species of this section are included in our study. all species of this section have proliferous bulbils at the apex of lamina  <cit> . our study is the first to confirm the monophyly of the section. this section is resolved as monophyletic  and sister to p. sect. lasiopolystichum sensu daigobo  <cit>  with high support values . this sister relationship is unexpected given the huge differences between the two sections. polystichum sect. lasiopolystichum was merged with p. sect. sorolepidium by zhang and barrington  <cit> .

 <dig> polystichum sect. crinigera li bing zhang . – this monospecific section contains p. crinigerum  ching only  <cit>  and our study is the first to include it in a molecular analysis. p. crinigerum, together with p. nepalense and p. chingiae ching, was included in p. sect. polystichum by kung et al.  <cit> . our study shows that p. crinigerum is not closely related to either of them suggesting that the similarity among them in once-pinnate lamina and asymmetrical pinna base is not a synapomorphy. however, the relationships of p. crinigerum are not well resolved with our data. our ml and mp analyses resolved it as sister  to a species of p. sect. hypopeltis and they together are sister  to p. longispinosum ching ex li bing zhang & h.s.kung, a species assigned to p. sect. neopolystichum  <cit> . our bi analysis resolved it as sister to p. longispinosum .

 <dig> polystichum sect. fimbriata li bing zhang . – this monospecific section contains p. fimbriatum christ  <cit>  and our study is the first to include it in a molecular analysis. polystichum fimbriatum is strongly  supported as sister to a clade containing portions of p. sect. hypopeltis  in our sampling . this sister relationship is unexpected given their dissimilarity in morphology of lamina shape and scales  <cit> . this resolution collapsed in bi analysis which resolved it as part of a trichotomy.

 <dig> polystichum sect. subfimbriata li bing zhang . – this monospecific section contains p. subfimbriatum w.m.chu & z.r.he  <cit>  and our study is the first to include it in a molecular analysis. when p. subfimbriatum was described, chu and he  <cit>  compared it with p. fimbriatum. indeed, both species share once-pinnate and leathery lamina, but their scales on rachis and stipes are very different. a close relationship between these two species is not suggested with our analyses which resolved p. subfimbriatum as sister to portion of p. sect. hypopeltis  but with low statistical support.

 <dig> polystichum sect. hypolepis  t.moore . – zhang and barrington  <cit>  re-defined this section and made it the most accommodating section in the genus. they noted that this section in their definition is possibly polyphyletic. we included  <dig> accessions in our study. our results show that p. sect. hypolepis is indeed polyphyletic. accessions of this section are resolved in about nine subclades, which partially corresponds to the morphological heterogeneity noticed in this section. although polyphyletic, the majority of species belonging to p. sect. hypolepis are included in the hysufi clade which also contains p. fimbriatum and p. subfimbriatum. within this clade, three relatively well-supported subclades can be identified: the p. ovatopaleaceum subclade , the p. polyblepharum subclade , and the p. sinensis subclade . the p. polyblepharum subclade is strongly supported as monophyletic  and contains species from japan , taiwan  and eastern china  c.presl). the p. ovatopaleaceum subclade is also supported as monophyletic  and contains species from east china  sa. kurata), japan , and the mascarenes  c.chr.). the p. sinensis subclade  contains species from africa, china , hawaii, japan, and the mascarenes. species of the p. sinensis subclade is also characterized by their lanceolate rachis scales.

uncertainties still remain regarding the phylogenetic positions of several species previously assigned to p. sect. hypopeltis, i.e., p. bakerianum  diels, p. braunii  fée, p. discretum  j.sm., p. microchlamys  kodama, p. retrosopaleaceum  tagawa, p. setiferum  moore ex woynar , p. weimingii li bing zhang & h.he, members of the australasian clade  <cit> , and members of the afra clade  <cit> . but these issues do not affect our overall topology. the monophyly of p. sect. achroloma, p. sect. macropolystichum, p. sect. polystichum, p. sect. sorolepidium, p. sect. stenopolystichum, and p. sect. xiphopolystichum is strongly supported by our analyses .

notably, the isolated positions of these species is in line with their peculiar morphology. polystichum discretum  and p. weimingii were placed in p. ser. linearia h.s.kung & li bing zhang based on their linear stipe scales by zhang and kung  <cit>  and zhang and barrington  <cit> , and our current study resolved them as sister to each other with strong support , confirming their close relationships with each other hypothesized by zhang and he  <cit> . polystichum bakerianum  and p. microchlamys  do not seem to have close relatives judging from their morphologies. a close relative of p. braunii , p. ningshenense ching & y.p.hsu, as hypothesized by zhang and kung  <cit> , is not sampled in our current study. zhang and kung  <cit>  established p. ser. brauniana h.s.kung & li bing zhang to accommodate p. braunii, p. ningshenense, and some species in our subclades x <dig> and x <dig> . our current study did not recover the monophyly of p. ser. brauniana.

 <dig> the afra, the north american, and the australasian lineages . – in our topology, several african species are grouped together in a clade with moderate support . this group was previously circumscribed and named the afra clade by driscoll and barrington  <cit> . unfortunately, our data do not well resolve the relationships of this lineage within polystichum. indeed, in the ml topology, the afra clade is grouped together with a clade containing only species restricted to australasia but this sister relationship is not supported by our analyses . the australasian group  previously identified by perrie et al.  <cit>  and li et al.  <cit>  is not supported by our expanded dataset. four accessions representing three species from north america constitute a well-supported group, consistent with the allozymic evidence by soltis et al.  <cit>  who found close relationships between two species of this clade . american and african clades may deserve a taxonomic recognition as sections of p. subg. polystichum. however, our limited taxonomic sampling clearly needs to be expanded and the relationships better resolved to unambiguously assess the monophyly and determine their relationships within the phylogeny of polystichum.





CONCLUSIONS
our study based on the largest character sampling and most taxonomically comprehensive sampling so far successfully resolved the  <dig> accessions representing ca.  <dig> species of polystichum into two well-supported major clades, corresponding to the two subgenera, p. subg. polystichum and p. subg. haplopolystichum. although our study is still preliminary of many results, given that the taxon and character sampling still needs improvements and that some results are poorly supported, our current work is the first toward a new classification based on morphological and molecular evidence in the genus polystichum. of the  <dig> sections of polystichum recognized in a recent classification of the genus, except three monospecific sections which are each represented by one accession, four sections  are resolved as paraphyletic or polyphyletic,  <dig> are recovered as monophyletic. of the  <dig> monophyletic sections, two  are weakly supported and  <dig> are strongly supported. in addition, our study also recovered the monophyly of the afra clade  and the north american clade . the relationships of  <dig> sections  are well resolved . however, several phylogenetic uncertainties remain, particularly in p. sect hypopeltis. these issues probably linked to introgression and/or fast radiation highlight the fact that more data including nuclear data are needed to obtain a complete picture of the evolutionary relationships in polystichoid ferns and therefore draw a new taxonomic framework for one of the largest genera of ferns, polystichum.
