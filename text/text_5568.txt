BACKGROUND
the sox  gene family represents a family of transcriptional factors characterized by the presence of a homologous sequence called the hmg  box. the hmg box is a dna binding domain that is highly conserved throughout eukaryotic species. so far, twenty sox genes have been identified in humans and mice and they can be divided into  <dig> subgroups on the basis of sequence similarity and genomic organization  <cit> . sox genes bind to the minor groove in dna to control diverse developmental processes  <cit> .

sox <dig>  one of the key members of the sox family gene, is highly expressed in embryonic stem cells  <cit> . recently, takahashi et al. showed that sox <dig> is a key transcription factor, in conjunction with klf <dig>  oct <dig> and c-myc, whose over expression can induce pluripotency in both mice and human somatic cells  <cit> . sox <dig> is one of the four factors  that yu et al. used to reprogram human somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells that exhibit the essential characteristics of embryonic stem  cells  <cit> . sox <dig> is one of the two factors  that were sufficient to generate induced pluripotent stem cells from human cord blood cells  <cit> . due to its importance in conferring stemness of cells, the target genes for sox <dig> in mouse embryonic stem cells were defined using chip-seq technology  <cit> .

sox <dig> has also been implicated in several cancers including gastric cancer  <cit> , breast cancer  <cit> , pancreatic cancer  <cit> , pulmonary non-small cell and neuroendocrine carcinomas  <cit> . in addition, sox <dig> was identified to be a prognostic marker for human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma  <cit>  and rectal cancer  <cit> . schmitz et al. found that sox <dig> is over expressed in malignant glioma while displaying minimal expression in normal tissues  <cit> . more recently, gangemi et al. showed that silencing of the sox <dig> in freshly derived glioblastoma tumor-initiating cells  stopped proliferation and the resulting cells lost tumorigenicity in immunodeficient mice  <cit> . ikushima et al. showed that inhibition of tgf-beta signaling drastically deprived tumorigenicity of glioma-initiating cells  by promoting their differentiation, and that these effects were attenuated in gics transduced with sox <dig> or sox <dig>  <cit> . taking together, these data suggested that sox <dig> is also a key gene in maintaining the stemness of glioma stem cells.

given that sox <dig> is predominantly expressed in embryonic and adult stems cells, including neural progenitor cells, and re-activates in cancers, including malignant gliomas, we hypothesized that the re-activation program of sox <dig> may play an important role in the carcinogenesis and maintenance of gbm. although the sox <dig> response program in mouse stem cells was previously defined  <cit> , the re-activation program in cancers such as gbm has not yet been defined. using chip-seq technology, we conducted a genome-wide target identification for sox <dig> binding in gbm cells. we generated mrna expression profiles using the applied biosystems' microarray platform and microrna expression profiles using next-generation sequencing after knockdown of sox <dig> expression in gbm cells. an integrated analysis of these data reveals key response programs that potentially play important roles in gbm.

RESULTS
sox <dig> affects colony formation and cell proliferation in gbm
we previously completed massively parallel signature sequencing  and identified sox <dig> as significantly over expressed in gbm tissues compared to normal brain tissues  <cit> . we identified two mpss tags that correspond to different polyadenylated isoform, and both are up-regulated in gbm tissues compared to normal brain tissues  <cit> . our data is consistent with the observation that sox <dig> is widely expressed in gliomas including glioblastomas but not in normal brains except for in ependymal layers  <cit> .

to assess the functional consequences of sox <dig>  we knocked down the sox <dig> gene by sirnas in the gbm cell line ln <dig> using sox <dig> sirnas . as shown in figure 1a, we were able to knockdown sox <dig> almost completely using either of the pre-designed sox <dig> sirnas  from ambion inc. .

knockdown of the sox <dig> gene in ln <dig> cells significantly reduced the numbers of colonies formed as shown in figure 1b. in three replicate experiments, the colony numbers for the mock-knockdown cells were  <dig>   while that for the sox <dig> knockdown were  <dig>   . furthermore, knockdown of sox <dig> in ln <dig> cells reduced the numbers of cells, reaching statistical significance at day four  and further at day six  by mtt assays .

global identification of sox <dig> binding sites in gbm cells by chip-seq analysis
in order to understand the genome-wide binding patterns of sox <dig>  we applied chip-seq technology, which is a novel approach for identifying transcription factor binding sites genome-wide  <cit> . we performed replicate sox <dig> chip and igg chip. after sequencing analysis, we obtained a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig>  sequence tags respectively for sox <dig> and igg that can be mapped uniquely to the human genome allowing two mismatches.

using the sissrs  chip-seq analysis program  <cit> , we identified a total of  <dig>  sox <dig> binding regions with a p value <  <dig>  using igg control chip-seq data as the negative control . we randomly picked  <dig> genes for which the promoter regions are enriched for the sox <dig> ip, and we were able to confirm all  <dig> genes to be enriched in the sox <dig> ip dnas compared to the igg-ip dnas using real time quantitative pcr , suggesting that the false positive rate is negligible in our dataset.

there are  <dig> sox <dig> binding regions that can be mapped to tss  of  <dig> known genes. we calculated the distance of the sox <dig> binding regions to tss  and then tabulated the frequency across the distance intervals before tss and after tss. figure 2b shows that the peak of the sox <dig> binding regions is around the tss sites. we found that about 13% sox <dig>  binding regions are mapped within  <dig> kb of tss , and about 25%  are mapped >  <dig> kb 5' distal to the tss. the rest mapped to >  <dig> kb downstream of tss start sites of genes.

to understand the function of the sox <dig> binding genes, we performed a go analysis using the go miner program using evidence level  <dig> of molecular functions. the enriched go terms are shown in table  <dig>  the top enriched go terms include go: <dig> gtpase activator activity, go: <dig> voltage-gated cation channel activity, go: <dig> glutamate receptor activity, go: <dig> sh <dig> sh <dig> adaptor activity, go: <dig> transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase activity . it should be pointed that expression of  <dig> of  <dig> genes with signal transducer activity, ,  <dig> of  <dig> receptor genes  , and  <dig> of  <dig> kinase genes   was altered in response to sox <dig> knockdown.

marson et al. and chen et al. recently used chip-seq to map binding sites of sox <dig> and other key tfs in the mouse es cells  <cit> . morsen et al. identified  <dig>  sox <dig> binding sites corresponding to  <dig>  genes based on the criteria that a binding site is within  <dig> kb of the tss or tes . chen et al. identified  <dig>  sox <dig> binding regions  that could be assigned to  <dig>  genes of the gene using the same criteria. the union of the two lists generated  <dig>  genes. interestingly, the overlapped genes between the two lists is  <dig> genes  . the difference could be due to the use of different antibodies, chen et al. used the sox <dig> antibody  while morson et al. used an affinity purified goat polyclonal antibody , or differences in the analysis pipeline and down stream analysis procedures  <cit> .

using the homologene table for human and mouse from ncbi , we compared the sox <dig> targets that we identified in ln <dig> cells with the sox <dig> targets that were identified in mouse es cells  <cit> . we were able to identify  <dig> human homologues of  <dig> mouse sox <dig> binding genes from chen et al's paper, and then were able to identify  <dig> unique genes   that are common to the sox <dig> binding gene in the human gbm cells . these suggest that there are common sets of genes regulated by sox <dig> in humans and mice, and in es cells and in cancer cells. however, we identified many sox <dig> binding sites that are only present in the glioblastoma cell line, suggesting that sox <dig> targets different pathways in the context of cancer cells.

boyer et al. applied chip-chip technology to identify oct <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog target genes in human embryonic stem cells using a human promoter array  <cit> . they identified  <dig>  of the sox <dig> binding promoter regions for known protein-coding genes in human es cells. in ln <dig> cells, we found  <dig> unique genes that overlapped with their data . analysis with the fisher's exact test  revealed that the overlap is highly significant . this suggests that while there is some conservation of the genes regulated by sox <dig> in es cells and gbm cells, there are also differences in sox <dig> binding regions between the cells. the difference could be due to several factors. first, there are differences in technologies used. the array designed by boyer et al. covered the - <dig> kb to + <dig> kb region relative to each transcription start site of  <dig>  transcription start sites representing  <dig>  unique genes. if a sox <dig> binding region is outside of the region covered by the printed oligos, or is not on the array, it would be missed by chip-chip analysis. however, the chip-seq technology is not limited by the probes selected to be printed on a chip, and therefore could identify sox binding regions further upstream or down stream of genes. second, the sox <dig> response program could be different in different cells . it is possible that different sox proteins interact selectively with and regulate a unique repertoire of target genes, and the selectivity is dependent on the type of cell in which the protein is expressed.

to see whether they were unique functional classification or over representation for the sox <dig> targets in gbm cells versus those in human es cells, we compared  <dig> unique sox <dig> targets in gbm cells with  <dig> unique sox <dig> targets in human es cells using gsea to identify unique over represented go terms in each set of targets. we found that the unique sox <dig> targets in gbm cells were enriched for ion transport, receptor activities, neuron differentiation neurogenesis, etc. , while the unique sox <dig> targets in human es cells are enriched for macromolecular complex, ion homeostasis, apoptotic program, atpase activity, etc. .

we were interested to see whether the genes related to stemness and/or differentiation are sox <dig> targets in gbm cells. using the molecular signature database  at the broad institute, we found that go term go: <dig>  consists of a compiled set of  <dig> genes related to differentiation. in addition, ben-porath et al. curated a gene set with  <dig> genes over expressed in human embryonic stem cells according to  <dig> or more out of  <dig> profiling studies in the table s <dig> of their published paper  <cit> . we found that  <dig> of  <dig> genes related to regulation of cell differentiation were sox <dig> targets in gbm cells including acin <dig> , bmpr1b , ets <dig> , shh , igfbp <dig>  and runx <dig>  . in addition,  <dig> of  <dig> es enriched genes were sox <dig> targets in gbm cells including cdc <dig> , chek <dig> , fgf <dig> , rfc <dig>  and utf <dig>  . however, we did not find oct <dig> and nanog to be sox <dig> targets in gbm cells.

identification of the dna binding consensus and other known tf binding sites in the sox <dig> bound regions
to see whether the human sox <dig> binding regions in gbm cells have their own unique and enriched binding motif, we used the motifsampler program  to identify binding consensus sequences enriched in the sox <dig> binding regions that we identified. we found a consensus sequence wwtgnwtw with a very high log-likelihood score of  <dig> . the output matrix for this consensus sequence is shown in additional file  <dig>  and there are  <dig> instances of this motif in  <dig> sox <dig> binding regions . the consensus logo is shown in figure 2d.

we were curious whether known tfs could bind to the sox <dig> binding regions that we identified and act as sox <dig> cooperators for the regulation of gene expression. in order to systematically search for potential bindings of other transcription factors, we used the motifscanner program  and scanned all tf motif matrices  using the human transcription factor subset of the transfac professional  <dig> . matched matrices with likelihood  ratios of  <dig> or higher were tabulated and frequencies calculated . among the top known tf matrices  that were identified as co-occurred more than 10% of the time with sox <dig> in the sox2-binding region are: the oct family, the fox family, the hnf family, the gata family and several other tf irf <dig> , pou1f <dig> , tef <dig> , areb <dig>  and gr .

pou1f <dig> is the pou class  <dig> homeobox  <dig>  oct family tfs also contain pou domains. these suggest that sox <dig> and many pou domain proteins may act together to control gene expression. sox <dig> and oct family tfs such as oct <dig>  and oct3/ <dig>  are well known to work synergistically in embryonic stem cells  <cit> . additionally, we identified novel transcriptional factors in the sox <dig> bound regions, including fox  and hnf  family proteins. however, its significance remains to be determined. interestingly, hnf <dig>  also contains a pou-homeodomain, while hnf <dig> alpha, which is also named foxa <dig>  contains a fork head domain  <cit> .

microarray analysis reveals that sox <dig> knockdown reduces the expression of other sox family members but up-regulates bex <dig> and bex2
we performed microarray analysis comparing sox <dig> knockdown and mock transfected ln <dig> cells, and we identified a total of  <dig> probes  that were changed >  <dig> fold between sox <dig> knockdown and sox2-mock transfected ln <dig> cells . array analysis confirmed that sox <dig> expression was indeed decreased after sox <dig> knockdown. additionally, we confirmed the array data by rt-pcr analysis of  <dig> randomly selected up-regulated genes after sox <dig> knockdown  .

gene ontology analysis of all go categories revealed that proteins belonging to these cellular locations go: <dig> extracellular region and go: <dig> golgi lumen are enriched, and that proteins involved in the go: <dig> regulation of cytokine biosynthetic process . indeed, we found that knockdown of sox <dig> increased the expression of several cytokines including il <dig> and il <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig> and il <dig> , and the expression of two interleukin receptors-interleukin  <dig> receptor and interleukin  <dig> receptor-like  <dig>  we also found many interesting families of proteins that were regulated by sox <dig> by visual inspection of the gene list. for example, we noticed that two other sox family protein, sox <dig> and sox <dig>  also exhibited reduced expression by more than  <dig> fold after sox <dig> knockdown . we also found that many members of the protocadherins including protocadherin  <dig>   <dig>  beta  <dig>  and gamma a <dig> and c <dig> were reduced after sox <dig> knockdown. however, the expression of protocadherin alpha  <dig> was increased after sox <dig> knockdown . protocadherin are a large family of cadherin-related molecules that are highly expressed in the brain and their expression appears to be developmentally regulated  <cit> .

the expression of many interesting gene families were up regulated after sox <dig> knockdown. for example, we found that brain expressed genes basp <dig> , bex <dig>  and bex <dig>  were up regulated after sox <dig> knockdown . we also found that knocking down sox <dig> also increase the expression of many solute carrier family proteins including slc2a <dig>  slc3a <dig>  slc7a <dig>  slc14a <dig>  slc22a <dig> and slc30a <dig>  these solute carrier proteins transport many important solutes such as urea, glucose, organic cations, dibasic and neutral amino acids, zinc, and cationic amino acids .

the gene regulated by sox <dig> could be directly regulated or indirectly regulated. by integrating the array data with the chip-seq data, the directly targeted genes of sox <dig> can be inferred. we found  <dig> sox2-regulated genes whose promoters were bound by  <dig> sox <dig> binding regions . interesting genes include bcl <dig>  and bcl <dig> interacting protein  <dig> , four brain and neuron expressed genes basp <dig> , nedd <dig> , nrg <dig>  and negr <dig> , two interleukins il <dig> and il <dig>  two protocadherins pcdh <dig> and pcdh <dig>  runx <dig> , and three solute carrier proteins slc3a <dig>  slc7a <dig> and slc30a <dig> . the venn diagram also showed that  <dig> genes were common sox <dig> targets for gbm and es cells and changed in expression after sox <dig> knockdown . they include ebf <dig> , basp <dig> , slc30a <dig> , member 1), and slc3a <dig> . we speculate that these genes may be involved in gbm stem cells. however, further experimentations are necessary to understand the role of these genes in glioma stem cells.

sox <dig> and mir <dig> form a double-negative feedback loop in gbm cells
we also analyzed the effect of sox <dig> on mirnas using next generation sequencing . microrna sequencing is an efficient way to identify known and novel micrornas that are differentially expressed  <cit> . after mirna sequencing and data analysis, we found  <dig> precursor micrornas  that were changed >  <dig> fold between sox <dig> knockdown and sox2-mock transfected ln <dig> cells . six micrornas including mir- <dig>  - <dig>  -145*, -143*, -253-5p and mir- <dig>  were up regulated after sox <dig> knockdown and the rest were down regulated when sox <dig> was knocked down. we picked  <dig> mirnas to confirm the next generation data using rt-pcr. we confirmed that mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were up regulated after sox <dig> knockdown and that mir-146a, - <dig>  -20b and mir-9- <dig> were down regulated after sox <dig> knockdown .

xu et al. showed that mir- <dig> targets sox <dig> and down regulates its expression in human embryonic stem cells  <cit> . to see whether the same is true in gbm cells, we transfected ln <dig> gbm cell with mir- <dig> mimics and we found that mir- <dig> also decreased sox <dig> expression in gbm cells . as knocking down sox <dig> up regulates mir <dig> in the rt-pcr and next-generation sequencing data , this suggests that sox <dig> itself down regulates mir- <dig>  taken together, sox <dig> down regulates mir- <dig> and mir <dig> also down regulates sox <dig>  suggesting that sox <dig> and mir <dig> form a double-negative feedback loop in gbm cells. we also checked to see whether there are sox <dig> binding regions in the proximity of mir <dig> genomic locus. we found that there are no sox <dig> binding regions with significant p values  in the close proximity of the mir <dig> locus. the closest one is about  <dig> kb from the mir <dig> genomic locus. this may suggest that the sox <dig> feedback regulation of mir <dig> is indirect, not resulting from direct binding of the sox <dig> to the mir <dig> genomic region.

discussion
we applied chip-seq technology to identify global sox <dig> binding regions in gbm cells. to our best knowledge, this is the first global analysis of sox2's binding regions in cancer cells. sox <dig> encodes a member of the sry-related hmg-box  family of transcription factors. we investigated sox2's global binding targets by chip-seq analysis, and found that sox <dig> binding regions in gbm cells are enriched for at nucleotides with a consensus sequence wwtgnwtw . the mouse sox <dig> consensus motif in the mouse es cells found by chen et al. has the sequence 5'-cattgtt-3'  <cit> . the similarity lies in that both consensus sequences are at rich sequences with a core tg di-nucleotide flanked by at rich sequences. the difference may due to the fact that they derived from different types of cells  and species .

the at rich sequence we identified for sox <dig> consensus is consistent with previous in vitro studies showing that the hmg domain of sox proteins binds to the minor groove of dna through at rich sequences with a heptamer motif wwcaaag   <cit> . therefore we have identified at rich sox <dig> specific binding sequences. before the development of chip-chip or chip-seq technologies, mertin et al. determined the dna-binding properties of sox <dig> using random oligonucleotide selection assay  <cit>  and they identified a core sequence of an at rich sequence aacaat or wwcaaw  for sox <dig> binding. the hmg domain in sox family proteins forms an l-shaped module composed of three helices that binds to dna in the minor groove. sox proteins are categorized into groups a-g based on their sequence homology  <cit> . sox <dig> belongs to group a  and sox <dig> belongs to group e  <cit> . the amino acid sequence identity of the hmg domain within the same group is high at >90%, however, the amino acid sequence identity between distant groups decreases to ~60%  <cit> . a sequence alignment revealed that sox <dig> and sox <dig> only have about 61% amino acid sequence identity in the hmg domain. the sequence variations may explain the similar at rich properties yet different consensus in their binding regions for sox <dig> and sox <dig>  additional functional binding assays including mutagenesis and footprinting analysis will be needed to confirm the binding activities and specificities. further experimentation is therefore warranted.

it was a surprise to find that about one quarter of genes regulated by sox <dig> encompass important go categories:  <dig> out of  <dig> genes  were found to have signal transducer activity ,  <dig> of  <dig> belong to transmembrane receptor genes  , and  <dig> of  <dig> are kinase genes  . signal transducer, receptor and kinase genes are important genes that play an essential role in cellular functions and therefore it is not surprising that sox <dig> is an essential gene that plays important roles in development and in carcinogenesis.

we found that bex <dig>  and bex <dig>  were up regulated after sox <dig> knockdown . we have previously shown that bex <dig> and bex <dig> are silenced in gbm tumor specimens and exhibited extensive promoter hypermethylation  <cit> . we demonstrated by in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model that bex <dig> or bex <dig> possess tumor suppressor activity  <cit> . our data suggested that sox <dig> might down regulate bex <dig> and bex <dig> expression, reducing their tumor suppressor activities and thus promoting carcinogenesis. however, we did not find sox <dig> binding regions in the bex <dig> and bex <dig> gene loci, suggesting the down regulation was properly an indirect effect of sox <dig> knockdown.

we found that sox <dig> also regulates the expression of sox family protein sox <dig> and sox <dig> . sox <dig> plays roles in neural determination and differentiation  <cit>  and is a neural stem cell marker  <cit> . bylund et al. showed that sox <dig>  sox <dig> and sox <dig> are the transcription factors that keep neural cells undifferentiated by counteracting the activity of proneural proteins  <cit> . however, the role of sox <dig> in gbm has not yet been studied. sox <dig> plays important roles in blood vasculature formation  <cit> . young et al. assessed the effects of disrupted sox <dig> function on mcf- <dig> human breast cancer and human umbilical vein endothelial cell  proliferation by measuring brdu incorporation and by mtt assay, cell migration using boyden chamber assay, and capillary tube formation in vitro  <cit> . they showed that over expression of wild-type sox <dig> promoted capillary tube formation of huvecs in vitro, whereas expression of dominant-negative sox <dig> impaired tube formation of huvecs  <cit> . therefore, sox <dig> is a potential target for antiangiogenic therapy of human cancers. the role of sox <dig> in gbm has not been studied. taking together, sox <dig> could act through sox <dig> and sox <dig>  and thus play roles in both maintaining stem cell properties of glioma cells and forming tumor vasculature in gliomas, which are two major obstacles preventing us from treating these tumors effectively.

by microrna sequencing we determined that levels of  <dig> precursor micrornas  are altered in response to sox <dig> knockdown . we showed that sox <dig> could down regulate the expression of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> was shown to be down regulated in several cancers such as colon cancers  <cit>  and prostate cancers  <cit> , and mir- <dig> was shown to be down regulated in colon cancers  <cit>  and bladder cancers  <cit> . the relationship of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> and gbm has not been studied and is worth future investigation.

we further demonstrated that sox <dig> and mir- <dig> form a double-negative regulation loop in gbm cells . double-negative feedback loop involving micrornas and their targets have been observed previously  <cit> . a double-negative feedback mechanism has been proposed as a mechanism to form bistability in cellular states. johnston et al. demonstrated that the stability and irreversibility of the terminal differentiated state of neuronal cells is ensured by a double-negative feedback loop between two micrornas lsy- <dig> and mir- <dig> and their transcription factor targets in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . a positive-feedback loop or double-negative feedback loops can convert graded inputs into switch-like, irreversible responses  <cit> . such a system will be "bistable" as the system exists almost exclusively in one of two possible states. bistability has been shown in several signal transduction and transcriptional regulatory events such as the p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-jun amino-terminal kinase pathways in xenopus oocytes  <cit> . for a bistable system with two components a and b, the system will toggle between two stable states: one with a on and b off and one with b on and a off. for example, for the sox <dig> and mir- <dig> bistable system, the system can be on sox <dig> on, mir- <dig> off state or sox <dig> off, mir- <dig> on state . further experimentation will be necessary to analyze in detail the two cellular states for the sox2-mir <dig> double-negative feedback loop in gbm cells.

CONCLUSIONS
we have comprehensively characterized the sox <dig> response program by integrated analysis using several advanced technologies including chip-seq, microarrays and microrna sequencing. the datasets of chip-seq, microarrays and microrna sequencing of sox <dig> response program, which, to our best knowledge, are the first datasets of sox <dig> in cancers, will be useful resources for the research community. furthermore, the insights we gained from our integrated analysis further our understanding of the roles of sox <dig> in carcinogenesis.
