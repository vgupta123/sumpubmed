BACKGROUND
transforming growth factor beta  is a multi-functional cytokine that regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and survival. it plays a critical role in development, wound healing and immune responses through its regulatory effects on many cell types including epithelial and hematopoietic cells  <cit> . three isoforms , which are encoded by different genes and share high homology, have been identified in mammals. tgf-β <dig> is the predominant isoform expressed in immune cells, but all three isoforms have similar properties in vitro. however, in vivo, they have both redundant and distinctive functions because of spatial and temporal expression during development  <cit> . tgfβ signals are transmitted via a cell surface receptor complex consisting of the tgfβ type i receptor  and tgfβ type ii receptor . to initiate signal transduction, tgfβ binds to tβrii, which in turn recruits tβri, leading to the formation of a tetrameric receptor complex. the constitutively active serine/threonine kinase of tβrii phosphorylates tβri, which activates smad <dig> and smad <dig> via phosphorylation. activated smad2/ <dig> binds smad <dig>  subsequently, the smad2/3/ <dig> complex translocates to nucleus to regulate gene expression  <cit> . besides the smad-dependent pathways, tgfβ also activates the erk  <cit> , pi3k  <cit> , p <dig> and jnk  <cit>  pathways, each of which results in a unique pattern of gene expression and thus physiological function.

the importance of tgfβ signaling in the immune system is highlighted by the finding that mice lacking tgfβ <dig> develop a severe lethal wasting syndrome within 3 weeks of birth, associated with a mixed inflammatory cell infiltration and lesions in different organs including the heart and lungs  <cit> . since tβrii is the primary receptor for tgfβ, leveen et al.  <cit>  generated a conditional ablation model for tgfβ signaling using tβriifx/fx x mx1-cre mice. upon deletion of the tβrii in the bone marrow of adult mice, a lethal inflammatory disorder that is similar to the phenotype of the tgfβ1-null mutants was observed. such lethal disorder was transferable through bone marrow transplantation, indicating that a deficiency of tgfβ signaling in cells of bone marrow origin is sufficient to cause a lethal inflammatory disease  <cit> . further studies on tgfβ1-null mutants or mice with bone marrow-specific deletion of tβrii showed, that tgfβ signaling is critical for t-cell immunity  <cit> , whereas possible functional defects of macrophages lacking tgfβ signaling were largely overlooked.

macrophages are important immune cells that have diverse biological functions, which are, to a large extent, determined by their activation states. exposure to lps and ifnγ induces macrophages to undergo classical activation and differentiate into m <dig> macrophages. m <dig> macrophages are characterized by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines  and the induction of inos , which is essential for generating reactive oxygen species such as no  <cit> . because of their pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic activities, m <dig> macrophages play a critical role in elimination of pathogens and initiation of inflammation. in contrast, when macrophages are exposed to il- <dig> , they undergo alternative activation and polarize into m <dig> macrophages, which are anti-inflammatory. m <dig> macrophages produce anti-inflammatory cytokines  and have increased expression of arginase- <dig>  which competes with inos for a common limiting substrate l-arginine  <cit> . m <dig> macrophages are primarily involved in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, resolution of inflammation, tissue repair, and wound healing  <cit> .

although tgfβ plays a critical role in t-cell immunity, surprisingly, few studies have evaluated the effect of tgfβ signaling on macrophages. to begin to answer this question, we generated mice lacking tβrii and thus tgfβ signaling in hematopoietic cells using tβriifx/fx and vav1-cre mice. vav1-cre has been shown to direct cre-mediated recombination in cells of the hematopoietic lineage  <cit> . interestingly, our studies reveal that macrophages lacking tβrii have defects in expression of a set of genes that form the hallmark of the m <dig> polarizing program, suggesting that tgfβ signaling is needed for the alternative activation of macrophages.

RESULTS
mice lacking tβrii in hematopoietic cells develop a lethal inflammatory and autoimmune syndrome
vav <dig> is a hematopoietic-specific activator for rac gtpases, and the vav <dig> promoter has been widely used to direct expression of genes selectively in the hematopoietic lineage  <cit> . thus, in vav1-cre x tβriifx/fx mice, the vav1-cre transgene only ablates tβrii in hematopoietic cells. we found that mice lacking tβrii function in such cell types were ~50% lighter than wild type  littermates  and usually died at the age of 24-28 days. these tβrii-/- mice showed classical hallmarks of acute lung inflammation. total cell numbers in the balf of tβrii-/- mice were significantly higher than those of wt mice . whereas balf cell populations of age-matched wt mice consisted, as expected, almost entirely of alveolar macrophages, those of tβrii-/- mice instead contained many neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes .

mice lacking tβrii in hematopoietic cells exhibited a normal-sized thymus but enlarged lymph nodes and spleen , which correlated with a greatly increased cellularity of these tissues . tβrii-/- spleens contained increased total neutrophil and t-cell numbers, while total monocyte and b-cell numbers were comparable between genotypes . strikingly, monocyte numbers in bone marrow, and macrophage infiltration in liver were significantly increased in tβrii-/- mice . since macrophage infiltration in liver is a sign of autoimmune disease, the increased infiltration of macrophages in the livers of tβrii-/- mice is consistent with the observed inflammatory autoimmune syndrome. we next examined spleen, lymph nodes and thymus for the major t-cell subsets using facs. analysis of the thymus showed wt and tβrii-/- mice had a similar distribution of cd4+, cd8+ and double positive  or double negative  subsets . this indicates there were no abnormalities in t-cell development, which is consistent with a previous report that tgfβ signaling is not required for thymocyte differentiation  <cit> . we also found that cd <dig> expression on cd4+ t cells was comparable in thymus, spleen and lymph nodes of wt and tβrii-/- mice , suggesting tβrii signaling does not regulate the development of treg cells and consistent with previous studies  <cit> .

analysis of the spleen and lymph nodes showed similar percentages of cd4+ and cd8+ t-cells, although their absolute numbers were increased in tβrii-/- mice . interestingly, however, there was a dramatic increase in expression of cd <dig> on t-cells. around 20% of splenic cd4+ t-cells and 40% of cd8+ t-cells expressed cd <dig> in wt mice, while 90-95% of t-cells lacking tβrii had cd <dig> expression. this was also found in lymph nodes . in addition, a significantly higher percentage of cd4+ t-cells in lymph nodes of tβrii-/- mice expressed cd <dig> . since cd <dig> and cd <dig> are t cell activation markers, our data indicate that one physiological role of tβrii signaling is to suppress t cell activation.

expression of m <dig> markers on bmdms is impaired in the absence of tβrii signaling
the lack of normal alveolar macrophages in the balf of tβrii-/- mice could be associated with intrinsic defects in those macrophages, or could be caused by the environment, since it is well-known that monocytes from the blood can differentiate into different types of macrophages depending upon environmental factors. treatment with lps and ifnγ will generate classically activated m <dig> macrophages, whereas treatment with il- <dig> and dexamethasone generates m2a and m2c polarized macrophages, respectively. to examine macrophages lacking tβrii without the presence of other, possibly confounding, cell types, we isolated bone marrow-derived macrophage/monocytes  from the tβrii-/- mice.

facs analysis of wt and tβrii-/- bmdms after 11 days in culture with m-csf, a macrophage growth factor, showed that cells of both genotypes were uniformly ly6glowcd11bhi and expressed f4/ <dig>  a pan-macrophage surface marker , indicating that the purity of the isolated bmdms is very high . we then treated these bmdms with stimuli that are typically used to generate different subsets of polarized macrophages. additional file 1: figure s2b illustrates that, as reported previously  <cit> , these stimuli generate morphologically distinct populations. however, bmdms with or without tβrii were morphologically similar. we also investigated the efficiency of vav1-cre-mediated ablation of the tgfβrii in these cells. quantitative real-time pcr on dna from bmdms showed that, although the deletion was efficient, there was a residual signal of about 6% for tβrii present in vav1-cre xtβriifx/fx bmdms .

we next assayed wt and tβrii-/- bmdm for their ability to phagocytose apoptotic cells. as shown in additional file 1: figure s2c, there were no significant differences in the ability of m <dig> bmdms with or without tβrii to perform efferocytosis. next, we polarized them using different agents including lps/ifnγ , il- <dig>  and htgfβ <dig>  bmdms polarized towards the m <dig> phenotype had significantly decreased ability to phagocytose dying cells , but no significant differences were observed between wt and tβrii-/- bmdms. we also tested migration. in contrast to bone-marrow derived neutrophils, which showed significant migration towards  <dig>  ng/ml tgfβ <dig>  bone marrow-derived macrophages did not migrate towards 5 ng/ml tgfβ <dig> .

a classical readout for macrophage polarization states is the induction of either inos  or arginase- <dig> , two enzymes that compete for the common substrate l-arginine. as illustrated in figure 2a, inos was not expressed in m <dig> or m <dig> macrophages. lack of tβrii allowed the normal production of inos upon stimulation with lps/ifnγ. as reported previously  <cit> , there was a baseline level of arginase- <dig>  expression in non-polarized macrophages, which was enhanced by treatment with lps. remarkably, tβrii-/- bmdms had very low baseline levels of arg- <dig>  showed severely impaired induction of arg- <dig> by lps and had profoundly reduced induction of arg- <dig> by il- <dig> treatment. similar defects in arg- <dig> expression were obtained when m1-polarized  tβrii-/- macrophages were subsequently treated with il- <dig> to re-polarize them to an m <dig> phenotype. interestingly, macrophages lacking smad <dig> had normal induction of arg- <dig>  indicating that the mechanism is smad3-independent .

tgfβ <dig> is generally regarded as an anti-inflammatory cytokine and it is frequently listed in the same category as il- <dig> and glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone to generate m2c-polarized macrophages. however, we found that wt bmdms reacted to htgfβ <dig> stimulation with an increased expression of arg- <dig> , similar to the classical m2a stimulus il- <dig>  whereas dexamethasone  failed to induce arg <dig> .

to examine if tβrii signaling only regulates arg- <dig> expression, or that there are defects in the expression of other m <dig> markers, we next performed real-time rt-pcr for a number of molecules that are typically up-regulated in il-4-polarized macrophages such as ym1mrc <dig> and mgl1/ <dig> <cit> . as shown in figure 2b, lack of tβrii was associated with decreased basal and il-4-induced transcription of arg <dig> and correlated with decreased transcription of mcr <dig>  mgl <dig>  and ym <dig>  which are also induced by il- <dig>  the transcription of mgl <dig> was not affected. a similar pattern of reduced basal levels of m <dig> markers was also observed in naïve peritoneal macrophages . collectively, our data indicate that tβrii signaling is critical for the optimal expression of genes characteristic for m <dig> polarization.

lack of tβrii signaling is correlated with decreased galectin- <dig>  β-catenin and phospho-akt levels
the molecular pathways that underlie macrophage polarization are of intense interest due to the importance of this cell type in a wide array of pathologies, ranging from autoimmune disorders to cancer, and the desire to be able to modulate their polarization state. however, there are very few reports of null mutants in which macrophage polarization defects have been reported. one of these is galectin- <dig> . macrophages lacking galectin- <dig> show impaired il-4-stimulated m <dig> polarization and lgals <dig> null mutants have reduced tgfβ-associated liver fibrosis  <cit> .

we therefore performed real-time rt-pcr for lgals <dig>  interestingly, tβrii-/- bmdms stimulated with il- <dig> had reduced mrna levels of lgals <dig> . to examine this in more detail, we stimulated wt and tβrii-/- bmdms with different polarizing agents and measured cell surface galectin- <dig> expression using facs. whereas the expression of cell surface cd11b was comparable in these different treatment conditions , bmdms lacking tβrii showed clearly decreased galectin- <dig> expression, especially when exposed to lps/ifnγ .

the e-cadherin/β-catenin complex was recently shown to be a selective marker for alternatively activated macrophages  <cit> . interestingly, when wt and tβrii-/- bmdms were stimulated by il- <dig>  β-catenin levels were ~35% lower in tβrii-/- than in wt bmdms , further indicating that tβrii signaling promotes m <dig> macrophage polarization.

to explore the mechanism by which tgfβ contributes to il-4-induced m <dig> polarization, we examined the downstream targets of il- <dig>  stat <dig> phophorylation is a key signaling event downstream of the il- <dig> receptor complex, and akt also becomes activated in this pathway  <cit> . thus we investigated if stat <dig> and/or akt are also involved in the il- <dig> stimulated polarization that is co-regulated by tgfβ signaling. as shown in figure 3d, p-stat <dig> levels were comparable in wt and tβrii-/- bmdms stimulated with il- <dig>  however, p-akt was decreased ~50% in the absence of tgfβ signaling . this indicates that tgfβ contributes to il-4-induced m <dig> polarization through co-signaling to akt, which is one of the tgfβ <dig> non-smad-associated signal transduction pathways reported in other cell types  <cit> .

discussion
in the current study, we found that the phenotype of mice born without tβrii function in hematopoietic cells overlaps with that of mice born without systemic tgfβ <dig> production. in both cases, the null mutants develop a severe wasting syndrome at around the same time, at 3 weeks of age  <cit> . however, our mice exhibited splenomegaly and lymph node enlargement with a corresponding large increase in cellularity, whereas shull et al. reported reduced size of spleen and peyer’s patches  <cit> .

we measured dramatically increased expression  of the activation marker cd <dig>  a receptor for the extracellular matrix  protein hyaluronic acid, on both cd4+ and cd8+ t cells in the spleen and lymph nodes. similarly increased cd <dig> expression was also observed in mice transplanted with bone marrow of mice transgenic for a dominant negative tβrii construct  <cit> . cd <dig> is a c-type lectin that is expressed on the surface of all leukocytes during activation, and engagement of cd <dig> maintains high expression of membrane-bound tgfβ <dig> on t-cells  <cit> . we found that the numbers of cd4+ and cd8+ t-cells in the lymph nodes that expressed cd <dig> were around twice that of control cells. this result is consistent with the increased numbers of cd69+ t-cells found in the lymph nodes of mice transplanted with bone marrow from tβriifx/fx x mx1-cre mice and with the signs of t-cell activation in lymph nodes and spleen in those mice  <cit> .

alveolar macrophages are a specialized subclass of differentiated tissue macrophages that are generally regarded as regulatory and anti-inflammatory  <cit> . at three weeks of age, vav1-cre x tβriifx/fx mice developed spontaneous pulmonary inflammation in which few normal alveolar macrophages were found. the lack of normal alveolar macrophages could be explained by the pro-inflammatory environment in the lung, which would polarize peripheral blood monocytes that migrate into the lung to an m <dig> phenotype and/or by re-polarization of alveolar macrophages into proinflammatory m <dig> macrophages. also, reduced production of monocytes in the bone marrow could result in lower levels of alveolar macrophages. however, we did not find increased levels of ifnγ, a classic proinflammatory cytokine, in the peripheral blood of the null mutant mice  and there was no evidence for impaired generation of monocytes in the bone marrow of mice lacking hematopoietic tβrii.

to examine possible macrophage-intrinsic defects, we studied naïve, bone-marrow derived monocyte/macrophages for possible cell-intrinsic defects. this analysis showed an overall decreased ability of macrophages lacking tβrii signaling to produce the normal amounts of arg <dig> mrna and protein, either at basal levels or, more markedly, when bmdms were polarized towards an m <dig> phenotype with il- <dig>  in agreement with the regulation of arg- <dig> by tgfβ <dig>  we found increased expression of arg- <dig> in wt macrophages stimulated with this cytokine. moreover, transcription of other m <dig> markers including mgl <dig>  ym <dig> and mcr <dig>  but not mgl <dig>  was also deceased in tβrii-/- bmdms, showing that signals through tβrii modulate the m <dig> transcription program.

ym <dig> is a secretory lectin that promotes th <dig> cytokine expression  <cit> , whereas mrc <dig> is a c-type receptor for mannose that promotes remodeling of the ecm and the uptake and degradation of collagen  <cit> . both mgl <dig>  and mgl <dig> as markers for alternatively activated macrophages are type c galactose-binding lectins with a different binding specificities to carbohydrate structures  <cit> . these results show that tgfβ signaling is responsible for the transcriptional upregulation of several m2-polarization genes in macrophages that are important for binding to carbohydrate structures present in the ecm and on other cells and are consistent with the role of tgfβ as a master regulator of ecm reorganization  <cit> .

we also found that macrophages lacking tβrii produce less mrna for lgals <dig>  which encodes a β-galactoside-binding lectin, and have markedly reduced galectin- <dig> cell surface expression on m <dig>  macrophages. interestingly, galectin- <dig> negatively regulates lps-induced inflammation  <cit> . moreover, bmdms lacking lgals <dig> have reduced arg- <dig> production and are defective in m <dig> polarization  <cit> . these results suggest that some of the defects in tβrii-/- bmdms could be caused by the reduced galectin- <dig> in those cells. importantly, akt phosphorylation was decreased in the il-4-polarized m <dig> tβrii-/- bmdms. this suggests that tgfβ and il- <dig> co-signal to maximally activate the akt pathway. although further experiments will be needed to determine the detailed molecular mechanisms through which tgfβ regulates m <dig> polarization, our findings suggest that modulation of the tgfβ signaling pathway may be a method to medically regulate macrophage polarization.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our results establish a critical biological role for tgfβ signaling in promoting the alternative activation of macrophages. moreover, our results suggest a distinct contribution of monocytes/macrophages to the systemic inflammation observed in mice with defective tβrii function, because lack of tβrii signaling in macrophages inhibits the polarization of macrophages to an anti-inflammatory m <dig> phenotype, this could lead to defective down-regulatory interactions with other immune cells such as t-cells in the lung. these findings further advance our knowledge of the physiological role of tgfβ signaling and enhance our understanding of the regulation of macrophage activation states.
