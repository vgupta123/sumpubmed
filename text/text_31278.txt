BACKGROUND
eukaryotic rna polymerases evolved from a single ancestral enzyme into three structurally related rna polymerase enzymes  with specialized functions in eukaryotes. rna polymerase ii generates all protein-coding mrnas as well as a large number of non-coding micrornas , small nuclear rnas  and small nucleolar rnas . the enzyme is composed of  <dig> subunits , five of which are shared among the three eukaryotic polymerase complexes. the largest subunit, called rpb <dig>  is unique to rna polymerase ii and is involved in its catalytic activity.

the c-terminal domain  of rpb <dig> is essential for the proper regulation of rna polymerase ii  <cit> . the ctd consists of a largely unstructured, repetitive stretch of tandem heptad amino acid repeats with a consensus sequence of tyrosine-serine-proline-threonine-serine-proline-serine . the ctd is connected to the core polymerase enzyme via a flexible linker close to the rna exit site  <cit>  and contains a protein-protein interaction surface for cofactors involved in the regulation of transcription initiation, elongation and rna processing—highly specialized functions that determine the speed and reliability of the polymerase enzyme traversing a gene during transcription  <cit> .

in mammals, the ctd heptad repeats undergo a sequence of characteristic posttranslational modifications during transcription  <cit>  and these modifications determine which cofactors can bind  <cit> . phosphorylation of the s <dig> residue occurs when the polymerase binds to gene promoters, and transcription is initiated  <cit> . the phospho-s <dig> modification is a hallmark of elongating polymerase complexes and is maintained until transcription termination occurs  <cit> . phosphorylation of s <dig> residues in linker-proximal heptad repeats is important for the transcription of snrnas and facilitates the interaction of the rna polymerase ii complex with the integrator complex at these genes  <cit> . methylation of a single arginine residue plays a role in the production of snornas as well as snrnas and serves as a binding site for the tudor domain–containing protein tdrd <dig>  <cit> . phosphorylation of t <dig> residues was shown to play a novel function in 3′-end processing of histone pre-mrnas  <cit> . phosphorylation of y <dig> was coupled to antitermination of transcription  <cit> , and was recently associated with promoters, enhancers, and degradation of rna polymerase ii  <cit> . however, in spite of our increasing knowledge of these marks, the full number and identity of repeats that undergo modification during transcription are unknown.

the ctd repeat motif and tandem repeat orientation are observed in most eukaryotic model organisms, and this configuration evolved early in the history of eukaryotes  <cit> . however, there is considerable diversity in the number and sequence of the repeats across eukaryotic clades, and the complexity of the ctd is roughly correlated with developmental complexity in animal, plant, and fungal multicellular lineages  <cit> . it has been proposed that this diversity in ctd sequences reflects functional constraint due to lineage-specific ctd–protein interactions  <cit> . in mammals, non-consensus repeats are required for the stability of the ctd  <cit> . however, deletion of most of the non-consensus repeats does not affect the housekeeping functions of mammalian cells, but it does impair activator-induced gene transcription  <cit> .

a novel ctd modification of non-consensus repeats necessary for the proper regulation of polymerase pausing was recently discovered  <cit> . lysine residues at the seventh position  in non-consensus distal rpb <dig> ctd repeats are acetylated  in mouse and human, but not in yeast , where the repeats lack lysines. this modification, performed by the acetyltransferase  enzyme p300/kat3b, which is absent in yeast, distinctly marks promoter-proximally paused polymerases. disruption of this mechanism interfered with the expression of two growth-factor-induced genes regulated by polymerase pausing, but did not influence expression or polymerase occupancy at two non-paused genes  <cit> .

knowledge of the evolutionary origins of a gene or pathway can inform analysis of its functions  <cit> . thus, we undertook an evolutionary and functional analysis of the rpb <dig> ctd sequence and the genes influenced by acrpb <dig>  we found that the presence of multiple k <dig> residues, and thus the potential for rpb <dig> ctd acetylation, arose with animal multicellularity during an expansion in the overall number of ctd repeats in metazoa. our phylogenetic analysis further showed that p300/kat3b, the acetyltransferase that modifies the rpb <dig> ctd, was present at the appearance k7-containing repeats. we then performed a genome-wide survey of acrpb <dig> occupancy and its influence on gene regulation in mice. genes with enrichment for acrpb <dig> at their promoters and genes dysregulated when acrpb <dig> was disrupted were specifically enriched for functions in growth-factor signaling, cell adhesion, vascular development, and cell-cell interaction. in addition, the two sets of acrpb <dig> sensitive genes were enriched for evolutionary origins in early eukaryotes through the ancestor of euteleostomi . together, our functional and evolutionary results support a model in which k7-containing ctds were selected for in the early history of animal multicellularity. given the association between polymerase pausing and acrpb <dig>  the potential to acetylate these residues may have enabled tighter control of gene expression as animals grew in complexity and diversified. indeed, acrpb <dig> now influences the regulation of growth factor-target genes and genes involved in lineage-specific processes, such as cell adhesion and vasculature development, in mammals.

RESULTS
the rpb <dig> ctd experienced an expansion in repeat number and lysine content in the early history of animals
the rpb <dig> ctd has undergone considerable change during the evolution of eukaryotes  <cit> . while the consensus repeat sequence y1s2p3t4s5p6s <dig> is conserved from yeast to mammals, the number of repeats varies: s. cerevisiae has only  <dig> repeats, while humans have  <dig> . conserved heptad repeats are found in the linker-proximal part of the mammalian ctd, but the sequence of the distal heptad repeats, which are not present in yeast, diverge from this consensus sequence. eight of the non-consensus repeats in human and mouse ctds carry a lysine at position  <dig> , rather than serine.figure  <dig> 
the human rna polymerase ii subunit  <dig>  c-terminal domain  contains more heptad repeats than the yeasts, and eight of its non-consensus distal repeats have a lysine residue. in this schematic of the rpb <dig> ctd for two species of yeast and human, consensus heptad repeats  are colored dark gray; repeats with a lysine at position  <dig> are colored red; and all other non-consensus repeats are in white.



to gain insight into the origins of mammalian k7-containing repeats, we modeled the evolutionary dynamics of ctd repeats in a phylogenetically diverse collection of eukaryotes with sequenced rpb <dig> genes . human, mouse, and zebrafish were selected as representative vertebrate species, based on their phylogenetic placement and sequence data quality. in addition to the three vertebrates, we also examined ctd amino acid sequences for  <dig> other eukaryotes, including worms, insects, fungi, plants, algae, and several recently sequenced early branching animals. for each species, we counted the number of ctd repeats overall, the number of consensus repeats, and the number of repeats with lysine residues .figure  <dig> 
lysine-containing ctd repeats first appeared in metazoa and increased in prevalence in the ancestor of deuterostomia. phylogenetic tree of eukaryotic species considered in our analysis organized by approximate divergence estimates. for each species, the number of rpb <dig> ctd repeats and lysine-containing repeats are given. ancestral counts were inferred for each internal node of the tree using symmetric wagner parsimony. the number of ctd heptad repeats increased substantially in the ancestor of all metazoa . this was accompanied by the appearance of repeats with lysine at position seven  in ancestral metazoa and an increase in k <dig> repeats in deuterostomia .



ancestral state reconstruction using symmetric wagner parsimony on the species phylogeny revealed an expansion of ctd repeats in the common ancestor of all metazoa , as expected from previous studies  <cit> . we estimate that the ancestor of all metazoa had  <dig> repeats, while the last common ancestor of metazoa and their closest relatives, the choanoflagellates, had only  <dig> repeats. k7-containing repeats also first appeared consistently in the ancestor of metazoa, and this was followed by an increase in the number of k7-containing repeats  in the last common ancestor of deuterosomia. all the cnidaria and ecdysozoa examined have k7-containing repeats, but with the exception of the deer tick  and hydra , the number is comparatively small . the plants, algae, and other eukaryotes we examined have half as many or fewer repeats as the metazoa, and only one has more than two lysine-containing repeats: plasmodium falciparum, a human pathogen.  thus, we conclude that ctd repeat length markedly increased with the origin of animals, and the distal repeats gained lysine residues and expanded further in different animal lineages. these results are in agreement with an extensive study of ctd repeat number and content that appeared while this manuscript was in preparation  <cit> .

we found variations on the consensus ctd heptad repeat in all clades . overall, the seventh position of the heptad repeat is the most variable, but different clades exhibit different patterns of variation. lysines are common in the seventh position among the deuterostomes, and the repeat profiles for individual deuterostome species  are more similar to one another than for any other clade. they average only 3% difference between species. in ecdysozoa, positions four, five, and six are more variable than in other clades, with serines and alanines common in position four. fungal ctd repeats, with the exception of those in aspergillus oryzae , largely exhibit the consensus sequence; however, they have more variation in the first position than other clades. we also note that some species have a small amount of additional non-repetitive sequence beyond the ctd repeats. ctd repeat counts and sequences for all species examined are given in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.figure  <dig> 
sequence logos summarizing repeat sequence variation in fungi, ecdysozoa, and deuterostomia. sequence logos were generated from all heptad repeat sequences of relevant species using the logoddslogo tool  <cit> . most repeat positions are strongly conserved, but different clades exhibit different variations. lysine is particularly common at position seven in deuterostomia. see additional file  <dig> for rpb <dig> sequences for all species examined.



the acetyltransferase p <dig> was present for the metazoan increase in ctd repeat count and lysine content
the p300/kat3b acetyltransferase was shown to efficiently target and acetylate the mammalian rpb <dig> ctd, while another kat enzyme, pcaf/kat2b, did not  <cit> . recent analysis of the capsaspora owczarzaki genome revealed that p300/kat3b and its paralog, cbp/kat3a, were present before the divergence of capsaspora from choanoflagellates and metazoans  <cit> . to further refine this estimate, we searched for homologs in the additional early branching holozoan species considered in our ctd analysis and other eukaryotic genomes. all tested holozoans contain a gene with significant homology  to human/mouse p <dig> and cbp; thus, the ancestor of this gene was present for the metazoan expansion of the ctd and introduction of k7-containing repeats. homologs of this family are present in plants  <cit> , but we did not find clear homologs in the fungi. this suggests that the kat <dig> family may be a more ancient eukaryotic family that has been lost in some lineages and maintained in others.

we also determined the phylogenetic age of  <dig> kat enzymes with expressed in both mouse and humans  <cit>  using proteinhistorian  <cit> , a web server that estimates protein ages, and found a wide range of predicted evolutionary ages .

acetylation of rpb <dig> regulates many mammalian genes
mutating the rpb <dig> ctd to prevent acetylation was shown to disrupt the expression of two immediate-early genes  in the epidermal growth factor  and erk/mapk pathways with paused polymerases, but it did not influence the expression of several housekeeping genes  <cit> . to explore the functional relevance of acetylation of the rpb <dig> ctd genome-wide, we analyzed two sets of genes influenced, directly and indirectly, by acrpb <dig>  first, we analyzed the total and acetylated rna pol ii promoter occupancy in mouse embryonic stem cell  chip-seq data from schroeder et al.  <cit> . we found  <dig>  genes with acetylated rna pol ii occupancy at their promoters, and  <dig> genes with significant enrichment for acetylated rna pol ii at their promoters over total rna pol ii levels . we will refer to these gene sets as “acrpb <dig> occupied” and “acrpb <dig> enriched,” respectively. second, we expressed a mutated murine ha-tagged rpb <dig> in which all k <dig> residues were substituted by arginines  in mouse nih/3 t <dig> fibroblasts . this mutation prevents acetylation while preserving the positive charge at these positions. gene expression profiling using microarrays identified  <dig> rnas that were significantly  <  <dig> ) up- or down-regulated in 8kr cells compared to wild type cells. we refer to these as “acrpb <dig> dysregulated genes”. in the following, we focus on the acrpb <dig> enriched genes, which reflect the direct influence of acrpb <dig>  and the acrpb <dig> dysregulated genes, which summarize the broader downstream effects of rpb <dig> acetylation.

there was significant overlap between the acrpb <dig> enriched and dysregulated genes . the relatively modest magnitude of this overlap likely reflects the different origins of the gene sets. the chip-seq was performed on escs, while the microarrays are from fibroblasts. acrpb <dig> is likely involved in many context-dependent responses in different cells, and a gene with enrichment for acrpb <dig> at its promoter in one context is not necessarily dysregulated in all contexts if the ability to acetylate rpb <dig> is lost. it also suggests that some genes dysregulated in the disruption of acrpb <dig> may not be directly regulated by acrpb <dig>  however, it is also possible that some differences in the gene sets result from technical artifacts due to the different experimental techniques used to define them.

genes influenced by acetylation of rpb <dig> are enriched for functions in growth-factor response, cell adhesion, regulation of gene expression, and vasculature development
we used david  <cit>  to calculate gene ontology biological process  annotations and kegg pathways enriched among acrpb <dig> enriched  and dysregulated genes . to account for the many annotations tested, we considered tests with expected fdr <  <dig>  significant. the acrpb <dig> enriched genes are annotated with general regulatory go bp functions more often than expected by chance; for example, protein amino acid phosphorylation  and negative regulation of gene expression  are both significantly enriched. the dysregulated genes are enriched in go bp functions in cell adhesion , vasculature development , and blood vessel development . the top kegg pathway enrichments for both gene sets were largely consistent with the go bp analysis, though some did not maintain significance after fdr-based multiple test correction. within kegg, the acrpb <dig> enriched genes had nominally significant overlap  with genes involved in several developmental signaling pathways, focal adhesion, and actin cytoskeleton regulation . similarly, the dysregulated genes showed enrichment for the focal adhesion  and extracellular matrix receptor interaction  pathways, as well as weaker associations with pathways involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation, axon guidance, and several signaling and metabolic pathways . thus, the direct and indirect targets of acrpb <dig> appear to be involved preferentially in regulation , cell adhesion, and vasculature development.table  <dig>

the disruption of acrpb <dig> was previously shown to abolish expression of two epidermal growth-factor-induced genes, c-fos and egr <dig>  in mouse fibroblasts  <cit> . in order to further explore the connection between egf-induced genes and rpb <dig> ctd acetylation, we analyzed the expression and promoter acrpb <dig> occupancy of several curated sets of growth factor responsive genes. first, we identified  <dig> mouse homologs of human genes whose transcription is directly induced by egf signaling   <cit> . overall, egf-induced genes overlap significantly with acrpb <dig> enriched genes , as well as the dysregulated genes . the association between acrpb <dig> and egf became even stronger when we considered promoter acrpb <dig> occupancy : 73%  of egf genes had acrpb <dig> occupancy . similarly, the number of egf genes nominally dysregulated  was also significant .

given the association between acrpb <dig> and egf-induced genes, we investigated whether acrpb <dig> regulated genes induced by other growth factors by analyzing  <dig> genes induced by platelet-derived growth factor   <cit> . there was a similar enrichment for pdgf-induced genes among acrpb <dig> occupied  and dysregulated  genes, but not among acrpb <dig> enriched genes . thus, genes induced by both growth factors are regulated by acetylation of the rpb <dig> ctd, though perhaps mostly indirectly in the case of pdgf. supporting this conclusion, egf-induced genes were more strongly enriched among acrpb1-enriched genes than pdgf-induced genes , but both growth factors were similarly represented among dysregulated genes . fifteen genes were present in both the egf- and pdgf-induced sets; the above results were similar when these genes were not considered in the analysis.

growth factor-induced genes can be split into two categories: immediate-early genes  and delayed primary response genes , which are transcribed after the iegs, but before secondary response genes  <cit> . these two classes are relevant, because their transcription occurs before de novo protein synthesis, and thus they reflect the direct effects of growth factor signaling versus those further downstream. regardless of the growth factor, both iegs and dprgs were enriched among acrpb1-occupied and -dysregulated genes, but the effect was stronger for iegs than dprgs  supporting the hypothesis that acrpb <dig> targets many iegs.

many genes regulated by acetylation of rpb <dig> originated early in the evolution of eukaryotes and animals
evolutionary analysis by proteinhistorian showed that acrpb1-enriched genes had a significantly different age distribution from all genes with occupancy data . the acrpb1-enriched genes were significantly enriched for origins on the branch from opisthokonta to bilateria , the branch from chordata to euteleostomi , and the ancestral eukaryote branch .  comparing the evolutionary origins of dysregulated genes to the background of all genes on the array revealed a similar age pattern . in particular, the dysregulated genes were enriched for origins in the ancestral eukaryote, the early history of animals , and shortly thereafter on the deuterostomia to chordata and chordata to euteleostomi branches . both gene sets showed consistent depletion of genes born after the origin of amniotes. thus, two independent ways of defining genes influenced by acrpb <dig> underscore a potential role for k <dig> acetylation in regulating rna polymerase ii function at genes that were present as animal multicellularity developed and diversified .figure  <dig> 
genes regulated by acrpb <dig> are significantly enriched for evolutionary origins from early eukaryotes through early animals. proteinhistorian analysis of the evolutionary origins of acrpb <dig> enriched genes  and acrpb <dig> dysregulated genes  compared with relevant background gene sets. each bar gives the difference between the proportion of genes of interest and background genes originating in the last common ancestor of a given taxon . the proportion of genes of interest with origins in each taxon is given along the x-axis. for example, 18% of the acrpb <dig> enriched genes likely appeared between the origin of opisthokonta and bilateria, and this is significantly more  than expected from the background of all genes with occupancy data.



many genes involved in functions enriched among the acrpb1-regulated genes have origins close to the origin of k <dig> repeat-containing ctds or later during the origin and radiation of vertebrates . the window between the k <dig> repeat expansion and the diversification of vertebrates is enriched with the origin of acrpb1-regulated genes. for example, the egf-induced genes are significantly enriched for origins on the branch leading to euteleostomi , as are the pdgf-induced genes  . consistent with this pattern, twelve of the  <dig>  genes in the egf signal transduction pathway , which are necessary for egf induction, were born between the origin of bilateria and euteleostomi; three were present in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes , and only one appeared after the euteleostomi . thus, this pathway’s evolutionary history mirrors that of the genes influenced by acrpb <dig> .figure  <dig>

discussion
acrpb <dig> likely first occurred early in the development of animals
our integrated evolutionary and functional analyses of rpb <dig>  its modifiers, regulators, and targets suggest that the potential for acrpb <dig> was present in early animals. while we cannot definitively establish the timing of the first acrpb <dig> event, several lines of evidence suggest that acrpb <dig> began to occur soon after k7-containing heptad repeats appeared during the increase in rpb <dig> ctd repeat length in the metazoan ancestor. first, elevated repeat count and k7-containing repeats are present in nearly all metazoa. second, k7-containing repeats are rare outside of metazoa. third, the ancestor of the p <dig> kat enzyme, which acetylates ctd k <dig> residues, was present when the ctd expanded. fourth, the genes bound and regulated by acrpb <dig> are enriched for evolutionary origins before and during the appearance and diversification of animals and depleted for origins more recent than the last common ancestor of all bony vertebrates . finally, the functions enriched among genes regulated by acrpb <dig> suggest involvement in traits essential to the origin and development of complex animal multicellularity.

acrpb <dig> may have served as a basis for establishing the regulation of some functions essential to complex multicellular animals
transitions to multicellular lifestyles require organisms to perform a range of new functions that facilitate cell adhesion, cell-cell signalling, and context-dependent gene expression  <cit> . we found enrichment for functions in cell adhesion, extracellular matrix signaling, gene regulation, and phosphorylation among genes influenced by acrpb <dig> . this suggests a connection between new regulatory mechanisms, such as polymerase pausing, enabled by acrpb <dig> and the development of animal multicellularity. in addition, the enrichment for vascular development among the genes sensitive to acrpb <dig> supports the involvement of acrpb <dig> in the later development and regulation of animal body plan complexity. indeed, intercellular regulation of proliferation, differentiation, and migration by paracrine factors such as egf is a unique feature of higher eukaryotes and lies at the root of body complexity in animals  <cit> . our analyses show that proper regulation of genes induced by two growth factors, egf and pdgf, is dependent on the presence of k <dig> residues in the ctd. while our study explicitly provides evidence for the importance of k <dig> residues in egf- and pdgf-induced transcription, it also suggests that other signal transduction pathways in higher eukaryotes may rely on k <dig> residues for proper gene activation.

what is the role of acrpb <dig> in different animal lineages?
the eukaryotic rpb <dig> ctd experiences posttranslational phosphorylation and methylation modifications that are essential for proper regulation of its activity. the initial expansion in ctd repeat number during the origin of metazoa likely increased the potential for these rpb <dig> modifications. our work suggests that acrpb <dig> appeared soon after this initial expansion. the integration of k <dig> residues into the rpb <dig> heptad repeat appears to predate the divergence of the cnidaria, ecdysozoa, and deuterostomia; however, these clades exhibit differences in the number and type of repeats. deuterostomes exhibit dramatic and consistent high k <dig> count . nonetheless, the presence of at least one k7-containing repeat is conserved in all species analyzed in these clades, and some species  have high k <dig> counts. given the role of acrpb <dig> in promoter-proximal polymerase pausing  <cit>  and the importance of pausing in non-deuterostome species, such as drosophila melanogaster  <cit> , it is possible that acrpb <dig> occurs commonly in these species in spite of their lower k <dig> content. indeed, a single k7-containing repeat in a modified mouse ctd was sufficient to produce detectable acetylation in vitro  <cit> . most pausing research has been performed in human, mouse, or fly, and the full phylogenetic range of polymerase pausing is not known. however, it appears that pausing is rare in caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> , a species with only one k <dig> repeat, but systematic studies of pausing and acrpb <dig> in a more diverse array of species are necessary to resolve this question.

acrpb <dig> may be associated with developmental complexity in different eukaryotic lineages
recent work has established the plasticity of the rpb <dig> ctd across eukaryotes and suggested that lineage-specific ctd modifications are associated with increased complexity in different multicellular lineages  <cit> . while our work does not prove the involvement of acrpb <dig> in the development of animal multicellularity, it suggests that this novel regulatory mechanism may have played a role in the establishment of the complex gene regulatory programs necessary for the proper cooperation of different cells within complex multicellular animals, in addition to known expansions and rearrangements of gene families  <cit> .

the presence of a non-consensus k <dig> repeat in many plant species  <cit>  suggests the possibility that acrpb <dig> could have evolved in parallel in another developmentally complex multicellular lineage. however, it is not known whether plant k <dig> repeats are acetylated.

why are many k7-containing repeats seen in some species of malaria?
k7-containing repeats are rare outside of animals, yet in agreement with previous studies, we see many k <dig> repeats in p. falciparum, a parasite that causes malaria in humans . in general, plasmodium species have very short repeat regions with high variability between and within species  <cit> . primate-infecting plasmodium species have many k <dig> repeats, yet this is not true of those that infect other mammals, like rodents, and birds. analysis of the ctds of many plasmodium species suggests that expansion of k <dig> repeats in the ctd occurred twice in parallel in different lineages of primate parasites; however, the forces driving these independent primate-specific expansions are not known. the establishment of the acetylation of the ctd  <cit>  and its importance in regulating many ancient genes suggests that ctd acetylation may be involved. however, since acrpb <dig> occurs in mice, the presence of k <dig> repeats and acrpb <dig> in the host does not necessarily result in high k <dig> content in the plasmodium ctd. horizontal transfer of epigenetic regulators, like the set <dig> and set <dig> methyltransferase domains, occurred in the ancestor of apicomplexans and has been linked to their transition to parasitism  <cit> . the set <dig> domain interacts with the ctd, but it is absent in rodent infecting plasmodium species. this suggests that there may be differences in the epigenetic methylation and acetylation of the ctd in plasmodium species infecting different mammals, but the nature and effects of these modifications remain uncertain.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we trace the evolutionary origin of k7-containing rpb <dig> ctd repeats to the early history of animals. our integrated evolutionary and functional analyses suggest that the potential for acrpb <dig> was present at this time and suggest, due to the conserved increased ctd repeat count and k <dig> content, that acrpb <dig> is a common regulatory mechanism in many animals. most studies of the genetic changes involved in transitions to animal multicellularity have implicated expansions or rearrangements of gene families  <cit> . while our work does not prove the involvement of acrpb <dig> in this transition, it suggests that this novel regulatory mechanism may have provided a foundation on which gene regulatory programs involved in the proper function and cooperation of different cells within complex multicellular animals could be built.
