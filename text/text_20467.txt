BACKGROUND
large-scale gene expression data provide snapshots of transcription activity at a genome-wide scale. there is a growing wealth of gene expression data available in public databases  and as well as the capability for easily generating additional data using high-throughput technologies.

many methods for the statistical analysis of gene expression data exist  <cit> . initially data analyses for differential expression focuse on a single gene at a time  <cit> . these one-gene-at-a-time analyses separate data into groups depending on the phenotypic status and perform gene-by-gene analysis. however recently the focus has shifted to higher order coexpression patterns  with the belief that they may reflect more fully the complex interactions between genes  <cit> .

one type of multi-dimensional differential expression analysis is called liquid association. liquid association  describes the extent to which coexpression of two genes  may vary based on the expression level of a third gene , with the third gene being viewed as a controller gene that can represent the pathway status or the cellular state  <cit> . liquid association has been demonstrated to be useful in identifying disease candidate genes for multiple sclerosis and performing dimension reduction for candidate genes in survival studies  <cit> . li’s work  <cit>  applied la in two distinct ways. the first fixed a controller gene  or a small subset of controller genes and searched for pairs of genes  that showed significant liquid association while the second method reversed this process, specifying one or both of the pair of genes  and searching for a controller gene  that regulates their correlation  <cit> .

software is available to assist in the calculation of individual liquid association triplets as in li’s work, and one study has performed brute-force exhaustive searches for liquid association  <cit> ; however neither of these approaches are efficient for genome-wide use. computational analyses for la on a genome-wide scale have proven more intractable due to the issue of dimensionality, with the number of possible combinations increasing exponentially in a situation where the number of samples is already greatly exceeded by the number of genes potentially of interest. for example, in a typical microarray with  <dig>  genes, there are more than  <dig> × <dig> all possible triplet combinations need to be examined in a exhaustive search. in other words, assuming each la calculation took one one-thousandth of a second, the full calculation of all possible values when performed in sequence would still take approximately  <dig>  years. obviously a different approach is needed. thus in this paper, we develop a fast-screening algorithm with an r software package available for applying liquid association in a genome-wide scale search and implement it in a yeast data set.

methods
data set
we used the yeast dataset described in  <cit> . yeast is a model organism for studying complex gene interdependencies due to its short generation time, ease of culture, and that yeast’s fundamental biological processes are conserved among all eukaryotes, which allows us to apply the increased understanding obtained to other organisms  <cit> . the raw data set is publically available at the yeast cell cycle analysis project website and was also available in  <cit> . the data set contains the gene expression measures for  <dig>  yeast genes under  <dig> normal growth conditions and was intended to represent a comprehensive catalog for transcripts that vary periodically within the cell cycle  <cit> .

methods for estimating liquid association
li  <cit>  used e to measure the co-expression of x <dig> and x <dig>  and ultimately results in an estimation of la=e, with the standard error obtainable by bootstrap  <cit> . ho et al.  <cit>  noted that li’s measure does not account for instances where the conditional means and variances of x <dig> and x <dig> may depend on x <dig> and proposed a new measure named modified liquid association . compared to li’s original measure, mla is able to consider more intricate co-dependencies among these variables and was proven to be more robust for data analysis applications  <cit> . hence in the following analysis, we applied mla to assess the magnitude of liquid association.

to estimate mla, both a robust direct estimate and a trivariate conditional normal model  framework were proposed in  <cit> . for instances where the cnm does not fit the data well, the more robust direct estimate with bootstrapping standard error can be used.

the focus of the paper is to develop a screening algorithm which would make it faster to perform a genome-wide analysis of a data set to check for evidence of dependent coexpression. our algorithm named fast liquid association  seeks to reduce the number of triplets needing to be examined in depth in two steps:  screening and  model fitting and estimation. as illustrated in figure  <dig>  after proper preprocessing, in the screening step triplets unlikely to have a significant la value were removed. the screening step relies on the |ρdiff| score, with ρdiff defined as:
  ρdiff=ρhigh−ρlow, figure  <dig> 
a process map of the fastla algorithm.




where ρhigh is the pearson correlation when the third controller gene  is high  and ρlow is the correlation when x <dig> is low . ρdiff is a suitable screening measure for liquid association for the following reasons:  in the situation when x <dig> is discretized into three values: − <dig> , <dig> by tertile binning, ρdiff equals to the liquid association measure by definition:
 la=change in coexpressionchange inx3=change inρchange inx3=ρhigh−ρmedium1−0+ρmedium−ρlow0−=ρhigh−ρlow, 

where ρmedian is the correlation when x <dig> is in the middle tertile. triplet combinations that exhibit large ρdiff value are likely to manifest large liquid association.  ρdiff can be computed much more quickly through matrix algebra than mla estimation.

after the first screening step, triplet combinations with a large |ρdiff| value were retained for further model fitting and estimation. as illustrated in figure  <dig>  during the second step of the algorithm, the magnitude of liquid association is estimated through the cnm if the model fits the triplet data well. two versions for estimating mla using the cnm are available, a full and simple version of the model, depending on which model fits the triplet data better. in the case when the cnm model does not adequately describe the data, the robust estimation can be used instead. more detail about the cnm and robust estimation procedure are described in  <cit> . gene set enrichment analysis using gene ontology  <cit>  were performed for the top triplet combinations identified in the yeast dataset  <cit> .

RESULTS
validation
similar to the approach applied by both li  <cit>  and ho et al.  <cit> , we first performed a normal quantile transformation of the data so that marginally each variable was normally distributed. this approach could also help to reduce the number of potential outliers in the data. in addition, each gene was also standardized to have mean  <dig> and variance  <dig>  we removed any genes with greater than  <dig> % missing values. this reduced the number of genes being tested to  <dig> . we randomly pick  <dig> genes and  <dig> genes from the yeast data set to determine agreement between ρdiff and liquid association estimates mla^. the results are shown in figure 2; in the plot on the left, the correlation between ρdiff and mla^ is  <dig>  in the  <dig> gene subset;  <dig>  in the  <dig> gene subset as illustrated by the plot in the middle;  <dig>  for simulated data from multivariate normal distribution with mean  <dig> and identify variance-covariance matrix on the right. when absolute values were not taken, there was  <dig> % agreement in sign. we performed simple linear regression: |ρdiff|=α+β∗|mla^|. interestingly, the β estimates are approximately  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  respectively in the  <dig> subset,  <dig> subset, and simulated data from multivariate normal distribution. this value compares well to the possible maximum values for |ρdiff|  and |mla^|2/π as 2/2/π= <dig> .comparison for all triplets of

using the  <dig> genes subset, we performed the fastla and an exhaustive analysis in order to perform a speed comparison as well as to test for sensitivity. based on sensitivity analyses, the data was separated into three bins for the model-based estimate of mla to minimize mean squared error according to ho et al.  <cit> . testing was performed at |ρdiff|= <dig>  and  <dig> . the proportion of the top |mla^|  <dig>  triplet sets found using fastla versus those found using exhaustive liquid association analysis was >99% for both |ρdiff|= <dig>  and  <dig>  . the proportion of the top |mla^|  <dig>  triplets missed by varying values of |ρdiff| are shown in figure  <dig> the percent missed in the top

by narrowing the triplets with |ρdiff|> <dig> , we reduced the number of the triplet combinations needed to be examined from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig>  triplets  in the  <dig> gene subset analysis. in the middle plot of figure  <dig>  only two out of  <dig> , <dig> triplets  have |mla|> <dig>   and are missed by ρdiff> <dig>  screening criteria. because of discretizing x <dig>  there is a small reduction of resolution for measuring mla using ρdiff in these two cases. however, the reduction in run time was substantial due to a much smaller number of triplets needed to be examined after the screening. compared to the exhaustive analysis, the relative run time required for completion using the fastla algorithm was  <dig> % when using |ρdiff|= <dig>  as the cut-off threshold and  <dig> % when using |ρdiff|= <dig>  . processing was performed on servers at the minnesota supercomputing institute on two-socket, quad-core  <dig>  ghz intel xeon x <dig> nehalem ep processors with  <dig> gb of ram.

we set |ρdiff|= <dig>  and implemented the fastla algorithm in the yeast dataset. after the first screening step,  <dig> × <dig>  triplets out of  <dig> × <dig> triplets remained in the second step. the results were sorted using the model-based estimation for liquid association. the top  <dig> triplet combinations are shown in table  <dig> sorted by p-value  <cit> , and a fuller list of the top  <dig>  triplets is presented in the additional file  <dig>  in table  <dig>  the model column represents the way the p-value was derived . for genes where the function is characterized, the refseq gene symbol is reported. for those genes whose function has not yet been characterized, the open reading frame id was reported instead. in addition, we analyzed the data separately by four synchronization conditions in which the yeast experiments were performed. the box plots of gene expression, and the top  <dig> triplets with large mla values in each synchronization condition are provided in the additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> respectively.top  <dig> triplets by p-value

given that the spellmen et al. experiments created nutrient-depleted conditions for growth, it is biologically feasible to see that for the controller position , many top terms are involved energy regulation such as carbohydrate derivative, glycogen, and polysaccharide biosynthesis described in table  <dig>  glycogen in yeast is formed during periods where carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus or sulfur is limited  <cit> . in addition, several top terms are related to transportation of cellular molecules such as vitamin, sulfur compound, and ion. furthermore, gpi-anchor protein biosynthesis could be related to cell wall formation for sporulation during nutrient-depleted environment.

the results from the analyses using the full triplet set trend toward functions of energy regulation, and transport of molecules as shown in table  <dig>  glycolysis is related to the utilization of glucose. in addition, regulation of lipid, carbohydrate, hexose, purine ribonucleotide could also be involved in energy regulation process. the findings presented by go analysis could suggest feasible biological hypotheses; however, liquid association measure describes ‘association” between gene triplet, but it does not necessary confers “causation.” further functional experiments will be needed to validate the top triplets identified with large mla values.

discussion
in the data analysis, we set |ρdiff|= <dig> . there are a few considerations about setting the threshold value for |ρdiff|. the maximum value is theoretically  <dig> . for general use, too high a value for |ρdiff| risks missing those triplets whose mla values are not fully reflected by the more simplistic correlation, while too low a value approaches testing all possible triplets and forfeits any increase in testing efficiency. we set the default value at  <dig>   as we found > <dig> % of the triplets with a large mla were captured by setting |ρdiff|= <dig>  in the validation subset. if we increase the threshold for the |ρdiff| cutoff, we could further decrease time without substantial loss in sensitivity. of the top  <dig>  triplets, only  <dig> would have been missed using a cutoff of |ρdiff|= <dig> . however, this would have substantially decreased the number of triplets that needed to be checked for mla estimates, which in turn would have helped decrease memory usage and overall processing time.

in the algorithm, ρdiff is calculated based on the difference between a “high” versus “low” subset of the data for each gene in the controller position. initially the median  was used as the demarcation between the high and low subsets. however, we found that the central points diluted the ρdiff estimate and decreased sensitivity. the algorithm was respecified to split the data into three parts based on the x <dig> values, with high being the top third and low being the bottom third in our analysis. by using the upper and lower tertiles for z expression, the values of ρdiff increase in triplets with large liquid association and hence increase the sensitivity to identify triplets with large mla values. based on data obtained in the verification process, we used this specification of the algorithm in this analysis. furthermore, the splitting of x <dig> can be easily modified for other analysis; however, in practice, we suggest to have between  <dig> to  <dig> samples as recommended by ho et al.  <cit>  samples in each bin to achieve stable estimates of ρ.

during the course of parameter estimations using the cnm models, we identified a subset of triplets where the cnm does not fit the data well. in total, of the  <dig> × <dig> triplets that were tested using the full model,  <dig>  triplets can not be adequately described by the cnm full model.

of these  <dig>  triplets,  <dig>   triplets were estimated using the simple cnm model, and  <dig>   were estimated using the robust method. after investigating these triplets, we identified the following possible explanations for why they are not appropriately fit by the cnm:  the distribution of x <dig> x <dig> is not bivariate normal with respect to x <dig>   the change in ρx1x2|x <dig> is non-linear with respect to x <dig>  or  the model’s reliance on pearson correlation makes it more sensitive to outliers. none of the triplets tested using the direct estimate method were found to be of sufficiently low adjusted p-value to be included in the set of the top gene triplet combinations. figure  <dig> provides example scatter plots of triplets that do not fit the cnm well. the first row is an example of non-linear changes in correlation with regards to the value of the x <dig> gene. the second row provides an illustration of the bins’ susceptibility to outliers, in the that correlation for both the leftmost and center plots would be changed without the single outlier on the left. in these cases, the robust estimation procedure is more appropriate to assess the magnitude of liquid association.triplets with lack of fit to the conditional normal model . the x

a concern that has been raised in regards to using hypergeometric-based tests is the problem of defining the gene universe. when a larger gene universe is used, it in general will tend to  have the effect of making the p-value seem more significant  <cit> . given the genome-wide scope and nature of our testing , it was decided that all analyzed genes would be included in the gene universe for analysis and the results interpreted conservatively. while the data used from spellman et al. were obtained from cdna arrays and thus more likely to have prior rationale of biological plausibility for probe inclusion, for commercial chips performing some non-specific filtering prior to analysis may help reduce the size of the gene universe and manage to avoid the issue.

CONCLUSIONS
we proposed the fastla algorithm for exploring liquid association in a genome-wide scale. some modifications of the fast liquid association algorithm could be:  for binary traits, ρdiff can be used as the liquid association measure. our algorithm can be easily adapted to the binary case,  use a rank-based correlation statistic. using non-parametric correlation would make the model more robust to outliers and potential violations of the assumption that the variables are bivariately normally distributed; however, rank-based correlation statistic could be less statistically powerful comparing to the pearson correlation.

on the basis of the results of this study, it appears that ρdiff would be an appropriate screening metric for mla in use for exploratory genome-wide searches and that both metrics are suitable for identifying triplets of interest. given the high correlation observed between ρdiff and mla and the increased speed of calculation of ρdiff due to its matrix manipulation to perform the estimate, this would significantly reduce both processing time and memory requirements. while there remain reservations that ρdiff may not be suitable for a comprehensive identification of triplets of significant p-values, nevertheless it is a fast and efficient screening tool to identify potentially significant gene triplets using liquid association.
