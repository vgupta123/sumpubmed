BACKGROUND
land plants uptake carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and lose water vapour by transpiration through stomatal pores, present on the surface of leaves and stems. the opening and closure of the pore is mediated by turgor-driven volume changes of two surrounding guard cells, whose pressure is dynamically adjusted according to environmental and hormonal cues. in response to abiotic stresses, such as drought or high salinity, one of the most rapid responses of plants is the closure of stomata, mediated by the hormone abscisic acid , to prevent excessive water loss by transpiration .

the genetic manipulation of stomatal activity is emerging as a promising approach to reduce the water requirement of crops, and to enhance productivity under stress conditions  <cit> . proper engineering of stomatal responses requires the use of guard cell-specific promoters, or the identification of guard cell-specific mutants, to avoid undesirable side effects on plant growth and productivity.

several promoters that confer guard cell-specific gene expression or enhanced gene expression in guard cells have been isolated through different methods: functional characterization of single genes  <cit> ; large scale gene- or enhancer-trap screens  <cit> . moreover transcriptomic and proteomic studies have identified additional candidates  <cit> . nevertheless the majority of these promoters are not guard cell-specific, as they drive the expression of reporter genes in other cell types, including the vascular tissues  <cit> , flower organs  <cit>  or starch containing cells  <cit> , significantly reducing the number of true guard cell-specific full size promoters  <cit> . most importantly, a detailed experimental analysis of guard cell-specific promoters has been performed only in very few cases  <cit> .

a true guard cell-specific promoter is driving expression of the arabidopsis atmyb <dig>  gene  <cit> . we have previously shown that atmyb <dig> is expressed in guard cells  <cit> , and the complete 5' and 3' intergenic genomic regions of this gene, cloned respectively upstream and downstream to reporter genes, were able to drive specific expression in guard cells  <cit> . guard cell specificity of the atmyb <dig> promoter has been also demonstrated by nagy et al.  and by meyer et al , who used this promoter to complement the mrp5- <dig> mutant phenotype exclusively in guard cells, and to specifically express the atlmt <dig> protein at high levels in guard cells, respectively.

very little information is available concerning promoter cis-elements regulating guard cell-specific expression  <cit> . dof-binding sites have been suggested to have a role in such a regulation  <cit> . dof  proteins are plant specific transcription factors involved in light, phytohormones and pathogen signalling and responses as well as seed development . a role for aaag dof-binding sites in mediating gene expression in guard cells has been experimentally defined only for the potato kst <dig> gene  <cit> . however, in arabidopsis the role of dof-motifs in controlling guard cell expression is still controversial  <cit> . the study performed on the potato kst <dig> promoter  <cit>  and the bioinformatic analysis performed on several guard-cell specific arabidopsis promoters  <cit>  suggest that the presence of clusters of dof cis-elements, rather than their absolute number, is important to confer guard cell-specificity to a promoter region  <cit> . yet, the role of dof-binding sites in driving guard cell expression in arabidopsis and the hypothesis of cluster organization remains to be experimentally investigated.

the guard-cell specific atmyb <dig> promoter presents several dof clusters, making it an ideal model to test the hypothesis that dof clusters are important for guard cell-specific expression. moreover the atmyb <dig> expression is modulated by different environmental cues such as light, dark and drought stress  <cit> , suggesting the presence of different cis-elements controlling these transcriptional responses. in this report we aimed to isolate the cis-elements responsible for the atmyb <dig> guard cell specific expression. we generated arabidopsis transgenic lines carrying truncated or mutagenised atmyb <dig> promoter versions fused to the gus reporter gene. using a combination of histochemical and expression analysis we were able to identify a minimal promoter necessary and sufficient to drive guard cell specific expression. using the same tools, we were also able to map a region required for aba-mediated repression.

RESULTS
in-silico analysis of the atmyb <dig> promoter
in a previous study, we demonstrated that the complete 5' and 3' atmyb <dig> intergenic genomic regions - cloned upstream and downstream of the Î²-glucoronidase  reporter gene, respectively - could specifically drive strong gus activity in stomata of arabidopsis seedlings and adult plants  <cit> . no gus signals were detected in any other cell type or in tissues devoid of stomata  <cit> .

to investigate the possible cis-acting elements that regulate atmyb <dig> expression, we surveyed the genomic region upstream of the atmyb <dig> translational start codon for the presence of known transcription factor binding sites using the place software  <cit> . our analysis produced a significant enrichment in the aaag motifs in the atmyb <dig> promoter compared to the average distribution of aaag oligos in intergenic regions throughout the arabidopsis genome  . interestingly, these aaag motifs, have been shown to be involved in the regulation of guard cell expression of the potato potassium channel kst <dig> gene  <cit> . also, clusters of aaag motifs, required for the binding of dof-type transcription factors  <cit> , were over represented in different guard cells-specific promoters  <cit> . in particular, galbiati and colleagues suggested, as guard cell-specific cis-element, a cluster of at least three aaag motifs located on the same strand within a region of  <dig> bp  <cit> . using the criteria previously described by galbiati and collaborators , we found three of these guard cell-specific clusters in the 5' intergenic region of the atmyb <dig> gene , suggesting a conserved mechanism for guard cell specific expression.

identification of the atmyb <dig> minimal promoter
to gain more insights into the cis-elements that regulate the atmyb <dig> expression in guard cells, we produced a set of arabidopsis transgenic lines carrying the complete  <dig>  bp 5' intergenic region upstream of the translational start codon fused to the reporter gus . gus staining analysis of  <dig> independent t <dig> lines revealed that this region contains all the cis-acting elements required for expression of the reporter in stomata , while no gus signals were detected in any other cell type or in tissues devoid of stomata .

next, we made a series of 5' deletions of the - <dig>  bp genomic region to define the minimum sequence length required for the expression in guard cells . these truncated promoters  were stably transferred to arabidopsis and  <dig> to  <dig> independent t <dig> transgenic lines were analysed in detail. deletions of the distal part of the  <dig>  bp region to position - <dig> , - <dig> , or - <dig>  from the atg codon, did not alter expression of the reporter in guard cells located on both vegetative and floral organs . further deletions  indicated that the  <dig> bp proximal region was sufficient to drive expression of the reporter in stomata . however, the removal of the region between - <dig> bp and - <dig> bp  completely abolished gus activity in guard cell . transgenic lines carrying the -205::gus fusion did not show gus staining in any other cell type, even after prolonged staining . this finding suggests that the  <dig> bp region located between positions - <dig> and - <dig> contains cis-elements essential for expression in stomatal guard cells. based on these results, we defined the - <dig> bp region upstream of the atg codon as the minimal promoter of the atmyb <dig> gene.

to thoroughly investigate quantitative differences in gus expression among lines carrying different deletion:reporter constructs, we determined the relative amount of gus transcript by quantitative rt-pcr . mrna samples derived from two representative independent lines  were analysed for each construct . lines harbouring the  <dig>  bp 5' intergenic region or the - <dig> deletion fused to the reporter, did not show any significant differences in their gus transcript accumulation. conversely, deletions to position - <dig> and - <dig> resulted in a two-fold decrease in gus expression compared to the - <dig> ::gus line, while deletion to position - <dig> resulted in a five-fold decrease . these results indicate that one or more sequences with function of enhancer are present in the genomic region between - <dig> bp and - <dig> bp and between - <dig> and - <dig> from the atg of atmyb <dig>  in accordance with the results obtained from the histochemical analysis, qrt-pcr experiments did not detect significant gus transcripts accumulation in lines carrying the -205::gus fusion.

site-directed mutagenesis of the atmyb <dig> minimal promoter
promoter deletion experiments indicate that the atmyb <dig> minimal promoter region  contains all the cis-acting elements required to sustain expression of a reporter gene in guard cells. this region encompasses the aaag cluster proximal to the atg codon, which consists of four aaaag dof-binding sites . in addition, the place software identified in this region a single w-box, corresponding to the binding site of wrky transcription factors  <cit> , located upstream of the aaag cluster . to address the functional significance of the individual cis-elements present in the atmyb <dig> minimal promoter, we evaluated the effects of targeted nucleotide substitutions on gus expression . mutated versions of the minimal promoter were generated by pcr and fused to gus and at least  <dig> t <dig> independent transgenic lines for each mutated promoter::gus combination were visually scored and classified to reflect their relative guard-cell specific gus staining. a representative example of each category is provided in figure 3c.

we initially tested the role of the single w-box cis-element, by replacing the consensus sequence ttgac, with the non-functional ttgaa motif  <cit> . lines carrying the mutated w-box  showed similar levels of gus expression to the wild-type promoter, indicating that w-box does not contribute to mediate gene expression in guard cells . next, we produced mutant promoters in which single dof motifs within the aaag cluster were converted to the unrelated cgcga sequence. inactivation of the most distal aaaag site relative to the atg  resulted in a dramatic decrease of gus expression . 30% of the lines carrying the mdof1::gus construct did not show gus expression, whereas the remaining 70% only showed weak staining, thus indicating a crucial role for dof <dig> in regulating atmyb <dig> expression in guard cells . mutations of the second, third or fourth most proximal aaaag site , resulted in a reduced gus expression, although to a lesser extent than the one in the dof <dig> . in particular, none of the  <dig> mdof2::gus transgenic lines displayed strong expression of the reporter, nearly 70% showed intermediate expression, 25% showed weak expression and the remaining 5% did not show any gus staining . a comparable distribution among strong, intermediate and weak lines was obtained from the analysis of the mdof3::gus and mdof4::gus plants .

to establish whether dof-binding sites could exert additive roles in mediating gene expression in stomata we produced a second series of promoters, in which two aaaag motifs were mutated simultaneously. mutations of dof <dig> and dof <dig> ::gus), dof <dig> and dof <dig> ::gus) or dof <dig> and dof <dig> ::gus) completely inactivated the minimal promoter, as gus expression was abolished in all the mdof::gus, mdof::gus and mdof::gus lines analysed . interestingly, the concurrent mutation of dof <dig> and dof <dig> ::gus) resulted in a strong, but yet not complete, inactivation of the promoter activity in guard cells, as 15% of the mdof::gus lines displayed weak expression of the reporter in stomata. likewise, concomitant inactivation of either dof <dig> and dof <dig>  or dof <dig> and dof <dig> did not completely eliminate gus expression in guard cell . taken together, these results indicate that the putative aaag dof-binding sites located in the atmyb <dig> promoter are necessary to mediate its expression in guard cells.

a single dof cluster is sufficient to drive low expression in guard cell
our deletion analysis of the atmyb <dig> promoter indicates that the  <dig> bp region between positions - <dig> and - <dig> is essential for gene expression in stomatal guard cells . this region contains the dof <dig> cis-element required for guard cell expression as shown by mutagenesis analysis results . to establish whether this  <dig> bp region was sufficient to activate expression in guard cells, we fused one , two  and four tandem copies  of the  <dig> bp fragment to the minimal camv35s promoter  <cit>  upstream of the gus reporter gene , effectively reconstructing an artificial dof cluster containing one, two or four copies of the dof <dig> element. however, we did not observe gus activity in any of the  <dig> independent stable transformants produced for each construct, even after prolonged staining . these data were confirmed by qrt-pcr analysis of independent lines carrying the 4x::gus fusion , indicating that the multimerisation of the dof <dig> site per se is not sufficient to drive gene expression in guard cell. this might derive from an inappropriate organization and/or spatial distribution of the different dof elements in the context of the minimal promoter. to test this hypothesis we made two 3' deletions of the atmyb <dig> minimal promoter: the -148-3'::gus and -137-3'::gus constructs containing the first three and four dof-binding sites respectively of the most proximal cluster fused upstream of the minimal camv35s promoter . our initial histochemical analysis did not reveal any gus positive lines . to substantiate this result we also performed a qrt-pcr analysis on fifteen independent lines for each construct. interestingly, eight lines out of fifteen showed a low but significant gus transcript accumulation compared to the full length minimal promoter . these results suggest that the presence of the cluster containing three or four dof-binding sites is sufficient to drive gus activity in guard cells, even though at a very low level. this finding implies that other cis-elements present downstream of position - <dig> are required for the full functionality of the minimal promoter.

the guard cell-related cdf <dig>  cdf <dig>  cdf <dig> and cdf <dig> dof-type transcription factors do not regulate atmyb <dig> expression in stomata
target mutagenesis experiments of the atmyb <dig> promoter demonstrated that aaag dna consensus motifs are essential cis-acting elements in the regulation of atmyb <dig> expression in guard cells. consequently, their cognate dof proteins represent the most likely candidates as trans-acting factors. as the arabidopsis genome contains  <dig> dof-coding genes  <cit> , candidate dof transcription factors involved in the regulation of atmyb <dig> expression should fulfil two criteria: they should be expressed in guard cells and the loss of their gene function should abolish or significantly down-regulate the expression of atmyb <dig> in this cell type.

the cycling dof factor  <dig>  gene, involved in the regulation of photoperiodic flowering, has been shown to be highly expressed in the vascular tissue and guard cells  <cit> . we thus investigated the expression of the atmyb <dig> gene in the loss-of-function cdf1-r allele. as shown in additional file  <dig> we did not detect significant differences in the accumulation of atmyb <dig> transcripts in homozygous cdf1-r plants compared with the wild type.

it is important to note that in photoperiodic flowering, cdf <dig> acts redundantly with three other dof proteins, namely cdf <dig> , cdf <dig>  and cdf <dig>   <cit> , belonging to the same phylogenetic group ii  <cit> . similarly to cdf <dig>  promoter::gus analyses revealed that cdf <dig>  cdf <dig> and cdf <dig> are strongly expressed in guard cells.

we thus analysed the expression of atmyb <dig> in single, double, triple and quadruple cdf mutants to determine the possible role of these additional candidate cdf proteins. as for cdf1-r mutant, the level of expression of atmyb <dig> was not significantly reduced in the cdf2- <dig>  cdf3- <dig> and cdf5- <dig> single mutants . likewise, atmyb <dig> expression was not altered in any of the double, triple or quadruple mutant combinations, indicating that, despite their expression in guard cells, these four cdf proteins are not trans-regulators of atmyb <dig> expression in stomata .

identification of a promoter region that negatively responds to aba
we previously reported that transcript accumulation of the atmyb <dig> gene is rapidly down-regulated by exogenous applications of the hormone aba, which plays a fundamental role in regulating gene expression in response to drought stress  <cit> . to identify the promoter region responsible for the aba-mediated atmyb <dig> down-regulation, we applied aba to the previously described transgenic lines harbouring serial deletions of the atmyb <dig> promoter . quantitative rt-pcr analysis revealed a similar decrease in gus transcript levels in transgenic lines carrying the full length as well as the - <dig>  - <dig> and -366::gus fusions . the kinetic of down-regulation of the gus transcript was comparable to the one observed for the endogenous gene atmyb <dig>  <cit> , indicating that - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> promoters maintain the sequences responsible for transcriptional down-regulation by aba. also, these results suggest that the caagttg motif, present in the atmyb <dig> promoter between - <dig> and - <dig> , and recently described as overrepresented in aba-repressed genes  <cit> , does not play a significant role in the aba-dependent repression of atmyb <dig> expression. rather, qrt-pcr experiments performed on different independent lines carrying the -246::gus construct showed that the minimal promoter sequence lacks the region responsible for negative regulation by aba, as these lines did not show changes in gus expression in response to the hormone as shown in figure  <dig> 

taken together these data indicate that, although the minimal promoter maintains the cis-elements necessary for guard cell expression, it lacks the motifs that mediate the negative regulation by aba, becoming aba-insensitive. we can thus conclude that the region between - <dig> and - <dig> contains elements necessary for aba down-regulation.

discussion
very few guard cell-specific promoters have been described to date  <cit> . independent studies demonstrated that the atmyb <dig> promoter can be considered guard cell-specific, being sufficient to drive expression of reporter genes specifically in guard cells  <cit> . moreover this promoter has also been used to complement a mutant phenotype specifically in guard cells  <cit> , and to investigate subcellular localization exclusively in guard cells  <cit> . in this study we identified the atmyb <dig> minimal promoter that is necessary and sufficient to drive guard cell-specific expression.

dof-binding sites are required for atmyb <dig> guard-cells expression
our in silico analysis identified three dof site clusters . initial deletion studies revealed a prominent role for the most proximal dof cluster . site-directed mutagenesis showed that the distal most dof-binding site  plays a major role in driving guard cell expression compared to other dof motifs of the same cluster . these other dof elements play partially additive roles, as clearly demonstrated by the combined mutagenesis of these sites and dof <dig> site which resulted in a drastically reduced gus activity . dof-binding sites are thus key determinants in mediating guard cell expression, in accordance with the dof cluster hypothesis we previously formulated  <cit> . a suggestion for a similar involvement of dof cis-elements in arabidopsis derives from the work of gardner and colleagues  that identified dof motifs in a region controlling guard cell expression. other authors identified a region enriched in dof-binding sites in the guard cell-specific pgc <dig> promoter, although the mutation of a single dof site did not impair promoter activity  <cit> . interestingly, a dof cluster organization is present in the promoter of the grape vvmyb <dig> gene, a putative ortholog of atmyb <dig>  indicating a conservation of the cluster structure during the evolution among atmyb <dig> orthologs  <cit> . the results reported by plesch and colleagues  on the dof motif organisation in the potato kst <dig> promoter highlight a more general evolutionary conservation of this module in the control of guard cell-specific activity of promoters.

although we cannot rule out the possibility that other unknown transcription factors might interact with those same cis-elements, dof factors represent likely candidates as atmyb <dig> regulators. the most parsimonious hypothesis resulting from combining our results indicates that dof proteins act as positive regulators of atmyb <dig>  the potato stdof <dig> protein has been shown to bind in vitro to the guard cell specific promoter of kst <dig>  <cit> , while no data are available for any arabidopsis dof proteins. among the arabidopsis dof genes, cdf <dig>  cdf <dig>  cdf <dig>  and cdf <dig>  are expressed in guard cells  <cit> . however, singles and multiple cdf mutants show a wild-type pattern of atmyb <dig> expression, ruling out their involvement in atmyb <dig> regulation . the majority of arabidopsis dof genes are expressed in guard cells  <cit>  and may thus act redundantly, as already demonstrated among members of this family  <cit> . all these aspects do not facilitate the identification of obvious candidates as atmyb <dig> regulators. we are trying to identify the dof genes involved in the regulation of atmyb <dig> by analysis of its expression in mutants of genes preferentially expressed in the guard cells .

multiple cis-elements participate to enhance atmyb <dig> guard-cells expression
transcriptional gus fusions, harbouring different deletions of the 5' intergenic region to position - <dig> from the atg, conferred gus activity exclusively in guard cells . the activity of these promoter regions is in apparent discrepancy with the detection of atmyb <dig> gene expression in seeds, as revealed by available microarray analysis data  <cit>  and in roots, as recently reported  <cit> . one hypothesis to explain this incongruity could be the presence of other regulatory regions present outside the complete 5' and 3' intergenic regions flanking the atmyb <dig> coding sequence. intron sequences, for example, may be involved in such a regulation, as previously demonstrated for different plant genes .

while guard-cell specific expression was invariably maintained by functional atmyb <dig> promoter variants, the levels of expression varied considerably. in addition to dof-binding sites, other cis-elements are required to boost the atmyb <dig> expression. indeed, an artificial dof <dig> binding site repeated in single or multiple copies could not drive guard cell expression . the incorporation of the entire proximal dof cluster  resulted in a small but significant guard cell transcriptional activity. thus, other cis-elements downstream of position - <dig> are required for full activity of the minimal promoter. it is known that cis-elements other than dof-binding sites are involved in the regulation of guard cell expression. in the case of the guard cell-specific atpdr <dig> gene no aaag clusters were identified in a 1000-bp region upstream of the atg codon, suggesting the presence of other regulatory units  <cit> .

modular organization of the atmyb <dig> promoter
in this study we also investigated the regulation of the atmyb <dig> promoter activity in response to aba. aba treatments induce global changes in gene expression in arabidopsis  <cit> . transcriptomic analyses revealed extensive regulation of gene expression by aba also in guard cells  <cit> . while cis-elements that positively regulate the response to aba have been functionally characterised , those that negatively regulate the response to aba are largely unknown. a caattg motif has been shown to be over-represented in aba-repressed gene promoters and thus proposed for such a role  <cit> . the atmyb <dig> promoter contains one caagttg motif between - <dig> and - <dig> from the atg, yet our results do not support its proposed role as negative regulator of aba response. conversely, a region between positions - <dig> to - <dig> contained the entire requirement for the aba-mediated repression figures  <dig> and  <dig>  it has been proposed that evolution may have favoured the differentiation of mechanisms for aba down-regulation rather than up-regulation, rendering more difficult for any aba-repression motif to achieve statistical significance  <cit> . our data may provide a valuable model system to clarify the mechanism mediating aba repression.

our data suggests a modular organization for the atmyb <dig> promoter as summarised in figure  <dig>  through a serial deletion analysis, we defined the atmyb <dig> minimal promoter, sufficient to induce guard cell-specific activity . a  <dig> bp region, located between position - <dig> and position - <dig>  is necessary to confer gus activity in guard cells . we also identified two regions that enhance the expression of the gus gene between - <dig> bp and - <dig> bp and between - <dig> and - <dig> . besides providing pieces of evidence for such modular organization, our work indicates that the different portions of the atmyb <dig> promoter may prove useful for manipulating gene expression in guard cells, with the possibility to obtain different level of expression. moreover, the minimal promoter  can be used for aba-independent expression of target genes in guard cells

interestingly, both the full length and the minimal promoters maintain their guard cell-specific activity in heterologous systems, such as the crop species tomato and tobacco , thus indicating the conservation of this cell-specific regulatory mechanism among different plant species. moreover, preliminary results suggest that the atmyb <dig> minimal promoter can be combined with other cis-regulatory modules to produce functional guard cell-specific chimeric promoters . as a whole our data demonstrate that both the full length and the minimal atmyb <dig> promoters provide a valuable tool to manipulate gene expression specifically in guard cells, both for physiological studies and downstream biotechnological applications.

CONCLUSIONS
our work provides strong evidence for the involvement of aaag elements in the regulation of the atmyb <dig> expression, illustrating their functional cluster organization. future work will concentrate on the analysis of candidate dof transcription factors that control this mechanism. finally we identify a region of the atmyb <dig> promoter required for the negative regulation by aba, offering the possibility to discover novel cis-elements for this kind of regulation.
