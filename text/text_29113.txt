BACKGROUND
micrornas  are one family of small , non-coding rnas. they regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally through binding to the complementary sites of target mrnas in the 3’utr  <cit> , and play an important role in regulating diverse biological processes, such as stem cell maintenance, development, metabolism, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis  <cit> . cumulative evidence indicates that some mirnas act as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors in the tumorigenesis of crc and possess the tumor marker potential for diagnostic, therapeutic, prognostic exploration  <cit> . to elucidate the mechanism of mirna regulation, it is critical to discover the differentially expressed mirna and identify the target mrnas of mirnas.

many aberrant expressed mirnas were found in crc tissues by mirna microarray assay  <cit> . the target relationship between particular mirna and mrna were identified by in-vitro experiments such as transfection and luciferase activity assays  <cit> . although in-vitro experiments provide invaluable information on mirna regulation, those experiments are not possible to be applied to clinical samples, and it is also impossible to obtain results under a genome-wide circumstance. many databases were explored to predict the targets of mirnas by either seed sequence complementary or thermodynamic algorithm  <cit> , however these databases only provide the possibility of predicting direct target-relationship mirna-mrna pairs and can not predict disease-specific pairs in a specific disease.

mirnas regulate target gene expression in two ways, mrna degradation or translation inhibition  <cit> . the target genes which were regulated by mirnas through mrna degradation are negatively correlated with the mirna regulators. therefore an approach for the identification of mirna-mrna regulatory modules was introduced by constructing the paired mirna-mrna expression profiles and predicting the putative target genes of mirnas  <cit> . however, this novel multi-step approach has not been tested in crc, especially in clinical matched tumor/normal mucosa samples.

in this study, we applied the multi-step approach by constructing the aberrant paired mirna-mrna expression profiles and the clusters of mirna target genes to investigate the role of mirna in crc.

RESULTS
strategy
as shown in figure  <dig>  a multi-step approach was adopted to identify the mrna targets of crc-specific mirnas in colorectal cancer. first, in the same cohort of eight cases of pathologically confirmed crc and their corresponding adjacent normal tissues, the significantly aberrant expression profiles of both mirna and mrna were obtained by microarray test. second, the significant anti-correlation between mirna-mrna pairs was determined based on the expression level of each aberrantly expressed mirna and each aberrantly expressed mrna. third, only the target-relationship mirna-mrna pairs, which were also predicted by both targetscanhuman v <dig>   <cit>  and miranda  <cit> , were retained. fourth, some of the predicted direct target-relationship mirna-mrna pairs were selected to be validated in an extended cohort of crc tissues by qrt-pcr detection.

further in detailed explanation, the target genes of dysregulated mirna in crc tissues should meet the following requirements: 1)the micrornas and mrnas were differentially expressed between crc tissues and corresponding normal samples 2) the expression level of mirnas and mrnas were significantly anti-correlated  3) the mrna is a putative target of mirna predicted by both targetscan  <cit>  and miranda  <cit> .

mirna and mrna aberrant expression profiles in crc samples
the mirna expression profiles in  <dig> crc tissues and their corresponding adjacent normal tissues were determined using mirna microarray analysis. histologically, the  <dig> crc cases were all moderately differentiated, non-mucinous adeno-carcinoma, micro-satellite stable. the clinical data of the  <dig> crc cases are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  after between-array normalization and filtering on flags  carried out by rma algorithm  <cit> ,  <dig> mirnas were selected for further analysis. using student’s t-test and significant analysis of microarray analyses   <cit>  ,  <dig> mirnas were found to be significantly differentially expressed between crc tissues and their corresponding adjacent normal tissues, including  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated which were shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  in addition, the aberrantly different mirna expression levels were illustrated by heatmap in figure  <dig> 

the mrna expression profiles of the same  <dig> paired-samples in mirna expression profiling were analyzed by whole human genome agilent 4 × 44 k oligonucleotide microarray . after between-array normalization performed by linear models for microarray data   <cit> ,  <dig> genes were identified as significantly differentially expressed in crc tissues using the criteria similar to that in mirna microarray assays  and was included in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

the microarray data was deposited to the ncbi gene expression omnibus 

identifying target genes by anti-correlation and target prediction
pearson’s correlation analysis was applied to the  <dig> significantly differentially expressed mirnas and significantly differentially expressed  <dig> mrnas. since mirnas act as negative regulators, up-regulated mirnas resulted in down-regulated target mrnas, and vice versa. a total of  <dig> mirna-mrna pairs  were obtained by two criteria: pearson’s correlation less than - <dig>  was considered as anti-correlation and a p-value less than  <dig>  as statistically significant. a multiple-hypothesis correction was carried out by benjamini-horchberg algorithm. the fdr value of all the  <dig> mirna-mrna pairs were less than  <dig>  and were selected for further analysis. to predict the target mrnas for the  <dig> dysregulated mirnas, targetscanhuman  and miranda database were used. to eliminate false positive rates of the target prediction databases, only the mirna-mrna pairs simultaneously predicted by both targetscanhuman v <dig>  and miranda were considered as target relationship mirna-mrna pairs in our study. seventy-two mirna-mrna pairs combined by  <dig> dysregulated mirnas and their  <dig> target mrnas were predicted by those two prediction databases and simultaneously presented an anti-correlationship between the expression level of mirnas and mrnas. these  <dig> predicted target mrnas included many genes previously reported to be involved in tumorigenesis of crc or other malignant tumors such as klf <dig>  <cit> , sfrp <dig>  <cit> , sfrp <dig>  <cit> , rnf <dig>  <cit> . these  <dig> predicted mirna-mrna pairs contained  <dig> up-regulated mirnas targeting  <dig> down-regulated mrna  and  <dig> down-regulated mirnas targeting  <dig> up-regulated mrnas . the expression levels of  <dig> target mrnas were illustrated by heatmap .

pathway analysis of the mirna targets
to obtain a better understanding of biological function of mirnas dysregulated in crc, function analysis of the mirna target genes was carried out by database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery  v <dig>   <cit> . as a result of finding which biological processes of go or pathway from the kegg database were significantly enriched,  <dig> go categories were found enriched with a p-value <  <dig>  , however using a cutoff of fdr <  <dig> , no go category were found significantly enriched. using a cutoff of fdr <  <dig> , the wnt signaling pathway  was the only significantly enriched kegg pathway .

validation of the expression level of mirna and mrna in an extended cohort of crc tissues by qrt-pcr
to validate the reliability of the microarray test, <dig> up-regulated mirnas  and their  <dig> down-regulated target mrnas  were selected for qrt-pcr examination in  <dig> matched crc/normal mucosa tissues whose clinical data were listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the rationale for selecting these up-regulated mirnas and down-regulated mrnas was the down-regulated expression of sfrp <dig>  <cit> , sfrp <dig>  <cit> , and rnf <dig>  <cit>  were reported to be involved in the activity of the wnt receptor signaling pathway. further it was found that the expression of klf <dig>  <cit>  was down-regulated in crc tissues compared with normal mucosa.

as demonstrated in figure 3a, the five mirnas  were significantly up-regulated in crc tissues, except for mir-27a due to non-efficient amplification . as shown in figure 3b, the expression levels of the  <dig> mrnas were significantly down-regulated in crc tissues.

additionally, the pearson’s correlation coefficient between the expression levels of mirna-mrna pairs were calculated, and two identified mirna-mrna pairs, mir- <dig> and sfrp <dig>  mir-29a and klf <dig> were found significantly anti-correlated in qrt-pcr tests. however,  <dig> mirna-mrna pairs  not predicted by the two exist between mirnas and sfrp <dig> .

in vitro analysis revealed expression of klf <dig> is regulated by mir-29a
to further validate identified mirna-mrna interactions, the transfection assay was carried out to demonstrate the relationship between mir-29a and its identified target, klf <dig>  hct- <dig> cells were transfected with mir-29a mimics and mir-29a inhibitor. the qrt-pcr and western-blot revealed that the klf <dig> mrna and protein expression were significantly down-regulated by the mir-29a mimics  while the klf <dig> expression levels were significantly up-regulated by mir-29a inhibitor , compared with the control group and mock group. these data indicated that the klf <dig> mrna and protein expression levels are controlled by mir-29a, suggesting that klf <dig> probably was the target of mir-29a.

discussion
mirnas, acting as negative regulators of gene expression, regulate various biological processes via inhibiting the expression of their target genes. increasing evidence shows that some mirnas play critical roles in tumorigenesis of crc and have a potential clinical value in diagnosis, treatment and prognosis evaluation for crc  <cit> . it is of great importance to identify the targets of mirnas and elucidate their complex regulatory networks.

in this study, a multi-step approach to identify the mrna targets of dysregulated mirnas in crc was adopted. firstly, in the same cohort of samples containing crc tissues and their corresponding adjacent tissues, the expression profiles of mirnas and mrnas were screened. secondly, all possible pairs of mirna-mrna with an anti-correlationship were identified by pearson’s correlation analysis, implying that these pairs of mirna-mrna may contain both the direct target-relationship and indirect anti-correlationship pairs. thirdly, the reliability of the identified target-relationship pairs of mirnas-mrnas was assessed and confirmed by using both targetscan and miranda databases. finally, the differential expression and their anti-correlationship of  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> mrnas were validated by qrt-pcr and the regulatory effect of mir-29a on the expression of target of klf <dig> mrna was validated by in-vitro analysis. through the multi-step approach,  <dig> mirna-mrna pairs containing  <dig> dysregulated mirnas and their  <dig> target mrnas in crc were identified, and the wnt signaling pathway was the only affected pathway based on pathway analysis for the mirna targets.

compared with previous studies on the mirna expression profile of crc, including mirna microarray  <cit> , mirna cloning and sage  <cit> , most dysregualted mirnas detected in this study were consistent with at least one of the previous studies. however, some discrepancy and inconsistency of the mirna expression profile between studies were found. for instance, the elevated expression of mir-29b in crc tissues in this study and the recent report  <cit>  contradicted findings in cummins’ report  <cit>  and the elevated expression of mir- <dig> in crc tissues in this study was in consistent with the other two studies based on chinese patients’ samples <cit> . however, no other studies reported the altered expression level of mir- <dig> in crc. the discrepancy of mirna expression profile between studies might be attributed to the sample size, genetic background, clinical characteristics or different technique platforms. strikingly, it was found that mir- <dig>  an up-regulated mirna with high fold -change in this study  was not reported as a dysregulated mirna in crc in previous studies. in studies with other tumors, an elevated expression level of mir- <dig> was an indicator of poor disease-free survival in non-small cell lung carcinoma  <cit> , and correlated with a larger size of tumor and poor tumor grade in breast cancer tissues  <cit>  while some reports stated that mir- <dig> inhibits egfr and the akt pathway, and the expression level of mir- <dig> was down-regulated expression in gilobastoma  <cit> . it seems that the role of mir- <dig> differs in various types of cancer, suggesting that the expression and function of mirnas is tissue cell specific. the expression level of mir- <dig> and its potential targets in crc are worthwhile for further investigation

in this study, an important note should be added that a very strict criterion was adopted to identify the mirna targets. briefly, the target mrna should be differentially expressed, significantly anti-correlated with its mirna regulator, and predicted by two databases, targetscan and miranda. based on this strict criterion,our final identified mirna-mrna pairs have a high probability of involvement in crc tumorigenesis. the following analysis will support this high probability. on one hand, comparing the mrna targets  of the dysregualted mirnas  predicted just by targetscan, only a small portion of the target genes  were significantly differentially expressed in crc, and were selected for further analysis, while a great number of mrnas  were not differentially expressed in crc tissue, and were not selected for further analysis. the fact that these  <dig> genes were predicted as mirnas targets but not significantly differentially expressed, suggested that the expression of these  <dig> mrnas might not be regulated by the  <dig> dysregulated mirnas, but by other mechanisms such as regulation by other mirna, methylation, cis-regulatory elements, etc. which may act and counteract the regulation of mirna. on the other hand, pearson’s correlation analysis selected  <dig> mirna-mrna pairs whose expression levels were significantly inversely correlated, however only  <dig> target relationships of mirna were finally identified. the existence of the rest of  <dig> mirna-mrna pairs may be caused by the indirect regulation.

another interesting finding was that the expression values of mir-29a showed a narrower range of change than those of its predicted target, klf <dig>  to rationalize this finding, it is hypothesized that the klf <dig> mrna expression was regulated by many other factors including other mirnas. besides mir-29a, klf <dig> was also identified as a target gene of mir- <dig>  an up-regulated mirna with high fold-change. the unparalleled change of mirna and its target mrna expression levels could be caused by the two mirna  targeting one gene . inspired by this finding, the relationship between fold-change of mrnas expression and the number of corresponding mirna regulators were further analyzed. in the identified  <dig> mirna-mrna pairs, three groups can be classified: 1)  <dig> mrnas were regulated by  <dig> mirnas, 2) <dig> mrnas were regulated by  <dig> mirnas, and 3) the rest  were regulated by  <dig> mirna. however, the fold-changes of the gene mrna expression between these three groups do not reach the statistical significance, indicating the gene expression regulation is very complex and dynamic with impact from multi-factors.

mirnas regulate diverse biological processes via regulating the expression of target genes. in this study, only the wnt signaling pathway, which had been proved to be aberrantly activated in crc  <cit> , was found to be affected through pathway analysis of the mirna targets. our study revealed that  <dig> down-regulated mrna and an up-regulated mirna regulated by  <dig> dysregulated mirna in crc respectively were involved in the wnt signaling pathway, and shed light on the mirna regulation of wnt signaling pathway.

nevertheless, the orchestration of these regulatory pairs of mirna-mrna differed in different diseases, presenting the disease-specific expression profiles and composing a complex regulatory network. although many methods had been used to identify the regulatory pairs of mirna-mrna in diseases such as microarray and software-prediction, no method possessed the capacity to determine all mirna-mrna regulatory pairs. moreover, since the anti-correlationship of the mirnas-mrna expression levels was used as the screening criteria, only those target genes regulated through mrna degradation could be identified here, target genes regulated by mirnas through translation inhibition would be lost.

in summary, these new findings of pairs of mirna-mrna provide some hints for the mechanisms of crc tumorigenesis and were worthwhile for further functional analysis. the more complex regulatory networks call for more research in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
based on this research, seventy-two mirna-mrna pairs combined by  <dig> dysregulated mirnas and their  <dig> target mrnas identified by the multi-step approach appear to be involved in crc tumorigenesis. the identified mirna-mrna pairs are worthwhile for further functional studies.
