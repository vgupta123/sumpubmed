BACKGROUND
ion-osmoregulation is vital for the maintenance of tissue and cellular functions. it is important not only to define intracellular osmolality and cell shape, but it is also crucial for guiding many cellular functions, including transepithelial transport, cellular metabolism, and cell migration  <cit> . the fundamental mechanism of the regulation is highly conserved in metazoan; however, plasticity and efficiency of the regulation may vary with respect to the evolutionary development of animals during adaptation. aquatic organisms are known to have well-developed osmoregulatory apparatus to regulate fluid and ion transport when faced with changes in water osmolality and to maintain a constant body osmolality. in euryhaline fish , those that are naturally exposed to waters of varying salinity during their life cycles, maintaining a constant plasma osmolality when faced with an osmotic challenge has become a habitual and normal process. the gills of euryhaline fish are recognized as highly efficient ion-osmoregulatory apparatus evolved to adapt to large changes in external osmolality. therefore, it is an excellent tissue model to reveal the fundamental mechanism associated with plasticity in ion-osmoregulatory processes.

there are two major types of gill cells, the pavement cells  and the mitochondria-rich cells , which play key roles in ion-osmoregulation, namely sodium , chloride , and calcium  transport, and acid–base balance. early studies using electron microscopic analysis reported remodeling of gill tissues and identified changes in the relative abundance of pvcs and mrcs in fish acclimated to waters of different salinities  <cit> . electrophysiological studies using an alternate inner opercular membrane tissue model have indirectly demonstrated the ion transport functions of gill cells  <cit> . later studies, using both histochemical and nucleic acid analyses, showed the spatiotemporal expression of different ion transporters in pvcs and mrcs of fish acclimated to freshwater  or seawater  environments, with the aim of delineating possible functions  <cit> . the techniques of subtractive hybridization, microarray, and rapid amplification of cdna ends  have been applied to reveal differential gene expressions in gill tissues collected from fw- or sw-adapted fish . however, the significance of the studies was hindered by the limitation in identifying new transcripts with low sequence similarities to the existing sequence databases. nonetheless, different working models to describe the ion transport activities of the two cell types have been proposed and described in recent review papers  <cit> . basically, the growth and differentiation of gill pvcs and mrcs were found to respond differently in fw and sw environments and the cells played different but complementary roles in ion transport . findings during the past decades have provided unequivocal evidence strengthening our understanding of the fundamental mechanism of the cells in ion-osmoregulation; however, the scope of the studies has largely been limited by the availability of molecular tools  in the fish species. therefore, advancement of the understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanisms undertaken in the two cell types has been challenging. knowledge gaps in differential responses of pvcs and mrcs to osmotic stress have been identified. in this study, we hypothesized that pvcs and mrcs adopt different molecular mechanisms against an osmotic challenge to gain functional plasticity with respect to their roles and anatomical localizations. we aimed to conduct transcriptomic analysis of isolated pvcs and mrcs from both fw- and sw-adapted eels, followed by bioinformatics analysis and data verification, to decipher the molecular processes undertaken in these two type of cells.

RESULTS
ion-osmoregulation is one of the key physiological processes essential for the maintenance of a consistent internal environment. euryhaline fish are known to be an important model in the investigation of this fundamental and evolutionarily conserved process. in  <dig>  the first draft genome sequence of the japanese eel was reported, in which a total assembled genome size was  <dig>  gbp and an n <dig> of  <dig>  bp was produced using the illumina platform  <cit> . moreover, transcriptomic analysis of juvenile european eels or specific body tissues  of japanese eels were published using the roche  <dig> or illumina miseq platform . in the gill transcriptome of the japanese eel,  <dig>  transcripts were identified in fish adapted to fw or sw conditions  <cit> . in a recent study using tilapia  as the model fish with the  <dig> platform, more than  <dig>  annotated gill transcripts were reported  <cit> . the transcriptomic analysis of fish gills summarized differential expressed genes in both hypo- and hyper-osmoregulation. however, the molecular responses in the gill pvcs and mrcs in relation to their functional phenotypes are still unknown.

in this study, we conducted transcriptomic analysis to identify differential gene expression profiles in gill pvcs and mrcs from japanese eels adapted to fw or sw conditions. to move beyond previous transcriptomic analyses of fish gills, we used our established gill cell isolation protocol, a discontinuous percoll gradient centrifugation, to enrich the two cell types, with cell purity greater than 85 %  <cit> . the method was validated by other research groups and applied for functional characterization of the individual cell types in other fish models  <cit> . furthermore, flow cytometry and electronic microscopy characterizing the two types of cells had been performed in our group to confirm the fraction specificity  <cit> . after rna sequencing of the isolated cell types, we profiled and compared the expression levels of transcripts derived from the four groups of samples,  fw pvcs,  sw pvcs,  fw mrcs, and  sw mrcs, using the database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery  and ingenuity pathway analysis  bioinformatics analysis. the general workflow is shown in fig.  <dig>  the results, presented here for the first time, demonstrated the genome-wide molecular regulatory networks undertaken in gill pvcs and mrcs in response to osmotic challenges.fig.  <dig> workflow of illumina deep sequencing and bioinformatics analyses. it includes sample preparation, cdna library construction, illumina sequencing, and data analyses including transcriptome assembly, blast search, go annotation, ipa analysis, and gene expression analysis



the transcriptome of gill pvcs and mrcs generated by the mi-seq platform
sequencing libraries were prepared by enriched populations of pvcs and mrcs in both fw and sw conditions. using the illumina miseq platform,  <dig>  m reads per sample, with a total of  <dig>  gb throughput, were obtained. among  <dig>  assembled contigs, a total of  <dig>  transcripts were identified in reference to the uniprotkb/swiss-prot database . the distribution of contig-length ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp and the average contig-length was 783 bp. the n <dig>  n <dig>  and n <dig> were  <dig>  kb,  <dig>  kb, and  <dig>  kb, respectively . regarding the taxonomic distribution of the identified  <dig>  genes,  <dig>  % of the genes showed the highest similarities to lepisosteus oculatus, followed by oncorhynchus mykiss  and danio rerio  . the low percentage of the matched genes from anguilla species  is due to the lack of qualified genome databases and limited protein sequences of the fish species deposited in the uniprot database  <cit> .fig.  <dig> summary of the de novo assembly of the eel gill pvcs and mrcs transcriptome. a distribution of the assembled contigs with different contig length . included are contig lengths for n- <dig>  n- <dig>  and n- <dig>  b species distribution of matched genes, with the highest similarity to lepisosteus oculatus




in comparing the cell-type specific  transcriptome data with our previous published whole-gill transcriptome  <cit> ,  <dig>  transcripts were found to be commonly annotated . nine hundred eighty-three newly annotated transcripts were first identified in this study. we matched our data to the national center for biotechnology information  database, in which  <dig> anguilla japonica transcripts with complete coding sequences were available. in blastn, we found that  <dig>  deposited sequences matched our unified pvc/mrc transcript data. among those,  <dig> of  <dig> sequences showed excellent hits with e-values equal to zero, while another  <dig> sequences had e-values less than 1e- <dig> . the coverage of the sequence lengths is shown in fig. 3b. the data showed that the majority of the assembled sequences exhibited excellent hits , and most of them were covered by at least 75 % mrna sequence with respect to the full-length transcript deposited in the ncbi database.fig.  <dig> evaluation of eel gill cell transcriptome. a percentage distribution  of the  <dig> sanger sequences with respective best hit grouped within different blastn e-value range. b percentage distribution  of the  <dig> sanger sequence with different full-length sizes  grouped within different blastn e-value range



in fig.  <dig>  a venn diagram shows the relations among the four pvc and mrc datasets. in pvcs, there were  <dig>  transcripts expressed in both fw and sw conditions. while in mrcs,  <dig>  transcripts were commonly expressed in both conditions. three differential expressed genes, two isoforms of carbonic anhydrase  and one chloride channel  commonly expressed in both pvcs and mrcs were chosen for validation. the results of the quantitative polymerase chain reaction  analysis supported the transcriptome data in which fw pvcs and fw mrcs showed greater expression levels of clcn <dig> and cah <dig>  but lower expression levels of cah <dig> compared to the corresponding sw samples . clcn <dig>  a chloride channel, belongs to the clc family of chloride channel/transport proteins. in humans, clcn <dig> has been suggested to function in the chloride efflux pathway  <cit>  and its mutation is linked to a central nervous system disorder  <cit> . while in zebrafish, clcn <dig> is suggested to take part in chloride uptake with the apical sodium chloride cotransporter 2b expressing cells, and highly expressed in the mrcs  <cit> . the greater expression of clcn <dig> in fw gill cells might play a role in cl− transport. the two other validated transcripts, cah <dig> and cah <dig>  are protein products known to catalyze the inter-conversion of carbon dioxide and water to bicarbonate and protons. ca is recognized to play important roles in gaseous exchanges and the acid–base balance, cooperating with other transporters such as sodium hydrogen exchangers  in gills of both fw and sw teleost fish . besides, studies have showed that clcn <dig> was highly expressed in mrcs than pvcs in zebrafish  <cit> . however, no significant difference was found in the eel gill cells, which may due to the species differences. nevertheless, we have identified the two ca isoforms differentially expressed in fw and sw environments in this study. the importance of the two isoforms in gaseous exchange and acid–base balance or other functions in fw and sw conditions warrants further investigation .fig.  <dig> comparison of annotated genes in fw pvcs, fw mrcs, sw pvcs, and sw mrcs in eel gills. of the identified genes,  <dig>  transcripts were expressed in pvcs, while  <dig>  transcripts were expressed in mrcs

differential expressed genes in pvcs in fw and sw conditions
to analyze changes in molecular responses in individual cell types, the datasets were processed by comparing the transcriptome of each cell type in fw and sw conditions. bioinformatics analyses using david and ipa were implemented.

in comparing the transcriptome data of pvcs in fw and sw conditions,  <dig> degs were found. among those,  <dig> transcripts were up-regulated and  <dig> transcripts were down-regulated in fw pvcs as compared to sw pvcs . the highly expressed transcripts detected in fw pvcs were subjected to gene ontology  analysis. the top three categories in the biological process , including  intracellular signaling cascade ,  immune response , and  regulation of cell proliferation , were prioritized. for the cellular component , the top three enriched categories were  plasma membrane ,  plasma membrane part , and  cytoplasmic vesicle . for the molecular function , the top three categories were  transcription regulator activity ,  transcription factor activity , and  sequence-specific dna binding  . a go analysis was also conducted using the transcripts that were highly expressed in sw pvcs as compared to fw pvcs. noticeably, more go terms were established in the sw pvcs , suggesting that the additional enriched gene transcripts participated in specific acclimated functions in the sw environment. in the bp, the top three categories were  intracellular signaling cascade ,  phosphate metabolic process/phosphorus metabolic process , and  regulation of cell proliferation/cell adhesion/biological adhesion . in the cc, the top three categories were  plasma membrane ,  extracellular region , and  plasma membrane part . in the mf,  cation binding ,  metal ion binding , and  nucleotide binding  were the top three in the list . in comparison with all  <dig> go terms between the fw and sw pvcs, there were only  <dig> common enriched go terms . interestingly, in the mf, the insulin-like growth factor  binding activity and growth factor binding activity were enriched in the sw pvcs. the two binding activities are known to be important in sw acclimation  <cit> . the go terms cytoskeletal protein binding and calcium ion binding were also enriched in the sw pvcs, suggesting that cytoskeleton reorganization and calcium ion regulation are essential in sw pvcs. cytoskeletal reorganization is known to be induced in gill cells upon a hyperosmotic challenge while an increase of ca2+ binding may facilitate ca2+ transport and reduce ca2+-induced cytotoxicity in sw environments  <cit> . moreover, in the bp, an activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase  activity was identified as an enriched go term in the sw pvcs. this is consistent with our previous studies in indicating the involvement of mapk cascade in hyperosmotic stress-elicited signaling  <cit> . lastly, numerous biosynthetic and metabolic regulatory processes were enriched in sw pvcs , supporting the previous findings of greater metabolic rates detected in gills of sw fish  <cit> .fig.  <dig> summary of the degs in fw and sw pvcs. a  <dig> transcripts expressed higher in fw and  <dig> transcripts expressed higher in sw. selected transcripts for validation are indicated. b the top three enriched go terms in fw pvcs and sw pvcs. bp appears in red; cc appears in green; mf appears in blue. bolded text indicates the unique go terms in fw and sw



differential expressed genes in mrcs in fw and sw conditions
in the mrcs,  <dig> transcripts were up-regulated and  <dig> transcripts were down-regulated in fw conditions as compared to the cells in sw conditions . in the go analysis, the top three categories under the bp in the fw mrcs were  intracellular signaling cascade ,  immune response , and  cell adhesion/biological adhesion/cell death/death . in the cc, the top three categories on the list were  plasma membrane part ,  nucleolus , and  cell junction . in the mf,  calcium ion binding ,  transcription factor binding , and  guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity/transcription coactivator activity  were the three enriched categories . while in the sw mrcs,  the regulation of cell proliferation/behavior  and  regulation of cell adhesion/positive regulation of catalytic activity/positive regulation of molecular function  were the top enriched categories in bp.  the plasma membrane ,  extracellular region , and  extracellular region part  were the highest on the list under the cc. notably no mf category was identified in the sw mrcs . collectively, the enriched go terms in fw mrcs were  <dig>  while in sw mrcs were  <dig>  all identified go terms were unique in the fw and sw conditions .fig.  <dig> summary of the degs in fw and sw mrcs. a  <dig> transcripts expressed higher in fw and  <dig> transcripts expressed higher in sw. selected transcripts for validation are indicated. b the top three enriched go terms in fw mrcs and sw mrcs. bp appears in red; cc appears in green; mf appears in blue. bolded text indicates the unique go terms in fw and sw



collectively for both cell types in fw and sw conditions, pvcs showed more degs and had six-fold more go terms than the mrcs. the data implied that a greater molecular change was required to modify the functional phenotypes of pvcs in waters of different salinities. the result is not surprising as the pvcs cover more than 90 % of the outermost layers of fish gills that are in direct contact with water  <cit> .

differential expressed genes in pvcs and mrcs in fw or sw
to provide comprehensive data for readers of this report to identify their own targets, we further compared the pvcs and mrcs in fw or sw conditions. one hundred forty-five degs were identified in fw conditions, in which  <dig> transcripts showed higher expressions in mrcs and  <dig> transcripts were highly expressed in pvcs. while in sw conditions, there were  <dig> degs in comparison between pvcs and mrcs. five hundred forty-six transcripts were highly expressed in sw mrcs, while  <dig> transcripts were expressed higher in sw pvcs . highly expressed sw pvc transcripts involved in tight junction and cytoskeleton regulation were selected and real-time pcr was performed for data validation . the results suggested that in the sw environment, pvcs actively regulate their intra- and inter-cellular architectures to compensate for the sw environment.

pvcs and mrcs showed different osmo-responsive signaling pathways against osmotic challenges
in the latter part of the analysis, ipa software was used to provide an overview of canonical pathways and cellular functions of the degs identified in pvcs or mrcs in both fw and sw conditions . the cellular locations of the degs in pvcs and mrcs were defined. our results showed that 30 % of the degs, either identified in pvcs or mrcs, were localized in “cell cytoplasm” . based on the analysis of functional types of molecules, the two major functional categories  observed in both pvcs and mrcs was “enzyme” , and “transcription regulator”  . we further used the degs from pvcs and mrcs to perform the enriched biological function analysis. the data clearly demonstrated that the degs in both pvcs and mrcs showed similar cellular functions . the number of enriched biological functions in pvcs and mrcs were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, in which  <dig> of them were in common. pvcs and mrcs were found to participate in different metabolic paths. carbohydrate metabolism was dominant in pvcs while amino acid and nucleic acid metabolism were prevalent in mrcs. more metabolisms were enriched in the mrcs, which might due to the rich mitochondria content in mrcs. in eels, studies on changing metabolism after treatments were performed in the 1970s ; however, to our knowledge, there are no studies that specifically focus on the metabolism of the two gill cell types. the suggested data here further supports the combined use of advanced metabolomics studies and the measurement of metabolites in gills to understand the underlying metabolism during osmoregulation.fig.  <dig> functional annotation analyses of the eel gill pvcs and mrcs. a distribution  of the putative human homolog encoded proteins with different sub-cellular locations. b distribution of the putative human homolog encoded proteins according to their functional type

in the enriched pathway analysis, some common and cell-type specific signaling pathways were identified to be activated in pvcs and mrcs during osmotic stress . the janus kinase /signal transduction and transcription  factors, axonal guidance, and ephrin-b were the common signaling pathways identified in both pvcs and mrcs. the jak/stat signaling plays an important role in immunity  <cit> , while our previous proteomics analysis in eel gills underlined the expression of different immune-related proteins upon osmotic stress  <cit> . the enriched pathway supports the notion that the immune system is involved in fish gill osmoregulation. for the axonal guidance signaling, it is mostly associated with cellular growth, proliferation, and development, and is regulated by the ephrin-b pathway  <cit> . gill tissues are known to exhibit substantial alterations in epithelial structures and functions in response to changes in water salinity and hardness  <cit> . this axonal guidance/ephrin-b pathway may contribute to the proliferation and anatomical localization of pvcs and mrcs to induce functional plasticity of gill tissues to withstand osmotic challenges. in this regard, our finding supports the hypothesis on the “short-term transformation and long-term replacement” in describing gill tissue remodeling processes during early and later phases of acclimation at different water salinities  <cit> .fig.  <dig> schematic figure showing the enriched canonical signaling pathways of the eel gill pvcs and mrcs under osmotic stress. pvcs and mrcs enriched different pathways under osmotic stress



in addition to the three common signaling pathways, other cell-type specific pathways were identified. pvcs were found to be regulated by two important hormonal pathways, the prolactin signaling and igf- <dig> signaling. prolactin was reported to reduce ion leakage in gills and to play an important role in fw acclimation  <cit> . it has recently been suggested that prolactin could regulate the expression of the sodium chloride cotransporter via prolactin receptor in zebrafish gills  <cit> . the igf- <dig> pathway was shown to be involved in sw acclimation  <cit> . moreover, our previous study showed that pvcs were responsive to prolactin or igf- <dig> treatment to increase the expression levels of the na+/k+/cl− co-transporter   <cit> . in addition to hormonal signaling, the integrin-linked kinase -akt , cytokine-related pathways such as il <dig>  and il <dig> signaling pathways and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α  pathways were identified in pvcs. these pathways have been well studied in human carcinogenesis , but their roles in osmoregulation remain unclear. in addition, the ipa identified the epithelial adherens junction signaling and epithelial mesenchymal transition  regulatory pathway in pvcs. these identified processes are highly related to cell proliferation/migration, cell-cell interaction, and functional transformation. cell migration was reported during gill remodeling in fish acclimated in waters of different salinities and hardness . in fact, an activation of the akt pathway was shown to induce the expression of osmotic stress transcription factor  <dig>  during hyperosmotic stress in a pvc culture  <cit> . the osmoregulatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α  and interleukins , were reported to play roles in the osmotic stress signaling network in fish to regulate epithelial responses to salinity changes .

for mrcs, two other cytokines-related pathways, il <dig> and endothelin- <dig> , were recognized. mrcs are well-known for their role in chloride transport  <cit> . exogenous edn <dig> was reported to regulate chloride transport in the opercular epithelium of killifish; its mrna expression levels were demonstrated to be increased in gills of killifish during sw acclimation  <cit> . moreover edn <dig> was recently suggested to inhibit the type a natriuretic peptide receptor, to reduce the expression of nitric oxide synthase , and to regulate the urinary sodium concentration in rat inner-medullary collecting duct cells  <cit> . in this regard, nos was shown to inhibit the expression of sodium pump  in the gills of salmon and trout  <cit> . since the mrcs are featured with a high abundance of na+/k+-atpase, an understanding of the functional roles of edn <dig> and nos in the regulation of na+-transport in mrcs for osmoregulation is important. in addition, some well-known osmoregulatory pathways like epidermal growth factor  signaling and renin-angiotensin  signaling were also identified. the egf signaling pathway is involved in volume and ion regulation , while the ra signaling is important for epithelial na+ transport and pressor functions  <cit> . furthermore, the myo-inositol biosynthesis pathway for the synthesis of a universally compatible osmolyte, myo-inositol , was found to be enriched. lastly, the analysis identified the tight junction signaling and rho gtpase signaling, and the osmotic stress induced rho pathway has been related to the tight junction rearrangement  <cit> . it should be noted that the enrichment of a particular pathway is based on the bioinformatics analysis. the degs during osmotic stress do not cover all the transcripts that are involved in the pathway, and they can be up- or down- regulated. to reach a solid conclusion, researchers must perform further experiments on specific targets.

CONCLUSIONS
physiological and molecular functions of gill cells have been studied for more than 60 years; however, the molecular responses in the gill pvcs and mrcs in relation to their functional phenotypes remain unclear. thus, we applied transcriptomic analysis to identify differential expressed transcripts in the two major gill cell types  in fw- and sw- acclimated eels. the study identifies newly annotated transcripts to enrich the eel gill database, and, for the first time, shows specific osmoregulatory adaptive responses in the pvcs and mrcs.

we understand that there may be a mis-annotation of eel sequences if using the other available model species databases. although there are published draft eel genome databases available, such as eeelbase and zf-genomics, the annotated sequences and confidence reads are still relatively small compared to other model organisms, which have limited the use of these databases for blast sequencing. there is a lack of integrated information for accurate bioinformatics prediction. efforts must be made to facilitate data exchange and communication between different groups after release of a dataset. the presence of highly similar isoforms, or unique eel transcripts could hamper the recent transcriptomic analysis studies; we are looking forward to the completion of the eel genome, which provides the real genome reference of this economically valuable and endangered species.
