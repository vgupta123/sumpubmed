BACKGROUND
background in neuroscience and metabolomics
schizophrenia is characterized by deficits in cognition known to be dependent upon the functional integrity of the prefrontal cortex . furthermore, compromised pfc function in schizophrenia is supported by a multitude of neuroimaging studies reporting hypometabolism , as evidenced by decreased blood flow or glucose utilization  <cit> . while the pathophysiological basis of pfc dysfunction in schizophrenia is not completely understood, a central role for nmda receptor hypofunction is widely supported. for example, subchronic exposure to the nmda receptor antagonist phencyclidine  induces cognitive deficits and a 'hypofrontality' which directly parallels that seen in schizophrenia  <cit> . furthermore, subchronic pcp exposure induces alterations in gabaergic cell markers and 5-ht receptor expression in the pfc similar to those seen in this disorder  <cit> . while this evidence places nmda receptor hypofunction central to the pathophysiology of pfc dysfunction in schizophrenia, the mechanisms through which nmda hypofunction promotes pfc dysfunction are poorly understood.

metabolomics is the comprehensive analysis of small molecule metabolites in biological systems  <cit> . it involves the study of the metabolome which is defined as all of the small molecular weight compounds within a sample that are required for metabolism, whose roles include growth and functionality  <cit> . sample sources include bacteria, parasites, animals and humans and sample types can include biofluids, cells or tissue extracts. metabolomics can be utilized as a tool for the characterization and quantification of all of the metabolites in a biological system. its applications include profiling disease biomarkers  <cit> , monitoring disease progression  <cit> , investigating xenobiotic metabolism  <cit> , investigating drug-induced toxicity  <cit>  and investigating metabolism in genetically modified animals  <cit> . mass spectrometry  has been employed extensively as an analytical platform for metabolomics studies  <cit> . the popularity of this approach has increased over the last decade, in part due to the advent of high resolution fourier transform mass spectrometers which offer improved reproducibility, accuracy and sensitivity. this makes mass spectrometry suitable for high throughput metabolomics studies  <cit> . in addition, the orbitrap mass spectrometers that are now available offer similar performance to ft-ms systems without the need for a high strength magnetic field  <cit> . hilic chromatography has been utilized as a separation technique prior to ms detection of polar metabolites in aqueous biofluids such as urine, serum and plasma  <cit> .

additionally, it has also been used for the detection of multiple neurotransmitters in primate cerebral cortex  <cit> . hilic chromatography has been chosen for metabolomic studies as it is useful for the analysis of highly polar metabolites which are poorly retained on reverse phase columns  <cit> . detailed reviews of the principles and applications of hilic have been previously outlined  <cit> . here, hilic-chromatography is utilized in combination with an ltq-orbitrap for metabolic profiling of metabolite extracts from the pfc of control and pcp-treated rats.

metabolomics represents a robust approach through which alterations in diverse metabolic pathways may be determined at a biological systems level. in this way a metabolomics approach may prove useful in further elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to pfc dysfunction in schizophrenia. furthermore, this approach may also allow for the identification of pfc metabolic biomarkers for the cognitive deficits in this disorder. while the metabolomics approach can provide a rich and comprehensive set of data, the appropriate quantitative analysis of this data has not been adequately developed. in particular, the identification of statistical differences in metabolic pathways between experimental groups rather than the identification of statistical differences in individual metabolites alone represents a major challenge to quantitatively identifying metabolic alterations at a systems level from metabolomic data. one method through which statistical differences in metabolic pathways can be identified from metabolomic data involves the representation of this data as a large, complex network of nodes  connected by real-value edges . this form of representation has high face validity as the relationship between two metabolites, in a given pathway, is governed by a single or series of enzymatic reactions that can be viewed as being represented by the correlation between the concentrations of the two metabolites. another advantage is that metabolomic data consist of a range of metabolites detected in both of the experimental groups of interest meaning that these data can be expressed as two complex networks based upon the same set of nodes. this data structure is amenable to analysis through the application of the generalized singular value decomposition  algorithm.

background in network science and spectral methods
large, complex interaction networks arise across many applications in science and technology  <cit> . spectral methods, based on information computed from eigenvectors or singular vectors, have been used successfully to reveal fundamental network properties. for example, we may wish to cluster objects into groups  <cit> , put objects into order  <cit>  or discover specific patterns of connectivity within subgroups  <cit> . in this work, we look at the case where two interaction data sets are available and the aim is discover differences between the two sets in the form of mutually exclusive clusters. for example, a given group of biologically defined entities, such as genes, proteins, metabolites or brain regions, may contain a subgroup that behaves in a coordinated manner under one condition, or in one organism, but not in another--the network with respect to one type of interaction contains a cluster that is not present in the other. we will show that the generalized singular value decomposition, which is becoming more widely used in computational biology  <cit>  can be justified as the basis of a network reordering approach. we also consider how to quantify the statistical significance of network patterns that are uncovered.

overall, this work develops and applies a novel algorithm in network science and shows that it reveals meaningful insights when applied to cutting-edge metabolomic data.

RESULTS
derivation of new algorithm
suppose that the square, symmetric, real-valued matrices a and b in ℝn×n represent two different types of interaction between a set of n nodes. we have in mind the case where the weights play the role of correlation coefficients. our aim is to discover clusters, in the sense of subsets of nodes that are mutually, pairwise, strongly connected through positive weights. the algorithm will also discover clusters of strong negative connectivity, although in practice this type of pattern is less likely to be present. however, we note that the arguments given below and the resulting algorithm remain valid in the case where the weights are non-negative, with zero representing the minimal level of similarity. the novelty of our approach is that in order to reveal interesting differences between the two types of connectivity data, we look for a set of nodes that form a good cluster with respect to a and a poor cluster with respect to b, or vice versa. as a starting point for a computational algorithm, we consider the identity   

for x ∈ ℝn. here ||·|| <dig> denotes the euclidean norm and  is one way to generalize the concept of out-degree to the case of a weighted network. suppose we wish to split the nodes into two groups such that nodes within each group are well-connected but nodes across different groups are poorly connected. we could use an indicator vector x ∈ ℝn to denote such a partition, with xs =  <dig> if node s is placed in group  <dig> and xs = - <dig> if node s is placed in group  <dig> 

fixing on two nodes, k and l, we could argue that the existence of a third node, i, such that aik and ail are both large and positive or both large and negative is evidence in favor of placing k and l in the same group . on the other hand small or oppositely signed values for aik and ail is evidence in favor of placing k and l in different groups. in terms of the indicator vector, this translates to

 <dig>  aikail large and positive ⇒ try to choose xkxl = + <dig> 

 <dig>  aikail small or negative ⇒ try to choose xkxl = - <dig> 

returning to the right-hand side of , we see that  is independent of the choice of indicator vector, and  gives a measure of how successfully we have incorporated the  desiderata in points  <dig> and  <dig> over all pairs k, l and third parties i. so we could judge the quality of an indicator vector by its ability to produce a large value of , provided other constraints, such as balanced group sizes, were satisfied.

analogously, we can argue that making  as negative as possible is a good way to avoid forming well-connected subgroups, and so the problem   

is a good basis for picking out strong clusters in a that are not present in b.

in general, optimizing over a large, discrete set of possibilities is computationally intractable, and hence we will follow the widely used practice of relaxing to an optimization over ℝn <cit> . this approach goes back as far as the pioneering work of fiedler  <cit>  and has some theoretical underpinning in the case where a single network is analyzed  <cit> . so, instead of  we have   

at this stage we recall that a general pair of matrices a ∈ ℝm×n and b ∈ ℝp×n can be simultaneously factorized using the generalized singular value decomposition  into   

where u ∈ ℝm×m and v ∈ ℝp×p are both orthogonal, x ∈ ℝn×n is invertible, c ∈ ℝm×n and s ∈ ℝp×n are diagonal with nonnegative entries such that c = diag and s = diag with q = min, and  <dig> ≤ c <dig> ≤ c <dig> ≤ ··· ≤ cn and s <dig> ≥ s <dig> ≥ ··· ≥ sq ≥  <dig>  <cit> . the ratios λi = ci/si are the generalized singular values of a and b.

a key property of the gsvd is that the columns of x are stationary points of the function f :ℝn ↦ ℝ given by f = || ax || <dig> /||bx || <dig>  with the generalized singular values λi giving the corresponding stationary values. hence, we may tackle the problem  through the gsvd. columns  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ... of x are candidates for finding good clusters in b that are poor clusters in a and, analogously, columns n, n -  <dig>  n -  <dig> ... of x are candidates for finding good clusters in a that are poor clusters in b.

to transform back from real to discrete domains, we may use the ordering of the elements in x to define a new ordering for the two networks. more precisely, we relabel row and column i of a and b as row and column pi, where  

in this way, the existence or lack of clusters in each network becomes apparent from inspection of the heat map of the reordered matrix. this is the approach that we use. we will also show that p-values can be computed to quantify the statistical significance of the results. the issue of fully automating the choice of cluster size is left as future work.

a variant of the algorithm
in our context, the matrices a and b are square, with m = n = p = n. in this case, if we make the additional assumption that a and b are invertible it is known that the gsvd is closely related to the standard singular value decompositions  of ab- <dig> and ba- <dig>  to see this, we could rearrange  into   

alternatively, we may let z = ax or y = bx in , to obtain the quadratic problems  

which can be solved through the standard svd.

it is known from spectral graph theory that the dominant singular vectors give good directions in which to look for clusters  <cit> . inverting the weight matrix reverses their importance  and hence a spectral clustering approach applied to a- <dig> will typically find the opposite of good clusters--poorly connected nodes will be grouped together  <cit> . so, intuitively, forming ab- <dig> in  should produce a data matrix for which the svd approach finds good clusters for a and poor clusters for b. analogously, the opposite holds for ba- <dig> 

having interpreted the algorithm this way, it is then natural to consider the reverse products, a-1b and b-1a, or, equivalently, to form the optimization problem   

we may interpret  from the point of view that making b-1x large encourages poor clusters for b, while making a-1x small encourages good clusters for a. in this case, we would base our algorithm on the gsvd of a- <dig> and b- <dig> 

in the situation where a and b are both symmetric, corresponding to undirected networks, we have, from ,  

and  

then we may appeal to the arguments given previously and use columns from the inverse of the third factor in the gsvd as the basis for reordering. with this approach we use columns of x -t rather than columns of x. we emphasize that although this heuristic derivation used an assumption that a and b are invertible, the gsvd, and hence the final algorithm, applies in the non-invertible case. also, the algorithms that we use do not require the computation of matrix inverses.

in tests on both synthetic and real network pairs, we found that this version of the algorithm was more effective,  <cit> . hence, in this work we focus on the approach of reordering networks pairs via columns of x -t. in summary, the first few columns of x -t should give orderings that favor clusters in b rather than a and vice versa for the final few columns. in our computational examples, we used the gsvd routine built in to matlab http://www.mathworks.com/.

synthetic test on binary networks
in this section we illustrate the algorithm in a simple, controlled case where we know the "correct" answer. we begin by considering binary networks, where results can be clearly visualized. we generated binary adjacency matrices a and b as shown in figure  <dig>  here we have  <dig> nodes. in both networks, nodes 1- <dig> are well connected. in a there is a well connected cluster consisting of nodes 6- <dig>  whereas in b there is a well connected cluster consisting of nodes 15- <dig>  to make the test more realistic, the clusters are not perfect; there are both missing edges  within the clusters and spurious edges  outside the clusters. our aim is to test whether the algorithms can identify the clusters that are particular to each data set. we then show how statistical significance can be quantified.

we emphasize that the node labeling in figure  <dig> was chosen purely to make the inherent structure visually apparent. any spectral reordering algorithm should be invariant to a relabeling of the input data. in our context, this follows from the fact that for any permutation matrix p, the factorizations a = ucx - <dig> and b = v sx - <dig> are equivalent to papt = c - <dig> and pbpt = s - <dig>  so, on the relabeled data matrices,  plays the role that was played by x, and our algorithm reorders based on the appropriately permuted columns of x -t, as required. in figure  <dig> we show the same two data sets with an arbitrary relabeling in order to illustrate that the inherent structure is no longer apparent. in essence, we are hoping that the algorithm will find the structure that has been buried in figure  <dig> 

in figure  <dig> we display the two adjacency matrices reordered with the algorithm; we show reordering with eight different columns of x -t, four from each end of the spectrum. we see that mutually exclusive structures have been uncovered. the reordering from the first column begins with nodes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  which form a cluster in b, but not a. the final column begins by picking out nodes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  which form the bulk of the 6- <dig> cluster in a. nodes  <dig> and  <dig>  which are missing from this sequential ordering, are placed at the head of the ordering in the penultimate column, which begins  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  so in summary, the 19th and 20th columns of x -t each reveal almost complete information about the exclusive cluster in a, and between them they capture the full cluster.

cluster validation
suppose we find τ nodes giving a good cluster s for b but a poor cluster for a when the graphs are reordered by column v from x -t. is this type of substructure likely to arise "by chance"? the following general approach can be used in order to determine a p -value, where we will regard a value below  <dig>  as indicating statistical significance.

initialization: compute a measure of cluster quality, c, for the promising substructure consisting of those τ nodes in networks a and b reordered by column v.

step 1: randomize the networks and obtain new data sets  and .

step 2: compute the gsvd for the randomized networks  and  and obtain a matrix .

step 3: compute the measure  for the τ node 'cluster' in  and  reordered by column v from .

p -value after performing m loops over steps  <dig> to  <dig>  compute a p -value as the proportion of  samples that exceed c.

for our cluster quality measure c we used  

for these binary graphs, the density f  of cluster s was defined as   

here, |e| represents the actual number of edges in the object block s, and |s| is the maximum possible number of edges.

for weighted graphs, in the case where the cluster is dominated by positive weights, we will generalize this to   

here, w denotes the average weight in block s. we note the denominator |s| cancels when ratios are computed in the p-value algorithm.

in figure  <dig>  we see that eight nodes  <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig>  form a cluster in a, but not in b, when the synthetic data is reordered with the final column of x -t. applying the procedure above, using permutation to randomize the networks m =  <dig> times as described below, we obtained a p-value of  <dig> . applying the same procedure, we also obtained a p-value of  <dig>  for the first  <dig> nodes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> when the synthetic data is reordered with the first column of x -t, which visually form a cluster in b, but not in a. these p-values  both indicate that the results are statistically significant. as a further test, we arbitrarily selected the subnetworks of a and b composed of nodes  <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig>  which correspond to the 12th to 18th components of the sorted final column from x -t. in this case, we would not expect to find a significant result. this is reflected in the large p-value of  <dig> . in more exhaustive experiments, three randomization methods were tested  <cit> :

• erdös-rényi: generate a classical random graph with the appropriate number of edges.

• redistribution: redistribute the entries in each row and each column of a, and perform the same operations on b.

• permutation: reorder the nodes in a and b and choose the first τ nodes in this new ordering. in this case, recomputation of the gsvd in step  <dig> is not necessary, due to the permutation invariance of the factorization.

of those three approaches, erdös-rényi may be the most commonly used method to randomize a binary network, whereas permutation extends most naturally to the case of weighted edges, so we used permutation in the test shown here. we also tested another simple cluster quality measure which is the ratio of density of edges within the cluster in one graph and that in the other graph.

these variations were studied within this general methodology on both real and synthetic data sets  <cit> . in all cases, comparable p -values were produced.

synthetic test on correlation networks
having tested the algorithm on binary networks, we now consider the case where weighted edges arise as correlation coefficients.

first, we generate two correlation matrices a and b as shown in figure  <dig>  here, each graph has  <dig> nodes, and each entry is real valued, representing the correlation coefficient between the corresponding nodes. the same cluster patterns given for the synthetic binary matrices in figure  <dig> were built in to the synthetic correlation data: nodes 1- <dig> are well connected in both networks; in a there is a well connected cluster consisting of nodes 6- <dig>  whereas in b there is a well connected cluster consisting of nodes 15- <dig>  some noise was added to the clusters to make this test more realistic.

more precisely, in our computation, the value of each entry  in a and b as shown in figure  <dig> is generated from a pair of  <dig> ×  <dig> rectangular matrices da and db. the corresponding cluster patterns are built from signals. figure  <dig> shows the nine signals that take part in the data. these are row vectors with  <dig> elements. we use v <cit> , v <cit> , v <cit> ,..., v <cit>  to denote them. from these signals, we set up two matrices

• da ∈ ℝ20×50: the first  <dig> rows are linear combinations of v <cit> , v <cit> , v <cit> , v <cit> , v <cit> , v <cit>  and v <cit> . rows  <dig> to  <dig> are combinations of v <cit>  and v <cit> . the remaining rows  are gaussian pseudorandom numbers.

• db ∈ ℝ20×50: the first  <dig> rows are linear combinations of v <cit> , v <cit> , v <cit> , v <cit> , v <cit> , v <cit>  and v <cit> . rows  <dig> to  <dig> are gaussian pseudorandom numbers. the remaining rows  are combinations of v <cit>  and v <cit> .

building up the rows from the underlying signals in this manner allowed us to construct the correlation patterns seen in figure  <dig> 

although the algorithm is invariant to permutation, for visual clarity, we also shuffled the synthetic correlation data sets a and b before applying our algorithm to them. figure  <dig> shows the same synthetic correlation data sets with an arbitrary relabeling.

we present the results from our algorithm in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  we show the relabeled a and b reordered with two extreme columns of x -t, one from each of the two ends of the spectrum. the reorderings reveal the mutually exclusive cluster structures of a and b. we also applied the cluster validation method to the structures uncovered by the reorderings using random permutation. in figure  <dig> we see that the first column of x -t picks out the continuous nodes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  which form a good cluster in b but not in a . the reordering from the final column of x -t shown in figure  <dig> reveals that the 6- <dig> cluster in a but not in b was completely uncovered by the nodes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> .

in summary, this additional synthetic test illustrates that our gsvd based algorithm can be extended to reveal the pattern difference between two relative correlation matrices in terms of clustering.

quantitative determination of metabolic pathways disrupted in the prefrontal cortex of pcp-treated animals
sieve analysis  revealed significant pcp-induced alterations in the level of specific metabolites in the pfc of pcp-treated rats . these changes were evident in multiple metabolic pathways as defined by the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  metabolite pathways database. significant changes were evident in  glutamate metabolism ,  the alanine, aspartate and glutamate pathway ,  phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan metabolism ,  purine metabolism  and  butanoate metabolism . this suggested that these metabolic pathways are disrupted in the pfc of pcp-treated animals. however, this simple level of analysis prevents any quantitative and statistically rigorous determination of the predefined  metabolic pathways disrupted in the pfc of pcp-treated animals.

                              p 
in the context of this study the aim of applying the gsvd algorithm to metabolomic data from control and pcp-treated animals was to quantitatively determine which predefined metabolic pathways were altered in pcp-treated animals. the inter-metabolite pearson's correlation coefficient  was used as the metric of the functional association between each pair of metabolites and was generated from the metabolite peak intensities, as determined by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry , across all animals within the same experimental group . these correlations were fisher transformed to give the correlation data a normal distribution. this resulted in a pair of symmetric, square, real-valued { <dig> × 98} partial correlation matrices . each within-group matrix represents the specific association strength between each of the  <dig> possible pairs of metabolites in that experimental group. in the simplest biological case the correlation coefficient between two metabolites  in the matrix represents the series of enzymatic reactions responsible for converting one metabolite into another. however, it should be noted that this simple interpretation does not account for the complex relationships that may influence the correlation between two metabolites, such as the involvement of metabolites in alternative, often parallel, metabolic pathways. there are important limitations that must be recognized when modeling metabolomic data as a complex network of interactions between metabolites  such as the potential for correlations to exist between metabolites that are not biologically relevant. the impact of such erroneous associations on the interpretation of the data as outlined in this paper will be limited by the approach of characterizing alterations at the level of metabolic pathways, involving multiple metabolites , rather than considering the disruption of single correlation coefficient between two metabolites.

our network treats interactions between molecules as bidirectional, and so the set of interactions between molecules forms an undirected weighted network. in essence the gsvd algorithm allows the reordering of the two experimental matrices a  and b  with the aim of discovering a new node  ordering that reveals clusters of nodes that exhibit strong connectivity  in one network but not the other. in the context of this data the gsvd algorithm was used to identify clusters of metabolites present in one experimental group that are not present in the other with the aim of identifying those metabolic pathways in the pfc disrupted by pcp treatment. once the matrices had been reordered through the gsvd algorithm the significant presence of a cluster in the given network was statistically tested by comparison of the cluster quality measure in the real networks relative to that in  <dig> random permutations of the initial matrices. the original metabolomic networks are shown in figure  <dig>  where matrix a represents control animals and b represents pcp-treated animals. figures  <dig> and  <dig> show the networks reordered by the first and the final column of x -t, respectively. the original position of each metabolite detected by lc-ms  and its new position in each of the reordered matrices  are shown in additional file  <dig>  visually, in figure  <dig> there was no obvious pattern of clustering that would identify significant clusters of metabolites present in pcp-treated animals that were not present in controls. in contrast, in figure  <dig> there appeared to be clusters of metabolites present in the pfc of control animals that were not present in pcp-treated animals . for figure  <dig> the significance of the top cluster  and the bottom cluster  was confirmed, indicating that there were clusters of metabolites significantly present in control  animals that were not present in pcp-treated  animals. the identity of the metabolites, the kegg pathways in which each metabolite is involved, and the pcp-induced alteration in the overt level of each metabolite  are shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig> for the top and bottom cluster, respectively. in contrast to the metabolite clustering shown in figure  <dig> there was no evidence in figure  <dig> for any significant cluster of metabolites present in pcp-treated animals  that was not present in control  animals:  potential top cluster  p =  <dig> ;  potential middle cluster  p =  <dig> .

                              p 
rigorous significance testing, involving multiple potential metabolite clusters, confirmed that there were no significant clusters of metabolites in pcp-treated animals that were not present in controls . following significance testing of potential metabolite clusters in the gsvd reordered matrices, hypergeometric probability  was applied to test the significance of kegg defined metabolite pathway over-representation in these clusters. the results for hypergeometric probability testing are shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig> 

discussion
through its application to metabolomic data we have clearly demonstrated the added value that can be gained from applying the gsvd algorithm to two sets of complex, network data based upon the same set of nodes. in particular, we have demonstrated that the combined application of the gsvd algorithm with hypergeometric probability analysis provides an analytical framework by which statistical alterations in predefined metabolic pathways between experimental groups can be defined from complex metabolomic data. there is a great unmet need for this type of analytical approach in metabolomics, as well as in the other -omics fields , which allows the quantification of alterations at the biological systems  level rather than simply identifying significant alterations of discrete measures .

through the application of this analytical approach we identified statistically significant alterations in specific, pre-defined metabolic pathways  that may contribute to pfc dysfunction in pcp-treated animals, and so in schizophrenia. this included the disruption of the  alanine, aspartate and glutamate ,  arginine and proline ,  butanoate ,  nicotinate and nicotinamide ,  glycine, serine and threonine metabolic pathways as well as an imbalance in  metabolites active as neurotransmitter ligands . the disruption of metabolic pathways involving glutamate in the pfc of pcp-treated rats seems particularly pertinent given the reported alterations in extracellular glutamate availability in the pfc following repeated pcp treatment  <cit>  and the central hypothesis of hypofunctional glutamatergic pfc neurotransmission in schizophrenia  <cit> . in addition to altered glutamate metabolism there was also evidence to support an imbalance in multiple metabolites known to be active at glutamate receptors. this included an imbalance in the relationship between glutamate, l-aspartate and tauring  which are all known to be active at glutamate receptors. furthermore, evidence for the disruption of glycine, serine and threonine metabolism may suggest that glycine and serine activity as co-agonists at the nmda receptors may be disrupted in the pfc of pcp-treated animals. however, it is important to note that we failed to detect glycine levels in our samples and serine levels appear to be overtly unchanged. the possibility of altered glycine levels in the pfc of pcp-treated rats warrants further investigation given the ability of glycine and nmda receptor glycine site agonists to reverse subchronic pcp-induced alterations in pfc dopaminergic neurotransmission  <cit> , which may be central to the impact of subchronic pcp treatment on cognition. altered glycine, serine and threonine metabolism in the pfc of pcp-treated animals is also consistent with the hypothesis that glycine and serine represent potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of schizophrenia  <cit> . in addition, we found evidence to suggest that gaba neurotransmission was also significantly decreased in the pfc of pcp-treated rats, which may relate to the compromised integrity of gabaergic interneurones in these animals  <cit> , which closely resemble the gabaergic interneuron alterations seen in schizophrenia. the imbalance in glutamate, glutamine and gaba levels identified in the pfc of pcp-treated rats may directly contribute to the hypofrontality  seen in these animals, as detected using the 14c-2-deoxyglucose imaging technique  <cit> , as all of these metabolites are intimately linked through metabolic pathways and have a central role in regulating the coupling of neuronal activity to cerebral glucose metabolism  <cit> .

our results also suggest that glutamatergic dysfunction in the pfc of pcp-treated rats is not limited to the disruption of glutamatergic neurotransmission but also involves the disruption of the metabolic pathways in which glutatmate is involved. for example, altered glutamate metabolism may directly contribute to the disruption of the arginine-proline metabolic pathway in the pfc of pcp-treated animals. the significant disruption of the arginine pathway in pcp-treated animals suggests that prolonged nmda receptor hypofunction may result in disrupted nitric oxide  signalling in the pfc. there is increasing evidence that no signalling is directly linked to nmda receptor activity through regulation of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase   <cit>  and that no signaling contributes to the deficits in cognition that arise from acute nmda receptor blockade  <cit> . the finding that citrulline levels, a metabolite in the arginine-proline pathway, are significantly decreased in the pfc of the pcp-treated rats in this study further supports the suggestion that nos activity is altered in the pfc of these animals, as this metabolite is formed by nos when it releases no from l-arginine. this suggests that nmda receptor hypofunction may underlie the decreased nos activity and protein expression levels reported in the pfc of schizophrenia patients  <cit>  and may contribute to the cognitive deficits seen in this disorder.

in addition to quantitatively defining the specific metabolic pathways altered by experimental manipulation, our results suggest that the gsvd algorithm can identify discrete series of metabolic reactions altered by experimental manipulation. in this way, while we found no significant evidence to support the widespread disruption of purine metabolism, or the significant disruption of any other kegg defined metabolic pathway in the bottom cluster as detected using the gsvd, we did find evidence in this cluster to suggest that a specific series of purine reactions were significantly disrupted in the pfc of pcp-treated animals. these disrupted purinergic reactions in the pfc of pcp-treated animals were:  

this result suggests that the activity of adenylosuccinate synthase , the enzyme responsible for the conversion of imp to adenylosuccinate, may be significantly increased in the pfc of pcp-treated animals. an increase in the functional activity of this enzyme could result in both the increased level of adenylosuccinate and the altered balance in the enzyme's downstream metabolites  seen in the pfc of pcp-treated animals. while the influence of prolonged nmda receptor hypofunction on the functional activity of this specific enzyme remains to be confirmed, and clearly warrants further systematic investigation, the recent finding of altered adss gene expression in schizophrenia  <cit>  and the association of adss gene polymorphisms with schizophrenia  <cit>  further highlights a potential role for this metabolic pathway in this disorder. in addition, a role for this metabolic pathway in cognition and schizophrenia is supported by the observation that inherited deficiency in the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of adenylosuccinate  results in mental retardation and autistic features  <cit> . furthermore, the asl gene maps to chromosome 22q <dig> -q <dig>  in humans  <cit>  and these chromosomal loci have been repeatedly linked to schizophrenia  <cit> . the disruption of this metabolic pathway may also contribute to the reduced rate of cerebral glucose metabolism in the pfc of pcp-treated animals  <cit>  as asl deficiency results in hypometabolism in frontal cortical structures  <cit> . overall, these results suggest that the potential role of this specific series of metabolic reactions and its enzymes in cognition and schizophrenia warrants further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
this work addresses the scenario where a pair of networks describes two different patterns of connection between a common set of nodes. we argued from first principles that the generalized singular value decomposition ) can form the basis of a very useful computational tool. in practice, we have shown that this new computational network reordering technique was able to identify alterations in metabolic pathways in the pfc of rats treated subchronically with pcp that may contribute to the pfc dysfunction and cognitive deficits seen in these animals. furthermore, the metabolic pathways identified as being disrupted in the pfc of pcp-treated rats trough the application of this new computation technique clearly overlap with those metabolic species known to be disrupted in schizophrenia. applying this new algorithm in this way also identified novel pathways that may also be relevant to schizophrenia. in this way we identified alterations in glutamate metabolism and metabolic pathways central to glutamatergic neurotransmission, alterations in arginine and proline metabolism and the disruption of a novel series of purine reactions that may contribute to the pfc dysfunction and cognitive deficits seen in schizophrenia.
