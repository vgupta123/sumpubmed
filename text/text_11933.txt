BACKGROUND
peanut  is widely used as a food and cash crop around the world. it is mainly grown by resource-poor farmers in africa and asia to produce edible oil, and for human and animal consumption. peanut is a member of the fabaceae, tribe aeschynomeneae, subtribe stylosanthinae, genus arachis. in this genus,  <dig> diploid and tetraploid species have been described  <cit> . a. hypogaea is the only species that has been truly domesticated although several species have been cultivated for their seed or forage  <cit> . cultivated peanut is considered to be an allotetraploid  originated from a single hybridization event between two wild diploids with a and b genome  <cit> . several studies aimed at identifying the wild diploid ancestors of a. hypogaea. the wild species a. duranensis and a. ipaënsis appeared to be the best candidates for the a and b genome donors, respectively  <cit> .

polyploidy is a widespread process that played a major role in higher plants' speciation and adaptation. the stages of polyploid formation usually include reproductive isolation from the progenitors  <cit> . as for many polyploid species, cultivated peanut has experienced a genetic bottleneck which, superimposed with the effects of the domestication, has greatly narrowed the genetic diversity. the low level of dna polymorphism between cultivated genotypes has been described by many authors  <cit> . more recently, a rate of polymorphism of  <dig> % has been reported between two cultivated varieties, used as parents of a ril population, surveyed with  <dig> ssr markers  <cit> . the low level of polymorphism within cultivated peanut has greatly hampered the application of molecular breeding approaches for the genetic improvement of cultivated peanut. up to date, few genetic linkage maps have been published in arachis. at the diploid level, three genetic maps involving species with a and b genomes, one based on rflp markers  <cit>  and the other ones on ssr markers  <cit> , have been produced. the a genome ssr based map has been recently extended using legume anchor markers and aligned with medicago and lotus genomic sequences  <cit> . at the tetraploid level, two genetic maps were also reported. varshney et al.  <cit>  reported the detection of drought tolerance qtls based on a cultivated × cultivated ssr genetic map. although the genetic map remained unsaturated, due to the low level of polymorphism between cultivated peanut varieties, qtls have been detected attesting of the interest of molecular breeding tools in genetic improvement of peanut. burow et al.  <cit>  reported the construction of a rflp map, based on a bc <dig> population deriving from a cross between a wild synthetic amphidiploid  and a cultivated peanut variety . the synthetic amphidiploid, used to overcome the reproductive barriers between the wild diploids and the cultivated species, allowed the genome-wide analysis of the transmission of chromatin between wild and cultivated species of the genus arachis. however, the wild parents used to create the amphidiploid  are unlikely to be the ancestors of a. hypogaea  <cit> . the genetic mapping of populations derived from the cross between the most probable wild progenitors of a. hypogaea and a cultivated peanut variety has, to our knowledge, never been reported.

genome-wide introgression of a small fraction of the wild genome species while keeping the genetic background of the cultivated is a good mean to explore the largely untapped reservoir of useful alleles of interest that remain in the wild species. this is especially interesting for species with narrow genetic basis. this approach has been widely utilized for the introgression of favourable qtl for various traits in tomato  <cit> , in rice  <cit> , in wheat  <cit>  and in barley  <cit> . in peanut, the reproductive barriers between wild and cultivated species, the technical difficulties encountered in making large number of crosses as well as the short period between sowing and flowering have impeded the efforts to apply a marker assisted backcross  approach for the development of interspecific introgression line populations.

in this study, we report for the first time the development and the analysis of the genome-wide segment introgressions of the most probable wild progenitors of the cultivated peanut species  into the background of the cultivated fleur  <dig> variety through the construction of a ssr genetic map as well as the evaluation of the coverage and the length of the wild genome segments in a bc1f <dig> and bc2f <dig> populations. this work benefits from the recently developed synthetic amphidiploid 4x  <cit>  that made possible the interspecific introgressions.

methods
plant material
a panel comprising  <dig> wild diploid accessions , a tetraploid aabb amphidiploid 4x, hereafter called aiad and a cultivated tetraploid aabb variety , was used in this study. the amphidiploid was developed by favero et al.  <cit>  by crossing a. ipaënsis kg <dig>  with a. duranensis v <dig> . the resulting f <dig> was doubled with colchicine to produce a fertile fixed synthetic amphidiploid. fleur  <dig>  a local peanut variety grown in senegal, is a spanish type short cycle variety, high yielding and tolerant to drought. a bc1f <dig> and a bc2f <dig> populations deriving from the cross between fleur  <dig> used as female recurrent parent and the amphidiploid aiad were produced. the bc1f <dig> and bc2f <dig> populations were developed under greenhouse conditions in senegal in  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. the crossing scheme used to generate the two populations is shown in figure  <dig>  the bc1f <dig> population comprised  <dig> individuals. forty six bc1f <dig> plants were selected based on introgression analysis and crossed with the fleur  <dig> recurrent parent to produce the bc2f <dig> generation.

dna isolation
young leaves were harvested from  <dig> day old plants and immediately stored at 4°c in ice before dna extraction. dna was extracted from  <dig> mg of fresh leaves following a slightly modified matab protocol  <cit> . briefly, leaves were ground in liquid nitrogen using a mortal and pestle and dissolved in  <dig> μl of matab buffer at 74°c. the samples were incubated  <dig> minutes at 74°c and cooled during  <dig> minutes at room temperature. a volume of  <dig> μl of cia  was added in each sample and all samples were shaken gently until homogenization before centrifugation at  <dig> rpm during  <dig> minutes. the supernatant was harvested and the dna was precipitated with  <dig> μl of 2-propanol. after centrifugation, pellets were washed with  <dig> μl of 70% ethanol, air dried and dissolved in  <dig> μl of te.

microsatellite analysis
four hundred twenty three already-published ssr markers  <cit>  plus  <dig> unpublished long size ssr markers from embrapa and the universidade católica de brasília were used in this study. a total of  <dig> ssr markers have been screened for polymorphism on the amphidiploid and its two wild diploid parents, and on the cultivated fleur  <dig> variety. for a given ssr locus, the forward primer was designed with a 5'-end m <dig> tail . pcr amplifications were performed in a mj research ptc-100™ thermocycler  or in an eppendorf mastercycler on  <dig> ng of dna in a  <dig> μl final volume of buffer ,  <dig> mm kcl,  <dig> % w/v gelatin, and  <dig>  mm mgcl2) containing  <dig>  μm of the m13-tailed primer,  <dig>  μm of the other primer,  <dig> μm of dntp,  <dig> u of taq dna polymerase  and  <dig>  μm of m <dig> primer-fluorescent dye ir <dig> or ir <dig> . the touchdown pcr programme used was as follow: initial denaturation at 95°c for  <dig> min; following by  <dig> cycles of 94°c for  <dig> s, tm  for  <dig> min, and 72°c for  <dig> min. after these cycles, an additional round of  <dig> cycles of 94°c for  <dig> s, tm for  <dig> min, and 72°c for  <dig> mn and a final elongation step at 72°c for  <dig> min was performed. ir <dig> or ir800-labeled pcr products were diluted 7-fold and 5-fold respectively, subjected to electrophoresis in a  <dig> % polyacrylamide gel and then sized by the ir fluorescence scanning system of the sequencer . migration images were analysed using jelly  <dig>   and exported as a data table. segregations were checked for distortion to the expected 1: <dig> ratio using a chi <dig> test at a significance level of  <dig> .

genetic map construction
the polymorphic markers were used to genotype  <dig> individuals of the bc1f <dig> population. the linkage analysis was performed using mapdisto software version  <dig> . <dig>   <cit>  and carthagene software version  <dig>   <cit> . the origins of the alleles  were determined by comparison to the alleles coming from the diploid progenitors of the amphidiploid. mapdisto software was used in a first step, for the linkage group determination and marker ordering within each linkage group. a minimum lod of  <dig> and maximum recombination fraction of  <dig>  were fixed for the linkage group determination using the "find groups" command. the order of the markers within each linkage group was estimated using the "order" command. the markers that had not been placed at lod  <dig> were tried at decreasing lod, down to a lod of  <dig> and a maximum recombination fraction of  <dig> . these markers are indicated in italic on the map . the quality of the genotyping data at a specific marker was controlled using the "drop locus" command. the few markers having bad quality genotyping data were discarded from the linkage analysis. in a second step, carthagene software was used for the optimization of the best marker order determined by mapdisto. this was done applying the simulated "annealing" and "greedy" algorithms. the best maps obtained were improved using the "flips" and the "polish" commands. genetic distances between markers were computed using kosambi mapping function.

introgression analysis
from the map of  <dig> ssr markers previously developed on the bc1f <dig> generation, a framework map comprising  <dig> ssr markers was derived. compared to the initial map, this framework offered a regular coverage of all the linkage groups. these  <dig> ssr markers were used to genotype  <dig> bc2f <dig> individuals.

introgression analysis of the bc1f <dig> and bc2f <dig> populations was performed using the cssl finder software version  <dig> b <dig>  <cit> . to select a subset of bc1f <dig> and bc2f <dig> lines providing an optimal coverage of donor genome into the recurrent background, we imposed a target length of the introgressed wild segments of  <dig> cm, an overlapping of adjacent segments for a given lg and the best possible return to the background of the cultivated variety.

the percentage of wild genome in the bc1f <dig> and bc2f <dig> generations and its relative diminution between the two generations, the mean size of wild introgression segments per lg and per generation, as well as the distribution of the wild segment lengths were estimated using the genotyping data available for each generation. the analysis was conducted on lgs longer than  <dig> cm. the lengths of the introgressed segments were calculated as the sum of consecutive intervals having a heterozygous genotype plus half the size of each flanking interval having a recurrent homozygous genotype.

RESULTS
ssr polymorphism and origin of the markers
among the  <dig> ssr markers screened,  <dig>  were polymorphic between fleur  <dig> and aiad. at a given ssr locus, the sub-genomic origin of the alleles was determined by comparison with the alleles of the diploid parents of the amphidiploid a. ipaënsis and a. duranensis that were included on each gel. this allowed distinguishing three categories of markers among the  <dig> polymorphic markers:  <dig> ssrs that were polymorphic for the a genome ,  <dig> ssrs that were polymorphic for the b genome  and  <dig> ssrs that were polymorphic for the two genomes . the largest proportion of polymorphic markers originated from the a genome donor a. duranensis , the b genome donor a. ipaënsis generating  <dig> % of polymorphic markers.

genetic map construction
among the  <dig> polymorphic ssrs, we randomly selected  <dig> markers polymorphic for the a genome, all the markers polymorphic the b genome and those polymorphic for the two genomes. a total of  <dig> ssrs were used to genotype the population of  <dig> bc1f <dig> individuals. the  <dig> ssr markers that showed a clear electrophoretic profile amplified  <dig> loci. finally,  <dig> loci were mapped in  <dig> linkage groups , spanning a total map distance of  <dig>  cm with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers . the difference of polymorphism between the a and b genomes had an effect on the number of markers mapped on each genome, and the number and size of the linkage groups. for the a genome,  <dig> loci were mapped in  <dig> lgs with a number of markers per lgs varying between  <dig> and  <dig> , and the length of the lgs ranging from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm . for the b genome,  <dig> loci were mapped on  <dig> lgs with a number of markers per lgs varying between  <dig> and  <dig>  and the length of the lgs ranging from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm .

the comparison of the a and b genomes was undertaken using  <dig> ssr markers that mapped on both a and b lgs. the a and b lgs were considered to be homeologous when they shared at least  <dig> common markers. this allowed distinguishing  <dig> pairs of homeologous lgs  and one quadruplet involving the lgs a <dig>  b <dig>  a <dig> and b <dig>  lg a <dig> shared three markers with the upper part of lg b <dig> corresponding to at least the half of this lg. the lower part of lg b <dig> shared three markers with the upper part of lg a <dig>  furthermore, the lower part of lg a <dig> shared three markers with lg b <dig> . the small lg b <dig> shared  <dig> marker with lg a <dig>  an overall good collinearity was observed between homeologous lgs. however, three inversions of chromosomal segments were observed on the homeologous lgs a01/b <dig>  a03/b <dig>  and a09/b <dig>  small inversions were also observed on the homeologous lgs a08/b <dig>  these inversions might result from artefacts as they concerned closely linked markers with more than one possible order having similar lod values. no mosaic composition of linkage groups, where a genome markers would map together with b genome markers, was observed.

a total of  <dig> ssr markers  showed significant segregation distortion at p <  <dig> . apart from  <dig> markers mapped on lgs b <dig> , b <dig> , b <dig> , and lg a <dig>  all the distorted markers were concentrated in specific zones of  <dig> different lgs . differences between the a and b genomes were also observed. for the a genome, only  <dig> markers  showed segregation distortions compared to  <dig>  for the b genome. for the a genome, in the zones of distortion of lgs a <dig> and a <dig>  all the distorted markers were skewed toward the alleles of the cultivated parent. for the b genome, the zones of distorted markers of lgs b <dig> and b <dig> were skewed toward the allele of the wild parent while those of b <dig> and b <dig> were skewed toward the allele of the cultivated parent.

fifteen primer pairs  amplified consistently more than one locus on the same genome. we were able to map the duplicated loci for the markers ah- <dig>  pm <dig>  seq18a <dig>  seq18g <dig>  seq19h <dig>  tc11b <dig> and tc9e <dig>  apart from the loci amplified by tc9e <dig> that mapped on the same lg , the loci amplified by ac2c <dig>  ah- <dig>  pm <dig>  seq14d <dig>  seq18a <dig>  seq18g <dig>  seq19h <dig>  seq3c <dig>  seq4h <dig>  seq9e <dig>  tc11b <dig>  tc19e <dig>  tc23f <dig> and tc40c <dig> mapped on different lgs suggesting possible segmental duplications. these markers were identified by the number  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> on the map .

comparison with peanut published genetic maps
conserved structural features between tetraploid maps
the present tetraploid map was compared to the rflp based tetraploid bc1f <dig> map published by burow et al.  <cit> , further called "burow's map" involving a cross between a. hypogaea variety florunner and the synthetic amphidiploid txag <dig> ]4x). a. batizocoi was considered to be the b genome donor and a. cardenasii and a diogoi were the donors of the a genome. in that cross,  <dig> lgs spanning a total genetic distance of  <dig> cm  were obtained. this map size was slightly larger than our map. a similar number of loci had been mapped on the a genome  but the number of loci mapped on the b genome of the burow's map was about  <dig> fold larger than on the present map . the mean length of the a genome lgs was similar between the  <dig> maps  while the mean length of the b genome lgs of the burow's map was  <dig>  larger than that of the present map . the difference in map size between the two studies seems related to the difference of the number of mapped markers on the b genome. interestingly, conservation of synteny between one b genome lg and two a genome lgs was observed in the two maps. on our map, lg b <dig> shared common markers with lg a <dig> and a <dig> while on burow's map, lg  <dig> shared common markers with lg  <dig>  and  <dig> . moreover, burow et al.  <cit>  has reported structural differences, mainly chromosome segment inversion, between four pairs of homeologous lgs . inversions of chromosomal segments have been observed for at least  <dig> lgs in our map .

comparison with diploid map
the results from the present tetraploid map were compared to the ssr based diploid f <dig> map  <cit> , involving a cross between two wild diploids with a genome, a. duranensis and a. stenosperma. in that population,  <dig> lgs covering a total map length of  <dig>  cm  have been described. the total map length was slightly longer than what we obtained in our map when considering the total size of the lgs of the a genome . the proportion of distorted markers found in the study of moretzsohn et al.  <cit>  was higher than what we recorded for our a genome map . given that a similar number of individuals were used for the map construction in the two studies, the length difference between the  <dig> maps might be related to the higher proportion of distorted markers on the moretzsohn's map.

the synteny between the  <dig> maps was assessed with  <dig> common ssr markers. for all the  <dig> lgs of the a genome of our map, we could identify corresponding lgs in the diploid map with an overall good collinearity. the salient features of the comparison of the two maps are shown in figure  <dig>  the number of common ssr markers per homologous lgs varied between  <dig> and  <dig>  however the synteny was not conserved for four lgs of our map when compared to the diploid map. lg a <dig> and a <dig> of our map shared  <dig>  and  <dig>  markers with lg  <dig> of the diploid map respectively. lgs  <dig> and  <dig> of the diploid map shared  <dig>  and  <dig>  markers with lg a <dig> of our map respectively. moreover, lg a <dig> of our map that was homologous to lg  <dig> of the diploid map shared also  <dig> common markers  with lg  <dig> of the diploid map. for lgs a <dig> and a <dig> of our map, there was no evidence of spurious linkage between two different lgs as all the markers in these lgs were mapped at lod ≥  <dig> 

introgression analysis
in the bc1f <dig> generation, the percentage of heterozygous genome varied between  <dig> % and  <dig> %  while in the bc2f1generation it varied between  <dig> % and  <dig> % . this percentage is slightly inferior to the expected 25%, which is consistent with the selection that occurred at each generation for the best possible return to the background of the cultivated variety. from bc1f <dig> to bc2f <dig>  we noted more than 50% reduction of the wild allele contribution to the genotypic constitution of the bc2f <dig> individuals. the distribution of the lengths of the wild segments in the bc1f <dig> and the bc2f <dig> generations was calculated for  <dig> lgs having a length comprised between  <dig> and  <dig>  cm . the average lengths of the wild introgressed segments into the background of the cultivated were  <dig>  cm in bc1f <dig> and  <dig>  cm in bc2f <dig>  from bc1f <dig> to bc2f <dig> generations, the segment lengths decreased of 33%. as shown in figure  <dig>  more than 15% of the bc1f <dig> lines and 20% of the bc2f <dig> lines had segment lengths comprised between  <dig> and  <dig> cm.

the cssl-finder software was used to select a subset of bc1f <dig> lines and, then, of bc2f <dig> lines, which ensured, in each generation, an optimal coverage of the wild genome with overlapping target segment lengths of  <dig> cm between neighbouring lines and the best possible return to the cultivated background. in the bc1f <dig> population, a subset of  <dig> lines was selected. the segment lengths ranged between  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm . all the adjacent segments were in overlapping position and the genome percentage of the recurrent cultivated variety ranged between 38% and 68% . in the bc2f <dig> population, a subset of  <dig> lines was selected. the segment lengths ranged between  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm  and the percentage of the recurrent background between 62% and 94% . a graphical representation of the bc2f <dig> selected lines is shown in figure  <dig>  the level of coverage of the wild introgressed segments in the background of the cultivated variety was optimal both in the bc1f <dig> and bc2f <dig> populations.

discussion
in this study, the construction of a tetraploid molecular genetic map using a bc1f <dig> population and the development of a bc2f <dig> population allowed the analysis of the introgression of wild alleles in the background of a cultivated peanut variety. several points have been highlighted including  the low level of polymorphism of the ssr markers especially between the b wild genome a. ipaënsis and the b genome of the cultivated,  the collinearity between the a and b genomes, the synteny between tetraploid and diploid maps, and the similarity between tetraploid maps,  the good level of introgression of the wild genome segments in the background of the cultivated variety.

ssr polymorphism data is consistent with a. duranensis and a. ipaënsis being the most probable progenitors of the cultivated species
cultivated peanut arachis hypogaea is considered to be an allotetraploid  originated from a single hybridization event between two wild diploids with a and b genomes  <cit> , followed by spontaneous duplication of the chromosomes. the identification of the wild progenitors of the cultivated peanut has been the object of numerous investigations using various approaches including cross-compatibility  <cit> , molecular markers  <cit> , biogeography  <cit> , gene sequence comparison  <cit> , physical mapping of rrna genes  <cit>  and genome in situ hybridization   <cit> . the most probable hypothesis gave a. duranensis as the wild donor of the a genome and a. ipaënsis as the wild donor of the b genome. in our study, a close relationship has been observed between the putative wild progenitor's a. duranensis and a. ipaënsis and the cultivated a. hypogaea var. fleur  <dig> based on  <dig> ssr markers. a. duranensis and a. ipaënsis shared  <dig> % and  <dig> % of common ssr alleles with the a genome and the b genome of a hypogaea respectively. moreover,  <dig> % polymorphism was observed between the synthetic amphidiploid aiad and the cultivated fleur  <dig> variety. this is lower than the 83% of polymorphism that has been observed between the synthetic polyploid txag <dig> ]4x) and the cultivated florunner variety based on rflp markers  <cit> . this result indicates that a. duranensis and a. ipaiensis are more closely related to the a and the b genomes of the cultivated species than are a. cardenasii and a. diogoi for the a and a. batizocoi for the b genomes respectively. moreover, the bc <dig> tetraploid map obtained by crossing the synthetic amphidiploid aiad and fleur  <dig> indicated a disomic inheritance of all loci. for all the lgs obtained, the markers that were polymorphic for the a genome mapped on a lgs and those polymorphic for the b genome mapped on b lgs. the chromosome pairing seems to happen between "homologous genome" attesting the high affinity between a. duranensis and the a genome of the cultivated species, and between a. ipaënsis and the b genome of the cultivated species. the same results have also been reported by seijo et al.  <cit> . our data fit well with the earlier reports indicating a. duranensis and a. ipaënsis as the most probable diploid progenitors of the cultivated peanut.

genome rearrangements
in this study, the synteny analysis between the a and b genomes revealed inversion of chromosomal segments for at least three lgs, and a particular feature of synteny involving the lgs a <dig>  b <dig>  a <dig> and b <dig> . conservation of synteny between the upper region of lgs a <dig> and b <dig>  and between lg b <dig> and the lower region of lg a <dig> has been pointed out. furthermore, the upper region of lg a <dig> shared also three markers with the lower region of lg a <dig> while lg b <dig> lacked a large chromosomal segment that could correspond to the region of conserved synteny between lgs b <dig> and a <dig>  these observations are consistent with a major translocation event that has occurred between lgs b <dig> and b <dig>  similar feature of synteny conservation between two lgs of the b genome and two lgs of the a genome have also been reported at the diploid level when comparing the a. duranensis × a. stenosperma diploid aa map  <cit>  and the a. ipaënsis × a. magna diploid bb map  <cit> . interestingly, the quadruplet of syntenic lgs in the diploid maps was also found to be syntenic with those in our map . these observations suggest that the rearrangement between lgs b <dig> and b <dig> is an ancient translocation event that happened prior to the tetraploidisation of the cultivated peanut.

chromosome rearrangements, including the inversion of chromosomal segments within pairs of homeologous linkage groups and the conservation of synteny between a triplet of lgs  have also been reported by burow et al.  <cit> . we were not able to identify which lgs of our map are in synteny with those of the burow's map due to the difference of the marker types used in the two studies.

the similarity of the rearrangement events observed in the diploid and the tetraploid maps, which involve different species for a and b genomes, suggests that these evolutionary mechanisms have contributed to the divergence of the a and b genomes of the section arachis. it also raises the question of the classification of the b genome species. the relationships between species with b genome remain controversial. using rflp makers, gimenes et al.  <cit>  reported a clustering of a. batizocoi and a. magna which were less related to a. ipaënsis, while with ssr markers, moretzsohn et al.  <cit>  reported a clustering of the species with b genome including a. batizocoi, a. magna and a. ipaënsis. seijo et al.  <cit>  reported, based on gish, the distinction of a. batizocoi from the other b genome species and concluded that species with b genome do not seem to constitute a natural group.

the results obtained from the comparison of the diploid and tetraploid maps suggest that, based on the similarities of the rearrangement event, the species with b genome a. ipaënsis, a. magna and a. batizocoi could have derived from a common b genome ancestor and could be more closely related than what was previously reported based on molecular makers and on gish. the construction of a consensus molecular genetic map involving the available diploid aa and bb maps and the tetraploid aabb maps as well as the study of crossability between species with b genome should shed new light on this issue.

modifications of parental diploid genome following polyploidization, have been reported . the modifications include structural rearrangements, transposable element activation, difference in gene expression and epigenetic changes. these changes were observed in old polyploid  <cit>  as well as in newly synthesized amphidiploids  <cit> . rapid and dynamic changes in genome structure, including non additive inheritance of genomic fragments and genome-specific sequence deletion have been described in some taxa including brassica  <cit>  and wheat synthetic allotetraploids  <cit> , but not in others including cotton  <cit>  and sugarcane  <cit> . in peanut, burow et al.  <cit>  reported a possible genomic restructuring in the synthetic amphidiploid txag <dig> characterized by 5% of mapped alleles having unknown parental origins. in our study, we utilized a synthetic amphidiploid which had undergone several cycles of self-pollination before crossing with the cultivated allotetraploid. however, to the level of resolution afforded by our experiment, no change in genome structure has been pointed out. further studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness and the level of genomic restructuring in peanut synthetic allotetraploid.

wild segment introgressions and perspectives for the development of interspecific breeding populations
few studies have been reported in the literature regarding the genetic mapping of introgressions from wild to the cultivated peanut. apart from the study of burow et al.  <cit> , introgression mapping of wild segments in the background of a cultivated variety has been reported in  <dig> introgression lines originated from the hybridization between a. cardenasii × a. hypogaea  <cit> . considering all the lines together, introgressed segments could be found on  <dig> of the  <dig> lgs of the a. stenosperma × a. cardenasii diploid aa map  <cit> , and represented 30% of the diploid peanut genome. the mapping of a wild segment from a. cardenasii conferring resistance to root-knot nematode  <cit>  and the registration of two varieties of peanut 'coan'  <cit>  and 'nematam'  <cit> , having identifiable alleles conferring resistance to root-knot nematode transferred from wild species, have also been reported.

in our study, we used a synthetic wild amphidiploid as a mean for the introgression of alien alleles in the genetic background of a cultivated variety and, consequently, enlarging the genetic basis of the cultivated peanut. genetic mapping of the wild introgressed segments gave a clear picture of the amount and the level of coverage of the wild donor genome in the background of the cultivated, and of the segment lengths and their relative decrease from bc1f <dig> to bc2f <dig> generation. the mean length of the wild segments was  <dig>  cm in bc1f <dig> and  <dig>  cm in bc2f <dig>  and the decrease of segment size from bc1f <dig> to bc2f <dig> was about -33%. these values were similar to what was obtained in lycopersicon wild × cultivated backcross populations  <cit> . marker assisted selection of bc1f <dig> and then bc2f <dig> lines carrying the desirable donor segment with the best possible return to the background of the cultivated variety allowed the selection of a limited set of lines that offer an optimal coverage of the wild genome with an overlapping regions between neighbouring lines and an average segment lengths of  <dig>  cm in bc1f <dig> and  <dig>  cm in bc2f <dig>  as well as a 79% return to the background of the cultivated variety in bc2f <dig>  the rapid decrease of wild segment lengths observed between the bc1f <dig> and bc2f <dig> generations as well as the good level of recovery of the genetic background of the cultivated variety in bc2f <dig> generation is of great interest for the genetic mapping of qtls and the development of introgression line  libraries. ils carrying small wild segments in a constant cultivated genetic background have the advantages of reducing epistatic and linkage drag effects and of improving the resolution of qtl mapping  <cit> . furthermore, ils are reliable and stable genetic resources that can be multiplied and evaluated in various environments. many valuable sources of resistance to biotic stresses including resistance to cercospora leafspot  <cit> , to root-knot nematode  <cit> , to peanut bud necrosis virus   <cit> , to late leaf spot disease  <cit>  and sources of tolerance to abiotic stresses including tolerance to thermal stress  <cit>  and to drought  were identified in peanut wild relatives. these sources can be used for genetic improvement in peanut.

the bc1f <dig> and bc2f <dig> populations that we developed are excellent starting points for the development of new breeding populations such as advanced backcross  and chromosome segment substitution lines  populations for analysis of the wild alleles contribution to the improvement of cultivated peanut varieties.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a nearly saturated genetic map has been developed from a cross between the synthetic amphidiploid aiad and the cultivated fleur  <dig> variety. this allowed the synteny analysis of the a and b genomes, the comparison with diploid and tetraploid maps and the analysis of the introgression segments from the most probable wild progenitors of the cultivated peanut into the background of the cultivated fleur  <dig> variety. the results of this study confirmed the close relationship between the wild diploids a. duranensis, a. ipaënsis and the cultivated peanut and highlighted structural rearrangements, such as chromosomal segment inversions and a major translocation event, between the a and b genome species. finally, we showed that the low level of polymorphism reported between cultivated peanut can be overcome by using the wild species. the material we have produced in this study should facilitate the development of ab and cssl breeding populations for the identification and utilization of valuable genes from the largely untapped reservoir of useful alleles that remained in the wild peanut species.
