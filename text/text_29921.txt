BACKGROUND
the increase in the global population, competition of food and biofuel for available land resources, and climate change are all threatening food security. one avenue to alleviate these pressures on our food supply is through better utilization of indigenous or ‘orphan’ crops. these crops have the advantages that they are already well-integrated in the socio-economics of the region, they are the preferred crops for both farmers and consumers, and they provide more stability under rapidly changing environmental conditions and demand. however, they have long been neglected both by commercial breeders and non-profit institutions. tef   is an orphan cereal that is a staple food for over 70% of the  <dig> million people in ethiopia where it grows annually on about  <dig> million hectares of land  <cit> .

tef is a prime candidate for genetic improvement both because of its nutritional and health benefits, and because of its tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, particularly drought and waterlogging. it can be cultivated in a wide range of ecological niches, including semi-arid areas prone to drought where maize, rice and wheat do not survive. while tef is the most important crop in ethiopia, it is gaining in popularity as a life-style food in the developed world because it is gluten-free and high in protein, vitamins, and minerals such as calcium, iron and zinc .

sensitivity to wheat, barley and rye gluten is related to the presence of specific epitopes in the prolamin gene family  <cit> . tef has been proposed as a valuable addition to the diets of celiac patients  <cit>  due to the absence of these epitopes as determined by antibody-based assays  <cit> . in addition, tef contains a high amount of ‘slowly-digestible’ starch conferring it with a low glycemic index  and is considered a suitable food for type  <dig> diabetics  <cit> .

relatively little sequence data are available for tef. a genetic map was constructed from  <dig> recombinant inbred lines   <cit> . this data set includes  <dig> amplifiable simple sequence repeats  of which  <dig> had at least one polymorphism and  <dig> were placed on  <dig> linkage groups. in addition, a collection of  <dig> est sequences also from the kaye murri cultivar are available  <cit> . the homologs of two genes involved in plant height  have been cloned and sequenced for  <dig> cultivars  <cit> .

tef  is an allotetraploid, the result of a genome duplication by hybridization between two diploid progenitors. tef’s closest relatives within the eragrostis genus are thought to be e. pilosa and e. heteromera
 <cit> , although e. aethiopica, e. barrelieri, e. curvula and e. cilianensis may also be involved in the evolution of tef  <cit> . as both e. pilosa and e. heteromera are tetraploid species, the true diploid progenitors of tef remain unknown. the genome size of the tsedey cultivar  sequenced here has been estimated as  <dig> mbp by flow cytometry  <cit> .

whole genome duplication events create another copy of all nuclear genes and regulatory sequences at once, providing redundant gene copies for subsequent selection and adaptation. ancient whole genome duplications are suggested to be associated with adaptive radiations  <cit>  and contemporaneous with extinction events  <cit> , supporting the idea that polyploidy is a driving force of plant evolution. allotetraploidy, in particular, may contribute to the adaptability to novel and extreme environments  <cit>  and may also increase the fitness of the polyploid in a given environment compared to its diploid progenitors  <cit> . as the tef genome is relatively small compared to other polyploid crop species, there is considerable interest in tef as both a model plant for polyploid genome evolution as well as for polyploid sequence assembly and analysis.

the tef improvement project at the university of bern in collaboration with the ethiopian institute of agricultural research has taken the initiative to support the conventional breeding efforts in ethiopia using modern molecular techniques. the overall objective of the project is to provide new cultivars improved in traits such as plant architecture, abiotic stress tolerance, and increased yield to subsistence farmers in ethiopia in a timely manner. the genome and transcriptome sequences reported here reveal genes that have shaped a plant resilient to environmental stresses while also producing nutritious food.

RESULTS
genome sequencing and assembly
the general strategy of the tef genome and transcriptome sequencing, annotation and analysis is shown in figure  <dig>  the early-maturing improved variety of tef, tsedey , was selected for genome sequencing as it can adapt to a wide variety of climates.figure  <dig> 
overview of the tef sequencing project. both the genome and transcriptome of tef were sequenced, annotated, analyzed and verified. the genome was assembled using soapdenovo and was then analyzed for transposable elements using windowmasker, repeatmasker and trep. non-coding rnas were found with infernal with the rfam dataset and genes were predicted using the evidence combiner, maker. one normalized transcriptome library was produced using  <dig> pyrosequencing, assembled using newbler and the genes predicted using estscan. another transcriptome was produced using rnaseq data collected from tef seedlings subjected to various moisture regimes. the sequences were assembled using both trinity and oases/velvet and the coding regions predicted using estscan.



homoeologous genomes in polyploids such as tef have high levels of sequence identity that present enormous challenges to assembly. currently available genome assemblers are not designed to assemble polyploids and the resulting assemblies are often fragmented  <cit> , chimeric  <cit>  and/or contain false segmental duplications  <cit> .

often, strategies are applied to reduce the ploidy of the genome in order to simplify the assembly process. these include sequencing the diploid progenitors of a polyploid as was done for tobacco  <cit>  and cotton  <cit> , obtaining a haploid   <cit>  or generating a doubled haploid. in plants, generating a double haploid can be done by producing a haploid genome from pollen or seeds and then doubling it to form a homozygous diploid, as done for the potato  <cit> . alternatively, bac libraries can be used to sequence and assemble the entire genome although this is time consuming and expensive.

our attempts at obtaining a haploid tef for sequencing were unsuccessful. hence, we sequenced allotetraploid tissue and expected to find a mixture of the a and b genomes. multiple sequence alignments between the homeologous tef scaffolds and the few sanger sequences for which we have both an a and a b copy do show some chimerism, for example, the ko <dig> gene . however, the homeolog specificity is intact for large regions of the genes. a two-stage assembly strategy has been successful in separating homeologous sequences from the three genomes of wheat and could be applied to separate the homeologs for regions in which homeolog specificity is required  <cit> .

we generated a total of  <dig> gbp from single- and paired-end reads resulting in 44-fold coverage with illumina hiseq <dig> and seven-fold coverage with 454-flx pyrosequencing. the libraries had insert sizes of 300 bp, 3 kb,  <dig>  kb and 13 kb . the illumina and the single-end 454-flx sequences were assembled into contigs using soapdenovo  <cit> . the paired-end and mate-pair illumina and 454-flx sequences were then used to link the contigs into scaffolds. gapcloser from soapdenovo was then used to close the gaps in the assembly. the assemblies were performed with k-mer values of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and the assembly with k-mer value  <dig> was chosen based on assembly statistics and the presence of known sequences.

approximately 80% of the tef genome was represented in scaffolds greater than 1000 bp. around half of the tef genome was contained in the  <dig> scaffolds that were aligned to sorghum following the requirement that at least three syntenic genes be identified. re-sequencing the tef genome using advanced sequencing technologies with long reads such as pacific biosystems rs ii technology and illumina’s moleculo will contribute to the further improvement of the current assembly.

transcriptome sequencing and assembly
a normalized transcriptome library prepared from roots and shoots of tef seedlings generated a total of  <dig> mbp of sequence reads using the 454-flx technology . the reads were assembled with newbler  <cit>  and resulted in a transcriptome  with  <dig> gene clusters and  <dig> transcripts .

a second non-normalized library was obtained from various tef tissues subjected to drought and water-logging for the purpose of determining expression. it was then sequenced with the illumina highseq  <dig> to obtain  <dig> gbp after trimming. the reads were assembled using trinity  <cit>  and oases/velvet  <cit> . these two assemblies were combined with the 454isotigs and then clustered with tgicl, resulting in the ‘extended’ transcriptome containing  <dig> gene clusters and  <dig> transcripts. thus the two assemblies revealed substantial differences in the numbers of transcripts but similar numbers of gene clusters.

the large variation in the numbers of transcripts generated from the two assemblies stems from differences in the sequencing data and assembly procedures used. the 454isotigs transcriptome was created from a normalized library using the newbler assembler on long reads. on the other hand, the extended database was constructed from merging three datasets, the 454isotigs, a trinity assembly made from short read data and an oases/velvet assembly made from short read data, a procedure which created much redundancy. to decrease the redundancy, the resulting transcripts were clustered with tgicl producing the  <dig>  transcripts. interestingly, this approach was also recently used by nakasugi et al.
 <cit>  who concluded that it is advantageous to combine the output from many different de novo assemblers. a disadvantage is that this procedure increases the probability of chimeric sequences. the distribution of sequence lengths in the extended dataset has longer sequences than that of the 454isotigs and is closer to the distribution of sequence lengths in sorghum and to the genomic predictions . while 99% of the 454isotigs transcripts can be found in the extended dataset, only 72% of the extended can be found in the 454isotigs . the number of clusters is remarkably similar between the two data sets and sorghum.

genome quality assessment
assembly statistics show that the quality of the tef genome is comparable to that of foxtail millet   <cit>  and other recently reported genomes  . the assembled tef genome has a size of  <dig> mbp, equivalent to 87% of the estimated size of the sequenced genotype  <cit> . the distribution of k-mer frequencies was estimated with jellyfish  <cit>  using 100 bp reads from the 300 bp insert-size library. k-mer statistics were used to estimate the genome size and varied from  <dig> to  <dig> mbp depending on the value of k   <cit> . the number of scaffolds greater than 1000 bp in size was  <dig> and the scaffold n <dig> was  <dig>  the percentages of reads mapped to genomic scaffolds greater than 1000 bp in length are compared in additional file 2: table s <dig>  of the single reads, 84% could be mapped back onto scaffolds. for the 300 bp insert-size library, an average of 74% was mapped with the proper paired-end relationship.

to assess the quality of the genome, four sets of known tef sequences were sought in the genome. first, of the  <dig> pairs of primers reported for ssr genetic markers  <cit> , 77% were found in the current genome with a distance between them comparable to that expected . second, as described in additional file 2: note  <dig>  two regions, one approximately  <dig> kbp and the other approximately  <dig> kbp, were amplified, sequenced with the sanger method and aligned to the genome. percentage identities of  <dig> and 97%, respectively, were obtained for the two constructs . third, from our previous efforts at genetic improvement, complete or partial sequences of several genes were made by sanger sequencing. all of the genes and more than 92% of the bases in the genes totaling  <dig> kbp were found in the draft genome . fourth, of the  <dig> tef ests available in the ncbi database, approximately 99% were found. therefore, the content of the draft genome is sufficient for the intended application to genetic improvement.

transcriptome quality assessment
the distribution of lengths of proteins predicted from the extended and the 454isotigs transcriptomes were compared to that of sorghum . while the distribution of protein lengths predicted from the 454isotigs appears to be skewed toward shorter proteins, the distribution of protein lengths of the extended dataset is similar to that of sorghum. in addition, the transcriptomes of the 454isotigs and the extended were compared to each other and to the sequenced sorghum genome  <cit> . the percentage of genes and bases aligned are tabulated in additional file 2: table s <dig>  for each transcriptome, approximately 99% of the genes had at least a partial hit in the tef genome while 96-99% of the bases in the transcriptomes could be aligned to the genome. over 90% of the sorghum genes had at least a partial match in the tef genome but many sequences were incomplete or substantially different as the number of bases of sorghum genes aligned to tef was less than 60%. the 454isotigs appeared to be a subset of the extended transcriptome as almost all of the 454isotigs were found in the extended set while only 23% of the latter were present in the 454isotigs.

comparison to other grasses
tef belongs to the grass family poaceae which includes all cereal crops, and to the subfamily chloridoideae and is the first sequenced member of this subfamily. the evolutionary relationships between the grasses are shown by the phylogenetic tree constructed from the waxy gene . the closest cultivated species to tef is finger millet , the genome of which is not yet sequenced. the closest subfamily to the chloridoideae is the subfamily panicoideae that includes sorghum  and maize . a phylogenetic tree constructed from orthologous genes between the five grasses which have been heretofore sequenced shows the evolutionary distances between the grasses . of the sequenced genomes, the closest to tef are foxtail millet  and sorghum bicolor.figure  <dig> 
phylogenetic tree for selected cereals from the grass  family including tef . a) partial sequences of the waxy gene from barley , bread wheat , finger millet , foxtail millet , maize , paspalum simplex , pearl millet , proso millet , rice , sorghum , and tef  were obtained from the ncbi database. the maximum likelihood tree was inferred using phyml and the default model of hky85 + g. the scale bar reflects evolutionary distance, measured in units of substitution per nucleotide site. branch support was inferred using the shimodaira–hasegawa-like  alrt provided by phyml. b) phylogenetic tree of the complete grass genomes. protein supergenes with an aligned length of  <dig> amino acids and constructed from orthologous sequences were used to infer a maximum-likelihood tree using phyml with the wag substitution matrix and a gamma model with four classes and an alpha parameter value estimated to be  <dig> . branch lengths reflect the estimated number of amino acid substitutions per site. ml bootstrap values were all 100%.



the tef genome and the genes predicted in the genome from the maker genome annotation pipeline combiner  <cit>  were uploaded to coge  <cit> , a platform containing a wealth of genomes and providing interfaces to numerous tools for genome alignment, comparison, and visualization. coge’s tool synmap  <cit>  identifies orthologous genes between two genomes using sequence homology and synteny. synmap was used to identify syntenic tef scaffolds with at least five  genes having a collinear genomic relationship to sorghum genes  <cit> . alignment of these scaffolds to the  <dig> sorghum chromosomes produced  <dig> artificial tef ‘pseudo-chromosomes’. a total of  <dig> scaffolds containing approximately  <dig> mbp were ordered by this alignment of tef scaffolds to sorghum chromosomes . these pseudo-chromosomes were constructed from a mixture of the a and b genomes with the two homeologous scaffolds close to each other in the tef pseudo-chromosome. the scaffolds aligning to each sorghum chromosome were further sorted into a and b pseudo-chromosomes, by sequentially placing them into two groups based on overlap. the first scaffold was placed in a, if the next scaffold had more than a 75% overlap with one in a, it was put in b. this was then repeated for all scaffolds in order, resulting in random placement of each scaffold into the a and b pseudo-chromosomes. dotplots  <cit>  of the a and b pseudo-chromosome show that they are homologous over large areas and also show the potential of syntenic mapping in sorting polyploid genome assemblies . a more sophisticated algorithm to identify which scaffolds belong to the a and b genomes is under investigation.figure  <dig> 
comparison of tef to other grasses. a) syntenic dotplot between tef scaffolds  and sorghum chromosomes  produced by coge. scaffolds of tef have been ordered and oriented based on synteny to sorghum  and joined to create a pseudo-assembly. each dots represents a syntenic gene pair between tef and sorghum. for each sorghum position, two tef scaffolds, one from the a genome and one from the b genome, are expected. the sinusoidal shape is a result of very few tef scaffolds aligning to the gene-poor centromeric regions of sorghum. b) tef pseudo-chromosomes were then sorted into tef a and tef b pseudo-chromosomes. a dot plot of the 1a and 1b pseudo-chromosomes shows the correspondence between the a and b pseudo-chromosomes. c) the distributions of pairwise synonymous substitutions per synonymous site estimated between tef and other genomes. the corresponding dates can be found in additional file 5: table s <dig>  d) histogram of synonymous rate values  for all syntenic gene-pairs within the tef and within the maize genomes. the dates estimated from modes of the peaks using a molecular clock rate of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> substitutions per synonymous site per year can be found in additional file 5: table s <dig> 



genetic maps show the relative positions of loci with a distance based on the amount of recombination between them and are developed through markers which sort together based on phenotype. physical maps give the distance between any two loci in units of base pairs. establishing the relationship between the genetic and physical maps reveals the location of and distance between genes that are recombining together.

the available genetic map consists of  <dig> linkage groups instead of the  <dig> expected based on the chromosome number because there are not enough markers to join all of the linkage groups into chromosomes. by connecting the physical and genetic maps, we can establish which linkage groups correspond to each chromosome and which linkage groups are homeologous. the tef genome is not assembled into the  <dig> chromosomes so the pseudo-chromosomes created by mapping to sorghum were aligned to the genetic map of tef and used to suggest a putative order of the linkage groups  <cit>  . for example, it can be seen that linkage groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> all map to tef pseudo-chromosome number  <dig>  while linkage groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> all map to pseudo-chromosome number  <dig>  these could either be homeologous linkage groups or linkage groups that did not have enough markers recombining together to be joined.figure  <dig> 
relationship between tef genetic map and tef pseudo-chromosomes. the  <dig> linkage groups from the genetic map of zeid et al. are depicted in yellow with labels corresponding to the location of their cnlt ssr markers. the ten tef pseudo-chromosomes are colored in various colors with colored lines connecting the physical location of each cnlt marker on the tef pseudo-chromosomes to its location on the genetic map. lines depicting mapping of genetic markers to tef pseudo-chromosomes are shown with the color of the pseudo-chromosome with the most overlap. the linkage groups of the genetic map have been ordered to minimize overlap of the connections and thus indicate which of the  <dig> linkage groups are homeologous. a translocation between sorghum and tef can be seen between linkage group  <dig> and tef pseudo-chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  the units of the tef pseudo-chromosomes are mbp.



inversions and translocations between the tef and sorghum genomes could be seen such as the chromosomal translocation between tef linkage group  <dig> and tef pseudo-chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> as well as an inversion between linkage group  <dig> and  <dig> that correspond to pseudo-chromosome  <dig>  the physical distance and genetic distance were compared for  <dig> marker pairs and ranged between  <dig>  and 15 cm/mbp . the variation in the estimates might be related to the sparsely covered genetic map or because of differences in tef recombination rates.

identification of the set of orthologous genes between two genomes enabled genome-wide comparisons. codeml of paml  <cit>  is integrated into coge. codeml is a program for the reconstruction of ancestral sequences using a collection of codon models which in turn allows estimation of synonymous  and non-synonymous  substitution rates over trees, branches or sites. the ratio of ka to ks is useful for the detection of selection in protein-coding dna sequences while ks alone can be used as a molecular clock. coge first identifies orthologous genes based on collinearity and then returns ka and ks values for the complete set of orthologous genes between two genomes. the ks distribution between two genomes can be used to estimate the divergence date between the two species; the mode of the distribution represents either a speciation or duplication event. the divergence date corresponding to the mode can then be estimated using a substitution rate, for plants a substitution rate of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> synonymous substitutions per synonymous site per year has been proposed  <cit> .

the synmap function of coge was used to do pairwise comparisons of the following genomes: eragrostis tef , sorghum bicolor , zea mays , oryza sativa japonica  and setaria italica  . from the mode of the distribution at  <dig>  substitutions per site, the divergence date between sorghum and tef was estimated to be around  <dig> million years ago . all genome-wise estimates of ks between tef and other poaceae are in additional file 5: table s <dig> and are comparable to those found by smith et al.
 <cit> .

allotetraploidy
tef is an allotetraploid, the result of genome duplication by hybridization between two diploid progenitors. the whole genome duplication of tef is relatively recent in the history of the grasses and therefore it provides a unique snapshot into the consequences of such an event at this time point.

whole genome duplications in grasses can be revealed by the distribution of ks values within a genome. if a genome has undergone a recent whole genome duplication, the distribution of ks values computed between the genome and itself will show a peak whose ks value is an estimate of the evolutionary distance between the homeologs. in order to determine the evolutionary distance between the two sub-genomes in the grasses, the distribution of ks values between homeologous genes within each genome was computed using coge. maize and tef had evident peaks corresponding to recent whole genome duplications while the other grasses did not . the mode of the tef ks distribution was  <dig>  substitutions per codon, while that of the maize distribution was  <dig> , corresponding to genome duplications for tef and maize occurring approximately  <dig> and  <dig> mya, respectively, using a substitution rate of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> synonymous substitutions per synonymous site per year  <cit>  . these divergence dates are in agreement with previous estimates for tef  <cit>  and maize  <cit> . a small broad peak centered around  <dig>  substitutions per site is present in all genomes and corresponds to the rho whole genome duplication, a duplication that occurred prior to the divergence of the grasses  <cit> .

alignment of the tef a and b pseudo-chromosomes showed that the average sequence identity between the aligned nucleotides of the a and b pseudo-chromosomes over the entire genome was 93% not counting the frequent indels . eight genomic sequences for which sanger sequences were available for both homeologous copies had an average of 96% sequence identity in the coding region and 82% in the non-coding region .

in addition, as there are two homoeologs expected for each gene in the genome, two copies of each transcript of the 454isotigs and the extended transcriptomes were sought in the genome. statistics were tabulated for longest aligning copy, ‘copy 1’ and the second-longest aligning copy, ‘copy 2’ . for the 454isotigs, 96% of the transcripts were found and 86% of the transcripts had a second copy, indicating that the majority of the genes are present with two copies.

discovery of novel ssr markers
simple sequence repeats  or microsatellites are sequences of 2– <dig> nucleotides that repeat from  <dig> to  <dig> times. they are highly polymorphic and therefore often used as molecular markers for breeding indigenous crops such as tef. although high-throughput sequencing of snps for genetic markers is becoming more commonplace, ssr markers are still important for breeding in the developing world. marker-assisted breeding depends on the natural variation in the population. of the  <dig> pairs of primers reported for ssr markers in tef  <cit> , only 77% were found in the current genome mainly due to its source. the ssr markers were developed from ests which represent only the transcribed regions while the genome sequence contains both transcribed and non-transcribed regions. hence, the primer sequence of an ssr marker might be split into two places in the genome due to the presence of an intron. these divided markers would not be detected in the genome. markers could also be missing from the genome either because they were not sequenced or because of natural variation between the different tef cultivars used for sequencing.

about  <dig> ssr repeats  or about one every  <dig> bases were found in the tef genome  using misa  <cit> . misa is a tool developed to systematically search for ssrmotifs. perl scripts provided on the misa website to interface misa with primer <dig>  <cit>  were used to design primers for all ssrs with repeat size of three or more . several ssrs having a close proximity to a gene cluster controlling yield or drought on the genetic map  <cit>  but not in coding regions were chosen for pcr amplification. to maximize the chance of polymorphisms, the ssrs were chosen to be in noncoding regions.

a novel ssr located near known markers on linkage group  <dig> was found to have differences between the alba and tsedey cultivars of tef, and was further investigated . approximately 200 bp surrounding the ssr was sequenced for  <dig> tef cultivars  as well as four wild eragrostis species . the genotypes were variable at  <dig> positions including indels. addisie, beten, gommadie, kaye murri, magna, rosea, tsedey and variegata shared the same number of repeats of the ctcct motif while ada, alba, balami, dabbi, dukem, enatite, gea lammie, karadebi, manyi, quncho, red dabbi and tullu nasy, had one less . in addition, tullu nasy, alba and balami share an indel. of the wild species, e. pilosa and e. minor had two fewer instances of the repeat while e. curvula and e. trichodes had three fewer occurrences. the sequence alignment and the most parsimonious phylogenetic tree based on all variable positions support these relationships and place the gommadie and kaye murri ecotypes, which both have a semi-compact panicle, to the same group . a parsimony tree with the same score could be obtained by putting e. minor in the same clade as e. pilosa a to the exclusion of e. pilosa b.

discovery of a novel ssr marker indicates that the genome has applications in marker-assisted breeding. this new marker was located on scaffold <dig> at position  <dig> only  <dig> kbp from the rht <dig>  gene responsible for semi-dwarf stature in wheat and rice  <cit> . it separates  <dig> tef genotypes with diverse agronomic and morphological traits  <cit>  and four closely related wild eragrostis species into two groups, while other polymorphisms in the surrounding sequence further divide the groups. the phylogenetic relationship between several natural accessions as well as two improved varieties could be determined from sequencing the locus around the ssr. among the four improved varieties, two  were developed via widely practiced selection procedures while the other two  were developed through introgressions between improved tef cultivars. a cross between the high-yielding dukem variety and the white-seeded magna variety produced quncho, the most popular variety in ethiopia  <cit> . for the region sequenced here, the quncho sequence is identical to that of the parent dukem and not the parent magna. although most of the polymorphisms occur between the different eragrostis species, the tef natural accessions kaye murri and ada also have point mutations.

genome annotation and analysis
genes were predicted in the genome using the maker evidence combiner  <cit> . over 92% of the predicted genes were supported by the extended transcriptome. the distribution of gene lengths of the predicted genes was consistent with that of the sorghum genome . annotation was performed with the swiss institute of bioinformatic’s praise annotation system, designed to use manually curated rules to combine annotation from different sources . the numbers of entries with various annotations for the different datasets can be found in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

using windowmasker with the default settings, 14% of the genome was masked  which is substantially lower than that expected from other grasses such as sorghum with ~ 61%  <cit> . repeatmasker using the trep database  <cit>  as input found only 6% of the draft genome to be transposable elements,  <dig> % retroelements  and 2% dna transposons . the number of repeat elements found was small but given the genome assembly procedure used, it is expected that the number of repeats is greatly reduced due to collapsed sequence assemblies  <cit> . infernal  <cit>  with the rfam database  <cit>  identified  <dig> rrnas ,  <dig> trnas ,  <dig> mirnas  and  <dig> snrnas   <cit> .table  <dig>

miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements  are a special type of class ii non-autonomous transposable elements  that are abundant in the non-coding regions of the genes of many plant and animal species  <cit> . the number of mites found in the tef genome is  <dig> which is  <dig> % of the genome size . around  <dig> mites were identified in sorghum, comprising  <dig> % of the genome  <cit>  while oki et al.
 <cit>  reported  <dig> mites in rice, comprising  <dig> % of the genome.

abiotic stress related genes in tef
although tef is relatively drought tolerant, moisture scarcity is among the major yield limiting factors in tef production  <cit>  and severe drought remains a critical problem for ethiopia  <cit> . one of the goals of the tef improvement project is to identify genes involved in tef’s abiotic stress tolerance, in particular those for drought-tolerance, and to use them to develop more drought-tolerant cultivars. tolerances to abiotic stresses such as tolerance to drought, salt, and water-logging are complex traits controlled by many genes. access to the genomic sequence of tef enables the transfer of knowledge of these genes gained from well-studied crops like maize and rice to the application of molecular-supported breeding efforts in tef. in addition, the tef genome provides a new pool of abiotic stress target genes.

twenty-six arabidopsis, rice and sorghum genes known to be involved in abiotic stress response were investigated by aligning each query sequence to the tef genomic sequences . two homeologs were sought in tef. for comparison, they were also aligned to the sorghum and foxtail millet genomes. all of the genes were found at least partially in all genomes. the percentage of query sequence nucleotides aligned to the tef genome differed for each gene and ranged from  <dig> to 100%. these percentages were similar to those found in foxtail millet. the percentages of the query sequences aligned to sorghum were higher than both tef and foxtail millet, not surprising given that some of the query sequences were from sorghum and that the quality of the sorghum genome is higher. for  <dig> of the  <dig> genes investigated, two homeologs were found in tef.

one of the goals of this project is to identify molecular breeding targets. to investigate which genes might have special adaptations in tef, gene families that have undergone expansion or contraction were sought as this might provide some clues to the adaptation of tef to extreme climatic conditions in general and specifically to drought tolerance. for this reason, the number of family members for each of these genes was counted in tef and the other grasses and tabulated .

among these genes known to be involved in drought tolerance in several plant species, we have singled out the sal <dig> gene which is involved in abiotic stress tolerance in both monocts and dicots. mutants with down-regulated or inactivated sal <dig> genes have been found to have an increased drought tolerance in arabidopsis
 <cit>  and wheat  <cit> . from additional file 2: table s <dig>  sal <dig> was also identified as a family in which gene duplication may play a role in the drought response of tef. for these reasons, sal <dig> was chosen for detailed analysis.

family members of the sal <dig> gene were identified by using homology searching of the sorghum sal <dig> gene in the genomes of five grasses. seven copies or partial copies of the sal <dig> gene were found in tef compared to 1– <dig> in the other grasses investigated . the phylogenetic relationship of the members of the sal <dig> family is shown in figure 5a. two gene subfamilies are present, probably the result of a tandem duplication which took place before the divergence of the grasses. both copies have been retained by all grasses with the exception of brachypodium for which only one copy was found. for tef, in addition to a second homologous copy, it appears that the entire region has been duplicated yet another time as this sequence of genes appears in three scaffolds in its entirety . in addition, on scaffold <dig>  sal <dig> appears as a tandem triplicate  indicating further gene duplication in this family. the presence of this particular tandem triplication was confirmed by designing several sets of pcr primers in the region spanning  <dig>  kb and sequencing the pcr products using the sanger method. as shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  all three sal <dig> tandem genes identified in the scaffold are present in the tef genome.analysis of dn/ds values identified no branches of the tree evolving under positive selection. the distribution of ds values between the members of the sal <dig> family examined shows a peak at  <dig>  substitutions per codon which reflects the distance between the two subfamilies that have been diverging since the original duplication . a peak around  <dig>  substitutions per codon reflects the speciation between the most distant members of each subfamily. the smallest ds value of  <dig>  was located between et <dig>  and et <dig> indicating either a recent duplication or gene conversion. the ds value between et <dig>  and et <dig>  indicates that this is the most recent duplication of the triplication on scaffold <dig> figure  <dig> 
sal <dig> gene in tef and other grasses. a) the sal <dig> gene duplicated before the divergence of the grasses and has also undergone several recent duplications in one branch of the phylogenetic tree. the ml tree was constructed using the wag protein substitution model implemented in phyml . branch support was inferred using the conservative and non-parametric shimodaira–hasegawa-like  alrt provided by phyml. only branch support values less than  <dig>  are shown. abbreviations: et: eragrostis tef; sb: sorghum bicolor; os: oryza sativa; bradi: brachypodium distachyon; si: setaria italica.
b) comparison of orthologous syntenic genomic regions between tef, sorghum, and setaria. the sal <dig> gene appears on three scaffolds in the tef genome, twice as tandem duplicates and once as a tandem triplicate and is found as a tandem duplicate in rice, setaria and sorghum. orange blocks indicate unsequenced regions created from the scaffolding. c) distribution of ks values for all pairwise comparisons of sal <dig> gene family members.



in addition to the sal <dig> gene, several other genes known to be involved in abiotic stress tolerance have been identified as potential targets for improvement by observing changes in the number of family members both in the genome and transcriptome constructed separately from the control, drought and waterlogged rnaseq samples. these included b-glucanase  <cit> , sgr  <cit>  and erd <dig>  <cit> , all involved in the response to drought . these potential candidates will be the next targets investigated in the laboratory.

prolamin family genes related to gluten sensitivity
celiac disease in humans is caused by an immune response to specific amino acid sequences, called epitopes, that are present in wheat, barley and rye gluten. the family of genes responsible is the prolamin gene family  <cit> . antibody-based assays have shown that tef does not contain the offending epitopes  <cit> . possession of the genomic sequence allows for confirmation of these assays. a comprehensive search of all wheat, barley and rye epitopes causing immune reactions in celiac patients resulted in  <dig> epitopes that stimulate t-cells  <cit> . these 11-, 12-, 13-, 16- and 20- amino acid-long epitopes were sought in tef, brachypodium, barley, rice, maize, setaria and sorghum genomes as well as the wheat and rye sequences at ncbi. none of these epitopes were found outside of the wheat, barley or rye genome  confirming that rice, maize, sorghum and tef products may be safely consumed by celiac patients.

prolamin genes were sought in the tef genome by using blast  <cit>  to search for homologs to grass prolamin protein sequences described by xu and messing  <cit> . in the tef genome,  <dig> sequences were found , often as tandem duplicates, with the majority being located on tef pseudo-chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  many of the genes were found to have stop codons or frame shifts. two were expressed either in the transcriptome or in mass spectrometry analysis of tef  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
phylogenetic tree of prolamins in grasses. the protein sequences included in the analysis follow those of xu and messing  <cit>  with the addition of tef sequences from this work. the repeat regions were edited out of all sequences which were then aligned using mafft. the ml tree was constructed using the wag protein substitution model implemented in phyml . the gamma shape parameter was fit to  <dig>  and the proportion of invariant sites was estimated to be  <dig>  branch support was inferred using the conservative and non-parametric shimodaira–hasegawa-like  alrt provided by phyml. only branch support values less than  <dig>  are shown. the tree is represented here by a cladogram so there are no meaningful branch lengths. expressed tef sequences are in blue, tef sequences with a lesion  are green and the remaining tef sequences are red. the grasses included are: bd: brachypodium distachyon; cl: coix lacryma; et: eragrostis tef; hv: hordeum vulgare; os: oryza sativa; ps: panicum sumatrense; sb: sorghum bicolor; sc: secale cereale; si: setaria italica; so: saccharum officinarum; ta: triticum aestivum; tc: triticum compactum; zm: zea mays.



as detailed in xu and messing  <cit>  grass prolamins fall into three groups. group one includes alpha- and delta- prolamins. alpha prolamins are present in the panicoideae  but not rice or pooideae . they are the youngest family of prolamins and thought to have originated from delta prolamins. one copy of tef alpha prolamin was found in both the genome  and the transcriptome , indicating that it is being expressed . the majority of the genomic copies found in the tef genome are delta prolamins including one expressed in our transcriptome studies . the delta group includes a tandem triplication on scaffold <dig> as well as a tandem duplication on scaffold <dig> 

group two of the prolamins, the largest group, contains gamma and beta zeins/kefarins in maize and sorghum as well as the s-rich prolamins . one genomic copy of a beta-like tef sequence and one genomic copy of a gamma-like tef sequence were found. for this group, the pooideae cluster together as do sorghum, maize and tef.

group three, comprised of prolamins only found in pooideae, is more closely related to alpha-globulins  than to other prolamins. tandem duplicates of two alpha-globulin genes were found on scaffold <dig> and scaffold <dig>  both located on tef pseudo-chromosome  <dig> 

the only tef prolamin sequences found in the literature were produced by tatham et al.
 <cit>  who identified and isolated tef prolamin sequences using sds-page and hplc. six peaks were resolved with hplc, for two of them , the first  <dig> amino acids were sequenced. they concluded that both tef <dig> and tef <dig> were alpha prolamins based on the high similarity of their amino acid compositions to the amino acid composition of the alpha-prolamins of maize. the sequence of tef <dig>  similar to scaffold <dig>  is found in the transcriptome as isotig <dig> and appears to be an alpha prolamin. the  <dig> amino acids of tatham’s peptide tef <dig> were found several times in the tef genome; the locations are tabulated in additional file 2: table s <dig>  however, no prolamin genes were found in these regions when searching for homology with members of the prolamin family. therefore the full sequence and status of tef <dig> remain unknown. the  <dig> amino acids of tef <dig> were also not found in the transcriptome.

both the tef and the finger millet sequences had n-terminal deletions compared to zeins as is the case with many of the tef sequences found in this analysis. surprising is the large amount of duplication that has occurred in the delta prolamins of tef. seed tissue was not included in the sequencing library; therefore, it is uncertain if all of the expressed genes have been detected.

CONCLUSIONS
the genome sequence of tef, an indigenous and economically important cereal crop in the horn of africa, is a valuable resource for comparative and functional genomic studies of grasses, particularly for abiotic stress tolerance and healthy nutrition for which tef can be considered as model plant. in general, the genome of tef provides a molecular basis for improvement techniques that will provide new cultivars for subsistence farmers in ethiopia. furthermore, the genome sequence of tef is a starting point for the exploration of the genetic diversity in tef natural accessions and mutagenized populations. it paves the way for the application of modern techniques such as ecotilling, genome wide association studies , genotyping by sequencing  and rnaseq in harnessing the rich natural variation present in the tef germplasm.
