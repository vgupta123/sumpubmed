BACKGROUND
duplicated genes have been suggested to be the raw material for the evolution of new functions and important players in adaptive evolution  <cit> . genomes are constantly subject to rearrangements, by both whole genome duplication  and small-scale genome duplication , where tandemly duplicated genes  are a common case of ssd which generate clusters of physically linked genes. the genomes of angiosperms  are of particular interest to study the impact of gene duplication. compared to mammals and even to most other plant genomes, angiosperms undergo wgds, recombination, and retrotransposition more frequently; as a consequence, they also display a larger range of genome sizes and chromosome numbers  <cit> . most angiosperm genomes sequenced so far show evidence for at least one  wgd event during their evolution . the importance of tdgs has also been shown in oryza sativa  and arabidopsis thaliana where tdgs comprise 15-20% of all coding genes  <cit> . using genomic and expression data in plants, hanada et al. <cit>  showed that tdgs tend to be involved in response to environmental stimuli and are enriched in genes up-regulated under biotic stress. this suggests that tdgs play an important role in adaptation of plants to changing environments  <cit> . taken together, these findings demonstrate the dynamic nature of angiosperm genomes and raise the question of the impact of gene duplications on plant adaptation.

gene duplication creates an unstable state of functional redundancy, which in most cases will disappear by loss of one copy through accumulation of degenerative mutations, recombination and/or genetic drift. but sometimes both copies are long-term preserved due to functional changes reducing their redundancy and making the loss of one copy disadvantageous  <cit> . although the respective roles of adaptive versus non-adaptive processes in the maintenance of gene duplicates have been much debated , gene duplication should increase the occurrence of adaptation for several reasons. first, it can allow the fixation of beneficial mutations on one copy, leading to neofunctionalization, while the other copy ensures the ancestral function  <cit> . second, it can free the genome from an “adaptive conflict” if the different functions of an ancestral  gene cannot be improved independently  <cit> . third, even when adaptation is not involved in the initial conservation of duplicates, the presence of two  copies is expected to increase the adaptation rate under certain conditions. duplication increases the number of gene copies, hence the rate of appearance of beneficial mutations. otto & whitton  <cit>  showed that if beneficial mutations are dominant or partly dominant, the rate of adaptation should increase with copy number . if concerted evolution among gene copies is taken into account, mano & innan  <cit>  showed that gene conversion  increases the effective population size of gene families proportionally to the number of gene members, thus increasing the efficacy of weak selection. their model predicts that the rate of adaptive substitutions increases with the number of gene copies. overall we thus expect higher rates of adaptive evolution in multigene families than in single-copy genes.

as a result of the complex histories of duplicated genes, the retention rate  varies according to several factors including time since the duplication event, protein function, or duplication mode  <cit> . these variations in retention rates have direct consequences on gene family organization and evolution. reconciliation methods exploit the observed discrepancies between gene family trees and species trees to infer gene duplication, gene transfer, and gene loss . among other things, reconciliation methods can be used to estimate duplication or transfer rates and to predict sequence orthology   <cit> . using this method, the extreme heterogeneity of duplication/retention rates among taxa and gene families and/or subfamilies was demonstrated . in particular, reconciliation allows for identification of cases in which recurrent events of duplications  are specific of some lineages and create clades of paralogs  in phylogenetic trees . note that since only retained duplications are observable, it is hard to estimate duplication and retention rates independently; hence our use of the “duplication/retention rate” terminology.

lineage specific duplications/retentions are of particular interest because the recurrence of such events in the same lineage and in a short period of evolutionary time raises the question of their adaptive role to an even greater extent. to test the hypothesis that lineage specific expansion  of gene families enhances adaptation we compared positive  selection footprints in lineages containing recent and specific duplicated genes to reference lineages containing only single-copy genes. one way to detect positive selection is by analyzing nucleotide substitution patterns at the codon level in a phylogenetic framework. nucleotide substitutions can either be nonsynonymous  or synonymous . the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio, denoted as dn/ds or ω, can be used to infer the direction and strength of natural selection. if no selection is acting, ω should equal  <dig>  an ω value smaller than  <dig> indicates an under-representation of nonsynonymous substitutions, which can be interpreted as the preferential elimination of deleterious mutations by purifying selection. the closer ω is to zero, the stronger purifying selection is acting. on the other hand, if ω is larger than  <dig> it indicates an over-representation of nonsynonymous substitutions, which can be interpreted as positive selection on new variants. using such an approach, positive selection has been detected for mads-box transcription factors  <cit> , monosaccharide transporters  <cit> , genes involved in a triterpene pathway  <cit> , an anthocyanin pathway enzyme encoding gene  <cit> , and epimerase genes  <cit>  to mention only a few examples in plants. so far, this approach has mostly been applied to single candidate gene families. thanks to the availability of numerous completely sequenced plant genomes, it can now be used at the genome level for several angiosperm species.

the dynamic nature of angiosperm genomes makes them an ideal system to study the link between gene duplication/retention rate heterogeneity and adaptation. assuming that adaptation is acting when positive selection footprints are detected, we want to test if positive selection can be observed more frequently in lse genes compared to single-copy genes. we applied a dn/ds-based test to detect positive selection as it is easy to use on a large scale, it is one of the most stringent tests  <cit> , and it has been applied successfully in many similar cases . using this approach, we found  <dig> % of codons under positive selection in lse gene families but none in single-copy ones. in addition, the average ω over branches of lse gene trees is almost twice as high as that observed in single-copy gene trees. we also found a much higher proportion of branches under positive selection and/or relaxed constraint among lse gene trees than among single-copy gene trees. taken together, these results strongly support the prediction that  lse gene evolution plays an important role in adaptation whereas very few single-copy genes seem to be involved.

RESULTS
dataset description
we investigated whole genomes of five monocots  and five dicots . from the greenphyl database  <cit>  we extracted ultraparalog clusters  which represent our lse gene set. as a single-copy gene reference, we chose a superortholog gene set . to address the question of whether or not positive selection is more frequent during lse events, we compared the results obtained on ups with those obtained on so gene sets. the so gene set was then divided in two subsets. the first one, so <dig>  contains so genes extracted from greenphyl protein trees in which at least one up cluster was also identified. this means that all the trees from which an so <dig> was extracted contain at least one up cluster. the second so set  is the complement of so <dig>  i.e. it is composed of so genes extracted from greenphyl trees in which no up clusters were found. likewise, the up <dig> dataset represents up clusters extracted from greenphyl trees also containing so clusters and the up <dig> dataset represents up clusters from greenphyl trees from which no so clusters were extracted. we subdivided the dataset as we expected a “family effect”. this effect may be caused by an accelerated evolutionary rate in some families which are more prone to gene duplication and/or retention than others, e.g. due to their function or base composition. if one greenphyl tree contained more than one so or up cluster, we kept only one cluster randomly . a detailed overview of the workflow can be found in figure  <dig> 

our final dataset for codeml analysis comprised  <dig> up <dig>   <dig>  up <dig>   <dig> so <dig>  and  <dig>  so <dig> clusters . the mapnh analysis was performed on  <dig> up <dig>   <dig>  up <dig>   <dig> so <dig>  and  <dig>  so <dig> clusters  and  <dig>  up <dig>   <dig>  up <dig>   <dig>  so <dig>  and  <dig>  so <dig> branches . the median length of the up <dig> alignments is  <dig>  bp ,  <dig>  bp for the up <dig>   <dig>  bp for so <dig>  and 987 bp for so <dig> alignments . the up alignments are significantly longer than the so alignments . this can be partially explained by the fact that guidance introduces gaps instead of aligning ambiguous sites  <cit> . therefore, up genes – which are frequently under less selective constraint – may produce longer alignments due to the introduction of gaps. the median number of sequences in an alignment  is  <dig> for up and so alignments . we found that the cluster sizes for the so datasets are significantly smaller than for the up datasets  which was expected because the number of sequences a superortholog cluster can contain is at most ten  whereas it is not bounded for up clusters.

as this divergence time between one species and its closest relative increases, one might expect that the number of detected ups could also increase when compared to a distantly related species than to a closely related one. therefore, we tested if the divergence time and the number of identified up clusters correlated. note that we always used the divergence time relative to the most closely related species in the greenphyl database, no matter if we analysed this species later . regression analysis shows that there is no significant positive correlation between the divergence time and the number of detected clusters: spearman non-parametric correlation coefficient  = − <dig> , p =  <dig>  . the correlation remains not significant after removing m. trunculata . the most likely explanation for this lack of correlation is the equilibrium between gene duplication and loss over time. the birth/death rate has been shown to be relatively constant over time and therefore the frequency of gene copies in a genome declines exponentially with age  <cit> .

positive selection at the codon level
the average number of up clusters used in the final analysis is around  <dig> clusters per species, with brachypodium distachyon showing a very low  and medicago truncatula showing a very high  number of clusters . on average,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of up clusters show evidence for positive selection before and after manual curation, respectively . this discrepancy shows how important manual curation for alignment errors is as we discovered around 50% of alignments with a possible false positive signal. as we were very strict during the manual curation process, the clusters remaining can be considered as true positives but we might have removed some other true positives. there is no significant difference between the number of up <dig> and up <dig> clusters under selection although we detected less – sometimes zero – clusters with codons under selection in the up <dig> dataset, most likely because of a small sample size in this dataset . interestingly, no so <dig> or so <dig> cluster seems to have evolved under positive selection . we also defined a new sub-category of clusters denoted upps that contains the  <dig> up clusters for which positive selected sites were detected and manually validated . the upps clusters have a longer median length  and larger median cluster size  than the other up and so clusters .

ω at the branch level
the analysis of selective pressures at the branch level was performed using mapnh on the same dataset as the codon analysis. if ω at a branch is larger than  <dig>  we consider this a strong indicator of positive selection . the mean ω of the branches is significantly  higher in up <dig>  than in so <dig>  and the distribution shows a larger variance for up <dig> than for so <dig> . as compared to so <dig>  in up <dig> we observe:  a higher proportion of branches with ω >  <dig>  ,  higher ω values for branches with ω >  <dig>  , and  higher ω values for branches with ω <  <dig> . this indicates a relaxation of purifying selection for up <dig> in contrast to so <dig> but also a higher frequency of branches harboring an accelerated evolution rate. similar results are observed on the up and so clusters extracted from the same trees . mean ω is significantly  higher for up <dig>  than for so <dig> . interestingly, the mean ω for up <dig> and up <dig> differ significantly , indicating the family effect mentioned before. for the upps clusters, the mean ω , the proportion of branches with ω >  <dig>  , and the mean ω of branches with ω >  <dig>   are higher compared to the up <dig> and up <dig> clusters .

effect of cluster size and length
the up clusters are longer and contain more sequences than the so clusters . this could lead to an underestimation of codons under selection in so clusters as codeml has more power to detect footprints of positive selection in longer/larger alignments  <cit> . a general linear model analysis showed that differences in alignment length cannot explain the detected differences between up and so clusters if cluster size  is ≤  <dig> . cluster size, however, had an effect. in order to test the reliability of our results relative to the number of sequences, we performed fisher's exact tests to see if we could find either significantly more clusters, codons, and/or branches under selection for up than for so cluster in each cluster size category . we find significantly more clusters under positive selection for up clusters for the size categories  <dig> and  <dig> . for the other size categories we lack power to detect significant differences . we also detect significantly more codons showing footprints of selection in up clusters for the size categories 6– <dig> . in addition, branches with ω >  <dig>  are significantly more frequent in up clusters for size categories 5– <dig> . to summarize, up clusters still show more signatures of positive selection more frequently after controlling for cluster size effect.

effect of evolutionary time and polymorphism
to see if our results are biased by divergence discrepancies between up and so, we sorted the ω value of each branch by their synonymous substitution rate . to rule out the effect of polymorphism, we excluded  external branches from the dataset and compared the remaining  internal branches  to the so dataset. we found a significant difference between the ω of so and upint in ds intervals ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . there is no significant difference in the first ds interval , most likely because of residual polymorphism and/or a low mutation rate in so and up clusters. this interval harbors, however, more than 50% of the dataset. these results indicate that – except for very low ds values – the difference between so and up cluster cannot be explained solely by divergence discrepancies or residual polymorphism. above ds values of  <dig>  the mann–whitney test is inconclusive  due to lack of power.

annotation of clusters under selection
the greenphyldb provides details on predicted molecular function, biological process, cellular component, and family and domain annotation for each cluster. we extracted those details for clusters found to have evolved under positive selection using codeml’s site model. additional file  <dig> provides the details of the annotations for all the clusters with codons under selection before excluding clusters which derive from the same greenphyl tree . annotation is an ongoing process on the greenphyldb; therefore most of the clusters are not annotated – especially in monocots. there seems to be no trend in tree size or species specificity as clusters shown to have codons under selection can both be found in large trees containing sequences from various plant species and from small species specific trees . as annotation is ongoing and remains under constant modification, a comprehensive analysis of the potential function of the clusters with codons under selection would not lead to reliable results. however, some trends can be observed:  the most abundant molecular function is “protein binding”  followed by “transferase activity” . this is especially true in the level  <dig> dataset  whereas potential molecular functions seem to be more diverse in the level  <dig> dataset .  the most common predicted biological functions are “metabolic process”  and “oxidation-reduction process” . “defense”  is also dominant, but only in the level  <dig> dataset .  if domains are annotated to the clusters with codons under selection, f-box , leucine rich repeats , and nb-arcs  are predominant. again, this trend is mostly visible in the level  <dig> dataset whereas potential domains are more diverse in the level  <dig> dataset .

discussion
the important role of duplicated genes in plant adaptation has been argued theoretically . to assess whether lineage specific expanded  genes show more evidence for positive selection than single-copy genes we analyzed lse gene families from ten angiosperm genomes using a dn/ds-based test. we found positive selection footprints moderately frequently at the codon level in lse genes  but did not find any positive selection footprints on single-copy genes after manual curation. the number of codons under positive selection is also found higher in lse than in single copy genes for different cluster size categories and thus cannot be explained solely by a difference of power to detect positive selection between the two datasets. positive selection is also detected in lse genes at the branch level and we found a significantly higher proportion of branches under positive selection among lse gene trees than among single-copy ones. inferring dn/ds at the branch level is complementary to analyzing dn/ds at the codon level. using site models, dn/ds-based tests have the greatest power to detect footprints of selection in genes involved in co-evolutionary processes as a limited subset of their codons is repeatedly subject to positive selection . at the branch level, the evolutionary rate is averaged over the complete amino acid sequence, making it difficult to detect a signal when only few sites are targets of positive selection. however, an elevated evolutionary rate can be detected even if it affects only certain lineages. when dn/ds was computed on all the branches of the same dataset as for site analyses, we detected a stronger effect of positive selection on lse genes compared to single-copy genes. therefore, we argue that lse genes are a much more important substrate for positive selection to act on than single-copy genes. this is – to our knowledge – the first genome-scale study to empirically demonstrate that lse genes fuel adaptation in angiosperms.

among the vast literature dealing with population genetic models of duplicated gene evolution, a crucial point is whether natural selection plays a role in it  <cit> . positive selection is expected to act either on the fixation process of the duplication itself or at new mutations occurring after fixation of the copy in the species . we found a significantly larger portion of lse genes under positive selection compared to single copy ones. hence, the differentiation between copies for lse genes is driven by changes in proteins, with all the functional consequences this may imply. this result corresponds to predictions made by several models, e.g. the “adaptation” model  <cit>  or the “adaptive conflict” model  <cit> . in these scenarios, the duplication itself is not subject to positive selection, and may be fixed by genetic drift. however, our results may be coherent with a third scenario of segregation avoidance  <cit>  where several alleles are pre-existing at the ancestral unique locus and their retention is advantageous  <cit> . thus, duplications may favor the retention of those alleles if each of them gets fixed at one of the different locus resulting from the duplication process. in this scenario, positive selection does occur on the fixation process itself and the non-synonymous mutation observed would have appeared before the duplication process. however, it is not possible to tell which of these scenarios is more likely in our data, all the more that those scenarios can be combined in more complex ones. for instance, a first duplication may occur allowing a unique gene to escape an adaptive conflict and subsequent duplications may occur; generating additional copies following – this time – an adaptive scenario.

recent progress in angiosperm whole genome sequencing gave numerous arguments in favor of the positive role of polyploidy in the exceptional radiation and diversification of angiosperms  <cit> . these hypotheses rely on the evolutionary potential caused by genomic shocks such as polyploidy. our study shows that genomic events leading to gene duplications at a smaller scale – especially when recurring at a high frequency as it has been described in angiosperm genomes  <cit>  – appear also fundamental in the adaptive dynamic of angiosperms. recurrent gene duplication/retention offer a mechanism complementary to wgd as it may take place all along the evolutionary time and can affect a specific subset of gene families. such families might be targeted according to their implication in biological processes or molecular functions related to the ongoing natural selective pressure. this could be reflected by the trends we observed in the annotations of the genes containing codons under selection: many are involved in defense and protein binding is the most common molecular function.

the most abundant domains we found in lse clusters showing signatures of positive selection are f-box and lrr domains. f-box proteins  are one of the largest and fastest evolving gene families in land plants  <cit> . when analyzing fbp subfamilies in seven land plant species, it was found that 64-67% of duplications are species-specific – mostly in angiosperms  <cit> . expression analysis of lse fbps showed a fast subfunctionalization on the transcriptional level  <cit> . finally, it was also found that the lse fbp are less conserved than their single-copy counterparts and signatures of positive selection are predominantly found in the protein-protein interaction domains of the fbps  <cit> . an equally large gene family comprises of receptor-like kinases  containing lrrs in their extracellular domain  <cit> . two main functions are described for lrr-rlks: development and defense  <cit> . lrr-rlks involved in defense are predominantly found in lse gene clusters whereas lrr-rlks involved in development are mostly found in non-expanded groups  <cit> . it was also discovered that the lrr domains are significantly less conserved than the remaining domains of the lrr-rlk genes  <cit> . in addition, a study on four plant genomes showed that lrr-rlk genes from lse gene clusters show significantly more indication of positive selection or relaxed constraint than lrr-rlks from non-expanded groups  <cit> . therefore, it is not surprising that f-box and lrr domains are the most abundant domains we found in the lse clusters with codons under positive selection. first, proteins containing these domains constitute large gene families and are therefore likely to show up in our lse dataset – especially when coming from the greenphyl level  <dig> dataset as it comprises of large trees. second, several studies showed that these proteins/domains are prone to fast evolution and adaptation  <cit> . the results shown here give valuable insight in the evolution of large gene families and provide the groundwork for more detailed analyses of these candidates.

as automated multi-step genome wide analyses can sometimes introduce biases and misinterpretations, we took the maximum of precautions at each step. first, we chose well-annotated genomes to reduce the bias of mis-annotations, although we cannot completely rule them out. annotation errors could lead to an over-estimation of the evolutionary rate in duplicated genes  <cit> . this left us with ten angiosperm genomes, even though many completely sequenced genomes are now available. second, as dn/ds-based methods are very sensitive to alignment errors  <cit> , reliable alignment and cleaning tools are mandatory. we used prank and guidance to align and clean the sequence clusters. those recent methods have been found to produce the most reliable alignments for downstream analysis using the paml software  <cit> . third, we curated the alignments for which we detected positive selection manually. as this is a great deal of work in large datasets many studies fail to do this. however, we argue that this step is crucial to produce reliable results as we found around 50% alignment errors and therefore false positives. the manual validation of all the positively selected sites is a major strength of our study. fourth, the power for dn/ds analysis is related to the number of sequences aligned. in our dataset the difference in sequence number was significant between the lse and the single-copy dataset. this could explain, at least partially, the detection of a higher number of clusters with sites under positive selection. by analyzing lse and single-copy gene clusters in each size categories separately we ruled out the effect of cluster size and showed that the number of clusters, codons and branches under positive selection is always higher in lse genes compared to single-copy genes. fifth, we wanted control for a potential “family effect” that could result from the fact that some gene families showing accelerated evolutionary rate in general, e.g. because of their function or base composition, may also be more prone to gene duplication and/or retention than others. using subgroups we indeed found an effect: lse clusters from trees containing also a single-copy gene clusters show a lower dn/ds compared to lse clusters from trees without single-copy gene clusters. this means that the more a gene family is prone to duplication/retention the less probable a single-copy gene cluster will be found. here, we give an argument in favor of the hypothesis that the initial level of selective constraint partially conditions the frequency of duplication/retention. we detect a family effect in different trees but the dn/ds difference between lse clusters and single-copy gene sets remains significant when controlling for this effect by comparing clusters extracted from the same gene trees.

finally, when analyzing very recent duplicates it is possible that the differences between copies are still segregating within populations which violates basic assumptions of dn/ds-based tests  <cit> . our lse dataset may include genes where differences are still polymorphic which can lead to an overestimation of positive selection  <cit> . as expected, dn/ds is elevated – and most likely over-estimated – for low ds values in lse as well as in single-copy gene clusters. the reason for this effect is either polymorphism segregating in young copies  or a low mutation rate . however, even after removing external  lse branches, the difference between single-copy and lse gene clusters is still significant for ds values above  <dig> . this result shows that polymorphism and/or a low mutation rate alone cannot explain the differences in dn/ds between lse and single-copy genes.

functional analysis is difficult in recently expanded gene families because functional or gene expression differences are difficult to investigate due to highly similar sequences among copies. additionally, many of these genes are involved in stress responses  <cit>  and therefore specific conditions need to be defined a priori. consequently, molecular evolution studies like ours are a good alternative to identify candidates in which family expansion is followed by an adaptive process to conduct further analyses. another next step could be to investigate links between our results and the duplication mode. by looking at the location of duplicated genes in the genome the duplication mode can be assessed. several studies showed that the duplication mode has an impact on genetic novelty and adaptation  <cit> . for example, it was demonstrated that tdgs are more often involved in abiotic stress response than non-tdgs  <cit> . however, a dn/ds approach is not suitable to provide evidence for positive selection on the duplication process itself which is the assumption under the dosage effect hypothesis  <cit> . therefore, we ignore gene conservation as potential outcome and subsequently probably underestimate the role of adaptation in gene duplication/retention.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we conduct one of the largest studies on the role of recurrent gene duplication on adaptation in angiosperms so far. indeed, most of the former studies either dealt with candidate families in a broad taxonomical range  or whole genomes for a maximum of four plant species . we searched duplicated genes from ten angiosperm genomes for footprints of positive selection and our results provide candidates for further functional or population genetic studies. in general, we used a very conservative approach to detect positive selection footprints at lse genes and might therefore miss many true positives. still, because of the inherent differences between lse and single-copy datasets, our results must be interpreted with caution. as the number and quality of sequenced genomes is increasing daily, our analysis can be expanded to many more plant species in the future. in addition, current efforts in re-sequencing numerous genomes from different populations could give the opportunity to differentiate between divergence and polymorphism and to consequently provide even better estimates of quantity and quality of positive selection undergone by lse genes.
