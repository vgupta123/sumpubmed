BACKGROUND
bacteria are developing resistance to antibiotics at an alarming rate, thus the development of new antibiotic alternatives continues to be extremely urgent  <cit> . because of their antibacterial properties, antimicrobial peptides  are expected to become ideal antibiotic alternatives  <cit> . amps are generally between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid residues, and are strongly cationic   <cit> . amps are characterized by their broad spectrum of activities and their antibacterial mechanism differs from traditional antibiotics  <cit> . to date, there are more than  <dig> types of amps that have been isolated, including some that have been used in the health care and food processing industries  <cit> .

amps are primarily harvested via natural extraction, chemical synthesis and genetic engineering. the large-scale application of amps is restricted by limitations in sourcing the natural products and the high production costs of chemical synthesis. a prokaryotic expression system can reduce the production cost of amps and increase their large-scale applications  <cit> . however, prokaryotic expression of amps is technically challenging because amps are not only toxic to the host, but also susceptible to exogenous protease degradation. previous studies have shown that use of a fusion tag system can achieve effective expression of amps  <cit> . fusion tags commonly used include thioredoxin, steroid isomerase and glutathione-s-transferase enzymes. however new fusion tags useful to improve the yield of amps are continuously coming out.

ubiquitin  has  <dig> amino acids and mainly functions to label proteins for hydrolysis  <cit> . small ubiquitin-related modifier  consists of about  <dig> amino acid residues, and modulates protein structure and function by covalent modification of target proteins in eukaryotes. yeast cells have only one sumo gene , while there are four sumo genes in vertebrates, sumo <dig>  sumo <dig>  sumo <dig>  sumo <dig>  <cit> . recent studies have shown that ub and sumo were used as fusion tags. their small sizes bring relatively high peptide-to-carrier ratios, favors the increase of yield in the production of antimicrobial peptides. the highly specific sumoase facilitates efficient release of the antimicrobial peptide  <cit> . in previous studies, we obtained the amp a20l   <cit> , which is a derivative of the v13k in which the amino acid alanine in position  <dig> was substituted by leucine, and showed that it possesses good antimicrobial activity and low hemolytic activity. in this study, we used the ub-tag and human sumo1/2/3/4-tag fusion to express a20l in a prokaryotic system and further explore the antibacterial mechanism of action of amps with membrane permeabilization experiments, tryptophan fluorescence and quenching experiments in liposomes.

RESULTS
expression, purification and digestion of ub-a20l and sumo1/2/3/4-a20l
to explore the function of ub protein and sumo1/2/3/ <dig> proteins as fusion tags, we fused the ub and sumo1/2/3/ <dig> with a20l to construct expression plasmids. ub-a20l and sumo1/2/ <dig> gene sequences were inserted into the phue plasmids and pet-28b + plasmids, respectively, to construct phue-a20l plasmids and pet-28b + −sumo1/2/3/4-a20l plasmids. these plasmids were transformed into e. coli rosetta  and induced with iptg to express ub-a20l and sumo1/2/3/ <dig> fusion proteins. the recombinant proteins were found in the soluble fraction after being over expressed in e. coli rosetta . their relative expression levels were calculated by gel scanning . the yield of the protein expression was  <dig>  mg/l and  <dig> – <dig>  mg/l for ub-a20l and sumo1/2/3/ <dig>  respectively . after cell disruption, the supernatant was obtained and purified using ni-nta affinity chromatography and cm sepharose ff cation exchange chromatography. the peptide purity was determined by 12 % sds-page, and the protein yield was determined by the bca method. the yield of ub-a20l and sumo1/2/3/4-a20l was  <dig>  mg/l and  <dig> – <dig>  mg/l, respectively . after sumoase cleavage, the a20l peptide was obtained from sephadex g <dig> column purification. the yield of the a20l peptide was  <dig>  mg/l from ub-a20l and  <dig> – <dig>  mg/l from sumo1/2/3/4-a20l after enzyme digestion . this indicates that both ub and sumo1/2/3/ <dig> tags are able to promote the expression of the a20l peptide, but ub-tag was effective than sumo1/2/3/ <dig> fig.  <dig>  expression of a20l fused with ub, sumo <dig>  sumo <dig>  sumo <dig> and sumo <dig> proteins. : molecular weight marker; : un-induced culture; : induced culture; : ni-nta purified pool;  purification of ub-a20land sumo1/2/3/4-a20l by cm sepharose ff. : molecular weight marker;  ub-a20l;  sumo1-a20l;  sumo2-a20l;  sumo3-a20l;  sumo4-a20l;  purification of a20l : molecular weight marker; : a20l purified from ub-a20l,sumo1-a20l,sumo2-a20l, sumo3-a20l,sumo4-a20l

peptide secondary structure
the helicity is a biophysical parameter closely related to the antibacterial activity  <cit> . in this study, we studied the variation in the secondary structure of the a20l peptide by measuring its circular dichroism spectrum under different buffer systems. the results showed that the   <dig> of a20l in the non-denaturating buffer was − <dig> degree • cm2• dmol− <dig>  indicating that the structure of a20l is disordered, while the   <dig> of the peptide was − <dig> degree•cm2•dmol− <dig> in the presence of 50 % tfe to mimic the hydrophobic environment, indicating that the peptide formed a typical α-helical structure under hydrophobic environments such as biomembranes .fig.  <dig> circulat dichroism  spectra of the antimicrobial peptide a20l. open symbols denote the cd spectra of the peptide in non-denaturating conditions ; solid symbols denote the cd spectra obtained in the presence of an α-helix inducing solvent tfe 



membrane permeabilization
gram-negative bacterial cell membranes are divided into outer and inner membranes, whilst, gram-positive bacteria only have cytoplasmic membranes, which are composed of similar lipid components as the inner membranes of gram-negative bacteria. pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli ml- <dig> were selected for the outer membrane and inner membrane assays, respectively, since pseudomonas aeruginosa is a most common infectious bacterium in clinics and escherichia coli ml- <dig> is a lactose permease-deficient strain. amps provoke the disruption of the bacterial membrane to kill the bacteria. after a20l interacts with bacteria, changes in the outer membrane permeability can be detected using the fluorescence probe npn. the fluorescence intensity emitted from npn is weak in a hydrophilic environment, but very strong in a hydrophobic environment such as the hydrophobic core of a bacterial cell membrane  <cit> . in the outer membrane permeabilization experiment, after the interaction of a20l with bacteria, npn was deeply inserted into the core of hydrophobic region within 2 min, and the fluorescence intensity was observed to increase from  <dig> to  <dig> .fig.  <dig> membrane permeabilization assay of the antimicrobial peptide a20l.  outer membrane permeabilization induced by a20l was detected by npn uptake in p. aeruginosa atcc 27853;  the effect of a20l on the inner membrane of e. coli ml- <dig>  release of cytoplasmic β-galactosidase activity  from e. coli ml- <dig> treated with a20l



β-galactosidase is located in the bacterial cytoplasm, and can hydrolyze onpg into galactose and o-nitrophenol which shows yellow color. in untreated e. coli, onpg is transferred into the cytoplasm via lactose permease, while if inner membrane destruction has occurred, onpg can rapidly enter into the bacteria to react with β-galactosidase. by measuring the change in od <dig> nm, we could determine whether or not onpg was able to penetrate the cytoplasm, thus indicating whether the bacterial inner membrane is damaged  <cit> . the intracellular release of β-galactosidase became stable after 10 min and the od <dig> nm increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . outer and inner membrane permeabilization assays indicate that the a20l peptide exhibited destructive effects on both bacteria membranes. additionally, there was a clear distinction between the penetration time of a20l into the outer and inner bacterial membranes. as expected, a20l first damaged the outer membranes, then the inner membranes were also damaged subsequently.

interaction of a20l with liposomes
in this study, tryptophan fluorescence and quenching experiments were carried out to study the insertion of a20l into different types of membrane structures. tryptophan fluorescence intensity is increased in a hydrophobic environment, and the blue shift occurred at the maximum emission wavelength. in the absence of the peptide, the maximum emission wavelength of tryptophan fluorescence was  <dig>  nm. the liposomes pc/pg  and the pc/cholesterol  were made to mimic a bacterial and a eukaryotic membrane, respectively  <cit> . when the a20l interacted with the pc/cholesterol liposomes, the maximum emission wavelength was  <dig>  nm, with no obvious blue shift, which indicates that the a20l peptide did not strongly interact with the eukaryotic cell membrane. by contrast, when the a20l interacted with the pc/pg liposomes, the maximum emission wavelength of tryptophan fluorescence was  <dig>  nm was accomplished by a shift to blue color, suggesting that the tryptophan moved into the hydrophobic core of the membrane and could strongly interact with the prokaryotic membrane .fig.  <dig> fluorescence emission spectra and stern-volmer plot of a20l using various liposome models.  tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra of the antimicrobial peptide a20l;  stern-volmer plots of the tryptophan fluorescence were obtained by the sequential addition of the fluorescence quencher ki



the water-soluble fluorescent ki quencher was used to determine the degree of a20l interaction with prokaryotic and eukaryotic membranes as it is able to reduce the tryptophan fluorescence in the solution . the ksv value of a20l was lower when added to pc/pg and pc/chol liposomes, suggesting that the antimicrobial peptide a20l is deeper inserted into the prokaryotic membrane, and, consequently, exhibit stronger interaction specificity with the prokaryotic membrane than with the eukaryotic one. these results are consistent with the findings from mic, mhc and therapeutic index.

discussion
through the use of fusion tags, the toxicity of amps to the host cells can be reduced and their resistance to intracellular protease degradation increased, thereby improving their production yield  <cit> . fusion tags can be classified into aggregation-promoting carriers and solubility-enhancing carriers. the purf fragment, pap <dig>  and ksi are aggregation-promoting carriers. amp fused with aggregation-promoting carriers was shown to be toxic to host bacterial cells  <cit> . thioredoxin  and glutathione-s-transferase  are solubility-enhancing carriers, but their large molecular weight indirectly led to low amp yields . the ub-tag and sumo1/2/3/4-tags are small and thus are useful for increasing the proportion of amps in fusion proteins, thereby increasing the yield of amps. currently, nz <dig>  lacticin q and cecropin ad have been expressed successfully in e. coli, b. subtilis and p. pastoris by fusion to the sumo-tag . however, yeast cells are most commonly reported as the source of sumo-tagged fusion peptides  <cit> , while ub-tagged and human sumo-tagged fusion peptides are rarely reported. the use of a sumo4-tag and ub-tag for amp expression has not yet been reported previously. herein, we explored the expression of a20l tagged with an ub-tag and sumo1/2/3/4-tags to optimize the expression approach of amp production. our findings indicate that the expression yield was the highest for the ub-tag fusion, and the sumo1-tag was superior to the sumo2/3/4-tags. it was interesting to see that all the human ub-tag and sumo1/2/3/4-tags were effective as fusion tags of amps; moreover, the ub-tag not only promoted the soluble expression of the amp, but also produced a higher yield than the human sumo1/2/3/4-tags. the enhancement of both solubility and yield of the peptide a20l obatained by using ub-tag and human sumo1/2/3/4-tag systems should enhance the large-scale production of amps. future work will approach further research to optimize the fusion tags in order to increase amps production.

amps can act by inducing membrane injury or intracellular injury  <cit> . the antibacterial activity of α-helical amps depends on their helicity, positive charge and hydrophobicity, etc. after interaction with bacterial cell membranes carrying negative charges, the secondary structure of amps is induced to become α-helical in nature, destroying the membrane integrity, affecting the electrochemical potential and ionic balance of the cell membrane, resulting in leakage of the cell contents, and finally causing bacterial death  <cit> . a20l peptides contain hydrophobic and positively charged amino acids  <cit> . circular dichroism experiments have shown that the secondary structure of a20l adopted an α-helical from a random coil structure after the interaction with hydrophobic solvents that mimick the hydrophobic environment of cell membranes. in the bacterial membrane permeabilization experiments, a20l peptide caused rapid damage to the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, allowing npn to insert into the hydrophobic environment, thereby yielding increased fluorescence. in addition, after the damage to the bacterial inner membrane by a20l, β-galactosidase was released from the cells and reacted with the substrate, onpg, suggesting that the bacterial membrane is the target of a20l peptide.

bacterial and eukaryotic cells exhibit many differences in the structure and function of their membranes. prokaryotic cells with a large amount of negative charges are mainly composed of phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, and phosphatidylserine. in contrast, eukaryotic cells have zwitterionic phospholipids, including phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and sphingomyelin. different membrane lipid compositions play a crucial role in the specificity of amps  <cit> . in this regard, we prepared liposomes containing different phospholipids to mimic prokaryotic and eukaryotic membranes. tryptophan fluorescence and ki quenching experiments showed a stronger interaction between the a20l peptide and the prokaryotic membrane. the mechanisms used to describe the interaction of amps with bacterial cell membranes include the “carpet” model, “barrel-stave” model, “toroidal-pore” model and “aggregate channel” model  <cit> . we suggest that the “membrane discrimination mechanism” could well describe how α-helical amps interact with cell membranes as well as the specificity of amps  <cit> . the mechanism depends upon the difference in membrane composition between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. a20l forms pores/channels in the hydrophobic core of the eukaryotic bilayer by bundles of amphipathic α-helices producing an aqueous pore, it caused the hemolysis of human red blood cells; the mechanism of a20l with eukaryotic cells is a “barrel-stave” mechanism. the positive charge residues of a20l interact with the negatively charged phospholipid in prokaryotic cells, a20l kills prokaryotic cells by the “carpet” mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, both the ub-tag and sumo1/2/3/4-tags may be useful for the fusion expression of α-helical amps on an industrial scale. ub-tag was proved as the most efficient approach for the expression of α-helical antimicrobial peptide a20l. application of fusion tags for production of amps would help to reduce costs and would be widely applicable for use with a variety of amps. the mic and mhc values indicated that the a20l peptide obtained from the fusion expression showed good antibacterial and low hemolytic activities. the results from the interaction of the a20l peptide with liposomes indicated that the membrane discrimination mechanism may be suitable for explaining the mechanism of action of α-helical amps.
