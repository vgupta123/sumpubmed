BACKGROUND
plant biomass is the most abundant natural material on earth and the only foreseeable sustainable source of fuels and materials available to humanity  <cit> . it mainly consists of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, pectin and other polymers in ratios that vary between plant species  <cit> . cellulose, the main polymeric component of plant biomass  <cit> , pt?>consists of d-glucoside residues linked by beta- <dig> -glycosidic bonds to form linear polymeric chains of over  <dig> glucose residues. cellulose usually contains regions that are highly crystalline in nature  <cit> . the hydrolysis of cellulose and the degradation of the other polysaccharides in plant biomass require many types of enzymes  that work in concert  <cit> . even when enzymes work synergistically, degradation of recalcitrant lignocellulose is more difficult than degradation of many other natural materials, such as starch  <cit> .

the key step for the utilization of plant biomass  is to degrade it into sugars or oligosaccharides by means of various hydrolytic enzymes. the central technological impediment is the general absence of low-cost technology for overcoming the recalcitrance of lignocellulosic biomass, as the costs of cellulases and hemicellulases contribute substantially to the price  <cit> . studies aimed at understanding and increasing the efficiency and productivity of plant biomass-degrading enzymes are at the forefront of this research. by combining enzyme engineering methods  with effective screening protocols  <cit> , fold-increased activity and thermostability of enzymes have been achieved . however, protein engineering strategies are not always effective and may only make relatively small changes to existing enzymes. consequently, screening of high-efficiency strains and gene resources is critical for improving biomass utilization  <cit> .

filamentous fungi are widely used for their capacity to produce extracellular proteins in large quantities  <cit> . as a result of their saprotrophic lifestyle, filamentous fungi can secret a wide range of enzymes into their habitats, enabling them to metabolize a variety of plant polysaccharides. one filamentous fungus, neurospora crassa, has long served as a model fungus  <cit>  and the molecular techniques developed for n. crassa studies have also been widely applied to other filamentous fungi  <cit> . meanwhile, aspergillus genus species  have long been used in the enzymatic industry  <cit> . another industrial fungus, trichoderma reesei, was reported to have the ability to produce  <dig> g of extracellular cellulases per liter  <cit> . whole genomes of all of these fungi have been sequenced, which has greatly facilitated the understanding of their highly efficient biomass-degradation mechanisms  <cit> , the design of enzyme cocktails  <cit> , and the engineering of strains for higher protein expression.

as we know, a. fumigatus is as versatile in nature as other model fungi. however, there are few detailed studies of its ability to degrade plant biomass, even though some strains of this species are recognized as potent producers of lignocellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes  <cit> . in our previous study a. fumigatus z <dig> isolated from compost heaps of plant straw, has been shown to produce highly thermostable lignocellulosic enzyme activities  <cit> . many of the glycoside hydrolases are closely related and have redundant  functions, which may facilitate the survival of a. fumigatus z <dig> under different environmental conditions  or may be necessary to effectively depolymerize complex carbohydrate polymers. in order to further understand the biomass-degradation mechanism used by this fungus and to facilitate the development of its applications, the genome sequence of a. fumigatus z <dig> was determined and the transcriptomic profiles induced by sucrose, xylan, cellulose and rice straw were compared. combined analysis of the genomic and transcriptomic data provides a comprehensive understanding of the responding mechanisms to the most abundant natural polysaccharides in a. fumigatus, as well as a roadmap for biomass utilization and the industrial application of gene resources or as a host for protein expression.

RESULTS
general genomic features and comparison with several industrial strains
phylogenetic analysis  of strain z <dig> and other species in the aspergillus section fumigati was based on the β-tubulin, calmodulin and its <dig> and  <dig>  sequences  <cit> , confirming the attribution of z <dig> to a. fumigatus. the a. fumigatus z <dig> genome was sequenced using the  <dig> gs flx platform  <cit> . a total of  <dig> contigs were assembled from the reads. of the contigs,  <dig> were longer than  <dig> kb. the n <dig> has a length of  <dig> kb . these contigs were assembled into  <dig> scaffolds with a total length of  <dig>  mb and an n <dig> length of  <dig>  mb. the genome was predicted to contain  <dig> genes that encode proteins with a length greater than  <dig> amino acid residues. the genome was composed of  <dig> chromosomes, as determined by matching scaffolds with the chromosomes of a. fumigatus af <dig>  <cit>  . strain z <dig> has  <dig> unique proteins when compared to a. fumigatus af <dig> and n. fischeri nrrl  <dig>  and of these unique proteins,  <dig> were annotated as hypothetical proteins. genome statistics are presented in table  <dig>  several z <dig> scaffolds matched different chromosomes of a. fumigatus af <dig>  suggesting that duplication of genomic fragments likely occurred in strain z <dig> during the evolution of z <dig> from the common ancestor.table  <dig> genome features of a. fumigatus z5



a. fumigatus z <dig> has  <dig> significantly different protein-coding genes compared to other  <dig> well-studied filamentous fungi . interpro  <cit>  identification of conserved domains and families among predicted proteins of a. fumigatus z <dig> could provide an overview of the expression capability of this filamentous fungus . a large expansion in the interpro category corresponding to the major facilitator superfamily  in aspergillus genus may reflect their powerful ability to transport small solutes compared with  <dig> other filamentous fungi, t. reesei and n. crassa. about the number of sugar transporters in mfs transporters, aspergillus genus has an average of  <dig> sugar transporters, nearly two folds of those in t. reesei and n. crassa, and this expansion of z <dig> was happened in the sugar porter  family  which covered 90 % of all the sugar transporters in these fungi . consistent with the capacity for efficient lignocellulose degradation, strain z <dig>  like three other aspergillus species , has a relatively high number of glycoside hydrolase superfamily genes . compared to t. reesei and n. crassa, the aspergillus genus has more fungal-specific transcription factors , suggesting that aspergillus species have more complex or redundant regulation mechanisms. a. fumigatus z <dig> has  <dig> cytochrome p <dig> genes , which play important roles in secondary metabolism, while a. fumigatus af <dig> has only  <dig> cytochrome p <dig> genes  <cit> . in order to identify lignocellulose-degrading proteins, the protein domains encoded by the a. fumigatus z <dig> genome were compared with the genomes of six other fungi widely used in industry . the aspergillus strains were found to contain more glycoside hydrolases, pectate lyases  and tannases  than when compared to t. reesei and n. crassa.table  <dig> specific proteins in six filamentous fungi

carbohydrate-active enzymes in a. fumigatus z5
carbohydrate-active enzymes  are categorized into different classes  in the cazy database   <cit> . cazymes cleave, build and rearrange oligo- and polysaccharides. these functions play important roles in fungi such as a. fumigatus and are vital for optimizing biomass degradation by these species  <cit> . given the importance of this protein family for biomass utilization, a detailed examination of the cazome of a. fumigatus z <dig> was performed.

the genome of a. fumigatus z <dig>  which efficiently degrades plant polysaccharides, encodes approximately  <dig> putative carbohydrate-active enzymes , which were divided into at least  <dig> distinct families . compared to several available a. fumigatus and n. fisheri genomes in the aspergillus section fumigati , no significant differences were found in the distribution of cazyme classes between our strain z <dig> and other three a. fumigatus, and  <dig>  % cazyme proteins in n. fisheri genome showed homogenous with those of a. fumigatus. in fact, aspergillus genus has the leading position in the number of cazyme genes among the  <dig> publicly available fungal genomes  <cit> . figure  <dig> depicts the distribution of cazyme genes by family and the responses of gene families to the induction by extracellular polysaccharides. of the glycoside hydrolase genes,  <dig>  % had significantly higher expression levels  after polysaccharide induction than after sucrose induction . most of the glycoside hydrolases with significantly increased expression were responsible for the degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin . under the same conditions, the carbohydrate-binding module, carbohydrate esterase, auxiliary activities and polysaccharide lyase families also had a relative high percentage of induced genes . however, glycosyltransferases appeared to fulfill a secondary or supportive role in polysaccharides degradation because only a very small percentage of genes were induced,  <dig>  %.table  <dig> cazyme gene numbers in a. fumigatus and n. fischeri

plant biomass contains cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin and other natural materials such as lignin, the degradation of which requires many enzymes working synergistically. cellulose degradation requires endoglucanases , cellobiohydrolases  and β-glucosidases. egs catalyze the hydrolysis of cellulose at random positions in less crystalline regions, and cbhs act processively on the non-reducing ends of the chains to release the disaccharide cellobiose, which is cleaved by β-glucosidases to yield glucose  <cit> . a thorough inspection of the z <dig> genome revealed at least  <dig> egs,  <dig> cbhs and at least  <dig> β-glucosidases . egs in z <dig> belong to six glycoside hydrolase families , with seven egs in these families having cbm <dig> domains . two cbhs from strain z <dig> belong to the family gh <dig>  and another belongs to the family gh <dig> . z <dig> has four β-glucosidases in family gh <dig> and  <dig> in gh <dig>  the cellulase genes of a. fumigatus z <dig> are not closely adjacent in the genome except for an endoglucanase  and a cellobiohydrolase . in addition to the enzymes responsible for the degradation of cellulose, numerous other plant cell wall polysaccharide-degrading enzymes were also predicted in the a. fumigatus z <dig> genome, including hemicellulases and pectinases, which have catalytic activities for degradation of hemicelluloses and pectin, respectively . analysis of the cazyme gene locations in the z <dig> genome revealed that cazyme genes were nonrandomly distributed within the genome. of the  <dig> cazyme genes,  <dig> were located in one of  <dig> discrete regions, which ranged from  <dig>  kb to  <dig> kb in length  . each region contained two to  <dig> cazyme genes. most of the cazyme genes in the clusters were not from the same subfamily, which indicated that gene relocation rather than duplication was responsible for the formation of the cazyme gene clusters. approximately  <dig>  %  of the cazyme genes in the clusters encoded glycoside hydrolases. the fact that  <dig>  % of the glycoside hydrolase genes and  <dig>  % of the glycosyltransferase genes were located in these clusters indicated that the majority of the cazymes were involved in polysaccharide degradation. furthermore, of the genes that were differentially expressed in treatment conditions  when compared to the sucrose as a control condition, most were located in or around the cazyme-rich regions .fig.  <dig> cazyme gene clusters and co-regulated fragments. a cazyme gene clusters: cluster  <dig> contained a beta- <dig> -endoglucanase gene  and an acetyl xylan esterase gene , as well as  <dig> endo- <dig> -beta-xylanase genes . y699_ <dig> encodes an extracellular phytase. in cazyme gene cluster  <dig>  beta-glucosidase and endoglucanase are co-induced. b co-regulated fragments: fragment  <dig> is up-regulated. it includes the cazyme gene cluster  <dig> , in which y699_ <dig> encoded a beta-glucosidase, y699_ <dig> encoded a mfs sugar transporter, y699_ <dig> encoded a xylosidase/arabinosidase and y699_ <dig> encoded a mfs alpha-glucoside transporter. fragment  <dig> includes the secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene cluster  <dig> in which genes are down-regulated in all three treatments compared to sucrose. y699_ <dig> encoded a polyketide synthase

protein secretion of a. fumigatus z5
in contrast to other microorganisms, filamentous fungi can secret large amounts of proteins into the external environment. strain z <dig> is also an extraordinarily efficient producer of extracellular enzymes  <cit> , which makes the analysis of the protein secretion system particular interesting. here, we compared some components of secretory pathway among strain z <dig> and  <dig> other industrially relevant filamentous fungi extensively used for protein secretion . translocation from the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum  occurs in these fungi through established signal recognition particle -dependent and srp-independent pathways  <cit> , which are very important steps for heterologous gene expression. orthologs of most s. cerevisiae proteins in these two pathways were found in strain z <dig> and  <dig> other fungi except for a yeast signal recognition and docking protein, srp21p  <cit> . all these filamentous fungi have a gene encoding protein disulphide isomerase   and  <dig> other pdi-related genes. the chaperone bip, a member of the heat shock  <dig> protein family, is more conserved  than other components of secretory pathways in these fungi, reflecting the central role of bip in translocation into the er, protein folding and regulation response  <cit> . multiple enzymes are required for n-glycosylation of glycoproteins, which involves binding of a preformed oligosaccharide  to asparagine side chains of an immature protein. all six fungi have at least one copy of the key enzymes for this process . which indicates that they may have a common folding and quality control system for glycoproteins. the unfolded protein response  signaling pathway in these fungi differs somewhat from that of yeast. in mammalian cells, the perk  machinery can attenuate protein translation by phosphorylating the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor  <dig>  in the early phase of er stress  <cit> . perk is then inhibited by binding to the hsp <dig> cochaperone p <dig>  the expression of which is induced by ire1/xbp <dig> of the upr pathway. the ortholog of p <dig> was found in the genomes of these fungi but not in yeast, and the ortholog of perk was not found or had low similarity. homologs of most known erad components were found in all these filamentous fungi, despite an apparent lack of orthologs and little sequence similarity to yeast erad components, as reported for the a. niger genome  <cit> . some counterparts of the mammalian gtpase proteins , which are involved in membrane fusion and vesicle budding in diverse cellular locations, were found in all these fungi, whereas they were absent in yeast  <cit> .

in order to get insight into the secretory pathway of a. fumigatus z <dig>  transcriptional profiles of genes in the secretory pathway induced by different carbon sources were analyzed . most genes had higher expression levels when grown on sucrose than on the other three carbon sources . this is interesting because the samples with more extracellular proteins have low gene transcription in protein synthesis. qrt-pcr results of several selected genes verified the transcriptomic data . these results indicated that the polysaccharides-induced samples actually had a relative low stress of protein synthesis when compared to sucrose control. sucrose, as a favored carbon source, could promote the growth of strain z <dig> much faster than other polysaccharides.fig.  <dig> the validation of transcriptomic data. a seven genes in protein synthesis were validated by qrt-pcr after been induced by cellulose for  <dig> h. b all predicted cellulase genes were investigated under the induction of cellulose at time points of  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h after sucrose replaced by cellulose. the color bar indicates the range of lg of relative expression levels in the heat map figures. to distinguish induced and non-induced genes, the values at  <dig> h for each gene were set to  <dig>  c after been induced for  <dig> h, extracellular protein concentration and normalized enzyme activities  were measured for three polysaccharide samples and sucrose control



transcriptional responses of a. fumigatus z <dig> to different carbon sources
genome analysis showed the potential of a wide spectrum of polysaccharide hydrolytic enzymes produced by a. fumigatus z <dig>  in order to determine which hydrolytic enzyme-encoding genes were induced by different substrates , the transcriptional profiles of a. fumigatus z <dig> under these conditions were determined. xylan, as the major component of hemicellulose, was used as a sole carbon source to induce the expression of hemicellulase genes, while cellulose was used as the inducer of cellulases. rice straw, which contains various polysaccharide components, was chosen as a carbon source to study the diversity of the degradation enzymes. a. fumigatus z <dig> was grown on 2 % sucrose , and the mycelia were transferred to 1 %  xylan, cellulose or rice straw as the sole carbon source for  <dig> h. gene expression patterns revealed that comparable genes were differentially expressed in each transcriptome, and many had similar patterns . the xylan-induced gene expression pattern  is relatively similar to the sucrose-induced gene expression pattern , which may be due to the high efficiency of xylan degradation  and xylose-induced carbon catabolite repression  <cit> . however, the cellulose-induced gene expression pattern  and the rice straw-induced gene expression pattern  differ significantly from the sgep . the main aim of this study was to focus on genes that have significantly different expression among the  <dig> different treatments. four hundred and two genes were identified in cluster  <dig> and cluster  <dig>  which showed higher expression levels in the xgep, cgep and rgep than in the sgep. these two clusters contained nearly all of the polysaccharides-degrading genes, including  <dig> cellulases , nine xylanases ,  <dig> alpha-l-arabinofuranosidases and  <dig> acetyl xylan esterases. seven other cellulases  were found in cluster  <dig> and were expressed at higher levels in the cgep and rgep than in the sgep and xgep. together, these results show that both cellulose and xylan can induce the expression of cellulase and xylanase genes, but xylan induces fewer cellulase genes . three cellobiose dehydrogenase  genes  were detected in the a. fumigatus z <dig> genome. consistent with a recent report that cellobiose dehydrogenase and a copper-dependent polysaccharide monooxygenase can enhance cellulose degradation  <cit> , we found that the cdh gene  was induced by the substrates cellulose and rice straw. gene y699_ <dig> in cluster  <dig> only had a high expression level in rgep compared to the three other patterns, suggested that this cellobiose dehydrogenase may not functional in the degradation of cellulose and xylan but may be useful for degradation of other components of plant biomass, such as pectin or other aromatic substrates. interestingly, two endoglucanase genes  were also located in cluster  <dig>  which indicated that these two genes may not functional in the degradation of cellulose due to their low expressional levels in the cgep.fig.  <dig> comparison of different gene expression patterns induced by different substrates. gene expression patterns induced by xylan, cellulose and rice straw are compared to gene expression induced by sucrose , and gene expression patterns induced by rice straw are compared to those induced by cellulose . every point represents a gene with expression levels  that vary in  <dig> transcriptomes. blue points indicate genes that have no significant differences in  <dig> transcriptomes, red points indicate up-regulated genes and green points indicate down-regulated genes. the number of genes significantly up- or down-regulated in each transcriptome is reported in parentheses

to validate the transcriptomic results, all the predicted cellulase genes were investigated by qrt-pcr under the induction of cellulose, which confirmed the transcriptomic results . additionally, extracellular protein contents and total xylanase and cellulase activities of the  <dig> treatments  provide further evidences to the transcriptomic data .

the mfs includes  <dig> protein families,  <dig> of which are known to transport sugars  family, the oligosaccharide:h+ symporter  family, the fucose:h+ symporter  family, the sialate:h+ symporter  family, the polyol permease  family and the sugar efflux transporter  family), in addition, the glycoside-pentoside-hexuronide :cation symporter family is also responsible for sugars transportation  <cit> . totally, strain z <dig> has  <dig> sugar transporter genes distributed among sp, fhs, shs and gph families ,  <dig> genes were differently expressed in polysaccharides-induced samples when compared to sucrose control, the  <dig> genes which expression changed the most were predicted to transport glucose, xylose, lactose and maltose. three  and six sugar transporter genes  were only induced by xylan and cellulose, respectively. gene y699_ <dig> was up-regulated about  <dig> folds by both cellulose and rice straw, which is the homolog of a lactose permease gene  essential for cellulase induction in t. reesei v <dig>   <cit> . all the homologs of the  <dig> genes could be detected in other  <dig> filamentous fungi  even though n. crassa only has  <dig> sugar transporter genes, which indicated that filamentous fungi shared common mechanisms of sugar transportation.

strain z <dig> has  <dig> and  <dig> homologous genes with a. niger and n. crassa respectively. comparison of the transcriptomic data of z <dig>  a. niger  and n. crassa  under the induction of different polysaccharides  found that avicel- and rice straw-induced transcriptomic profiles of strain z <dig> were very similar, and orange peel power - and pectin-induced transcriptomic profiles of n. crassa were similar , however, the responses of the three fungi to the same polysaccharide were significantly different, xylan-induced transcriptomic profile of strain z <dig> was similar to avicel-induced gene transcriptomic profile of n. crassa. the  <dig> homologs of strain z <dig> and a. niger include  <dig> cazymes, some of which had the similar responses to the same polysaccharide , this trend was also observed between n. crassa and strain z <dig> . comparison of the straw induced transcriptomic profiles of different strains, transcription of  <dig> genes were significantly changed by the induction of rice straw in strain z <dig> when compared to sucrose, however, in a. niger and t. reesei, only  <dig> and  <dig> genes’ transcription were changed , respectively, by the induction of wheat straw  <cit> . among these differently expressed genes, only 154/ <dig> homologs were found between strain z <dig> and a. niger/t. reesei , and most of these homologs were cellulases, xylanases, sugar transporters and hypothetical proteins. in general, filamentous fungi showed the diverse performances to plant biomass in the whole transcriptome level, but they shared a fair amount of similarity on plant biomass degradation.fig.  <dig> comparison of different fungal expression profiles induced by polysaccharides. expression profiles induced by polysaccharides were compared between strain z <dig> and other two filamentous fungi, n. crassa and a. niger, by the method of detrended correspondence analysis. the percentages of the first two principal components explaining the expressional variations were given in axis tags. a expression profiles of  <dig> homologous genes were compared between strain z <dig> and n. crassa. af.x.16h, af.a.16h and af.r.16h: induction by xylan, avicel and rice straw respectively for  <dig> h in a. fumigatus z <dig>  nc.x.4h, nc.a.4h, nc.p.4h, nc.opp.4h and nc.noc.4h: induction by xylan, avicel, pectin, orange peel power and no carbon respectively for  <dig> h in n. crassa. b expression profiles of  <dig> homologous genes were compared between strain z <dig> and a. niger. an.w.6h and an.noc.6h: induction by wheat straw and no carbon respectively for  <dig> h in a. niger. an.noc.24h: induction by no carbon for  <dig> h in a. niger. c  <dig> homologous cazyme genes were compared between strain z <dig> and a. niger, which were induced by polysaccharides and no carbon . d  <dig> homologous cazyme genes were compared between strain z <dig> and n. crassa




go enrichment analysis
analysis of expression patterns in different treatments indicated that  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes were up-regulated or down-regulated in the xgep, rgep and cgep, respectively, in comparison to the sgep . a go term enrichment analysis of the three polysaccharide-induced gene expression patterns compared to the sgep was performed with the topgo r package   <cit> . xgep vs. sgep analysis showed enrichment of transmembrane transport , the d-xylose metabolic process , the xylan catabolic process  and the polysaccharide binding category . comparison of rgep with sgep indicated enrichment of transmembrane transport , the cellulose catabolic process , the xylan catabolic process , the pectin catabolic process  and the polysaccharide binding category . the comparison of cgep with sgep revealed enrichment of carbohydrate transport , the cellulose catabolic process , the hemicellulose metabolic process , the polysaccharide binding category  and ribosome biogenesis . together, these results show that a. fumigatus z <dig> could adjust its gene expression and metabolic pathways by using different substrates as a carbon source. when xylan was supplied, z <dig> had a higher expression level of xylanase genes and carbohydrate transporter genes, which could degrade xylan into xylobiose or xylose and then transport them into the cell. xylobiose and/or xylose could be utilized to produce energy or synthesize other materials in the d-xylose metabolic process. degradation enzymes, transporters and polysaccharide binding activity were also needed during the degradation of cellulose and rice straw. intriguingly, cgep showed enrichment of ribosome biogenesis, indicating that a. fumigatus z <dig> needs more ribosomes for protein synthesis. the protein products might be secreted into the external environment and contribute to the difficult process of crystalline cellulose degradation.

analysis of the transcriptome profiles across all scaffolds  indicated that the expression levels of most genes were stable, while significant changes occurred in and around cazyme-rich regions. a total of  <dig> genes were found in the  <dig> fragments; they ranged from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb in length, and all were up-regulated or down-regulated in at least  <dig> of the  <dig> transcriptomes . among these fragments, eight segments corresponding to eight different cazyme gene clusters were found, and five of them were up-regulated in all three transcriptomes compared to sgep, while the others were down-regulated. these results suggested that the genes in and around the eight cazyme gene clusters might be closely related to utilization of different carbon sources. additionally,  <dig> of the  <dig> secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters  in the genome were located or partly located in the co-regulated fragments. of those  <dig>  five were up-regulated, and the remainders were down-regulated. therefore, the secondary metabolism pathways might be stimulated in a. fumigatus z <dig> when the complex organic substances exist in the environment, enabling the strain z <dig> to fend off competition for nutrients and survive in complex environmental conditions.

filamentous fungi efficiently degrade plant biomass and secret substantial amounts of extracellular enzymes into their substrates. several model filamentous fungi, including n. crassa, t. reesei, a. niger, a. oryzae and a. nidulans, are widely used in industry and have been the subjects of numerous studies  <cit> . unlike the three model species in the aspergillus genus that have a long history of safe use for industrial enzyme production, a. fumigatus strains are opportunistic pathogens that may cause invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients  <cit> , although strains in this species are also effective at biomass degradation. a. fumigatus z <dig> was isolated from crop compost heaps  <cit> , suggesting that the strain is widely distributed in the environment and contributes to the degradation of plant biomass. there have been some studies related to polysaccharide degradation in aspergillus fumigatus  <cit> . this study on strain z <dig> showed that it has an abundant distribution of cazyme genes in genome and can produce large amount of extracellular enzymes, which make it possible to be a producer of enzymes to degrade plant biomass. also, as a fast growing filamentous fungus at a high temperature of  <dig> °c, strain z <dig> could easily be a host for heterologous protein expression by the mature molecular technologies in a. fumigatus. even though, strain z <dig> was not as good as some well-studied fungi, such as a. niger mgg <dig> with many genomic modifications  <cit> , but it shared a similar potential and results of the present study enable valuable resources for further explorations. the safety of this strain should be considered by knocking out some virulence-related genes, such as the genes for gliotoxin, fumagillin, aflatoxin and ribotoxin  <cit> .

in general, filamentous fungi cannot absorb polysaccharides directly into their cells to use as sources of carbon and energy. instead, they secrete many types of enzymes to depolymerize polysaccharides into monomeric carbohydrates that are efficiently taken up and metabolized. in eukaryotic cells, protein secretion involves er-associated translation, folding and glycosylation. proteins are then moved into the golgi apparatus or other compartments via vesicles to form the mature proteins. finally, within secretory vesicles, the mature proteins are transported to the cell membrane and secreted into the environment  <cit> . guillemette et al.  <cit>  reported transcriptional responses of a. niger when exposed to secretion stress . in total,  <dig> genes in the secretory pathway were induced by the three er-stress conditions. however, among the homologous counterparts of these  <dig> genes in a. fumigatus z <dig>  seven were down-regulated in all three treatments  when compared to the sucrose as a control condition . the same trend was observed among the important chaperones and foldases , which are involved in protein folding in the er, with the exception of a  <dig> -fold increase in bipa observed on cellulose. unfolded protein response  and er-associated degradation  were also not induced by the three polysaccharides. these results indicate that there was no er stress in these conditions compared to sucrose, even though more extracellular proteins were secreted  <cit> . two genes involved in glycosylation, the α- <dig>  2-mannosidase gene  and the α-glucosidase gene , exhibited  <dig> – <dig> -fold and 3– <dig> -fold increases, respectively, in the three treatments compared to sucrose control. it has been suggested that plant biomass-degrading enzymes are highly glycosylated  <cit> . our study indicates that when polysaccharides are the sole substrate for growth, high levels of extracellular enzymes do not cause er stress. indeed, it suggested that if the balance between growth and protein secretion of fungi is managed well, the secretory pathway can be fully explored, and fold-increased production of extracellular proteins can be achieved.

xlnr is a xylanolytic transcriptional activator specific to fungi  <cit>  that effects a wide range of target genes, e.g., genes encoding xylan-degrading enzymes or the enzymes in the d-xylose metabolic pathway  <cit>  and even genes encoding cellobiohydrolases and endocellulases  <cit> . in this study, the xlnr gene was significantly up-regulated by cellulose and rice straw but not by xylan. andersen et al.  <cit>  reported that in the fermentations of glucose and xylose,  <dig> conserved genes were differentially transcribed  in three aspergillus species  when xylose, rather than glucose, was the substrate. enzymes involved in d-xylose metabolism were among the  <dig> genes. in the present study, homologs of the  <dig> up-regulated genes were mostly transcribed at high levels in the three treatments compared with sucrose control . however, the results indicated that d-xylose metabolism was not activated by xlnr because its transcriptional level was similar in xylan and sucrose, even though the d-xylose metabolic pathway was significantly induced in xylan. the down-regulated gene identified by andersen et al. encoded a mfs monosaccharide transporter, which was reported to have a higher affinity for glucose than xylose in their results. the expression level of the homolog gene decreased considerably in the three polysaccharides treatments of this study, suggesting that either the cellulose and rice straw treatments did not have enough glucose to induce the transporter gene or cellulose was transported into cells mainly as a form of cellobiose rather than glucose  <cit> . another interesting finding in the  <dig> genes is that a sugar transporter  had a extremely high expression level in xylan and rice straw  but only a  <dig> -folds enhanced in cellulose, which revealed that this sugar transporter should be a specific transporter of the hydrolyzing products from xylan in all four aspergillus species .

transcriptomic data showed that genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes involved in plant cell wall degradation were repressed during growth on sucrose. carbon catabolite repression  is an important mechanism to repress the production of polysaccharide-degrading enzymes during growth on easily metabolized carbon sources. in most fungal species, ccr is mediated by a zinc-finger transcription factor crea , which is a repressor for genes encoding polysaccharide-degrading enzymes. in this study, we expected to have low crea expression levels in the  <dig> polysaccharides treatments when compared to sucrose treatment. however, the crea gene was transcribed at high levels , with  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold increases in rice straw and cellulose compared to sucrose, respectively. reverse transcription quantitative pcr  experiments under the same conditions as the transcriptomic study confirmed these observations . these results suggest that crea has functions beyond those of a transcription repressor and merits further research.

our previous research identified many plant biomass-degrading enzymes secreted by z <dig> in the presence of different carbon sources   <cit> . the expression of those enzymes in the present study is consistent with the findings of the previous study. additionally, xylanase genes were induced more by cellulose and rice straw than by xylan; xylan was not the best inducer of its own hydrolytic enzymes. we observed that cultivation broth containing xylan became transparent, while culture filtrates with avicel or rice straw still had unused substrates after  <dig> h of incubation, indicating that pure xylan was depolymerized faster than avicel and rice straw; our previous work showed that z <dig> has very strong xylanase activities  <cit> . we conclude that the simple carbon source, xylose, which is released by xylan degradation, inhibited the persistent high expression of many xylanases. this may also account for the smaller transcriptional differences between the xylan treatment and sucrose control than those observed when either cellulose or rice straw treatments are compared to the control.

CONCLUSIONS
this study performed transcriptional analysis on an a. fumigatus strain grown on xylan, cellulose and rice straw. it comprehensively described natural polysaccharide saccharification by a. fumigatus hydrolases and the regulation of gene expression that occurs during this process. having identified enzymes actively involved in biomass degradation, we foresee the potential to increase enzyme activities in industrial contexts. this would first require the heterologous expression of the enzymes at high levels and optimization of their incorporation into enzymatic cocktails. the genome and transcriptome data of this study are also valuable for future studies of aspergillosis.
