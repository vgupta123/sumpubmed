BACKGROUND
three protein complexes that are conserved from yeast to humans, the 19s proteasome lid, the csn, and eif <dig>  contain subunits characterized by two protein motifs: the mpn  and the pci  domains  <cit> . the proteasome 20s catalytic particle and the 19s regulatory subunit cooperate in degrading polyubiquitylated proteins . the 19s proteasome can be separated into the base complex, which binds and unfolds substrates  <cit> , and the eight subunit lid complex, which cleaves ubiquitin from substrates, thus apparently facilitating the entry of substrates into the catalytic proteasome barrel  <cit> .

in higher eukaryotes, the subunits of the 19s lid show pair-wise similarity to the eight subunits of the csn  <cit> . in vivo, csn promotes the activity of cullin-ring ubiquitin ligases  <cit> , multiprotein complexes containing cullins, the ring protein rbx <dig>  and one of several hundred substrate-specific adaptors  <cit> . the mpn domain containing csn subunit  <dig> harbors a protease motif  <cit>  that cleaves the ubiquitin-related peptide nedd <dig> from cullins  <cit> . this activity, acting in concert with the csn-associated deubiquitylation enzyme ubp <dig>  was proposed to promote cullin function by facilitating the recruitment of labile substrate adaptors  <cit> .

the third pci/mpn complex, eif <dig>  is more distantly related to csn and the 19s lid . whereas human eif <dig> consists of up to  <dig> subunits, consecutively named eif3a – l and ga <dig>  <cit> , budding yeast contains only six to eight subunits . five of these subunits are orthologs of human eif3a, b, c, g, and eif3i  <cit>  and appear to constitute a conserved core complex  <cit> . fission yeast contains the same five core subunits, in addition to the non-core subunits eif3d/moe1p, eif3e/int6p, and eif3h  <cit> . a putative eif3f ortholog was also identified, but biochemical evidence confirming it as an authentic eif <dig> subunit functioning in protein synthesis is still outstanding  <cit> .

eif <dig> is the most complex translation initiation factor and plays at least two important roles in protein synthesis. first, eif <dig> binds to the 40s ribosome and facilitates loading of the met-trna/eif2· gtp ternary complex to form the 43s preinitiation complex. subsequently, eif <dig> apparently assists eif <dig> in recruiting mrnas to the 43s complex. a critical in vivo function of eif <dig> core subunits in these processes was indicated by the lethality of the respective budding yeast deletion strains  <cit> . in contrast, in fission yeast, the non-core subunits eif3d and eif3e are not essential for viability or global protein synthesis  <cit> . it was therefore proposed that distinct subclasses of eif <dig> complexes, containing different combinations of core and non-core subunits, may regulate specific subsets of mrnas in fission yeast  <cit> . our study provides the first experimental evidence substantiating this hypothesis by demonstrating that biochemically distinct eif <dig> complexes defined by the pci domain proteins eif3e and eif3m  associate with different sets of mrnas.

RESULTS
both csn <dig> and csn7b are essential genes
csn complexes of higher eukaryotes typically contain eight distinct subunits . however, in fission yeast only six subunits are known , none of which are essential for viability  <cit> . we noticed two genes in the schizosaccharomyces pombe genome database, originally annotated as csn <dig>  and csn7b , which encode mpn and pci domain containing proteins with considerable similarity to metazoan csn <dig> and csn7b, respectively . in order to determine whether these genes might function in the known biochemical pathways regulated by csn, cullin deneddylation and ubp12p-mediated deubiquitylation  <cit> , we deleted csn <dig> and csn7b in wild-type diploid cells. upon sporulation and tetrad analysis, only two viable spores could be recovered in each case, both of which were uracil auxotroph . thus, unlike the genes encoding the six known subunits of the fission yeast csn  <cit> , csn <dig> and csn7b are essential.

csn6p and csn7bp associate with eif <dig> components
to elucidate the essential functions of csn6p and csn7bp, we sought to identify their interacting proteins. to this end, we attempted to modify csn <dig> and csn7b at their endogenous genomic loci with five consecutive protein a epitope tags . the c-terminal tag also contained a cleavage site for tobacco etch virus  protease upstream of the protein a moieties. diploid analysis indicated that c-terminal tagging destroyed the essential function of csn <dig> . in contrast, a csn7b-proa haploid strain was viable and did not display any obvious phenotypes . this indicated that the tagged allele was functional. total protein lysate from the csn7b-proa haploid strain was absorbed to immunoglobulin g  resin and specifically retained proteins were eluted with sodium dodecyl sulfate  or by cleavage with tev protease. the two eluates were resolved by gel electrophoresis and csn7bp-proa interacting proteins were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight  mass spectrometry.

both eluates contained an identical set of proteins. in addition to csn6p, the csn7bp complex contained the eif <dig> core subunits eif3a, b, c, and i, as well as the non-core subunit eif3h . the eif3g core subunit was not detected using maldi-tof in this purification, but was detected in an independent purification of the csn7bp complex using the more sensitive method of nano-liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry . however, eif3e and eif3d, two previously described components of s. pombe eif <dig>  <cit>  were consistently absent from the csn7bp complex when analyzed either by maldi-tof or by lc-ms/ms .

notably, no authentic csn subunits were found in the csn7bp complex, consistent with the previous demonstration that s. pombe csn contains only six non-essential subunits  <cit> . structural analysis indicated that csn6p is not only related to human csn <dig>  but shows a slightly greater overall similarity to human eif3f . based on the functional characterization described below , fission yeast csn6p therefore appears to be the ortholog of human eif3f.

a csn7bp ortholog is not known in the human eif <dig>  although the recently identified subunit ga <dig>  <cit>  shows considerable similarity to csn7bp . in addition, interactions of metazoan csn <dig> with eif <dig> subunits have previously been observed  <cit> . with regards to the unified nomenclature of eif <dig> subunits  <cit> , we propose eif3m as a more appropriate name for the novel fission yeast eif <dig> subunit encoded by csn7b . throughout this manuscript, we will use the proposed new names for the eif3f and eif3m genes and their products. the original annotations have recently been revised by the curator of the s. pombe genome database, in order to reflect the findings presented here.

the eif3f and eif3m proteins are primarily cytoplasmic
the evidence presented above suggested that eif3f and eif3m are essential subunits of s. pombe eif <dig>  to substantiate this possibility, we determined the subcellular localization of eif3f and eif3m. if these proteins were authentic eif <dig> subunits involved in protein synthesis, they should assume a subcellular localization similar to known eif <dig> subunits. we therefore prepared three strains with green fluorescent protein  tagged alleles of eif3b, eif3e, and eif3m integrated into their respective genomic loci. in addition, since c-terminal gfp-tagging destroyed the essential function of the small eif3f protein, we prepared a strain mildly overexpressing n-terminally gfp-tagged eif3f from a prep <dig> plasmid. fluorescence microscopy of live cells revealed that all four proteins were primarily localized in the cytoplasm , which would be consistent with a function in protein translation. in contrast, csn subunits are largely nuclear in fission yeast .

eif3f and eif3m are required for global protein synthesis
to directly assess the potential role of eif3f and eif3m in protein synthesis, we prepared haploid eif3f and eif3m deletion strains maintained viable by plasmids driving the regulated expression of eif3f and eif3m, respectively. expression from these plasmids could be turned off by the addition of thiamin to the growth media, resulting in a strong reduction in protein levels within  <dig> to  <dig> hours . coincident with shut-off of eif3f and eif3m expression, global cellular protein synthesis was diminished by ~80%, as determined by metabolic labeling with 35s-methionine .

further biochemical analysis by sucrose gradient velocity centrifugation revealed a strong reduction in the formation of polysomes in eif3f and eif3m mutants following promoter shut-off . in contrast, as described previously  <cit> , eif3e mutants showed only a minor reduction in total protein synthesis  and essentially normal polysomes .

the conserved cullin deneddylation function of csn was not impaired either in eif3f and eif3m mutants or in eif3e mutants, since cullin  <dig>  did not accumulate exclusively in the neddylated form as it does in csn <dig> deletion strains . similarly, unlike in csn <dig> mutants , csn/ubp12p-mediated inhibition of cul1p in vitro ubiquitin ligase activity was not impaired upon shut-off of either eif3f or eif3m expression. cul1p neddylation and activity were also unaffected in eif3e mutants . these data suggested that eif3f and eif3m are bona fide subunits of fission yeast eif <dig> but not csn, performing essential functions in protein synthesis similar to eif <dig> core subunits.

the eif3m and eif3e proteins define distinct eif <dig> complexes
although the purification of the eif3m complex robustly retrieved roughly stoichiometric amounts of known eif <dig> subunits, two subunits, eif3d and eif3e, were conspicuously absent . to exclude the possibility that we had overlooked these subunits because they were obscured by the igg bands, we affinity-purified eif3e-associated proteins from an eif3e-proa strain. the retrieved proteins were identified using maldi-tof mass spectrometry as before.

like the eif3m complex, the eif3e complex contained roughly stoichiometric amounts of the eif <dig> core subunits a, b, c, g, and i . in addition, eif3f was present while, unexpectedly, eif3m and eif3h were missing. we did not detect the proteasome lid subunit rpn5p, which previously had been shown to associate with eif3e and eif3d  <cit> . this observation indicated that the described eif3d/eif3e/rpn5p interaction is either unstable under our purification conditions or contains only a minor fraction of the total eif3e engaged in protein interactions.

these results raised the intriguing possibility that fission yeast contains two distinct eif <dig> complexes that comprise an overlapping set of core subunits, but are distinguished by the presence of either the essential pci protein eif3m and the mpn domain protein eif3h or the non-essential pci protein eif3e and its binding partner eif3d. to exclude the possibility that our mass spectrometry analysis missed substoichiometric amounts of eif3d in the eif3m complex, we analyzed eif3m complexes by immunoblotting with eif3d antisera. whereas eif3d was readily detectable in the eif3e complex, it was undetectable in the eif3m complex . in the reciprocal experiment, eif3d antibodies co-immunoprecipitated eif3e-13myc, but not eif3m-13myc or csn5p-13myc .

to exclude the possibility that our cell lysis or affinity purification conditions led to uncontrolled release of eif <dig> subunits, thus mimicking the existence of distinct subcomplexes, we performed a purification using the protein a-tagged eif3b core subunit as bait. as determined by lc-ms/ms performed on excised bands detected in the complex upon page separation, the eif3b complex contained all known eif <dig> core components as well as eif3f and eif3m . the eif3e and eif3d proteins were also present, albeit in clearly substoichiometric amounts. these findings indicate that purification of eif3b resulted in the copurification of the distinct eif3m- and eif3e-containing complexes. taken together, these data strongly suggested the existence of two distinct eif <dig> complexes defined by the pci proteins eif3m and eif3e.

the eif3m and eif3e proteins associate with distinct sets of mrnas
the finding that eif3m is essential, whereas eif3e is dispensable, suggested the possibility that the different eif <dig> complexes they define regulate different subsets of mrnas. to approach this, we sought to identify mrnas specifically associated with the eif3m and eif3e complexes. the complexes were affinity-purified as described above in the presence of rnase inhibitors, and the associated rna was extracted, amplified, and converted to cy3-labeled cdna as described in the methods section. the cy3-labeled cdna was hybridized competitively with cy5-labeled cdna prepared from total rna onto microarrays representing all  <dig> predicted s. pombe open reading frames  and rnas. based on the background subtracted hybridization signals, eif3-associated mrnas were ranked according to their factor of enrichment in the eif3m and eif3e complexes over a mock purified sample .

the microarray analysis suggested a global role for eif3m and a more restricted function of eif3e in translation. using an arbitrary cut-off value of three-fold enrichment over mock, eif3m associated with  <dig> different mrnas, whereas eif3e associated with only  <dig> distinct species . we observed  <dig> mrnas enriched more than three-fold in both samples. . in addition, our analysis revealed  <dig> mrnas uniquely enriched in the eif3e complex, whereas  <dig> transcripts were uniquely enriched in the eif3m complex .

a ranked list of all  <dig> mrnas that were uniquely enriched more than three-fold in the eif3e complex was assembled . approximately 75% of these mrnas fell into one of three categories: mrnas encoding proteins involved in intermediary metabolism , those encoding proteins involved in protein metabolism , and those encoding proteins with unknown functions . the remainder was distributed roughly equally among four categories: mrnas encoding proteins involved in nucleic acid metabolism, those encoding proteins involved in transcription, those encoding transporter proteins, and those encoding unclassified proteins.

a corresponding list of the  <dig> most highly enriched mrnas exclusively present in the eif3m complex  revealed that ~58% also fell into three categories: mrnas encoding proteins involved in nucleic acid metabolism , those encoding transporter proteins , and those encoding proteins of unknown function . the remainder was roughly equally distributed among four categories: mrnas encoding proteins involved in intermediary metabolism, those mrnas encoding proteins involved in protein metabolism, those encoding proteins involved in transcription, and those encoding unclassified proteins .

to exclude the possibility that our affinity purification protocol unspecifically enriched highly expressed mrnas, we averaged the data from the three competively hybridized samples of total s. pombe cdna to determine the relative expression rank of each mrna . a plot of expression rank vs. factor of enrichment of the  <dig> mrnas most enriched in the eif3e and eif3m complexes revealed that the eif3m complex contained mrnas that were distributed equally over the entire range of expression levels. in contrast, the eif3e complex was enriched for rare mrnas . the lack of a linear correlation between mrna expression level and enrichment in the eif3e and eif3m complexes argues against unspecific copurification of abundant mrnas.

specific association of mrnas with eif3m and eif3e complexes
to validate the results from the microarray hybridizations, we chose several mrnas at random from each list of  <dig> and used rt-pcr to confirm their interactions with the respective eif <dig> complexes. eif3e-proa- and eif3m-proa-associated complexes were affinity-purified as before and separated by page. both complexes showed the same differential subunit composition as described above . the associated rna was purified, split into equal portions, and employed in rt-pcr reactions with gene-specific primer pairs.

the rt-pcr analysis of a total of fourteen mrnas included eight mrnas identified in the eif3e complex, five mrnas identified in the eif3m complex, and one mrna found to be associated with both complexes with similar enrichment factors. these mrnas varied widely in their factors of enrichment and their enrichment ranks as indicated in fig. 5b. without exception, all eight mrnas found to be enriched in the eif3e complex by microarray analysis were also found preferentially associated with this complex by rt-pcr . based on this result, we calculate a false positive rate of less than  <dig>  with a 95% confidence interval of  <dig>  –  <dig> . whereas mrnas with a high enrichment factor  appeared to be exclusively associated with eif3e-proa , those with a lower enrichment factor  also displayed a low amount of association with the eif3m complex . conversely, all five mrnas highly enriched in the eif3m complex as determined by microarray analysis  were almost exclusively bound to this complex when analyzed by rt-pcr .

notably, the mrna encoding the proteasome subunit rpn5p, which was found in both complexes by microarray analysis with similar enrichment factors  was also confirmed as being associated with both eif <dig> complexes by rt-pcr . these results strongly suggest that the eif3m and eif3e complexes specifically associate with distinct sets of mrnas.

discussion
pci proteins define distinct eif <dig> complexes
our results show that csn6p and csn7bp are subunits of fission yeast eif <dig>  csn6p was shown to be the eif3f subunit conserved in all eukaryotes except budding yeast. consistent with this finding, eif3f has previously been found to be associated with eif3g, although the role of eif3f in protein synthesis had not been examined  <cit> . our study further identified two distinct eif <dig> complexes defined by the pci proteins eif3e and eif3m . no direct equivalent of eif3m is apparent in eif <dig> preparations from other eukaryotes. considering the essential function of eif3m in protein synthesis in fission yeast, it is possible that other pci proteins substitute for eif3m in other organisms.

consistent with this idea is the finding that the pci domain containing ga <dig>  a recently identified protein copurifying with human eif <dig>  <cit> , shows more similarity to eif3m than to any other pci protein . in addition, the pci domain containing csn subunits  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were found to interact with eif <dig> subunits in arabidopsis thaliana and in human cells  <cit> . in addition, pci8p/csn11p, a non-essential pci subunit of the budding yeast csn  <cit> , copurifies with essential eif <dig> core subunits  <cit> . although the functional significance of these interactions is still unclear, our findings raise the intriguing possibility that they define multiple subclasses of distinct eif <dig> complexes. whereas fission yeast appears to rely on an essential eif <dig> complex classified by eif3m and a non-essential complex specified by eif3e, higher eukaryotes may divide the task of mrna translation among a multitude of eif <dig> complexes. since the individual pci proteins defining these subcomplexes are expected to be present in substoichiometric amounts relative to core components, as is eif3e in the s. pombe core complex, they may have escaped detection in bulk eif <dig> preparations from higher eukaryotes.

distinct eif <dig> complexes and translational specificity
although our finding of distinct eif <dig> complexes that associate with different sets of mrnas was surprising, circumstantial evidence pointing to their existence was provided in previous studies. for example, fission yeast eif3e copurifies with eif <dig> core subunits, and yet, unlike core subunits, eif3e is not required for global protein synthesis or viability. two competing models were proposed to explain the pleiotropic phenotype of eif3e deletion mutants, which includes slow growth in minimal media and meiotic defects  <cit> . in the first model, eif3e regulates the translation of all transcripts, but rare mrnas may be more affected by a fractional reduction in translation efficiency and thus give rise to distinct phenotypes. in the second model, eif3e regulates the translation of a specific subset of mrnas encoding proteins whose depletion leads to distinct phenotypes but not lethality. the findings presented here strongly favor the second model.

our microarray analysis revealed  <dig> mrnas uniquely enriched in the eif3e complex, many being rare, whereas  <dig> transcripts were uniquely enriched in the eif3m complex. the latter finding is consistent with the severe protein synthesis defect and lethality of eif3m deletion mutants. whereas these mrna lists were based on an arbitrary cut-off value of three-fold enrichment over mock, this criterion proved stringent enough to confirm specific association with their respective eif <dig> complexes of all  <dig> mrnas retested by rt-pcr. thus, since we calculate the false positive rate to be less than  <dig>  with 95% confidence interval  <dig>  –  <dig> , the maximum number of mrnas listed potentially false positively as enriched in the eif3e complex would be  <dig> out of  <dig> .

however, we consider it unlikely that all mrnas found enriched in the eif3e complex are exclusive translational targets of this complex, because the cellular phenotypes of eif3e mutants are rather discrete. although many of the eif3e-associated mrnas encode essential proteins, viability, global protein synthesis, and polysome formation are not affected in these mutants when they are grown in rich media . it is therefore likely that eif3m or other pci domain proteins can deputize for eif3e in many cases. in fact, our microarray study revealed that a substantial portion of eif3e-associated mrnas was also recovered in the eif3m complex . nonetheless, we strongly suspect that inefficient translation of a limited set of eif3e-associated mrnas contributes to distinct cellular phenotypes found in eif3e mutants .

the eif3e protein and translational control during stress response
the eif3e mutants display marked sensitivity to a wide variety of cellular stresses, such as osmotic stress, nutrient starvation, and low temperature  <cit>  in addition, eif3e mutants show synthetic lethality with proteasome mutants, which are presumed to accumulate a large load of misfolded proteins  <cit> . conversely, overexpression of eif3e confers resistance to a broad spectrum of unrelated drugs, whose only commonality appears to be that they induce cellular stress  <cit> . overexpression of eif3e also activates genes involved in stress defense, such as thioredoxin  <cit> . interestingly, the mrna encoding thioredoxin was also identified as a putative translational target of eif3e . finally, eif3e undergoes relocalization into cytoplasmic foci in response to heat and osmotic stress, thus implicating it in stress regulation  <cit> .

global protein synthesis is actively switched off in response to cellular stress and nutrient deprivation . this shut-off protects cells from proteotoxicity by relieving chaperones of their load of unfolded client proteins, conserving amino acids for other essential functions, and attenuating the metabolic consequences of protein synthesis. however, long-term adaptation to stress conditions, repair and recovery require synthesis of new stress-induced proteins. during the stress response, some mrnas must be translated in the presence of a repressed general translation machinery, suggesting that select eifs can escape the global repression. our studies raise the intriguing possibility that the eif3e complex has such a specialized function during stress response. lack of eif3e may prevent stress-induced synthesis of its critical translational targets, thus leading to the known stress sensitivity of the mutant. substantial additional work will be required to address this possibility.

potential mechanisms underlying mrna discrimination by eif <dig> complexes
several lines of evidence have begun to implicate other general translation factors, including eif <dig> and eif <dig>  in translational specificity  <cit> . importantly, these factors are downstream of important signaling cascades, including the nutrient-sensing tor pathway and a variety of stress-induced kinases . although the details of these regulatory mechanisms are beginning to emerge, it is still unclear exactly how eif <dig> and eif <dig> contribute to mrna specificity.

since eif <dig> cooperates with the cap-binding eif <dig> complex in directing the 5' end of mrnas to the 40s ribosome, and several eif <dig> subunits contain rna binding motifs, our data is consistent with a model in which eif <dig> complexes defined by distinct pci proteins recognize determining features of mrnas presented to the 40s subunit in concert with eif <dig>  in agreement with this idea is the recent finding that the human pci protein eif3a specifically facilitates the translation of the mrna encoding ribonucleotide reductase m <dig>  <cit> . in addition, a. thaliana eif3h, a non-core subunit, was recently shown to be specifically required for efficient translation of the transcription factor atb <dig>  <cit> .

while we have so far been unsuccessful in identifying common sequence elements within the upstream regions of mrnas enriched in the eif3e complex , this analysis was severely hampered by the fact that 5'utrs are poorly defined in s. pombe. it is therefore still possible that critical features, including secondary structure determinants, lie within the 5'utr or other regions of eif3e-associated mrnas. substantial additional work will be required to delineate the exact mechanism of how eif3e may contribute to the translation of specific mrnas and the potential impact of this mechanism on human cancers defective in int6/eif3e  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we provide biochemical evidence for the existence of two distinct eif <dig> complexes in fission yeast. these complexes contain an overlapping set of subunits, but are distinguished by the pci proteins eif3e and eif3m. based on the finding that the distinct eif <dig> complexes associate with different mrnas, we propose that they have different translational specificities.
