BACKGROUND
network approaches provide a means to bridge the gap from individual genes to complex traits. methods for inferring gene interactions from expression data have been an active area of systems biology research  <cit> . gene set enrichment analysis  determines whether an a priori defined set of genes shows statistically significant differences between two biological states  <cit> . in contrast, weighted gene co-expression network analysis  constructs gene sets  from the observed gene expression data. these modules are then related to gene ontology information to study their biological plausibility and to eliminate spurious modules due to technical artifacts. although wgcna shares the philosophy of gsea by focusing on gene sets as opposed to individual genes, it does not make use of a priori defined gene sets  <cit> . instead, modules are constructed from the expression data by using unsupervised clustering. although it is advisable to relate the resulting modules to gene ontology information for assessing their biological plausibility, it is not required. wgcna has been successfully applied to identify brain cancer genes  <cit> , to characterize genes related to body weight in mice  <cit> , and to study atherosclerosis  <cit> .

wgcna alleviates the multiple testing problem inherent in microarray data analysis. instead of relating thousands of genes to the trait, wgcna relates only a few modules. because the modules may correspond to biological pathways, focusing the analysis on modules amounts to a biologically motivated data reduction scheme. if genetic marker data are available, one can use genetic marker-based causality tests to identify the genetic drivers underlying the modules of interest. the concept of conducting a causality analysis based on genetic marker data has been explored by several authors  <cit> . we refer to a weighted gene co-expression network analysis that uses genetic markers in causality testing as "marker integrated wgcna" or simply as "iwgcna".

iwgcna relies on correlation measures to relate gene expression profiles, genetic markers and clinical traits. using a correlation measure affords a truly unified approach for relating variables from disparate data sets. we demonstrate iwgcna on a chronic fatigue syndrome  data set and show that it identifies candidate genes whose functions are consistent with results from other cfs studies.

background on chronic fatigue syndrome
chronic fatigue syndrome  is a major public health problem that affects more than one million people in the us  <cit> . cfs is defined as debilitating fatigue of at least six months duration accompanied by at least four of the following case defining symptoms: post exertional fatigue lasting longer than  <dig> hours, unrefreshing sleep, diffculty concentrating or remembering, headaches unusual in frequency or duration, muscle pain, joint pain, sore throat and tender lymph nodes  <cit> . cfs has been associated with similar debilitating conditions such as fibromyalgia, connective tissue disease and mitochondrial deficiency  <cit> . cfs has been shown to affect the endocrine, muscular and immune systems  <cit>  and some cases may be triggered by viruses  <cit> . while there is no consistent cause, evidence for immune and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis abnormalities have been observed at the symptom, molecular and genetic level of cfs patients  <cit> .

several groups have found higher cytotoxic t-cell counts and impaired t-cell function in cfs patients in comparison to controls  <cit> . there has also been compelling evidence for higher rates of immune cell apoptosis in cfs patients, specifically neutrophils and peripheral blood lymphocytes  <cit> . the hpa axis is a feedback system that mediates glucocorticoid hormones  and serotonin and is closely linked to the immune system. it is thought that a dysfunctional hpa axis might be linked to cfs  <cit> . subclasses of cfs have been associated with polymorphisms in genes that function in the hpa axis nr3c <dig>  tph <dig> and maoa  <cit> .

while molecular profiles and genetic variants within genes related to the immune system and the hpa axis have been shown to be associated with cfs  <cit>  there is a need to gain a systems level understanding of the disease. standard gene mapping techniques are not designed to identify pathways underlying complex traits, which exhibit genetic heterogeneity involving many small-effect genes. the quest to determine the genetic etiology of cfs is further obfuscated by diagnostic errors, phenotypic heterogeneity and in some cases environmental effects.

recent systems genetic strategies that characterize interactions between genotype data and co-expression modules have successfully been applied to complex diseases  <cit> . here we present the iwgcna approach for integrating a weighted gene co-expression network with snp data to identify a disease-related module and to develop a systems genetic gene-screening strategy that generates testable hypotheses. furthermore, we use the network edge orienting  software to show that this screening strategy selects genes that are causal for the module  <cit> . our analysis identifies novel genes associated with cfs severity that are causal drivers for a severity-related module. gene ontology software indicates that iwgcna identifies clinically relevant biological pathways and genes.

RESULTS
the fundamental tenets of iwgcna are to find gene expressions that are 1) significantly related to the clinical trait, 2) highly connected "hub" genes in a disease related co-expression module and 3) significantly associated with a disease-related genetic marker. we apply this approach to a chronic fatigue syndrome  data set consisting of microarray, snp, and trait data . as our analysis of this data set consists of several steps working with different subsets of data, we provide a flow chart overview in figure  <dig> and begin with an outline of iwgcna. we then present results from our analysis of the cfs data and compare them to the results obtained from a standard analysis approach that ignores the snp data. finally, we show that iwgcna identifies functionally relevant candidate genes that are causal drivers for their trait-related parent module.

step 1: construct a co-expression network and modules
we define co-expression networks as undirected, weighted gene networks. the nodes of such a network correspond to gene expression profiles, and edges between genes are determined by the pairwise correlations between gene expressions. network construction was performed using our freely available customized r software functions  <cit> . the absolute value of the pearson correlation coefficient is calculated for all pair-wise comparisons of gene-expression values across all microarray samples. the correlation matrix is then transformed into a weighted undirected network  by raising the absolute value of each entry to a power β. high values of β emphasize high correlations at the expense of low correlations. unlike unweighted networks that use a hard threshold to dichotomize the correlation matrix, the soft thresholding of weighted gene co-expression networks preserves the continuous nature of the gene co-expression information, leading to highly robust results and allowing for a simple geometric interpretation of network concepts  <cit> .

the next step is to organize the genes into clusters or modules. toward this end we use topological overlap, which is a robust measure of interconnectedness  <cit> . the  entry in the topological overlap matrix reflects a shared connectivity pattern between genes xi and xj. average linkage hierarchical clustering is then used to cluster the genes into modules using the topological overlap dissimilarity measure  <cit> . several centrality measures have been proposed in the literature  <cit> . here we focus on centrality  measures that are useful within the wgcna context. whole network connectivity k is the sum of the connection strengths between a particular gene xi and all other genes in the network k=∑j∈n,j≠i|cor|β, where n refers to the set of network genes. intramodular connectivity kq is another measure which is more meaningful for our module-based analysis. it is computed from the sum of the connection strengths between a particular gene and all other genes in the module kq=∑j∈q,j≠i|cor|β, where q refers to a specific module. another measure of connectivity is the module eigengene-based connectivity kmeq, which is computed from the absolute value of a gene expression xi within the q-th module and its first principal component or "q-th module eigengene", meq. specifically, kmeq = |cor|, where larger values indicate greater similarity between a gene xiand the q-th module eigengene. one can show that the module eigengene-based connectivity measure is highly correlated with intramodular connectivity  <cit> , but a theoretical advantage of kmeq is that its definition can be easily extended to expression profiles outside the module. another advantage of kmeq is that a simple correlation test p-value can be used to assess the statistical significance of the relationship between xi and me.

step 2: find clinical trait-related modules
to incorporate external information into the co-expression network, we first define a measure of gene significance . abstractly speaking, the higher the i-th gene's |gs|, the greater its biological significance. for example, gs could encode pathway membership , knockout essentiality, or the correlation with an external microarray sample trait. a gene significance measure could also be defined by minus log of a p-value. the only requirement is that a gene significance of  <dig> indicates that the gene is not significant with regard to the biological question of interest.

we define gsseverity as the absolute value of the correlation between the cfs severity phenotype and the i-th gene expression xi: gsseverity = |cor|. a correlation test can be used to assign a statistical significance level  to gsseverity. note that a β power of gene significance, |cor|β, can be interpreted as the connection strength between severity and the i-th gene expression in a weighted network. to arrive at a measure of module significance, we average the gsseverity values of all genes within a module. alternatively, one could define a module significance measure by correlating the trait with the module eigengene  <cit> . subsequent analyses focus on the module that is most related to the clinical trait of interest.

step 3: prioritizing gene expressions with a snp marker
this step requires a snp marker that is associated with both the trait and the trait-related module. to measure the association between a snp and the gene expression profiles we define a snp-based gene significance measure gssnp = |cor|. in our application we use a correlation test to compute the corresponding p-value for gssnp. gssnp is similar to a single point lod score, as it measures the extent to which a gene is associated with the snp.

step 4: using network connectivity and genetic information to find candidate genes
while a standard gene screening approach would draft a final list of candidate genes based solely on the association between gene expression and the clinical trait , our integrated screening strategy additionally uses gssnp, and kme. this approach allows us to select disease related genes that are implicated by the genetic marker and network connectivity information.

step 5: network edge orienting analysis to determine causal drivers of module
we use the network edge orienting  software to produce edge orienting scores which allow us to determine whether a candidate gene is causal or reactive to its parent module  <cit> . since we use a single genetic marker as a causal anchor, we use the leo.nb.singlemarker score to evaluate the causal edge xi → me, where xi is the expression profile of the i-th candidate gene and me is the module eigengene. genes with a causal relationship to their parent module are highly related to many other genes within the module and are upstream of the module expressions.

the systems genetic analysis described in steps 1– <dig> results in a biologically motivated gene screening strategy. pathway analysis and additional data sets can then be used to support and/or prioritize the resulting candidate genes.

an iwgcna of chronic fatigue syndrome
in the following sections, we apply the iwgcna to a chronic fatigue syndrome  data set consisting of phenotype, genotype and expression data from the centers for disease control  <cit> . the cfs patients studied here were a subset of a  <dig> patient cohort from wichita, ks collected between december  <dig> and july  <dig>  <cit> . details on the cfs severity measure as well as other diagnostic criteria are included in the methods section.

defining co-expression network modules and relating them to the cfs trait data
starting with the  <dig> most varying genes  described in the methods section, we selected the 30% most connected  for our network analysis. wgcna identified five modules of co-expressed genes. figure  <dig> shows a cluster tree of the gene network, where the five color-coded modules correspond to branches of this tree. the color band underneath the tree depicts the branches , and grey denotes the genes outside of the modules . a classical multi-dimensional scaling plot illustrates the relative positions of the module genes . next, we related our five modules to the severity trait to identify the module with the strongest association. figure  <dig> shows that the blue module with  <dig> genes has the highest module significance in  all samples ,  males and  females. as a result, we focused on this module in the following analyses.

modules facilitate a molecular characterization of gender differences
since cfs is four times more likely to occur in women than in men  <cit> , it is possible that there are genetic differences between men and women regarding cfs severity. furthermore, women outnumber men three to one in this data set, so without considering gender in our analysis, results could be skewed toward severity related alleles that are more important in women. to ensure that our analysis produced gene candidates related to cfs severity in both sexes, we stratified the analysis by sex.

before relating the blue module genes to severity and the snp data, we investigated whether the network model was preserved when the data was stratified by sex. we compared the gsseverity values between males and females  and found a weak correlation . however, the blue module was associated with cfs severity in both men and women independently and in the samples combined. furthermore, there was a high correlation  between the kmeblue values of the male and female networks . the importance of the blue module in both genders and the preservation of the module membership measure kmeblue demonstrate the value of using network properties to screen for genes.

using the module eigengene to homogenize the female samples
to eliminate heterogeneous samples from the female data set, we made use of the fact that the blue module eigengene  was significantly correlated with cfs severity . thus, patients whose severity score is inconsistent with the blue module eigengene expression are unlikely to be related to the associated disease pathway. we "homogenized" the female data set by restricting the analysis to samples with either a) moderate to high severity  that also had a high blue module eigengene value meblue > mean or b) less severe samples  with meblue < mean. homogenization excluded  <dig> samples, resulting in  <dig> homogenized female  samples. as expected, homogenization increased the mean module significance from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . since homogenization amounts to sample selection, the resulting p-values are biased and should be interpreted as descriptive rather than inferential measures. homogenization can be used to reduce the genetic heterogeneity inherent in complex trait studies.

identifying a relevant snp marker
the genetic marker data consisted of  <dig> autosomal snps located near or within a set of eight genes that were considered biologically relevant for cfs   <cit> . we chose to focus on snp rs <dig> located within the tph <dig> tryptophan hydroxylase  <dig> gene because it had previously been shown to be associated with chronic fatigue, and it was associated with cfs severity in our data set  <cit> . table  <dig> reports the average severity correlations for each of the eight genes and its most correlated snp. the tph <dig> snp was associated with severity  and moderately associated with the blue module gene expressions . the tph <dig> gene functions in serotonin synthesis which is part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  feedback system that has been consistently implicated in cfs  <cit> .

tph <dig> with seven snps had the highest average association with cfs severity.

the severity, meblue, tph <dig> snp, and foxn <dig> correlations  and p-values  for five different subsets of the first primary data set and the homogenized samples in the secondary data set. severity is most significantly related tomeblue, the tph <dig> snp and the candidate foxn <dig> gene in the combined male and homogenized female sub set. homogenizing the second data set  also improved the meblue and foxn <dig> associations with severity.

1meblue refers to the blue module eigengene, or first principal component of the blue module.

systems genetic screening criteria
because the connectivity kmeblue can be interpreted as a measure of membership to the blue module, it can be used to prioritize pathway defining genes. we selected candidate genes that met the following criteria in both males and homogenized female samples: i) gstph <dig> greater than  <dig>  to select genes that were associated with a cfs-related snp, ii) kmeblue in the top 80% to select genes that were centrally located within the blue module, and iii) gsseverity and gstph <dig> signs that were consistent in both sexes. the purpose of this last criterion was to safeguard against potentially spurious correlations. we reasoned that genes which are positively correlated with severity in one sex but are negatively correlated in the other are less credible than those with strong correlations in the same direction among both sexes. iv) we also required a moderate correlation of  <dig>  with the severity trait  in males and a slightly stronger correlation of  <dig>  in the homogenized females . out of the  <dig> network genes, twenty met these four criteria: c3orf <dig>  cd <dig>  crnkl <dig>  dctn <dig>  foxn <dig>  ltv <dig>  med <dig>  npal <dig>  pbld, pgk <dig>  ppp1r14c, prdx <dig>  prkch, ryk, snurf, sucla <dig>  tfb2m, tmem50a, vamp <dig> and xm <dig>  annotation and correlation information are provided in additional file  <dig> and table  <dig>  respectively. we found that selection of the foxn <dig> gene was relatively robust with respect to the choice of screening criteria as long as association with the tph <dig> snp was imposed in both sexes.

 the correlations were computed using all  <dig> samples studied , the  <dig> female samples and the  <dig> male samples except for the correlation with severity which only had  <dig> non-missing scores . the cfs severity column is bolded for clarity.

when we applied these screening criteria to the  <dig> most varying genes,  <dig> met these criteria and the gene names and correlation measures are provided . note that all of the  <dig> candidate genes are included in this list.

investigating causal relationships
our next step was to orient relationships between the candidate genes and the severity-related module. toward this end, we used the trait-related tph <dig> snp as a causal anchor in the network edge orienting  software  <cit> . we defined a gene as being causal for the module if the leo.nb.singlemarker score for the causal model was positive and at least twice as probable as the maximum alternative model's score, i.e. we required a minimum leo.nb.singlemarker score of  <dig>  ≈ log <dig>  while a threshold of log <dig> =  <dig> was recommended by  <cit> , we relaxed it here due to our small sample size .

the leo.nb.singlemarker scores for the  <dig> candidate genes are provided in additional file  <dig>  there were  <dig> causal genes out of  <dig> blue module genes. all but three of our  <dig> candidate genes were causal for the blue module, with an average causality score rank of  <dig>  a neo analysis of the male and homogenized female data subset  indicated that all but two of the  <dig> candidate genes were causal, with an average causality rank of  <dig> . these results indicate that our 5-step strategy identifies a trait-related module and its potential causal drivers.

applying our gene screening strategy to a second data set
we applied our gene screening strategy to the  <dig> patient samples that were missing severity scores but had a similar measure of cfs severity called "empiric severity". the rationale was that replicating the candidate gene findings in these samples would support the iwgcna results. we first checked that the module definitions from the first data set were preserved in the second data set. figure  <dig> shows that the blue module was well preserved and figure  <dig> shows that the corresponding module membership measures kmeblue were preserved as well. applying the same integrated gene screening criteria as described above resulted in  <dig> candidate genes, six of which had been identified in the primary data set: foxn <dig>  dctn <dig>  ppp1r14c, vamp <dig>  tfb2m and xm <dig> 

pathway annotation of candidate genes
additional file  <dig> includes pathway annotations for the  <dig> candidate genes that were eligible for annotation with ingenuity® systems' pathways analysis  software. column  gives results for an ipa analysis of the candidate genes, and  shows their corresponding annotations when the  <dig> blue module genes were analyzed . out of the  <dig> candidate genes, ipa identified a highly significant pathway  containing  <dig> of them foxn <dig>  prdx <dig>  sucla <dig>  tfb2m, med <dig>  snurf, dctn <dig>  pgk <dig>  prkch, ryk, vamp <dig> and pbld, and this pathway most likely functioned in cell cycle, cancer, cell death, and hematological disease . column  shows that the  <dig> blue module analysis suggested functionally relevant pathways for the candidate genes such as i) endocrine system disorders, infectious disease, and inflammatory disease; ii) connective tissue development and function and iii) viral function. pathways i-iii and hematological disease are consistent with results from previous cfs research  <cit> .

we investigated the tph <dig> snp's contribution to our gene screening strategy by repeating the candidate gene ipa with tph <dig> included. indeed, ipa positioned tph <dig> within the top hematological disease pathway containing  <dig> candidate genes. this finding supports the notion that snp-associated gene expression profiles are likely to interact with the snp-containing gene.

to determine known interactions between the candidate genes within the blue module, we carried out an ipa comparison between the candidate gene and blue module gene networks. figure  <dig> shows that the main hematological disease pathway in the candidate gene ipa is directly connected to seven pathways within the blue module network . this illustrates the value of iwgcna: it identifies a candidate gene pathway that is centrally located within the blue module network, i.e. it identifies genes influencing multiple biological pathways.

functional annotation of candidate genes
the iwgcna of a cfs data set identifies candidate genes that interact in biologically relevant immune and connective tissue pathways. in this section, we show that in addition to belonging to relevant pathways, our candidate genes have functions that are consistent with findings from other cfs studies. here we focus on foxn <dig>  prdx <dig>  and sucla <dig>  but other interesting candidates are described in additional file  <dig>  foxn <dig> is highly expressed in thymus epithelia cells. the thymus gland plays a pivotal role in the immune system by converting lymphocytes to t-cells and releasing functional t-cells to combat infection. a foxn <dig> knockout mouse model has been shown to have a deficient immune system due to a lack of functional t-cells  <cit> . similarly, humans with mutations in foxn <dig> have an immune system deficiency  <cit> . under the assumption that a compromised immune system can cause chronic fatigue, this knockout mouse suggests a potential role for foxn <dig> in chronic fatigue. because of its statistical significance and biological importance, foxn <dig> is a candidate for investigating the immune system's role in cfs severity.

prdx <dig> is a clinically interesting candidate because of its role in mitochondrial function and apoptosis. specifically, it regulates the abundance of h2o <dig> and other reactive oxygen compounds that mediate apoptosis  <cit> . sucla <dig> is another gene involved in mitochondrial function that could be clinically relevant for chronic fatigue. mutations in sucla <dig> have previously been associated with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, a disorder which causes fatigue and muscle weakness  <cit> . these immune, cell death, and muscular system functions are consistent with findings from other cfs studies  <cit> .

a standard analysis of chronic fatigue syndrome that excludes the tph <dig> snp marker and module membership
iwgcna requires at least one reliable snp marker that is associated with the disease. while the relationship between cfs and the tph <dig> snp has been reported in a previous study, the relatively unimpressive p-value suggests that additional data are needed to confirm its validity. here we present results from a standard analysis of the chronic fatigue data that excludes the snp and module membership information.

starting with the  <dig> most varying genes, we computed the p-values for the pearson correlation test of the gene expression profiles with the severity trait. for each p-value, we computed the corresponding local false discovery rate  using the qvalue package in r  <cit> . we used ingenuity pathways analysis software to study pathways and functions of the  <dig> genes that achieved the minimum false discovery rate of  <dig> . among the  <dig> genes that were eligible for ingenuity network construction, the top pathways were: 1) viral function, molecular transport, rna trafficking ; 2) connective tissue development and function, cell signaling, molecular transport ; and 3) cell morphology, cellular assembly and organization, cancer . as the viral function pathway achieves the highest score and is clinically relevant to cfs, we consider these  <dig> genes as top candidates of the standard analysis. table  <dig> gives the gene names and functional summaries for these genes. the leo.nb.singlemarker scores were excluded as only af <dig> with a score of  <dig>  exceeded our causality threshold. we also present the correlations between these  <dig> genes and cfs severity, meblue, and the tph <dig> snp in table  <dig>  figure  <dig> indicates that the standard analysis genes tend to have higher correlations with severity than the iwgcna genes. also as expected, these genes tend to have lower correlations with meblue and the tph <dig> snp than the iwgcna genes.

the correlations were computed using the  <dig> samples studied , the  <dig> female samples and the  <dig> male samples except for the correlation with severity which only had  <dig> non-missing scores . four of the candidate genes indicated in bold satisfied our iwgcna screening criteria . the cfs severity column is bolded forclarity.

2the median was computed using the absolute value.

recall that an ingenuity pathways analysis  of the  <dig> iwgcna candidate genes and the tph <dig> gene produced a top ipa network that included the tph <dig> gene. for comparison we repeated this analysis using the  <dig> standard analysis genes and tph <dig>  neither of the two resulting ipa networks contained the tph <dig> gene, which is consistent with the low correlations observed between the tph <dig> snp and these genes. while both the standard analysis and iwgcna identified viral function and connective tissue genes, there was no overlap between the top  <dig> iwgcna and the top  <dig> standard analysis candidate genes. this result is not surprising since different methods were used to reduce the  <dig> gene set to about  <dig> % of its original size . to provide a more comprehensive comparison, we applied the iwgcna screening criteria to the  <dig> gene set which resulted in  <dig> genes, including the top  <dig> iwgcna genes . four of the standard analysis genes were on this 89-gene list: pdpk <dig>  zmynd <dig>  dmbt <dig> and eif2c <dig> . furthermore, nine of the standard analysis genes could be considered as part of the blue module since their module membership values were higher than the minimum kmeblue =  <dig>  of the  <dig> module genes.

discussion
we present a systems genetic screening method for identifying candidate complex disease genes when gene expression, genetic marker and clinical outcome data are available. we demonstrate iwgcna in a set of patients who had been diagnosed with some fatigue symptoms according to the  <dig> cfs case definition criteria. the iwgcna identifies a cfs severity-related module consisting of  <dig> genes and a subset of  <dig> candidate genes within this module that hold particular promise for future cfs studies. in addition to belonging to a severity-related module the  <dig> iwgcna candidate genes also a) had a high association with the tph <dig> locus, b) high intramodular connectivity, and c) were related to cfs severity in both sexes. genetic marker based causality analysis indicated that  <dig> of the  <dig> candidate genes were causal for their parent module . furthermore, we found that the blue module and intramodular gene connectivities were highly preserved in a second set of samples that had a similar empiric diagnosis of cfs severity. applying iwgcna in this data set replicated six of our  <dig> candidate genes. pathway annotation with ipa software showed that our candidate gene results agreed with previously published findings that cfs affects the endocrine, immune and connective tissue systems  <cit> .

a standard gene-screening strategy based on the local false discovery rate  and ipa software suggested  <dig> genes that functioned in a viral pathway. relative to the standard analysis candidates, the  <dig> iwgcna genes had a moderate association with severity, and stronger associations with the tph <dig> snp and meblue. ipa results showed that using a snp marker to screen for candidate gene expressions can identify genes that are known to interact with the snp-containing gene.

although the candidate gene findings from the iwgcna and standard analysis are compelling, our purpose here is to illustrate a novel systems genetic gene-screening method. while it is reassuring that ipa software suggested viral and connective tissue function for both the iwgcna and standard analysis candidates, there was no overlap between the corresponding top  <dig> and top  <dig> candidate gene lists. a more comprehensive comparison revealed that four genes  were implicated by both analyses. furthermore, although the reported p-values and causality scores are useful for exploring relative gene significance, the actual values did not reach genome-wide significance. although this is to be expected for a complex disease study of modest magnitude , it emphasizes a conservative interpretation of these results. finally, the patient sample may not be representative of the typical cfs patient population, as these patients were physically able to attend clinic . we should also point out that the candidate genes relate to cfs severity among patients with some fatigue symptoms, so these genes may not distinguish cfs patients from healthy controls. in order to make a clinical contribution to cfs etiology, our candidate gene findings require validation in additional studies. the purpose of this article is to illustrate a systems genetic gene screening strategy that yields testable hypotheses for future investigations. iwgcna is a step towards the development and application of systems genetic approaches to complex disease gene mapping.

CONCLUSIONS
integrating gene co-expression networks with allelic association studies holds great promise for elucidating the genetic basis of complex diseases. we describe an intuitive and simple five-step incarnation of such an approach  and apply it to a chronic fatigue syndrome data set. our complete r statistical software code is available at .
