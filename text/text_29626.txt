BACKGROUND
nuclear receptor nur <dig>  also known as nr4a <dig>  tr <dig> or ngfi-b, is a member of the nr4a receptor subfamily that also comprises nurr <dig>  and nor- <dig> . like other nuclear receptors, the nr4as consist of an n-terminal transactivation domain, a central zinc finger dna binding domain  and a c-terminal ligand binding domain. structural analyses revealed that the nr4a receptors lack a classical hydrophobic ligand-binding pocket as a result of hydrophobic residues of amino-acid side chains, and so far no ligands have been identified  <cit> . nur <dig> is therefore referred to as an orphan nuclear receptor and its activity is regulated through gene expression, posttranslational modifications and coregulator interactions, as recently reviewed  <cit> . nur <dig> is a typical early response gene and its induction can be achieved with a plethora of stimuli among which peptide hormones, mitogens, physical stimulation and inflammatory factors. known transcription factors inducing its expression include cyclic adenosine monophosphate  responsive element binding protein , activator protein  <dig> , nfκb, and myocyte enhancer factor  <dig> . nur <dig> can bind as a monomer to the so-called ngfi-b response element  in the promoter region of direct target genes. nur <dig> and nurr <dig> can also form homodimers and heterodimers with retinoid x receptor and bind a dr- <dig> response element  <cit> . furthermore, gene transcription is modulated by nur <dig> itself through transrepression of other transcription factors. for example, nur <dig> exhibits a direct, inhibitory interaction with the p <dig> subunit of nfκb  <cit> .

in macrophages, nur <dig> is expressed in response to proinflammatory stimuli like prostaglandins, tumor necrosis factor-α , lipopolysaccharide , interferon gamma  and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor   <cit> . there may exist some discrepancy regarding nur77’s anti-inflammatory role in macrophage function . to elucidate the role of nur <dig> in macrophages in more detail, we cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages  from wild-type  and nur77-deficient  mice, stimulated the cells with lps and employed, to our knowledge for the first time, a gene expression study in these cells. our data support functional involvement of nur <dig> in  macrophage physiology, by revealing the inhibition of stromal-derived factor -1α expression, regulation of rac1-mediated phagocytosis, extracellular matrix homeostasis and tolerance.

RESULTS
expression profiling reveals that nur <dig> modulates inflammatory gene expression in macrophages
to understand the function of nur <dig> in macrophages, rna was isolated from bmm isolates derived from nur77-ko and wt mice and transcriptionally profiled. in these cells  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in nur77-ko compared with wt bmm , of which 64 % were upregulated and 36 % were downregulated in nur77-ko compared with wt bmm. the top  <dig> up- and downregulated genes are shown in fig. 1a and listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  these data were verified by qrt-pcr  for s <dig> calcium binding protein a <dig> , neuropeptide y  and serine  peptidase inhibitor g <dig>  showing higher expression in nur77-ko bmm and for fbj osteosarcoma oncogene  showing decreased expression. we performed ingenuity pathway downstream effects analysis to visualize the effect of nur <dig> deficiency on biological processes and disease. our microarray data imply enhanced inflammation in nur77-ko bmm as inflammatory response, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, hematological system development, cellular movement and immune cell trafficking are predicted to be activated in these cells compared to wt bmm .fig.  <dig> nur <dig> modulates inflammatory gene expression in macrophages. a heatmap of the top  <dig> up- and downregulated genes in nur77-ko compared with wt bmm. the changes in mrna abundance in nur77-ko compared to wt bmm were determined by microarray analysis. the color-coded scale  for the log2-transformed expression values, normalized per gene, is indicated at the right of the figure. b increased and decreased biological functions in nu77-ko compared to wt bmm identified by ipa downstream effects analysis. the color-coded scale at the left of the figure reflects the direction of change for the function, based on the regulation z-score . the size of the box reflects the p-values 



in bmm nur <dig> reduces sdf-1α promoter activity
previously, we have shown that sdf-1α, also known as cxcl <dig>  mrna expression is increased in nur77-ko bmm, independent of stimulation and that overexpression of nur <dig> in nur77-ko bmm normalized sdf-1α expression  <cit> . in the current study, sdf-1α was also present in the top  <dig> of upregulated genes in nur77-deficient bmm .

nur77-ko bmm have been shown to exhibit a proinflammatory phenotype after lps activation involving enhanced expression of multiple cytokines  <cit> . for many cytokines the enhanced expression in the absence of nur <dig> may be explained by the transrepressive interaction between nur <dig> and p <dig> nfκb  <cit> . induction of sdf-1α expression, however, involves activation of the non-canonical p <dig> nfκb pathway  <cit> . in order to establish the mechanism by which nur <dig> represses sdf-1α, we investigated p <dig> activity, which turned out to be similar in wt and nur77-ko bmm upon lps or cd <dig> activation. these data indicate that the difference in sdf-1α expression due to nur <dig> deficiency cannot be explained by changes in the p <dig> nfκb signaling pathway . subsequently, we analyzed the sequence of the sdf-1α promoter and found one potential nbre consensus sequence at position -160 bp in the sdf-1α promoter region: ‘aaaggtct’ in which the last a residue of the consensus sequence is missing . two promoter reporter constructs comprising bp − <dig> to + <dig> and bp − <dig> to + <dig> were placed in luciferase reporter plasmids and were tested for activity. the shorter fragment drives higher basal luciferase expression than the longer construct, which may be caused by inhibitory elements in the bp − <dig> to − <dig> region of the promoter. overexpression of nur <dig> resulted in strong inhibition of both reporters. furthermore, mutation of the potential nbre  reduced this inhibitory activity of nur <dig> 4– <dig> fold . these data are in line with the data obtained from chip experiments revealing that nur <dig> interacts with this sdf-1α promoter region .fig.  <dig> nur <dig> represses sdf-1α expression through binding to an nbre in the sdf-1α promoter. a the activation of the non-canonical nfκb pathway was measured in nur77-ko and wt bmm by determining active p <dig> levels in the presence of lps or cd <dig> activating antibody. b analysis of the sdf-1α promoter region revealed the presence of an nbre. mutation analysis showed involvement of this nbre in nur77-dependent repression of sdf1α expression as measured by luciferase activity. data were normalized for transfection efficiency by corresponding renilla luciferase activity and in the right panel are depicted relative to the luciferase activity in the absence of nur <dig>  dnbre, mutation of nbre. c nur <dig> binding to the sdf-1α promoter was determined by chip analyses using sdf-1α promoter-specific primers and nur77-specific antibodies  or control igg in bmm after lentiviral overexpression of nur <dig>  data are representative of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate. values represent mean ± s.d. *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> 



nur <dig> enhances expression of cx3cr <dig> in bmm
one of the most strongly downregulated genes in nur77-ko bmm was cx3cr <dig>  which is the receptor for the cytokine cx3cl <dig>  also known as fractalkine. cx3cr <dig> is expressed on a subset of monocytes that in mice are typically ly6clo. these monocytes are known as patrolling monocytes with a crucial function in endothelial cell maintenance and are lacking in nur77-ko mice  <cit> . qpcr confirmed decreased cx3cr <dig> mrna expression in nur77-ko bmm compared to wt cells . in line with this observation, nur <dig> knockdown in wt bmm showed diminished cx3cr <dig> expression compared to shcon treated cells , whereas nur <dig> overexpression in raw cells resulted in increased cx3cr <dig> expression . moreover, cx3cr <dig> protein expression was attenuated in nur77-ko bmm compared to wt bmm . cx3cr <dig> deficiency in mice results in a decrease of lamina propria macrophages and increased severity of experimental colitis  <cit> . since macrophage cx3cr <dig> plays such an important role in gut tolerance, we also determined its mrna expression in mouse colon  and observed a modest but significant reduction of cx3cr <dig> expression in nur77-ko colon lysates, which may indicate a decreased macrophage tolerance possibly making nur77-ko mice more prone to develop colitis. we have recently investigated the function of nur <dig> in inflammatory bowel disease and have shown that deficiency of nur <dig> indeed aggravates both dss- and tnbs-induced colitis  <cit> .fig.  <dig> cx3cr <dig> is downregulated in nur77-ko bmm and its expression is reduced in colons of nur77-ko mice. mrna expression of cx3cr <dig> was determined by qrt-pcr after treatment with 100 ng/ml lps for the indicated time points in  wt and nur77-ko bmm and in wt bmm transduced with control  or nur <dig>  shrna and  in raw cells transfected with control  or nur77-encoding plasmids. c cx3cr <dig> protein expression in wt and nur77-ko bmm after stimulation with 100 ng/ml lps for 0 h  or 24 h. protein expression was normalized to β-actin expression for quantification. d mrna expression of cx3cr <dig> in colons of wt and nur77-ko mice was determined by qrt-pcr. data are expressed as mean ± s.d. *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> 



modulation of extracellular matrix production in bmm by nur77
to obtain a better understanding of the functional differences between wt and nur77-ko macrophages, we performed ingenuity pathway analyses  to identify canonical pathways with a statistically significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes. the top  <dig> canonical pathways discriminating wt from nur77-ko bmm are shown in fig. 4a and details on the genes regulated in those pathways are presented in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the top ranking canonical pathway is ‘inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases’ , which comprises  <dig> genes,  <dig> of which show changed expression in nur77-ko bmm compared with wt cells. interestingly,  <dig> of the top  <dig> canonical pathways involve regulation of mmps, their inhibitors the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases  and/or collagens . additionally, gene set enrichment analysis  was performed to identify biocarta, kegg, pid or reactome pathways that are regulated in nur77-ko bmm compared to wt cells. of the top  <dig> enriched gene sets,  <dig> are related to extracellular matrix interactions , involving collagens. subsequently, the expression of all genes encoding proteins belonging to mmp, timp or collagen families was summarized in a volcano plot , revealing that mmp <dig> expression was reduced in nur77-ko bmm , whereas the expression of mmp <dig> , mmp <dig> , mmp <dig> , mmp <dig> , timp <dig>  and timp <dig>  was increased or showing a trend towards increased expression. mmps and timps are crucial regulators of extracellular matrix composition and macrophages have been shown to produce collagens . the expression of several collagen subtypes  was significantly increased in nur77-deficient bmm. total mmp activity in protein lysates from nur77-ko and wt bmm was determined by zymography, and as shown in fig. 4c, both under control conditions as well as after lps stimulation, especially mmp <dig> , was significantly lower in nur77-ko bmm compared to wt cells. the balance between mmp- and timp activity and collagen synthesis eventually determines the net collagen content of the extracellular matrix. because each of these aspects was changed in nur77-ko bmm, the collagen content of bmm was subsequently measured and was significantly higher in nur77-ko bmm both before and after lps stimulation  compared to wt bmm. these data clearly reveal involvement of nur <dig> in extracellular matrix composition, unexpectedly indicating that nur <dig> reduces collagen content of bmm matrix.fig.  <dig> nur <dig> deficiency results in decreased mmp activity and enhanced collagen content. a the top  <dig> canonical pathways associated with differentially expressed genes comparing nur77-ko with wt bmms were identified by ipa. the line graph represents the ratio of differentially expressed genes from the dataset to the genes present in each canonical pathway. the pathways are ranked from highest to lowest degree of association between genes from the data set with the pathways by the p-value, calculated by a right tailed fisher exact test. the bar graph represents the -log and the threshold represents p =  <dig> . b the -log <dig> p-values of the mmps , timps  and collagens  were plotted against their corresponding log <dig> fold changes  in unstimulated  and lps stimulated  bmm. c mmp activity in bmm lysates derived from wt and nur77-ko mice was determined by zymography and mmp <dig> activity was quantified . c, control; lps, 24 h stimulation with 100 ng/ml lps. d collagen content measured in wt and nur77-ko bmm stimulated for 24 h with 100 ng/ml lps. *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> 



disease pathways
to link gene sets that are upregulated in nur77-ko bmm compared to wt cells with human disease pathways, we performed gsea . several of these diseases are already known to be associated with nur <dig>  namely vascular disease , cancer , metabolism  and kidney ischemia reperfusion injury . westbrook et al.  <cit>  have shown that nur77-deficient rats on a kidney injury-susceptible genetic background exhibited decreased renal function and attenuated kidney injury, which was rescued by bone marrow transplanted from control animals, suggesting a strong immune cell or even macrophage mediation. furthermore, proteinuria was reported in nur77-ko rats, which correlates with the current gsea analysis predicting proteinuria. however, we did not find a difference in urine total protein or albumin levels between healthy wt and nur77-ko mice, which of course may be different in kidney disease models . in addition, our gsea indicated that nur <dig> may functionally be involved in systemic scleroderma; this is characterized by thickening of the skin caused by accumulation of collagen. palumbo-zerr et al. have recently shown that loss of nur <dig> exacerbates fibrosis in multiple models of skin fibrosis  <cit> , which is in line with the increased collagen production we observed in nur77-ko bmm. gsea indicated that nur <dig> may also functionally be involved with macular degeneration, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and osteoarthritis. the latter corresponds with the ipa revealing several rheumatoid arthritis signaling pathways to be effected .table  <dig> top  <dig> human disease pathway gene sets identified with gsea that are upregulated in nur77-ko vs wt bmm

upstream regulators
ipa upstream regulator analysis was used to identify proteins that may be responsible for gene expression changes observed in our dataset. ipa predicts which upstream regulators are activated or inhibited to explain the upregulated and downregulated genes observed in the dataset. knowledge of this regulatory cascade may indicate novel pathways that elucidate  the observed gene expression changes in our dataset. ipa upstream regulator analysis identified  <dig> upstream regulators that are activated in nur77-ko bmm and nine inhibited factors, among which nur <dig> . six of the upstream regulators, besides nur <dig> itself, have been described to interact with nur77; nor <dig>  smarca <dig>  smarca <dig>  tp <dig>  hif-1α, and β-catenin , resulting in altered signaling  <cit>  . in addition to transcription factors, also kinases and enzymes are among the predicted upstream regulators. our analysis revealed rac <dig> as an activated upstream regulator possibly regulating nur77-mediated changes in gene expression. we therefore measured the levels of active rac <dig> in nur77-ko and wt bmm and observed that only nur77-ko bmm contain active rac <dig>  which is completely inhibited by rac <dig> inhibitor, whereas wt bmm show no basal rac <dig> activity , indicating that nur <dig> is involved in a negative feedback loop with rac <dig>  since rac <dig> is highly involved in cell motility and cytoskeleton movements in phagocytosis , we subsequently tested the fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis capacity of nur77-ko and wt bmm. as is shown in fig. 5c, the phagocytosis index of nur77-ko bmm regarding uropathogenic e. coli was almost 2-fold higher compared to wt cells. in addition to being involved in phagocytosis, rac <dig> is known to inhibit mmp <dig> expression  <cit>  correlating with our findings that mmp <dig> activity is lower in nur77-ko bmm .fig.  <dig> rac <dig> is an upstream regulator activated in nur77-ko bmm resulting in enhanced phagocytosis in these cells. a upstream regulators in nur77-ko compared to wt bmm identified by ipa upstream regulator analysis. the bias-corrected z-score and the p-value were calculated as described in additional file 1: table s <dig>  b active rac <dig> levels were determined in the presence and absence of the rac <dig> inhibitor  <dig>  c phagocytosis of fitc-labeled uropathogenic e. coli bacteria by wt and nur77-ko bmm was measured by flow cytometry and the phagocytosis index was calculated as the percentage of cells with internalized bacteria times the mean fluorescence intensity. data are expressed as mean ± s.d. ns, not significant, ***p <  <dig> 



discussion
in the current study we performed a transcriptome analysis to explore the function of nur <dig> in macrophage function in addition to its known role in modulation of inflammatory responses  <cit> . the obtained data uncovered involvement of nur <dig> in extracellular matrix modulation, macrophage tolerance and inhibition of phagocytosis  and insight in its potential function in several diseases.fig.  <dig> role of nur <dig> in macrophages. nur <dig> modulates the inflammatory state of macrophages through multiple mechanisms, decreases collagen production by lowering timp1- <dig> and collagen mrna expression, and lowers rac <dig> activity resulting in decreased phagocytosis capacity. green indicates a protective effect and red depicts a negative effect of nur <dig> expression



in line with our previous observations, cxcl12/sdf-1α expression was higher in nur77-ko bmm than in wt cells. even though nur <dig> transrepresses nfκb p <dig>  nur <dig> did not affect nfκb p <dig> activity. rather, direct binding of nur <dig> to the sdf-1α promoter was shown to be crucial to inhibit expression of this gene. it was unexpected to detect diminished mmp <dig> activity, increased timp1- <dig> gene expression and enhanced expression of several collagen subtypes, among which col1a <dig>  present in the list of top- <dig> regulated genes, col6a <dig> and col12a <dig>  of note, wang et al.  <cit>  recently demonstrated that nur <dig> augments mmp <dig> expression in colorectal cancer cells promoting invasion and metastasis of colorectal cancer. corresponding with these observations, nur77-ko bmm were shown to synthesize more collagen in their subcellular matrix compared to wt macrophages. this aspect of macrophages is relevant to wound healing, however, wound closure is normal in nur77-ko mice  <cit> . wound healing is a complex process involving multiple cell types, which may explain why overexpression of a dominant-negative variant of nur <dig> in endothelial cells disturbs normal wound healing. in a similar way, nur <dig> may need to be studied in more detail in macrophages during wound healing.

the most strongly downregulated gene in the absence of nur <dig> was cx3cr <dig>  which is especially expressed on colon lamina propria macrophages that sample antigen from the intestinal lumen  <cit> . cx3cr1high macrophages produce il- <dig>  contributing to the maintenance and local expansion of protective regulatory t cells in the gut  <cit> . cx3cr <dig> expression was not only decreased in nur77-ko bmm, but also in colon samples of these mice compared to wt colon. previously, we have shown that il- <dig> production by nur77-ko bmm is lower compared to wt bmm  <cit> . together, these data indicate a role for nur <dig> in macrophage tolerance towards host bacteria in the gut and recently we have shown that dysregulation of nur <dig> expression indeed leads to enhanced development of inflammatory bowel disease  <cit> . in the ipa upstream regulator analysis, we found the small gtpase rac <dig> as an intriguing, unknown regulator of nur77-mediated gene expression, which by itself is regulated by nur77-deficiency. rac <dig> is critically involved in cytoskeletal rearrangements  <cit>  and thus important in cell motility. in macrophages, it predominantly regulates fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis  <cit> , cell fusion  <cit>  and migration  <cit> . we found increased rac <dig> activity upon nur <dig> deficiency in bmm and a drastic increase in phagocytic capacity of nur77-ko bmm in an e.coli opsonization model. these data strongly support our previous finding that nur77-ko mice show a better initial clearance of bacteria during e.coli-induced peritonitis  <cit> . the latter study showed that the responsiveness of peritoneal macrophages to e. coli was only mildly affected by nur77-deficiency, which is in line with our microarray data that reveal a limited effect of nur77-deficiency on lps-induced changes in gene expression .

our unbiased analyses of signaling pathways and diseases resulted in multiple hits relating to vascular disease and atherosclerosis. more specifically, gene sets identified with gsea are; ‘signaling by pdgf, smooth muscle cell contractions, sphingolipid metabolism and cxcr <dig> pathway’  . in addition, gsea revealed ‘carotid artery diseases’ and ‘coronary disease’ in the top  <dig> of human disease pathways, whereas ‘atherosclerosis signaling’ was found in ipa amongst the top  <dig> of canonical pathways associated with differentially expressed genes in nur77-ko versus wt bmm . altogether, the analyses on bmm gene expression support the protective function of nur <dig> in atherosclerosis  <cit> . the other two members of the same subfamily of nuclear hormone receptors, nurr <dig> and nor- <dig>  are also expressed in human atherosclerotic lesion macrophages and were shown to repress lps-induced inflammatory response in thp- <dig> macrophages  <cit> . similarly as nur <dig>  transplantation of bone marrow deficient for nor- <dig> into atherosclerotic mice, aggravates the formation of atherosclerotic lesions  <cit> .

even though our gene expression analyses were performed in macrophages, a potential involvement of nur <dig> in ‘diabetic nephropathy, angiopathy and retinopathy and glucose intolerance’ was predicted from gsea , which may emphasize the relative importance of macrophages in these pathologies. macrophages are indeed known to contribute to the nephropathies , angiopathies  <cit>  and retinopathy  <cit>  seen in diabetes. nur <dig> regulates hepatic glucose homeostasis  <cit>  and nur77-deficiency causes increased diet-induced insulin resistance  <cit> . regarding the recent observation that lipid storage by adipose tissue macrophages regulates systemic glucose tolerance  <cit> , it may be interesting to investigate glucose tolerance after a nur77-deficient bone marrow transplantation into ob/ob mice.

finally, we found multiple, often chronic inflammatory diseases to be potentially influenced by macrophage nur <dig> expression. in most of these diseases macrophages are known to play a role. gsea  revealed osteoarthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and macular degeneration, whereas ipa  associated nur <dig> to rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and allergic airway inflammatory diseases. interestingly, recently kurakula et al.  <cit>  showed a protective role for nur <dig> in ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation. nur <dig> expression is elevated in synovial tissue, cartilage and prostaglandin e <dig>  stimulated chondrocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis or osteoarthritis, making nur <dig> an attractive target in rheumatic diseases . in addition, t cell-specific nur <dig> overexpression results in reduction of incidence and severity of collagen-induced arthritis by promoting activation-induced t cell apoptosis and inhibition of collagenii-specific antibody production  <cit> . interestingly, nurr <dig> has already been shown to modulate psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> . the observed associations reveal potential, and so far speculative, connections between nur <dig> and rheumatoid arthritis, macular degeneration, psoriasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and we therefore propose that it may be relevant to study the role of nur <dig> in these diseases.

CONCLUSIONS
our transcriptome analysis to explore the role of nur <dig> in macrophage function uncovered involvement of nur <dig> in extracellular matrix modulation, macrophage tolerance and inhibition of phagocytosis and insight in its potential function in several diseases. in summary, as schematically shown in fig.  <dig>  nur <dig> modulates the inflammatory state of macrophages by decreasing inflammatory gene expression in macrophages via nfκb transrepression and positively regulating cx3cr <dig> expression. nur <dig> directly represses sdf-1α secretion, which may result in less chemo-attraction of inflammatory cells. in addition, nur <dig> inhibits the collagen content of the extracellular matrix of macrophages, diminishes rac <dig> activity and reduces phagocytosis of these cells. all these effects can influence a plethora of inflammatory and metabolic diseases, making nur <dig> an interesting factor to study and maybe even to target in treatment of chronic inflammatory disease.
