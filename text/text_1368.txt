BACKGROUND
the eight recognized species within the genus listeria include l. monocytogenes, l. innocua, l. welshimeri, l. seeligeri, l. ivanovii, l. grayi, l. marthii  <cit>  and l. rocourtiae  <cit> , the latter two were described in  <dig>  l. grayi is only distantly related to the other listeria species  <cit>  and has been proposed to represent a different genus, murraya  <cit> . l. monocytogenes and l. ivanovii are pathogens of warm-blooded hosts. l monocytogenes causes a severe foodborne disease in humans as well as invasive infections in a number of other warm-blooded host species, particularly ruminants. l. ivanovii predominantly causes infections in ruminants, but has also been associated with rare infections in humans  <cit> ; this species is considered to have a narrower host range than l. monocytogenes  <cit> . interestingly, each of these two pathogenic listeria species is closely related to non-pathogenic species; l. monocytogenes is closely related to l. innocua and l. marthii  <cit> , and l. ivanovii is closely related to l. seeligeri  <cit> , which is non-pathogenic even though many isolates contain a homologue of the main listeria virulence gene cluster.

genome sequencing efforts for listeria have, so far, largely focused on l. monocytogenes; as of august  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> l. monocytogenes genome sequences are publicly accessible in standard sequence databases . most of these l. monocytogenes genome sequences represent strains classified into the two most common l. monocytogenes phylogenetic lineages  <cit>  including lineage i  and lineage ii . the other two l. monocytogenes phylogenetic lineages  are only represented by  <dig> genome sequences . publicly available genome sequences for other listeria species include those for l. innocua clip <dig>  <cit>  and l. welshimeri slcc <dig>  <cit>  as well as recently released the genome sequences for l. seeligeri slcc <dig>  <cit>  and l. grayii dsm  <dig> . knowledge of the genomic content of non-pathogenic relatives of pathogenic species is necessary though to understand the evolution of virulence associated genes and to facilitate identification of putative virulence genes  <cit> .

the main listeria virulence gene cluster  encodes a number of proteins that are necessary for intracellular survival and motility  <cit> . specific functions encoded in this cluster include hemolysin, two phospholipases and a metalloprotease , which all contribute to escape from host cell vacuoles, an actin polymerizing protein , and a global regulator of virulence gene transcription . members of the internalin protein family, which are cell wall anchored or secreted proteins that are characterized by the presence of leucine rich repeats, are also associated with virulence in different listeria strains. while a considerable number of genes encoding internalins have been reported in pathogenic and non-pathogenic listeria  <cit> , clear virulence related functions have only been assigned to a few internalins, including inla and inlb, which encode proteins required for invasion of different cells types, including human intestinal epithelial cells  <cit> , and inlc  <cit> . a number of atypical listeria strains and lineages have been reported  <cit> , including several putative evolutionary intermediates, which are characterized by unique virulence gene presence/absence patterns. for example, while the non-pathogenic l. innocua is typically non-hemolytic and lacks the prfa cluster, a small number of strains that contain the prfa cluster as well as inla have been reported  <cit> . also, non-hemolytic l. seeligeri strains that lack the prfa cluster have been reported  <cit> ; even though many l. seeligeri contain the prfa cluster, isolates in this species are avirulent in typically studied mammalian hosts  <cit> .

based on the observations outlined above, we propose that the genus listeria represents an outstanding model system for studying the evolution of pathogenicity and the transition between pathogenic and saprotrophic lifestyles using a comparative genomics approach. we thus performed genome sequencing of  isolates representing listeria species  for which no genome sequences are publicly available and  atypical strains of listeria species for which genome sequences of typical strains were already available. while l. marthii was included in our genome sequencing efforts, l. rocourtiae was not as this new species was described after completion of the work reported here.

methods
selection of isolates for genome sequencing
the isolates sequenced in this study  were selected to  cover the full phylogenetic diversity of the genus listeria   <cit> , and to  represent atypical phenotypes  of some non-pathogenic species. l. seeligeri fsl n1- <dig> was selected as a typical hemolytic strain, while l. seeligeri fsl s4- <dig> represents an atypical non-hemolytic strain of the same species. l. marthii fsl s4- <dig> is the type strain of l. marthii and has recently been shown to represent the most closely related species to l. monocytogenes, however it is not pathogenic. l. ivanovii subsp. londoniensis fsl f6- <dig>  represents the type strain of this subspecies and represents the second pathogenic species in listeria. l. monocytogenes fsl f2- <dig> represents lineage iiic, a distinct lineage within l. monocytogenes that has not been sequenced before. l. innocua fsl j1- <dig> was sequenced because this strain represents a atypical hemolytic l. innocua isolate, while fsl s4- <dig> was sequenced as an additional typical non-hemolytic strain of l. innocua to further assess intraspecific genomic variation within l. innocua. hemolytic activity for all strains was previously tested  <cit> .

a a † indicates strains for which the complete genome sequence is publicly available, an * indicates strains that were sequenced as part of the study reported here. the l. ivanovii strain sequenced here is the type strain of l. ivanovii subsp londoniensis . l. monocytogenes fsl r2- <dig>  a duplicate of l. monocytogenes f <dig>  was sequenced to assess the performance of the sequence and genome assembly methods.

b for l. monocytogenes the intraspecific phylogenetic lineage to which the isolates belong is indicated.

c sizes of newly sequenced genomes were derived from the sum of the length of all contigs from the de novo assembly.

d all l. monocytogenes strains were classified as pathogens based on their involvement in clinical cases and/or their virulence in mouse studies  except for l. monocytogenes hcc <dig>  which has been shown to be non-pathogenic  <cit> . the hemolytic l. innocua fsl j1- <dig> was considered non-pathogenic based on its avirulence in a mouse infection experiment  <cit> . all non-hemolytic strains were considered avirulent as they lack the prfa virulence cluster. avirulence for some strains was also supported by animal experiments  or tissue culture data . the hemolytic l. seeligeri strain was considered avirulent as it shows low invasion efficiencies for caco- <dig> cells  and as other hemolytic l. seeligeri strains have been shown to be avirulent in mouse infection experiments  <cit> .

genome sequencing and assembly
genomic dna was isolated using the ultraclean microbial dna isolation kit  according to manufacturer's instructions. listeria genomes were sequenced using the solid™  <dig> system  following manufacturer's protocols. mate-paired libraries with approximately  <dig>  kb inserts were constructed from  <dig> μg of genomic dna, and deposited on one quarter of a flow cell. twenty-five base reads were obtained from each of the f <dig> and r <dig> tags, with  <dig> million to  <dig> million reads obtained for each of the genomes. after correcting errors in colorspace reads using a modified version of the spectral alignment tools from the euler-usr package  <cit> , de novo assembly was performed using the solid™ system de novo accessory tools , which employs the velvet assembly engine  <cit> .

in order to identify likely misassemblies, scaffolds were aligned using mummer  <cit>  to the most closely related reference genome available at the time of the analysis: l. monocytogenes scaffolds were aligned to l. monocytogenes f <dig>  l. innocua and l. marthii scaffolds were aligned to l. innocua clip <dig>  and l. ivanovii and l. seeligeri scaffolds were aligned to l. welshimeri slcc <dig>  scaffolds were broken at points where non-contiguous regions of the reference genome were juxtaposed, and then ordered such that they were syntenic with the reference genome. all scaffolds were then concatenated into a single pseudogenome, separated by the sequence nnnnncacacacttaattaattaagtgtgtgnnnnn, which puts stop codons in all six reading frames. scaffolds that did not match the reference genome were concatenated in arbitrary order at the end of the pseudogenome.

the genome sequences of the seven newly sequenced strains have been deposited to genbank as whole genome shotgun projects .

genome annotation and whole genome alignments
concatenated pseudogenome sequences were run through jcvi's prokaryotic annotation pipeline , which includes gene finding with glimmer, blast-extend-repraze  searches to extend orf finding beyond premature stop codons, hmm searches against pfam  <cit>  and tigrfam  <cit> , tmhmm searches, signalp predictions, and automatic annotations from autoannotate. the manual annotation tool manatee  was used to manually review the output and aid in genome annotation and gene identification. whole genome alignments were created in mauve  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  using the progressive mauve algorithm.

orthologue analyses
initially, orthologues found in six publicly available complete listeria genomes  were identified using blastclust  <cit> . this analysis was limited to these six complete genomes to avoid possible problems with  fragmented draft sequences such as the genome sequences available in the broad institute l. monocytogenes database , at the time of this analysis. only orfs having at least  <dig> nt  were considered in this analysis as smaller orfs were not annotated consistently among the genomes. a set of  <dig>  unique orfs, found among these six complete genomes by requiring 75% aa identity over at least 80%, was used to identify orthologues of these orfs in the new genome assemblies . the 75% identity threshold was selected empirically after running blastclust with a range of percent identity values: requiring more than 75% identity resulted in too many orthologues being split into multiple clusters, and allowing lower values resulted in too many clusters containing paralogues. when an orthologue in a draft assembly was split into two or more fragments, these were considered to be a single match.

orfs identified only in the seven newly sequenced genomes by the jcvi automated sequence annotation pipeline were split at any run of five or more ambiguous amino acids , which resulted from in-frame strings of fifteen or more 'n' between contigs in the assemblies. after splitting, all orfs and orf fragments with length less than  <dig> aa were removed from the set. amino acid sequences of the remaining orfs were screened against the nucleotide sequences of the six previously available finished listeria genomes using tblastn with an identity threshold of 65%, and those without any hits were identified. these novel listeria orfs were screened against all seven draft genome assemblies in order to determine their distribution across the set of strains.

core and pan genome analysis
the mixture model method of snipen et al.  <cit>  was used to estimate the number of genes in  the core genome  and in  the pan-genome . to compare these estimates to another group of gram-positive bacteria that includes closely related pathogens and non-pathogens, the same method was used to estimate the core and pan-genome of the bacillus cereus group, a group that can be considered a single species from taxonomic point of view  <cit> . only the chromosome sequences of five b. anthracis, nine b. cereus, two b. thuringiensis, and one b. weihenstephanensis strain were used for this analysis.

cumulative pan-genome size plots for listeria were calculated by selecting strains without replacement in random order  <dig> times, and then calculating the mean pan-genome size at each sampling point. blast2go  <cit>  was used to perform a functional annotation of the genes found in the core and the pan-genome.

phylogenetic analysis
phylogenetic trees of the listeria isolates were constructed using sequences for  <dig> genes in the core genome of the species studied; these genes were randomly selected form all genes that were previously shown to have no evidence for either positive selection or recombination  <cit>  as these two processes make it problematic to infer the true organismal phylogeny. phylogenetic trees were inferred using neighbor joining, maximum parsimony and minimum evolution phylogenetic reconstruction methods available in the mega package version  <dig>   <cit> . a bayesian analysis was performed using mrbayes  <dig>   <cit>  and the gtr +i+g model of nucleotide evolution. a phylogenetic reconstruction using presence or absence data of genes in the pan genome was performed using the maximum parsimony method in paup* version  <dig> b  <cit> .

to infer the time to the most recent common ancestor of listeria and to infer the approximate age of the individual listeria species, a bayesian molecular clock analysis was performed in beast version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  based on the concatenated  <dig> core genes. one strain from each species or lineage was included in the analysis. the molecular clock analysis was performed using a gtr +i+g nucleotide substitution model, and a relaxed clock model to account for variation in substitution rates. tracer version  <dig> . <dig> was used to assess the proper burn-in and sampling of the model parameters. we used a mutation rate of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per site per year, as suggested by ochman et al.  <cit>  to calibrate the tree.

evolutionary analysis of internalins
as at least some internalins have been shown to be important virulence factors in listeria  we decided to employ a phylogenetic approach to infer the homology and evolution of genes in the internalin gene family. this was specifically important because the jcvi automated annotation pipeline annotated most internalin genes inconsistently as either  internalin a,  leucine-rich repeat containing protein, or  cell wall anchor domain-containing protein. amino acid sequences of orfs predicted to encode internalins or leucine-rich repeat proteins were extracted from the annotated genomes; the newly sequenced genomes were aligned to publicly available, well-annotated genomes  to identify internalin genes that were missed in the initial annotation. after alignment using the einsi strategy in the mafft alignment package  <cit> , internalin aa sequences were used for phylogenetic reconstruction using a maximum parsimony heuristic search in paup*  <dig> b  <cit> . gaps identified in internalin genes were either closed by pcr and sanger sequencing or by reassembly of the raw solid™ system reads using improved versions of the de novo assembly tools. internalins found in l. monocytogenes clip <dig> were not included in this analysis because the majority of the internalins  in this strain are identical  to those found in l. monocytogenes f <dig> 

presence of virulence-associated genes
the presence, in the  <dig> genome sequences analyzed, of  <dig> putative virulence-associated genes previously reported by camejo et al.  <cit>  was assessed using whole genome alignments produced with mauve  <dig> . <dig>  the pvclust r package  <cit>  was used to perform a cluster analysis based on the presence/absence data for genes that showed variable presence/absence.

horizontal gene transfer and mobile elements
sigi-hmm  <cit>  was used to infer if genes in the genomes were acquired through horizontal gene transfer ; this program uses a codon usage based hidden markov model to infer if genes are of alien origin . genes with more than 10% ambiguous sites were excluded from the analyses. the detection sensitivity of sigi-hmm was set to  <dig> . prophages and prophage derived regions were identified using the online version of prophinder  <cit> . the prophinder algorithm searches for regions that are dense in phage-like proteins, using a blastp search  <cit>  against all phage proteins in the aclame database  <cit> . transposons and plasmid related genes were identified with sigi-hmm and through examination of the initial genome annotations for transposon- or plasmid-related genes.

identification of restriction and modification and crispr systems
bacterial defense systems against mobile elements/foreign dna implicated in the reduction of horizontal gene transfer include  restriction-modification  systems  <cit>  and  clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat  systems  <cit> . r-m systems were identified by screening the initial annotation for genes involved in r-m systems. crisprfinder  <cit>  was used to find crispr regions. because the crispr regions consist of highly repetitive regions, which may prove problematic for short read based de novo assembly methods, the annotated genomes were also searched for crispr associated genes . when the presence of the actual crispr region was ambiguous, the presence of cas genes was considered evidence for a functional crispr system.

caco- <dig> invasion assays
the ability to invade human intestinal epithelial cells, a phenotype associated with the presence of inla, was tested for selected strains; the l. marthii strain was not tested as its invasiveness has previously been reported  <cit> . the invasion assays with the human intestinal epithelial cell line caco- <dig> were performed as previously described  <cit> . l. monocytogenes 10403s and isogenic Δinla  strain were included as controls in each invasion assay.

confirmation absence virulence associated genes in non-pathogenic strains
to confirm the absence of critical virulence associated genes  in genomes where these genes were not found, we resequenced the regions where these genes are found in pathogenic strains. the absence of inlc in these non-pathogenic strains was further confirmed by pcr with degenerate primers designed to amplify inlc in l. monocytogenes and l. ivanovii. primer sequences and additional information can be found in additional file  <dig> 

RESULTS
de novo assembly of short sequence reads yields high quality draft genomes for selected listeria species
the genomes of eight listeria strains were sequenced, using mate-paired libraries, on the solid™  <dig> system. the previously sequenced l. monocytogenes strain f <dig>  was included in this set to evaluate assembly of solid™ system reads. mapping of fsl r2- <dig> solid™ system reads to the f <dig> reference genome resulted in 200× median unique coverage depth , with unique coverage gaps only in multicopy loci . the corona_lite snp calling tool identified  <dig> putative snps and  <dig> ambiguities ;  <dig> of these putative snps appeared to be legitimate based on coverage depth. pcr amplification and sanger sequencing confirmed that all  <dig> putative snps represent real differences between the published genome sequence of f <dig> and our isolate of this strain . the four ambiguities were found to be due to single base pair insertions or deletions in fsl r2- <dig> relative to the f <dig> genome. three additional mutational differences  were found in fsl r2- <dig> during sanger sequencing-based confirmation of the snps identified initially. examination of the original trace files for the f <dig> genome indicated that  <dig> of these  <dig> overall differences likely represent sequence errors in the original f <dig> sequence . however, four snps  appear to represent real differences between the f <dig> and fsl r2- <dig> genomes, which most likely arose during laboratory passage, as suggested previously in both l. monocytogenes  <cit>  and bacillus anthracis  <cit> .

most of the fsl r2- <dig> genome was encompassed in eight large scaffolds with the largest scaffold over  <dig>  mb. alignment of this assembly to the f <dig> reference genome indicated that  <dig> % of the genome was covered with identity of  <dig> %, and fewer than ten misassemblies  were observed, indicating a high quality draft genome for fsl r2- <dig>  according to the definition of chain et al.  <cit> .

assembly of the solid™ system reads resulted in  <dig> to  <dig>  contigs per genome ; the sum of the contig lengths ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb, which is comparable to genome sizes of previously sequenced listeria genomes . when non-contiguous genomic regions were found to be juxtaposed in the assembly, the scaffold was broken and reordered to correspond with the reference genome order. the number of potential misassemblies due to illegitimate scaffolding of contigs ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with a median of  <dig>  predicted orf counts  ranged from  <dig>  for l. marthii fsl s4- <dig> to  <dig>  for l. seeligeri fsl n1- <dig> .

a nd = not done. this strain is a duplicate of l. monocytogenes f <dig> and was included to assess the assembly methods used in this study.

the listeria pan-genome is estimated to contain approximately  <dig>  genes, including about  <dig>  core genes
a total of  <dig>  orthologous genes were found among the  <dig> genome sequences analyzed here, including the  <dig> new genome sequences generated. based on these data, a mixture model approach  <cit>  estimated the size of the actual listeria pan-genome as  <dig>  genes, suggesting that over  <dig>  listeria genes remain to be discovered by further sequencing . according to this mixture model approach, the listeria pan-genome best fitted a model with four components including  a component of 31% of the genes with a detection probability of  <dig>  ,  a component of 7% of the genes with a detection probability of  <dig> ,  a component of 10% of the genes with a detection probability of  <dig> , and  a component of 52% of the genes with a detection probability of  <dig>  . the lower bayesian information criterion  of the four-component model  versus that of the three-component model  indicates a better fit. a relatively large part of the estimated pan-genome  was covered by the actual pan-genome inferred from the  <dig> listeria genome sequences. in contrast, only 42% of the estimated pan-genome was covered by the actual pan-genome inferred from the  <dig> genome-sequences of the b. cereus group.

the observed core genome shared by all  <dig> listeria strains comprises  <dig>  genes , while the estimated size of the core genome is  <dig>  genes, indicating that the core genome as defined by this study will change very little as more genomes are sequenced.

while the number of accessory genes observed so far is  <dig> , the estimated total number of accessory genes for the genus listeria  is  <dig> . only a small proportion of orfs in the different listeria genomes was predicted to be introduced by hgt  and only one of these orfs, a collagen binding protein in l. monocytogenes fsl f2- <dig> is potentially associated with virulence. the majority of the genes found in the core genome are involved in metabolic processes  and protein metabolic processes ) and transport , which is congruent with the general notion that the core genome contains genes that are essential for the survival of the organism. genes involved in metabolic processes and transport also dominate the accessory genome  and transport ), which can be explained by the fact that species in listeria have a primarily saprotrophic lifestyle and genes in the accessory genome are putatively involved in the metabolism of specific carbon sources. a large part of the accessory genome , however, cannot be classified according to the gene ontology or is without any significant blast hits to proteins currently in genbank. among these unclassified genes in the accessory genome are hypothetical proteins, proteins involved in phage resistance and prophage associated genes.

a orfs were designated as 'strain specific' if they were only present in one strain  system, ii = type ii r-m system, iii = type iii r-m system, - = no r-m system.

f crispr stands for clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat loci.

g the integrative and conjugative element found in the genome of l. welshimeri  was not reported in the original publication of this genome.

l. seeligeri genome characteristics
a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  orfs were identified in l. seeligeri fsl n1- <dig> and fsl s4- <dig>  respectively ; these orf counts are considerably higher than the  <dig>  orfs recently reported for l. seeligeri slcc <dig>  <cit> . in addition to  <dig> l. seeligeri specific orfs , which included three orfs encoding specific internalin-like genes, we also identified strain specific orfs , including seven and three genes that encode putative internalins . overall,  <dig> and  <dig> internalin genes were found in l. seeligeri fsl n1- <dig> and fsl s4- <dig>  respectively ; by comparison  <dig> internalin-like genes were reported for l. seeligeri slcc <dig>  <cit> . the genomic region harboring inlab in other listeria is completely absent from the l. seeligeri genomes . the inlghe region is absent from the fsl n1- <dig> genome; in fsl s4- <dig> this region contains abc-transporter encoding orfs . consistent with the absence of inla, l. seeligeri fsl n1- <dig> was non-invasive in the caco- <dig> cell invasion assay, with invasion efficiencies similar to the l. monocytogenes 10403s inla null mutant .

the l. seeligeri fsl n1- <dig> prfa cluster  is very similar to the prfa cluster previously described  <cit>  for l. seeligeri with the exception that instead of a duplication of plcb, two short open reading frames , with 62% and 41% similarity to parts of a l. seeligeri plcb sequence are found . the non-hemolytic strain fs s4- <dig> is characterized by the absence of the prfa cluster as also confirmed by pcr ; however, the two orfs  reported to be lost in the non-hemolytic isolates analyzed by volokhov et al.  <cit>  are present in the remains of the fsl s4- <dig> prfa cluster .

evidence for the presence of a plasmid was found for the hemolytic l. seeligeri fsl n1-067; the initial annotation identified six orfs that were annotated as two resolvases, a replication associated protein and a ltrc-like conjugative protein. blast searches of these plasmid-related and adjacent proteins revealed a high identity to proteins encoded on the l. innocua clip <dig> plasmid pli <dig>  the sequence of this plasmid was used as a query to identify more plasmid-derived contigs in l. seeligeri fsl n1- <dig>  p-rast annotation  <cit>  of these contigs and comparison to the pli <dig> plasmid identified plasmid related contigs that encoded  <dig> putative orfs, including  <dig> orfs with homology to genes found in pli <dig> . these contigs totaled  <dig>  bp, representing an estimate of the minimum plasmid size . some of the predicted genes on this plasmid are involved in cadmium, arsenic and multi-drug resistance, consistent with previous reports of plasmid-associated cadmium and arsenic resistance genes in l. monocytogenes  <cit> . two different r-m systems were found in the genome of l. seeligeri fsl n1-067; a mjaxip specific type i system and an ecopi specific type iii system. only one type i restriction modification system was found in the non-hemolytic l. seeligeri strain fsl s4- <dig>  a crispr system was identified in fsl n1- <dig>  but not in fsl s4- <dig> , suggesting differences in phage resistance between the two strains.

l. ivanovii subsp. londoniensis genome characteristics
a total of  <dig>  orfs were identified in the l. ivanovii subsp. londoniensis genome, which contains one prophage and two monocin-like regions . presence of a functional crispr system was inferred from the presence of cas genes. the l. ivanovii genome included  <dig> genes that putatively encode internalins ; the inlab region  contains seven orfs, including five that encode internalins . consistent with the presence of an inla homologue, l. ivanovii subsp. londoniensis fsl f6- <dig> showed caco- <dig> cell invasion efficiency comparable to l. monocytogenes 10403s .

l. innocua genome characteristics
a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  orfs were identified in the genome sequences for the non-hemolytic l. innocua fsl s4- <dig> and the hemolytic l. innocua fsl j1- <dig>  only three genes were exclusively found in all three l. innocua genomes ; lin <dig>  which encodes a putative transcriptional regulator and lin <dig> and lin <dig>  which both encode hypothetical proteins. noteworthy among the strain specific orfs  are three orfs encoding genes involved in cobalt transport systems in strain fsl j1- <dig>  no prophage regions were identified in the genome of the hemolytic l. innocua strain fsl j1- <dig>  while the non-hemolytic strains clip <dig> and fsl s4- <dig> contain five and four prophage regions, respectively. the number of internalin genes in the l. innocua genomes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . the inlab region of the hemolytic l. innocua only contains a homologue of inla; inlb is absent as previously reported  <cit> . consistent with these findings, the hemolytic l. innocua fsl j1- <dig>  which contains inla, shows average caco- <dig> invasion efficiencies comparable to l. monocytogenes 10403s , while the non-hemolytic l. innocua fsl s4- <dig> was non-invasive, with invasion efficiencies similar to those for the l. monocytogenes 10403s inla null mutant .

modification and restriction systems were present in all three l. innocua genomes . l. innocua clip <dig> and fsl s4- <dig> harbor a type i r-m system, while the hemolytic l. innocua fsl j1- <dig> has two type ii r-m systems, a sau3ai specific system and an ecorv specific system . crispr systems are present in the genomes of clip <dig> and fsl s4- <dig>  but were not found in fsl j1- <dig> 

l. marthii genome characteristics
a total of  <dig>  orfs were identified in the l. marthii fsl s4- <dig> genome, including  <dig> orfs exclusively found in this strain . prophinder found no evidence for the presence of prophages, however one monocin region was detected. among the genomes examined here, the l. marthii genome has the highest percentage  of orfs that are introduced through hgt . one of the regions introduced by hgt in l. marthii is a genomic island that encodes for part of a lantibiotic biosynthesis gene cluster. we also identified  <dig> genes that were only found in the genomes of l. marthii and the l. monocytogenes lineage iiic strain fsl f2-208; blast searches against genbank revealed that the eight of these genes were also found in other l. monocytogenes lineage iii and iv genomes . while  <dig> internalin-like genes were found in the l. marthii genome, the inlab region did not contain any internalin-like genes as confirmed by pcr and the inlghe region contained one orf encoding an abc transporter and a homolog of inlc <dig> . the l. marthii genome contains a type i r-m system and a crispr system.

l. monocytogenes genome characteristics
a total of  <dig>  orfs were identified in l. monocytogenes lineage iiic strain fsl f2- <dig> , which is similar to the number of orfs identified in other l. monocytogenes genomes. only four genes were shared between all l. monocytogenes genomes but not found in the genomes of any of the other species; lmof2365_ <dig> , lmof2365_ <dig> , lmof2365_ <dig>  and lmof2365_ <dig> . while the number of prophages identified ranged from zero to three , all l. monocytogenes genomes contained one monocin region, except hcc <dig>  which seems to lack a monocin region. the chromosome of l. monocytogenes fsl f2- <dig> contains a region with high similarity to a putative conjugative element ctn <dig> found in clostridium difficile  <cit> ; this region contains one orf encoding a putative virulence factor, a collagen adhesion protein. the number of internalin-like genes in the l. monocytogenes genomes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . the inlab region is highly variable, however all genomes examined here contain orfs with homology to inla and inlb . the inlghe region is completely absent from the hcc <dig> genome; in fsl f2- <dig>  this region seems to only contain an inlc <dig> homolog . all l. monocytogenes genomes, with the exception of the egd-e genome, contain r-m systems .

phylogenetic analyses identify sister groups containing pathogenic and non-pathogenic listeria species
alignment of the  <dig> concatenated genes that were used for phylogenetic reconstruction comprised  <dig>  nucleotide sites, including  <dig>  variable sites; the average pairwise nucleotide identity based on the  <dig> genes was  <dig> %. all methods except maximum parsimony yielded similar topologies, placing l. seeligeri and l. ivanovii in one well-supported clade  and l. welshimeri basal to another well supported clade containing l. innocua, l. marthii and l. monocytogenes . within the l. innocua/l. marthii/l. monocytogenes clade, l. innocua is the most divergent species, while l. marthii forms a sister group to l. monocytogenes. all phylogenetic relationships within this clade are well supported . the maximum parsimony tree differs from the other trees by its placement of l. welshimeri within the l. seeligeri/l. ivanovii clade. while neighbor joining, maximum likelihood, minimum evolution and parsimony methods do not find any significant bootstrap support for the placement of l. welshimeri in the phylogeny, the bayesian analysis supports placement of l. welshimeri as a basal taxon to the l. innocua/l. marthii/l. monocytogenes clade with a highly significant posterior probability .

a maximum parsimony phylogeny based on the presence and absence of orthologous genes yielded in a single tree  with topology similar to the tree based on bayesian, minimum evolution, maximum likelihood and neighbor joining phylogenetic inference of the  <dig> gene sequence dataset. the only differences are the placement of l. monocytogenes fsl f2- <dig> and l. innocua fsl j1- <dig>  in the gene content-based phylogeny, the hemolytic l. innocua fsl j1- <dig> strain is placed is outside of the clade containing the two non-hemolytic l. innocua strains. l. monocytogenes fsl f2- <dig> is placed in a well-supported  clade together with l. marthii. this placement can be mainly attributed to  <dig> genes that were only found in the l. monocytogenes fsl f2- <dig> genome and the l. marthii genome .

a molecular clock analysis of the 100-gene phylogeny, calibrated with the mutation rate proposed by ochman et al. , places the time of most recent common ancestor  of listeria  at  <dig> million years ago  with a 95% highest probability density  of  <dig> mya to  <dig> mya. the time of divergence of l. welshimeri from the mrca of l. innocua, l. marthii and l. monocytogenes was estimated at  <dig> mya . l. innocua is estimated to have diverged from the mrca of l. monocytogenes and l. marthii at  <dig> mya . l. marthii and l. monocytogenes were estimated to have diverged from each other around the same time as the divergence of l. seeligeri and l. ivanovii . because the mutation rate proposed by ochman et al.  <cit>  is based on the divergence of escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, it may not be applicable to other bacteria. we therefore used the sequence divergence of 16s rrna between l. monocytogenes and l. ivanovii to infer the putative age of the mrca of listeria. the divergence between l. monocytogenes and l. ivanovii is  <dig>  to  <dig> % , which would translate to dating the mrca at  <dig> to  <dig> mya, given the universal 16s rrna divergence rate of 1% per  <dig> million years proposed by ochmann and wilson  <cit> .

while non-pathogenic listeria have fewer virulence associated genes, gene presence patterns for these genes identify only internalin c as a gene that differentiates pathogenic and non-pathogenic listeria
out of  <dig> putative virulence-associated genes previously reported  <cit>  ,  <dig> were found in all  <dig> genomes analyzed. only  <dig> of these genes  were variable in their presence between genomes , including three putative virulence-associated genes that were found solely in the l. monocytogenes egd-e genome. using a hierarchical cluster analysis based on the presence or absence of the  <dig> variable genes, the strains were subdivided into two clusters, including  a cluster composed of l. ivanovii subsp. londoniensis, all l. monocytogenes strains and the hemolytic l. innocua strain and  a cluster composed of only non-pathogenic strains .

a the genes listed here are based on  <dig> putative virulence associated genes reported by camejo et al.  <cit> . only  <dig> genes found to show variable presence among the  <dig> genomes analyzed here are shown. the absence of the prfa-cluster, inla, inlb and inlc was additionally confirmed by pcr and in some cases sequencing .

b lm = l. monocytogenes; li hly- <dig> = l. innocua clip  <dig> ; li hly- <dig> = l. innocua fsl s4- <dig> ; li hly+ = l. innocua fsl j1- <dig> ; lma = l. marthii fsl s4-120; lw = l. welshimeri slcc5334; liv = l. ivanovii subsp. londoniensis atcc 49954; ls hly+= l. seeligeri fsl n1- <dig> ; ls hly-= l. seeligeri fsl s4- <dig> .

other than the prfa virulence cluster, the only gene that is absent from strains in the non-pathogen cluster but present in the first cluster is inla, encoding internalin a, a key determinant of host intestinal cell invasion. the inlc gene, encoding internalin c, is the only gene that differentiates pathogens  from non-pathogens . there is a significant  difference between pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains in the number of variable virulence-associated genes, with  <dig> to  <dig> genes present in pathogenic strains and  <dig> to  <dig> genes present in non-pathogenic strains.

all listeria strains contain multiple internalin-encoding genes with  <dig> internalin genes present in both main clades of the genus listeria
a total of  <dig> putative internalin genes were identified in the genomes examined here; the number of internalin genes ranged from  <dig> internalins in l. welshimeri slcc <dig> to  <dig> internalins in l. monocytogenes clip <dig> . the number of internalin genes in the non-pathogenic strains  was significantly lower as compared to the number in pathogenic strains . within the internalin gene tree , three main clades can be recognized, including  a clade containing inla, inlb, inlc, inlf, internalin genes found in the inlghe region and related internalin genes,  a clade containing inli and inlj, and  a clade of genes encoding mainly uncharacterized internalin-like proteins. none of these three clades is supported by a significant posterior probability. we also identified  <dig> clades , all with a significant posterior probability , that each contain genes from isolates of both the l. monocytogenes/l. marthii/l. innocua clade  as well as the l. seeligeri/l. ivanovii clade , supporting a mrca that contained these internalin genes. although some of these  <dig> internalin gene clades  contained only a single sequence for one of the two listeria clades, the internalin genes found in l. ivanovii and l. seeligeri  are generally highly divergent from their clade a homologues , which supports presence of these genes in the mrca as opposed to introduction by horizontal gene transfer.

discussion
high quality draft genomes can be obtained through de novo assembly of short read sequences
the emergence and maturation of next generation sequencing  technology, driven in large part by efforts to develop approaches that allow for completion of a human genome for $ <dig>   <cit> , has made possible rapid, inexpensive, and high-throughput microbial whole-genome analysis, which promises to improve our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis, and our ability to detect and control infectious diseases. our data show that ngs data facilitate de novo assembly and analyses of bacterial genomes. although these draft genomes can have up to thousands of sequence gaps, the quality of the assembly is sufficient for automated annotation, and subsequent comparative genomics analyses, particularly when studying a conserved group of organisms such as the listeria species examined here. thus, ngs represents a feasible approach for rapid and comprehensive pathogen identification, subtyping, source tracking, and surveillance  <cit> , and has the potential to be developed, in the long term, into routine diagnostic applications. the utility of draft genomes for identification of candidate vaccine targets has also been recently demonstrated  <cit> .

the genus listeria sensu stricto has a pan-genome characterized by limited introduction of new genetic material with  <dig>  core and  <dig>  accessory genes identified to date
our data show that the members of the genus listeria have a highly conserved genome with limited acquisition, from other gene pools, of homologous and non-homologous genes, even though horizontal transfer of homologous genes within and between listeria species has clearly been shown to occur  <cit> . although the pangenome of the genus listeria is not closed, there seems to be very limited on-going introduction of new genetic material from external gene pools . data supporting this limited introduction of new genetic material into the pangenome include  the observation that the core and accessory genes identified among the  <dig> genomes analyzed represent a large proportion  of the predicted pan-genome,  the similarity in size of observed core genome  and predicted core genome , suggesting limited gene loss and deletion,  highly conserved estimated genome size ,  a relatively small fraction  of genes that have atypical codon usage, and  a small number of prophages and transposons. the fact that most of these prophages have a codon usage pattern that is similar to their host indicates that they have co-evolved with their listeria hosts  <cit> . a listeria pan-genome characterized by limited introduction of genetic material is also supported by the observation that pan-genome coverage for the genus listeria  is higher than the pan-genome coverage estimates for most bacterial species, which range from 30%  to 73%   <cit> . a pan-genome coverage estimate performed for the bacillus cereus group, a group of closely related pathogenic and non-pathogenic gram-positive species, revealed a coverage of 42%, indicating pan-genome coverage of listeria, is also high compared to gram-positive organisms. the bacillus cereus group, however, can be considered a single species from a taxonomic perspective  <cit> . in the case of listeria this measure of shared gene content should not be interpreted to mean that listeria species are very closely related and may in fact comprise one species. on the contrary, the listeria species have diverged substantially in the primary sequence of their core genes with an average pair-wise nucleotide identity of  <dig> %, compared to average pair-wise nucleotide identities within species of  <dig> % in f. tularensis  <cit>  and  <dig> % in e. coli  <cit> . phillipy et al.  <cit>  predicted a closed pan-genome for the species l. monocytogenes, which is congruent with our observations for the complete genus.

the mechanism behind the limited occurrence of gene acquisition from outside gene pools in listeria remains to be determined. although several strains harbor an insertion of prophage a <dig> in the comk open reading frame, which encodes a transcriptional regulator of competence, comk is intact in l. marthii, l. innocua fsl j1- <dig> and fsl s4- <dig>  and l. ivanovii subsp. londoniensis, as well as the previously sequenced l. monocytogenes f <dig> and hcc <dig> genomes. while most of the competence related genes are present in all listeria genomes  <cit>  and while evidence for homologous recombination has been detected by multiple studies  <cit> , natural competence has not yet been report for any listeria strains  <cit> . limited natural competence may thus at least partially explain the low level of gene acquisition from outside gene pools, particularly since our data suggest that most listeriophages do are part of the closed listeria pangenome. in addition, limited gene acquisition in the genus listeria may also be facilitated by the presence, in all genomes of the genus examined so far, of well-developed defense system against foreign dna/mobile elements, including r-m systems  <cit>  and/or crispr systems  <cit> . both systems have been shown to limit or block horizontal gene transfer in staphylococcus aureus  <cit> . this would explain why functional transposable elements are virtually absent from listeria, and if present  contain a putative anti-restriction gene, which protects them from the restriction modification system.

despite the overall high conservation of genome content across different listeria species, gene loss and deletion events, as well as introduction of genetic material through horizontal gene transfer from other gene pools occurs in this genus, often with phenotypic consequences. for example, the chromosomal region that contains inlab in l. monocytogenes and l. ivanovii appears to be hypervariable with evidence for deletion events  and horizontal introduction of genetic material from other genera , consistent with another report  <cit>  that also suggested putative horizontal gene transfer events in this region.

while listeria includes a number of species-like clades, many of these putative species include subclades or strains with atypical virulence-associated characteristics and gene profiles
generally, within the genus listeria, only members of the species l. monocytogenes are considered to be human pathogens, while members of the species l. ivanovii are considered to be animal pathogens  <cit> . key genes that clearly contribute to virulence, as supported by experimental evidence, include  genes located in the prfa cluster, which are critical for intracellular survival and cell to cell spread  <cit> ,  inla and inlb, which are critical for invasion of intestinal epithelial and hepatic cells, respectively  <cit> , and  inlc, which encodes a protein that is specifically required for cell-to-cell spread  <cit> . strains representing l. monocytogenes lineages i, ii, and iii as well as the l. ivanovii subsp. londoniensis strains contained the full complement of these virulence genes , consistent with the experimentally verified virulence of these organisms  <cit> . our full genome analyses suggest that the evolution from a listeria ancestor that contained all three virulence loci yielded species and strains that have lost one or more of these key virulence genes. l. welshimeri, the majority of l. innocua strains, and non-hemolytic l. seeligeri strains lack all three of these virulence loci, consistent with their observed avirulence  <cit> .

other strains are lacking only a subset of the key virulence genes found in most l. monocytogenes and l. ivanovii. hemolytic l. seeligeri carries the prfa cluster, but lacks inlab and inlc, consistent with its avirulence in mammalian tissue culture and animal models  <cit> . interestingly, some strains  contain the prfa cluster as well as inla and have the ability to invade human intestinal epithelial cells, while lacking inlc and showing avirulence in a mouse model  <cit> . similarly, at least one l. monocytogenes strain  contains the prfa cluster as well as inlab, while lacking inlc and showing avirulence in mouse infection experiments  <cit> . these strains represent a particular challenge for virulence classification, as they would typically be classified as virulent with standard assays . overall, our data, along with previously reported virulence characterizations of isolates representing different listeria species as well as atypical strains   <cit> , clearly indicate the need for a well-designed molecular approach to define pathogenic strains within the genus listeria. while we hypothesize that use of multiple marker genes, e.g., genes in the prfa cluster, inla , inlb, and inlc is needed to identify virulent strains, further tissue culture and animal studies are needed to confirm appropriate marker genes. in addition, further comparative genomics studies of phenotypically variable listeria will be needed to identify and validate diagnostic targets and markers.

the genus listeria represents two main clades that diverged from a common ancestor that contained the prfa cluster and a number of internalin genes, most likely  <dig> million years ago
the use of  <dig> core genes that have been previously shown to show no evidence for positive selection nor homologous recombination resulted in a robust phylogeny dividing listeria  into two main clades;  a clade consisting of l. monocytogenes, l. marthii, l. innocua and l. welshimeri, and  a clade consisting of l. ivanovii and l. seeligeri. the existence of two main clades has been shown in several previous studies  <cit> , however the placement of l. welshimeri has always been ambiguous. while some studies placed l. welshimeri basal in the l. seeligeri/l. ivanovii clade  <cit> , others  <cit> , like the majority of the phylogenetic reconstruction methods used here, place l. welshimeri basal in the l. monocytogenes/l. marthii/l. innocua clade. a likely explanation for this ambiguous phylogenetic placement is the "long branch attraction effect"  <cit>  as l. welshimeri is placed on a long branch and seems to have branched off of the mrca of the l. monocytogenes/l. marthii/l. innocua clade relatively early during the evolutionary of listeria sensu stricto. as likelihood-based methods are less prone to long branch attraction  <cit> , placement, by these methods, of l. welshimeri in the l. monocytogenes/l. marthii/l. innocua clade suggests that this placement is correct.

our data also seem to support a hypothesis that the most recent common ancestor  of listeria possessed not only the prfa virulence cluster as indicated before  <cit> , but also many internalins including a, b and c, which are essential for host invasion  <cit>  and cell-to-cell spread  <cit> . while a few studies  <cit>  have previously explored the evolution of internalin multigene family, including one study  <cit>  that proposed presence of inlb in the mrca of listeria , our analysis allowed for identification of  <dig> internalin genes that, like inlb, were likely present in the mrca of listeria sensu stricto.

based on a bayesian molecular clock analysis that used  <dig> genes of the listeria core genome places, we propose that the mrca of the genus listeria  can be dated to about  <dig> to  <dig> mya, similar to the date has been inferred for the most recent ancestor of s. enterica and s. bongori  <cit> . a plausible hypothesis for emergence of these pathogens during this time period is that a major mammalian radiation during this same epoch  <cit>  provided strains of listeria and salmonella that were able to colonize mammalian hosts with a selective advantage over less adapted or environmental strains.

loss of virulence associated genes is a recurrent evolutionary pattern in listeria
while a number of studies have reported that gene loss and genome reduction are general patterns in the evolutionary transition from facultative pathogenic lifestyles to obligate pathogenic lifestyles in bacteria  <cit> , our data suggest that gene loss events in multiple genomic regions and lineages coincided with multiple evolutionary transitions of listeria from a facultative pathogenic lifestyle to an obligate saprotrophic lifestyle. the switch from a facultative pathogen to obligate saprotrophic clades seems to have occurred at least four times during the evolutionary history of listeria sensu stricto, including  during the speciation event leading to l. seeligeri, which coincided with the loss of the inlab operon and inlc, but not the prfa cluster,  the speciation event leading to l. welshimeri, which coincided with loss of the prfa cluster, the inlab operon and inlc,  the speciation event leading to l. innocua, which coincided with the loss of inlb and inlc and  the speciation event leading to l. marthii, which coincided with the loss of the prfa cluster, the inlab operon and inlc. secondary losses of additional virulence-associated genes occurred in the non-hemolytic l. seeligeri, which lost the prfa cluster, and non-hemolytic l. innocua strains, which lost the prfa cluster as well as inla.

despite the observation that loss of virulence genes appears to be a key event in the evolution of listeria species, several apparently avirulent listeria strains  have strongly conserved, and in most cases functional, homologues of key l. monocytogenes virulence genes in their genomes. for example, previous studies  <cit>  demonstrated some functionality of different l. seeligeri virulence factors and our data suggest that the homologue of internalin a in the hemolytic l. innocua strain supports the ability to invade human intestinal epithelial cells . one hypothesis is that the virulence genes in listeria play a role in the survival of and defense against predation by protists, however this hypothesis is not supported by a recent study that demonstrates that l. monocytogenes does not survive ingestion by the amoeba acanthamoeba polyphaga  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in order to gain an improved understanding of genome evolution in members of the genus listeria, with a particular attention to the evolution of virulence, we generated draft genomes for seven listeria strains focusing on species for which genome sequences were not previously available and atypical strains of species for which genome sequences were available . analysis of  <dig> genome sequences representing six listeria species  suggests that  the genus listeria possesses an open pan-genome with limited ongoing introduction of new genetic material,  modern pathogenic and non-pathogenic listeria species originated, approx. 40- <dig> mya, from a common ancestor that contained the prfa cluster and at least  <dig> internalin genes, and  gene loss events played a key role in the evolution of listeria. while diversification over this time period yielded a number of species-like clades in the genus listeria, many of these putative species include clades or strains with atypical virulence characteristics and gene profiles. this information will be critical for the development of genetic and genomic criteria for pathogenic strains, including development of assays that specifically target pathogenic listeria strains regardless of species classification.
