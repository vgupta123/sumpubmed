BACKGROUND
the sonic hedgehog /gli pathway orchestrates several processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and stem cell maintenance  <cit> . shh acts as a secreted protein ligand that binds to the 12-transmembrane receptor ptc <dig> . this binding releases ptc <dig> repression of the 7-transmembrane co-receptor smoothened, which in turn favours intracellular accumulation of activator forms of the gli transcription factors . in vertebrates, at least three gli proteins  have been described. these zinc-finger transcription factors enter the nucleus and bind specific sequences  in the genome known as gli binding sites , promoting expression of target genes, including ptc <dig> and gli <dig> themselves  <cit> . in the absence of ligand, ptc <dig> represses smoothened activity and the repressor forms of the transcription factors gli  enter the nucleus and inhibit hh target gene transcription. the relative ratio of gli-a/gli-r forms is considered to be crucial for interpreting the extracellular hh gradient and for determining concentration-dependent cell fates  <cit> . due the multiple developmental and growth processes where the hh/gli pathway has been implicated, it is likely that the cellular outcome involves a high number of target genes. to date, based on the identification of a gli binding motif within their regulatory sequences, no more than a dozen target genes have been characterized to be activated or inhibited by gli activity in vertebrates. several in silico and experimental genomic analyses, such as chip-seq and chip-chip, have been recently made to identify new gene direct targets, mainly identifying putative gbs near the transcriptional start site of genes  <cit> . however, it has been shown that different genomic strategies yield different hedgehog target lists.

in order to contribute to the identification of new gbs we applied a recently described yeast-based screen  <cit>  using mouse and zebrafish genomic libraries. this versatile yeast strategy allowed us to rapidly and efficiently identify genomic targets of gli-binding proteins. bioinformatic analyses  were performed to determine the presence of enriched elements upstream or in the first intron of putative targets identified by our one-hybrid assay. using this heterologous approach, we were able to identify several novel gli-binding sequences located close to genes previously not connected to the shh/gli pathway. due to the high conservation of the hh/gli pathway in vertebrates, some of the identified putative targets were further analyzed, both in-vitro using a mouse hh reporter fibroblast cell line, and in-vivo in zebrafish embryos, confirming their predicted regulation through hh loss and gain-of-function experiments. the high rate of identified target genes supports our unbiased approach and shows the potency of this method for finding novel target genes.

RESULTS
yeast-based screens identify gli protein-binding sequences
in order to identify possible gbs, we used our recently described yeast-based assay that uses mouse and zebrafish libraries with random genomic fragments upstream of the yeast ura <dig> promoter  <cit> . the zebrafish library had an average genomic fragment size of  <dig> bp, and contains approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> independent clones providing a 4- to 6-fold coverage of the genome, while the mouse library contains  <dig>  ×  <dig> independent clones with an average size of  <dig> bp, representing an average of 3- to 4-fold coverage of the genome. mata yeast containing the genome library fragment plasmids were mated separately to matα yeast containing an expression plasmid for either the full-length zebrafish gli <dig> or the zinc-finger domain of the mouse gli <dig> protein, following a standard two-hybrid mating protocol, screening afterwards a total of  <dig> clones  <cit> . clones were then re-screened for a ura <dig> phenotype and the genomic fragment was pcr amplified using primers flanking the genomic library. sequencing a total of  <dig> single product colony-pcr reactions, we successfully obtained  <dig> potential binding sequences for the mouse library, and  <dig> for the zebrafish library.

meme and mast analysis predict multiple shh/gli target genes
the consensus gbs, gaccaccca, was first described by the vogelstein group  <cit> . several other genes that have been reported as targets of gli <dig> in different biological processes, posses motifs with distinct degrees of similarity to the consensus sequences in their upstream regions. these motifs were able to bind a recombinant form of gli <dig> in gel-shift assays  <cit> . from the  <dig> sequences obtained from the yeast assay, we manually curated them based on two criteria: first, we considered those sequences mapping within  <dig> kb of the transcriptional start of a gene or to the first intron, and second, we ruled out sequences that have been described as repetitive in multiple genome assemblies. we therefore did not consider the intergenic repetitive sequences, although they show tandem repeats that probably could bind the gli transcription factors. nevertheless, for the purpose of this study, they were discarded based on the fact that they do not show the gli consensus binding sites or other known transcription factor binding sites. next, we selected for further analysis and logo generation the mouse sequences since they fulfilled our request of mapping criteria. this yielded a list of  <dig>  mouse sequences, with final  <dig> non-redundant sequences , mapped to specific genes based on shortest distance to the transcriptional start site. these sequences were used as input for a meme search.

as shown in figure 1a, we used the meme  <cit>  algorithm to identify overrepresented motifs in the group of  <dig> sequences . a predicted site, a  <dig> bp motif , contained the core consensus of gbs as described in  <cit> . the position-dependent scoring matrix for the  <dig> bp motif was used as input to the mast algorithm to search similar motifs in a  <dig> kb upstream region and in the first intron of  <dig> candidate genes, including ptc <dig>  candidate genes were selected based on gene ontology associations, to cover a wide array of cellular and developmental processes . figure 1b shows the representative logos of potential gli-binding sites identified in the non-coding regions of the selected genes, for each gene the number of sequences that matched to the  <dig> bp motif is indicated in the brackets right next to gene name.

we also checked the sequences for interspecies conservation, finding a high percentage for some of them in a murine/human comparison , partial human/murine conservation for others , some with murine-only conservation , and finally some with no conservation at all  .

putative gli-targets genes display altered mrna levels after pharmacological blockage or activation of hh/gli signaling pathway
assessing whether regulatory elements are occupied in-vivo requires experimental confirmation. in order to address whether any of the putative  <dig> target genes are affected by hh pathway loss of function, we made use of the reporter cell line c3h10t1/ <dig> and assayed the candidate target genes for their response to hh signaling by quantitative rt-pcr . cells were cultured in the presence of the hh/gli pathway inhibitor cyclopamine   and three time points were considered  to account for differences in the temporal transcriptional response of putative gli-target genes and for differences in the stability of mrnas produced under gli control. vehicle control  was used as reference.

all the selected candidate genes showed reductions in their mrna levels after 24-hour cyc treatments except glra . to corroborate hh regulation we performed gain of function experiments using purmorphamine , a proven smoothened agonist  <cit>  for a subset of candidates, namely neo <dig>  c-myc and sfrp <dig> based on their implication in developmental processes. cells were treated for  <dig> hours and  <dig> hours before rna extraction and qpcr processing. ptc <dig>  a well known hh transcriptional readout was used as positive control. for both c-myc and neo <dig> significant changes could be observed after 24-hours of treatment, nevertheless the increases was less pronounced in comparison to ptc <dig>  in order to proof that the effects of hh signaling were direct we included experiments with cycloheximide , obtaining similar results . increase in transcript levels of the selected target genes became clearly evident after  <dig> hours of treatment. sfrp <dig> did not show any changes in expression for either time point . sfrp <dig> invariant mrna levels possibly points to a context dependent case of regulation. expression changes were calculated related to vehicle treatments .

based on the gli-specific effect on transcription of novel target genes obtained by the screening and further in-vitro validation experiments for neo <dig>  c-myc and sfrp <dig>  we also verified hh regulation of these genes by whole mount in situ hybridization  in zebrafish embryos. besides allowing a relatively rapid verification of gene expression in different hh-manipulated embryos, this approach provides spatial information and insights about the nature of regulation by hh signaling. because the shh/gli pathway plays a central role in neural development, particularly in the development of the central nervous system , we choose these known developmental genes not previously reported to be regulated by shh signaling.

neogenin  <dig> is positively regulated by the shh/gli pathway in in the cns
neogenin  <dig> is a multifunctional transmembrane receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily with known roles in angiogenesis, progenitor proliferation and axon guidance  <cit> . at  <dig> hours post fertilization  neo <dig> expression was strongly detected in the wild- type cns, where it was associated with proliferative zones . of note, neo <dig> was also detected in the notochord . ish analysis shows no staining in the notochord and the retinal ganglion cell layer of the eye in dtr  and smu  mutants .

in addition to genetic loss-of-function, we complemented our analysis by treating embryos with the shh/gli activator pur. of note, in particular notochord expression is increased when compared to mock dmso treated embryos .

c-myc is regulated by the shh/gli pathway in the cns and liver
we next asked whether c-myc , a multifunctional gene directly related to cell cycle progression  and implicated in a variety of cancers, is regulated by shh  <cit> . at  <dig> hpf wild-type c-myc expression is found in the posterior margin of the optic tectum, recently identified as an important proliferative zone in the dorsal brain of teleosts   <cit> . the mrna can also be detected in the eye and liver . in the smu mutant, expression in cns and liver was completely diminished . dtr mutants did not show any c-myc staining; expression is regionally lost in the dorsal midbrain, eye and liver  whereas the yot  mutant has a reduced expression in the eye while c-myc was still detectable in the tectum and liver . thus, ish analysis corroborated the changes in c-myc expression levels that were previously determined by qpcr assays.

sfrp <dig> gene is regulated by the shh pathway in slow muscle and pharyngeal arches
the sfrp <dig> gene encodes a protein that binds wnt ligands through a cystein-rich domain . it has been implicated in both antagonism of wnt signaling  <cit>  and beta-catenin stabilization  <cit> . ish analysis verified that sfrp <dig> transcripts can be detected in adaxial cells, pectoral fins and branchial arches by the  <dig> hpf stage, as previously reported  <cit> . adaxial cell expression is absent in yot mutants, and expression is also regionally lost in the cns . pectoral fins do not display any changes in sfrp <dig> expression. this is consistent with the reported alterations in myogenesis in yot mutants, where slow muscle genesis is affected  <cit> . while it is known that a gradient of wnt signaling opposes the shh signaling gradient in the neural tube, regulation of sfrp <dig> in the brain by shh has not previously been demonstrated.

to further examine whether sfrp <dig> is regulated by shh we used pharmacological gain and loss of function approaches. sfrp <dig> expression is increased in pur treated embryos in comparison to its vehicle treatment . although cyc inhibitor does not ablate completely expression in the cns, expression in the developing pharyngeal arch is abolished. . this might be due to the fact that treatments were started at  <dig> hpf, due to an extremely high mortality rate in treatment initiated prior to that time. the failure to detect sfrp <dig> regulation in the first reporter cell assay demonstrates the necessity to test regulation in the proper, in-vivo context.

discussion
the hedgehog pathway has been extensively studied. many studies take advantage of high throughput approaches at different levels, for example by identifying the post-translational modifiers mediating hh signaling  <cit> , by mapping gbs and gli responding genes in silico  <cit>  or in different cellular models  <cit> . in general, chip assays utilize specific pcr primers flanking a suspected binding site to determine whether the site is occupied. still, recent studies suggest that these regions, at least for mammalian genomes, are more complex than previously imagined and therefore chip-on chip may miss some regulatory regions. chip-seq is another approach, but like chip-on chip, it requires high quality antibodies to the transcription factor of interest. the latter has been a big handicap particularly in the hh/gli field; the development of chip grade of gli antibodies is still a matter of intense research. to improve the number of target genes associated with the shh/gli pathway, we performed a yeast-based genomic screening assay combined with in silico analysis in order to characterize novel gli interacting sequences. yeast-based method has been successfully applied to identify transcription factor target genes in  <cit> .

identifying new hh targets using a yeast-based method
our strategy shows that sequences obtained by the yeast based method possess potential binding sites for gli transcription factor whose consensus matches the  <dig> bp core previously described. this method has the advantage that it allows transcription binding site identification for gbs that potentially cannot be found using other strategies. of note, we found fragments that contain putative gbs sequences slightly different from what has been previously reported as consensus sequences . variations of these gbs lead us to examine whether a correlation existed between these changes and dna binding domains for gli family members. zinc fingers  <dig> and  <dig>  responsible for binding to the consensus sequence  <cit> , are highly conserved specifically in the residues involved in contact with bases or phosphates. lack of correlation between changes in individual consensus gbs sequences and dna binding domains lead us to propose that these motifs might correspond to non-consensus binding sites for gli <dig> with different affinities for the transcription factor. this hypothesis has been partially addressed in other works. in  <cit>  for example, mutations of consensus gbs has been useful to predict potential targets for gli family in mammalian enhancers, based in the effect of these mutations on activation of a luciferase reporter. these data indicate that variations from consensus gbs can affect gene expression levels, as also described in  <cit> . in  <cit> , an essential binding site from ptc <dig> promoter, with a single substitution from the consensus gbs sequence, was mutated to investigate the effect of change bases in the expression of a reporter gene, resulting in different non-consensus and low affinity gli binding sites that could lead to transcriptional activation.

several models have been proposed for hh activation of target genes. gli proteins can bind to regulatory regions and directly either activate or repress transcription. in drosophila  <cit>  a differential affinity model seems to represent hh/ci signaling in the wing imaginal disc. it remains to be seen whether hh signaling in vertebrates follows a similar mechanism. we cannot rule out a role of gli repressors  in the physiological regulation of the new gli target genes identified in this paper. the fact that we see increased expression of ptc <dig>  however, leads us to associate this regulation preferentially to gli activator function. it remains to be defined whether gli repressor assays yield the same targets as gli activators.

a very interesting result of our work is the fact that we were able to mate yeast zebra fish or mouse gli constructs to either homologous or heterologous libraries. indeed, this reveals potential conservation of the interaction between the gli transcription factors and their putative gbs among vertebrates. multi-species conservation of the identified sequences was also addressed. the majority of the assayed genes showed low percentage of mice-rat-human similarity or murine only conservation. some genes like neo <dig> showed a high percentage of conservation in mice-rat-human comparisons, while others like sfrp <dig> did not show any conservation, probably due to the partial presence of repeating elements. some of these sequences, though, also show predicted repeating elements, which might account for the absence of conservation observed in the multiple alignments.

target gene expression
further experiments using the hh-responsive cell line c3h10t1/ <dig> confirmed the results obtained from our screening, showing positive correlations of expression level loss to pharmacological loss of function of the hh/gli pathway. interestingly, though, none of our chosen genes show an "early response" to cyc treatments, with reduced mrna levels coming after  <dig> hours of treatment like ptc <dig>  instead they displayed a slower response to pathway inhibition, where expression is significantly reduced only after  <dig> hours of treatment. similarly,  <dig> hours pur treatment showed a rather modest increase in target genes, such as neo <dig> and c-myc, in comparison to the well known described ptc <dig> up-regulation. this may suggest different levels of regulation, possibly due to the different genomic and regulatory contexts of the given promoters causing a different response dynamic than ptc <dig>  indeed, it has been reported that the expression of some hh target genes depends on pathway activation , whereas other targets must be expressed prior to the induction of gli activators, which then have their expression increased via positive feedback . thus, it will be interesting to discover possible similarities and differences in the transcription of different types of hh target genes.

our results clearly indicate the necessity for functionally testing individual genes and associated networks resulting from bioinformatics analysis. that some of the selected targets do not show increased mrna levels when cells are treated with the pur agonist  is likely due to additional signals regulating gene expression. gain-of-function provides extra information on the mechanisms of gli-mediated transcription of these target genes when compared to loss-of-function treatments. the fact that seven out of eight of the chosen genes show reduced mrna after cyc treatment highlights the degree of accuracy that our screen assay provides for identifying target genes and corroborates our selection criteria.

a major finding of this study is the identification of several novel shh target genes that we show to be important for embryonic development in-vivo. the use of zebrafish embryos as an in-vivo model to validate target genes has been previously reported  <cit> , and our ish provided a spatial-temporal resolution to changes observed at the transcript level in cell culture. here we tested three candidate genes, selected based on their involvement in different processes during development. sfrp <dig> is involved in myoblast differentiation  <cit> . c-myc is involved in the cell cycle and critically regulates cell proliferation  <cit> . neo <dig> has been related to axon migration and more recently to neural progenitor proliferation in the cns  <cit> . the shh pathway has been classically implicated in both myogenesis and neurogenesis. indeed, shh loss of function in early development generates severe alterations in slow muscle development  <cit> . patterning of the dorsal/ventral axis, specification of neuronal and oligodendroglial cell types, and proliferation of dorsal brain structures like the cerebellum, optic tectum and the neocortex also rely on shh signaling  <cit> . in addition to the key functions of shh in cns development, is also implicated in oncogenesis. shh signaling is deregulated in medulloblastomas , embryonic tumors composed of primitive-appearing cells that arise in the cerebellum. interestingly, a recent survey of the methylation status of tumor suppressors or oncogenes in human mbs has revealed among several epigenetic silencers sfrp family members  <cit> .

all chosen candidate genes evaluated in the zebrafish embryo showed altered expression consistent with the in-vitro data obtained from c3h10t1/ <dig>  their response in-vivo in the zebrafish embryo was a very context dependent response, with expression showing variation in some structures while remaining unaltered in others. not all expression was ablated in smu mutants, however, so this might pertain to additional signals that could be regulating expression in a context-dependent manner in the zebrafish embryo. all three gli family members have been shown to recognize the same gbs and share redundant functions. however, our data clearly show functional differences between gli <dig> and gli <dig> members, as evidenced by the zebrafish mutant analysis. thus it is of great interest to further investigate the specific functions of each gli transcription factor, sorting out their distinct and overlapping roles upon targets.

CONCLUSIONS
our study uncovered target genes previously linked to shh signaling and, most importantly, previously unknown genes likely to play important roles during embryonic development. several new candidates, including positive controls, whose modulation by shh/gli has been reported, were analyzed in the context of zebrafish development. these findings extend our knowledge of the shh regulatory pathway function in development. attaining a thorough understanding of hh signaling is of vital importance for developing a mechanistic understanding of congenital abnormalities and diseases.
