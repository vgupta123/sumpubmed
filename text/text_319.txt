BACKGROUND
legumes are important sources of proteins for human food and animal feed. in addition, legumes improve soil fertility and decrease the need for n fertilizers through symbiotic interactions with nitrogen fixing bacteria and thus contribute to the sustainability of agriculture  <cit> . field pea, pisum sativum, is a legume crop that is grown on over  <dig> million acres worldwide and in europe dry pea production is the highest within legume production. the main threat to pea yields are diseases, including aphanomyces euteiches  <cit>  that causes seedling damping off and root rot disease of many legumes. it is considered as the most devastating pea pathogen, causing up to 80 % losses each year  <cit> . it is widespread in north america, europe, japan, australia and new zealand  <cit> . phytophthora pisi is a recently described species, which causes root rot on pea and faba bean , and is capable of infecting certain other legumes closely related to these crops  <cit> . as an emerging pathogen, it represents a potential threat for pea cultivation.

both these pathogens are oomycetes, which belong to the kingdom stramenopila and are evolutionary related to brown algae. in the asexual stage bi-flagellated motile zoospores are released in the soil, swim chemotactically towards the plant roots, encyst at the root surface, germinate and subsequently infect the host roots. in the sexual cycle, thick-wall oospores are formed that survive in the soil for many years as the primary source of inoculum. efficient chemical control of the pea root rot diseases caused by a. euteiches and p. pisi is not available and crop rotation and other cultural practices remain the only solutions to avoid the disease. although the use of resistant pea varieties would be the most economical and ecological strategy to control the disease, no resistant variety to either pathogen is commercially available so far.

pisum sativum has a large and complex genome and currently few comprehensive genomic resources exist. the lack of a sequenced genome is a limiting factor for molecular and –omics approaches for research on this plant  <cit> . however, the advantage of knowledge and tools available for the legume model species medicago truncatula are used for research on pea  since high level of genetic homology and synteny between these two species are reported  <cit> . a m. truncatula microarray was recently used successfully to study the transcriptomic response of pea during infection by mycosphaerella pinodes  <cit> .

our present understanding of the early molecular interactions between a. euteiches or p. pisi and pea are very limited. plant-pathogen interaction is viewed as a multi-layered process, where in the first layer of the defence system plants can recognize conserved microbe- or pathogen-associated molecular patterns  and initiate pattern-triggered immunity   <cit> . specialized pathogens secrete proteins called effectors that suppress pti and result in effector-triggered susceptibility . subsequently, certain plants recognize particular effectors, or their activity, by resistance  proteins, which lead to activation of the second layer of defence, effector-triggered immunity   <cit> . eti is stronger in amplitude than pti and can involve the same or different signalling sectors than pti, but both layers involve massive changes of gene activity and extensive reprogramming of the cell metabolism.

for a successful defence the activation of plant responses must be rapid, efficient and targeted. it is shown that the signalling sectors defined by the phytohormones salicylic acid , jasmonic acid  and ethylene  are important in plant immunity  <cit> . sa is generally involved in immunity against biotrophic and hemi-biotrophic pathogens, while the ja and et sectors are involved in immunity against necrotrophic pathogens and herbivorous insects. other phytohormones such as abscisic acid, auxin and gibberellins are also involved in plant immune signalling  <cit> . in addition, a number of phenylpropanoid compounds with antimicrobial activity have been shown to restrict pathogen growth  <cit> . in legumes, flavonoid compounds that are crucial in the initiation of symbiotic interactions with rhizobia also play a role as defence compounds and as signalling molecules  <cit> .

aphanomyces spp. belongs to saprolegniales and includes numerous destructive plant and animal pathogens, whereas phytophthora spp. belongs to peronosporales and includes species only pathogenic to plants. this diversity within the oomycetes reflects different evolutionary histories and different mechanisms of infection between saprolegniales and peronosporales  <cit> . one major difference between aphanomyces and phytophthora is depicted in their effector repertoires, where phytophthora species contain a large spectrum of rxlr effectors while no rxlr genes are identified in the a. euteiches genome  <cit> . despite being distantly related species, a. euteiches and p. pisi have both evolved specific pathogenicity on pea as a common host. therefore, we hypothesize that a. euteiches and p. pisi manipulate the pti or eti defence signalling in pea in common and distinct ways depending on differences in their effector repertories, which subsequently leads to activation of common or distinct pea defence responses.

the aim of this project was to study the transcriptomic response of pea plants towards a. euteiches and p. pisi during the initial phase of infection, using heterologous probing on a m. truncatula microarray. we aim to identify differentially regulated genes during early infection, to make inferences about pea immune-related pathways that are commonly or specifically regulated during interaction with these two oomycetes pathogens.

RESULTS
infection process evaluation
the infection process of pea roots with a. euteiches and p. pisi was evaluated by analysing gene expression of selected defence marker genes such as aco , pi <dig> , aba <dig>  and chit <dig> , using reverse transcription quantitative pcr . relative expression of all genes increased with time during infection . expression of aco, aba <dig> and pi <dig> were significantly  induced during a. euteiches infection from 20 h post inoculation  and onwards, and at  <dig> hpi during p. pisi infection. infection samples at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi were selected to study the early global transcriptomic response of pea to a. euteiches and p. pisi, using microarray technology.

all  <dig> probe sequences  included on the microarray showed an analysable signal. applying the linear models for microarray data   <cit> ,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were identified as responsive to a. euteiches at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi, respectively, while  <dig> and  <dig> genes were found as responsive to p. pisi at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi, respectively  . these lists of responsive genes to each treatment were used for analysis of biochemical pathways in the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database. in order to focus the analysis on the genes with higher fold change expression compared to the control samples we considered a cut off  on the log <dig> ratio fold change expression treatment/control of the genes with p ≤  <dig> . therefore, genes with ≥  <dig>  fold induction and ≤  <dig>  fold suppression compared to control samples in the same time point were defined as differentially expressed genes. in response to a. euteiches,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were differentially expressed  at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi, respectively . in response to p. pisi,  <dig> and  <dig> sequences were differentially expressed  at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi, respectively, compared to the control samples at the same time point . all differentially expressed genes were associated with their respective gene ontology  terms and clustered based on their go terms. sixty-four percent of all differentially expressed genes were successfully associated with a go number and categorized across the three main go categories of biological process, cellular component and molecular function . the remaining 36 % represented sequences of currently unknown functions.table  <dig> number of genes related to each treatment in response to aphanomyces euteiches and phytophthora pisi at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi

distinct transcriptional plant responses are featured during the early phase of infections by p. pisi and a. euteiches
the overlap of differentially expressed genes in response to a. euteiches and p. pisi over time was determined . only a limited number of common genes were up regulated or down regulated in response to the two pathogens at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi. in contrast, large sets of genes were uniquely regulated in response to each pathogen and at each time point.

furthermore, hierarchical clustering was performed for genes differentially regulated in at least one interaction. four major clusters could be distinguished . clusters  <dig> and  <dig> represented genes mainly induced at  <dig> hpi in response to p. pisi and a. euteiches, respectively. clusters  <dig> and  <dig> included genes mainly induced at  <dig> hpi in response to a. euteiches and p. pisi, respectively. each cluster could be further divided into smaller sub-clusters containing genes with common regulatory patterns . sub-clusters 1b and 2a included genes induced in response to both pathogens at  <dig> hpi, while sub-clusters 1a and 2b included genes specifically induced in response to p. pisi and a. euteiches at  <dig> hpi, respectively. sub-clusters 3b and 4a included genes induced in response to both pathogens at  <dig> hpi, while sub-clusters 3a and 4b represented genes specifically induced at  <dig> hpi in response to a. euteiches and p. pisi, respectively .fig.  <dig> clustering of differentially expressed pea genes in response to a. euteiches and p. pisi. hierarchical clustering of all differentially expressed genes  at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi compared to the mock-inoculated control samples generated by hce <dig>  software with the complete linkage method and the manhattan distance measure. red and green represent up regulated and down regulated genes, respectively. four classes of genes were defined according to their expression profiles. cluster  <dig> and  <dig> corresponds to genes highly up regulated at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi in response to p. pisi , while cluster  <dig> and  <dig> corresponds to genes up regulated at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi in response to a. euteiches . each cluster was urther divided into smaller sub-clusters containing genes with common regulatory patterns. sub-clusters 1b and 2a included genes induced in response to both pathogens at  <dig> hpi, while sub-clusters 1a and 2b included genes specifically induced in response to p. pisi and a. euteiches at  <dig> hpi, respectively. sub-clusters 3b and 4a included genes induced in response to both pathogens at  <dig> hpi, while sub-clusters 3a and 4b represented genes specifically induced at  <dig> hpi in response to a. euteiches and p. pisi, respectively



the combined genes present in clusters  <dig> and  <dig> were significantly  enriched in five molecular functions and six cellular component go categories compared with the combined genes present in clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  the enriched molecular functions in clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  which are mainly those induced at  <dig> hpi, were associated with antioxidant activity , peroxidase activity  and peptidase activity  as well as cellular component ontologies associated with cell  and plant-type cell wall  . however, the combined genes present in clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  or any combination of sub-clusters, were not enriched in any functional categories.

phytophthora pisi and a. euteiches infections lead to disparate pathogen perception and signalling transcriptomic responses in pea
to investigate transcriptional changes in gene classes involved in pathogen perception and signalling, genes with go number associated with the signal transduction process  were identified. in total,  <dig> differentially regulated genes were found among all data sets. hierarchical clustering of genes associated with signal transduction showed four distinguished clusters, similar to those of all differentially expressed genes. the clusters represented genes uniquely induced in response to each pathogen at different time points and genes activated in common for both pathogens . cluster  <dig> represented a set of  <dig> genes that were induced at  <dig> hpi in response to both pathogens, but suppressed at  <dig> hpi. cluster  <dig> represented  <dig> genes that were significantly induced at  <dig> hpi in response to a. euteiches and cluster  <dig> represented genes induced at  <dig> hpi in response to p. pisi while cluster  <dig> includes the genes all specifically up-regulated in response to a. euteiches at  <dig> hpi . the overlap between differentially expressed genes associated with signal transduction in response to a. euteiches and p. pisi over time was determined . a majority of the genes were specifically up regulated or down regulated at each time points in response to each pathogen.fig.  <dig> differentially expressed pea immune signalling candidate genes. a hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes  that corresponds to pathogen perception and signalling during early time of interaction with a. euteiches and p. pisi. the clustering is generated by hce <dig>  software with the complete linkage method and the manhattan distance measure. red and green represent up regulated and down regulated genes, respectively. p <dig> and p <dig> correspond to infection by p. pisi at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, while a <dig> and a <dig> correspond to infection by a. euteiches at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, respectively. the overlap between  up regulated and  down regulated gene sets associated with immune signalling is shown



among the genes associated with signal transduction,  <dig> were identified as putative r-genes and receptor-like kinases  . hierarchical clustering of these genes revealed two clusters. cluster  <dig> represented genes induced at  <dig> hpi while suppressed at  <dig> hpi. cluster  <dig> included two subclasses in which subclass 2a represented genes that were suppressed at  <dig> hpi while induced at  <dig> hpi in response to both species while cluster 2b included genes that were specifically induced or suppressed at each time point responding to the pathogens . twelve and ten putative r- and rlks-genes were down regulated at both time points upon infection with a. euteiches and p. pisi, respectively, and may thus represent potential targets of defence-suppressing pathogen effectors.fig.  <dig> differentially expressed pea resistance genes. hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed pea nb-lrr and rlk genes  during early time of interaction with a. euteiches  and p. pisi . the clustering is generated in r software. yellow and red represent up regulated and down regulated genes, respectively



phytophthora pisi and a. euteiches infections result in differential expression of defence related genes in phenylpropanoid and hormonal pathways
downstream pea immune responses were investigated by mapping all genes to kegg pathways and by grouping genes into two sets previously reported to be involved in plant immune responses: the phenylpropanoid pathway and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and hormonal signalling.

phenylpropanoid pathway and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites
the gene ac148816_ <dig> , putatively encoding a shikimate o-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase  was induced  <dig>  fold at  <dig> hpi in response to p. pisi. five putative chalcone synthases , ac146575_ <dig> , ac146575_ <dig> , ac137823_ <dig> , ac146575_ <dig>  and ac146571_ <dig> ) involved in the early steps of flavonoid biosynthesis, were up regulated at  <dig> hpi in response to a. euteiches , but not induced in response to p. pisi. the putative isoflavone 7-o-methyltransferase  ac139852_ <dig> , which presumably methylates  <dig> -dihydroxyiso-flavone  and  <dig> ,4-trihydroxyisoflavone  to yield isoformononetin and prunetin, was suppressed  <dig> fold  at  <dig> hpi in response to a. euteiches .fig.  <dig> scheme of the phenylpropanoid pathway. the expression profiles of all pea genes, which are responsive to at least one treatment , involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway during early interaction with a. euteiches and p. pisi are shown in the tables in the figure. numbers in the coloured boxes represent the fold change  in expression. p <dig> and a <dig> correspond to fc at  <dig> hpi while p <dig> and a <dig> correspond to fc at  <dig> hpi in response to p. pisi and a. euteiches, respectively, compared to mock-inoculated control samples. asterisks indicate fc values that are differentially expressed . the heat map goes from blue to red with increasing expression values. arrows represent enzymatic reactions. the abbreviations marked in red indicate that at least one gene member of the family is differentially regulated at least in one treatment. abbreviations: phenylalanine ammonia-lyase , cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase , 4-coumarate-coa ligase , cinnamoyl-coa reductase , shikimate o-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase , caffeoyl-coa o-methyltransferase , cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase , chalcone synthase , naringin 3-dioxygenase , 2-hydroxyisoflavanone synthase , 2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase  and isoflavone o-methyltransferase 



genes involved in cell wall modifications were also differentially regulated. the gene cr931741_ <dig> , putatively encoding a cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase  that is responsible for the last enzymatic step in the monolignol biosynthesis, was induced  <dig>  fold at  <dig> hpi in response to both pathogens, while another member of this gene family, cr931741_ <dig>  was suppressed  <dig>  fold at  <dig> hpi in response to p. pisi . furthermore, two putative callose synthases  ac155803_ <dig>  and ac137603_ <dig> , were up regulated  <dig>  fold at  <dig> hpi in response to p. pisi and a. euteiches, respectively. however, at  <dig> hpi gsl ac155803_ <dig>  showed suppression by  <dig> fold in response to both pathogens . several putative pectin esterase  genes were differentially expressed; two different genes, ac174141_ <dig>  and ct009653_ <dig> , were induced  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold against a. euteiches at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, respectively, while three other genes were suppressed upon infection by p. pisi . the gene ac173289_ <dig> , encoding a putative pectin esterase inhibitor enzyme  predicted to prevent or reduce the activity of pectin esterases, was induced at  <dig> hpi  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold during interaction with a. euteiches and p. pisi, respectively .table  <dig> expression of pea genes involved in cell wall modifications

hormonal signalling
at  <dig> hpi the gene ac155803_ <dig> , putatively encoding a lipoxygenase  that is involved in the biosynthesis of ja, was suppressed by  <dig>  fold in response to both pathogens while two other members of this gene family, ac146571_ <dig>  and ay515253_ <dig> , were induced at  <dig> hpi in response to p. pisi and a. euteiches by  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold, respectively. two  and three  putative aco genes, involved in the final step of et production, were up regulated upon infection with p. pisi at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, respectively . in contrast, two other putative aco genes, ac169513_ <dig>  and ac169513_ <dig> , showed  <dig>  fold inductions in response to a. euteiches at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi, respectively. the ac145767_ <dig>  gene that is a putative ethylene-responsive transcription factor  gene, essential for et biosynthesis  <cit> , showed  <dig>  fold induction at  <dig> hpi against a. euteiches only. three putative auxin-induced saur family member genes , known to be rapidly and transiently up regulated in response to auxin  <cit> , were induced against a. euteiches at  <dig> hpi  but constitutively expressed against p. pisi .table  <dig> expression of pea genes involved in hormonal signalling pathways

numbers indicate fold change  ratios of expression levels of genes involved in hormonal signalling at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi in response to a. euteiches and p. pisi compared with mock inoculation. a6hpi and a20hpi correspond to the expression values in response to a. euteiches at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi, respectively, while p6hpi and p20hpi correspond to the expression values in response to p. pisi at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi, respectively. bold values indicate if the treatment fc is significantly  different from the control. bindicate if the fc expression levels are differentially expressed  



confirmation and investigation of differential gene expression by quantitative pcr
rt-qpcr was used to validate the microarray data and to assess the expression levels of seven selected candidate genes in pea during interaction with p. pisi and a. euteiches at  <dig> hpi,  <dig> hpi,  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi. the genes were chosen to include genes specifically induced, suppressed and non-regulated in response to a. euteiches, and to cover several different functional categories. the expression patterns observed by rt-qpcr were in agreement with those obtained by microarray at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi . the only exception was that the pea omt gene, which showed similarity  to the m. truncatula i7omt involved in methylation of daidzein and genistein, was down regulated at  <dig> hpi in response to a. euteiches according to the microarray experiment but up regulated at this time according to rt-qpcr . the expression pattern of the hmm <dig> gene, putatively encoding a 6a-hydroxymaackiain methyltransferase enzyme that catalyses the last step of the synthesis of the main pea phytoalexin pisatin, was investigated by rt-qpcr although no data was available for this gene in the microarray experiment. the result showed up-regulation of this gene against a. euteiches at  <dig> hpi compared to the control, followed by  <dig> fold induction at  <dig> hpi compared to  <dig> hpi .fig.  <dig> expression profiles of selected pea genes during interaction with a. euteiches and p. pisi. relative expression levels were normalized by β-tubulin  expression, and presented in relation to control pea plants at  <dig> hpi  using the 2-∆∆ct formula. error bars represent standard deviation based on at least  <dig> biological replicates. asterisks indicate statistically significant  differences between infection treatments and control plants within time points according to the fisher test. abbreviations: chalcone synthesis , peroxidase , nucleotide binding - leucine rich repeat resistance , callose synthase , lipoxygenase , 6a-hydroxymaackiain methyltransferase  and o-methyltransferase 



in response to a. euteiches, the putative chalcone synthase genes chs <dig> and chs <dig> were induced  <dig> fold compared to the control at  <dig> hpi , while they were constitutively expressed during p. pisi infection. the gsl <dig> gene, putatively encoding a callose synthase, was induced at  <dig> hpi specifically in interaction with p. pisi . the pod <dig> gene putatively encoding a peroxidase was specifically induced during the 2- <dig> hpi interaction with a. euteiches  while only induced at  <dig> hpi in response to p. pisi . the nb-lrr <dig> gene, putatively encoding a nucleotide binding-site leucine-rich repeat protein, was specifically suppressed by  <dig> hpi after a. euteiches infection and later during that interaction . the expression of the lox <dig> gene, putatively encoding a linoleate 13s-lipoxygenase, was up regulated early after infection with p. pisi  while constitutively expressed later during infection with both pathogens.

discussion
our previous characterization of the infection process of p. pisi on pea roots suggests that the infection process turns necrotrophic by  <dig> hpi  <cit> . however, haustorium formation in the prospective biotrophic phase is not reported in either a. euteiches or p. pisi. based on the significant gene expression induction of defence marker genes pi <dig>  aba <dig>  aco and chit <dig>  <cit>  at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, and the evaluation of the infection process in a previous study  <cit> , pea roots at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi were sampled for the transcriptomic analysis to represent early infection.

a number of reference genomes for legumes including m. truncatula, glycine max and phaseolus vulgaris are completed , but the genome of pea has not yet been sequenced and this limits the usefulness of deep sequencing approaches for transcriptomic investigations. an approach to study the transcriptional responses in species lacking genome sequence information is heterologous probing on microarrays based on closely related species, which is successfully used for pea by hybridization on a m. truncatula microarray  <cit> .

sources of bias and errors when using an heterologous probing approach to analyse gene expression patterns are i) the efficiency of the hybridizations and ii) variations in gene family structure and gene sequence between species  <cit> . therefore, it is important to validate results obtained with microarray, with an alternative approach such as rt-qpcr. the expression analyses of the pea omt and m. truncatula i7omt gene illustrates these problems; our microarray experiment showed that a gene similar to m. truncatula i7omt was suppressed in response to a. euteiches at  <dig> hpi but the results obtained by rt-qpcr for a predicted pea o-methyltransferase  transcript with high similarity to m. truncatula i7omt , obtained from a pea rna-seq assembly  <cit> , showed induction of this gene at  <dig> hpi. thus, the actual variation between the two i7omt/omt sequences, or potential variations in the omt gene family structure between the two species, interfered with the analysis. however the results of rt-qpcr for other target genes showed common expression pattern as in microarray, confirming the microarray analysis and indicating that the use of the m. truncatula microarray for studying the pea transcriptome is a reliable tool, as it was reported previously  <cit> .

in the current work, we study compatible interactions between pea and the two pathogens a. euteiches and p. pisi, which results in disease. we hypothesise that in these compatible interactions the transcriptomic responses in pea are linked with immunity, and thus represent a failed defence response. however, there are examples of susceptibility genes in pea. the psmlo <dig> gene, coding for a plant specific membrane protein with as yet unknown function, is an example of a susceptibility gene in pea against powdery mildew caused by erysiphe pisi  <cit> . no susceptibility genes associated with a. euteiches or p. pisi are as yet identified in pea.

comparison between time points for each pathogen and interspecies infection revealed distinct sets of differentially regulated genes in response to a. euteiches and p. pisi and at each time point. this indicates that the different pathogenicity mechanisms of a. euteiches or p. pisi lead to disparate transcriptional changes in pea. this interpretation is strengthened by the expression patterns of genes involved in pathogen perception and signalling where different sets of genes are specifically differentially regulated in response to each pathogen, indicating that different signalling molecules in pea are triggered by these two oomycetes.

furthermore, the induction and suppression of genes associated with signal transduction pathways at  <dig> hpi in response to both pathogens suggest that immunity responses associated with pti or eti occurs early in infection. interestingly, many genes encoding nb-lrrs are suppressed early after infection, indicating that these oomycetes secrete and deliver their effectors into the pea root cells early during infection to suppress immune signalling leading to ets. this idea is in line with the transcriptomic analysis of p. capsici-tomato interaction, where a subset of pathogen effectors and host receptor genes were induced and repressed, respectively, during biotrophy  <cit> . furthermore, the data indicates that some nb-lrr and lrr-rlk encoding genes in pea are triggered commonly against both pathogens while some are specifically activated at each time point responding to each of these oomycetes.

transcriptional changes suggesting increased cell wall reinforcement are observed in response to both pathogens. cell wall reinforcement contributes to the development of physical barriers through deposition of cell wall appositions at sites of pathogen detection as a common component of the pti response  <cit> . gsl genes of higher plants encode essential proteins for callose formation  <cit> . therefore, induction of pea putative gsl genes early after infection against these oomycetes suggests the formation of callose at the infection site as a part of the defence mechanism. this is in agreement with a study where callose deposition was shown as a defence mechanism to restrict p. capsici growth at early time in an incompatible interaction with arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . induction of a putative cad gene, involved in lignification, suggests that lignin deposition in the cell walls is part of the defence mechanism against both a. euteiches and p. pisi. this result is consistent with a study where lignin deposition in cell walls is shown to be a striking feature of m. truncatula partial resistance against a. euteiches  <cit> .

based on the expression pattern of the putative lox genes in response to p. pisi and a. euteiches, it appears that ja biosynthesis is down regulated at  <dig> hpi and activated at  <dig> hpi. a crucial role of lox compounds in resistance of tobacco in an incompatible interaction with p. parasitica was shown  <cit> . furthermore, an increase in susceptibility of ja-deficient mutant tomato  plants to p. infestans has been reported  <cit> . therefore, considering the role of ja as an important mediator in defence signalling against these oomycetes, we hypothesize that p. pisi and a. euteiches suppress ja biosynthesis in pea during the early phases of susceptible interactions for favouring the infection. induction of ja pathway at  <dig> hpi in pea is in agreement with a recent study on soybean - p. sojae interaction where the ja pathway was up regulated at  <dig> hpi in the susceptible soybean lines  <cit> . on the other hand, induction of aco genes that is positively correlated with ethylene production rates  <cit>  suggests up regulation of et biosynthesis pathway in pea upon infection with both pathogens. while et and ja are often regarded to be part of the same signalling module, a negative regulatory relationship between components of these two pathways is reported  <cit> . furthermore, non-synergetic regulation of these two pathways is reported in compatible and incompatible soybean - p. sojae interactions at  <dig> hpi  <cit> . activation of the et pathway in response to a. euteiches is supported by induction of erf, which is the transcription factor essential in et signalling  <cit> .

in contrast to the similarities in the regulation of ja and et biosynthesis genes in pea during interactions with p. pisi and a. euteiches, induction of genes encoding auxin-induced saur family proteins appears to be specific to a. euteiches. the induction of saur family proteins may indicate an accumulation of auxin in roots during a. euteiches infection. auxin signalling is reported to be important in a. thaliana resistance against oomycetes such as pythium irregulare and hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis  <cit>  and repression of this pathway enhances the susceptibility of a. thaliana to p. cinnamomi  <cit> . recently, the polar auxin transport in roots was reported to be targeted by an rxlr effector of p. parasitica, the penetration-specific effector  <dig> , in compatible interactions with a. thaliana roots  <cit> , leading to modulation of the auxin content  locally at the root apex to favour infection. a possible interpretation of our data is that p. pisi, but not a. euteiches, possess effectors that target and suppress auxin accumulation in pea roots, thereby favouring infection.

induction of chs genes putatively encoding chalcone synthases also appears to be specific to infection by a. euteiches. naringenin chalcone that is the product of the chs reaction, is a substrate for the production of a wide range of secondary metabolites, including flavones, isoflavonoid phytoalexins, and anthocyanins. legumes utilize flavonoid compounds, notably isoflavones and isoflavanones in defence against pathogens and as signalling molecules  <cit> . induction of genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway, such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase , chs and isoflavone synthase, was shown to be rapid and strong in compatible interaction in soybean against p. sojae  <cit> . furthermore, induction of genes involved in this pathway was reported in m. truncatula in response to pathogen infection such as erysiphe pisi and colletotrichum trifolii . taken together, the induction of chs genes during infection by a. euteiches suggests that biosynthesis of secondary metabolites e.g. isoflavonoid phytoalexins, is a part of plant immunity response to this pathogen.

local resistance of pea root tips against a. euteiches is previously reported to be associated with an increase in pisatin production in the border cells  <cit> , and silencing of hmm <dig> results in reduced pisatin production  <cit> . induction of pea hmm <dig> in response to a. euteiches suggests that pisatin synthesis might be part of the defence response against this pathogen.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that different gene sets are triggered in pea by a. euteiches and p. pisi, leading to distinct and common transcriptional responses during the early phase of susceptible interaction with these two distantly related oomycetes. cell wall reinforcement and modulation of ja and et pathways are similar in response to both pathogens, while induction of the auxin pathway and chalcone synthesis is specific response to a. euteiches . taken together, this knowledge will lead to a better understanding of the early defence response in pea against these important pathogens. future advances in our understanding of oomycete infection mechanisms will explain more of the distinct patterns we observe.fig.  <dig> differentially regulated defense sectors in pea. summary of defense-related transcriptional differences in pea during compatible interactions with aphanomyces euteiches and phytophthora pisi at  <dig> hpi  and  <dig> hpi . abbreviations: ethylene pathway , salicylic acid pathway , auxin pathway , jasmonic acid pathway
