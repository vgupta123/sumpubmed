BACKGROUND
nonribosomal peptide synthetases  are multimodular megasynthases which catalyze biosynthesis of small bioactive peptides  via a thiotemplate mechanism independent of ribosomes  <cit> . nrps encoding genes  are plentiful in fungi and bacteria but are not known in plants or animals. the enzymes they encode biosynthesize a staggering diversity of chemical products because their substrates can include both d and l forms of the  <dig> amino acids used in ribosomal protein synthesis, as well as non-proteinogenic amino acids such as ornithine, imino acids, and hydroxy acids such as α-aminoadipic and α-butyric acids  <cit> . the natural functions of most nrps for producing organisms are largely unknown, although recently it has become clearer that they play fundamental roles in fungal reproductive and pathogenic development, morphology, cell surface properties, stress management, and nutrient procurement  <cit>  in addition to better-known roles as toxins/mycotoxins involved in plant or animal pathogenesis or as life-saving pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics, immunosuppressants, and anticancer agents.

nrpss use a set of core domains, known as a module, to accomplish peptide synthesis. a minimal module consists of three core domains: an adenylation  domain which recognizes and activates the substrate via adenylation with atp, a thiolation  or peptidyl carrier protein  domain which binds the activated substrate to a 4'-phosphopantetheine  cofactor via a thioester bond and transfers the substrate to a condensation  domain which catalyzes peptide bond formation between adjacent substrates on the megasynthase complex  <cit> . several specialized c-terminal domains involved in chain termination and release of the final peptide product have also been identified  <cit> . in bacteria, chain release is most commonly effected by a thioesterase  domain  <cit> , which releases the peptide by either hydrolysis or internal cyclization  <cit> . in fungi, only a few nrpss, such as the acv synthetases, are known to release products via a te domain and chain release is carried out by a variety of mechanisms, two of which predominate and occur less frequently in bacterial systems: 1) a terminal c domain, which catalyzes release by inter- or intra-molecular amide bond formation  <cit> , and 2) a thioesterase nadp dependent reductase  domain  <cit> , which catalyzes reduction with nadph to form an aldehyde. an additional mechanism, which has been reported only in biosynthesis of fungal ergot alkaloids, involves nonenzymatic cyclization by formation of a diketopiperazine ring  <cit> .

nrpss may contain additional modifying domains which alter the substrate during nrps biosynthesis: 1) an epimerization  domain which catalyzes epimerization of an amino acid from the l to the d configuration  <cit> , 2) an n-methylation  domain  which catalyzes transfer of a methyl group from an s-adenosylmethionine to an α-amino of the amino acid substrate, and 3) a specialized c domain termed a cyclization  domain which catalyzes formation of oxazoline or thiazoline rings by internal cyclization of cysteine, serine, or threonine residues  <cit> . additional tailoring enzymes which are not part of the nrps may modify either the substrate or the final peptide product by glycosylation, hydroxylation, acylation, or halogenation  <cit> .

nrpss may be monomodular, consisting of a single a-t-c module, or multimodular, consisting of repeated a-t-c modules. the suite of  <dig> nrpss found in the genome of the dothideomycete cochliobolus heterostrophus is representative of the diversity of nps genes in filamentous ascomycetes in that it contains a representative from most currently recognized groups of fungal nrpss  <cit> , and, with the exception of duplicated copies of chnps <dig>  the modular domain architectures of each encoded enzyme are distinct . in addition to mono- and multi-modular npss, a hybrid gene  encoding an incomplete nrps module  fused to a polyketide synthase  unit is present  <cit> . hybrid pks;nrps synthetases , the reverse organization of chnps7;pks <dig>  are more common in filamentous fungi as well as in bacteria  <cit> , although c. heterostrophus lacks a representative. pkss, found in fungi, bacteria, and plants are large megasynthases, related to fatty acid synthases, that biosynthesize small molecule polyketides with as diverse natural functions as nrps metabolites.

the evolutionary mechanisms giving rise to genes encoding enzymes with such diverse modular architectures are clearly complex. likely mechanisms include: 1) tandem duplication and loss of individual modules or domains, 2) gene fusion/fission, and 3) recombination and/or gene conversion of individual modules or domains either within the same nps or between different npss. it has been suggested that genes involved in secondary metabolite  biosynthesis tend to be located in subtelomeric regions, a factor which may contribute to their rapid evolution by the aforementioned mechanisms  <cit> .

npss are generally recognized as a rapidly evolving gene class in fungi leading to few clearly identifiable orthologs between species and highly discontinuous distributions  <cit> . however, as has been observed for members of other eukaryotic gene families , within each family, conservation and rates of gene duplication and loss are likely to vary among subgroups of genes encoding proteins of different function. in fact, some c. heterostrophus npss , are conserved or moderately conserved across euascomycote fungi  <cit>  and their nrp products are involved in basic cellular functions such as growth and development, reproduction, and pathogenesis  <cit> . the majority of npss, however, are highly discontinuously distributed across fungal taxa and even closely related species may share only a few homologs. some, e.g., cochliobolus carbonum hts <dig>  the gene encoding the nrps for biosynthesis of hc-toxin  <cit> , and alternaria alternata apple pathotype amt, the gene encoding the nrps for biosynthesis of am-toxin  <cit> , appear unique even to one race or pathotype within a single species. these lineage-specific synthetases tend to have more specialized, niche-specific functions.

higher rates of gene duplication and loss may reflect an adaptive response to selective pressure from pathogens, interactions with other organisms, or other environmental pressures. recent work suggests that, in fungi, genes involved in responses to stress are more likely to undergo duplication and loss than growth related genes  <cit> . thus, we hypothesize that nrpss with conserved functions involved in growth and development will show less variation in gene copy number and maintain a relatively conserved domain architecture in comparison with nrpss with more niche-specific functions.

the multimodular structure of nrpss and the complex mechanisms by which they evolve present challenges to phylogenetic analysis and consequently little work has been done to characterize phylogenetic relationships across this large class of megasynthases or to ask whether subclasses of common function can be identified, based on close relationships with nrpss whose chemical products are known. in this study, we undertook phylogenomic analyses on a comprehensive dataset of fungal nrps proteins to: 1) identify major subfamilies, 2) analyze patterns of distribution of these major subfamilies across fungal taxonomic groups, 3) understand relationships among selected bacterial nrpss, fungal monomodular nrps/nrps-like proteins, fungal multimodular nrpss, and related adenylating enzymes, including α-aminoadipate reductases involved in lysine biosynthesis in fungi, 4) consider mechanisms of evolution of multimodular nrpss, and 5) analyze patterns of nrps gene and a domain duplication and loss across fungi.

RESULTS
identification and domain structure of candidate nrpss
candidate nrpss extracted from each sequenced genome are listed in additional file  <dig>  genus and species abbreviations for all organisms mentioned in this study are shown in additional file  <dig>  the proposed domain structure for each nrps, based on searches with our fungal-specific hmmer models  and the pfam and interpro databases, is shown in additional file  <dig>  the majority of multimodular nrpss were composed of one or more standard nrps modules  with or without modifying domains , while most monomodular nrpss lacked complete a-t-c modules and consisted of a single a domain or an a-t unit followed by a variety of c-terminal domains, several of which have not previously been identified as core nrps domains .

phylogenomic analysis and subfamily identification
all known nrps/nrps-like proteins formed a monophyletic group supported by greater than 90% bootstrap support in ml analyses and greater than 50% bootstrap support in the nj analysis , separating them from most other known adenylating enzymes selected as potential outgroups, e.g., acyl amp ligases , cps <dig>  <cit> , long chain fatty acid ligases , acetyl-coa synthetases , and ochratoxin synthetases . the α-aminoadipate reductases , homologs of s. cerevisiae lys <dig>  <cit> , grouped within this well-supported clade of nrps/nrps-like proteins rather than with the other adenylating enzymes , suggesting that aars are more closely related to nrpss than to other adenylating enzymes.

the tree topologies resulting from phylogenetic analyses of individual a domains revealed two major groups of fungal nrpss . the first group  consists of primarily mono- or bi-modular fungal nrpss which group with bacterial nrps a domains. exceptions to the predominately mono/bi-modular fungal nrps structures include the acv synthetases and the clade containing a domains from the eleven modules of sima   <cit>  and from several related fungal nrpss. the other large group contains exclusively fungal and primarily multimodular nrpss and includes siderophore synthetases and a group we term the euascomycete-only synthetases, as its members are restricted to euascomycetes. both grouped together with greater than 97% bootstrap support in analyses of a reduced dataset which included selected representatives from each subfamily .

phylogenetic analyses identified nine major subfamilies of fungal nrpss. subfamilies were defined as the most internal branch from the root node that formed a monophyletic group which was supported by greater than >70% bootstrap support, shared identical taxon composition across all three phylogenetic methods, and contained a representative fungal nrps. these groups were named after a representative c. heterostrophus or other fungal nrpss of well-known function in the group . subfamilies include: 1) fungal pks;nrps hybrids, 2) chnps11/etp toxin module  <dig> synthetases, chnps12-like/etp module  <dig> toxin-like synthetases, 4) chnps10-like synthetases, 5) cyclosporin synthetases , 6) α-aminoadipate reductases , 7) acv synthetases , 8) siderophore synthetases , and 9) the euascomycete-only synthetases . deep phylogenetic relationships among mono/bi-modular subfamilies were unresolved and lacked bootstrap support . a domains from a few ascomycete  and several urediniomycete  proteins did not group with any of the major subfamilies and were not placed consistently in the trees when assessed by different phylogenetic methods. homologs of bimodular a. fumigatus side, a putative siderophore synthetase  <cit> , formed two clades corresponding to each module and consistently grouped with the sid subfamily but without bootstrap support in the larger phylogeny and with low bootstrap support  in the reduced phylogeny. we term this group side but do not consider them as a major subfamily 

relationships between fungal and bacterial nrpss: horizontal transfer or vertical transmission and massive loss?
the majority of bacterial sequences , identified as top hits in blast searches using a representative from each of the major fungal nrps subfamilies to query the public databases, were eubacterial in origin and formed a monophyletic group , which we term the major bacterial clade . this clade contains two fungal representatives suspected of being horizontally transmitted from bacteria to fungi. one is the fungal chnps7;pks <dig> hybrid nrps;pks synthetase which is nested within this clade; previous independent analyses of both the nrps  <cit>  and the pks portion of this protein  <cit>  found the same placement . the other is the acv synthetases, a group postulated to have been horizontally transferred from bacteria to fungi  <cit> , which groups as sister to, or within, the major bacterial clade . our analysis also shows that each of the three fungal acv synthetase a domains groups with the corresponding bacterial a domain rather than forming separate clades of fungal and bacterial a domains. these results support previous claims of horizontal transfer based on observations of closer sequence similarity than expected between these fungal and bacterial genes  <cit>  .

in contrast, bacterial siderophore synthetases , yersiniabactin , and pyochelin ) group separately from fungal nrpss  that biosynthesize intracellular siderophores and fungal nrpss  in the eas subfamily that biosynthesize extracellular siderophores . this suggests that fungal and bacterial capacities to chelate iron via small molecule siderophores have evolved independently .

the remaining bacterial a domains included in this study that grouped with high bootstrap support with fungal a domains were associated with the chnps12-like/etp module  <dig> and aar subfamilies . bacterial representatives of the former included representatives from the gammaproteobacterium  and two closely related species of actinobacteria ; of the latter, all are closely related species of pseudomonads. in the two cases of proposed horizontal transfer discussed above , the fungal genes are nested within a large clade of bacterial sequences. the reverse phylogenetic situation is observed for bacterial genes grouping with the aar and chnps <dig> subfamilies as, in these cases, bacterial nrpss, are nested within a large clade of fungal nrpss  or group as sister to fungal nrpss . these placements suggest that either the fungal genes were transferred to bacteria or that the origin of these groups predates the divergence of eukaryotes and prokaryotes and the observed pattern reflects extensive loss or incomplete sampling from bacteria. clearly, further sampling of bacterial sequences is needed to adequately address these hypotheses, but we favor the theory that these nrps subfamilies may have originated prior to the divergence of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. we hypothesize that the lack of phylogenetic signal for resolving relationships among the fungal mono/bi-modular subfamilies may in part reflect an ancient and rapid radiation of these groups.

distribution of nrps subfamilies across fungal taxonomic groups
the distribution of fungal nrps subfamilies across the major fungal taxonomic groups supports previous findings that nrpss are much more abundant in euascomycetes than in basidiomycetes and are scarce in chytridiomycota, zygomycota, schizosaccharomycota, and hemiascomycota  <cit> . the number and distribution of nrpss in each subfamily are shown in table  <dig>  eas and pks;nrps subfamilies were significantly overrepresented in euascomycete taxa when evaluated by fisher's exact tests, while chnps12-like synthetases were statistically overrepresented in basidiomycete taxa . the chytridiomycota, zygomycota, schizosaccharomycota, and hemiascomycota contained only a few nrpss. all zygomycota and hemiascomycota lacked genes encoding nrps-type proteins other than a single aar. the chytrid genome contained two additional nrps-like proteins grouping with the chnps12/etp module  <dig> subfamily, and the two schizosaccharomycota taxa examined contained one additional nrps for siderophore biosynthesis . no subfamilies were statistically overrepresented in these groups.

abased on inclusion in clades of phylogenetically defined subfamilies .

bseveral proteins which grouped with nrpss did not group with any of the  <dig> major subfamilies. these include homologs of side  in a. fumigatus and p. anserina species , several proteins in the urediniomycetes u. maydis, s. roseus, and p. graminis , two proteins in m. oryzae , and one in b. cinerea .

ca. fumigatus has two bi-modular nrpss  as does t. reesii . the first modules of all four nrpss group with the chnps11/etp module  <dig> subfamily; the second modules group with the nps <dig> subfamily. for tallying purposes, afu_6g <dig>  afu_6g <dig>  trire2_ <dig>  and trire2_ <dig> were attributed to the chnps11/etp module  <dig> subfamily.

dchnps <dig> and chnps <dig> modules  <dig> and  <dig> group with the eas subfamily, while chnps <dig> module  <dig> and chnps <dig> modules  <dig> and  <dig> group with the cyclo subfamily. for tallying purposes, chnps <dig> and chnps <dig> were attributed to the cyclo subfamily. similarly, mgg <dig>  and an <dig> also have some a domains in the cyclo subfamily and others in the eas subfamily. for tallying purposes, these genes were included in the cyclo subfamily.

eb. cinerea contains  <dig> pks;nrps hybrids. for one of these , the a domain did not align well and was missing several core motifs. this protein was removed from the final phylogenetic analysis.

* pks:nrps and eas subfamilies in euascomycetes and the nps12/etp module  <dig> subfamily in basidiomycetes are statistically over-represented.

lineage specific expansions and contractions
when patterns of gene duplication and loss were analyzed for the total number of nrpss/genome  over the tree of fungi , a highly significant expansion was found on the branch leading to euascomycetes . significant expansions were also found within euascomycetes on the branches leading to the aspergillus species , to f. graminearum  and to m. oryzae . n. crassa showed a highly significant  contraction in total number of nrps genes , likely due to the efficiency of rip and/or other genome defense mechanisms, that reduce the rate of fixation of duplicates  <cit> .

our data support previous findings  <cit> , including our own  <cit> , that unicellular fungi have few, if any, genes for secondary metabolism . ancestral reconstructions show that in hemiascomycete yeasts, this is due to loss of all nrpss, except for a single aar encoding gene, that were present in basidiomycetes and inferred to be present in the ancestor of ascomycetes . however, both the fission yeast s. pombe and the unicellular basidiomycete yeast sporobolomyces roseus contain one additional gene encoding a nrps  in additional to the single aar encoding gene, suggesting that a unicellular habit may not preclude the existence of secondary metabolite genes such as nrpss. patterns of expansion and contraction also do not seem to occur preferentially in fungal pathogens versus nonpathogens. while a number of pathogenic fungi  do show evidence for expansions in numbers of nrps, we also see expansion in the nonpathogen, a. nidulans.

subfamily distribution
aar
a single ortholog of s. cerevisiae lys <dig>  the aar involved in reduction of α-aminoadipic acid in the fungal lysine biosynthetic pathway  <cit> , was found in all fungi surveyed except the microsporidian, enchephalitozoon cuniculi, an intracellular parasite which has lost the majority of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis  <cit>  and the heterokaryotic basidiomycete postia placenta, which contains two .

chnps11/etp/chnps12
in a phylogeny of a reduced set of representative a domains from each subfamily , homologs of chnps <dig>  chnps <dig>  and the etp toxin synthetases, glip for gliotoxin and sirp for sirodesmin production, group together with strong bootstrap support , suggesting all share a common evolutionary origin. in the larger phylogeny of the complete dataset , they formed two separate clades each supported by >70% bootstrap support, but lacked this level of support for the entire group. the first clade  includes the first module of the etp toxin synthetases and monomodular chnps <dig>  the second module of the etp toxin synthetases, however, groups within a larger clade containing the two nrpss from the chytrid genome, several eubacterial nrpss, and a clade containing both euascomycete and basidiomycete homologs of chnps <dig> . while fungal nrpss associated with chnps <dig> and etp toxin synthetases are found only in euascomycota, nrpss from both eubacteria and from the most basal fungal group, chytridiomycota, were nested within this larger clade with high bootstrap support  .

chnps <dig>  cyclo, sid
three subfamilies, monomodular chnps <dig>  nrpss grouping with sima , and nrpss  involved in intracellular  siderophore biosynthesis, contain representatives from both basidiomycota and euascomycota. while all euascomycetes and many basidiomycetes examined contain at least one representative from the sid subfamily   <cit> , chnps <dig> and cyclo are more discontinuously distributed and a representative is not found in all taxa .

acv and pks;nrps
pks;nrpss were restricted to and statistically overrepresented in euascomycetes. as has been noted previously  <cit> , all fungal pks;nrps hybrids fall into a single, well supported, monophyletic group, which suggests a single origin . however, not all ascomycetes have a representative of this group and the number of corresponding genes varies widely among taxa . c. heterostrophus, for example, lacks a representative but m. oryzae has six. while acv synthetases are found in both bacteria and fungi, within fungi, they appear restricted to eurotiomycete and hypocrealean taxa. this study did not identify any additional acv synthetases in fungi apart from the known ones in penicillium chrysogenum, aspergillus nidulans, and cephalosporium acremonium , supporting previous conclusions that their distribution is likely the product of one or more isolated horizontal transfer events  <cit> .

euascomycete only 
the eas subfamily contains by far the greatest number of nrpss and is both restricted to and statistically overrepresented in euascomycetes .

hypothesized origins based on taxonomic distribution
fig.  <dig> shows the hypothesized origins of each subfamily based on taxonomic distribution of the oldest member of each group. by this criterion, the presence of bacterial sequences grouping within the chnps11/etp module  <dig> and chnps12/etp module  <dig> clades suggests that the origins of these groups may predate the divergence of eubacteria and eukaryotes . the aar subfamily must have arisen also either prior to or very early in the origin of the fungi as a representative is present in all fungi, including the most basal group, the chytridiomycota . since the sid, cyclo, and chnps <dig> subfamilies all contain representatives from both euascomycota and basidiomycota, these groups must have evolved prior to the divergence of the dikarya . the eas, pks;nrps, and acv synthetases contained only euascomycete representatives. both pks;nrps and eas may thus have originated in the ancestor of euascomycetes . as discussed above, the grouping of fungal acv synthetase a domains with the corresponding a domains of bacterial acv synthetases within a large clade of bacterial sequences provides evidence for horizontal transfer and suggests that this group originated within prokaryotes .

thus, taxonomic distributions suggest a more ancient origin of one or more of the mono/bi-modular nrps subfamilies , possibly predating the divergence of eubacteria and fungi . the strongly supported co-grouping of fungal and bacterial sequences in the chnps11/etp/chnps <dig> group, as in the outgroup adenylating enzymes  suggests this is a tenable hypothesis. acv is a special case and likely the result of horizontal transfer from bacteria to fungi. in contrast, the fungal-specific multimodular groups , which group together with high bootstrap support in the reduced phylogeny , appear to be of more recent origin and are restricted to and highly expanded in fungi.

mono- and bi- modular nrps subfamilies
unlike many of the multimodular nrpss, most monomodular subfamilies lack a complete nrps module  and consist of a single a domain or an a-t domain combination followed by a variety of c-terminal domains . many of the mono/bi-modular groups show a conserved domain architecture across all members in a subfamily, suggesting their domain architectures may be functionally constrained. available functional data suggest that the nrp products of several of these groups may play more central roles in cellular metabolism related to responses to oxidative stress and growth and development.

whether monomodular nrpss may act alone or in concert with non-nrps proteins is currently unknown. however, in bacterial systems, both single a domains as well as a-t domain units, known as initiation modules, can interact with other nrps proteins and accomplish biosynthesis by first activating and then transfering the activated substrate either to a c domain in the same nrps or to a c domain in a different nrps   <cit> .

aars and lysine biosynthesis
aars are conserved not only taxonomically but also in terms of domain structure. all have an identical structure consisting of an a-t unit followed by a thioester reductase  domain , a member of the nad-binding rossman fold domain superfamily . there are two primary pathways for lysine biosynthesis, the diaminopimelic acid pathway , found predominantly in bacteria and plants, and the α-aminoadipate pathway , found primarily in fungi and a few bacteria  <cit> . as noted above, aars catalyze reduction of α-aminoadipic acid in the aaa pathway  <cit> . the fact that aars have a c-terminal r domain in common with several other nrps subfamilies  supports our conclusions based on phylogenetic relationships that aars are more closely related to nrpss than other adenylating enzymes .

bacterial sequences grouping with fungal aar are comprised of a single a domain followed by an acyl-transferase domain  but lack the c-terminal r domain found in fungal aars. we conclude that they are likely not involved in lysine biosynthesis in bacteria. although there is evidence for the existence of lysine biosynthesis through the aaa pathway in some prokaryotes  <cit> , current data suggests that these pathways do not include a step involving reduction of α-aminoadipic acid  <cit> . thus, our data support previous conclusions that aars are fungal-specific enzymes  <cit> .

pks;nrps
nearly all fungal pks;nrps hybrids have the same domain structure  . the terminal r domain has been reported previously in several pks;nrps hybrids  <cit> .

chnps10
the chnps <dig> subfamily also has a conserved domain architecture across all genes in the subfamily, consisting of an a-t unit followed by two additional c-terminal domains. the first is a nad binding domain  also showing closest similarity to thioesterase reductase  domains and the second is a dehydrogenase domain with closest hits to adh short chain dehydrogenases  .

chnps11/etp/chnps12
the large and highly diverse clade of chnps11/etp/chnps <dig> homologs reveals the diversity of c-terminal domains that can follow a-t units and shows that, as for some bacterial nrpss, fungal nrps or nrps-like proteins can consist of single a domains .

at the base of this group are monomodular chnps <dig> and module  <dig> of the bimodular etp toxin synthetases, sirp and glip, which contain complete a-t-c modules . module  <dig> of sirp and glip groups at the base of the chnps12/etp module  <dig> clade. the second module of the etp toxin synthetases contains a complete module followed by an additional t domain  . this group also contains several fungal proteins with an incomplete  or a degenerate  first module .

nested within this clade is a group of bacterial nrpss with a single a domain and two nrps-like proteins from the chytrid b. dentrobatidis . one of the chytrid nrpss  has a t-c-t-a-t domain architecture followed by a domain with similarity to fsh <dig> , a serine hydrolase domain. the other chytrid protein  has an a-t unit followed by two additional domains. the first shows closest similarity to polynucleotidyl transferase, ribonuclease h fold , a domain associated with nucleic acid binding functions and found in a variety of proteins including hiv rnase h, transposases, and exonucleases  <cit>  . the second domain shows closest similarity to the membrane-associated domain lps-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha factor , which contains a characteristic cysteine rich zinc-binding motif found also in intracellular zn2+ binding proteins and animal transcription factors. the zinc and dna-binding domains found in the chytrid nrpss are intriguing . gliotoxin and sirodesmin pl have been shown to inhibit viral reverse transcriptase  <cit>  and general transcription  <cit> , respectively. in the case of sirodesmin pl, the addition of zinc and other iib series metals  both decreases toxin production in leptosphaeria maculans and also reverses the inhibition of transcription, suggesting interactions of sirodesmin pl with either cellular zinc or zinc-containing metalloenzymes such as rna polymerases  <cit> . whether these phenotypes relate to our identification of zn-binding domains in the corresponding chytrid nrps is unknown.

chnps <dig> , and its paralog  contain a single a domain followed by a domain showing closest similarity to a ferric reductase transmembrane domain . the closest homologs of chnps <dig>  are present in both euascomycete and basidiomycete group  <dig> and have the same domain structure as the c. heterostrophus nps <dig> proteins . sister to all group  <dig> nps12-like proteins is a group of proteins consisting of standalone a domains . these were found only in the brown-rot heterokaryotic fungus, p. placenta, which carries eight closely related copies.

the monomodular bacterial nrpss nested within the chnps12/etp module  <dig> subfamily also consist of a standalone a domains. as noted earlier, for many bacterial nrps systems , single a domains may be involved in nrps biosynthesis by activating and transferring the activated substrate to a different nrps  <cit> . only one example of this type of synthesis has been reported for fungi   <cit> , but our identification of these single fungal a domains grouping with other known nprss   suggests that this mechanism could be more common in fungi than previously appreciated.

the diversity of domain structures found within the chnps11/etp/chnps <dig> group leads us to hypothesize that there may be several distinct functional groups within this clade.

multimodular nrps subfamilies
the majority of multimodular nrpss are found in the sid and eas subfamilies. these subfamilies group together with high bootstrap support  in analyses of the reduced dataset . analyses that included a larger number of bacterial sequences  support our phylogenetic and distribution data that the sid and eas subfamilies are restricted to fungi. as noted above, two subfamilies containing genes encoding multimodular nrpss, the cyclo and acv synthetases, group with the primarily mono/bi-modular suite of nrpss. . sid synthetases show a relatively conserved domain architecture, are present in the majority of euascomycetes sampled, and are thought to have evolved by module duplication and selective loss of a domains or complete modules, as described in detail in bushley et al.  <cit> .

diversity within the eas subfamily
the eas subfamily, in additional to containing the vast majority of fungal nrpss, also shows the greatest diversity of both domain architecture and function . it includes proteins that are both structurally and functionally conserved , as well as those that are highly lineage specific . the highly diverse domain architectures and discontinuous distribution of corresponding a domains make the identification of orthologs across species extremely challenging.

chnps6/pera
perhaps the only group for which orthologs can be clearly identified are homologs of the most conserved nrps in the eas clade, chnps <dig>  which biosynthesizes an extracellular iron scavenging siderophore that serves as a virulence factor for several fungi and is also involved in combating oxidative stress  <cit>  . although chnps <dig> appears to have undergone a gene duplication event, it is single copy in all species examined except trichoderma reesii , which contains two paralagous copies. all chnps <dig> homologs have a highly conserved domain structure consisting of a single a-t-c module followed by a module with a degenerate a domain   <cit> . sister to the chnps <dig> group is a clade containing both chnps <dig> and an epichloe festucaenrps, pera; the latter nrps mediates symbiotic interactions of e. festuca with its grass host by producing an nrp insect deterrent, peramine  <cit>  .

ergot alkaloid synthetases
nrpss synthesizing ergot alkaloids consistently grouped sister to the chnps <dig> and chnps8/pera clade but without bootstrap support . these synthetases were found only in animal pathogens in the eurotiales and grass endophytes such as c. purpurea . given that grass endophytes such as c. purpurea are thought to have an animal pathogenic ancestor  <cit>  and that their ergot alkaloid nrp products have toxic effects on livestock and other animals  <cit> , we hypothesize that nrpss synthesizing ergot alkaloids originally evolved to function in animal pathogenesis.

peptaibol synthetases
peptaibol synthetases, which were restricted to the hypocrealean taxa examined in this study , also formed a well supported group. however, as discussed below, several modules of each peptaibol synthetase group outside of the main clade 

dothideomycete host-selective toxin synthetases
a domains of the a. alternata apple pathotype-specific amt synthetase which produces the host-selective toxin, am toxin, grouped consistently with modules  <dig> and  <dig> of chnps <dig> and chnps <dig> . modules of tetramodular c. carbonum hts <dig>  responsible for biosynthesis of another host selective toxin, the cyclic tetrapeptide, hc-toxin, grouped in disparate locations in the eas clade such that clear homologs of hts <dig> a domains were not recognizable in any of the species in our dataset .

chnps4
both hts <dig> and chnps <dig> a domain relationships exemplify the challenges of identifying orthologs within the rapidly evolving eas clade. chnps <dig> has been shown to play a role in c. heterostrophus conidial cell surface hydrophobicity and a homolog in the related dothideomycete alternaria brassicicola plays a role in conidial wall development and integrity  <cit> . each of the four a domains from each module of tetramodular chnps <dig> groups with strong support with the corresponding a domains of tetramodular abnps <dig> in the closely related dothideomycete, a. brassicae. these a domains group within a larger clade containing metarhizium anisopliae nrps pesa although without bootstrap support . however, a domains from nrpss found in other euascomycetes that group with each of the chnps <dig> modules contain from two to six modules. while some of these a domains are clearly related to those of chnps <dig>  module duplication and loss obscure the history of this group.

evolutionary mechanisms giving rise to multimodular nrpss
the greater diversity of domain architectures seen in multimodular nrpss is likely due to the multiplicity of evolutionary mechanisms which may generate the corresponding multimodular genes. the eas subfamily, in particular, contains nrpss varying from monomodular proteins involved in ergot alkaloid biosynthesis  and chnps <dig>  to the eighteen module tex <dig> synthetase responsible for peptaibol biosynthesis in trichoderma virens   <cit>  . several subgroups within the eas illustrate some of the mechanisms by which the diverse domain architectures of multimodular nrpss may arise.

tandem duplication
cyclosporin synthetase  is a clear example of tandem duplication of modules of an nrps in a single species . all eleven a domains from this protein group together as a single well supported monophyletic group  which also includes certain a domains from other fungal nrpss, such as chnps <dig> module  <dig> and chnps <dig> modules  <dig> and  <dig> 

peptaibol synthetases illustrate a more complex process of tandem duplication of modules of an nrps. peptaibol synthetases are highly lineage specific and found only within the hypocreales to date. using h. virens tex <dig> as a point of reference, we found that all modules of tex <dig> group together in three separate, well-supported clades with modules of two peptaibol synthetases  in the related species, trichoderma reesii . tex <dig> module  <dig> falls outside of the other two tex <dig> clades , the nearly one-to-one relationship between modules of tex <dig> and modules of t. reesii trire2_ <dig> suggests that tandem duplication of modules giving rise to these orthologous genes must have occurred prior to divergence of these two species . however, at least one additional internal duplication has occurred since divergence from an ancestral species  . the relationship of these two peptaibol synthetases with the t. reesii  <dig> module peptaibol synthetases, trire2_ <dig> is less straightforward. however, we note that certain a domains from trire2_ <dig> modules  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> form widowed branches at the base of clades which contain a domains of at least two, and more often, all three peptaibol synthetases . we hypothesize that these may be ancestral domains. previous studies suggest that like t. reesii, t. virens also harbors additional nrpss involved in peptaibol biosynthesis  <cit> .

recombination
two nrpss found in c. heterostrophus, chnps <dig> and chnps <dig>  demonstrate the potential role of recombination and modular rearrangement in the generation of multimodular nrpss. modules  <dig> and  <dig> of both chnps <dig> and chnps <dig> group within the eas subfamily with amt synthetase, a lineage specific nrps found only in a single strain of related a. alternata  <cit>  . module  <dig> of chnps <dig> and modules  <dig> and  <dig> of chnps <dig>  however, group with the cyclo synthetases among the mono/bi-modular nrps subfamilies . the phylogenetically unlinked locations of chnps <dig> and chnps <dig> modules in the larger phylogeny suggests that a recombination event must have given rise to the extant genes in c. heterostrophus . a domains of several other euascomycete nrpss, for example, bimodular fusarium equiseti enniatin synthetase  and trimodular m. oryzae, mgg <dig>  also show recombinant structures. module  <dig> a domains of both proteins group in the eas clade with the c. heterostrophus pseudogene chnps <dig>  but without bootstrap support , at positions distinct from modules  <dig> and  <dig> of chnps <dig> and chnps <dig>  the c-terminal a domain of esyn <dig> and the a domains of the final two modules of mgg <dig> group in the cyclo clade , like module  <dig> of chnps <dig> and modules  <dig> and  <dig> of chnps <dig>  thus, homologs of modules of chnps <dig> and chnps <dig> appear in different combinations in other fungi and demonstrate that recombination plays an important role in the evolution of multimodular nrpss.

stability of nrps gene copy number and domain architectures across subfamilies
many multigene families experience gene duplication and loss and evolve by a birth-death process  <cit> . variation in gene copy number resulting from gene duplication and loss is thought to be influenced by both functional and dosage requirements as well as random processes such as genomic drift  <cit> . recent studies suggest that functionally conserved genes, such as those involved in growth and development or other basic cellular processes, tend to experience both less variation in copy number  <cit>  and more stable domain organizations  <cit>  than genes involved in environmental and stress responses  <cit> .

for multimodular genes such as nrpss, duplication and loss or birth-death evolution  <cit>  can occur at two hierarchical levels: 1) at the level of the whole gene, and 2) at the level of domains within a gene . in the latter case, genes encoding nrpss whose products are involved in more conserved functions, such as the aars, would be expected to have more stable domain architectures than those encoding proteins with niche-specific functions. the latter may experience less functional constraint allowing for flexible gain and loss of domains leading to diversity of domain structures. because nrps a domains are involved in substrate selection  <cit> , their loss or gain could result in a rapid change in the chemical product of an nrps.

the range of variation in copy number of nrps-encoding genes and in number of a domains/nrps for each subfamily is shown for euascomycete taxa only in fig.  <dig>  variation in gene copy number is the highest for the eas subfamily but both the pks;nrps and chnps <dig> subfamilies also show substantial variation . the eas subfamily also shows by far the greatest variation in number of a domains/nrps, followed by cyclo and sid subfamilies, suggestive of less stable domain architectures and higher rates of intragenic domain duplication for these three groups. all of the remaining mono/bi-modular subfamilies show remarkably conserved domain architectures , supporting available functional data which suggests these groups may have more central conserved roles in metabolism.

when we compared gene and domain duplication and loss in different subfamilies across euascomycetes, no particular subfamily showed significant evidence for nonrandom expansion or contraction of number of genes. when patterns of the total number of a domains per subfamily were analyzed, the eas subfamily was the only group which showed highly significant  deviation from a random birth-death process . these results support other observations that gain and loss of domains is an important evolutionary force within the eas subfamily and may represent an adaptive response to niche-specific environmental pressures.

chain termination mechanisms
our survey revealed that fungal nrpss have a variety of c-terminal domains involved in chain termination. the most common for multimodular nrpss is a c domain while for monomodular nrpss it is an r domain . r domains have previously been identified and shown to play a role in peptide release in fungal aars  <cit> , a number of fungal pks;nrpss  <cit> , and in a minority of bacterial nrpss including safa and mxcg  <cit>  and the pks;nrps hybrid, myxalamid  <cit> . some multimodular nrpss, however, also have a terminal r domain suggesting this may be a common release mechanism for fungal nrpss. . two different release mechanisms have been identified for r type domains in fungal nrpss, indicating the possibility of r domains subtypes. in fungal aar's, the r domain reduces the enzyme bound α-aminoadipic acid  <cit> . the c-terminal r domain in the fungal pks;nrpss for equisetin biosynthesis , however, catalyzes a dieckmann condensation reaction, thus performing a function similar to bacterial te domains  <cit> . some mono- and some multi-modular nrpss terminate in t domains  although these have not been implicated previously in chain release.

as noted previously, bacterial nrpss generally have a te domain at the c-terminal end for peptide release but te domains have been found only in a few fungal nrpss, notably the acv synthetases  <cit> . we identified several other fungal nrpss , grouping with modules of cyclosporin synthetase, which also contain a c-terminal te domain . however, our data suggest that te domains are indeed rare in fungal nrpss providing further support for the claims of horizontal transfer from bacteria to fungi of genes encoding acv synthetases, and possibly these other fungal genes with te domains.

CONCLUSIONS
phylogenomic analysis identified nine major subfamilies of fungal nrpss which fall into two main groups: 1) a group of primarily mono/bi-modular enzymes  that group with bacterial nrpss, and 2) a group of primarily multimodular proteins  which appear both restricted to and highly expanded within fungi. analyses demonstrate that α-aminoadipate reductases are more closely related to nrpss than to other adenylating enzymes and provide further support for previous claims of horizontal transfer of certain nrpss from bacteria to fungi. in addition, phylogenomic relationships among subfamilies, taxonomic distributions, structural conservation of domain architecture, and known data on function suggest that several of the mono/bi-modular groups are older in origin and play more central roles in cellular metabolism. the highly expanded group of fungal multimodular nrpss, particularly the eas subfamily, have less conserved domain architectures due to domain/module duplication and loss, and tend to perform more niche-specific functions, typically considered the realm of "secondary" metabolites.
