BACKGROUND
oligonucleotide microarrays were first developed ~20 years ago  <cit> . present day microarrays are vastly superior to their predecessors in terms of quality, probe density, and they can represent an entire species genome  <cit> . microarray technology, together with advances in genomics and bioinformatics methodologies, revolutionized the ways that we interrogate and study genomes. these approaches have great power because they allow simultaneous survey and profiling of thousands of genes, and enable whole genomes to be assayed at particular moments in time and under specific conditions.

the scientific applications of microarray technology range from gene expression profiling, comparative genomic hybridization , and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, to single nucleotide polymorphism  detection. recently, next generation sequencing  has also been used as a major discovery tool in these applications, particularly where well-annotated whole genome datasets are available  <cit> . however, for species with large, complex , polyploid genomes, or for species with genomes that are not well annotated, ngs is relatively poorly suited to the detection of snps, insertions/deletions  and other variants because of the short sequencing reads and depth of sequencing coverage needed  <cit> . moreover, the computational overheads associated with the analysis of ngs data are a significant barrier to their use in some laboratories. by contrast, microarrays are well-established research tools that require only well-established analysis methods. these can be performed easily on personal computers, and allow rapid and routine analysis of multiple samples. hence, whilst the use of microarrays and ngs in genomic analysis will likely continue to be complementary  <cit> , we here describe work specifically aimed at optimizing genomic deletion mutation detection via microarray-based approaches.

the first discovery of a plant genomic deletion mutation using microarray-based cgh utilized the arabidopsis thaliana ath <dig> genome array, a single-chip array featuring  <dig>  probes representing approximately  <dig>  a. thaliana gene sequences. cgh using this array led to the discovery of a phenotype-causal 523 bp fast-neutron  irradiation-induced deletion mutation  <cit> . this deletion was within the second exon and intron of the a. thaliana athkt <dig> gene  in a previously identified ion accumulation mutant  <cit> . up to that point the identification of mutations that caused phenotypic changes in plants required laborious map-based cloning  <cit> .

mutagens such as fns frequently induce small genomic dna deletions of 1–6 bp  <cit>  and permit the identification of phenotype-causal mutations in an unbiased manner versus mutagens such as ems that almost exclusively cause g:c > a:t point mutations  <cit> . the use of tiling microarrays to discover these causal mutations potentially reduces the time, cost and labour needed, important when large numbers of samples are analysed  <cit> . however, mutation discovery remains a difficult process, especially with respect to relatively small-sized deletions.

in this study we describe the use of a graduated series of previously characterized a. thaliana genomic deletion mutations to discover the parameters required for rapid and robust detection of genomic deletion mutations, and in particular of relatively small sized deletion mutations. this series presents a range of deletion mutations, from 4 bp to ~5 kb, thus extending over a four orders of magnitude difference in deletion size. we use standard and customized versions of the roche nimblegen  <dig>  million feature high-resolution microarrays  <cit>  to detect these deletions via cgh, and are hence able to determine the oligonucleotide densities necessary to robustly detect genomic deletions as small as 4 bp in size. we show that this technology has the potential to uncover deletions that were not detectable with previous array based designs and equalling ngs-based technologies. our findings may improve microarray design for a wide variety of applications  <cit> .

RESULTS
arabidopsis oligonucleotide microarray design
the roche nimblegen custom a. thaliana cgh  <dig> × 720 k genome arrays can feature up to  <dig>  million probes. the custom array that we designed featured the  <dig>  million probes designed to the arabidopsis tair <dig> annotated reference genome  that represents  <dig>  protein coding genes,  <dig>  pseudogenes or transposable elements and  <dig>  non-coding rnas  at 49 bp staggering . in addition, ~ <dig>  ‘ultra-high density’ probes were added to the arrays to represent the genes atga <dig>  athkt <dig>  atphyb, athy <dig> and atmax <dig> and flanking genomic sequences . the single ‘ultra-high density’ probe set representing the larger deletions  were staggered every 6 bp apart . nineteen ‘ultra-high density’ probe sets were designed to represent the smaller deletions  in the mutant lines e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> and were staggered every:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 49 bp . these additional features allowed us to determine the probe densities required for effective detection of the deletions of 4 bp to more than 5 kb present in the plant lines ga1- <dig>  fn <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> . the genomic deletions in e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> were previously confirmed by direct pcr amplification  and sanger sequencing .

the arrays used in this study are unlike traditional tiling array formats that feature non-overlapping or partially overlapping probes with a maximum of one probe overlapping another. for example, in this study, the staggered probes designed every 2 bp can cover a single nucleotide position in the arabidopsis genome up to  <dig> times, versus the maximum of twice using conventional tiling arrays. probes containing sequences represented more than once in the genome were omitted from the final array design, and all probes in the ‘ultra-high density’ probe sets were unique within the tair <dig> annotated reference genome. the genomic distribution profiles of the ‘ultra-high density’ probes, like standard tiling arrays including the nimblegen cgh arrays, are essentially linear and unbiased unlike most transcript arrays which are biased towards the 3′ end of transcripts and sometimes overlap  <cit> . this is because sequence data are typically derived from est sequences with a 3′ bias, and the 3′ ends of genes are generally more variable and provide greater specificity  <cit> .

microarray-based discovery of deletion mutations
use of dna  for microarray-based deletion cloning strategies has a number of benefits, as the mrna abundance of many genes is too low to be efficiently and reliably detected. in addition, the relative levels of mrna could be altered due to the secondary effects of the deletion mutation  <cit> . dna from mutant plant lines or control lines labelled with cy <dig> or cy <dig> were co-hybridized to the cgh arrays. genome-wide mutant dna hybridization intensities were normalized with control genomic dna samples hybridized to the same cgh array. homotypic hybridizations  should result in a slope of cy <dig> versus cy <dig> intensity equal to one where normalized . however, a number of putative deletions and/or copy number variants  are always observed in such experiments as judged by a lack of hybridization intensity, or poor hybridization intensity of either the sample or control. reduced hybridization signals are likely due to experiment-to-experiment variability and variation in the hybridization efficiency between individual probes  <cit> .

to detect the two largest deletions in our graduated mutant collection, ga1- <dig>  and fn <dig> , we used a single probe staggering of 6 bp over each gene affected  . both deletions were observable at a genome-wide level . the larger ~5 kb deletion in ga1- <dig> at the ga <dig> locus was visible as an obvious ‘deletion signal’ on chromosome  <dig> . this deletion signal consisted of a set of neighbouring probes containing the ga <dig> gene sequence that hybridized with control ler dna but failed to hybridize with ga1- <dig> dna, and matched exactly the previously established size and location of the ga1- <dig> deletion  <cit> . the smaller deletion of 523 bp encompassing part of the hkt <dig> gene  <cit>  in the fn <dig> mutant was also observable on a genome-wide scale on chromosome  <dig> .

further analysis indicated the existence of seven other putative deletions displaying a probe ‘deletion profile’ threshold of  <dig> × s.d. in the ga1- <dig> mutant genome . to determine if these were genuine deletions, we designed oligonucleotides to a gene within each deleted region and performed diagnostic pcr analyses. pcrs confirmed three of the seven putative deletions were false positives  as the genes were amplified from both the ler control and ga1- <dig> mutant dna samples, see additional file 1: figure s4b. we could not confirm the existence of the four deletions on chromosomes 1– <dig> as pcr products could not be amplified from either the control or mutant lines. interestingly, we also observed a potential cnv  of ~ <dig>  kb on chromosome  <dig> , although it is alternatively possible that this signal represents a deletion event in the ler control.

the most striking result of the fn <dig> hybridization profile  was that there appeared to be a several large  regions of chromosome  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> that were deleted but no such deletions were observable on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> . similar to the deletions identified in the ga1- <dig> mutant versus control above, oligonucleotides were designed to six genes within these putative deleted regions and diagnostic pcr analyses performed to confirm authenticity. we did identify a deletion in the fn <dig> mutant on chromosome  <dig> of ~ <dig>  kb , see additional file 1: figure s4d. this deletion spanned the entire 4 kb sequence of a transposable element . an alternative explanation for this deletion profile could be either the natural loss or movement of this mobile element in the fn <dig> mutant genome. pcr analyses showed that the five other genes that appeared to be located in large deleted regions on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were actually present in both the control and fn <dig> mutant lines, see additional file 1: figure s4d. these false positives could be associated with high signal-to-noise due to non-specific probe hybridizations or suboptimal technical aspects of the hybridization procedure such as sample labelling or preparation. also, there is a possibility that there were dna sequence specific differences between the a. thaliana fn <dig> col- <dig> mutant  and the control a. thaliana col- <dig> line that had been propagated in our own laboratory since the 1990’s.

at a genome-wide scale, similar deletion profiles to the larger deletions  were observed for other arabidopsis mutants with smaller deletions . these deletion profiles were composed of nineteen staggered probe sets . although the numbers of probes required to detect these smaller deletions was higher than those for the larger deletions, the normalized deletion signals visualized at the phyb, hy <dig> and max <dig> loci , were similar in magnitude to the 523 bp hkt <dig> deletion  signal log <dig> ratio of ~ − <dig> but smaller than that observed for the ga1- <dig> deletion  . this was an interesting observation since the phyb, hy <dig> and max <dig> loci dna deletions varied in size by one to two orders of magnitude , and as a consequence the number of probes representing these deletions was different. this suggests that there is not a simple relationship between deletion size and the ability to detect it. a total of  <dig> probes partially covered the phyb deletion while the > <dig> times smaller deleted region of max <dig> was represented  <dig> times in comparison. also, the number of complete full-length probes covering these deletions differed:  <dig> covered the phyb deletion but there were none representing the max <dig> deletion, as the probe lengths were 50– <dig> mer and the size of the deletion just 4 bp.

interestingly, we also detected an additional deletion mutation in the e <dig> mutant  on chromosome  <dig> using the standard nimblegen probe set of 49 bp staggered probes . this deletion had a similar normalized signal log <dig> ratio of ~ − <dig> to the ga1- <dig> deletion mutation. oligos were designed to the flanking regions of this putative deletion and a pcr product was amplified  from e <dig> genomic dna confirming the deletion of  <dig>  bp that encompassed three genes: at1g <dig>  at1g <dig>  and at1g <dig>  which encoded a microrna, a dna repair exonuclease and a protein of unknown function, respectively. in addition, the presence of this ~7 kb genomic deletion and a number of other mutations including the 28 bp deletion in the hy <dig> gene, were confirmed by whole genome sequencing  <cit> .

in-depth analysis of probe densities required to detect relatively small genomic deletion mutations
to investigate the oligonucleotide probe resolutions required to detect genomic deletions smaller than those in ga1- <dig>  and fn <dig>  mutant lines, we compared the normalized hybridization profiles of individual probe datasets obtained for the e <dig> , e <dig>  and e <dig>  mutants. to do this we used nineteen probe sets staggered every  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 49 bp  over the affected genes, and determined the probe resolutions required to efficiently detect the different sizes of deletion.

scatter plots of the relative dna hybridization intensity , showed that the deletion mutations of 4 bp to 104 bp were observable as obvious deletion profiles using the lowest staggered probe staggering of 2 bp . likewise, the single staggered probe set of 6 bp used to identify the deletions present in the ga1- <dig> and fn <dig> mutant lines were also observable as obvious deletion profiles . however, the cost of producing microarrays with oligonucleotides staggered every 2 bp  or 6 bp would be prohibitive, especially for species with large genomes.

in order to determine the density of probes required to detect smaller dna deletions, we used a sliding window approach of two or three consecutive probes that had deletion profiles. to do this, the number of probes that either partially or fully covered the 4 bp to 104 bp deletions , were compared to the number of probes following hybridization that had a deletion profile . for example, of the  <dig> probes that were designed to span the whole phyb gene with 17 bp staggered probes , only  <dig> either partially or completely covered the 104 bp deletion  . eight of these probes , gave a detectable normalized deletion signal below the two s.d. threshold of ≤ − <dig> , .

further analysis was performed for all nineteen of the ‘designed’ and ‘detected’ ‘ultra-high density’ probe sets  representing the phyb 104 bp deletion  and the results are listed in table  <dig> and graphically shown in figure 5a. using a threshold of  <dig> consecutive probes that also had normalized log <dig> ratio intensities of ≤ − <dig>  , we found that probes staggered between 45 bp and the nimblegen ‘standard’ probe density of 49 bp were sufficient to identify this size of deletion mutation . we conclude that deletions of ~100 bp and larger can be confidently detected using tiling microarrays designed with isothermal probes staggered every 49 bp using a search criteria of ≥  <dig> consecutive probes that have a deletion profile. recently, a similar threshold of at least three consecutive probes with a normalized log <dig> ratio threshold of ≥  <dig> , has also been successful in identifying mutations  in human patients with drug resistant epilepsy  <cit> .

to detect smaller deletions of 28 bp  and 4 bp , higher probe densities than those used to detect the 104 bp above were needed. figure 5b shows that probes would need to be staggered between  <dig> and 32 bp to detect the hy <dig> 28 bp deletion, and between  <dig> and 12 bp to detect the 4 bp max <dig> deletion , using the same threshold of  <dig> consecutive probes with a deletion profile. however, if a less stringent threshold of just  <dig> consecutive probes was used, the 28 bp deletion was detectable using staggered probes of  <dig> to 47 bp, and likewise the 4 bp would be detectable using staggered probe resolutions of  <dig> to 25 bp.

previous studies have shown that one or two probes are sufficient to detect genomic deletions of ~100 bp  <cit>  and ~500 bp  <cit> , deletions that are considerably larger than the smallest deletion  analyzed in our study. our analyses of the ‘standard’ probes on the nimblegen arrays showed they were highly sensitive and highly reliable in detecting deletions of various sizes. for example, the 104 bp phyb deletion  was represented on our custom microarrays by three probes at the ‘standard’ staggering of 49 bp , while the smaller 28 bp and 4 bp deletions in the hy <dig>  and max <dig>  mutants were each represented just once at the same ‘standard’ staggering, respectively. however, all five of these ‘standard’ probes that represented these three different sized deletions gave normalized dna hybridization log <dig> ratio values of less than − <dig>  . this shows the excellent sensitivity of this type of microarray, but the detection of a genomic deletion with just a single probe risks background signal-to-noise interference, with the persistent possibility of false positives being called.

overall, the ‘ultra-high density’ probe sets used in our study enabled us to determine the number of probes required and at the precise staggering  that allow reliable detection of deletions of just a few bp in size. these results will aid researchers designing microarrays to detect deletions of different sizes without any a priori knowledge of the deletion. for example, using a stringent  <dig> consecutive probe criteria, deletions of ~100 bp require microarrays with probes staggered ≤ 45 bp while smaller deletions of ~30 bp need probes staggered ≤ 32 bp and deletions of a just a few bp require probes staggered ≤ 12 bp .

nimblegen microarray performance analysis
a previous study used an additional criterion to predict deletions in rice plants using microarrays based on a combination of probe threshold and probe proportions  <cit> . bruce et al.,  called putative deletions when ≥ 50% of the probes representing a gene model had probe log <dig> ratio intensities  of ≤ − <dig> . in our study, all nineteen ‘ultra-high density’ probe sets  used to detect the 4 bp, 28 bp and 104 bp deletions had ≥ 50% of probes with log <dig> ratio intensity ratios below the two s.d. threshold of ≤ − <dig> , indicative of genomic deletions . we found the average number of ‘detected’ probes with a ‘deletion profile’ out of all nineteen ‘designed’ ‘ultra-high density’ probe sets were: 94%, e124; 86%, e99; and 99%, e <dig> . for example, 95%  of the 2 bp staggered probes representing the smallest deletion  had a log <dig> ratio normalized intensity of less than − <dig>  . likewise, 84%  and 86%  of the 2 bp staggered probes covering the two larger deletions  had a log <dig> ratio normalized intensity of less than − <dig>  . although, the lowest values we observed were 50% for two out of the fifty-seven ‘ultra-high density’ probe sets , the overall results suggest that most of the ‘ultra-high density’ nimblegen cgh probe sets used in our study are highly sensitive, and are efficient in detecting deletion of various sizes.

discussion
microarrays are a powerful tool in the genetic analyses of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. in this study we determined the probe resolution required on microarrays to reliably detect genome deletions. using irradiated a. thaliana plant lines that were isolated from forward genetic screens, we were able to identify mutant phenotype-causal deletions that ranged in size from just a few bp to larger kb variants. although forward genetics has been used for almost 100 years, a major difficulty of this technique is the molecular identification of the causal mutations responsible for an observed phenotype. this is especially true for smaller deletions of just a few nucleotides that can remain undetected.

in order to study the appropriate density of probes on a microarray to detect small genomic deletions, we utilized a set of a. thaliana mutant plant lines that we had previously characterized. these mutants, obtained from an irradiation mutagenesis screen, had genomic deletions in three photomorphogenesis genes max <dig>  hy <dig>  and phyb. the deletions were 4 bp to 104 bp in size and made excellent test cases to optimize cgh-microarray based genomic deletion detection. we designed a nimblegen deletion profiling microarray to detect these a. thaliana mutations. this targeted array contained ultra-high density probes covering the entire genomic regions of the three genes affected and included exon, intron, promoter and utr sequences. the probes were added to the microarray in nineteen physically staggered designs to cover each region from 2 bp to 49 bp. following normalization of the hybridization signals of the mutants versus control samples, we could perform in-depth analysis of the probe densities required to confidently detect relatively small genomic deletions.

we found that to detect genomic deletions of ~100 bp, a microarray with probes staggered every 45 bp or less was required . we also found that smaller deletions of 28 bp and 4 bp required higher densities of probes of at least 22 bp and 10 bp, respectively . it is important to note that the long oligonucleotide probes  on the nimblegen microarrays we used in this study provided excellent detection sensitivity and reliability . microarrays from alternative manufacturers with shorter probes  might not have detected similar deletions because they have been shown to be less sensitive than longer probes  <cit> .

although most microarray applications are research-use-only, this technology is increasingly being used in clinical based genomic applications  <cit> . for example, microarrays have been used to identify dna deletions associated with serious human conditions such as cancer  <cit> , muscular dystrophy  <cit> , and osteoporosis  <cit> . in addition, personalized healthcare is a rapidly developing scientific area and microarrays may be utilised in the identification and early detection of treatable diseases  <cit> . the deletions reported in these previous clinical studies vary in size from 100's of bases to 100's of kilobases. while these studies demonstrate that arrays are an excellent tool for identifying dna deletions, the density of oligonucleotides required to detect smaller disease-causing deletions remains unclear.

with the advent of ngs it is now possible for genomes to be sequenced at high depth. however, at the present time no single platform, neither ngs nor microarrays, can identify all genomic sequence variants  <cit> . ngs can be very expensive, computational costs can be high and it can be time prohibitive for large numbers of samples  <cit> . indeed, whole-genome sequencing is not necessary for many research studies that focus on specific target regions, such as promoters, exons and regulatory elements. this is also true for genomes with highly repetitive dna sequences, such as the human and wheat genomes that are composed of 50% and 80% repeats, respectively  <cit> . for example, the  <dig> mbs of the extended human exome could easily be represented on a single array  <cit> . microarrays are a less labour intensive alternative to ngs and are likely to remain popular in research laboratories especially for those without extensive bioinformatic support. also, microarrays can provide rapid and parallel analysis of large numbers of samples. oxford gene technology, for example, processed  <dig>  samples in 20 weeks on behalf of the wellcome trust case control consortium researching cnvs in common human diseases  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the small deletions analysed in this report are typical of those found in plants following irradiation mutagenesis  <cit>  and in certain human disorders: frameshift causing deletions of 4 bp have been reported to be responsible for severe brain malformations  <cit> ; a condition in families that can cause the lung to collapse  <cit> ; and in a syndrome that can lead to increased risk of cancer of the colon, stomach, and pancreas  <cit> . our findings show that the probe density on a microarray is critical in identifying genomic deletions and is fundamental to the success of experiments. our results will help researchers working on both prokaryotes and eukaryotes to design microarrays with the optimal probe densities to detect both large and small deletions. these findings are applicable to any organism with a well-annotated sequenced reference genome.
