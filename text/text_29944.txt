BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a new class of single-stranded endogenous non-coding small rna molecules  that bind primarily to the 3′utr of target mrnas to repress their translation and accelerate their decay
 <cit> , and may regulate up to 30% of genes
 <cit> . the majority of mirnas are conserved across species and play essential roles in regulating many distinct processes such as brain morphogenesis
 <cit> , insulin secretion
 <cit> , virus immune defense
 <cit> , metabolism, and signal transduction
 <cit> . in addition, several studies have also revealed the significance of mirnas in myocyte proliferation and differentiation in recent years
 <cit> . for example, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> have distinct roles in modulating skeletal muscle proliferation and differentiation in cultured myoblasts in vitro and in xenopus laevis embryos in vivo. mir- <dig> promotes myogenesis by targeting histone deacetylase  <dig> , a transcriptional repressor of muscle gene expression. in contrast, mir- <dig> enhances myoblast proliferation by repressing serum response factor 
 <cit> . mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> are muscle specific mirnas
 <cit> . the transcription of mir- <dig> is induced by myod, which promotes myogenic differentiation
 <cit> . bone morphogenetic protein- <dig> , which is known to inhibit myogenesis, represses the expression of mir- <dig> by inhibiting its maturation process
 <cit> . similarly, overexpression of mir- <dig> during muscle differentiation is important to promote myogenesis by down-regulating the homeobox protein hox-a <dig>  an inhibitor of muscle differentiation
 <cit> . mir- <dig> has also been shown to induce myoblast differentiation by down-regulating pax7
 <cit> , while mir-27b regulates pax <dig> protein levels and ensures myogenic differentiation
 <cit> . recently, the myoblast cell line c2c <dig> was used for functional analysis of mir- <dig> in vitro <cit> . the results showed that mir- <dig> may target the negative regulators of myf <dig>  myod and myogenin in the corresponding stages of skeletal muscle development in vivo to regulate embryonic myogenesis. to date, mirnas have become one of the most abundant categories of gene regulatory molecules in mammalian species, but the role of individual mirnas in muscle development is still unknown.

currently  <dig>  mature mirnas have been discovered from  <dig> species and deposited in the publicly available mirna database mirbase  . specifically, the number of mirnas from bovine species is limited with only  <dig> reported, compared with  <dig>  from human and  <dig>  from mouse. despite the recognized importance of mirnas in regulating gene expression during development and other biological processes in beef, there has been little information about mirna expression in cattle. this is surprising given that cattle have tremendous importance not only for food production but as a mammalian model organism for comparative genomics and biological studies
 <cit> . recent related studies have been conducted to provide insight into the mirna population present in bovine species by investigating the characteristics, expression pattern and features of their target genes. for instance,  <dig> distinct mirnas were identified from bovine adipose tissue and mammary gland in  <dig> alone
 <cit> . bta-mir <dig> and bta-mir-10b are highly abundant in germinal vesicle oocytes, as well as in early stage embryos 
 <cit> . mir-196a is a bona fide negative regulator of the newborn ovary homeobox gene  during bovine early embryogenesis
 <cit> . expression of bovine nucleoplasmin  <dig>  is temporally regulated during early embryogenesis by mir-181a
 <cit> . approximately 20% of the mirnas involved in adipogenesis and lipid deposition were identified as being correlated with backfat thickness. the results suggest that mirnas play a regulatory role in white adipose tissue development in beef
 <cit> .

given the emerging roles of mirnas in development, identifying the differentially expressed mirnas is an important first step to investigating the function of mirnas in the course of bovine growth and development. in this study, we have constructed two small rna cdna libraries from chinese qinchuan bovine longissimus thoracis at fetal and adult stages. by high throughput sequencing of the small rna libraries and subsequent bioinformatic analysis, mirnas in the longissimus thoracis were identified. in addition, the expression patterns of the high-read mirnas from differential tissues  at multiple developmental stages of bovine muscle tissues  were evaluated. elucidation of the expression patterns of different mirnas among different tissues will contribute to understanding the roles of mirnas in gene expression regulatory networks for particular biological functions in livestock species.

RESULTS
tissue collection and high-throughput sequencing of small rnas
skeletal muscle is composed of myofibers, intramuscular adipocytes and connective tissue. myofibers are the structural units of skeletal muscle
 <cit> . in livestock, all muscle fibers are formed during the prenatal stage. bovine prenatal myogenesis can be briefly divided into three different generations of cells, which appear at around  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days of fetal life 
 <cit> . in contrast, postnatal skeletal muscle development is mainly due to the increase in muscle fiber size
 <cit> , and new muscle fibers are only generated during the adult stage to replace injured muscle fibers
 <cit> . this pattern is significantly different between prenatal and postnatal bovine muscle development. hence, in this study fetal and adult chinese qinchuan bovine longissimus thoracis were collected and two mirna libraries were constructed for solexa sbs technology sequencing.

to identify the small rnas involved in bovine muscle proliferation and differentiation, total rnas from bovine longissimus thoracis at fetal and adult stages were used to construct small rna libraries. we obtained  <dig> , <dig> clean reads from the fetal bovine library and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads from the adult bovine library after deleting some contaminant reads . length distribution analysis showed that most reads ranged from  <dig> to 23nt. the percentage of the 22nt reads in the total reads was  <dig> % for the fetal stage and  <dig> % for the adult stage . next, all solexa reads were aligned against the latest bovine genome assembly using the program soap
 <cit>  and  <dig> , <dig> reads of the fetal bovine library were perfectly matched to the bovine genome as well as  <dig> , <dig> reads of the adult bovine library. the most abundant  rna species in both libraries were classified as mirnas, representing  <dig> % of the fetal library and  <dig> % of the adult library. the genome-matched small rna tags were then clustered into several rna categories  in the two libraries . additionally, a high percentage of small rnas were sorted as unknown rnas .

identification of conserved bovine mirnas
there are currently  <dig> bta-mirna precursors and  <dig> mature bta-mirnas containing  <dig> bta-mirnas,  <dig> bta-mirna*,  <dig> bta-mirna-5p and  <dig> bta-mirna-3p in mirbase. to identify conserved mirnas in the skeletal muscle tissue of the qinchuan bovine, the small rnas with a length of 18– <dig> nucleotides were blastn searched against the mirbase  <dig>  .  <dig>  unique sequences  were annotated as mirna candidates in the fetal bovine library as well as  <dig>  unique sequences  in the adult bovine library, while the rest were unannotated. the mirna candidates were then clustered into  <dig> and  <dig> categories corresponding to  <dig> and  <dig> independent genomic loci in the two libraries according to sequence similarity , of which  <dig> mirnas overlapped in both libraries . each category included multiple homologs, which differed in sequence length by only 1– <dig> nucleotides. such homologous sequences with different lengths are thought to be variants produced by various biochemical modifications and by imprecise processing of primary or precursor mirnas by drosha and dicer enzymes. in two cases , we discovered that mirna* were more abundant than corresponding mirna as evidenced by higher counts of sequence reads originating from the mirna* arms of the mirna precursor sequences. although these cases could be simple annotation artifacts, it is also possible that they reflect the regulated processing of pre-mirna, which results in preferential use of the different arms of the mirna precursor
 <cit> . we also identified two mirnas  that demonstrated nearly equal numbers of sequence reads originating from the 5' and 3' arms of the mirna hairpin precursor. the approximate equivalent expression rates of mirna and mirna*  may be due to the similar 5' end stability, which results in equal incorporation of either strand into the rna-induced silencing complex  and protection from degradation
 <cit> . accordingly, such mirna genes have also been predicted and validated in chicken
 <cit> , drosophila
 <cit>  and cow
 <cit> . these mirna precursors may produce functional molecules on both arms.

the expression of known mirnas in the two samples was demonstrated by plotting log2-ratio and scatter plot . the expression profiles between the two libraries are shown in additional file
 <dig>  the results show that  <dig> mirnas consist of  <dig> up-expressed mirnas and  <dig> down-expressed mirnas. these were significantly different between the two libraries. for example, the expression of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> was higher in fetal bovine muscle tissue, in contrast with the patterns shown by mir- <dig>  mir-133a, and mir-29a in adult bovine muscle tissue. this suggests that these mirnas may affect the development of muscle tissue. additionally nucleotide bias analysis at each position showed the gc content had a high frequency in the 3rd, 7th, and 19th positions with percentages of  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively, while it seldom appeared at the 4th, 5th, 8th, 11th, and 20th positions with percentages of  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % in the adult bovine library, respectively. equally reputable studies have shown the opposite results in the fetal bovine library. in both libraries, nucleotides a + u were distributed mainly in the remaining positions with the exception of the 2nd, 12th, 15th, and 21st positions . the phenomenon of nucleotide bias might be concerned with the mechanisms of mirna action, such as binding with the targets for gene regulation. in addition, zhang et al. reported that the 1st, 9th, and the terminal positions were enriched with u and the 1st and 9th positions were the limits of the “seed region” of a mirna, which was responsible for targeting mrnas for gene regulation
 <cit> . we showed a similar result in bovine mirnas at the first and the end positions, but there was only  <dig> % at the ninth position in the adult bovine library. the differences observed between our study and previous studies may have been due to different experimental approaches or differences in the samples .

position 2– <dig> of a mature mirna is called the seed region, which is highly conserved. the target of a mirna might be different with the change of nucleotides in this region. in our analysis pipeline, mirnas that might have base edit can be detected by aligning unannotated srna tags with mature mirnas from mirbase <dig>  allowing one mismatch at a certain position. the results showed that approximately  <dig> % in the adult bovine library and  <dig> % in the fetal bovine library of the identified mirna sequences were found to have mismatches that were caused by post-transcriptional modification, and/or rt-pcr, and sequencing errors . the prevailing sequence alterations such as 3' terminal a or u additions and a-to-g transitions could result from post-transcriptional modification
 <cit> . in addition, alignment of the identified sequences revealed that end variants were present in most mirnas, which were apparently generated from the same precursor. most end variants differed by one or several nucleotides at the 3' end nucleotide and a small percentage of them differed at the 5' end. for example, mir-105b, mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> only had 3' end variants. mir-142a, mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> differed by only one nucleotide in the 5' end, but they had several 3' end variants . variation in end  in mirnas may result from the processing of double-stranded rna , short hairpin rna  and mirna precursors by dicer
 <cit> .

to date,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> conserved mirnas were identified in human, mouse, chicken, dog, horse, sheep, zebrafish and wild boar, respectively
http://www.mirbase.org/. in our study, further analysis identified a total of  <dig> and  <dig> conserved mirnas that belonged to  <dig> mirna families in adult and fetal bovine libraries. the identified mirna families have been shown to be conserved in a variety of species. for example, let- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> families have been found in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> species, respectively, while mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> families have only been detected in bos taurus . this may suggest a species-specific expression profile for mirnas. the largest mirna family size identified was mir- <dig>  which consisted of  <dig> members, and let- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir-181/ <dig> possessed  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> members, respectively; whereas other mirna families such as mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> had only one member . the finding that most members of conserved mirna families were expressed in the bovine longissimus thoracis supports the idea that regulatory or functional diversification has occurred
 <cit> . different family members also displayed drastically different expression levels. for example, the abundance of the mir- <dig> family varied from  <dig> read  to  <dig>  reads  with deep sequencing. this was also the case for some other mirna families, such as bta-let- <dig> , bta-mir- <dig>  and bta-mir- <dig> . however, the expression levels of some mirna families were similar, such as mir- <dig> in which  <dig> and  <dig> reads were detected, respectively. the existence of a dominant member in a mirna family may suggest that the regulatory role of this family was performed by the dominant member at the developmental time when the samples were collected for rna extraction. abundance comparisons of different members in a mirna family may provide valuable information on the role that mirnas play in that specific stage of bovine development.

identification of novel bovine mirnas
the characteristic hairpin structure of a mirna precursor can be used to predict novel mirna. prediction software mireap
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mireap/ was developed to predict novel mirna by exploring the secondary structure, the dicer cleavage site and the minimum free energy of the unannotated small rna tags that could be mapped to a genome. the following criteria
 <cit>  were used for screening the candidates for potential mirnas or pre-mirnas:  pre-mirna sequences can fold into an appropriate hairpin secondary structure that contains the ~22nt mature mirna sequence within one arm of the hairpin.  mirna precursors with secondary structures had higher negative minimal free energies  and minimal free energy indexes  than other different types of rnas.  mirna had an au content of 30–70%.  mirna had less than six mismatches with the opposite mirna* sequence in the other arm.  no loop or break in mirna sequences was allowed. based on solexa sequencing, we identified  <dig> novel bovine mirnas, which corresponded to  <dig> genomic loci. thirty-six novel mirnas were in the adult bovine library and  <dig> were in the fetal bovine library, of which  <dig> overlapped in both libraries . in addition, an examination of pre-mirnas and other rnas  revealed that mirnas were significantly different from other rnas
 <cit> . specifically, more than 90% of mirna precursors have an mfei greater than  <dig> , significantly higher than trnas , rrnas , or mrnas . the results suggested that the mfei can easily be used to distinguish mirna from other non-coding and coding rnas. this provides a more precise criterion to predict mirnas using computational approaches, and in our database  <dig> had a mfei greater than  <dig> . remarkably, the read number for each novel mirna was much lower than that for the majority of conserved mirnas. for instance, bta-mirn <dig> with the highest read number and bta-mirn <dig> with the lowest were both novel mirnas, and the total reads were only  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. recently, similar results in pigs
 <cit>  and even in maize
 <cit>  have also been reported.

validation of related bovine mirnas
the mirna expression patterns in different tissues have been investigated in cattle
 <cit> . in beef cattle, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in the brain, mir- <dig> in the liver, and mir- <dig>  mir-133a, and mir- <dig> in muscle are all tissue-specific
 <cit> . for validation and identification of muscle-related mirnas in qinchuan cattle, stem-loop qpcr
 <cit>  analysis of mirna expression was performed in fetal, calf and adult skeletal muscle, heart, liver, lung, kidney, brain, intestines, fat and spleen. in the present study, we randomly picked out several high-read mirnas, including a total of  <dig> conserved and  <dig> novel mirnas. comparison of mirna expression profiles among tissues revealed that mir-2284x in liver, and mirna- <dig>  mirna- <dig>  mirna- <dig>  mirn <dig>  and mirn <dig> in muscle-related tissue or organs  were highly expressed . in contrast, five conserved mirnas  and seven novel mirnas  could be quantified from all tissues and several of them  were relatively consistent across all nine tissue types. in addition, only bta-mirna-29a, mirna- <dig>  and mirn <dig> were not expressed in fat, while mirn <dig> and mirn <dig> were detected in all tissues except spleen. another two mirnas  were not found in fat and spleen tissues . in the present study, the bta-mir-487b, mir- <dig>  mirn <dig>  and mirn <dig> were not identified in the bovine calf and/or adult muscles, but were highly expressed in the fetal stage and in other differentiated tissues. it could be that some protein expression of muscle-specific genes from the tested individuals at postnatal days represses the expression of these mirnas by inhibiting their maturation process. this is similar to the results between bone morphogenetic proteins- <dig>  and mir-206
 <cit> . the expression patterns and level of  <dig> mirnas in all tested bovine tissues suggests that these mirna may be more relevant to the highly conserved biological process in mammalians. further study to discover their regulatory functions is needed.

to further explore the muscle-specific mirnas involved in the muscle development of the cattle, we performed quantitative analysis of the mirnas in fetal , calf  and adult  bovine longissimus thoracis. the results showed that expression of bta-mirna- <dig> and mirn <dig> was increased in the muscle tissues from day  <dig> bovine embryos to 2-year-olds, respectively. however, the expression levels of bta-mirna- <dig>  mirna- <dig>  and mirn <dig> did not change between day  <dig> bovine embryo and 2-year muscle tissues, but significantly increased in the calf muscle tissue . previous studies in vitro have shown that mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> can target multiple muscle-development-related genes. specifically, muscle-specific mir- <dig>  which is directly activated by myod, can target sequences in the fstl <dig> and utrn gene and these sequences are sufficient to suppress gene expression in the presence of mir-206
 <cit> . mir- <dig> promotes myogenesis by targeting hdac <dig>  a transcriptional repressor of muscle gene expression. in contrast, mir- <dig> enhances myoblast proliferation by repressing srf
 <cit> . also, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> regulate pax <dig> directly. inhibition of these two substantially enhances satellite cell proliferation and increases pax <dig> protein levels in vivo <cit> . although the bovine-specific target genes of mirna- <dig>  mirna- <dig>  mirna- <dig>  mirn <dig>  and mirn <dig> are not known, their consistent expression pattern and high conservation indicate that they are also likely to play roles in the development of bovine muscle tissues.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas in longissimus thoracis from fetal and adult qinchuan bovine using deep sequencing technologies. this study expands the repertoire of bovine mirnas and could initiate further study in the muscle development of cattle. in addition, the mirna expression patterns among nine tissues in beef cattle showed that most mirnas are ubiquitously expressed, suggesting that these mirnas may play a role in a broad range of biological processes in various tissues. however, we have also identified some muscle-specific mirnas, suggesting that these mirnas are likely to play a role in the development of bovine muscle tissues and could be potential molecular markers for genetics and breeding.
