BACKGROUND
fluorescent proteins  are useful as whole-cell labels. for this purpose, fps can be either monomeric or oligomeric. however, oligomeric fps are often better for whole-cell labeling because they tend to be brighter and more photostable than their monomeric counterparts  <cit> .

even if an fp has desirable fluorescence properties, it may have limited utility as a cellular label due to cytotoxicity at high expression levels  <cit> . cytotoxicity has been observed with many red and orange fps in both bacterial and mammalian cells  <cit> . recently, we described a tetrameric dsred variant called dsred-express <dig> that is ideally suited to whole-cell labeling due to its minimal cytotoxicity, fast maturation, and high photostability  <cit> . to create dsred-express <dig>  we mutated the surface of dsred-express   <cit>  to decrease higher-order aggregation of the tetramers. these mutations allowed dsred-express <dig> to be well tolerated when expressed at high levels.

here, we have modified the interior of dsred-express <dig> to create two additional fps that are useful for whole-cell labeling. the first new fp, e2-orange, exhibits orange fluorescence similar to that of previously described orange fps  <cit> . e2-orange matures quickly, and is substantially less cytotoxic and more photostable than other available orange fps. the second new fp, e2-red/green, emits both red and green fluorescence, and can be distinguished from pure red or pure green fps. e2-orange and e2-red/green will be particularly useful for multi-color whole-cell labeling.

RESULTS
an orange derivative of dsred-express2
orange fps can be useful alone, in two-color studies with green fps, or in three-color studies with green and far-red fps. the previously available orange fps include the oligomeric kusabira-orange   <cit> , a monomeric derivative of ko called mko <dig>  <cit> , and a monomeric orange variant of dsred called morange <dig>  <cit> . to engineer an orange derivative of dsred-express <dig>  we mutated the first residue of the chromophore, glutamine- <dig>  to threonine. in morange, threonine at position  <dig> drives formation of a third heterocycle  in the chromophore, leading to blue-shifted spectra relative to dsred  <cit> . introduction of the same q66t mutation into dsred-express <dig> resulted in blue-shifted excitation and emission maxima, indicating that the same chromophore cyclization chemistry can occur in the dsred-express <dig> interior.

dsred-express <dig> + q66t was then subjected to random mutagenesis to identify brightening mutations. we identified two such mutations, v71a and s179t. both mutations produced modest increases in extinction coefficient and quantum yield, and the s179t mutation also accelerated maturation. these mutations were combined to yield the final orange variant, e2-orange .

e2-orange has excitation and emission maxima at  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm, respectively . as with dsred-express <dig>  a substantial fraction of the fully mature e2-orange molecules contain a blue-absorbing and green-emitting chromophore . however, excitation with blue light does not produce significant green fluorescence, presumably due to efficient intra-tetramer förster resonance energy transfer . the presence of two chromophore species explains why e2-orange has a lower extinction coefficient than other orange fps when excited with yellow light . when excited with blue light, e2-orange is comparable in brightness to other orange fps .

unless otherwise indicated, all measurements were carried out during the present study using standardized procedures.

a brightness was calculated as the product of extinction coefficient and quantum yield, and was normalized to a value of  <dig> for wild-type dsred as calculated from ref.  <dig> 

b photobleaching half-times during widefield illumination are listed as mean ± s.e.m. for three independent replicates.

c for dsred-express <dig> and mko <dig>  all data except the pka measurements were taken from ref.  <dig> 

d the photobleaching half-time for the green chromophore of e2-red/green cannot be compared directly to the photobleaching half-times of red chromophores because a different filter set was used.

e2-orange matures quickly and is photostable . compared to previously available orange fps, e2-orange matures much faster than morange <dig> or ko and about as fast as mko <dig>  with a half-time of  <dig>  h at 37°c . we measured photostability with a simple assay involving a fixed illumination intensity  <cit> , and found that e2-orange is more photostable than any of the other orange fps tested . e2-orange has a pka of  <dig> , making it the least acid-sensitive of the orange fps tested . thus, the fluorescence properties of e2-orange are favorable for whole-cell labeling.

to demonstrate the usefulness of e2-orange in two-color labeling studies, the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae was transformed with vectors for high-level expression of either enhanced gfp  or e2-orange. by flow cytometry, these two populations of cells could be readily distinguished from each other and from cells not expressing an fp .

to demonstrate the usefulness of e2-orange as a third color in fluorescence microscopy, a s. cerevisiae strain was engineered to express cytosolic e2-orange, plus sec7-egfp to mark the late golgi with green fluorescence  <cit> , plus pcoxiv-mcherry to mark mitochondria with moderately far-red fluorescence  <cit> . the egfp and e2-orange signals were easily resolvable, and the e2-orange and mcherry signals could be separated using linear unmixing, yielding clear three-color images . the need for linear unmixing indicates that fps further red-shifted than mcherry  will be most useful for three-color imaging with e2-orange and gfp.

a red and green dual-color derivative of dsred-express2
an fp that has both red and green fluorescence can be a useful "third color" for flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy  <cit> . fully mature wild-type dsred is a mixture of molecules with either red- or green-emitting chromophores, but excitation of the green chromophores yields red fluorescence due to intra-tetramer fret  <cit> . our previous identification of rapidly maturing dsred variants led to discovery of the n42h mutation, which accelerates the maturation of wild-type dsred more than 10-fold  <cit> . however, this mutation also increases the fraction of green-emitting chromophores, so that excitation with blue light now results in a substantial amount of green emission  <cit> .

we took advantage of the n42h mutation to create a dual-color red and green derivative of dsred-express <dig>  first, dsred-express <dig> was mutated to revert chromophore-facing mutations that had previously been introduced to minimize green fluorescence . the n42h mutation was then added to yield e2-red/green . when excited with blue light, e2-red/green emits strongly at both red and green wavelengths . when excited with yellow light to produce red fluorescence, e2-red/green is as bright as wild-type dsred and more than twice as bright as dsred-express <dig> . the red and green chromophores of e2-red/green mature quickly with half-times of  <dig>  h and  <dig>  h, respectively . both chromophores are extremely photostable, even more so than the chromophores of dsred-express <dig> and egfp .

c these mutations were identified during random mutagenesis. all other mutations resulted from targeted mutagenesis.

to show that e2-red/green can be used as a third marker in conjunction with a green and a red fp, s. cerevisiae cells expressing dsred-express <dig>  egfp, e2-red/green, or no fp were grown separately and then pooled. this mixture was analyzed by flow cytometry with a 488-nm excitation laser. the three populations of fluorescent cells could be readily distinguished from one another and from the population of cells not expressing an fp .

the new fps are soluble and show low cytotoxicity and low phototoxicity in bacteria
high-level expression in bacteria is the basis of convenient assays for fp solubility, cytotoxicity, and phototoxicity  <cit> . we used this approach to compare the new fps to dsred-express <dig> and to previously available orange fps. one complication was that human codon-optimized ko is expressed poorly in bacteria, presumably due to unfavorable mrna secondary structure near the start codon  <cit> . this problem was overcome by applying a method that had previously been used to optimize bacterial expression of dsred-express <dig>  <cit> . we screened bacteria expressing a library of modified ko genes that contained random combinations of the synonymous codons for amino acids 2– <dig>  a sequence yielding colonies with bright fluorescence was designated ko*. predicted secondary structures near the 5' ends of the ko and ko* mrna sequences were compared using the program mfold  <cit> . the ko mrna contained a predicted stable stem-loop involving the ribosomal binding site, and this stem-loop was disrupted in the ko* mrna . this change may account for the stronger bacterial expression of ko*.

to confirm that the new fps retain the high solubility of dsred-express <dig>  we used a bacterial lysis and centrifugation assay in which aggregated oligomeric fps are found in the pellet  <cit> . as with dsred-express <dig>  only 3–5% of the total fluorescence signal was found in the pellet with e2-orange and e2-red/green . by contrast, with ko*, > 50% of the fluorescence signal was in the pellet , indicating that this protein undergoes higher-order aggregation.

to test whether the new fps retain the low bacterial cytotoxicity of dsred-express <dig>  we examined colony size for e. coli cells expressing high levels of various fps  <cit> . this experiment employed a regulatable promoter in which expression was derepressed using isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside . in the absence of iptg, all of the colonies were large, as expected . when iptg was included in the medium, large colonies were seen for cells expressing dsred-express <dig>  e2-orange, or e2-red/green, but much smaller colonies were seen for cells expressing morange <dig> or ko*, indicating that the latter two proteins are cytotoxic . we previously documented that mko <dig> is also cytotoxic in bacteria  <cit> . sds-page of whole-cell lysates confirmed that all of the fp genes except the original ko were expressed at comparable levels . ko did not cause cytotoxicity in the presence of iptg  due to very low expression . these data indicate that like dsred-express <dig>  e2-orange and e2-red/green exhibit unusually low cytotoxicity in bacteria.

another experimentally relevant fp characteristic is phototoxicity during prolonged illumination. we used a bacterial cell survival assay  <cit>  to measure the phototoxicity of e2-orange, e2-red/green, and mko <dig> during illumination through a texas red filter. this assay was not technically feasible with morange <dig> or ko* due to their slow maturation rates . control cells not expressing an fp showed nearly 100% survival . e2-orange and e2-red/green showed low to moderate phototoxicity with 91% and 69% survival, respectively. mko <dig> showed high phototoxicity, with only 13% survival under the same conditions. these differences in phototoxicity were not due to different expression levels . we conclude that e2-orange and e2-red/green are likely to exhibit relatively mild phototoxicity during live-cell imaging.

the new fps show low cytotoxicity in hela cells
to determine whether the dsred-express <dig> derivatives retain low cytotoxicity in mammalian cells, a fluorescence maintenance assay was performed  <cit> . hela cells were transiently transfected to express dsred-express <dig>  e2-orange, e2-red/green, morange <dig>  or ko under control of the strong cmv promoter, and the average brightness of fluorescent cells was monitored for five days using flow cytometry . as previously observed, cells expressing dsred-express <dig> remained bright over the course of the experiment. similarly, for cells expressing e2-orange or e2-red/green, average cellular brightness was maximal at  <dig> h post-transfection and had decreased by < 10% at  <dig> h post-transfection. by contrast, for cells expressing morange <dig> or ko, average cellular brightness had decreased at  <dig> h by 40–50%. the source of this decrease can be seen by comparing the flow cytometry data from  <dig> h and  <dig> h. we assigned cells to groups, each of which represented a range of brightness values, and then plotted the percentage of cells in each group . at  <dig> h, the brightness of the transfected cells spanned from background fluorescence up to about 1000-fold over background. at  <dig> h, cells expressing high levels of dsred-express <dig>  e2-orange, or e2-red/green were detected with unchanged frequencies, but cells expressing high levels of morange <dig> or ko were depleted from the population . a similar loss of highly expressing cells was documented previously for mko <dig>  <cit> . the combined data indicate that dsred-express <dig> and its derivatives are noncytotoxic even at high expression levels, whereas previously available orange fps show considerable cytotoxicity in mammalian cells.

CONCLUSIONS
we predicted that it should be possible to modify the interior of dsred-express <dig> while preserving the optimized surface, thereby generating new noncytotoxic fps with a variety of spectral properties  <cit> . the current study verifies that prediction. we incorporated mutations that had been reported to change the dsred emission either to orange  <cit>  or to a mixture of red and green  <cit> . the resulting dsred-express <dig> derivatives, e2-orange and e2-red/green, have favorable fluorescence properties including brightness, fast maturation, and high photostability. importantly, these new fps maintain the low cytotoxicity of dsred-express <dig> in bacterial and mammalian cells.

e2-orange outperforms other available orange fps by several criteria . for comparison, morange <dig> is photostable, but matures slowly and is very acid-sensitive  <cit>  with a pka of  <dig> . mko <dig> matures as quickly as e2-orange, but is photolabile and phototoxic. of the previously available fps, ko is probably the best suited to whole-cell labeling because its slow maturation is offset by high brightness and reasonable photostability. indeed, ko has been used to label murine hematopoietic stem cells  <cit>  and to generate systemically labeled transgenic pigs  <cit> . how can we reconcile these results with the clear cytotoxicity of ko in our assays? we propose that reports of stable expression of ko and other cytotoxic fps  <cit>  reflect a threshold effect in which a cytotoxic fp is tolerated below a certain expression level. thus, even if a cytotoxic fp is intrinsically bright, the observed signal may be relatively weak due to selection for low expression, and this low expression may cause residual cytotoxicity. by contrast, high-level expression of e2-orange is likely to be maintained with little detrimental effect to the cells.

e2-red/green can be used as a "third color" in combination with existing green and red fps in cases where three distinct cell populations each express a single type of fp. this type of application was suggested by verkhusha and colleagues, who described a novel gfp variant, r10- <dig>  in which a small fraction of the molecules generate a red chromophore  <cit> . e2-red/green should be easier to use as a dual-color cell label because its red emission is approximately 100-fold greater than that of r10- <dig>  as an example of a potential application of e2-red/green, a standard 488-nm laser efficiently excites egfp, dsred-express <dig>  and e2-red/green, allowing three cell populations to be distinguished by flow cytometry. for fluorescence microscopy applications, images from green and red channels can be overlaid to distinguish cells expressing e2-red/green from those expressing either a pure green or a pure red fp. in this case, the cells expressing e2-red/green will appear yellow in the overlaid images, while the other cells will appear either red or green.

because e2-orange and e2-red/green are tetramers, they are useful for whole-cell labeling rather than for making fusion proteins. further modifications of the chromophore environment should enable us to generate additional whole-cell labels. for example, a far-red derivative of dsred-express <dig> would be ideal for whole-animal imaging, and for multi-color labeling of cell populations in conjunction with e2-orange.
