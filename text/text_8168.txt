BACKGROUND
the immunoregulatory effects of acute and chronic alcohol use have been linked to negative clinical outcomes including prolonged recovery after trauma or burn injury, elective surgery, liver disease and infections  <cit> . excessive alcohol consumption was also identified as an independent risk factor in hepatitis c virus  infection that leads to chronic infection in up to 80% of cases  <cit> . excessive alcohol use also affects outcomes in hiv infection and predisposes to advanced disease  <cit> . both hcv and hiv are single-stranded rna viruses that induce anti-viral innate immune responses via host pathways that recognize the viral "danger signals"  <cit> . toll-like receptor  <dig>  can sense single-stranded rna from both hiv and hcv viruses and triggers downstream signaling to induce production of type i ifns and pro-inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . tlr <dig> is expressed in monocytes and macrophages and it is localized intracellularly in the endosomes where it is positioned to be expose to viral danger signals  <cit> .

limited numbers of previous studies evaluated the effects of alcohol on virus-induced immune responses and mostly showed decreased antiviral immune responses  <cit> . in hepatoma cells, alcohol was shown to affect innate antiviral pathways and increase hcv replication in human liver cells  <cit> . the effects of alcohol exposure on anti-viral immune responses are yet to be delineated in human immune cells that contribute to the production of both type i ifns and inflammatory cytokines  <cit> .

in addition to viral danger signals, gut-derived lipopolysaccharide , a ligand of toll like receptor  <dig> , has been shown to play a role in hiv and hcv infection as well as in complications of chronic alcohol exposure  <cit> . it has been shown that serum/plasma lps levels are elevated in patients with untreated hiv infection and a moderate increase in serum lps was also reported in patients with chronic hcv infection  <cit> . it has been postulated that the source of the circulating lps is the gut due to increased gut permeability  <cit> . increased gut permeability and an increase in circulating lps levels are the central components in the pathogenesis of alcoholic hepatitis  <cit> . thus, lps/tlr <dig> stimulation has direct clinical relevance to hiv and hcv as well as alcohol consumption.

the effects of alcohol on lps/tlr <dig> signaling were evaluated in numerous previous studies, however, the effects of alcohol on tlr4-induced ifn responses are yet to be defined. here, we tested the hypothesis that acute and prolonged alcohol exposures modulate pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as type i ifn induction in response to tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> ligand stimulation.

RESULTS
tlr8- and tlr4-induced type i ifn production is inhibited by acute and prolonged alcohol treatment in human monocytes
innate immune responses by circulating monocytes and tissue macrophages are triggered by viral and bacterial danger signals to induce type i ifns and inflammatory cascade activation  <cit> . tlr <dig>  expressed in the endosome senses single-stranded rna while tlr <dig>  expressed on the cell membrane is activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide  <cit> . here we tested the hypothesis that alcohol interferes with type i ifn production in response to viral or bacterial pathogen-derived signals. human peripheral blood monocytes were stimulated with a tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> ligand in the presence or absence of  <dig> mm alcohol. this in vitro treatment represents acute alcohol exposure in humans as  <dig> mm alcohol approximates  <dig>  g/dl blood alcohol level often found after consumption of 4- <dig> drinks in non-alcoholic individuals  <cit> . monocyte stimulation with cl <dig>  or lps  resulted in a significant increase in ifnβ production at  <dig> hours after stimulation while alcohol treatment alone did not affect baseline ifnβ production . acute alcohol treatment during the tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> stimulation resulted in a decreasing trend in ifnβ production in monocytes but this did not reach statistical significance .

considering that chronic alcohol consumption in humans often involves sustained alcohol exposure, we next evaluated the effects of prolonged alcohol treatment on ifnβ production. monocytes were exposed to  <dig> mm alcohol for  <dig> days followed by tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> ligand stimulation. the alcohol concentration in the supernatant was measured using the analox alcohol analyzer  and ranged from  <dig> mm to  <dig> mm over the 7-day period . this result is in accordance with our previous study where we reported that alcohol concentrations vary between  <dig> to  <dig> mm  <cit> . to rule out the possibility that prolonged alcohol treatment has any adverse effect on cell viability, we performed an mtt assay  and found no difference in the viability of alcohol -naïve and -treated cells as shown in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  recently, it has been shown that alcohol  does not influence the human peripheral mononuclear cells viability when either incubated for  <dig> hours or  <dig> hours and our results support this finding  <cit> .

here we found that prolonged alcohol treatment alone did not have any affect on baseline ifnβ production . however, we found significant attenuation of both tlr8- and tlr4-induced ifnβ production in prolonged alcohol-treated monocytes at  <dig> hours . inhibition of ifnβ production was sustained in tlr4-stimulated cells even after  <dig> hours . these data suggested that in the presence of prolonged alcohol treatment, ifnβ production is decreased in monocytes whether induced by tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> stimulation. to further assess the mechanisms of alcohol-induced inhibition of ifnβ production, we evaluated the mrna levels of ifnβ and found that both tlr <dig> and tlr4-induced ifnβ mrna levels were decreased in monocytes after prolonged alcohol treatment . these data suggested that prolonged alcohol treatment inhibits type i ifn induction via tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> mediated pathways and affects ifnβ mrna levels. we also evaluated the affect of alcohol on tlr <dig>  and tlr <dig>  receptors and found no significant differences in alcohol-exposed cells  both at mrna  or protein levels . this was consistent with our previous finding where we showed that alcohol has no effect on tlr <dig> expression  <cit> . this data indicates that alcohol doesn't interfere with receptor expression but might exert its effects on downstream signaling pathways.

induction of tnf alpha via tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> stimulation is inhibited by acute but enhanced by prolonged alcohol treatment
blood monocytes contribute to systemic immune responses and represent the source of inflammatory cells recruited to different tissue sites. here we tested the hypothesis that acute and chronic alcohol regulates the monocyte cytokine production profile in response to tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> stimulation. both lps, a tlr <dig> ligand, and cl <dig>  a tlr <dig> ligand, induced production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tnf alpha in monocytes isolated from healthy volunteers . we found that co-administration of alcohol as an acute alcohol challenge with tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> ligand resulted in a significant inhibition of tnf alpha production . this was consistent with previous studies from our and other laboratories on inhibition of lps-induced tnf alpha induction by acute alcohol both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> .

next, monocytes were exposed to alcohol for  <dig> days at a physiologically relevant concentration , which had no adverse effects on cell viability . chronic alcohol treatment alone induced minimal but statistically significant tnf alpha production and robust tnf alpha production was elicited at  <dig> or  <dig> hours by tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> stimulation . in contrast to the effects of acute alcohol, prolonged alcohol treatment significantly augmented both tlr <dig> and tlr4-induced production of tnf alpha in human monocytes . the increase in tnf alpha protein was mirrored by the mrna upregulation in monocytes after  <dig> days of alcohol treatment in response to tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> stimulation compared to alcohol naïve cells .

the anti-inflammatory cytokine, il- <dig>  is increased by acute alcohol in response to tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> stimulation
pro-inflammatory cytokine production, such as tnf alpha, is counterbalanced by il- <dig> induction, an anti-inflammatory cytokine in monocytes  <cit> . here we found that acute alcohol treatment significantly upregulated tlr <dig> and tlr4-induced il- <dig> production in human monocytes . the increased il- <dig> production in acute alcohol exposed monocytes was consistent with the attenuation of tlr <dig> and tlr4-induced tnf alpha production . this result suggests the role of il- <dig> in the attenuation of tlr8- or tlr4- induced tnf alpha after acute alcohol treatment. finally, we assessed il- <dig> production after prolonged alcohol treatment. while there was a slight tendency for increases in il- <dig>  there was no significant change in tlr <dig> or tlr4-induced il- <dig> production at the protein  or mrna levels  in alcohol treated cells.

discussion
the immunomodulatory effects of alcohol use have been described in various clinical settings including bacterial and viral infections as well as in post-trauma and post-surgical recoveries  <cit> . increased activation of the inflammatory cascade was found in chronic alcoholics with liver disease where blood monocytes produced increased levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tnf alpha  <cit> . while inflammatory cytokine activation has been investigated in several conditions related to alcohol consumption, little is known about the effects of alcohol on the induction of anti-viral immune mediators.

in this study, we investigated the effects of acute and prolonged alcohol on human monocyte responses to tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> ligand stimulation and evaluated anti-viral , pro-  and anti-inflammatory  cytokine production. our novel data indicate that ifnβ production in response to tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> stimulation was significantly attenuated in monocytes exposed to alcohol. these data suggest that alcohol, regardless of the length of exposure, has inhibitory effects on type i ifn production in monocytes. our data further demonstrate that the effects of prolonged alcohol are opposite on type i ifn induction and inflammatory cytokine induction within the same cell type. prolonged alcohol exposure inhibited ifnβ production while it increased tlr8- and tlr4-induced tnf alpha production. finally, we show that the previously described anti-inflammatory effect of acute alcohol on tnf alpha production extends to tlr8-induced tnf alpha induction and involves simultaneous induction of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, il- <dig>  in human monocytes.

toll-like receptors are evolutionarily preserved receptors for recognition of danger signals  <cit> . nucleic acid sequences in viruses are recognized by tlrs expressed in the endosome including tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> that sense single-stranded rna and tlr <dig> that sense bacterial dna  <cit> . lps, a component of gram-negative bacteria, activates tlr <dig> expressed on the cell surface  <cit> . human monocytes express a broad repertoire of functionally active tlrs including tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  <cit> . we found that tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> ligand stimulation resulted in the induction of both ifnβ and inflammatory cytokines in human blood monocytes. ligand activation of tlr <dig> recruits myd <dig>  a common tlr adapter, and triggers activation of irak1/ <dig> kinases and the traf6/tak <dig> complex leading to the activation of the ikk kinase complex that in turn induces inflammatory cytokines, tnf alpha or il- <dig> or phosphorylation of irfs that induce production of type i ifns  <cit> . tlr <dig> signaling involves recruitment of the adaptor molecules myd <dig> and/or trif, each activating different downstream pathways to induce inflammatory cytokines via nf-κb or type i ifns via irf activation, respectively  <cit> . considering the differences between the tlr8- and tlr4-induced signaling, our data suggest that alcohol likely modulates multiple components of these signal transduction pathways. indeed, modulation of nf-κb by acute and chronic alcohol has been extensively studied in the past in lps-stimulated monocytes  <cit> .

the inhibitory effect of alcohol on type i ifn induction is likely to be a clinically significant finding considering the large number of studies that demonstrate a clinical correlation between alcohol use and impaired anti-viral immune mechanisms  <cit> . excessive alcohol consumption is known to predispose individuals to secondary infections such as hcv, hiv and bacterial infections  <cit> . we found that the inhibitory effects of alcohol occurred both at the ifnβ protein and mrna levels. as we found no significant changes in tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> mrna or protein after alcohol treatment, we speculate that alcohol interferes with some of the intracellular signaling elements required for ifnβ gene induction in monocytes. recently, zhao et al have described the role of ppar-gamma in limiting ifnβ production via targeting irf <dig> in macrophages  <cit> . in line with this report, alcohol has been shown to activate ppar-gamma in rats  <cit>  and mice  <cit> .

previous studies from our and other laboratories showed that ifn-induced signaling pathways are also inhibited by alcohol in blood monocytes as well as in liver cells  <cit> . phosphorylation of stat- <dig> and stat- <dig> was inhibited by acute alcohol suggesting not only ifnβ production but even type i ifn-induced downstream events could be impaired by alcohol exposure  <cit> . recently, we showed that chronic alcohol upregulates microrna - <dig> in macrophages  <cit>  therefore, it is reasonable to argue that alcohol might be targeting other mirnas to limit ifnβ production. in fact, mir-26a, -34a, - <dig>  and let-7b are shown to directly regulate ifnβ in human and macaque cells  <cit> .

we found that acute and prolonged alcohol had opposite effects on both tlr8- and tlr4-induced tnf alpha production in human monocytes. our laboratory has extensively studied the opposite effects of acute and prolonged alcohol on tlr4-mediated signaling pathways and identified irak-m, irak <dig>  ikk phosphorylation and nf-κb activation as common targets of acute and chronic alcohol with opposite effects.

we showed that the inhibitory effects of acute alcohol are mediated by alcohol- induced inhibition of nf-κb activation due to decreased phosphorylation of ikkα and ikkβ in lps-stimulated human monocytes  <cit> . based on this information and the fact that tnf alpha induction involves nf-κb activation whether induced via tlr <dig> or tlr <dig>  our observation of decreased tnf alpha in acute alcohol-exposed tlr <dig> stimulated monocytes suggests that nf-κb inhibition is a likely mechanism for inhibition of tlr8- induced tnf alpha induction by acute alcohol. an additional mechanism that likely contributes to decreased tnf alpha production after acute alcohol is the increased induction of il- <dig> observed in tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> stimulated alcohol-exposed monocytes in our experiments. the increased tnf alpha induction by tlr <dig> ligand in chronic alcohol-exposed monocytes might involve nf-κb activation and reduced irak-m by chronic alcohol is also permissive to increase tnf alpha production  <cit> . finally, induction of mir- <dig> after chronic alcohol treatment results in increased tnf alpha production via increasing tnf alpha mrna stability  <cit> , which is likely the mechanism not only for tlr4- but also tlr8-induced tnf alpha production in monocytes.

lastly, alcohol treatment  modulates cytokines that negatively regulate tnf alpha. previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that acute alcohol increases il- <dig>  tgfβ and il- <dig> production in human monocytes  <cit> . in a mouse model, acute alcohol has been shown to inhibit tlr- induced inflammatory responses via the p <dig> and erk1/ <dig> pathway  <cit> . while our or others studies found no obvious decrease in the level of anti-inflammatory cytokines after prolonged alcohol exposure in monocytes or in vivo, there is an obvious imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines with the presence of increased tnf alpha and no increase in il- <dig> in human monocytes after prolonged alcohol treatment. thus, it is possible that prolonged alcohol exposure targets multiple signaling molecules to augment tnf alpha expression.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, to our best knowledge, our data show for the first time that alcohol modulates tlr8-induced monocyte functions both at the level of anti-viral and inflammatory mediator production. our observations suggest that alcohol exposure, whether acute or prolonged, impairs type i ifn responses to viral and bacterial pamps. the reduced type i ifn production occurs in the face of increased pro-inflammatory  cytokine production in monocytes with chronic alcohol exposure suggesting that prolonged alcohol changes the immune balance of monocyte activation.
