BACKGROUND
the gbgt <dig> gene was first described in canine kidney cells by haslam et al. in  <dig>  <cit>  and three years later cloned in human  <cit> . gbgt <dig> mrna expression has been observed in a broad variety of human tissues including small and large intestines, placenta, and ovary  <cit> . gbgt <dig> encodes the forssman synthetase . although differential methylation of gbgt <dig> has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease  <cit>  and gbgt <dig> nonsense and inactivating missense mutations have been identified that produce a truncated or enzymatically inactive enzyme  <cit> , it is not understood how gbgt <dig> expression is regulated.

forssman synthetase catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of forssman  antigen that involves a series of sequential attachments of monosaccharides catalyzed by the glycosyltransferase ugcg, b4galt <dig>  a4galt, b3galnt <dig>  and finally gbgt <dig> . however, it is unknown how and to what extent the expression levels of not only each one of these glycosyltransferases but also of the respective glycosidases such as naga  affect the biosynthesis of fs antigen in the cells. likewise, it has not yet been investigated whether the expression levels of these glycosyltransferases and glycosidases differ between cancer and normal cells.

fs antigen is a pentaglycosyl ceramide  terminated by galnac and belongs to the globo series of glycosphingolipids . gsl comprise a heterogeneous group of membrane lipids formed by a ceramide  backbone covalently linked to a glycan moiety: either galactose or glucose to form galactosylceramide  or glucosylceramide , respectively. glccer is the precursor of at least four different series of gsl. among those are the globo series gsl which play roles in various biological processes: they are present within lipid raft microdomains  <cit> , they associate with multidrug resistance  <cit> , with angiogenesis  <cit> , and with malignant diseases  <cit> , with proliferation  <cit> . and serve as receptors for human pathogens  <cit> . only recently, naturally occurring anti-glycan antibodies against globo series gsl have been identified the levels of which were lower in the plasma of ovarian cancer patients compared to healthy women  <cit> , an observation that allows discriminating cancer patients from healthy women.

the appearance of fs antigen is controversial. it was thought to be absent in humans and to be expressed exclusively on animal red blood cells  <cit> . this is in contrast to studies demonstrating that fs antigen is present in human cancer  <cit> . svensson and colleagues found the fs gsl expressed also on human erythrocytes  <cit> .

in the present study we  profiled a panel of ovarian cancer and normal ovary surface epithelial cell lines for the expression of gbgt <dig>  naga, and the other glycogenes encoding the glycosyltransferases and glycosidases involved in the biosynthesis of fs,  investigated whether gbgt <dig> expression is regulated through dna methylation and whether the degree of dna methylation correlates with gbgt <dig> expression in cell lines and tissue, and  determined whether gbgt <dig> expression is an outcome predictor in ovarian cancer.

our results show that gbgt <dig> is the most variably expressed gene among the fs-relevant glycogenes and among the investigated cell lines, dna methylation is involved in the regulation of gbgt <dig> expression in ovarian cancer cell lines and tissue, and gbgt <dig> expression does not predict survival.

RESULTS
differential expression of forssman antigen biosynthesis-relevant glycogenes in ovarian cell lines
we investigated whether the expression level of gbgt <dig> differs between ovarian cancer and normal ovarian surface epithelial cells. because the biosynthesis of fs antigen requires multiple glycan-processing enzymes, this investigation also includes the glycogenes encoding the corresponding glycosyltransferases and glycosidases. the biosynthesis pathway of fs pentasaccharide is outlined in figure 1a. to this aim we profiled the transcriptional activity of these  <dig> genes in a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines  and normal ovarian surface epithelium cell lines  using rt-qpcr in concordance with miqe guidelines  <cit> .

the hierarchical cluster analysis of the Δcq values for each glycogene, portrayed as a heat map, produced two branches . one branch clustered eight genes  with generally comparable expression levels among the cell lines, except for the ugcg gene which was expressed at considerably higher levels in both hose cell lines compared with the ovarian cancer cell lines. the other branch clustered three genes  with a wide variation in gene expression levels among the cell lines tested. b3galnt <dig> was lowest expressed in tov112d cells , moderately in igrov <dig> , and highly expressed in the remaining cell lines . a4galt was generally expressed at high levels in all the cell lines , except for a <dig> . gbgt <dig> was highly expressed in both hose cell lines  and in the ovcar <dig> ovarian cancer cell line  but expressed at low levels in the remaining cell lines . cluster analysis also demonstrated that gbgt <dig> branched first in the respective cluster, indicating that gbgt <dig> is the most significantly differentially expressed gene in this cluster among the cell lines, being expressed at low levels in ovarian cancer cells  and at high levels in normal ovarian surface epithelial cells.

the preferential expression of gbgt <dig> in ovarian cancer cell lines was fully confirmed in an additional set of independent experiments . these results showed that gbgt <dig> expression is significantly different among the tested cell lines . gbgt <dig> expression is high  in both hose cells  and in ovcar <dig> cells  and low in a <dig> cells , showing that gbgt <dig> expression is 185-times  lower in a <dig> cells than in ovcar <dig> cells. the comparison of the two normal cell lines  with the panel of ovarian cancer cell lines  revealed a significantly differential gbgt <dig> expression . in contrast to gbgt <dig>  naga  was not differentially expressed among the cell lines. western blot analysis and densitometry data  demonstrated that hose6- <dig>  hose17- <dig> and ovcar <dig> cells display higher levels of gbgt <dig> protein than a <dig>  tov112d, tov21g, and igrov <dig> cells. these data were  largely consistent with the rt-qpcr data.

silencing of gbgt <dig> expression in ovarian cancer cells by dna methylation
we next investigated whether the observed differential expression levels of gbgt <dig> among cell lines correlated with the dna methylation status of its cpg island promoter region. combined bisulfite and restriction analysis  was performed to determine the methylation status within a 217 bp fragment of the cpg island located on chromosome 9: 136038417– <dig>  this cpg island contains  <dig> individual cpg sites spanning 1161 bp, according to the ucsc genome bioinformatics data base . the targeted genomic dna sequence for the cobra assay is located within the cpg island from position +28 bp to +245 bp downstream from the transcription start site  . the results showed substantial levels of dna methylation in the three investigated cpg sites in tov112d, tov21g, and a <dig> cells , consistent with the qpcr and protein data showing significantly reduced gbgt <dig> expression . in contrast, no methylation was found in ovcar <dig> and in both hose cells  which exhibited high levels of gbgt <dig> expression. an intermediate level of methylation was found in skov <dig> and igrov <dig> cells .

bisulfite sequencing was performed to quantify the gbgt <dig> promoter methylation levels in a <dig> , hose17- <dig> , ovcar <dig> , and skov <dig> , and also to determine the extent of methylation across the cpg island fragment within individual dna strands. figure 2c showed that  <dig> % of all cpgs are methylated in a <dig>  whereas only  <dig> % were methylated in hose17- <dig> and  <dig> % in ovcar <dig> cells. the skov <dig> cell line displayed an intermediate 40% methylation of cpgs, preferentially at the first  <dig> cpg sites. bisulfite sequencing therefore showed a strong inverse correlation between gbgt <dig> expression and dna methylation , indicating that the majority of ovarian cancer cells have silenced gbgt <dig> expression through dna methylation.

increased gbgt <dig> expression induced by 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine treatment
we determined whether silenced gbgt <dig> expression in a <dig> cells  can be reversed by 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine  treatment. 5-aza is a dna methyltransferase inhibitor that de-methylates the dna and therefore reactivates or enhances the transcription of genes suppressed by dna methylation  <cit> . we found that 5-aza produced a 15-fold increase in gbgt <dig> expression after 48 h and a 46-fold increase after 72 h in a <dig> cells , which is also reflected on the gbgt <dig> protein level . a 5-aza-induced effect was also observed for skov <dig> cells  though to a lesser extent .

elevated hpa-staining in a <dig> cells after 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine treatment
in order to determine whether the 5-aza-induced increase in gbgt <dig> expression results in elevated presence of fs antigen on a <dig> cells we used hpa -staining as a “surrogate marker” for fs antigen. hpa is a lectin which preferentially binds the fsdi disaccharide  <cit> , the terminal structure of the fs antigen pentasaccharide. flow cytometry analysis data showed increased hpa-staining in 5-aza treated a <dig> cells  which reflects the elevated presence of fs on these cells.

differential dna methylation of gbgt <dig> in ovarian tumor and normal adjacent tissue  data)
we wondered whether the observed differential gbgt <dig> methylation pattern, i.e. largely unmethylated gbgt <dig> in the normal hose cells and hypermethylated in ovarian cancer cells, was also found in primary and recurrent ovarian carcinoma and in normal adjacent tissue. to this aim we analyzed the methylation levels of gbgt <dig> using the publicly accessible data from the cancer genome atlas  ovarian cancer sample set  <cit> . dna methylation at two cpg sites within the gbgt <dig> cpg island promoter, cg <dig>  and cg <dig> , were represented on the illumina infinium humanmethylation <dig> beadchip array . methylation between these two sites was significantly correlated within primary tumor data . within the tcga ovarian tissue dataset, dna methylation data for normal adjacent ovarian tissue were available for a small number  of individuals, of which only four had matched tumor. the levels of dna methylation in ovarian tumors from the tcga dataset varied widely, which was consistent with our findings in the ovarian cancer cell lines. gbgt <dig> methylation levels at both cg <dig> and cg <dig> in adjacent normal ovarian tissues were consistently high . when all normal samples  were compared with all primary tumors samples , no significant difference in methylation at either cg <dig>  or cg <dig>  was found . however, across individuals for which paired tumor and normal-adjacent tissue methylation data was available, cg <dig> was higher in tumors compared with normal adjacent tissue in all four individuals  and this difference was borderline statistically significant  . methylation of cg <dig> was not significantly different between these four matched normal and tumor pairs .

association between dna methylation and expression
we now investigated the dependence of gbgt <dig> expression on dna methylation in tissue samples to translate our cell line-based findings.

integrated analysis of gbgt <dig> dna methylation and gene expression in the tcga ovarian cancer data set showed that dna methylation at cg <dig> was inversely correlated with gbgt <dig> expression in primary tumors, measured using either the huex-1_0-st-v <dig> affymetrix exon array , or the illumina hiseq rna-seq platform  . gbgt <dig> cg <dig> methylation was not significantly correlated with gbgt <dig> exon expression in normal adjacent tissue  in this small sample size analysis. in linear models adjusted for age at pathological diagnosis and clinical stage, cg <dig> methylation was significantly associated with gbgt <dig> expression, measured by the exon array , and rna-seq data . a dose-effect relationship between cg <dig> methylation and gene expression is apparent when gbgt <dig> expression is stratified by dna methylation quartiles . in contrast, cg <dig> methylation did not significantly correlate with gbgt <dig> expression or associate in linear models in any sample type using either gene expression measurement .

discussion
the present study shows that  gbgt <dig> is the most differentially expressed glycogene involved in the biosynthesis of fs antigen and  that gbgt <dig> expression is silenced through dna hypermethylation in ovarian cancer cells and tissue but re-activated by 5-aza treatment. in contrast gbgt <dig>  does not correlate with clinical outcome  in ovarian cancer patients. we therefore conclude that gbgt <dig> expression is epigenetically regulated in ovarian cancer but that it is not a prognostic predictor for survival.

the major finding from the present study is dna methylation is one mechanism by which gbgt <dig> expression is regulated in both ovarian cancer cells and tissue. this is a novel finding and expands on a previous study reporting that gbgt <dig> is differentially methylated and associated with inflammatory bowel disease  <cit> . dna methylation is one out of at least four epigenetic mechanisms by which eukaryotic organisms regulate the transcription of a significant number of genes, and aberrant hypermethylation of cpg island promoters associated with transcriptional silencing is a frequent occurrence in various types of cancer  <cit> . epigenetic silencing is, however, only one mechanism by which gbgt <dig> expression is regulated. gbgt <dig> nonsense and inactivating missense mutations have been identified that produce a truncated or enzymatically inactive protein  <cit> .

interestingly, a correlation between gbgt <dig> repression and dna hypermethylation was notably not only found in ovarian cancer cell lines. a bioinformatical analysis of the ovarian tcga dataset showed a clear-cut inverse correlation between the degree of methylation at the probe closest to the transcription start site and gbgt <dig> mrna expression levels within the tcga primary ovarian cancers, although the degree of gbgt <dig> methylation varied considerably among samples  and levels of gbgt <dig> methylation were also detected in adjacent normal ovarian tissue. notably, however, in the four tcga cases with matched tumor and normal adjacent tissues higher methylation levels were found in tumor samples compared to normal adjacent tissues, being in concordance with our cell line-based observation. the present study is therefore not only the first one addressing gbgt <dig> expression and its regulation in ovarian cancer but also suggest that gbgt <dig> is differentially expressed in cancer and healthy conditions i.e. lower in ovarian cancer patients and higher in normal cells. this observation is consistent with a previous study showing gbgt <dig> mrna expression in various tissues  <cit> .

from a clinical point of view it is interesting whether gbgt <dig> methylation and/or expression levels associated with clinical outcome parameters such as survival and therefore serve as a prognostic factor. however, our ovarian cancer tcga dataset analysis did not reveal an association between methylation or expression levels and survival , indicating that gbgt <dig> methylation or expression levels are not outcome parameters in ovarian cancer.

gbgt <dig> is not the only glycosyltransferase-encoding gene regulated by dna methylation. b4galnt <dig> and st3gal <dig> have been found to be epigenetically silenced in colon and gastric cancer cells and shown to be re-expressed after 5-aza treatment  <cit> . both are involved in the biosynthesis of the blood group carbohydrate sda galβ1-4glcnac) which is abundantly present on normal gastrointestinal tract mucosa cells but decreased on gastric cancers  <cit> . fut <dig> has been shown to be differentially methylated in patients with ulcerative colitis and crohn's disease  <cit> . various genes implicated in the glycosylation of secreted n-linked glycoproteins may also be epigenetically regulate because 5-aza treated ovarian cancer cells displayed altered glycosylation of these proteins  <cit> .

another important finding is that a <dig> cells incubated with 5-aza exhibited an elevated hpa staining. hpa is a lectin from helix pomatia agglutinin that preferentially binds fsdi , the terminal disaccharide  of fs antigen  <cit> , and therefore hpa staining may serve as a “surrogate marker” for fs antigen expression. in this case, this finding together with the 5-aza-induced increase in gbgt <dig> expression suggests that the elevated hpa staining may be a result of the increased gbgt <dig> expression and fs synthesis in these cells. on the other hand, we cannot exclude that 5-aza also affects the expression of glycogenes other than gbgt <dig> that, in turn, produces an “elevated binding” of hpa to glycan structures other than fsdi. the latter may explain the relatively high level of hpa-staining in “mock”-treated a <dig> cells in the respective experiment.

hpa expression has previously been proposed as a determinant for poor prognosis in breast, gastric, and colon cancer  <cit> . given that elevated hpa staining is a result of increased gbgt <dig> expression and that hpa staining is a determinant for poor prognosis also in ovarian cancer, we would expect increased gbgt <dig> expression in cancer cells. the observation that gbgt <dig> expression is lower by trend in ovarian cancer does neither support nor rules out the idea that the hpa-staining may be a prognostic determinant in ovarian cancer. earlier studies have suggested fs antibody titers as disease determinants: high fs autoantibody titers were found in graves' disease and hashimoto's thyroiditis  <cit>  and low were found in patients with cancer of the gastrointestinal tract and breast  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our results identify gbgt <dig> as the most differentially expressed fs-biosynthesis-relevant glycogene among the cell lines investigated and provide evidence that dna methylation at its promoter region is one mechanism by which gbgt <dig> expression is regulated on the transcriptional level in ovarian cancer. this mechanism may explain the observed differential gbgt <dig> expression in earlier studies.
