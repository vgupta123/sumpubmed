BACKGROUND
scarcity of natural resources such as water leads to calamities like drought, which is considered as a major abiotic stress in the flora and fauna world  <cit> . horse gram is a highly drought tolerant legume, whose tolerance capacity is attributed in parts to various pathways like antioxidant and osmolyte biosynthesis, making it sturdy enough to withstand long periods of drought with minimum management  <cit> . its nutritious composition, medicinal properties and indomitable pest resistance makes it a rich yet cheap source of food, fodder, fuel supplement and green manure  <cit> . it has been identified as potential food source for future by the u.s. national academy of sciences  <cit> .

however, information over horse gram genetic resources is scarce compared to other plants. there are only  <dig>  expressed sequence tags  available at ncbi as compared to other legumes like glycine max , cicer arietinum , medicago truncatula , lotus japonicus  and pisum sativum . no genome survey sequences  is available for horse gram as compared to the above mentioned legumes. furthermore, till date there is no data related to global size genomic, transcriptomic or protein biology studies on horse gram. this study is a comprehensive report on transcriptomic analysis of horse gram in response to drought stress.

transcriptome is coding region of the mrna set derived from a genome  <cit> . massively parallel sequencing includes next generation sequencing techniques like  <dig> pyrosequencing/roche, illumina/solexa gaiix, abi/solid, pac biosciences/pacbiors and helicos biosciences/tsms and drs  <cit> . these techniques do not require prior knowledge of genomic sequence and are much advanced in terms of time, cost, labor, amount of data produced, data coverage, sensitivity and accuracy as compared to the orthodox sequencing methods  <cit> .

the estimated genome size of horse gram is 400 mb. genomic-level questions can be addressed through developing informative transcriptome producing huge amounts of data  <cit> . when answering fundamental questions like mechanisms involved or related to a particular trait like drought tolerance, it becomes imperative to draw a conclusion based on a comparative study  <cit> . comparison of plant genotypes differing in their sensitivities towards drought is an inevitable approach to discover natural drought tolerance mechanisms  <cit> . avoiding this, we could miss out some vital information regarding the common and divergent regulatory networks involved in drought tolerance  <cit> . horse gram has inherent drought tolerance trait, still its genotypes display different sensitivities towards drought stress. therefore, we consider horse gram to be a wonderful source for understanding the genetic basis of responses to drought tolerance.

this study describes transcriptome analysis conducted for eight shoot and root tissues of a drought sensitive  and a tolerant  genotype of horse gram under control and drought stress conditions using illumina gaiix. the development of genetic resource for horse gram facilitated functional characterization of transcripts responsive to induced drought stress conditions. creating genetic resources regarding gc content, ssrs markers, genes, pathways and transcription factors associated with depauperate plants like horse gram would augment the relating research programs. our study would possibly create awareness on global scale for betterment of horse gram and other less exploited plants.

methods
tissue sampling, cdna library preparation and illumina sequencing
the seeds of horse gram were obtained from department of plant breeding and genetics, csk hpkv, palampur, india. the shoot and root tissues were collected from control  and 48 h stressed  samples of horse gram plants m- <dig>  and m- <dig> . eight samples  were taken for the present study. v <dig> is the sensitive genotype  while v <dig> is the tolerant genotype . control condition is denoted by ‘c’ while drought stress condition is denoted by ‘s’. sh, stands for shoot and r stands for root tissues. rna extraction was done using iris method  <cit>  from three different biological replicates for each tissue. obtained rna was checked for quality and quantity on bioanalyzer  and  <dig> % formaldehyde agarose gel. the best rna samples having 5 μg of concentration, good quality on gel and rin above  <dig> were chosen for cdna library preparation. illumina truseq rna sample preparation kit v <dig>  was used for library preparation. the prepared libraries were quantified on qubit fluorometer using qubit dsdna br assay kit . the validation insert size in libraries was done using bioanalyzer. these libraries were further loaded onto the flow cell for generating clusters on cluster station using truseq pe cluster kit v5-cs-ga . the flow cell containing clonally amplified clusters was loaded onto the genome analyser iix  and paired-end   was performed.

de novo assembly, sequence clustering and homology search
using casava package, provided by illumina, pe sequence reads of length 72 bp each were generated. quality assessment of reads was done using read quality filtering tool, filter  <cit> . de novo assembling of high quality reads was performed using assembler soapdenovo-trans  <cit> . in order to assemble the reads to obtain high quality assembly contigs, filtered reads were first split into smaller substrings . soapdenovo-trans was run for different k-mer lengths ranging from 19– <dig> bases. k-mer size of  <dig> and  <dig> were found to be best in-terms of number of transcripts produced, average length of transcripts, coverage and n <dig> value. scaffold sequences were obtained by merging two contigs into a single scaffold sequence, which shares the pe reads separated by an average insert length of 200 bp. gapcloser was used to close the gaps emerging during the scaffolding process by soapdenovo-trans. in the first step of hierarchical clustering, clustering and merging was done using cluster database at high identity with tolerance  est with minimum similarity cut-off of 90%  <cit> . in follow-up, tigr gene indices clustering tool  cap <dig>  clustering was run on 90% identity to get the assembled transcripts without overlaps  <cit> . following the hierarchical clustering process, the number of total assembled sequences was reduced. this set of assembled transcript sequences were used to scan against nr protein database using blastx  with the e-value threshold of 10- <dig> <cit> . the contigs/scaffolds that had no sequence similarity among themselves but may belong to the different regions of a single gene were identified using dissimilar sequence  clustering approach  <cit> . the longest sequence with highest bit score from each cluster was taken as the representative sequence. this clustering approach yielded non-inflated representation of total number of unique genes, which would otherwise remain falsely high.

assembly validation and similarity search for assembled transcripts
to estimate assembly accuracy, about  <dig>  experimentally validated horse gram est sequences, reported at ncbi were used to comparatively validate the assembled sequences. these est sequences were searched against the assembled transcripts as the database, using blastn with an e-value threshold of 10- <dig> 

ontology and annotation
assembled transcripts were searched against uniprot databases and associated go, kegg and ec annotations were derived using annot8r  <cit> . annotation was performed with an e-value threshold of 10- <dig> and ten maximum hits were allowed. top hits were considered based on highest bit score and e-value. plntfdb  provides complete set of transcription factors and other transcription regulators of  <dig> different plant species  <cit> . in plntfdb version  <dig>  different protein models and sequences are further categorized into  <dig> different gene families. in the current study, data for all  <dig> plant species which consists of  <dig>  transcription factors was downloaded. the assembled transcript sequences  were searched against this database using blastx with an e-value threshold of 10- <dig>  further ds clustering was performed to choose best representatives. agrigo tool was used to identify the enriched gene ontology terms  <cit> . the singular enrichment analysis was performed at significance level of  <dig>  in all the comparative conditions which used complete assembled transcript unigene go annotations of horse gram as the background reference. the query list contained only the go terms for transcripts having two fold or above differential expression for the given conditions. hyper-geometric statistical test was applied with bonferroni correction method to counterbalance the problem of multiple comparisons.

plant metabolic network  pathways analysis
plantcyc version  <dig>  reference database which hosts more than  <dig> experimentally validated pathways, their catalytic enzymes and genes was used to study the up regulated pathways in drought stress conditions  <cit> . locus ids of the identified unigenes after ds clustering were looked across ncbi and pathways corresponding to four different plant species namely arabidopsis thaliana, glycine max, vitis vinifera and populus trichocarpa were searched in the database.

functional domains search for unknown sequences
the assembled transcripts which did not return any homologous sequence hit through blastx were searched against conserved domain database  using rps-blast at an e-value threshold of 10- <dig> <cit> . this way it was possible to functionally characterize even those sequences whose sequence homology might be missing but presence of conserved functional domain could be identified.

read mapping and transcript abundance  measurement
to measure the expression of all the assembled transcripts rpkm  level measurement approach was used  <cit> . combination of tools seqmap and rseq was used for rpkm measurement  <cit> . the filtered reads from different samples were mapped back individually to the assembled transcripts using seqmap with two mismatches allowed. rseq was used for rpkm based expression measurement on each sample separately. similar transcripts were searched for their rpkm value in each sample. differential expression was calculated for six different comparative conditions by comparing the rpkm values of similar transcript under different conditions. only those transcripts were considered as differentially expressed which exhibited two fold or above differential expression.

gc content analysis and ssrs identification
emboss geecee program was used to calculate the gc content of all the assembled transcripts and simple sequence repeats were found using misa tool  <cit> .

quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
total rna was given dnase i  treatment to remove any dna contamination. first strand cdna synthesis was conducted with 5 μg of the total rna using high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. gene specific primers for qrt-pcr were designed using primer express  <dig>  software. qrt-pcr was performed in three biological replicates on a step one real-time pcr machine  using sybr green qpcr master mix . the conditions for qrt-pcr were kept as; 4 min at 94°c, 40 cycles each of 30s at 94°c, 30s at annealing temperature and 72°c for 30s and a final melting curve analysis was performed. transcript level of all the genes was normalized to an internal reference eukaryotic translation elongation factor gene from horse gram. the relative expression ratio of each gene was calculated using comparative ct value method  <cit> . all primers used in this study are listed in .

RESULTS
comprehensive study on de novo transcriptome assembly of horse gram  was conducted using high throughput sequencing on illumina gaiix . shoot and root tissues of two horse gram genotypes, a drought sensitive  and a drought tolerant  were used for trancriptomic analysis under control and stressed conditions . transcripts obtained were computationally annotated and analyzed. transcripts belonging to drought responsive genes and pathways were identified.

reads generation
for high-throughput sequencing of horse gram transcriptome, pe run of 2× <dig> cycles for each sample was performed on illumina genome analyzer iix platform . casava package was used to convert reads into fastq format. the details of total number of reads obtained for eight different samples are given in table  <dig>  the total number of read pairs obtained before quality filtering were  <dig>   <dig> . no trimming in the read length was done because the average read quality score was found to be greater than  <dig> for all the samples . this shows that the quality of reads obtained was very good. only reads with adapter contamination were filtered out using filter  <cit> . this reduced the read pairs from  <dig>   <dig>  to  <dig> , <dig> 

different samples taken in transcriptomic study of horse gram and total pe read pairs before and after quality-filtering.

de novo assembly, sequence clustering and homology search
for more accurate and sensitive assembly, pe reads with insert length of 200 bp were used. soapdenovo-trans  <cit>  was used for de novo assembly and was run from k-mer size 19– <dig> with read length of 72 bp. the evaluation of assembly on different k-mers was done on the basis of chosen parameters which included total number of assembled transcripts, number and percent of transcripts ≥ 1000 bp, n <dig> value and coverage. k-mer of size  <dig> and  <dig> were found to be the best and were taken together for further analysis . for all the assembled transcripts minimum cut-off length was 100 bp. the total transcript sequences obtained after primary assembly steps were  <dig>  wherein  <dig>  transcripts had length ≥ 1000 bp. the maximum length of the transcript was found to be  <dig>  bp and average transcript length was  <dig> .72 bp with n  <dig> value of  <dig>  bp and high coverage of 295x . sequences with gaps were further scrutinized to map the gap regions with gap filler.

all the steps performed for the de novo assembly of horse gram and calculation of different statistics for each step.

redundancy in the assembled transcripts was removed using two clustering tools namely, cd-hit and 90% similarity cut off and tgicl  <cit> . after hierarchical clustering total numbers of assembled transcripts were reduced from  <dig>  to  <dig>  wherein  <dig>  transcripts had lengths above 1000 bp . maximum transcript length was found to be  <dig>  bp with an average transcript length of  <dig> .2 bp. the n <dig> value was  <dig>  bp with coverage of 568x .

homology search for the sequences obtained after clustering, was done using blastx against protein sequences at non-redundant  databases at ncbi with cut off e-value of 10- <dig> <cit> . significant blast hits were obtained for  <dig>  sequences while no hits were found for  <dig>  sequences. there can be multiple representatives of a single gene or a single gene may have many isoforms so another clustering step known as ds clustering  <cit>  was performed, which curtailed inflation in the number of unigenes that could have occurred otherwise. hence, the total number of transcripts was reduced from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for best group representation. the details of clustered sequences are available as . in the best group representation,  <dig>  transcripts were found to be ≥ 1000 bp with a maximum length of  <dig>  bp and average transcript length of  <dig> .09 bp. the n <dig> value was  <dig>  bp with coverage of 667x . the maximum number of blastx top hits for best group representatives were found with glycine max  followed by vitis vinifera , ricinus communis , populus trichocarpa . however, it also showed homology to a lesser extent with model legume plants, medicago truncatula  and lotus japonicus  and non-legume model plant arabidopsis thaliana  .

validation of assembled sequences against est’s of horse gram
validation of the assembled sequences of horse gram was conducted using blastn analysis performed with an e-value threshold of 10- <dig> <cit> . mis-assemblies and alignment conditions were screened using in-house developed scripts. a total of  <dig>  ests for horse gram were available at ncbi dbest  out of which maximum number  of the ests were submitted in response to drought stress  <cit> . out of  <dig>  ests significant hits were observed for  <dig> ests  while only  <dig> ests  had no hits. maximum width coverage for a single est was  <dig> % and  <dig> ests had coverage greater than 90% while  <dig> ests had coverage greater than 50% validating the precision of the sequence data obtained . no major number was found reporting chimeric arrangement of assembled transcript sequences. this suggests correct alignment and continuity of the sequences obtained. significant hits accounting for  <dig> % of ests in p. kurrooa, 87% in a. thaliana,  <dig> % in p. vulgaris and  <dig> % in l. japonicus have been reported previously  <cit> . the percentages of significant hits with ests obtained for horse gram are higher than those from other legumes and comparable to those from other non-legumes. this validation confirms that all the transcripts from the present study showing significant hits with the available ests of horse gram should belong to drought stress inducible genes.

gc content and identification of short sequence repeats 
gc content is the percentage of guanine and cytosine nucleotides in a genome. usually, gc content ranges between  <dig> to 75% and is affected by genome size, environment and temperature. functional relevance of gc content includes sequence variations in a genome, repeat element distribution, methylation pattern, thermostability and gene density  <cit> . the average gc content for all the assembled transcripts  was found to be  <dig> % . the average gc content of plants like chickpea, soybean and arabidopsis ranges between 40-42%  <cit> . however, higher gc content  has been observed in rice  <cit> . the gc content for horse gram is well within the range.

ssrs or microsatellites are stretches of short nucleotide motifs ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides in length. these are repeated in tandem and are evenly spread across prokaryotic and eukaryotic genome. due to high mutation rates affecting the number of repeat units, ssrs show high length polymorphisms which are easily detected through amplified fragment length polymorphism  techniques. thus, ssrs serve as important molecular marker discovery centers for studying linkage maps of plants, genetic analysis for economically important quantitative traits, plant evolution and breeding studies  <cit> . from  <dig>  assembled transcripts, a total of  <dig>  ssr loci were identified which were found to be highly abundant  in the  <dig>  sequences. out of these, the most prevalent ssr type was tri-nucleotides , immediately followed by mono-nucleotides , then di-nucleotides , tetra-nucleotides , hexa-nucleotides  and penta-nucleotides  . in earlier studies also tri-nucleotide repeat type of ssrs have been found to occur at the highest frequency as compared to other types  <cit> .

details of various ssrs found in horse gram along with their type and occurrence.

functional annotation and classification
functional annotation was conducted using annot8r  <cit> . all the assembled transcripts were compared against nr protein sequences available at uniprot database using blastx algorithm with e-value threshold of 10- <dig> <cit> . the highest scoring hits attained for the sequences were assigned their corresponding functional categories namely go, ec and kegg .

go classification was obtained for  <dig>  transcripts out of a total of  <dig>  transcripts  taken as input . go classification includes biological processes  and molecular functions  as sub-categories. the highly represented groups among biological processes category were metabolic processes , response to stimulus  and cellular processes . under molecular functions category genes for dna binding , catalytic activity  and transferase activity  were observed to be highly represented. in chickpea,  <dig> % of sequences corresponded to metabolic processes,  <dig> % to cellular processes,  <dig> % to response to stimulus,  <dig> % to dna binding and  <dig> % to catalytic activity  <cit> . about 14-18% of the genes in cassava and 12-17% in peanut have been documented under go functional categories  <cit> . in pigeonpea out of  <dig>  sequences,  <dig> belonged to metabolic processes followed by  <dig> sequences for cellular processes and  <dig> sequences for response to stimulus. while molecular functions like dna binding activity retained highest number of  <dig> sequences followed by  <dig> sequences for catalytic activity in pigeonpea  <cit> . it is suggested that the genes showing high representation for all these processes are from metabolically active developing tissues and hence are diverse in function. these processes and activities could be involved in gene regulation and basal defense responses via stress signaling pathways which might be abiotic stress activated or pathogen stimulated  <cit> .

to assess the importance and validity of the identified functions and processes, a go comparison was drawn for horse gram with a common legume glycine max which showed highest homology with horse gram unigenes in blastx results and a non-legume model plant arabidopsis thaliana . under biological processes category, higher numbers of transcripts representing metabolic  and cellular processes  were found in horse gram as compared to other two plants. arabidopsis showed  <dig> % for metabolic and  <dig> % for cellular processes while glycine max showed  <dig> % for metabolic and  <dig> % for cellular processes. however, under molecular functions category the representation of transcripts was more or less the same for all three plants except for structural molecular activity  and oxidoreductase activity  being more represented in horse gram than arabidopsis  and glycine max . in a similar comparison drawn between p. kurrooa, arabidopsis and medicago, p. kurrooa showed higher number of transcripts representing metabolic processes. however, for dna binding and catalytic activity, higher number of transcripts belonged to arabidopsis and medicago <cit> . thus, go analysis suggests that metabolic processes, cellular processes, structural molecular and oxidoreductase activity could be responsible for growth and defense system of horse gram. the above stated highly represented processes and functions remained more or less the same for all the three plants compared, suggesting their indispensable role in over all plant growth, development and defense. this knowledge allows the comparison and transfer of genetic information between plant species.

ec classification was obtained for  <dig>  transcripts while kegg classification was found for  <dig>  transcripts out of the  <dig>  transcripts taken as input. a total of  <dig>  enzyme classes and  <dig> kegg pathways were identified in this study. out of the top  <dig> ec classes analyzed serine/threonine protein kinase  was found to dominate followed by peptidyl prolylisomerase  and phosphoprotein phosphatase  . in transcriptomic analysis of chickpea, sequences primarily belonged to transferases , hydrolases , and oxidoreductases   <cit> . in transcriptomic profiling studies on pigeonpea, 31% of the unigenes belonged to transferases, followed by hydrolases , oxido-reductases , ligases, lyases and isomerases   <cit> . similar categorization of enzyme classes identified for horse gram suggested that  <dig> % transcripts for oxidoreductases,  <dig> % transcripts for transferases,  <dig> % transcripts for hydrolases,  <dig> % transcripts for lyases,  <dig> % transcripts for isomerases and  <dig> % transcripts for ligases. upon analyzing the top  <dig> kegg pathways, dominance was observed for pathways belonging to ribosome  followed by plant pathogen interaction  and plant hormone signal transduction  . similar results have been observed for p. kurrooa where highest number of the assembled transcripts represented serine/threonine protein kinase  followed by plant pathogen interaction   <cit> . in semi-mangrove plant ,  <dig> % of the unigenes identified with  <dig> kegg pathways wherein ribosome, plant pathogen interaction, plant hormone biosynthesis and spliceosome pathways were found to be most represented  <cit> . besides housekeeping functions these enzymes and pathways are expected to be involved in active cellular responses associated with growth, development, differentiation, defense, inflammation, energy metabolism, photosynthesis and apoptosis leading to efficient environmental adaptation  <cit> .

comparative analysis for identification of drought responsive genes
to generate a resource for mining stress responsive genes, representative unigene transcripts showing two-fold and above differential expression were analyzed under control and drought stress conditions in horse gram . the different test conditions taken into consideration have been abbreviated as tc1: transcripts up regulated in shoots of genotype m- <dig> under drought stress condition ; tc2: transcripts up regulated in roots of genotype m- <dig> under drought stress condition ; tc3: transcripts up regulated in shoots of genotype m- <dig> under drought stress condition ; tc4: transcripts up regulated in roots of genotype m- <dig> under drought stress condition ; tc5: transcripts up regulated in shoots of genotype m- <dig> in comparison to genotype m- <dig> under control conditions ; and tc6: transcripts up regulated in roots of genotype m- <dig> in comparison to genotype m- <dig> under control conditions . the first four test conditions  compared the changes in transcript levels of two tissues under stress conditions with that of control conditions within a single genotype. while the last two test conditions  compared the changes in native transcript levels of the two tissues between the two genotypes under control conditions. henceforth, these abbreviated forms will be used for describing the comparative test conditions taken for this study. rpkm expression value and differential expression of all the unigenes under different tcs is given in the .

in tc <dig>   <dig>  transcripts were found to be up regulated,  <dig>  down regulated and  <dig>  remained unchanged whereas in tc <dig>   <dig>  transcripts were found to be up regulated,  <dig>  down regulated and  <dig>  showed no major change under drought stress conditions. in tc <dig>   <dig>  transcripts were observed to be up regulated,  <dig>  were down regulated and  <dig>  remained without any major change in expression level. similarly, in tc <dig>   <dig>  transcripts were found to be up regulated,  <dig>  were down regulated and  <dig>  remained without any major change. to identify the differentially expressed genes in the two genotypes tc <dig> and tc <dig> were taken into account. in tc <dig>   <dig> transcripts were found up regulated,  <dig>  were down regulated and  <dig>  showed no major change in the tolerant genotype compared to the sensitive one. similarly in tc <dig>  <dig>  transcripts were up regulated,  <dig>  were down regulated and  <dig>  remained without major change in the tolerant genotype as compared to the sensitive one. fusarium wilt and sterility mosaic disease had up regulated  <dig> - <dig>  unigenes and down regulated 100– <dig>  unigenes in five genotypes of pigeonpea differing in their sensitivity towards these biotic stresses  <cit> . three genotypes of cassava have also been reported to show up regulation of  <dig> genes and down regulation of  <dig> genes in response to drought stress  <cit> . in m. pinnata higher numbers of genes were found to be up regulated  and down regulated  in the root tissue as compared to the leaf tissue  under salt stress  <cit> . in horse gram higher numbers of transcripts were observed to be up regulated in the root tissue as compared to the shoot tissue within as well as between the two genotypes. root tissue of the tolerant genotype showed the highest number of up regulated transcripts under drought stress conditions. hence, up regulated genes in the root tissue of horse gram could be playing crucial role in its tolerance towards drought.

to find the most represented go category under drought stress, a comparative analysis was done for different tcs based on go terms . it was observed that under biological processes, glycolysis predominated in three test conditions  while response to heat, vegetative to reproductive phase transition of meristem and stamen development were found most represented in tc <dig>  tc <dig> and tc <dig>  respectively. under molecular functions category, protein binding predominated in tc <dig>  tc <dig> and tc <dig>  while molecular function of ubiquitin protein ligase binding dominated in tc <dig> and structural constituent of ribosome was most represented in tc <dig> and tc <dig> 

to relate the drought tolerance of horse gram to its functionally annotated transcripts enrichment analysis was conducted using agrigo singular enrichment analysis module to locate the transcripts for highly enriched drought responsive biological processes and molecular functions at significance level of  <dig>  for all the tcs  <cit>  . all the available go ids of unigenes were used as reference and those which are differentially expressed  in particular tc were taken in the query list. out of all the tcs taken into study highly enriched transcripts for either biological processes or molecular function category were found for all the tcs except tc <dig>  for tc <dig> under molecular function category hydrolase activity  and ion transmembrane transporter activity  was found to be enriched. for tc <dig> among biological processes, response to stimulus  was observed to be highly enriched. for tc <dig> under molecular function category, substrate specific transmembrane transporter activity  was found enriched while under biological processes, response to stimulus  was enriched. for tc <dig>  structural molecule activity  and structural constituent of ribosome  was enriched in shoot of sensitive genotype. while under biological category, metabolic and catabolic processes associated with carbohydrates and alcohol  were found to be highly significant. in tc <dig>  under molecular functions category, structural molecule activity  and structural constituent of ribosome  were found enriched in root of tolerant genotype while biological processes like generation of precursor metabolites, energy , glycolysis , metabolic, catabolic processes associated with carbohydrates, alcohol and small molecules  were found enriched.

in an insectivorous plant sarracenia, hydrolase activity has been found to be highly represented among all the unigenes  <cit> . metabolic processes for metabolites and energy generation have been found to be enriched in m. pinnata and chickpea unigenes  <cit> . changes in glycolysis, kreb’s cycle and electron transport chain have been previously implicated during drought stress in plants  <cit> . these molecules help in timely response to the stimulus and in the maintenance of membrane integrity which is the first line of defense to stress introduction  <cit> . the enrichment of these processes suggests that horse gram derives and maintains its energy requirements during drought stress adaptation through an active demand for metabolites like carbohydrates and alcohol. high representations of these biological processes and molecular functions further suggested active and efficient adaptation by horse gram to the external stimuli.

to assess the important drought responsive enzymes, ec analysis was conducted for all the tcs . unambiguously in all the tcs serine/threonine protein kinase was most represented  followed by ubiquitin protein ligase and peptidylprolylisomerase . however, few other enzymes like histone-lysine n methyl transferase, phosphoproteinphosphatase, peroxidase and rna helicase were also found commonly represented  in all tcs. similarly, important drought responsive pathways were identified through kegg analysis conducted for comparison under different tcs . the pathways found most represented for all the tcs were ribosome , plant-pathogen interaction  and plant hormone signal transduction . these were followed by alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, ribosome, spliceosome, starch, sucrose metabolism and glycolysis. these ranged from 1-3% in abundance. like horse gram, p. kurrooa also showed plant-pathogen interaction  to be highly represented  <cit> . transcriptomic analysis of m. pinnata has also documented maximum transcripts to plant pathogen interaction  from a total of  <dig>  unigenes  <cit> .

plant metabolic network associated with drought tolerance in horse gram
a separate pmn search was conducted to identify and associate the drought responsive transcripts of horse gram with plant metabolic networks or pathways. a total of  <dig> out of  <dig>  unigenes were found to be associated with  <dig> pathways. important pathways were selected from these  <dig> pathways only for transcripts showing two fold or above differential expression. these selected pathways were considered to be up regulated in different tcs . among these up regulated pathways also, only those showing highest differential expression are mentioned under different conditions. in tc <dig>  pathways found highly influenced were of valine degradation , γ-glutamyl cycle  and acetyl-coa biosynthesis . while in tc <dig> gluconeogenesis , sucrose degradation  and pyridoxal 5-phosphate biosynthesis ii  pathways were found most influenced. similarly, in tc <dig> besides valine degradation , glucosinolate biosynthesis  and udp-glucose biosynthesis  pathways were observed to respond significantly. while in tc <dig> purine nucleotides degradation i , flavonol biosynthesis  and co <dig> fixation  were found to be most influenced.

valine degradation in shoots, gluconeogenesis and purine nucleotide degradation pathways in roots were among highly up regulated pathways under stress conditions suggesting their critical role against drought stress in horse gram. amino acids like valine, leucine, isoleucine act as a precursor for the synthesis of polyamines which along with proline produce synergistic osmoprotective effect against drought stress  <cit> . glucosinolates are the nitrogen and sulphur containing compounds derived from amino acids like valine, leucine, alanine. these compounds have been known to be accumulated in response to drought stress conditions  <cit> . simultaneously, catabolic enzymes of these branched chain amino acids  are also activated under stressed conditions to prevent the rise of these bcaa to a toxic level  <cit> .

gluconeogenesis produces glucose from non-carbohydrate sources. normally, no change or down regulation of gluconeogenesis process should be an energy saving measure taken by plants under drought stress. interestingly, up regulation of gluconeogenesis in roots of drought sensitive horse gram genotype only, allows us to hypothesize it as a quick response of this genotype to cope with drought challenge. when shoots of this genotype are unable to maintain a normal homeostasis under stress, roots might perceive the danger and utilize gluconeogenesis pathway to produce enough glucose as energy source for plant. the key enzyme of gluconeogenesis  has been found to be up regulated in drought susceptible genotype of chickpea and down regulated in the leaves of tomato and arabidopsis under drought stress  <cit> .

nucleotide metabolism is known to affect plant growth and development. under drought stress conditions these otherwise normal processes are challenged. therefore, nucleotide biosynthesis as well as degradation has been shown to be implicated in drought stress responses in rice, paddy rice and arabidopsis plants  <cit> .

involvement of other pathways showing high representation in horse gram has also been well implicated under drought stress conditions. under extreme dehydration conditions, some carbohydrates  provide protection to the proteins by forming a hydration shell in lieu of water  <cit> . in a study on arabidopsis, enzymes of udp-glucose biosynthesis  have been implicated in shoot and root growth through cell wall carbohydrate biosynthesis under stress conditions  <cit> . genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, sucrose degradation and gluconeogenesis pathways have been found to be strongly affected in response to drought conditions in vitis vinifera and tomato  <cit> . gamma-glutamyl cycle involves glutathione metabolism which is well known to mitigate the stress levels in plants  <cit> . the variation in phenotypic response to drought stress of these two genotypes of horse gram could be attributed to the influence of various regulatory network pathways mentioned above as has been documented for plants like cowpea and chickpea under biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> .

transcription factors
sequences from different plants for various transcription factors are available at plntfdb  <cit> . these sequences are further categorized under  <dig>  categories. around  <dig>  transcript sequences exhibited similarity to transcription factor, represented by  <dig>  unique transcription factor genes . the most abundant tf families observed in case of horse gram are c3h , bhlh , ap2-erebp  . a comparative study was also conducted for all the tcs . the most abundant tf families observed under stressed condition in the shoot tissue of both genotypes were nac , myb-related , g- <dig> like , and wrky . while in case of roots others remaining the same, c3h and phd  families were an addition. however, the order of abundance varied under different conditions. on comparison, ap2-erebp, myb-related and bhlh were highly abundant in shoot of m- <dig> while c3h, gnat, tig and g- <dig> like were high in shoot of m- <dig>  in case of roots, c3h, phd and bhlh were abundant in m- <dig> while orphans, ap2-erebp and myb-related were abundant in m- <dig>  all these families ranged from 1-8% in abundance in horse gram.

tfs are key regulators of plant growth, development and response systems. they can control a cascade of metabolic reactions and hence alter important agronomical traits in plants  <cit> . from the analysis of tfs in horse gram it can be suggested that the most important and responsive players in defense of horse gram against drought stress are nac, myb-related, wrky, c3h, phd families. these families have been previously shown to act in improving drought tolerance and pest resistance, reducing water loss by regulating stomatal movement, increasing transpiration efficiency, regulating embryogenesis, chromatin mediated transcription and systematic acquired resistance  in plants like soybean, peanut, chickpea and ground nut  <cit> .

unknown genes
no hits were obtained for a total of  <dig>  transcripts in the blastx search. therefore, search for these transcripts was conducted against conserved domain database using rps-blast at an e-value threshold of 10- <dig> <cit> . out of  <dig>  sequences, hits were found for  <dig> transcripts mainly belonging to conserved domain categories . highest occurrence was shown by important domains like large tegument protein ul <dig> ; transcriptional regulator icp <dig> ; extensin-like region  . among the  <dig>  unknown genes of p. kurrooa, conserved domains were identified for  <dig>  transcripts only. in p. kurrooa also, large tegument protein ul <dig> and extensin-like region were among the most represented domains  <cit> . the large tegument protein ul <dig> is a high molecular weight protein  found on capsid surface of herpes simplex virus . it is essential for morphogenesis and protein-protein interaction of virus. icp <dig> is crucial protein of hsv involved in the regulation of viral gene expression for productive infection  <cit> . extensin-like regions are similar to hydroxyproline rich glycoproteins  known to be associated with pollen tube growth, cell wall self assembly and cell extension  <cit> . the presence of these conserved domains suggests critical function of their corresponding transcripts in horse gram for cell wall assembly, protein-protein interaction and pollen growth.

experimental validation of differential expression data by qrt-pcr
in order to validate differential gene expression obtained through rna-seq, a total of  <dig> genes were selected, out of the transcripts having two-fold and above differential expression under different tcs and their qrt-pcr analysis was performed . among the chosen transcripts genes encoding heat shock protein , cysteine proteinase inhibitor  <dig> , 40s ribosomal protein s 19– <dig> , transcription factor bhlh , calmodulin binding factor , dehydrin , dead-box atp dependent rna helicase  have been known to be previously involved in response to abiotic stresses  <cit> . besides these, qrt-pcr was also performed for transcripts encoding for pod storage protein  and eukaryotic translation initiation factor , which were found to be drought-responsive in horse gram in this study. the expression pattern of most of the genes obtained through qrt-pcr data largely corroborated with rna-seq data. however, one transcript  coding for ubiquitin 40s ribosomal protein s 27– <dig> did not exactly match with its rna-seq value . the qrt-pcr analysis confirms that rna-seq approach has provided reliable data regarding differential gene expression of horse gram under drought stress.

CONCLUSIONS
in order to reveal the genetic architecture and response towards drought stress, transcriptomic study was conducted in shoot and root tissue of a sensitive  and tolerant  genotype of horse gram. high quality reads generated with wide coverage presented a comprehensive overview of horse gram at genetic level. attaining substantial number of transcripts with high average length and coverage suggested making of good quality de novo assembly. validation of the obtained unigenes against already known drought responsive ests of horse gram suggested their prominent role under drought stress conditions. functional annotation and validation of horse gram transcripts against other plant species showed a number of known pathways, enzymes, metabolic processes and transcription factors up regulated under stressed conditions. however, a few unknown genes were also found to be significantly responsive to drought stress but their annotation and functional validation demands further investigation. ssr markers obtained from this study can be utilized for molecular breeding programs. identification and characterization of genes responsible for horse gram’s indomitable pest resistance remains a future work to better understand plant-pathogen interactions. this genetic information developed in this study will be very useful for the improvement of horse gram as well as other agricultural important crops.
