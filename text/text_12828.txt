BACKGROUND
human mal <dig>  a  <dig> kda protein with four transmembrane  domains  <cit>  is a member of the mal protein family. the founding member mal  <cit>  resides in lipid rafts  <cit>  and is required in apical vesicle transport  <cit> . the mal family also includes less characterised members, including bene, which is also a raft-associated integral membrane protein  <cit> , plasmolipin, a  <dig> kda proteolipid expressed in compact myelin and epithelial cells  <cit>  and chemokine-like factor superfamily  <dig> , a novel regulator of egf-induced signalling  <cit> . mal <dig> was identified as a partner for tumor protein d52-like proteins through yeast two-hybrid  expression screening of a human breast carcinoma library  <cit> . the mal <dig> protein is now known to be expressed in many epithelial cell types, as well as peripheral neurons, mast cells and dendritic cells  <cit> . in hepg <dig> hepatoma cells, mal <dig> resides exclusively within lipid rafts, and represents an essential component for indirect basolateral-to-apical transcytosis  <cit> , where it shows a highly dynamic subcellular localisation  <cit> . mal <dig> has also been reported to be distributed in both lipid raft and non-raft fractions in primary thyrocytes  <cit>  and pc- <dig> prostate carcinoma cells  <cit> , predicting additional, uncharacterised cellular functions for mal <dig> outside lipid rafts.

the initial identification of mal <dig> suggested its overexpression in breast cancer  <cit> , which is supported by the mal <dig> gene being found at chromosome 8q <dig>  which is frequently gained in breast and other cancers  <cit> . several studies have now identified mal <dig> amplification and/or overexpression in breast cancer  <cit> . overexpression of mal <dig> has also been reported in other cancers, including primary ovarian carcinoma  <cit>  and ascites  <cit> , and pancreatic carcinoma  <cit> , where mal <dig> has since been employed as a discriminator of pancreatic carcinoma versus chronic pancreatitis  <cit> . expression profiling has also indicated mal <dig> overexpression in malignant pleural mesothelioma of the epithelial type  <cit> , and in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  <cit> . immunohistochemical analyses first revealed differential mal <dig> expression in renal carcinomas  <cit> , with this being recently confirmed in chromophobe renal cell carcinoma versus oncocytoma  <cit> .

despite numerous reports of mal <dig> overexpression in breast cancer, little is known about how increased mal <dig> expression may provide an advantage to cancer cells. while mal <dig> cellular localisation and function have been explored in previous studies  <cit> , the only known mal <dig> partners are members of the d52-like protein family  <cit> . interactions between mal <dig> and both d <dig> and d <dig> have since been identified in a large scale y2h analysis  <cit> , which supports further use of the y2h system to analyse mal <dig> function. we therefore carried out a y2h screening of a breast carcinoma cdna expression library  <cit>  to identify novel mal <dig> binding partners. one protein thus identified was mucin  <dig> , a transmembrane protein expressed on the apical surface of epithelial cells  <cit>  and overexpressed in multiple cancers  <cit> , in part through muc <dig> gene amplification  <cit> . like other mucins, muc <dig> protects and lubricates normal glandular epithelia, whereas muc <dig> overexpression in cancer alters many cellular properties, including intercellular adhesion and immune recognition  <cit> . as muc <dig> therefore represented a candidate mal <dig> partner of particular interest, subsequent experiments were performed to confirm mal2/muc <dig> interactions, and examine their significance in breast epithelial and cancer cells. as we will describe, this work identifies a mal <dig> as a cytoplasmic muc <dig> partner which binds muc <dig> in non-lipid raft fractions, and may regulate muc <dig> expression and/or subcellular distribution.

methods
plasmid constructs
bait proteins for use in the y2h system were expressed from the pas2- <dig> vector , and prey proteins were expressed from the pact <dig>  or pad-gal <dig>  vectors. the pas2-1mal <dig> bait construct was obtained by subcloning an ecori-xhoi fragment, representing the entire mal <dig> cdna insert, into the ecori and sali sites of pas2- <dig> vector. for the pas2-1mal and pact2mal constructs, a mal cdna insert was amplified by pcr amplification to introduce a 5' ncoi site, and a 3' xhoi site downstream of the stop codon, which was then subcloned into the corresponding or compatible sites in pas2- <dig> and pact <dig>  constructs including truncated versions of the mal <dig> coding region were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction  using specific primers . for the pas2-1mal2Δn and pact <dig> mal2Δn constructs, primers introduced a 5' ncoi site, and a 3' xhoi site downstream of the stop codon. for the pas2-1mal2Δntm <dig>  pas2-1mal2Δntm <dig>  pas2-1mal2Δntm <dig> and pas2-1mal2Δntm <dig> constructs, primers introduced a 5' ecori site, and a 3' xhoi site downstream of the stop codon. all subcloned constructs were verified by dna sequencing, with pcr-generated inserts being fully sequenced on one dna strand. the pcr <dig> /myc-mal <dig> expression construct has been previously described  <cit> . all constructs encoding d52-like fusion proteins, and the human breast carcinoma cdna library constructed in the hybrizap vector  have been previously described  <cit> .

yeast two-hybrid system and screening
yeast cultures of the saccharomyces cerevisiae hf7c strain were grown at 30°c in standard liquid or solid media, based upon either rich ypd media , or minimal sd medium  for expression library screening and direct interaction testing. for cdna library expression screening, bait  and human breast carcinoma pad-gal <dig> library plasmids were transfected simultaneously into hf7c cells. subsequent screening and the recovery of plasmid dna from yeast cells were carried out as described  <cit> . for the direct testing of interactions, paired baits  and preys  were transfected into hf7c cells as described  <cit> . interactions between baits and preys were assessed by qualitatively determining his <dig> reporter gene activity  <cit> .

antibodies
the bc <dig>  and fitc-bc <dig> antibodies have been previously described  <cit> . rabbit polyclonal c-myc  and cav <dig> antibodies were purchased from santa cruz biotechnology  and bd biosciences , respectively. affinity-purified d <dig> rabbit polyclonal antibody has been described previously  <cit> . peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit and anti-mouse, fitc-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from jackson immunoresearch, inc .

preparation and affinity purification of polyclonal mal <dig> antisera
for the production of sheep antisera, one sheep was injected subcutaneously with  <dig> mg coupled mal <dig> c165-p <dig> peptide antigen on  <dig> occasions, spaced by  <dig> weeks. for the production of rabbit antisera, two rabbits were injected subcutaneously with  <dig>  mg coupled n13-v <dig> and c165-p <dig> mal <dig> peptide antigens on  <dig> occasions, spaced by  <dig> weeks. antisera were affinity-purified using relevant mal <dig> peptides as previously described  <cit> .

human breast cell lines
the mda-mb- <dig> , mda-mb- <dig>  sk-br- <dig> and mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells were cultured as described in the american type culture collection catalogue. mcf-10a cells are described in the american type culture collection catalogue and were cultured as described  <cit> .

derivation of stably-transfected cell lines
the myc-tagged mal <dig> expression construct was stably transfected into mcf-10a cells. cells were seeded at approximately 60% confluence in  <dig> mm dishes and transfected  <dig> h later with  <dig> μg plasmid dna using lipofectamine  <dig> reagent , according to the manufacturer's instructions. after  <dig> h, g <dig> was added to a concentration of  <dig> mg/ml. media were replenished every 2– <dig> days and a g418-resistant mixed population was selected  <dig> days post-transfection. mda-mb- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> breast cancer cells were transfected by electroporation with a muc <dig> cdna containing  <dig> vntr repeats in the pcdna <dig> vector  or the vector alone. stable g <dig> resistant clones were isolated and muc <dig> expression determined by flow cytometry.

preparation of total protein extracts and western blot analyses
cells were harvested in cold pbs, pelleted and washed twice in cold pbs. total cell protein extracts were prepared by resuspending the pellet in sds extraction buffer , which were then briefly sonicated. samples were resolved using sds-page on  <dig> % polyacrylamide gels, and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose filters . protein loading was analysed using ponceau s staining, and filters were blocked overnight at 4°c in 5% skim milk powder in tbs. membranes were washed twice with tbs and incubated with either affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal mal <dig> antisera , affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal d <dig> antisera , bc <dig>  or cav <dig> antibody  in  <dig> % tween  <dig> in tbs, for  <dig> h. membranes were washed  <dig> times in  <dig> % tween  <dig> in tbs, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody   for  <dig> h. blots were washed  <dig> times with  <dig> % tween  <dig> in tbs, followed by  <dig> washes in tbs and antigen-antibody complexes were visualised by western lightning chemiluminescent reagent .

co-immunoprecipitation analyses
mcf-10a cells were grown to 80% confluence in  <dig> mm dishes and washed with cold pbs. for each co-immunoprecipitation, proteins were extracted by scraping cells from  <dig> dishes into  <dig>  ml lysis buffer per dish. for co-immunoprecipitation of mal <dig> and d <dig> proteins,  <dig> mm tris with  <dig> mg/ml saponin  was employed as a lysis buffer  <cit> . for co-immunoprecipitation of mal <dig> and muc <dig> proteins, sds lysis buffer  was employed. protein a-sepharose beads  plus rabbit mal <dig> antisera , either alone or with  <dig> μg/ml synthetic peptides n13-v <dig> and c165-p <dig>  or protein g-agarose beads  plus bc <dig>  were added to cell lysates and incubated on a rotary mixer at 4°c for  <dig> h. beads were washed  <dig> times with  <dig> ml lysis buffer, followed by a final wash with pbs. eluted proteins  were separated using sds-page on  <dig> % polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose filters  for western blot analyses, as above.

immunofluorescent labelling of breast cell lines
cell lines were cultured to near confluence, and harvested by trypsinisation. cells were diluted 3- to 10-fold and cultured overnight on glass coverslips. for immunofluorescent staining, cells were washed twice with pbs, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde supplemented with  <dig> % saponin for  <dig> min at rt. cells were washed twice with pbs, and incubated at rt for  <dig> h with affinity-purified rabbit mal <dig> , d <dig>  antisera or mouse bc2-fitc , in  <dig> % bovine serum albumin  in pbs. primary antibody was omitted in control incubations. cells were washed twice with pbs and incubated with a cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody   in  <dig> % bsa in pbs, for  <dig> h in the dark. cells were washed again and dna was counterstained with  <dig> nm dapi . following  <dig> washes in pbs, cells were mounted in dapco  prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. images were taken using a tcs sp <dig> laser scanning confocal microscope , using a 63× oil-immersion objective and a 4× zoom factor.

membrane fractionation analyses
triton x- <dig> soluble and insoluble fractions were prepared essentially as described  <cit> . cells grown in  <dig> ×  <dig> mm dishes were treated with  <dig> mm methyl β-cyclodextrin  at 37°c for  <dig> min. cells were then rinsed with pbs and lysed for  <dig> min in  <dig> ml  <dig> mm tris-hcl ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig> mm edta, 1% triton x- <dig> at 4°c. the lysate was brought to 40% sucrose in a final volume of  <dig> ml, placed at the bottom of a  <dig> ml tube, and then layered with  <dig> ml 30% sucrose followed by  <dig> ml 5% sucrose, made in the same buffer without triton x- <dig>  gradients were centrifuged for  <dig> h at  <dig>  rpm at 4°c in a beckman sw <dig> rotor. fractions of  <dig> ml were harvested from the top of the tube and aliquots were subjected to western blot analyses.

RESULTS
yeast two-hybrid screening identifies muc <dig> as a putative mal <dig> partner
to identify mal <dig> partners expressed in breast cancer tissue, a y2h screen of a breast carcinoma cdna expression library  <cit>  was performed with a full-length mal <dig> bait. screening  <dig> , <dig> cfu in hf7c cells identified  <dig> hf7c colonies that remained his+ on restreaking on solid sd/-leu-trp-his media. sequencing the corresponding cdna inserts identified  <dig> novel candidate mal <dig> binding partners, of which muc <dig> was most frequently isolated. dna sequencing indicated that all  <dig> muc <dig> prey constructs  encoded n-terminally truncated muc <dig> proteins, which commonly included the sea module, the tm domain and the cytoplasmic tail . testing whether muc <dig>  could reproducibly bind mal <dig> and/or the related protein mal showed that muc <dig> could bind both mal <dig> and mal baits in the y2h system . in contrast, d52-like baits bound mal <dig> prey as previously reported  <cit> , but not mal . since mal and mal <dig> sequences differ in their n-terminal regions  <cit>  and a full-length mal <dig> prey was originally isolated using a d <dig> bait  <cit> , the mal <dig> n-terminal domain  was hypothesised to represent the interaction interface with d52-like proteins. deleting this region abolished interactions with all d52-like proteins tested, but did not affect interactions with muc <dig> , suggesting that muc <dig> and d52-like proteins bind discrete regions of mal <dig> 

derivation of polyclonal antisera which specifically recognise mal <dig> protein
to confirm mal2/muc <dig> interactions in other systems, mal <dig> antisera were generated in two species. polyclonal antisera were generated in sheep and targeted the mal <dig> c-terminus . an n-terminal mal <dig> peptide   <cit>  as well as the c-terminus  were also targeted for polyclonal antibody production in rabbit  <cit> . both peptide sequences are poorly conserved in other mal-like proteins  <cit> . rabbit mal <dig> antisera were employed in western blot analyses of total protein extracts from a panel of human breast carcinoma cell lines, as well as mcf-10a breast epithelial cells. a mal <dig> species of the predicted molecular weight of  <dig> kda was detected in extracts from mda-mb- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cell lines stably transfected with a muc <dig> expression vector  or the corresponding vector , and from mcf-10a, sk-br- <dig> and mcf- <dig> cells. this is in agreement with previous detection of the  <dig> kda mal <dig> species in other cell types  <cit> . higher molecular weight mal <dig> species were also detected , and are likely to represent glycosylated mal <dig> forms  <cit> .

co-immunoprecipitation of muc <dig> and mal <dig> from mcf-10a/myc-mal <dig> cells
co-immunoprecipitation analyses were used to confirm interactions between mal <dig> and muc <dig> proteins in mcf-10a breast epithelial cells, stably-transfected with a myc-tagged mal <dig> construct . protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with either muc <dig>  c-myc or mal <dig> antisera, the latter in the absence or presence of mal <dig> peptides. immunoprecipitated proteins were then subjected to western blot analyses with muc <dig>  mal <dig>  c-myc and d <dig> antisera. these analyses demonstrated that muc <dig> monoclonal antibody immunoprecipitated muc <dig> and co-immunoprecipitated mal <dig>  as demonstrated by both mal <dig> and c-myc antisera, and that c-myc and mal <dig> antisera immunoprecipitated mal <dig> and co-immunoprecipitated muc <dig> . interactions between muc <dig> and mal <dig> proteins were also reproducibly demonstrated in mcf- <dig> cells and muc1-transfected mda-mb- <dig> cells . as expected, d <dig> co-immunoprecipitated with mal <dig> and c-myc antisera, and interestingly with muc <dig> as well , suggesting that muc <dig> and d <dig> may form a multi-molecular complex with mal <dig>  inclusion of mal <dig> peptide abolished immunoprecipitation of mal <dig> and co-immunoprecipitation of both muc <dig> and d <dig> .

mapping the mal <dig> region required for muc <dig> binding
the differential binding of d52-like proteins and muc <dig> to mal2Δn and mal  suggested that d <dig> and muc <dig> bind different mal <dig> domains. to map the muc <dig> binding domain in mal <dig>  additional n-terminal mal <dig> deletion mutants were constructed, to serially delete the four mal <dig> tm domains . the tm domains were specifically targeted as the muc <dig> tm domain was encoded by all prey constructs isolated . interactions were detected between muc <dig> prey and mal2Δn bait, but not mal <dig> bait additionally lacking the first tm domain . another putative mal <dig> partner identified through y2h screening showed detectable interactions with mal2Δntm <dig>  indicating that the lack of muc <dig> binding to mal2Δntm <dig> was not artifactual . these analyses therefore indicate that the first mal <dig> tm domain  is required for muc <dig> binding . similar deletion mapping experiments involving muc <dig> indicated that the minimal mal <dig> binding region was contained within the shortest muc <dig> prey  identified through yeast two-hybrid screening  .

mal <dig> and muc <dig> co-localise in the cytoplasm of breast carcinoma cells
the intracellular localisation of mal <dig> in breast cancer cells was determined using indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, and compared with that of muc <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  sk-br- <dig> and muc1-overexpressing mda-mb- <dig> cells showed punctate distributions of mal <dig> and muc <dig> throughout the cell cytoplasm, with partial co-localisation. in mcf- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cells, mal <dig> was similarly detected throughout the cytoplasm, while muc <dig> was concentrated towards the cell periphery, and showed only partial co-localisation with mal <dig>  these results indicate that mal <dig> and muc <dig> co-localise within the cytoplasm, regardless of the predominant site of muc <dig> localisation. furthermore, muc <dig> overexpression in mda-mb- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cells did not alter mal <dig> distribution in these cells .

mal <dig> and muc <dig> are present in lipid raft fractions in human breast carcinoma cells
mal <dig> has consistently been found in lipid raft-containing membrane fractions in hepatoma hepg <dig> cells  <cit>  as well as in human thyroid epithelial cells  <cit> . we therefore examined the distribution of mal <dig> and muc <dig> in triton x-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions from breast carcinoma cell lines. following centrifugation to equilibrium in sucrose density gradients, the distributions of mal <dig> and muc <dig> was compared in fractions 2– <dig>  which include triton x-100-insoluble lipid rafts, and fractions 8– <dig>  which include triton x-100-soluble cytoplasmic proteins and cell membranes. the distribution of the mal <dig> partner d <dig> was also determined, and compared with that of caveolin- <dig> , a known lipid raft protein  <cit> . muc <dig> was detected in both triton x-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions when endogenously expressed in sk-br- <dig> cells  and exogenously expressed in mda-mb- <dig>  and mda-mb- <dig> cells , with muc <dig> being predominantly detected in lipid raft fractions in mda-mb- <dig> cells . in mda-mb- <dig>  and mda-mb- <dig> cells , muc <dig> was weakly detected in soluble fractions only. mal <dig> was detected in both soluble and insoluble fractions in all cell lines examined . the d <dig> protein was predominantly detected in soluble fractions but weakly detected in insoluble fractions in most cell lines . as expected, cav <dig> was exclusively detected in lipid raft fractions .

the effect of cholesterol depletion on muc <dig> and mal <dig> distributions was examined by treating sk-br- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cell lines with mβcd. in sk-br- <dig> cells, mβcd treatment rendered muc <dig>  mal <dig> and cav <dig> virtually undetectable in fractions 2– <dig> . the apparent disappearance of cav <dig> from sk-br- <dig> fractions after mβcd treatment is consistent with cav <dig> expression being reported as undetectable in whole sk-br- <dig> cell extracts  <cit> . in mda-mb- <dig> cells, mβcd treatment reduced muc <dig>  mal <dig> and cav <dig> detection in the same fractions, which was accompanied by increased detection in triton x-100-soluble fractions , further supporting co-distribution of muc <dig> and mal <dig> within lipid rafts. we then carried out -immunoprecipitations of muc <dig> and mal <dig> from pooled soluble and insoluble membrane fractions from mcf-10a/myc-mal <dig> cells. both mal <dig> and muc <dig> were detected in insoluble fractions , yet mal <dig> antisera co-immunoprecipitated muc <dig> from pooled soluble fractions only . the ability of mal <dig> antisera to co-immunoprecipitate muc <dig> from fractions 5– <dig> despite low muc <dig> concentrations supports an association between mal <dig> and muc <dig> in triton x- <dig> soluble fractions.

increased mal <dig> expression leads to increased cell surface expression of muc1
interactions between muc <dig> and mal <dig>  together with previous data showing mal <dig> involvement in basolateral-to-apical transport  <cit>  suggested a role for mal <dig> in localising muc <dig> to the cell surface. the effect of ectopic myc-mal <dig> expression on muc <dig> subcellular localisation was therefore compared in parental and mcf-10a/myc-mal <dig> cells. as shown in figure 9a, mcf-10a/myc-mal <dig> cells showed a dramatically elongated morphology relative to the parental cell line, which did not reflect a change in differentiation status, as assessed using neuronal and epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers . increased detection of glycosylated mal <dig> in both raft and non-raft fractions from mcf-10a/myc-mal <dig> cells was also accompanied by increased muc <dig> detection across all membrane fractions . comparing the sub-cellular localisations of these proteins using confocal microscopy revealed an accumulation of muc <dig> at the periphery of mcf-10a/myc-mal <dig> cells compared with parental cells, which incompletely co-localised with mal <dig> . taken together, these data show that ectopic myc-mal <dig> expression in mcf-10a/myc-mal <dig> cells expands the plasma membrane domain, and increases muc <dig> detection at the cell periphery.

discussion
mal <dig> was first identified through its expression in breast carcinoma and interactions with d52-like proteins within the y2h system  <cit> . we therefore undertook a y2h screen to identify mal <dig> binding partners expressed in human breast cancer tissue, which identified a number of novel putative binding proteins, including muc <dig>  muc <dig> represented a candidate partner of particular interest, given the fact that it is overexpressed in cancer types where mal <dig> overexpression has also been reported, and as muc <dig> overexpression contributes to cancer progression through a number of mechanisms  <cit> . interactions between human muc <dig> and mal <dig> proteins are also broadly consistent with the previously reported interactions between the yeast signalling mucin msb <dig> and the tetraspanin protein sho <dig>  <cit> . subsequent results collectively identify mal <dig> as a novel cytoplasmic muc <dig> partner, and a possible regulator of muc <dig> expression and/or subcellular distribution. it is striking to note that mal <dig>  a chromosome 8q <dig> amplification target, has now been shown to bind muc <dig> and d <dig>  both of which are amplified and/or overexpressed in breast and other cancers  <cit>  strongly suggesting that these proteins have co-operating functions in cancer cells.

while a recent study by kinlough et al.  <cit>  indicated that palmitoylation is the dominant feature modulating muc <dig> recycling to the plasma membrane, the mechanisms by which muc <dig> is targeted and maintained at the plasma membrane are not fully understood. since ectopic myc-mal <dig> expression in mcf-10a cells was associated with increased muc <dig> detection at the cell periphery in the present study, mal <dig> may play a direct or indirect role in muc <dig> targeting. interestingly, mal <dig> incompletely co-localised with peripheral muc <dig> in mcf-10a/myc-mal <dig> cells, which supports previous findings that altering mal <dig> expression can alter cargo accumulation distant to the predominant site of mal <dig> expression  <cit> . however, ectopic myc-mal <dig> expression also produced an apparent expansion of cell surface domains in mcf-10a cells, which may also contribute to increased muc <dig> detection at the cell periphery. similar observations have been made in a previous study where mal overexpression altered the morphology of mdck cells, by seemingly expanding apical cell surface domains through increased apical delivery  <cit> . finally, we also noted that ectopic mal <dig> expression produced an increase in muc <dig> detection across triton x-100-soluble and -insoluble protein fractions in mcf-10a/myc-mal <dig> cells, indicating that myc-mal <dig> may positively regulate muc <dig> expression. this may also lead to increased peripheral muc <dig> detection. while it remains to be determined whether mal <dig> can alter muc <dig> distribution in other cell types, the broad expression of mal <dig> within epithelia  <cit>  is consistent with mal <dig> contributing to muc <dig> targetting under physiological conditions. it will also be of interest to examine whether mal <dig> can similarly regulate muc <dig> secretion.

if mal <dig> similarly regulates muc <dig> expression and/or distribution in cancer cells, increased mal <dig> levels could alter cancer cell biology in several ways. increased muc <dig> localisation at the cell surface could reduce intercellular adhesion and promote invasiveness  <cit> , and increased mal <dig> expression would thus be expected to have adverse significance in cancer cells. accordingly, mal <dig> has been included within a gene signature of poor prognosis in breast cancer  <cit> , and mal <dig> overexpression was associated with resistance to doxorubicin therapy in breast cancer patients  <cit> . mal <dig> overexpression might also reduce cytoplasmic muc <dig> accumulation, which has been indicated to be an adverse finding in breast and ovarian carcinomas  <cit> , tumor types which also overexpress mal <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, suppression of muc <dig> expression in a pancreatic cancer cell line reduced these cells' metastatic potential, and was accompanied by reduced mal <dig> levels  <cit> . further direct analyses are therefore required to determine whether mal <dig> and muc <dig> levels are positively correlated in cancer types commonly expressing these proteins, and whether mal <dig> expression is significantly associated with cell surface expression of muc <dig> in cancer cells.

the present study also provides the first report that muc <dig> localises within lipid raft fractions in breast carcinoma cells, and raises the possibility that some of muc1's signalling functions  <cit>  may occur within lipid rafts. previous studies reported that muc <dig> in t-lymphocyte cell lines was insoluble in cold triton x- <dig> and associated with low density membrane fractions  <cit> , yet kinlough et al.  <cit>  showed muc <dig> from mdck cells was fully soluble in triton x- <dig>  the reported differences in muc <dig> solubility may be due to cell specific differences in membrane composition and their selectivity for detergents, as reported by schuck et al.  <cit> , or alternatively muc <dig> may not reside in lipid rafts in all cell types. we demonstrated associations between muc <dig> and mal <dig> in triton x- <dig> soluble fractions, in agreement with muc <dig> and mal <dig> being predominantly detected in non-raft fractions in all cell lines analysed, which was also noted for the mal <dig> partner d <dig>  while we were unable to determine whether mal <dig> and muc <dig> associate within lipid rafts, our results indicate that mal <dig> associates with muc <dig> and potentially other proteins outside lipid raft membrane microdomains, as indicated for other tetraspanins  <cit> , and highlights the fact that mal <dig> may have independent functions within and outside lipid rafts.

our analysis of mal <dig> partners has also indicated that mal <dig> may represent a multifunctional transmembrane adaptor protein, capable of binding more than one partner simultaneously. we noted that both mal <dig> and d <dig> co-immunoprecipitated with muc <dig> in the present study, despite the fact that direct interactions between muc <dig> and d <dig> were not detected in the y2h system. independent interaction domains for mal2/muc <dig> and mal2/d <dig> binding were also indicated by the mal <dig> n-terminal domain being required to bind d52-like proteins, yet the first tm domain was required for binding muc <dig>  correspondingly, d52-like proteins did not bind mal, whose n-terminal sequence is poorly conserved with respect to that of mal <dig>  <cit> , yet muc <dig> bound both mal and mal <dig> in the y2h system. these results therefore predict shared and isoform-specific functions for mal-like proteins, through shared and discrete binding partners.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has identified mal <dig> as a novel cytoplasmic muc <dig> partner and a potential regulator of muc <dig> subcellular distribution. mal2/muc <dig> interactions were detected in triton x-100-soluble membrane fractions, indicating that mal <dig> has specific functions within non-raft membrane compartments in breast cancer cells. since mal <dig> is known to be amplified and overexpressed in breast and other cancers, it is striking that mal <dig> has now been shown to bind two proteins, muc <dig> and d <dig>  which are also amplified and/or overexpressed. based on these results, and a previous study highlighting the co-amplification of mal <dig> and d <dig> genes in breast cancer  <cit> , it will be interesting to examine whether mal <dig> and muc <dig> are commonly amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer, and whether mal <dig> expression is significantly associated with cell surface expression of muc <dig>
