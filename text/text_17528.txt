BACKGROUND
mammalian gene expression requires the accurate excision of introns and ligation of exons from the pre-mrna by splicing, and approximately 95 % multi-exon genes undergo alternative splicing in human  <cit> . alternative splicing contributes to proteomic diversity and organismal complexity because isoforms can have different functions or have non-functional forms to fine-tune the regulation and expression levels of one gene product.

splicing has been a target of therapy for diseases . there are genetic diseases with mutations located near splice sites that cause abnormal splicing such as familial dysautonomia. in this case, a mutation occurred  <dig> base downstream from exon  <dig> of ikbkap gene inhibits inclusion of the exon. attempts have been made to increase the inclusion of the exon by chemical compounds such as kinetin and rectas  <cit> . there are also diseases that may not have mutations at splice sites, but can be cured by interfering with the splicing process. for example, in order to compensate for the loss of the functional smn <dig> gene, the therapy of spinal muscular atrophy intends to increase the expression of smn <dig> gene by enhancing the inclusion of a normally skipped exon  <dig>  which is necessary to produce a functional transcript of smn <dig> gene  <cit> . another example is one of the therapy strategies of duchenne muscular dystrophy , which is to induce the skipping of exons mutated to be poison exons in the dystrophin gene  <cit> . other possible target disorders of this exon-skipping strategy include pseudo-exon diseases  <cit> , which are diseases caused by an emergence of an exon in the intronic regions due to genetic mutations that create a de novo splice site.

our group developed tg <dig>  a specific clk  family inhibitor   <cit> , and identified that tg <dig> was able to increase the skipping of a mutated exon  <dig> of the dystrophin gene, and increased the expression of this gene at the protein level  <cit> . this study opened the possibility of treatment of dmd with tg <dig>  and we further identified a patient whose mutated exon  <dig> can be enhanced skipping by tg <dig>  whereas none of the wild type exons are affected by tg <dig>  <cit> . advance in knowledge of the features present in tg <dig> sensitive exons would be very useful for application in personalized subscription of splicing modulators, but this has been obstructed by the intricate mechanism of splicing and the fact that tg <dig> targets rna indirectly. the direct targets of tg <dig> are clks, which phosphorylate sr proteins . they have different rna target sequences  <cit> , and the precise rules of how phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of multiple sr proteins affect splice site selection has not been clarified yet .

in this study we set out to find a rule that can help us understand which exons will be affected by tg <dig> treatment. recently, barbosa-morais et al.  <cit>  suggested that the outcome of splicing events is determined more by the cis-elements  than the trans-environment , performing cross-species experiments with human and mouse. this prompted us to design a comparative transcriptome analysis of human and mouse to identify sequence features that make exons responsive to tg <dig>  comparative studies in human and mouse produced many fruitful results in splicing  <cit>  suggesting that these genomes are similar enough, but at the same time we know that there are many sequence variations. we focused on this difference between the genomes to understand what kind of variations in sequence would gain or lose the response to tg <dig>  assuming that the responses to an artificial product by different organisms are probably not conserved.

in this study we performed rna-sequencing  to evaluate the response to tg <dig> in human and murine skeletal muscle cells. we observed that the general response to tg <dig> in terms of direction and scope in human and mouse is similar, likely to reflect the fact that the trans-factors that tg <dig> interferes with are conserved. however we found multiple exons with high sequence similarity but different response to tg <dig> between human and mouse. assuming that the difference in response may originate from slight differences in the splicing cis-elements, we proceeded to characterizing sequence features, and found that tg003-sensitive exons are short, have few splicing factor binding sites and have weak polypyrimidine tracts.

RESULTS
validation of rna-seq data
in order to investigate the tg <dig> sensitive exons in the two species, we performed rna-seq on human skeletal muscle cells  and mouse c2c <dig> cells treated with 20 μm of tg <dig> or no treatment  for 4 h. the numbers of mapped reads and mapping rates are summarized in additional file 1: table s <dig>  to quantify the change in splicing, we calculated Δψ, which stands for difference  in percent spliced in , and measures the difference in the inclusion rates  between the two conditions . in order to confirm the effect of tg <dig>  we looked at clk <dig> and clk <dig> exon  <dig>  which we have consistently observed response to tg <dig> in different types of cells  <cit> . rna-seq reproduced the effect of tg <dig> in clks in our samples as did rt-pcr .fig.  <dig> tg <dig> is a general skip enhancer both in human and mouse. a rna-seq data identifies splicing changes in formerly known tg <dig> sensitive exons. rna-seq data was inputted to sashimi-plot for graphical representations. numbers of junction reads calculated by our method are shown at the junction position. the black boxes below represent the exons and the arrows indicate the direction of transcription. ψ and Δψ values are calculated on the right. b

tg <dig> is a splicing modulator with an orientation to skip enhancement both in human and mouse
next we tried to characterize the effect of tg <dig> to alternative exon-skipping events in general. we calculated the Δψ values for all  <dig> and  <dig> annotated alternative exon-skipping events in human and mouse ensembl database, respectively. we observed a slight negative shift in the distribution of Δψ values compared to the baseline fluctuation of Δψ values , both in human and mouse, indicating that tg <dig> is a general skip enhancer, and the ratio of skip-enhanced  to inclusion-enhanced  was remarkably similar between human and mouse .

we next investigated the conservation of response to tg <dig> at the level of individual alternative exon-skipping events. to determine this we made a subset of  <dig> sequence-conserved exon-skipping events from all the annotated exon-skipping events in human and mouse . these events had on average  <dig>  % sequence similarity over  <dig>  % of the exonic region. we took  <dig> events that had sufficient expression in both species and filtered out events that had inconsistent tg <dig> effects between two replicates in either of the species, which left us with  <dig> events. for each event, we classified events into skip , inclusion  and no effect  for human and mouse respectively, and grouped each event into one of the nine categories as shown in fig. 1d. the number of events in the categories that have exons with conserved response to tg003; “human-skip mouse-skip”, “human-inclusion mouse-inclusion”, and “human-no effect mouse-no effect”, were higher than expectation values which were calculated under the assumption that there is no conservation of tg <dig> effects. the differences between observed values and expectation values were significant with chi square test .

virtual massive mutagenesis mimicked by species-comparing transcriptomic analysis
the previous results showed that the general response to tg <dig> is conserved, possibly reflecting the fact that the trans-factors that tg <dig> works through is generally conserved, but there were several exons that did not respond in the same manner . in order to find the rules that make an exon responsive to tg <dig>  these pairs of exons would be most informative because they respond differently though there is only small differences in the sequence.

we focused our attention on human skip-enhanced splicing events and expanded our comparison set to all possible internal mouse exons. the schematic of the analysis is shown in fig.  <dig>  we first constructed a set of human skip-enhanced splicing event set with stricter criteria. we ensured that the level of gene and junction expression are sufficiently high, and obtained splicing events with Δψ ≤ − <dig>  that also passed t test with p value < <dig> . this left us with  <dig> human tg <dig> skip-enhanced splicing events as our starting set. we searched for homologous exons in all internal mouse exons, and obtained  <dig> human skip-enhanced splicing events with mouse homologous exons. we calculated the Δψ values for the mouse internal exons , and the distribution of the Δψ values of these pairs of splicing events are shown in fig. 3a . we grouped the mouse splicing events depending on their response to tg <dig> as shown in fig. 3b. we confirmed the rna-seq data of the representative cases by rt-pcr , which reproduced the response to tg <dig> as was observed by the rna-seq data . we also confirmed representative cases by rt-pcr from the group of exons which were skip-enhanced in both species  by tg <dig> as well as the group of exons which were skip-enhanced only in the mouse events identified in a separate analysis .fig.  <dig> schematic of species-comparing transcriptome analysis. flow chart of the process determining human tg <dig> skip-enhanced exons and its counterpart mouse homologous exons. squares represent public annotations, rounded squares represent our rna-seq data, oval circles represent manipulations. dark gray squares with cut sides show that there was a filtering process. numbers on the side indicate how many events were left after the manipulations

in order to examine our hypothesis that the differential results were obtained due to changes in cis-element, and not trans-environment we selected dennd4c from the group and cloned the human dennd4c  exon 26– <dig> and mouse dennd4c  exon 29– <dig>  and cross-species transfected the minigene reporter. the results showed that human dennd4c exon  <dig> were skip-enhanced even in the mouse trans-environment of c2c <dig> cells, when the mouse endogenous dennd4c did not respond to tg <dig> . mouse dennd4c exon  <dig> did not respond to tg <dig> in the human trans-environment of hek <dig> cells, when the human endogenous dennd4c exon  <dig> were skip-enhanced by the treatment of tg <dig> . these results suggested that the difference in response to tg <dig> originates in the difference in sequences.fig.  <dig> difference in response to tg <dig> is derived from difference in sequence and not trans-environment. left rt-pcr of endogenous mouse dennd4c exons 28– <dig> and transfected human dennd4c exons 26– <dig> in pegfpc1-human-dennd4c-e29– <dig> transfected c2c <dig> cells. right rt-pcr of endogenous human dennd4c exons 25– <dig> and transfected mouse dennd4c exons 29– <dig> in pegfpc1-human-dennd4c-e29– <dig> hek <dig> cells. after transfection both experiments were treated with 50 µm of tg <dig> for 4 h before harvest



polypyrimidine tract tends to be weaker in tg <dig> skip-enhanced exons
we then tried to identify the sequence features that determines whether the exon responds to tg <dig>  we constructed a set of all homologous pairs of exons that were both insensitive to tg <dig> as a control, and did the following comparisons.  comparison between human tg <dig> skip-enhanced exons and mouse homologous tg <dig> insensitive exons that were identified in the previous section.  comparison between the control set of homologous human and mouse tg <dig> insensitive exons if there were any significant differences in comparison a.  comparison between human skip-enhanced exons used in a and human insensitive exons used in b.  comparison between mouse insensitive exons used in a and mouse insensitive exons used in b. we expected that the four comparisons together would reveal the true determinants of tg <dig> response. we quantified the following features for every exon; exon length, number of eses , number of esss , strength of 5′ splice site and 3′ splice site , intron length, 5′ splice site of upstream introns and 3′ splice site of downstream introns, which are known as contributing factors for the outcome of splicing .

figure  <dig> shows the distribution of scores of the four groups of exons in box plots, and values used are summarized in additional file 5: table s <dig>  additional file 6: table s <dig>  and graphical representations of upstream introns are shown in additional file 7: figure s <dig>  there were two notable types of features. one type of the feature is that the feature scores are significantly different in both comparison c and d; found in the comparisons of exon length, number of eses, number of esss. the other is that the feature scores are significantly different in comparison a but not in b; found in the comparison of polypyrimidine tract score.fig.  <dig> sequence features comparisons between different exon sets identify characteristics of tg <dig> skip-enhanced exons. box plots of scores of sequence features of control homologous exon pairs  and human tg <dig> skip-enhanced and their insensitive mouse counterpart exon pairs . median is shown by bold horizontal line and boxes are drawn between the third quartile  and first quartile . outliers are either three times interquartile range or more above the third quartile, or three times interquartile range or more below the first quartile, and are not shown in the plot. the maximum and minimum are shown with the whiskers.  indicates p value < <dig> , and  p value < <dig> ,  p value < <dig> , calculated by wilcoxon rank sum test



as to the first type of features, the results from comparison c suggest that short exon length, few number of eses and few number of esss are important prerequisites for exons to be responsive to tg <dig>  but the results from comparison d show that the features are present in tg <dig> insensitive exons, suggesting that these features are not sufficient for an exon to be responsive to tg <dig> 

the second type of feature, which showed significant difference in comparison a is what seemed to be the determinant of tg <dig> response, that is, “weak” polypyrimidine tract. the fact that there was no significant difference from comparison b suggests that this difference is not due to species difference. however the fact that there was no significant difference in comparison c suggests that weak polypyrimidine tract is not a determining factor in every exon, but likely becomes a determining factor in exons which are short and have few splicing factor binding. we also observed that the insensitive mouse exons that are homologous to human exons have significantly stronger polypyrimidine tract , which seems to suggest that short exons with few splicing binding sites are likely targets of tg <dig> as long as the polypyrimidine tract is not too strong.

in addition, we noticed that downstream introns were significantly longer in tg <dig> insensitive exons that were homologous to human tg <dig> skip-enhanced exons than in the control tg <dig> insensitive exons . however, there was no tendency for human tg <dig> skip-enhanced exons to be shorter than human control tg <dig> insensitive exons .

box plots of homologous exon pairs that are both skip-enhanced by tg <dig> show similar tendency, and importantly polypyrimidine tract is not strong compared to those of their human homologous counterpart exons .

skip-enhanced exons are enriched within the groups of exons that have weak polypyrimidine tracts and few splicing factor bindings
in the previous section we observed that human exons that are skipped by tg <dig> are short and have few number of splicing factor binding, and among those, we found that polypyrimidine tract strength is critical in the decision by the splicing machinery whether to skip the exon or not. in order to confirm that this trend holds for human exons that are not necessarily homologous to mouse exons, we focused on all  <dig> human annotated exon-skipping events that were sufficiently expressed and assigned sequence feature scores. we grouped exons depending on the length, number of positive and negative splicing factor binding sites, and polypyrimidine tract score, and observed the distribution of the  <dig> skip-enhanced events  by tg <dig> that we defined previously . the detailed results are summarized in additional file 9: table s <dig>  in the groups of short exons with few splicing factor binding sites, we observed a clear trend that groups of exons with weaker polypyrimidine tract are more enriched with tg <dig> skip-enhanced exons . especially for the group of “exon length <  <dig>  ess <  <dig>  ese < 5”, strong association between low polypyrimidine tract scores and high enrichment of tg <dig> skip-enhanced exons were observed . these properties were weakened in a group with exons with relatively large numbers of ese sites; 5 ≤ ese <  <dig> . these graphs also suggested that too weak polypyrimidine tract  makes the exons tg <dig> insensitive rather than skip-enhanced. we also observed enrichment in groups of exons with strong polypyrimidine tracts in short exons with high number of esss , which suggests that for exons that do not satisfy all of the characteristics , other rules remain to be discovered.fig.  <dig> groups with weak polypyrimidine tracts are more enriched with tg <dig> skip-enhanced exons. a decision tree model of tg <dig> skip-enhanced exons. boxes are colored according to their enrichment level with the color code shown at the bottom. b bar graph of enrichment in the four groups of polypyrimidine tract strength in exons with short , few splicing factor binding .  indicates p value < <dig> , and  p value < <dig> ,  p value < <dig> , calculated by hypergeometric test



discussion
in this study we found some rules that can help us understand which exons will be affected by tg <dig> by a comparative transcriptomic analysis approach. we showed that tg <dig> skip-enhanced exons are short exons with few splicing factor binding sites and have weak polypyrimidine tracts. tg <dig> is a clk family inhibitor and is known that clk <dig> phosphorylates the sr proteins  and phosphorylated sr proteins are known to enhance exon inclusion by binding to exonic elements  <cit> . therefore the fact that tg <dig> skip-enhanced exons have few eses is at first counterintuitive. however recent research  <cit>  suggests that sr proteins work synergistically and competitively, and it is more reasonable that the effect of tg <dig> is more dramatic on exons that have fewer opportunities for compensatory activity by other factors that enhance exon inclusion.

the polypyrimidine tract is rich with pyrimidine nucleotides, especially uracil, located about 5– <dig> base pairs before the 3′ end of the intron to be spliced, and associates with many protein factors such as the u <dig> small nuclear rna auxiliary factor  <dig>  and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein . we found that the polypyrimidine tract strength is one of the key determinants of tg <dig> action, which agrees well with past research that showed splicing enhancers stimulated u2af <dig> recruitment to pre-mrna with weak splice sites  <cit> . when the polypyrimidine tract is rather weak for the binding of u2af <dig>  the exon depends more on the splicing factors binding to the ese, and the inhibition of sr proteins by tg <dig> results in exon skipping . to further explore the possibility that weak u2af <dig> binding to the polypyrimidine tract is mediating the exon skipping effect of tg <dig>  we compared splicing changes in u2af <dig> knock down  cells and our tg <dig> treated cells. the rna-seq data of u2af <dig> kd cells was obtained by shao et al. and was deposited in ncbi sra with accession number srr <dig>  <cit> . we listed commonly expressed genes among the u2af <dig> kd dataset and our current dataset, and took the overlap of the skip-enhanced exons of the commonly expressed genes in the two dataset. we obtained  <dig> exons which were skip-enhanced by both tg <dig> treatments and u2af <dig> kd . this number was almost twice larger than the expected value:  <dig>  which was calculated under the assumption that effects of tg003-treatment and u2af <dig> kd were independent. this difference was statistically significant  with chi square test. the fact that u2af <dig> kd and tg <dig> treatment enhance skipping of a similar set of exons supports our hypothesis that tg <dig> affects exon-skipping via changes of interaction between u2af <dig> and polypyrimidine tract.fig.  <dig> model of mechanism of tg <dig> exon skip enhancement. model of mechanism of tg <dig> exon skip-enhancement. we showed that tg <dig> skip-enhanced exons have weak polypyrimidine tract, which is known to be bound by u2af <dig>  some exons require support from other splicing factors for splicing reaction. treatment of tg <dig> might result in exon skipping by the loss of the support



besides, the mutation found in the duchenne patient, who was sensitive to tg <dig>  was located in an ese of exon  <dig> of dystrophin gene, which has a weak polypyrimidine tract, as we previously reported  <cit> . when we strengthened the polypyrimidine tract of the mutated exon  <dig>  the skip-enhancing effect of tg <dig> was weakened .

in evolutionary terms, treatment to artificial products such as tg <dig> is an event that has never occurred in the history of evolution and so it is no surprise that evolution did not prepare different organisms to act in the most fitted way to small chemical compounds. also the combinatorial nature and functional redundancy of splicing factors may have permitted wild sequence variation through evolution while still preserving the same splicing outcome. this brings an important point to strategies in developing drugs, which is that mouse models and murine cells may not be the best model for splicing drug analysis. paying attention to intronic sequence as well as the exonic sequences is important even if the default splicing pattern is the same.

identifying target sequences of chemical compounds that interfere with splicing is difficult. in contrast to rna-binding proteins, where methods such as hits-clip  offer a reliable way to identify binding sequences of the protein of interest, there is no tangible way to “clip” out the target sequence of a chemical compound such as tg <dig> that mildly affects many key splicing regulators. however, our comparative transcriptomic approach successfully identified key factors which determine the sensitivity to tg <dig>  we obtained this result through sequence analysis and did not need to go through extensive characterization of tg <dig> target proteins. although more research is needed to precisely predict the target exons of tg <dig> by sequence inspection, our method proved to bring insight into the features of target sequence of compounds without prior knowledge of the target proteins of the compound.

CONCLUSIONS
we used a comparative transcriptomics analysis approach to identify sequence features which lead exons to be skip-enhanced and shed light on the mechanism of tg <dig> splicing modulation . our work contributes to the field of developing splicing drugs by bringing in this method as well as by calling attention to the fact that splicing events of different species respond differently to compounds even if the default splicing pattern is similar and exonic sequence conserved. our approach is applicable to other splicing modulators and comparison with more than two species may enable examining even finer details of the target sequence features. learning the target sequences of each splicing drug is useful since many patients who have mutations that can benefit from splice-modulation do not have the same mutation. for example, nishida et al.  <cit>  identified two patients of dmd whom may benefit from tg <dig>  and these two patients had different mutations in different exons, and there may be more patients who we do not know yet that tg <dig> may be able to help. characterization of the target sequences of multiple splicing modulators would enable offering customized splicing drugs to patients whose desired splicing modulations may differ in each case.
