BACKGROUND
avicennia officinalis is an obligate halophyte that has evolved both morphologically and physiologically to thrive in saline conditions  <cit> . multicellular salt glands are found on a. officinalis leaves that help to secrete excess salt, which is one of the key adaptations leading to salt tolerance of these plants  <cit> . some studies have shown that salt secretion is an energy dependant process  <cit> , while others have indicated that it can occur through exocytosis  <cit> . although a large number of studies have been conducted on the structure of salt glands  <cit> , only a few were regarding their function  <cit> . therefore, studies such as identification of genes that are specifically expressed in salt glands will contribute significantly towards resolving mangrove salt gland function.

over the last decade many techniques have been developed to identify genes that are specifically or preferentially expressed in the tissue of interest  <cit> . subtractive hybridization  is one such tool  <cit> , which has been widely used in various organisms including plants  <cit> . despite several transcriptomic studies carried out to identify genes responsible for salt tolerance in other mangroves such as bruguiera and aegiceras  <cit> , the molecular mechanisms regulating salt secretion have not been established so far. the mangrove salt glands occur primarily on the leaf epidermis. hence, the use of isolated epidermal peels that are salt gland-rich will increase the probability of identifying genes expressed preferentially in the glands  <cit> . therefore, sh technique could be exploited to identify genes that are expressed in salt gland-rich tissues of the mangrove a. officinalis.

in addition to salt secretion, production of osmolytes  <cit>  or specialized proteins such as late embryogenesis abundant  proteins has been shown to protect macromolecules in the cells under stress  <cit> . a special class of lea proteins  known as dehydrins has been shown primarily to play important roles in alleviating salt and other abiotic stresses through their protective action by binding to macromolecules  <cit> . dehydrins are intrinsically unstructured proteins that contain three conserved motifs: y, s and k and are divided into five subgroups  <cit> . each subgroup has been identified to play a role in response to a specific abiotic stress condition  <cit> . mangroves such as avicennia marina have been shown to contain dehydrins  <cit> . nevertheless, the role of dehydrins in mangrove salt glands has not been adequately understood yet. although, dehydrins have been identified from mangroves such as avicennia marina, their occurrence in salt glands and role in salt secretion have not been well explored.

in this study, we have identified differentially expressed genes in salt gland-rich leaf tissues of avicennia officinalis using sh technique. we have generated a predicted functional gene interaction map of a. officinalis salt glands using the identified ests. additionally, quantitative rt-pcr validation of several ests that are preferentially expressed in the salt glands compared to mesophyll tissue has also been carried out. here we report characterization of a dehydrin gene  identified from the sh analysis. its expression pattern and response to salinity and drought stress treatments were studied in a. officinalis. we present data suggesting the abiotic stress-mitigating function of aodhn <dig> by growing e. coli cells expressing aodhn <dig> under salinity and drought stresses. taken together, our data suggest that aodhn <dig> plays an important role in salt and drought stress remediation in a. officinalis.

RESULTS
classification of differentially expressed ests and expression analysis of selected ests
from the subtracted cdna library, we identified  <dig> ests. most of the ests identified could not be annotated based on function, hence they were classified as unknown and were omitted from further analysis. among the annotated ests,  <dig> showed high e-values and upon removing the duplicates,  <dig> unique ests were obtained. these were then grouped under several categories  based on predicted functions .figure  <dig>

the major classes of genes obtained from sh corresponded to metabolism , stress response , signal transduction , transcription factor  and transporters  . genes involved in lipid, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolic pathways were identified. among the stress responsive classes of genes, those involved in protein recycling, namely, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme and 26s proteasome regulatory subunit were abundant . the transporter genes identified included aquaporins, atp-binding cassette  transporter family, vacuolar atp synthase subunit and plasma membrane h+-atpase. several kinase genes, including casein kinase, serine/threonine kinases along with gtpase were identified in the signal transduction class. nac domain-containing protein  <dig>  transcription factor r2r <dig>  f-box  <dig>  salt-inducible zinc finger are some of the transcription factor genes that were identified in transcription factor class.

tissue-specificity of expression of the  <dig> selected ests was verified by qrt-pcr . abc transporter and ribosomal protein s <dig> showed more than 10-fold abundance in salt gland-rich tissue compared to mesophyll tissue. a dehydrin gene identified from sh  showed more than 6-fold increase . of these, dehydrin is a gene with a possible function relevant for abiotic stress tolerance. hence, it was a preferred gene for further studies. the remaining ests, namely, leucine-rich repeat receptor, 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase, 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase  and aquaporin showed ~5-fold higher expression in the salt gland-rich tissue. r2r <dig> transcription factor, thioredoxin h and atp citrate lyase showed about 3- to 4-fold higher expression in the salt gland-rich tissue. expression analyses of other ests which showed no significant differential expression are provided in additional file  <dig> 

functional gene-network analysis of the ests identified from subtractive hybridization
an interactive revigo  graph that indicates the functional network of the identified ests was generated  <cit> . the overview of this graph shows a functional gene network in salt gland-rich tissue generated against arabidopsis cdna library. at the center of the network, a tight cluster of interaction between hydrolase, atpase and transmembrane transport activity is depicted . transmembrane transport activity seemed to be coupled with atpase and hydrolase activities. ligase activity is seen further down the gene network, especially the activity of ubiquitin-protein ligase. although extensive transmembrane transport and hydrolase activities seem to be occurring in a narrow-range, transferase activity, nucleic acid binding and sequence-specific dna binding transcription factor activities were also observed.figure  <dig>

arabidopsis and  poplar cdna libraries were used to generate the go terms. bubble size indicates the frequency of the go term. highly similar go terms are linked by edges in the graph, where the line width indicates the degree of similarity.



similarly, the interactive graph developed by comparison with poplar cdna database also highlights atpase, hydrolase and transmembrane transport activities . a tight cluster of these three activities was observed but with lower intensity. in parallel, tiny clusters of nucleic acid binding and metal ion binding activities were observed. magnesium ions, alkali metal ion, potassium ion, cation binding activities were major ion binding clusters. however, sequence-specific dna binding, nucleotide-, nucleoside- and atp-binding were included in the nucleic acid binding clusters. an additional small binding cluster of phosphotransferase that are involved in kinase activity was also observed.

cdna and genomic dna sequences of aodhn1
subtractive hybridization of a. officinalis led to the identification of an est  that showed homology to avicennia marina dehydrin <dig> . the coding sequence of aodhn <dig> is 573 bp and the corresponding genomic sequence is 679 bp, because of the presence of an intron  . the cdna sequence stretch coding for a single uninterrupted polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids was identified by in silico translation of the sequence corresponding to aodhn <dig>  with a deduced molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. a nuclear localization sequence  rrkk has been identified towards the c-terminus of aodhn <dig> suggesting that it could be a nuclear-localized protien . also, the location of the intron has been identified in the genomic dna sequence . the predicted two-dimensional structure of the dehydrin proteins using psipred revealed a major unstructured region and two possible α-helices . additionally, the three-dimensional structure of aodhn <dig> generated using itasser confirmed the presence of the unstructured region along with two α-helices .figure  <dig>

classification of aodhn <dig> as a group ii lea protein
sequence alignment with group ii lea proteins of other plant species showed that aodhn <dig> belongs to ysk <dig> sub-class of dehydrins . the amino acids from  <dig> to  <dig>  correspond to the y segment, while amino acids from  <dig> to  <dig> correspond to the s segment, and there are two k segments stretching from amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig>  because this dehydrin possesses one y, one s and two k segments, it is named as the ysk <dig> sub-group . only the domain-specific regions  show consensus between aodhn <dig> and other dehydrins . aodhn <dig> shows a high similarity index of 84% with amdhn <dig> and both the dehydrins were found to be closely related based on phylogenetic analysis .figure  <dig>

characterization of aodhn1
tissues collected from two-month-old seedlings that were not exposed to salt were used for tissue-specific expression analysis. the highest expression of aodhn <dig> was observed in the leaves compared to roots  and stems . in situ hybridization studies from leaves of two-month-old a. officinalis seedlings confirmed abundant expression of aodhn <dig> in salt glands . expression kinetics of aodhn <dig> was tested in both roots and leaves of a. officinalis seedlings upon salt treatment . a 10-fold increase in expression levels of aodhn <dig> in the roots was seen after 8 h while a 2-fold increase was seen in the leaves after 48 h of salt treatment.figure  <dig>

leaf discs from two-month-old seedlings  were chosen to study the regulation of aodhn <dig> by abiotic stresses . drought treatment for 1 h and 2 h showed a 2- and 6-fold increase respectively, in the expression of aodhn <dig>  however, abscisic acid  and salt treatments did not affect the expression of aodhn <dig> up to 2 h.

salinity  and drought  stress response of aodhn <dig> in e. coli bacteria was tested. the e. coli  transfected with pgex-6p-1-aodhn <dig> and empty vector separately, were subjected to 400 mm nacl, 500 mm mannitol and 10% peg treatment. a control study was done without any treatment to check the difference in growth between e. coli cells transfected with pgex-6p-1-aodhn <dig> and empty vector. od <dig> of the bacterial culture was taken at 2 h time intervals after induction of aodhn <dig> expression by iptg-treatment. the e. coli cells expressing aodhn <dig> showed better growth  compared to the control after 6 h  even in the absence of any treatment. with nacl treatment, the cell densities started to show significant differences from 8 h onwards . upon mannitol treatment, e. coli cells expressing aodhn <dig> showed significantly higher growth between 8 h and 10 h . on the other hand, with peg treatment, the difference in growth was apparent from 6 h and lasted up to 9 h . therefore, the protective function of aodhn <dig> protein was demonstrated by the growth advantage conferred under salinity and drought stresses for e. coli cells expressing aodhn <dig> figure  <dig>

discussion
salt secretion is a dynamic and energy dependent process as shown in avicennia species  <cit> . identification of genes that are expressed in salt glands will help in understanding the secretion process. while many genes related to salt tolerance have been identified using sh and transcriptome analysis from the leaves of other mangrove species  <cit> , there have been no attempts to specifically identify the genes that are expressed in salt glands.

a meaningful way of analysing sh data obtained from our experiment was to create a network using revigo, of the ests of a. officinalis against arabidopsis and poplar cdna libraries which would give an overview of functional gene interaction in salt gland-rich tissue  <cit> . this collection of ests from salt gland-rich tissue depicts potential interaction between gene products either with each other or with other molecules in the cell, thereby suggesting the global functional network. the interactive gene ontology  map of the ests with both arabidopsis and poplar cdna libraries suggests that activities of hydrolase, transmembrane transport, nucleotide binding and kinase functions are common in the selected tissue . transmembrane transport includes channels, pumps and transporters, which are important in maintaining ion homeostasis and contribute to salt tolerance. ion transporters like h+-atpases, v-atpases and sos <dig> are known to bring about ionic balance in the cell  <cit> , while transporters like aquaporins stabilize water movement and contribute to osmotic regulation  <cit> . kinases identified from our study belong to receptor-like kinases  which regulate several plant processes such as growth, development and homeostatic mechanisms intrinsic to abiotic stress response  <cit> . this visual outline aids in understanding the possible functional relations of the identified ests from salt gland-rich tissue of a. officinalis.

identification of genes that are highly expressed in salt gland-rich tissue
aquaporins and abc transporters were the major transporters identified in our study. abc transporters are known to transport fatty acids that are required for proper cuticle development in leaves  <cit> . the cuticle plays an important role in maintaining the structural integrity of salt glands. under saline conditions, it becomes important for the salt glands to form a thick cuticular layer to prevent water loss and also diffusion of ions into neighbouring cells  <cit> . the observed high level of expression of abc transporters in the salt gland-rich tissue could explain this in avicennia salt gland cells. aquaporins are known to regulate water movement across the membranes. during drought and salt exposure, aquaporins are known to maintain water balance in the cells  <cit>  and have been shown to play a crucial role in salt secretion of a. officinalis  <cit> . although aquaporins have been identified from the leaves of other salt secretors  <cit> , its precise function in regulating water movement during secretion is not clear. another major class of ests identified was related to metabolic processes. physiological response of the plant is known to be altered due to metabolic changes under salt stress. abiotic stresses usually cause energy deprivation, therefore plants tend to regulate metabolic genes by suppressing genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes of amino acids to conserve energy, and induce genes coding catabolic enzymes of amino acids to provide energy  <cit> . cysteine peptidase identified from our sh study is known to play a role in plant stress response by participating catabolic process  <cit> . ethylene plays an important role during salt stress  <cit>  and ethylene biosynthesis is regulated by the levels of acc oxidase activity  <cit> , which is reported to have a positive effect on salinity tolerance  <cit> . the roles played by these genes in salt secretion and tolerance are still not clear, but the complexity of the underlying metabolic processes is highlighted. our observations provide further evidence to the view that a combined action of different metabolic pathways and active expression of various transporters would have to be occurring in order to maintain cellular homeostasis under stress.

among the class of stress-related proteins, a dehydrin was identified. dehydrins are hydrophilic and highly flexible proteins  that protect cytosolic and membrane proteins by wrapping around them  <cit>  . they seem to function similar to chaperones by stabilizing the protein folding, but dehydrins are much smaller in size and are less complex compared to chaperones. because they belong to iups, it has been quite challenging to determine their precise function through structural studies. however, due to their significant association with protecting proteins against physiological drought, dehydrin was chosen for further examination in our study.

dehydrins have been identified in a wide variety of organisms such as bacteria, chironomid, brine shrimp, nematodes, rotifers and cyanobacteria in response to desiccation  <cit> , and are well-studied in plants for their key role in response to abiotic stress. like group i lea proteins, several studies of specific group ii lea proteins have confirmed that they accumulate during seed desiccation and in response to water deficit induced by drought, low temperature, or salinity  <cit> .

a characteristic feature of group ii lea proteins is the presence of conserved domains such as y, s and k. the k-segment consists of lys-rich 15-residue motif, ekkgimdkikeklpg  <cit> , the y-segment consensus sequence is dygnp  <cit>  and serine rich s-segment contains lhrsgs4– <dig>  which in some proteins can be phosphorylated  <cit> . the orf encoded by aodhn <dig> has a single ‘y’ segment, characterized by the presence of amino acids ‘deygnp’ followed by a serine-rich tract and two lysine-rich ‘k’ segments , and hence it belongs to the ysk <dig> class of dehydrins  <cit> . this is the most abundant class of dehydrins and is known to be induced by aba and drought, but not cold temperatures  <cit> . amdhn <dig> is the only other mangrove dehydrin studied that belongs to ysk <dig> class of proteins  <cit>  while a k-type dehydrin has been identified in rhizophora mucronata  <cit> . however, our study is the first one to report that aodhn <dig> is preferentially expressed in the salt gland cells.

expression and regulation of aodhn1
dehydrins are present in most of the vegetative tissues under optimal growth conditions  <cit> . dehydrins from arabidopsis, craterostigma and citrus have been shown to prevent inactivation of enzymes induced by partial dehydration in vitro  <cit> . although some of the previous reports showed that dehydrins are expressed in all parts of the plants, the present study provides evidence for the preferential expression of aodhn <dig> in a. officinalis salt glands . studies from several plant species indicated that different types of group ii lea proteins are present in various tissue types  <cit> , which explains the preferential expression of aodhn <dig> observed in our study. moreover, the unstructured nature of dehydrins was suggested to allow them to maintain enough water molecules in the cellular microenvironment and thus stabilize the macromolecules during water scarcity  <cit> . since salt glands are the main site of secretion, there will be high concentration of ions in the cells, and hence it is conceivable that the macromolecules within those cells might require the protective action provided by dehydrins. it is therefore not a coincidence to find high level of aodhn <dig> expression in the salt glands as observed in our study. further studies are needed to understand the exact mechanism by which this protective function is conferred within the salt gland cells.

dehydrins are known to accumulate in every tissue upon water deficit imposed by abiotic stresses, such as drought and salinity  <cit> . a group ii lea gene from rice  was found to be specifically aba-responsive and not directly responsive to salt stress  <cit> . while in sunflower, elevated dehydrin transcript levels appeared independent of aba content in late embryogenesis  <cit>  and paf <dig> which belongs to dehydrin family from barely did not respond to exogenous aba treatments  <cit> . hence, we decided to examine if aodhn <dig> has specificity in its response to salinity, drought and aba in a. officinalis leaf discs subjected to these stresses. the observed activation of aodhn <dig> in response to drought  and salt , but not aba treatment  suggests aodhn <dig> responds to the abiotic stresses independently of aba. these observations are in agreement with some of the earlier reports  <cit> .

a majority of group ii lea proteins accumulate in the cytoplasm while some of them have been shown to localize in the nucleus as well  <cit> . our data showed that gfp-fused aodhn <dig> was transiently expressed in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts, the protein was present in both the cytosol and nucleus, which is similar to the observation with amdhn <dig> from a. marina  <cit>  and rab17/dhn <dig> from maize  <cit> . this suggests that aodhn <dig> may function as non-specific protectant by binding to proteins in the cells under stress.

we demonstrated the protective role of aodhn <dig> in e. coli cells expressing the protein and subjected to salinity and drought stress conditions. the significant increase in cell density at 6 h without any treatment compared to control cells without aodhn <dig>  suggests the overall growth advantage provided by the protein. thus, our data suggest that aodhn <dig> may help in stabilizing the cells during abiotic stress conditions even in a. officinalis.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have identified several novel genes that are specifically expressed in the salt gland-rich tissues of a. officinalis. a gene interactive network has been generated based on the ests identified from sh analysis. a dehydrin gene aodhn <dig> that is highly expressed in salt gland cells was identified and cloned. aodhn <dig> was up-regulated in response to drought and salt treatments and was shown to play an important role in alleviating salt and drought stresses. a. officinalis, which is an obligate halophyte, may use this dehydrin protein to protect the cellular components such as enzymes and other macromolecules from dehydration damage caused by physiological drought. the results from our study have helped to identify a key protective protein that represents one of the numerous players in the complex molecular mechanism underlying salt tolerance in mangroves.
