BACKGROUND
reprogramming of human and mouse fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells  has been achieved by the expression of only four transcription factors, oct <dig>  sox <dig>  klf <dig>  and c-myc, referred to as the “four factors”  <cit> . ipscs hold great promise for human disease analyses and therapies, because they are highly similar to embryonic stem cells  in their ability to self-renew and generate all three germ layers. a key question raised by transcription factor-induced reprogramming to self-renewal and pluripotency is how the four factors act to accomplish these changes in the inner and outer cell states.

the morphological changes accompanying the reprogramming of somatic cells to ipscs can be visually identified by alkaline phosphatase staining. the changes in the outer cellular states are further monitored by characteristic molecular markers. in fact, the monoclonal antibodies currently used to define escs and ipscs, including the globo-series glycosphingolipid epitopes ssea- <dig> and ssea- <dig>  and the keratanase-sensitive glycoprotein associated epitopes tra 1– <dig> and tra 1– <dig>  recognize glycan antigens  <cit> . recently, global analyses of glycan signatures for pluripotency on the cell surface were reported, by direct observations of glycan structures by maldi-tof mass spectrometric and nmr spectrometric profiling in escs  <cit>  and indirect observations of lectins by a lectin microarray in stem cells  <cit> . furthermore, the extracellular matrix is also important for controlling cellular states through cell-cell interactions  <cit> .

the inner cellular states also change during the remodeling of the somatic cell transcription and chromatin programs to the es-like state, including the reactivation of the somatically silenced x chromosome, the demethylation of the oct <dig> and nanog promoter regions, and the genome-wide resetting of histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> and  <dig> trimethylation  <cit> . it is particularly important to determine whether the gene expression differences observed between hipscs and the corresponding parental cells actually reflect the differences between these pluripotent cell types, especially between hipscs and escs  <cit> . gene expression signatures were reported for reprogrammed cell lines derived in different labs by various methods  <cit> . in addition, genome-wide mapping of transcription factor targets by chip, combined with microarrays or sequencing methods, can provide a foundation for understanding transcriptional networks  <cit> . expanding the number of transcription factors analyzed by chip-based methods is especially informative in dissecting system level biological processes. in escs, some groups have used new methods for global target mapping to predict the target genes regulated by oct <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog, and these studies revealed the combinatorial occupancy of target gene promoters by these core factors, as well as both autoregulatory and feed-forward transcriptional circuits  <cit> .

here, we applied two methods, rna profiling to uncover gene expression changes, and lectin profiling to survey glycan structure changes, to compare human ipscs and parental somatic cells , including  <dig> cells of nine ipsc lines from four kinds of scs, from amniotic mesodermal, placental artery endothelial, and uterine endometrium sources, and one available hipsc line, mrc- <dig>  the changes were computationally analyzed by a network approach  <cit>  in conjunction with information on the gene binding from previous chip-seq studies and knowledge of the gene functions. the sum of these analyses uncovered novel expression, network, and lectin signatures that are unique to the hipsc lines and differ from those of the parental cells. the following correspondence between the three signatures identified a few glycosyltransferases as novel candidates, due to the characteristic changes of their cellular surface states in hipscs, which shed light on a possible link between the inner and outer cellular states. whether the hipsc signatures described here actually play a functional role in bridging the gap between the two cellular states warrants extensive further investigations.

RESULTS
hipscs descended from different parent scs are distinguishable by gene expression
to determine the gene expression signatures of hipscs, a detailed genome-wide expression analysis was performed to compare ipscs and their parental scs from amniotic mesodermal , placental artery endothelial , uterine endometrium , and mrc- <dig>  cell sources . in total,  <dig> cell samples of  <dig> cell lines  were analyzed in the present study, for a statistical comparison of the hipscs and the parental scs .

unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the gene expression data across the four hipsc lines  and their corresponding parental scs revealed interesting patterns in the gene expression heat map . first, the hipscs were clearly distinguishable from their respective parental scs. this finding was verified by another clustering method with a distinct technique . second, the gene expression profiles of the four hipsc lines were linked to those of their parental scs, while these profiles of the hipscs from different passages were clustered more closely with each other, rather than with those of the hipscs from the corresponding parental scs . in support of these findings, a pearson correlation analysis demonstrated that the gene expression profiles of the hipscs from different passages were more closely related to each other than to the hipscs from the same parental scs . furthermore, the above relationship between the hipscs and the parental scs was verified by estimating the classification accuracy by leave-one-out cross-validation  on the nearest-neighbor classifier, based on pearson's correlation distance .

gene expression signature for hipscs descended from different parent scs
analyses of the differences in gene expression between the four hipsc lines and the parental sc lines revealed that  <dig>   genes in the am cells,  <dig>  genes in the mrc cells,  <dig>  genes in the pae cells, and  <dig>  genes in the ute cells showed significant differences between the hipsc lines and the corresponding parental lines, as determined using the student’s t-test  . in total,  <dig>  genes were categorized into a gene expression signature common to the above four gene sets with expression differences .

in this expression signature, 62% of the genes  were upregulated and 38%  were downregulated in the hipscs, as compared to the parental scs . from the  <dig> genes in the gene signature that were expressed at lower levels, gene ontology analyses revealed  <dig> terms with significant probability , whereas the  <dig>  genes that were expressed at higher levels were characterized by  <dig> terms ). in total,  <dig> terms were found, and the go analysis was determined to be inadequate for defining the biological functions of the expression signature in hipscs. the  <dig> terms were summarized into  <dig> terms as a macroscopic view; these terms shared  <dig> terms between the higher and lower expression levels .

network signature of hipscs by network screening
to elucidate the nature of the expression signature of the hipscs, we incorporated information on gene binding and function into a network analysis approach, named network screening  <cit>  . to prepare the network analysis, we identified  <dig> regulatory networks of  <dig> genes in the expression signature, which were classified with their functions using the gene sets defined previously  <cit>  , among  <dig> genes that were identified as being bound by the four factors in chip-on-chip experiments  <cit> . we then analyzed the  <dig> reference networks, which were regarded as being directly induced by the four factors , to define the network signature of the hipscs, according to the following two thresholds : 1) the enrichment probability of the genes in the expression signature for each network; and 2) the consistency of the network structure in relation to the gene expression profile  <cit> . thus, as the network signature, we defined  <dig> networks of  <dig> genes that fulfilled these conditions .

as expected, the network signature almost completely covered the pathways that were previously implicated in the reprogramming of hipsc pluripotency . for example, the relationship between reprogramming for pluripotency and signal transduction was emphasized for the tgf-β  <cit> , wnt  <cit> , and mapk pathways  <cit> . in addition, pathways related to cell-cell interactions were implicated. although the molecular mechanisms underlying the cell-cell interactions in the inner cellular states are less understood, several studies have highlighted the importance of cellular communication through the extracellular matrix with respect to changes in the cellular states, such as those that occur during development and differentiation  <cit> . furthermore, relationships to cancer-related pathways were identified, consistent with the fact that the four factors induce various cancer cells  <cit> ; this finding may be useful in the prevention of cancer induction by hipscs. although several pathways in the network signature remain to be characterized, it provides clues as to the molecular mechanisms underlying the reprogramming for hipsc pluripotency and self-renewal, in contrast to the information obtained from a characterization based simply on go terms.

networks with significant correlation between reprogramming and glycan biosynthesis
interestingly, two regulatory networks related to the glycome, for linkage of the inner and outer cellular states, appeared in the network signature . in general, glycan biosynthesis is a multi-step process that requires a variety of enzymes, i.e., glycosyltransferases and enzymes involved in cytosolic sugar metabolism, and in many cases, glycan biosynthesis follows a glycan-specific, linear pathway. most glycosyltransferases are regulated at the transcriptional level, thus warranting an assessment of the transcriptional profile of the glycan biosynthesis genes. in the two pathways, we found three genes  related to glycan transfer and two genes  related to heparan sulfate biosynthesis that were included in the expression signature . these findings are consistent with recent studies that revealed the association between n-glycans and the maintenance of embryonic stem cell  pluripotency  <cit>  and that between heparan sulfate and the reprogramming of escs  <cit> . therefore, the genes identified in the above two pathways are candidates for the maintenance of the outer cellular state of ipscs.

glycan signature unique to hipscs
in addition to the expression and network signatures of the inner cell state, we examined the differences in the outer cellular states of the hipscs and the parental scs using a lectin array, which detects glycan structures on cell surface proteins, based on glycan-lectin interactions  <cit> . in this analysis, the hipscs were clearly distinct from their parental scs, and the dendrogram of the lectin microarray generated by unsupervised hierarchical clustering showed a clear separation between the hipscs and the parental scs . although the binding relationships between lectins and glycans and the relationships between the changes in glycan structures and the corresponding glycosyltransferases are redundant  <cit> , we summarized the lectin-glycan-glycosyltransferase relationships using kegg glycan  <cit>  and by manual curation of previous reports. we found strong correlations between the gene expression profiles of the glycosyltransferases and the corresponding lectin fluorescence intensities . this result indicates that the glycosyltransferases are coordinately expressed with the reprogramming, with the result that the hipscs bear glycan structures that are distinct from those of their parental scs, reflecting the reprogramming of the inner cellular state.

based on the student’s t-test  analysis,  <dig> of the  <dig> lectins in the lectin microarray showed significant differences between the hipscs and the parental scs . for the glycan signature, we assigned  <dig> lectins, which interacted with the  <dig> glycosyltransferases that were related to the six patterns of glycan reactions, based on the correspondence with the expression signature .

candidates of possible linkages between the inner and outer cellular states
based on the correspondences between the expression and network signatures and between the expression and glycan signatures, we identified a total of  <dig> glycosyltransferases, since st6gal <dig> appeared in both sets of correspondences. these glycosyltransferases are potential candidates for the linkage between the inner and outer cellular states in hipscs. interestingly, these glycosyltransferases may be related to the biosynthesis of a glycolipid that is characteristic of hipscs . indeed, the allocation of the above glycosyltransferases to the pathways of “glycan biosynthesis and metabolism” in kegg glycan  revealed that the glycosyltransferases identified in the present study are important in the glycolipid biosynthetic pathway. we identified b3galt <dig> in the biosynthetic pathway for the carbohydrate chains of the globo-series of glycosphingolipids bearing the well-known ssea- <dig> and ssea- <dig> epitopes for escs and ipscs  <cit> , and although fut <dig> is not directly involved in the synthesis of these glycans, it was found in the neighboring pathway that leads to the type iv h antigen. furthermore, b3galt <dig> and gcnt <dig>  in addition to b3galt <dig> and fut <dig>  were found in the extensive biosynthetic pathway of the carbohydrate chains of the lacto- and neolacto-series glycosphingolipids that carry ssea- <dig>  which is intensively expressed in escs, but is absent in cells that have differentiated from escs  <cit> . in addition, the members of the galnt family, responsible for the o-glycan biosynthetic pathway of sialyl-t antigen, which is the most abundant glycan in several carcinoma cell lines, and st6gal <dig> were only found in the n-glycan biosynthetic pathway, which is involved in the generation of cell-surface carbohydrate determinants and the differentiation antigens hb- <dig>  cdw <dig>  and cd <dig>  <cit> . these analyses identified the glycosyltransferases that are directly and indirectly related to known glycan epitopes, thereby indicating the key molecules and the marker epitopes involved in reprogramming.

the fourteen glycosyltransferases with identified correspondences between expression, network, and glycan signatures were allocated to biosynthetic pathways, using the kegg glycan database with modifications. the names of the pathways are listed. see also additional file  <dig> for the detailed pathways of notable glycosyltransferases, according to the kegg glycan database.


further remarks on the present study
we analyzed more than  <dig> hipscs that were originally established from parental scs, and the correspondence between each hipsc and its parental sc was strictly controlled, which supports the present results based on a comparison with a clear genetic relationship. to further clarify the molecular mechanisms of the pluripotency, embryonic stem cells  should be analyzed, following the context of the present study. indeed, the pluripotency of hipscs has been extensively evaluated with reference to that of human escs, by various comparisons  <cit> . at present, we have prepared more than  <dig> hipscs with higher passages, and their comparisons with escs will be reported in the near future.

as for the experimental measurements, two types of data, gene expression and glycan structure, were analyzed by using microarrays and lectin arrays in the present study. to comprehensively understand the features of hipscs, more experimental data should be utilized, such as dna-methylation and mi-rna data. in particular, the recent availability of the next-gen sequencer will produce rna-seq and chip-seq data with more accurate measurements of gene expression and concrete information about the regulated genes. in addition, vast amounts of protein interaction data are accumulating. a comprehensive analysis integrating the various data from more hipscs will be reported in the near future.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study is the first to reveal the relationships between gene expression patterns and cell surface changes in hipscs, and it reinforces the importance of the cell surface to identify established ipscs from scs. in addition, given the variability of ipscs, which is related to the characteristics of the parental scs, a glycosyltransferase expression assay should be established that allows more precise definition of hipscs and facilitates their standardization, which are important steps towards eventual therapeutic applications of hipscs.
