BACKGROUND
template-based protein structure prediction methods  typically involve the following three steps. first, a  homologous protein with known structure is identified as a template for a query sequence. the second step is to obtain an optimal alignment between the query sequence and the template sequence. finally, a refined 3d model of the query protein can be generated based on the template structure. with more and more protein structural templates deposited in the current pdb database http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do, template-based methods are increasingly powerful and their applications to many aspects of life sciences are widely explored  <cit> .

the key step in template-based methods is to identify a structure template that shares a similar 3d structure with the query sequence. when the query protein shares significant sequence similarity with the template, classical sequence alignment methods, such as blast  <cit> , fasta  <cit> , smith-waterman  <cit>  or needleman-wunsch  <cit>  dynamic programming algorithm, are suitable and accurate in detecting their homologous relationship. generally, the template-based method for dealing with such "easy" templates is referred to as comparative modeling. however, proteins with weak sequence similarity are also frequently found to share similar 3d folds. such remote homology relationships can be hard to detect with classical sequence alignment methods. to find a template that shares only remote homology with the query protein, some profile-sequence  alignment methods like psi-blast  <cit> , rps-blast  <cit> , impala  <cit> , and hidden markov models   <cit>  have been used, and they often result in a marked improvement. nevertheless, the profile-sequence  alignment methods also perform poorly when the investigated protein pairs are situated in the twilight or midnight zone  <cit> . a lot of efforts have therefore been deployed to develop more sensitive and powerful remote homology detection techniques, called fold recognition. during the last decade, fold recognition has received considerable attention and a variety of elegant fold recognition methods  have been developed. the overall good performance of these techniques has been widely demonstrated in the casp  <cit>  and cafasp  <cit>  competitions as well as in real-time livebench experiments  <cit> .

the basic strategy of fold recognition methods consists in comparing the query sequence with all the structures within a fold library. according to the measured compatibility between sequence and structure, the fold recognition method can identify the template with the best fit. the well-established fold recognition methods can be roughly grouped into three main categories:  structure-seeded profile-based;  profile-profile alignment-based; and  machine learning methods-based. in the first category, 3d-pssm and fugue are probably the two best-known representative algorithms. for instance, 3d-pssm is based on a hybrid fold recognition approach using sequence profiles and structure-seeded profiles  coupled with predicted secondary structure information and solvation potential  <cit> . grouped into the second category, the profile-profile alignment methods have recently been proven to be very powerful in remote homology identification as well as in generating accurate sequence alignments  <cit> . generally, the profile-profile alignment method uses dynamic programming to obtain a direct alignment between two sequence profiles through psi-blast searching  <cit> . to improve the performance of the profile-profile alignment, the structural information  was also frequently added to measure the similarity of two positional vectors  <cit> . in the third category, machine learning-based methods were employed to combine different sequence and structural information into fold recognition systems  <cit> . in mgenthreader  <cit> , for instance, a neural network was used to combine pair-wise potentials, solvation potentials, and various alignment parameters. in the past several years, support vector machines  have also been widely used to build binary classifiers, which can allow the prediction of whether a sequence belongs to a single structural fold or not. provided there are sufficient data in different protein folds, a set of binary classifiers can be trained and integrated into a fold recognition system . a key step to establish an svm classifier is to find effective kernel functions, which measure the similarity between any pair of protein sequences. there are some established kernel functions such as spectral kernel  <cit> , profile-based string kernel  <cit> , and mismatch string kernel  <cit> .

a machine learning-based fold recognition method called descfold was developed in our previous work  <cit> . in descfold, any measurement between two proteins or any feature vector extracted from a protein sequence can be defined as a descriptor. for example, the amino acid composition of a protein can be regarded as a descriptor; the e-value obtained from a blast search of protein a against protein b can also be considered as a descriptor between a and b. based on such a broad definition, thirteen descriptors' fold identification capabilities were evaluated and four optimal descriptors were selected to construct the original version of descfold with the assistance of svms. although svms were frequently used to build discriminative models between various protein folds  <cit> , it should be emphasized that the svms here were employed to distinguish structurally similar and dissimilar protein pairs. the four implemented descriptors were a profile-sequence-alignment-based descriptor using psi-blast e-values and bit scores, a sequence-profile-alignment-based descriptor using rps-blast e-values and bit scores, a descriptor based on the alignment of secondary structural elements , and a descriptor based on the occurrence of prosite functional motifs  <cit> . although the original descfold was reported to significantly outperform a standard psi-blast search, it showed weaker performance than some well-established methods when tested on the livebench- <dig> targets  <cit> .

in the present study, we focus on developing an improved descfold method through the following efforts. first, a profile-profile-alignment-based  descriptor was incorporated into the new descfold method. of the existing profile-profile alignment algorithms, compass is one of the best-performing methods, and possess good computational efficiency  <cit> . additionally, compass is freely accessible to the community. in this work, the alignment scores resulting from the compass algorithm  <cit>  were defined as a ppa descriptor between a sequence pair. in the context of fold recognition, one of the aligned two sequences is regarded as a template, meaning that a structure-seeded profile is available for the template, which may contain different evolutionary information than a sequence profile derived from its homologous sequences. moreover, the structure-seeded profile for the template sequence was generated by searching its structural neighbors with the assistance of tm-align  <cit> . again, the compass algorithm was further used to derive a profile-structural-profile-alignment-based descriptor . finally, we also set up a user-friendly web server for descfold, and have made it freely accessible to the research community. here, we present details on the improvement resulting from two newly introduced profile-profile alignment related descriptors, the construction of the descfold web server, and the intensive benchmark results of testing descfold against some state-of-the-art fold recognition methods.

RESULTS
the performance of individual descriptors based on the scop_ <dig> _ <dig> dataset
based on the scop  <dig>  version  <cit> , we compiled a total of  <dig>  sequence-dissimilar but structurally related proteins into a highly diverse protein dataset named scop_ <dig> _ <dig>  then, we used the scop_ <dig> _ <dig> dataset to benchmark the six different descriptor types in leave-one-out fold identification experiments. each time, a protein in scop_ <dig> _ <dig> was selected as a "test" protein and the remaining proteins were regarded as a fold library. by calculating the pair-wise similarity scores defined in different descriptors, the "test" protein was scanned against the fold library and the protein with the most significant similarity score  was recorded. in case the top hit and the test protein belong to the same scop superfamily, a correct fold identification was assigned. when the above experiment is performed over all the scop_ <dig> _ <dig> proteins, a descriptor's performance can be simply quantified in terms of sensitivity by counting the number of proteins with correctly identified structural homologs. more details about the construction of the different types of descriptors and the compilation of the scop_ <dig> _ <dig> dataset are outlined in the methods section.

the sensitivities of fold identification using different descriptors are listed in table  <dig>  of the four descriptors used in the original descfold, the performance of the rps-blast- and psi-blast-based descriptors yield a sensitivity of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. predicted secondary structure has been proven to be useful in protein fold recognition/classification  <cit> , which can be effectively encoded by the ssea-based descriptor  <cit> . the ssea-based descriptor allows a correct identification rate of  <dig> %. the motif-based descriptor is only able to generate successful fold identification for approximately 20% of the total protein sequences. generally, the performance ranking of these four descriptors is in good agreement with the results from our previous study, although the descriptors were evaluated over two different datasets.

by capturing evolutionary information about residue preferences at different sequence positions in two profiles, profile-profile alignment has been shown to be very powerful in fold identification. compared with the aforementioned four descriptors, the two profile-profile alignment related descriptors achieve better performance, and both descriptors allow successful fold identification for more than 50% of the tested protein sequences. comparatively, the ppa descriptor is more powerful, and it outperforms the pspa descriptor by nearly two percentiles . regarding the pspa descriptor, the profile for one protein is derived from structural alignment results, which may contain different evolutionary information than the sequence profile inferred from the psi-blast search results. by further combining the ppa and pspa descriptors into our descfold system, it is hoped that the overall performance of descfold will be considerably improved.

the overall performance of descfold based on the scop_ <dig> _ <dig> dataset
the same strategy we used to evaluate the individual descriptors was used to assess the performance of descfold . for the purpose of comparison, computational experiments based on a combination of different descriptors were conducted. as shown in table  <dig>  the original descfold  can result in a sensitivity of about 56%. representing local sequence features of proteins, the motif-based descriptor is alignment independent, implying that it should be complementary to the other alignment related descriptors. this can be clearly demonstrated by a 4% lower sensitivity when the motif-based descriptor was removed from the original descfold system.

athe evaluation reflects fold identification performance of all proteins in the scop_ <dig> _ <dig> dataset. for each protein, only the generated top hit was taken into account.

as expected, the two profile-profile alignment related descriptors do provide considerable contributions to the new descfold method, with has a nearly 16% higher sensitivity than that of the original descfold. when the pspa descriptor was not included in the descfold system, a nearly 4% lower sensitivity was obtained, implying that the evolutionary information deposited in the two profile-profile alignment related descriptors are complementary to some extent. moreover, a receiver operating characteristic   <cit>  curve, which plots true positive instances as a function of false positive instances for all possible thresholds, was also employed to measure the performance of the new version of descfold. the improvement of descfold resulting from the introduction of the ppa and pspa descriptors is further revealed in the roc curve . at a less than 5% false positive rate  control, the new descfold method is able to correctly recognize folds for  <dig> % proteins, whereas only  <dig> % proteins are successfully identified by the original descfold method.

the above evaluation only reflects fold identification performance based on the generated top hits. as a more comprehensive evaluation, we also assessed descfold's remote homology identification for all the protein pairs within the scop_ <dig> _ <dig> dataset via roc analysis. as shown in figure  <dig>  the performance of descfold when combining different descriptors has the same characteristics as the corresponding roc curves in figure  <dig>  additionally, the performance can be further quantified by the auc and rocn scores. the auc score represents the corresponding area under the whole roc curve, while the rocn score is the area under the roc curve up to the first n false positives. since we pay more attention on the performance at low false positive rates, the rocn score is more useful for practical applications. in addition to the auc score, the roc <dig> , roc <dig> , and roc <dig>  scores  are also listed in table  <dig>  at a less than 5% false positive rate control, the corresponding roc <dig>  score resulting from the new descfold is approximately  <dig>  higher than that of the original one . considering the corresponding sensitivity at this false positive rate control, the new descfold is able to correctly identify approximately 69% of structurally similar protein pairs, providing an additional 15% improvement compared with the original descfold .

athese measurements reflect the performance of remote homology identification for all protein pairs within the scop_ <dig> _ <dig> dataset.

broc <dig> , roc <dig> , and roc <dig>  stand for the rocn scores at 1%, 5%, and 10% false positive rates, respectively.

cthe value inside the parentheses denotes the corresponding sensitivity.

the performance of descfold is further exemplified in the remote homology identification between two protein domains from the scop_ <dig> _ <dig> dataset . although d2a13a <dig>  shares weak sequence similarity with d1hmsa , they are structural homologs  and belong to the same scop superfamily . when we searched d2a13a <dig> against the remaining  <dig>  sequences using any individual descriptor, its superfamily partner  could not be ranked as the top hit. however, d1hmsa could be successfully assigned as the top hit when the search was carried out using our new descfold.

the descfold web server and a large-scale benchmarking experiment on the scop_ <dig> _ <dig> dataset
using the scop_ <dig> _40% dataset as the fold library, the descfold web server was set up and is freely accessible at http:// <dig> . <dig> /descfold/index.html. currently, a four-cpu dell linux machine with  <dig> gb of main memory hosts the descfold web server. generally, the computational time required for recognizing a protein's fold is reasonable for the current descfold server; it takes about ten minutes to process a query sequence of  <dig> amino acids. figure 4a is the submission page of the web server, and users can simply paste a protein sequence or upload a sequence file on this page to initiate the fold recognition process. when the recognition process is complete, users will be notified by e-mail. in the result page for fold recognition , the top hits' z-scores, scop entries, sequence files and pdb files are listed. to quantitatively understand the reliability of the identified templates, we point out the confidence levels for different hits. based on the current remote homology identification tests for all the protein pairs within the scop_ <dig> _ <dig> dataset , it was estimated that a z-score ≥  <dig>  yields a ≤ 1% error rate  and a z-score ≥  <dig>  indicates a ≤ 5% error rate . moreover, the scores for all descriptors and sequence alignments generated from psi-blast, rps-blast, ssea, ppa and pspa are also listed in the result page, which can allow users to further judge the identified templates are correct or not. among these sequence alignments, the ppa alignment based on the compass algorithm is recommended to be used to obtain a 3d model for the query sequence with the assistance of some comparative modelling packages.

by taking a similar strategy as reported in the literature of auto-scop  <cit> , we used a newer scop version  to provide a large-scale benchmark for the current descfold web server.  <dig>  proteins were selected from scop  <dig>  and compiled into a test dataset called scop_ <dig> _ <dig>  which covers  <dig> different folds and  <dig> different superfamilies. all the  <dig>  proteins share weak sequence similarities with the proteins in the fold library of descfold . on the other hand,  <dig>  and  <dig>  proteins in scop_ <dig> _ <dig> have at least one structural homolog in the fold library of descfold at the fold and superfamily levels, respectively. therefore, scop_ <dig> _ <dig> should be regarded as a good benchmarking dataset. more details about the selection of the scop_ <dig> _ <dig> dataset are outlined in the methods section. we processed these  <dig>  sequences via the current descfold server and recorded the top hit for each sequence. according to the scop classification scheme, we measured the performance at the fold and superfamily levels. at the fold level, a correct prediction for a test protein can be assigned in case the top hit and the test protein belong to the same scop fold type. generally, our descfold is able to do the correct fold identification for  <dig> %  test proteins, or some 21% more than a standard psi-blast search. at a less than 5% false positive rate control, our descfold method is able to correctly recognize folds for  <dig> % proteins, whereas only  <dig> % proteins are successfully identified by the standard psi-blast search . note that the parameter settings of the standard psi-blast search were the same as those used in deriving the psi-blast-based descriptor. when assessing the performance at the superfamily level, a correct prediction means the top hit and the test protein should from the same scop superfamily. descfold can correctly recognize structural homologs at the superfamily level for  <dig> %  test proteins, which outperforms psi-blast by a nearly 17% higher recognition rate. as further illustrated in the roc curve , descfold also reveals a much better performance than the standard psi-blast search.

comparison with some well-established fold recognition methods
in this work, our descfold method was first benchmarked against some state-of-the-art fold recognition methods based on the livebench targets. as a real-time fold recognition benchmark program, every week the livebench server submits newly released pdb proteins to the participating fold-recognition servers, and evaluates the corresponding results. here, we have selected the livebench- <dig>  targets  and livebench- <dig>  targets  as two reference test sets to compare the performance of descfold and some well-established fold recognition methods. although many fold recognition severs participated in the livebench- <dig>  and livebench- <dig>  experiments, we compared our descfold method with only five popular fold-recognition methods among them: 3d-pssm  <cit> , fugue  <cit> , mgenthreader  <cit> , inub  <cit>  and ffas  <cit> .

a livebench- <dig>  contains  <dig> targets, which can be divided into  <dig> trivial,  <dig> easy and  <dig> hard targets. as defined by the developer of livebench, trivial targets means those proteins sharing strong sequence similarity to the other previously known structures, as measured by blast using an e-value <  <dig> . the division of easy and hard targets is based on whether a structural template can be identified by psi-blast with an e-value <  <dig> .

ethe performance was evaluated based on the number of correctly assigned folds. we considered two hits as similar, provided that the z-score obtained by applying the ce structural alignment algorithm  <cit>  was > =  <dig> .

the performance of descfold on the livebench- <dig>  targets is also comparable to the five other fold recognition methods . considering performance within ≤  <dig> false positives, ffas is still the best performing method among the five other fold recognition methods, whereas 3d-pssm is ranked as the worst one again. the performance of descfold is between these two, which is close to the three other methods  . in our previous work, the same benchmark experiment was carried out based on the livebench- <dig> targets. taking fugue as a reference method, our original descfold was benchmarked to have a considerably lower fold identification rate  <cit> . however, the new descfold shows fully competitive performance with fugue in both livebench- <dig>  and livebench- <dig>  experiments, suggesting that a clear improvement to descfold has been made in this work.

ethe performance was evaluated based on the number of correctly assigned folds. we considered two hits as similar, provided that the z-score obtained by applying the ce structural alignment algorithm  <cit>  was > =  <dig> .

the lindahl dataset  <cit>  was also employed to further benchmark the performance of our descfold method. based on the scop database , the lindahl dataset contains  <dig> proteins, in which the sequence identity for any protein pair is < 40%. in this dataset,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> sequences have at least one matching structural homolog at the family, superfamily and fold levels, respectively. taking the same strategy and procedures as we used with the scop_ <dig> _ <dig> dataset to develop the descfold method, we retrained the descfold method based on the lindahl dataset. by employing the same assessment procedure as reported in the literature  <cit> , the top  <dig> and the top  <dig> matched templates for each query sequence were used to evaluate the sensitivity of recognition performance. since the lindahl dataset was based on an old version of scop, it may be quite subjective to benchmark different methods based on this dataset. ideally, the sequence and structural information of these  <dig> proteins should not be included in deriving the descfold prediction models. more stringently, the sequence and structural homologs of these  <dig> proteins should also not be used. in the present study, we used the scop database  to derive the pspa and motif-based descriptors. for instance, the pspa descriptor used the scop_ <dig> _40% dataset to construct the structure-seeded profile, which may inevitably contain structural homologs of these  <dig> proteins. meanwhile, the motif-based descriptor relied on the scop_ <dig> _95% dataset to derive the motif-fold compatibility, which may also utilize some sequence homologs of these  <dig> proteins. to allow for a fair comparison, we designed two descfold predictors. in the first predictor , both the pspa and motif-based descriptors were skipped. in the second predictor , the pspa descriptor was still not considered, while the motif-based descriptor was kept. to derive the motif-based descriptor, however, these  <dig> proteins' sequence homologs in the scop_ <dig> _95% database were filtered by a blast e-value threshold of  <dig> .

we compared the performance of our descfold with eight other fold recognition methods, including the standard psi-blast search, hhpred  <cit> , foldpro  <cit> , sparks  <cit> , sp <dig>  <cit> , sp <dig>  <cit> , sp <dig>  <cit>  and fugue  <cit> . the corresponding results for these eight methods were cited from refs.  <cit> and  <cit> . table  <dig> shows the sensitivities of descfold and the other well-established methods at the family, superfamily and fold levels, for the top  <dig> and top  <dig> matched templates, respectively. although the pspa was not considered, the performance of descfold  is fully comparable with the other methods. for prediction at the family level, the performance of descfold is very close to that of well-established methods. for prediction at the superfamily level, descfold is the best-performing method. regarding the top  <dig> prediction at the fold level, descfold surpasses all the tested methods except sp <dig>  it is also worth mentioning that our descfold  is still competitive even when both the pspa and motif-based descriptors are discarded.

although many efforts were taken to make sure that the above two benchmark experiments were intensive and strict, we are still not able to guarantee a fully unbiased assessment. regarding the benchmark based on the livebench targets, the fold libraries are different for the assessed methods, which may have some effect on the performance of the corresponding methods. for the comparative analysis based on the lindahl dataset, the performance of other methods was originally collected from different literature. in this case, the sequence databases used to generate the profiles are not the same, which may result in different performance to some extent. meanwhile, some methods may already have been significantly updated since their benchmark performance on the lindahl dataset was published. as pointed out by cheng and baldi  <cit> , such benchmark experiments can only provide a rough assessment rather than a very precise measurement. even so, both of the aforementioned two benchmark experiments conclude that the performance of descfold is fully comparable to some well-established peer methods.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we developed an improved descfold method by combining two new profile-profile alignment related descriptors . due to the fact that the profile-profile alignment is able to capture more evolutionary information which was missed in our original descfold, the new descfold leads to a much better performance. the new descfold method was benchmarked against some other state-of-the-art fold recognition techniques by using the livebench targets and lindahl dataset. our descfold method demonstrates competitive performance in comparison to the existing methods. to allow for practical applications, we have made it freely accessible to the community through a user-friendly web-server.

concerning future development, the following two efforts should be taken to maintain descfold as a competitive fold recognition system. firstly, the fold library of descfold should be regularly updated. to provide a more comprehensive fold library, those experimentally determined structures which are not included in the scop database should also be taken into account. secondly, seeking new descriptors is still the most important direction for development of a better predictor. on the one hand, machine learning based-methods allow the incorporation of more descriptors into a fold recognition system, which may yield better performance. on the other hand, the introduced descriptors will inevitably increase the complexity of the prediction model and obscure the contribution of each individual descriptor. therefore, a new descriptor candidate should be carefully assessed before its acceptance for inclusion in the future versions of descfold. thus, we expect such machine learning-based methods will not only result in a fold recognition system with higher accuracy, but also strengthen our fundamental understanding of the evolutionary relationship between protein sequence and structure.
