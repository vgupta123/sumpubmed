BACKGROUND
plants possess a large variety of defense mechanisms to prevent and fight pathogen attacks: their structural and chemical, preformed and inducible defense mechanisms limit the infection. when an avirulent pathogen meets a resistant plant, cells located around the infection site die within a few hours of contact. this phenomenon, called hypersensitive response, may cause damages to the pathogen and also leads to a mobile signal that will induce defense mechanisms in uninfected parts of the plant  <cit> . in a zone of some millimeters around the hypersensitive response site, cells develop the local acquired resistance  <cit> , characterized by the reinforcement of the cell wall, synthesis of antimicrobial phytoalexins, and expression of pathogenesis-related  genes  <cit> . at distant sites in the plant, systemic acquired resistance  is induced  <cit> . this resistance is associated with an accumulation of salicylic acid, prgenes expression and stimulation of many defense pathways  <cit> .

other kinds of micro-organisms can induce a resistance in plants against diseases: the non-pathogenic rhizobacteria, referred to as plant growth promoting rhizobacteria , can protect plants against pathogens. pgpr can affect pest population by antibiosis, nutrient competition or niche exclusion  <cit> . in addition to these direct antagonisms, rhizobacteria can induce a systemic resistance that makes the plant more resistant to a future pathogen attack. this long lasting, broad spectrum resistance, called induced systemic resistance   <cit> , is phenotypically similar to sar, but molecular events leading to its induction are different. isr is not associated with an increase of salicylic acid  <cit>  neither other hormones but needs the perception to jasmonate and ethylene  <cit> . transduction pathway of isr and sar are different but both need the regulatory protein npr <dig>  <cit> . downstream, the two pathways differ again because pr genes are not expressed in isr  <cit> .

despite extensive work, the protective mechanisms involved in isr are less well understood than those involved in sar. in many pathosystems, two defense pathways are generally associated with the enhanced protection level conferred by isr: the phenylpropanoid pathway and the oxylipin pathway. bacillus cereus b101r and b. subtilis af  <dig> induce lipoxygenase  activity in tomato  <cit>  and groundnut  <cit>  respectively. this enzyme is a dioxygenase that transforms poly-unsaturated fatty acids into hydroperoxides. it catalyses the first step of the oxylipin pathway. in tomato as in other angiosperms, lipoxygenase is encoded by a multigene family. tomloxa, tomloxb, and tomloxe are expressed principally in fruits during ripening  <cit> . tomloxc is expressed in fruits and leaves, and its products are converted into volatile aldehydes and alcohols  <cit>  responsible for the characteristic aroma of tomato plants  <cit> . tomloxd expression is stimulated by wounding, jasmonate, and systemin. this enzyme leads to the synthesis of defense compounds called octadecanoids  <cit> . hydroperoxides are consumed by different enzymes to generate oxylipins, among which one finds signal molecules such as jasmonic acid, aldehydes, and defense metabolites such as hexenal , colneleic acid, and colnelenic acid  <cit> .

in pseudomonas fluorescens wcs417r-inoculated carnation, phytoalexin synthesis is stimulated  <cit> . in pea treated with bacillus pumilus se <dig>  <cit> , macroscopic protection has been linked to reinforcement of the cell wall by deposition of callose, pectin, and other phenolic compounds. trichoderma asperellum t- <dig> protects cucumber against pseudomonas syringae pv. lachrymans by inducing phytoalexin synthesis through stimulation of the expression of genes coding for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase  and hydroperoxide lyase, an enzyme of the oxylipin pathway  <cit> . lignin and certain phytoalexins are produced via the phenylpropanoid pathway. the first step of this pathway is catalyzed by pal, which converts phenylalanine to cinnamic acid, the precursor of lignin, salicylic acid, some pigments such as anthocyanidins, condensed tannins, and phytoalexin phenylpropanoids  <cit> . enzyme stimulation as part of isr is generally effective after pathogen infection  <cit> .

previous studies have shown that p. putida btp <dig>  a pgpr strain isolated from a barley field  <cit> , can induce isr against pythium aphanidermatum  <cit>  in cucumber and against botrytis cinerea in bean  <cit>  and tomato  <cit> . in cucumber, the protection conferred by p. putida btp <dig> is associated with the accumulation, after pathogen inoculation, of fungitoxic phenolics that can be viewed as phytoalexins. isr in bean is characterized by enhanced levels of lox activity and poly-unsaturated fatty acids before pathogen challenge, and by stimulation of hydroperoxide lyase activity and volatile oxylipins production after pathogen challenge. pal activity, however, is not stimulated. lox activity has been shown to be stimulated in p. putida btp1-treated tomato plants after infection, but as these experiments were done on detached leaves and as lox activity is stimulated by wounding  <cit> , the results might be different for whole plants.

in this work, isr induced by p. putida btp <dig> was studied in whole tomato plants. we showed that the pal activity is not induced by the isr, contrary to the lox activity. as lox is encoded by a multigene family, we measured the expression levels of five genes to identify which isoforms might contribute to this increase. we showed that only two genes participated to this stimulation: tomloxd and a newly identified gene, tomloxf. we cloned and expressed tomloxf in bacteria to characterize its protein, and showed that the recombinant tomloxf preferentially consumed linolenic acid and introduced oxygen onto the 13th carbon of the fatty acid. finally, we confirmed our results by analyzing the accumulation of the products of tomloxf in the plant, and showed that the 13-hydroperoxy-octadecatrienoic acid and its reduced form were more abundant in bacterized plants.

RESULTS
phenylalanine ammonia-lyase is not stimulated in p. putida btp1-mediated isr
pal activity was quantified before and after pathogen inoculation in control and bacterized plants, in order to assess whether this pathway contributes to the enhanced protection level associated with isr. no significant difference was detected between control and p. putida btp1-treated plants, either before pathogen challenge or two or four days after infection  .

p. putida btp <dig> induces lipoxygenase activity
the linolenic-acid- and linoleic-acid-consuming lox activities of treated and untreated plants were monitored to determine if they are stimulated by p. putida btp <dig>  before infection, as shown in figure  <dig>  consumption of linolenic acid by lox was higher in bacterized plants than in control plants. the activity increased in response to infection and two days after pathogen inoculation, it remained higher in the treated plants. after four days of infection, the activity difference was no longer significant  . in contrast, p. putida btp1-treated and control plants showed no significant difference in linoleic acid consumption either before or after inoculation of b. cinerea . the linoleic-acid-consuming lox activity thus did not seem to be influenced by infection or by isr.

expression of tomlox genes in response to p. putida btp <dig> treatment
to determine which lox isozyme might be involved in the lox activity increase during isr, we analyzed tomlox gene expression. during our attempts to clone a tomloxc cdna probe, a 500-bp rt-pcr product was amplified from total rna extracted from methyljasmonate-treated tomato leaves. sequencing of this product revealed that the corresponding cdna shares 82% similarity with tomloxc. gene-specific primers for 3' and 5' rapid amplification of cdna ends  were synthesized on the basis of this sequence. the 5'race and 3'race products were amplified from the rna of tomato leaves treated with methyljasmonate and from the rna of tomato leaves treated with p. putida btp <dig>  the sequences of all the overlapping race products were strictly identical , and a full-length 2837-bp cdna, called tomloxf, was identified  . this cdna sequence was found to harbor a complete  <dig> -bp open reading frame flanked by a 40-bp 5'-utr and a 88-bp 3'-utr. the first atg encountered from the 5'-end of the cdna was considered to be the start codon of the open reading frame . the deduced protein sequence consists of  <dig> amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. blastp analysis of the deduced tomloxf amino acid sequence showed that this protein shares  <dig> to 79% identity with other known plant lox proteins and that it possesses the two domains that are typically conserved in plant lipoxygenase proteins, the plat_lh <dig> domain  and the lox domain pfam <dig>  . the plant lipoxygenases most closely related to tomloxf are solanum tuberosum stloxh <dig>  <cit> , nicotiana attenuata nalox <dig>  <cit> , and lycopersicon esculentum tomloxc  <cit> , sharing respectively 79%, 78%, and 76% identity with tomloxf at the amino acid level. in contrast, the predicted amino acid sequence of tomloxf displays only 40-49% identity to other identified tomato lipoxygenases. tomloxf contains known lox motifs harboring all the amino acid residues conserved among plant lox proteins  and involved in iron binding and enzyme catalytic activity  <cit> . furthermore, tomloxf possesses the conserved ser/phe motif  occurring at the bottom of the substrate-binding pocket of nearly all plant lox enzymes that introduce dioxygen onto the 13th carbon of the fatty acid  and determining their regio-specificity  <cit> . a phylogenetic analysis was performed in order to determine the proximity of tomloxf to other plant lox proteins. multiple sequence alignments were done and an unrooted phylogenetic tree was constructed . according to the classification of feussner and wasternack  <cit> , the tree could be divided into two major groups. the first group includes the type  <dig> lipoxygenases, which are enzymes harboring no transit peptide and sharing high within-group sequence similarity. the second group includes the type  <dig> lipoxygenases, which carry a putative chloroplast transit peptide sequence and share only moderate overall within-group sequence similarity. to date, the type- <dig> lox proteins all belong to the 13-lox subfamily  <cit> . this group can be further divided into two subgroups. the first includes, among others, atlox <dig>  <cit> , bolox  <cit> , nalox <dig>  <cit> , tomloxd  <cit> , and stloxh <dig>  <cit> , enzymes shown to be involved in the wound-induced biosynthesis of jasmonic acid. the second group includes stloxh <dig>  <cit>  and tomloxc  <cit> , two lox isoforms playing a key role in the generation of fatty-acid-derived short-chain volatiles  <cit> . the topology of the phylogenetic tree clearly shows that tomloxf belongs to the type- <dig> lox group and that it is closely related to enzymes producing hydroperoxides consumed preferentially by hydroperoxide lyase, a c6-volatile-producing enzyme. prediction of the subcellular localization of the tomloxf protein was done by means of four different programs. the ipsort program predicted a mitochondrial localization, whereas the presence of a transit peptide for chloroplast targeting was predicted by the targetp <dig> , wolfpsort, and chlorop <dig>  programs. chlorop <dig>  identified a 54-residue chloroplast transit peptide at the n- terminus of the tomloxf protein. this n-extension of the sequence shows some features typical of a chloroplast sorting signal  <cit> , including a high content in hydrophilic amino acid residues  and a very low content in acidic residues . in this group, atlox <dig>  tomloxc, tomloxd, stloxh <dig>  stloxh <dig>  and pvlox <dig> have been demonstrated to be actively imported into or localized within the chloroplast  <cit> . on the basis of these observations, it is likely that tomloxf also encodes a chloroplast-targeted lox.

as lox activity was induced by the bacterial treatment, the expression of each gene in response to p. putida btp <dig> treatment was analyzed at transcript level in order to determine the relative contribution of the various isoforms to activity increase. before infection, tomloxa, tomloxb, and tomloxc transcripts were barely detected in leaves of control and treated tomato plants . these genes were found not to be upregulated upon pathogen attack and the transcript level was similar for control and treated plants. the tomloxd and tomloxf genes displayed a different expression profile: basal-level expression before infection but clearly increased expression upon pathogen challenge, the increase being more pronounced in plants bacterized beforehand with p. putida btp <dig> than in control plants. this differential stimulation of the transcription level in control and treated plants was transient in the case of tomloxd, since similar amounts of transcripts were found to have accumulated in leaves from both kinds of plants  <dig> hours after infection by b. cinerea. stimulation of the tomloxf gene in bacterized plants appeared more consistent, since the transcript level remained slightly higher than in control leaves four days post infection.

tomloxf uses linolenic acid as substrate and exhibits 13-lox activity
to check whether increased tomloxf transcription could be partly responsible for increased linolenic acid-consuming activity, we cloned and expressed the tomloxf cdna in e. coli, without its choroplastic peptide signal, but with a poly-his tag. total proteins were extracted by sonication and analyzed by sds-page and western blotting with an anti-his-tag antibody . this showed the presence of a ±  <dig> kda protein in extracts from clones containing the tomloxf. lox activity was assayed in the total protein extracts using linolenic acid as substrate. we only detected lox activity in the extract from the clone containing the tomloxf sequence and induced by iptg . recombinant tomloxf was purified by affinity chromatography and detected through sds-page and western blotting with an anti-his-tag antibody . the purity of the purified protein was checked by sds-page and coomassie blue staining. it showed the presence of some contaminating proteins. the activity of the semi-purified tomloxf was evaluated using either linoleic acid or linolenic acid as substrate. partially-purified tomloxf showed a higher activity on linolenic acid than on linoleic acid  .

depending on their regiospecificity, lox enzymes can introduce the oxygen at the 9th or 13th position of linoleic and linolenic acids. to determine the regiospecificity of partially purified tomloxf, we first monitored its ph activity profile using linolenic acid as substrate  to optimize the ph of the reaction buffer. partially purified tomloxf had an activity optimum of ph  <dig> . tomloxf was then incubated at this ph with its two substrates, in combination or separatly, and the reaction products were analyzed by hplc. in all cases only 13-derivatives  of fatty acids were detected suggesting that tomloxf is a 13-lox .

on the basis of these similarities, it was hypothesized that tomloxd is a linolenate-consuming lipoxygenase  <cit> . to confirm this activity, we also cloned and expressed the tomloxd cdna to obtain recombinant his-tagged tomloxd protein. as the chloroplastic signal peptide can provoke some problems during the production in bacteria, we determined it with the "chlorop" bioinformatics program and it was not included in the sequence cloned in pet-28a plasmid. unfortunately, no enzymatic activity was detected whatever the position of the his's-tag . we hypothesized that the chloroplastic signal peptide determined by the program was maybe too long: it indeed contained a part  of a beta barrel probably involved in substrate binding. we aligned the sequences of tomloxf and tomloxd and determined manually the signal peptide of tomloxd. we cloned once again the cdna without the sequence of the signal and expressed it in e. coli bl <dig>  we also cloned the full cdna including the signal peptide. after induction of expression, we were not able to detect any lox activity for any of the constructs. we also tried to express the different constructs in other strains of e. coli: e. coli c43de <dig> , in e. coli hms174de <dig>  and in e. coli krx , but no result was obtained .

treatment with p. putida btp <dig> induces a more rapid accumulation of oxylipins
we also analyzed the level of two free oxylipins: the 13-hydropreoxyoctadecatrienoic acid , which is produced by lox from linolenic acid, and its reduced derivative, the 13-hydroxyoctadecatrienoic acid . we quantified these molecules before and two days after pathogen inoculation, where transcriptional and enzymatic differences were shown to be maximal between control and bacterized plants. as expected, we observed differences between control and treated plants: before infection, the level of free 13-hot was only slightly higher in p. putida btp1-treated plants than in control plants, but two days after pathogen inoculation it was about two fold higher in treated-plants than in control plants . 13-hpot also seemed more abundant in bacterized plants after pathogen challenge.

discussion
results from this study show that pre-inoculation of the rhizobacterium p. putida btp <dig> on tomato roots protects the host plant against gray mold caused by the fungal pathogen b. cinerea on leaves. previous studies carried out in cucumber  <cit> , in bean  <cit>  and in tomato  <cit>  showed that p. putida btp <dig> is not able to induce sar. moreover, the bacteria do not migrate to the leaves, demonstrating that the reduction of the symptoms is not caused by a direct antagonism between p. putida btp <dig> and b. cinerea  <cit> . these observations suggest that disease reduction by p. putida btp <dig> in indeed a case of isr.

this resistance is not associated with stimulation of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase. involvement of this enzyme in isr can vary according to the plant species and pre-inoculated rhizobacterial strain. as in the case of p. putida btp <dig>  the resistance induced by b. cereus b101r in tomato is not characterized by stimulation of pal  <cit> , but in pseudomonas fluorescens pf1-treated tomatoes, resistance is associated with enhanced pal activity after inoculation of the pathogen p. aphanidermatum  <cit> . t. asperellum t- <dig> protects cucumber against p. syringae pv. lachrymans by inducing phytoalexin synthesis through stimulation of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase expression  <cit> . in bean, p. putida btp <dig> does not induce pal activity  <cit> , but in cucumber, the resistance conferred by this rhizobacterium is associated with the accumulation of fungitoxic phenolics that can be viewed as phytoalexins and that may be produced via the phenylpropanoid pathway  <cit> .

unlike pal activity, lox activity consuming linolenic acid is stimulated by treatment with p. putida btp <dig>  before infection, lox activity is higher in treated plants than in controls. it increases in response to pathogen attack, remaining higher in treated plants two days after pathogen inoculation.

we have further investigated which lox isoforms are involved in this stimulation, and we have identified and characterized a full-length cdna encoding a new lox from tomato leaves: tomloxf is the sixth lipoxygenase isoform identified in tomato. bioinformatic analysis shows that the product of this gene belongs to the type  <dig> subset of lox proteins. all the lox proteins identified to date in this group are 13-lox proteins, and a chloroplastic localization has been demonstrated for atlox <dig> from arabidopsis thaliana, tomloxc and tomloxd from tomato, stloxh <dig> and stloxh <dig> from potato, and pvlox <dig> from bean  <cit> . this class of lox is known to be involved in biotic and abiotic stresses. as initial reaction, 13-lox catalyses the insertion of molecular oxygen at position  <dig> of linoleic or linolenic acid.

the fatty acid hydroperoxides produced might thus be converted to jasmonic acid via the octadecanoid pathway or be metabolized via the lipoxygenase pathway by a variety of enzymes, including hydroperoxide lyase, allene oxide synthase, divinyl ether synthase, to form diverse plant-associated oxylipins such as volatile aldehydes, alcohols, divinyl ethers,...  <cit> . although different branches of the pathway utilize hydroperoxides as a common substrate, recent studies tend to demonstrate that specific substrates for the enzymes of these branches are supplied by distinct lox isoforms  <cit> .

in arabidopsis thaliana, atlox <dig> has been directly linked to the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid  <cit> . similarly, silencing of nalox <dig> in nicotiana attenuata specifically suppresses ja accumulation upon injury, but does not affect the production of leaf volatiles  <cit> . in potato, antisense inhibition of stloxh <dig> expression has no effect on the release of volatiles  <cit>  or on wound-induced ja accumulation, but it drastically reduces the post injury accumulation of protease inhibitors, thereby enhancing the susceptibility of the plants to insect attack  <cit> . the product of tomloxd is expressed mainly in response to wounding or methyl jasmonate treatment. it may also play a role as a component of the octadecanoid defense-signaling pathway, leading to the production of jasmonic acid  <cit> , but not to the generation of volatiles  <cit> .

on the other hand, specific depletion of tomloxc in tomato has no effect on jasmonic acid biosynthesis, whereas it results in a marked reduction in the production of fatty-acid-derived c <dig> short-chain aldehydes and alcohols  <cit> . it thus seems that the prime role of tomloxc and stloxh <dig> is to supply hydroperoxide lyase with substrates for the production of c <dig> volatiles, but not to supply hydroperoxides to the octadecanoid pathway.

as mentioned by feussner and wasternack  <cit> , phylogenetic tree analysis of the lox multigene family might be helpful in predicting at least some biochemical features and may provide suggestions regarding physiological functions. from this analysis, it clearly appears that tomloxd, atlox <dig>  nalox <dig>  and stloxh <dig>  all similarly involved in ja biosynthesis, are closely related. on the basis of these similarities, it was suggested that tomloxd possesses a linolenate-consuming lipoxygenase activity  <cit> . however this was never definitely proved. so we tried to produce recombinant his-tagged tomloxd in e. coli. unfortunately, despite numerous attempts, we were not able to produce an active tomloxd protein to confirm this hypothesis. tomloxd may be an inactive protein in plant tissues, but this hypothesis could be excluded as a protein close to tomloxd  showed activity  <cit> . the e. coli expression system used here is probably not appropriate for the expression of tomloxd.

tomloxc and stloxh <dig>  key lipoxygenases specifically involved in the generation of volatiles, are grouped on another branch of the tree. phylogenetic analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of tomloxf strongly suggests that it belongs to the type- <dig> family of lox proteins, within the subgroup including tomloxc and stloxh <dig>  recombinant his-tagged tomloxf shows 13-lox activity and uses preferentially linolenate as substrate. collectively, our data suggest that tomloxf encodes a 13-lox probably involved in the production of c <dig> volatile compounds. this hypothesis is consolidated by the fact that the hydroperoxide lyase of tomato consumes preferentially 13-hpot  <cit> .

our transcriptional study of genes coding for five isoforms  has revealed that only tomloxd and tomloxf contribute to the enhanced lox activity observed in p. putida btp1-treated tomatoes.

the time course of tomloxd and tomloxf induction in treated plants compared to controls is very interesting. levels of transcripts of these genes are higher in bacterized plants during the first days of infection, which are crucial for b. cinerea infection of tomato leaves. this early activation of lox might allow the plant to develop a resistance mechanism during the first stages of disease development. on the other hand, tomloxa, tomloxb, and tomloxc are induced neither by pathogen attack nor by treatment with p. putida btp <dig>  tomloxa is expressed principally in fruits during maturation and in seeds during germination  <cit> . tomloxb is expressed only in fruits during the latest phase of ripening and during senescence  <cit> . the absence of stimulation of tomloxc transcription is surprising, as the isozyme encoded by this gene produces hydroperoxides that are consumed principally by the hydroperoxide lyase branch of the oxylipin pathway, and converted into volatiles  <cit> . some of these volatiles are fungitoxic  <cit>  or can induce expression of certain genes of the oxylipin pathway, namely lox and allene oxide synthase  <cit> . tomloxc is stimulated during the early stage of fruit ripening  <cit> , but not by wounding  <cit> .

the stimulation of the linolenate-consuming activity during isr and tomloxf transcription level are concomitant, suggesting that this isoform contributes to the increased linolenic acid-consuming lox activity. this gene codes for a protein that consumes linolenic acid preferentially. we showed that it consumes also linoleic acid. but it seems that the increase in linoleic acid-consuming activity caused by the increase of tomloxf transcription is too low to be detectable.

to confirm our results, we also analyzed the accumulation of free 13-hpot and 13-hot in plants. 13-hot, which is produced from 13-hpot by the hydroperoxyde reductase, by the peroxygenase, or by auto oxidation  <cit> , is more abundant after infection in bacterized plants. 13-hpot seemed also to be more abundant in p. putida btp1-treated plant than in controls after infection . these results suggest that, after infection, bacterized plants over-produce 13-hpot by the linolenate-consuming lox activity, leading to the formation of antifungal 13-hot. the increase in oxylipin content could also be due to auto oxidation of fatty acid following the pathogen attack, but it can not explain the difference between control and treated plants. indeed, if the increase was totally caused by auto oxidation after infection, the level of oxylipins should be higher in control plants as the latter show higher infection rates. only a precedent study showed an oxylipin accumulation in isr: in bean, p. putida btp <dig> stimulates the accumulation of 13-hpot before infection with b. cinerea, but the difference was not significative anymore after pathogen challenge  <cit> .

in bean, lox activity is enhanced before infection and it remains higher in plants treated with p. putida btp <dig> than in control plants for up to three days after b. cinerea inoculation  <cit> . in cucumber, lox activity is not stimulated by the rhizobacterium, but the activity of enzymes situated downstream the lox in the pathway is higher in treated plants during the first days of infection  <cit> . hence, stimulation of the oxylipin pathway in the host plant may be a general phenomenon associated with root colonization by p. putida btp <dig>  but if it may be a general phenomenon, it is probably not the only defense mechanism induced in plant by the pgpr. other defense mechanisms need to be analyzed to determine their implication in p. putida btp1-mediated isr.

it is interesting to compare our results realized onto whole plants with works realized by adam et al  <cit>  on the same plant species with the same pgpr and same pathogen, but on cut leaves. with cut leaves, the increase of lox activity is more rapid in treated plants and, in control and treated tomatoes, reaches its maximal value two days after the beginning of the infection, resulting in higher differences than in our work. in our study, we wanted to see only the effect of p. putida btp <dig> on whole plant, because the wounding caused by cutting the leaves could interfere with the isr effect, especially on the lox, which is induced by wounding  <cit> . so, it seems important to study defense mechanisms induced by isr working with non stressed plant material.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, isr induced by the pgpr p. putida btp <dig> in tomato is associated with a higher level of tomloxd and tomloxf transcription, the enzyme encoded by the latter gene being a newly identified lox isoform in this plant. the products of these genes are most probably partly responsible for the increase in overall lox activity in resistant leaves. lox might possibly not be the only enzyme of the oxylipin pathway to be stimulated by isr in tomato. in bean, hydroperoxide lyase is stimulated in response to infection in treated plants  <cit> . a previous study on detached tomato leaves has revealed that enzymes situated downstream in the lox pathway are stimulated by p. putida btp <dig>  <cit> . metabolite production and the activities of different enzymes of the oxylipin pathway should be further studied in order to increase our knowledge of the importance of the lox pathway in isr.
