BACKGROUND
nematodes are the most abundant metazoans on earth and show remarkable diversity in their ecological and feeding habits  <cit> . although notorious as parasites and pathogens of humans, animals, and plants, the majority of nematodes are beneficial to us as they recycle nutrients in soils and oceans  <cit> . another beneficial nematode group known as entomopathogenic nematodes  encompass two genera, steinernema, and heterorhabditis. these epns symbiotically associate with gram-negative gammaproteobacteria, xenorhabdus, and photorhabdus, respectively  <cit> . because of their ability to kill insects rapidly and amenability to mass production, they are widely used for the biological control of the insect pests of crops . the epns are models to study animal-microbe symbiosis , nematode parasitism  <cit>  and ecology  <cit> .

the infective juvenile  stage of the heterorhabditis spp. is a developmentally arrested stage analogous to the dauer stage of the c. elegans  <cit> , and infective l <dig> stage of many animal parasitic nematodes  <cit> . ijs are the only epn stage found in nature outside the insect-host, and are capable of surviving tough environmental conditions in the soil for long periods of time. the nematodes in the ij stage do not feed or grow until they find a new insect-host, and they possess a remarkable ability to actively search, follow and infect their insect-host in the soil environment  <cit> . ijs are known to show different kinds of parasitic behaviors  <cit> . they can be desiccated to quiescence or frozen in liquid nitrogen  <cit> , and then be revived back to life. thus, there is a possibility to extend the lifespan/delay life cycle. because of this remarkable environmental toughness of the ijs, all the epn formulations, presently available in the market, are based on this stage. an extensive body of research exists on the genes, pathways, and processes involved in aging in the free-living nematode, c. elegans . a similar understanding of genes that increase the lifespan in epns would be directly beneficial in extending the shelf-life of epn ijs, and ij based formulations to improve their use as a pest control product .

genomic tools and technologies have allowed the researchers to uncover the amazing biology of nematodes . the genome of the epn, heterorhabditis bacteriophora tto1-m31e strain has been sequenced  <cit>  and is available in the public domain. additionally, the expressed sequence tags  of h. bacteriophora gps- <dig> strain  <cit>  and transcriptome of the adult stage of h. bacteriophora tto1-m31e were published earlier  <cit> . large amount of information is available on molecular biology of the dauer/developmentally arrested l <dig> and l <dig> stages of various nematodes, such as free-living c. elegans and c. briggsae , insect-associated pristionchus  <cit> , animal parasitic strongyloides stercoralis  <cit>  and ostertagia ostertagi  <cit>  and many plant parasitic nematodes . however, such information is completely lacking for ij stage of epns. scanty information available on the heterorhabditis ij ‘recovery’ is not adequate to decipher the various molecular and physiological pathways specific to these ijs  <cit> . additionally, it is suggested that genes expressed in survival or dispersal stages in nematodes, such as dauer, and epn ijs, are more likely to be novel, compared with the genes expressed in adult or larval stages  <cit> .

h. indica was the first species of this genus recorded from india  <cit> . since then, various surveys showed that h. indica is the most predominant species of heterorhabditid nematode in india and is found in almost all the geographical parts of the country. therefore, h. indica is naturally suitable for incorporation in insect biological control programs in india. in the present study, the transcriptomic analysis of the ij stage of h. indica was carried out to understand the molecular processes and pathways active at this stage, and to create a resource for further functional genomics and genetic investigations.

RESULTS
transcriptome sequencing and assembly
the mrna sequencing of ij stage of h. indica using the illumina gaiix platform yielded about  <dig>  million reads of  <dig> base read-lengths generating 64x coverage. after quality filtering,  <dig>  million high-quality reads totalling  <dig>  gigabases of data were obtained. the de-novo sequence assembly was carried out by velvet at different k-mer lengths  with minimum contig length of  <dig>  the optimal assembly was attained at k-mer  <dig> which resulted in  <dig>  contigs with 909 bp n <dig> . merging of transcripts from  <dig> to 83 k-mer range by oases resulted in  <dig>  transcripts with  <dig>  bp n <dig> size. removing duplicates by cd-hit-est, and filtering out < 300 bp transcripts resulted in  <dig>  unique transcripts with n <dig> of  <dig>  bp . total of  <dig>  proteins were predicted by orfpredictor  <cit>  which were then used for downstream analysis.table  <dig> assembly statistics of h. indica transcriptome generated by velvet and oases



characterization of h. indica transcripts
the blastx analysis of h. indica transcripts resulted in annotation of  <dig>  transcripts , of which  <dig>  hits matched to animal and plant parasitic, as well as free-living nematodes i.e. a. suum , ancylostoma ceylanicum , haemonchus contortus , loa loa , brugia malayi , wucheria bancroftii , c. elegans , c. brenneri , heterodera glycines , c. remanei , c. briggsae , h. avenae , m. incognita , bursaphelenchus xylophilus  . due to absence of h. bacteriophora hits in the blastx results, we performed a standalone blastx of h. indica transcripts against h. bacteriophora protein dataset  downloaded from the wormbase . the blastx resulted in  <dig>  protein hits .fig.  <dig>

metabolic pathway analysis was done using kegg automatic annotation server against c. elegans, c. briggsae, b. malayi, loa loa and trichinella spiralis pathways. the analysis of kegg pathways represented by the abundant transcripts revealed that, among others, at fpkm ≥  <dig> , the various signaling pathways like pi3k-akt, hippo, hif-signaling pathway, rap, mapk, calcium, sphingolipid, cgmp-pkg, insulin signaling pathway were represented by at least one or more protein . however, at fpkm ≥  <dig>  in addition to the above pathways, several other signaling pathways like foxo, camp, ras, sphingolipid, epithelial cell, ampk, tgf-ß were detected .

the kinome of h. indica ijs
the kinome analysis was done to identify the protein kinases important in signal transduction in all the above mentioned signaling pathways that regulate metabolism, cell cycle, growth and development, and responses to environmental stimuli. as against  <dig> kinases reported from c. elegans  <cit> , we detected  <dig> in h. indica ij transcriptome at stringent blastp parameters of at least 40 % sequence identity and 50 % query coverage . these  <dig>  kinases were classified into  <dig> groups, and we found that 137 kinase groups were common between c. elegans and h. indica, whereas, 50 kinase groups were not found in h. indica. the details of kinase groups common between c. elegans, and h. indica are given in table  <dig>  and kinases that could not be discovered in h. indica but present in c. elegans are listed in additional file 5: table s <dig> table  <dig> kinases belonging to different group/family/subfamily represented in ij stage of h. indica

a total of  <dig>  secreted proteins were predicted . the important proteins found in the analysis were related to neuropeptide signaling, for example,  <dig> each of gpcr-family  <dig> like and gpcr rhodopsin-like including gpcr rhodopsin-like 7tm, and gpcr family  <dig> c-terminal domains. several hydrolases were identified, including  <dig> hydrolases belonging to small gtpases, glycoside hydrolases, transthyretin/hydroxyisourate hydrolase, alpha/beta hydrolase and epoxide hydrolase. the secretome showed the presence of a large contingent of peptidases that have a known role in degrading insect tissues. we could identify  <dig> peptidases belonging to different classes, such as metallopeptidases, trypsin-like cysteine/serine peptidases, cysteine peptidases, peptidase s <dig> , s1a, s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  some of these peptidases like carboxypeptidase possess regulatory domains. a search of the merops database  <cit>  for identification of putative peptidases  identified  <dig> known peptidases of the different parasitic and free-living nematodes . five transcription factors including stat, p <dig>  tfiid were also identified. several genes involved in signaling, such as  <dig> members of protein kinases were present in the secreted contingent, including serine threonine, tyrosine, and thiamine phosphate kinase. similarly,  <dig> members of phosphatases were found. lastly, the transcripts showed the presence of several known stress response genes such as glutathione peroxidases, heat shock protein  <dig> and heat shock protein  <dig> 

repeat elements in h. indica transcriptome
the transcriptome data was used to analyze the repeat elements because no information is available for repeat elements in this species. transcript sequences were examined for the presence of repeat elements using repeat masker v- <dig> . <dig> program. approximately  <dig>  % of the total transcripts were found to be encoded by different repetitive elements, of which  <dig>  % belonged to simple repeats, and  <dig>  % were low complexity repeats . a total of  <dig> retroelements were found in the transcripts, with four long interspersed repeat elements , although no short interspersed repeat elements  were found. among retroelements,  <dig> long terminal repeats  were found which was higher than non-ltr elements. also,  <dig> dna transposons of different classes,  <dig> small rna, and three satellites were found .

discussion
the transcriptome sequencing and assembly of h. indica ijs resulted in  <dig>  unique, high-quality transcripts at n <dig> value of  <dig>  bp. further,  <dig>  out of  <dig>   transcripts could be annotated by blastx against nr database. most of the blastx hits showed similarity with a. suum and not h. bacteriophora which is a closely related species. this anomaly may be attributed to the absence of h. bacteriophora sequences from nr database. standalone blast identified  <dig>  hits with h. bacteriophora.

the free living-developmentally arrested infective stage is characteristic of many parasitic nematodes . the “dauer hypothesis” proposes that similar molecular mechanisms regulate the developmental arrest and activation of both c. elegans dauer larvae and analogous developmentally arrested 3rd stage larvae  of parasitic nematodes  <cit>  despite their evolutionary divergence  <cit> . in the free-living model nematode, c. elegans, a developmentally arrested dauer stage is formed during conditions of low food abundance, high temperature  <cit> , high dauer pheromone levels  <cit>  and high population density  <cit> . the daf  genes identified in c. elegans that are involved in formation and regulation of dauer stages are placed into four dauer pathways-a cyclic guanosine monophosphate  signaling pathway, an insulin/igf-1-like signaling  pathway regulated by insulin-like peptide  ligands, a dauer transforming growth factor-β  pathway regulated by the ce-daf- <dig> ligand, and a nuclear hormone receptor  regulated by a class of steroid ligands known as dafachronic acids   <cit> . epistatic analysis revealed that the cgmp signaling pathway operates upstream of the parallel iis and dauer tgf-β pathways, which converge on the da biosynthetic pathway, ultimately regulating the nhr ce-daf- <dig>  <cit> . analysis of dauer pathways in the l3i stage of s. stercoralis revealed that out of four pathways involved in dauer formation, two were conserved while two were not, suggesting their conserved and novel modes of developmental regulation  <cit> . our results show that at least two of the canonical dauer pathways-insulin signaling pathway and cgmp-pkg signaling pathway were represented in the top  <dig> active pathways by at least  <dig> and  <dig> proteins, respectively . further, tgf-β pathway was represented by  <dig> proteins, and the dafachronic acid pathway was represented by a single but important gene, daf- <dig> . daf- <dig> encodes a tgf-beta type i receptor homolog, which, in association with the daf- <dig>  regulates dauer formation in response to environmental signals through the asi chemosensory neuron . our results show that similar to c. elegans, all the four dauer formation pathways are conserved and active in the ij stage of h. indica.

epn ijs are not known to feed, but they utilize the lipids and glycogen energy reserves stored in the body for their survival. we found genes involved in various pathways like fatty acid degradation, glycolysis, and glyoxalate in the ij transcriptome. all these three pathways catabolize energy reserves such as fatty acids and glucose and generate atps that are utilized for the ij survival. glyoxalate pathway has been known to be important for dauer stages of c. elegans  <cit>  and has also been reported in an epn, romanomermis  <cit> .

we found several signaling pathways in the transcriptome of h. indica ijs essential for nematode survival under stressed conditions and various other activities . some of these signaling pathways, such as pi3k-akt and mtor signaling pathways are involved in regulation of cell cycle and in mediating oxidative stress responses and extending the lifespan in the nematodes  <cit> . presence of other signaling pathways such as the mapk known to be involved in nematode response to various cellular and environmental stimuli including stresses and cell proliferation, regulation of fertilization in nematodes, especially sperm activation  <cit>  suggest that these signaling pathways might control the ij nematodes from being reproductive in the arrested stage. cgmp-pkg signaling is involved in olfactory sensing and behavior regulation in the nematodes  <cit>  and flies  <cit> , and pharyngeal pumping rate, mouth form dimorphism, the duration of forward locomotion, and the amount of fat stored in the intestine in necromenic insect associated nematode, pristionchus  <cit> . this indicated that the h. indica ijs also actively sense their environment and adapt their metabolism and behavior accordingly.

the analysis of the h. indica secretome identified several hydrolases, a large contingent of peptidases, kinases, phosphatases, and enzymes involved in stress responses. some of these enzymes are important for the degradation of insect cuticle, tissue, and hemocoel, whereas peptidases are also known to be involved in regulatory functions. the presence of a large number of kinases and phosphatases indicates vibrant signaling in the ij stage. all these findings suggest that although ij is a developmentally arrested stage; it is still a hotbed of signaling and is actively sensing its environment.

h. indica is a rhabditid as c. elegans, which shows the presence of  <dig> rnai pathway genes  <cit> . primary sequence similarity based search was carried out to identify putative orthologs of c. elegans rnai pathway genes in h. indica. we found  <dig> orthologs of c. elegans rnai pathway effector genes in h. indica ijs. the completed genome sequence of another species of the same genus, h. bacteriophora revealed the presence of only  <dig> rnai pathway genes  <cit>  indicating either incompleteness of the genome or false negatives because of poor annotation of h. bacteriophora genome. interestingly, the rnai pathways can differ significantly even amongst very closely related nematode species, as is evident by the fact that the number of rnai effector genes varied from  <dig> to  <dig> amongst different species of caenorhabditis spp.  <cit> . out of the four rnai effector genes present in most known parasitic nematodes, drsh- <dig>  rsd- <dig>  ego- <dig>  and smg- <dig> were present in h. indica ijs. however, ego- <dig> was absent in the two parasitic nematodes trichinella spiralis, and a. caninum  <cit> , suggesting that it is not universally present in parasitic nematodes as thought earlier. we found nrde- <dig> in h. indica ijs at a low stringency cutoff, which is responsible for nuclear translocation of rnai triggers in c. elegans, and is involved in processes that lead to the heritability of gene silencing events. the absence of nrde- <dig> in parasitic nematodes has led to speculations that silencing events cannot be passed between generations of parasitic nematodes  <cit> . however, sequences with loose homology to the c. elegans nrde- <dig> could be discovered in h. bacteriophora genome as well, suggesting that the absence of nrde- <dig> in h. bacteriophora might be a false negative caused by a failure to predict the h. bacteriophora nrde- <dig> gene. its presence in heterorhabditis nematodes indicated that the silencing events could probably be passed between generations, and opens up a whole new array for use of heterorhabditid nematodes as a model for epigenetic regulation of rnai pathways.

the sequence divergence between c. elegans and h. indica prevented discovery of c. elegans orthologs of important gene class members at a high stringency. by lowering the stringency of the blastn to 30 % identity and query coverage, we could identify several additional members of the various gene classes in h. indica, but these orthologs would need further validation. the h. indica transcriptome showed the presence of at least  <dig> flp,  <dig> nlp and  <dig> ins neuropeptide genes,  <dig> unc,  <dig> daf and  <dig>  far genes,  <dig> nhr, nine lec,  <dig> let but no lys gene class members . in the daf gene class, daf- <dig>  daf- <dig> and daf- <dig> were identified, all of which are important in dauer formation in c. elegans. daf- <dig> encodes a tgf-beta type i receptor homolog, which together with the tgf-β-like type ii receptor daf- <dig>  is required for the regulation of dauer formation by environmental signals . similarly, daf- <dig> encodes a member of the tgf-β superfamily; which is involved in signaling pathway that interprets environmental conditions to regulate energy balance pathways that affect dauer larval formation, fat metabolism, egg laying, feeding behavior and sperm motility . identification of several insulin-like peptide  genes proved the role of insulin signaling in ij formation and maintenance in h. indica. neuropeptides like flp and nlp are involved in environmental sensing by the nematode. in the flp gene class, flp- <dig>  flp- <dig>  flp- <dig>  flp- <dig>  flp- <dig> and flp- <dig> were the prominent members. in the recent years, flp genes are emerging as important targets for nematode management, and it has been shown that disruption of flp gene expression impaired nematode parasite’s ability to locate its host . other neuropeptides found in h. indica, like nlp- <dig>  has no known homologs in other nematode species  <cit> , whereas nlp- <dig> in c. elegans encodes four predicted neuropeptide-like proteins; and is expressed in a variety of neurons, spermatheca, the rectal gland, and the intestine  <cit> . another important protein class, nematode lectins, are protein molecules that bind to carbohydrate moieties. they are involved in cell-cell recognition and are important in nematode recognition of bacteria and innate immune responses against pathogens. nine members of the lec gene class were identified in h. indica including lec- <dig>  lec- <dig> encodes a 'proto' type galectin  containing a single carbohydrate recognition domain and is suggested to be important for cell adhesion and aggregation, proliferation, or programmed cell death in c. elegans . likewise, in h. indica, members of the lectin protein family might possibly be involved in recognition of the symbiont bacteria. similarly, tol- <dig> found expressing in h. indica ijs has been reported to be involved in behavioral responses to the pathogenic microbes by promoting the development of sensory neurons that monitor microbial metabolism and are required for a pathogen-avoidance behavior in c. elegans  <cit> . hence, it is possible that tol- <dig> could be involved in the maintenance of a specific symbiotic relationship between heterorhabditis nematodes with photorhabdus bacterium, but this hypothesis would need further testing.

CONCLUSIONS
here we presented a transcriptomic insight into the infective juvenile stage of the epn, h. indica. after using cd-hit-est and filtering out <300 bp transcripts, we have identified  <dig>  unique transcripts in h. indica infective juveniles.  <dig>  % of the proteins were similar to an animal parasite a. suum. we found that similar to c. elegans, all the four dauer formation pathways-cgmp-pkg signaling pathway, insulin signaling pathway, dafachronic acid pathway, and tgf-β were conserved in h. indica and were active in the ij stage of the nematode. several important signaling pathways were found active in the ijs indicating that despite being a developmentally arrested stage, ijs are a hotbed of signaling and are actively interacting with their environment. similarly, glycolysis and fatty acid degradation pathways were highly active in ijs indicating a breakdown of food reserves required for survival. twenty-four orthologs of c. elegans rnai pathway effector genes were found in h. indica ij transcriptome, including nrde- <dig> that has been identified in any of the parasitic worms for the first time. using a low stringency approach, we have identified several additional members of important gene classes in h. indica. our results and analysis lay down the groundwork for further functional genomic investigations on these gene classes in heterorhabditis nematodes.
