BACKGROUND
endogenous retroviruses  are the remnants of an exogenous viral form that infected and became integrated in germ cell genomes  <cit> . ervs have been found in a variety of vertebrates, including reptiles, amphibian, birds and mammals  <cit> . however, the occurrence and evolution of ervs in different organisms are still not well understood and they are sometimes lumped with "junk" dna of unknown function  <cit> .

in the domestic pig and wild boar  genome, ervs are referred to as pervs  and belong to the β and γ genera comprising several viral groups  <cit> . the γ <dig> genus is divided in perv-a, b and c classes on the basis of env sequences, while the γ <dig> genus comprises only perv-e. although most pervs carry mutations that render them functionally inactive, some γ <dig> pervs retain the ability to express and can infect human cells in vitro  <cit> . the capacity of γ <dig> ervs to infect human cells in tissue culture raised serious concerns on the safety of xenotransplantations  <cit>  because pigs are the first choice of xenograft donors  <cit> ; consequently γ <dig> ervs have been extensively studied in sus scrofa.

in contrast, few dna sequences from γ <dig> ervs have been reported to date  <cit> , although a full length provirus has been described and named perv-e because of its similarity to the human herv-e. furthermore, perv-e forms a distinct clade with viruses from the herv-e family and does not cluster with γ <dig> pervs  <cit> . genetic and expression analyses also have not indicated an obvious infectious risk from γ <dig> retroviruses for xenotransplantation  <cit> .

at present, little is known about either γ <dig> or γ <dig> ervs in other suid species than sus scrofa  <cit> . patience et al.  <cit>  screened by pcr for the presence of ervs  in five different suid species, while niebert and tönjes  <cit>  sequenced γ <dig> dna fragments in seven different suid species. however, they did not perform any evolutionary analyses of ervs  <cit> . clearly both of these studies have left many questions unanswered.

the mechanisms by which γ <dig> ervs increase their copy number in suid genomes are also poorly understood and three main mechanisms have been reported for human ervs   <cit> ; retrotransposition in cis, complementation in trans, and reinfection  <cit> . the first mechanism involves replication by co-packaging mrnas in virus-like particles built up from viral proteins encoded by their own gag and pol genes. as retrotransposition in cis does not result in cell to cell translocation, the env gene is not required to be functional. conversely, complementation in trans involves replication of two retroviral elements of the same family, with one defective provirus using the functional protein produced by another provirus. finally, ervs might form infectious exogenous particles and reinfect either a germ cell or a somatic cell. because reinfection requires the translocation of viruses from one cell to another, the presence of functional genes is required, although this may also result from complementation in trans  <cit> . new ervs will likely acquire new mutations during reinfection or retrotransposition due to their error prone reverse transcriptase in virus replication  <cit> . thus proviruses might occasionally give rise to infectious exogenous forms which can reinfect the animal itself or animals of the same species and sometimes cross to other species, and subsequently integrate in a germ cell  <cit> .

recently a study of the host phylogeny  <cit>  clarified the relationship between eurasian and african suids based on nuclear and mitochondrial dna sequences, enabling the study of erv evolution in these suid species and the evolutionary congruence of host and viral lineages. here, we analyzed the γ <dig> erv coding domains  sampled from  <dig> different suid host species from eurasia and africa. we have analyzed their evolutionary relationships as well as their likely mechanism of replication. we have also compared the evolution of γ <dig> and γ <dig> ervs using their env genes and implication for xenotransplantation.

RESULTS
screening of erv sequences
a total of  <dig> partial γ <dig> erv sequences comprising the pol, gag and env  genes and  <dig> γ <dig> env were generated . one individual for each suid species was analyzed, except for the babirusa, where two animals were analyzed for env class e. no γ <dig> erv genes were amplified in the babirusa, while pol and env class a and c were not amplified in the forest hog, and pol and env class a were not amplified in the javan warty pig and the desert warthog, respectively. we were able to amplify γ <dig> ervs in all of the species.

+ after reorganization of sequences 

* two animals were analyzed.

blastn confirmed that amplicons corresponded to ervs. primers targeting env classes a and c cross amplified. sequences generated with these primers were initially analyzed together and then separated into a and c according to blastn results. after reorganization, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> sequences for class a and c env were analyzed. env class c was not amplified from any african specimens, obviating the need for the non-parametric test for panmixia for this gene.

three gag and one env class e sequences showed indels longer than  <dig> bp and were removed from alignments to increase accuracy of evolutionary analysis. this allowed a higher number of base pairs to be analyzed because these indels were observed in different positions. after removing these sequences, a total of  <dig> novel γ <dig> sequences were analyzed along with  <dig> sequences from the draft pig genome and  <dig> sequences from genbank . these sequences showed a pairwise genetic distances in expected number of substitutions per site ranging from  <dig> -  <dig>  for pol,  <dig> -  <dig>  for gag,  <dig> -  <dig>  for env class a,  <dig> -  <dig>  for env class b, and  <dig> -  <dig>  for env class c. identical sequences were rarely observed, and they mainly reflect identical sequences from genbank and between genbank and sus scrofa genome sequences. non-parametric tests revealed highly significant differentiation between ervs from african versus eurasian species . on the other hand, no sequence was removed from γ <dig> env dataset for which pairwise genetic distances ranged from  <dig>  -  <dig> . the non-parametric test of population subdivision suggested that eurasian, african and babirusa sequences came from different subpopulations .

in addition, most dna sequences of γ <dig> erv genes lacked stop codons or, when present, were limited to one stop codon per sequence. this contrasted with γ <dig> env, which possessed several stop codons  and the presence of several indels, some of which were in unique positions and others at conserved positions across eurasian, african and babirusa sequences, suggesting that they are unlikely to be replicating as env is necessary for viral reinfection. possibly, they might retrotranspose in cis if other coding domains were devoid of stop codons, although this is apparently unlikely because sus scrofa gag and pro/pol also showed stop codons and frame shift mutations. interestingly, there were three γ <dig> sequences from african species  and two from babirusa that did not show stop codons.

test for detecting recombination
from 30% to 79% of sequences were identified as recombinants for γ <dig> genes by the rdp  <dig> software  <cit>  including some apparent inter-group recombinants . this program also identifies recombination breakpoints, which for our dataset were located at different positions when the aligned viral sequences are compared. because of that, the intervening non-recombinant fragments of sequence were not useful for phylogenetic reconstructions because more than 50% of sequence length had to be removed from the alignment. furthermore, in most cases, sequences identified as non-recombinant were not representative of the different suid species available in our dataset. we therefore did not use the non-recombinants identified by rdp  <dig> for phylogenetic reconstructions.

from 17% to 40% of sequences were identified as recombinants for γ <dig> genes by the phi-nnet algorithm  <cit> , and a higher frequency was mainly observed in sequences from african suids but less frequently than with rdp  <dig> . apparent inter-group recombinants between eurasian and african sequences were identified only for env, albeit with a low frequency . it is interesting to note that approximately 50% of env class a sequences in african suids appeared to be recombinants  while all env class c sequences, found only in eurasian pigs, were likely to be recombinants and thus could not be used for evolutionary analyses. because this algorithm identified a smaller number of recombinants, we used the observed non-recombinant dataset in our phylogenetic reconstructions.

because approximately 50% of recombinants were observed for γ <dig> env, with even some apparent inter-group recombinants detected by the phi-nnet algorithm , the non-parametric test was re-run using only the non-recombinant dataset. in this case, the null hypothesis of panmixia could not be rejected , providing no conclusive evidence that γ <dig> ervs from eurasian and african species and babirusa represent different retroviral subpopulations.

phylogeny reconstructions
in the suidae, γ <dig> ervs are grouped into two different lineages, one in eurasian and another in african suids, as indicated by class a and b env phylogenies . furthermore, the pol phylogeny revealed five groups, four comprising only sequences from eurasian species, and another mainly with african species in a well defined clade . however, one γ <dig> pol sequence present in the draft pig genome grouped with γ <dig> pol sequences of african suids. this sequence was identified as a recombinant by the rdp  <dig> software but not by the phi-nnet algorithm.

the clades shown for african class a and b env phylogenies  were generally coincident with african host clades, except for the internal arrangement of potamochoerus porcus and hylochoerus meinertzhageni in the env class b phylogeny , which differed from the host tree  <cit>  where hylochoerus grouped with phacochoerus instead of potamochoerus. on the other hand, eurasian γ <dig> ervs showed a less conserved arrangement in all phylogenies, with internal groups not corresponding to the host phylogeny  <cit>  except for the env class b internal arrangement, which was very similar in the host phylogeny .

the gag phylogeny did not group all african ervs in a single clade, although most of them were still different from eurasian ones . a similar pattern is also observed when recombinant sequences detected by rdp  <dig> are also removed from phylogenetic analysis . this suggests that recombination is not responsible for the lack of resolution on gag. further conclusions based solely on gag should be carefully evaluated. furthermore, these sequences did not show substitution saturation, with iss much smaller than the critical iss value  <cit> .

conversely, bayesian analysis for γ <dig> suid ervs showed a bush-like pattern  with short internal and long external branches. the same pattern was observed using neighbor-joining, and also with the complete sequence dataset , suggesting that for γ <dig> ervs, recombinants were not responsible for the star-like phylogeny. an unresolved phylogeny may also result from data saturation, although γ <dig> env showed very low saturation, with iss =  <dig> , below the critical iss value   <cit> . similar results were obtained for first, second and third codon positions. furthermore, the likelihood-mapping method indicated that the data contain a high amount of net-like  and star-like  signals, indicating that the tree was not well resolved according to the criteria of strimmer and von haeseler  <cit> .

mechanism of erv proliferation
most sequences of γ <dig> ervs did not possess stop codons and/or indels. furthermore, when present, they were usually located at unique positions in any given sequence. low frequency of stop codons is evidence that complementation in trans has been a rare event  <cit> .

estimates of ω for each branch in the phylogeny were used for testing the possibility of purifying selection  <cit> . comparisons of internal branches with external branches  suggested that purifying selection was acting on all genes because of the highly significant differences in log-likelihoods . furthermore, ω was significantly smaller for internal branches than for external branches:  <dig>  and  <dig>  for gag,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for pol,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for env class a, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  for env class b .

for the γ <dig> env gene, we found statistical support for the "one-ratio" model , which made testing the "two-ratio" model unnecessary.

discussion
we found strong evidence that γ <dig> ervs from eurasian and african species based on the pol and env phylogenies belong to two different lineages. this pattern was also observed for ltr phylogenies sampled from eurasian and african host species  <cit> . host species from eurasia are more similar to one another, showing shorter branch lengths compared to the more differentiated african host species with longer branch lengths, consistent with traditional taxonomy which puts all eurasian species in the genus sus, whereas there are several genera recognized in africa  <cit> . a similar pattern was generally observed in γ <dig> erv class a and b env phylogenies and for the ltrs, suggesting that proviruses might be codiverging with their respective host species.

the resolution of the pol phylogeny into distinct eurasian and african lineages, which was not found with gag, is not a consequence of analysis of longer alignments. bayesian analysis based on  <dig> bp of pol sequence  showed an almost identical topology to that observed in figure  <dig>  showing a single african clade of ervs . similarly, when ca.  <dig> bp of env is analysed, an almost identical topology of that of figure  <dig> is also observed  <cit> .

the gag phylogeny is different from the other viral gene phylogenies and to the host phylogeny  <cit> . this may be explained by the gene tree versus species tree problem in which gene phylogenies sometimes conflict with a species tree because individual gene sequences can generate different topologies and consequently conflicting results  <cit> , but is also likely to be due simply to the lack of resolution in the gag phylogeny which cannot be attributed to the length of base pairs analysed compared to the other genes. the lack of resolution of this gene was also observed by other authors when analysing other retroviruses . alternatively, the dna sequence conservation of gag gene suggests that gag proteins are important for viral replication. experimental analysis of moloney murine leukemia virus showed that mutations of several portions of gag were incompatible with viral replication  <cit> , implying strong selection for conservation of the gag gene sequence. in this case, while other viral domains might have evolved distinct african and eurasian sequences, gag might have been constrained from doing so.

class a and b env phylogenies showed two likely subpopulations in african suids, one in phacochoerus species, and another in potamochoerus and hylochoerus species more related to ervs from sus species, . amplification of orthologous sequences as well as full length proviral sequences would provide a better basis for comparison, but for reasons of practicality and convenience paralogous sequences amplified by pcr have been routinely used to determine the evolutionary relationship of ervs in different host species  <cit> .

recombination was apparent in several γ <dig> and γ <dig> sequences, presumably as a result of co-packaging of different rnas in the same viral particle. in sus scrofa, recombination between highly variable env sequences is easier to detect than for gag and pol. moreover, selection would be also more likely to be operating on env than on the other genes because the viral envelope must evolve to escape immune detection, thus making recombination a likely source of adaptative phenotypes. ervs from african species showed more evidence of recombination than ervs from eurasian species, although this apparent difference may be an artifact of the higher differentiation  for pol and for class a and b env in african species. furthermore, the rdp  <dig> software identified a higher number of recombinants than the phi-nnet algorithm for γ <dig> genes, a fact also observed in hiv by lamers et al.  and attributed to the molecular models implemented in some rdp  <dig> methods, to the number of sequences in each analysis and to variation within each subpopulation altering the number of identified recombinants  <cit> . this might be why the γ <dig> pol sequence from the draft pig genome was identified as recombinant by rdp  <dig> and non-recombinant by the phi-nnet algorithm. these discordances obviously result from the different methods of analyses, pointing to the need of improving their consistency and power especially in detecting recombinants between erv sequences. this improvement is also important to better characterize the inter subpopulation recombinants observed in this study and confirm that they represent genuine recombinant sequences.

we also found evidence for past purifying selection on all γ <dig> genes. this suggested that retroviruses that remained functional were initially selected and that transposition by reinfection was relevant, while loss of function would have likely resulted in neutral evolution within the host genome ω ≈  <dig>  furthermore, the rarity of stop codons and/or indels also suggested that complementation in trans and retrotransposition in cis were not relevant mechanisms of transposition  <cit> .

evolutionary comparisons of γ <dig> and γ <dig> env genes
in contrast to the γ <dig> phylogeny, γ <dig> erv env gene showed a bush-like unresolved tree,  confirmed by the likelihood-mapping, either resulting from inadequate sampling or data  or reflecting the actual evolutionary history of γ <dig> ervs in the suidae   <cit> . the bush-like pattern might reflect an incomplete sampling because env from ten other suid species is missing in the phylogeny. however, the γ <dig> erv env phylogenies  using fewer species showed a better resolved tree with species from eurasia grouping apart from african suids, suggesting that the number of viral sequences samples from each suid host would not be an explanation for the poor resolution of γ <dig> erv env phylogeny.

an unresolved phylogeny, like that observed for γ <dig> ervs, may also result from data saturation, but the env sequences showed very low saturation. although we cannot rule out the possibility that the γ <dig> star-like phylogeny resulted from inadequate sampling, this seems unlikely as samples used here were available from ervs from three different suid lineages observed by nascimento  <cit> . in this case, a hard polytomy seems more plausible. although vandamme  <cit>  emphasised the difficulty of proving the existence of hard polytomies in real life, poe and chubb  <cit> , barth et al.  <cit> , willerslev et al.  <cit>  and several others  <cit>  have observed some apparent examples in different taxa, including birds, mammals, plants and protozoa, and this pattern was also observed for human ervs  <cit> .

this hard polytomy may then represent a rapid radiation from a single common ancestor giving rise to multiple distinct retroviral lineages almost at the same time  <cit> . these ervs have subsequently become inactivated resulting in the loss of the last active lineage , following a long period of inactivity leading to the star shaped phylogeny  <cit> .

the reason why distinct evolutionary histories are observed for γ <dig> and γ <dig> ervs is not known. it would be reasonable to attribute it to the evolution of the host defensive mechanisms. however, katzourakis et al.  <cit>  by modelling erv evolutionary dynamics demonstrated that such a star shaped phylogeny can be generated by a "null model" in which all parameters are set constant through out time.

CONCLUSIONS
the different lineages of γ <dig> ervs in the suidae are generally congruent with the host phylogeny. this implies that horizontal transmission across these very different host lineages has not occurred. moreover, the frequent evolutionary occurrence of viral recombination may be relevant to risk analysis of xenotransplantation, especially since viral recombination will favour adaptation and confer capacity for maintaining ongoing infection of somatic and germ cells. this highlights the importance of improving methods to prevent pervs from crossing the species barriers. finally, the evolution of γ <dig> ervs confirms their lack of risk in xenotransplantation because the star phylogeny suggests loss of the last active element which is also confirmed by the presence of numerous stop codons.
