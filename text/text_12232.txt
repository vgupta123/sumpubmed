BACKGROUND
genomics is beginning to make an impact on animal breeding, by providing dna markers linked to genes affecting phenotypic traits. such markers can be used in marker-assisted selection , selection based partly or fully on dna marker genotypes. among the traits relevant for mas, disease resistance traits are of particular interest, since the phenotypic measurement of these traits is often difficult or expensive and may cause animal suffering.

in aquaculture, disease resistance traits are of particular importance. in intensive culture systems, opportunities for avoidance or escape are minimal. furthermore, interactions between fish and microbial pathogens that may be harmless under natural conditions often result in disease problems in aquaculture systems because of the added stress from biological, physical and chemical factors  <cit> . in contrast to farm animals, the animal strains used in aquaculture are usually very recent derivatives of wild strains  <cit> , and therefore have had little time to adapt to the new disease pressures.

the atlantic salmon  is, as its relative the rainbow trout , an important species in modern aquaculture. in the wild, this carnivorous species spends its first 2– <dig> years in fresh water, but migrates to the sea following the salt-water-acclimatising process known as smoltification. the animal spends  <dig> to  <dig> years in the ocean, and then returns to its home river to spawn, burying the eggs in the gravel substrate. the recently hatched fish, termed alevins, live of their yolk sack before they enter the fry stage and emerge from the substrate. the fresh/salt-water  life-style of the fish is reflected in aquaculture production, where the fish spend their first 1/ <dig> to  <dig> year in freshwater tanks and  <dig> to  <dig> years in sea cages until they reach market size.

pathogens are a major problem in salmonid farming as in other areas of aquaculture. in european production of atlantic salmon, the viral disease infectious pancreatic necrosis , caused by a double-stranded rna virus, has for some time ranked among the diseases causing the largest losses  <cit> . in farmed atlantic salmon, the disease causes mortality at both the freshwater  stage and at the post-smolt stage shortly after transfer to seawater. the disease causes necrosis of pancreatic cells and liver cells, resulting in lethargy and sudden mortality. ipn is an endemic disease that affected 40–70% of all norwegian seawater salmon-farming sites during the years 1994– <dig>  and 30–40% of freshwater hatcheries during the same period  <cit> . mortality during outbreaks has been estimated to be 10–20% on average, varying from zero to almost 100% at individual sites  <cit> . vaccines against ipn have been developed and are being used, but the protection is variable and not complete  <cit> . in the wild, the virus does not seem to cause mortalities, although wild fish may be carriers of the virus.

the atlantic salmon has been vital to the application of modern animal breeding to aquaculture. in the early 1970s, a breeding programme was established in norway, based on fish from different norwegian rivers  <cit> . later, other breeding programmes have been initiated in several countries  <cit> . typical traits under selection are growth rate, age at sexual maturation, filet colour and other quality traits, as well as disease resistance traits. selection for disease resistance may be based on field trials or on controlled challenge tests, but in either case, challenge-tested fish are not allowed as breeding candidates, and the breeding values of the candidates are based solely on survival rates of siblings and other relatives. criteria for direct selection among candidates, in the form of quantitative trait loci  for resistance against various diseases, have been sought after for some time in atlantic salmon and rainbow trout  <cit> . of particular relevance for ipn in atlantic salmon was a recent report on the mapping of qtl for resistance against ipn in post-smolts of scottish origin, based on data from a field trial  <cit> . in that study, a major qtl was detected that explained 21% of the phenotypic variation in the data set. the qtl was found to be unusually reproducible in the population, segregating in  <dig> out of  <dig> mapping parents investigated.

here, we report on results from a project that has been running partly in parallel with the scottish study, reproducing the finding of one major qtl by means of a genome scan on salmon of norwegian origin. we also present the testing of the qtl at the fry stage and the fine-mapping and further characterisation of the qtl in an extensive genetic material. the results represent, within aquaculture, a rare example of an investigation of a qtl at the level of an entire breeding population, yielding results that are directly applicable for mas within that population.

RESULTS
phenotypic data
ten large full-sib groups of post-smolt from a norwegian breeding company  were ipn-challenged-tested by cohabitant challenge in two tanks. the survival curves were found to be very similar across the two tanks, and followed the expected trajectories for an ipn challenge . the overall mortalities in the two tanks were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. mortality rates of individual families ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % .

genome scan
a genome scan was performed using the  <dig> first to die and  <dig> of the survivors  within each full-sib family, as well as genotypes on  <dig> microsatellite markers spanning most of the atlantic salmon genome . the information content was relatively high in most regions . two genome-wide significant qtl for ipn resistance were identified, one having a major effect and one having a more minor effect. in addition, several suggestive qtl were identified . the major qtl, located on linkage group  <dig>  was responsible for  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation in the data set, translating into  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation after selective genotyping had been taken into account, and consequently  <dig> % of the genetic variation. the one other genome-wide significant qtl was located on linkage group  <dig>  and was responsible for  <dig> % of the genetic variation after selective genotyping had been taken into account.

†p ≈  <dig> 

qtl were defined as suggestive if they were chromosome-wise significant at p <  <dig> , while not experiment-wise significant at p <  <dig> . the f ratio has degrees of freedom equal to the number of informative parents and the number of records  minus two times the number of informative parents  <cit> ; the latter ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> depending on the number of marker-informative offspring. the proportion of phenotypic variance is the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the qtl, after correction for selective genotyping.

linkage-based fine-mapping of major qtl using post-smolts
to more precisely define the position of the major qtl on linkage group  <dig>   <dig> additional microsatellite markers were genotyped in the post-smolt individuals . the most likely qtl position was found to be at  <dig> cm, with the 95% confidence interval for position being at 23– <dig> cm . the qtl now explained 29% of the phenotypic variation after correcting for selective genotyping, translating into 83% of the genetic variation. out of the  <dig> mapping parents,  <dig> were found to be qtl heterozygous . out of the  <dig> qtl heterozygous parents, seven were notably more significant  than the three others .

amarkers used in the genome scan

test of qtl-effect in fry
challenge-tested fry, full-sibs of the post-smolts used for the genome scan, were genotyped to investigate whether the qtl had the same effect at the fry stage as at the post-smolt stage, the disease causing mortalities at these two quite different life stages. chi-square tests performed on groups of fry corresponded well with chi-square tests performed on their post-smolt siblings . of the  <dig> mapping parents found to be qtl heterozygous based on post-smolt data, seven were identified as qtl heterozygous in fry; these were the seven being most significant for the qtl in post-smolts. vice versa, one parent was found to be qtl heterozygous based on fry data but not on post-smolt data, although it was close to being declared qtl heterozygous in the post-smolt test as well .

linkage-based fine-mapping of major qtl using fry
the results had indicated that the major qtl had similar effects on fry as on post-smolts, meaning that genetic material from the fry challenge tests, in which all families in the aqua gen breeding nucleus had been tested, could be used to fine map and further characterise the qtl. consequently,  <dig> additional full-sib groups of challenge-tested fry, representing  <dig> parents, were genotyped using markers located on linkage group  <dig>  the position of the qtl based on fry data corresponded well with the position based on post-smolt data, the 95% confidence interval for position being at 19– <dig> cm . the qtl explained  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation in the data set following correction for selective genotyping, translating into  <dig> % of the genetic variation. out of  <dig> mapping parents,  <dig> were found to be segregating the qtl . combined linkage disequilibrium/linkage analysis  was performed, but could not add to the precision of the qtl position estimate . it should be noted that fry were not scanned for qtl outside of linkage group  <dig>  thus, qtl located outside this linkage group, having an effect on fry but not on post-smolts, could not be detected.

test for population-level association between markers and the underlying polymorphism
levels of linkage disequilibrium  between markers in the qtl region showed that there was significant ld between closely linked markers on the linkage group as a whole . within the qtl region, inter-marker r <dig> values as high as  <dig>  were found . these findings indicated that there could be substantial ld between markers in the qtl region and the polymorphism underlying the qtl. therefore, markers in the qtl region, as well as haplotypes made from these markers, were tested for their ability to predict alleles at the underlying polymorphism. this analysis was based on the  <dig> parents found to be qtl heterozygous, since alleles at the underlying polymorphism, and the linkage phases between alleles at the underlying polymorphism and marker alleles, were known for these parents. a four-marker haplotype was found to be the best predictor of alleles at the underlying polymorphism ; out of  <dig> alleles found among the  <dig> qtl heterozygous parents at this haplotype, only three were not exclusively linked to either q  or q  . when linkage phases deduced between q/q and the four-marker haplotype alleles were extrapolated on the  <dig> remaining mapping parents with known haplotypes ,  <dig> parents were found to be qq,  <dig> were qq, and  <dig> were qq. thus, a significant homozygote excess  was found among the parents that were a priori believed to be qtl homozygous based on linkage analysis . taken together, these results showed that the four-marker haplotype was a good, but not perfect, indicator of allele at the underlying polymorphism. they also gave credit to the one-gene, two-allele model that had implicitly been assumed.

characterisation of the underlying polymorphism at the population level
we now were in a position where we could characterise the segregation of the underlying gene at the population level. an additional  <dig> animals from among the  <dig> broodstock  were therefore genotyped for the four-marker haplotype. unphased haplotype data from these animals were combined with phased data from the  <dig> previously investigated mapping parents to deduce haplotypes at the population level, whereupon alleles at the underlying polymorphism were inferred on the basis of haplotypes found in qq animals . for  <dig> out of a total of  <dig> genotyped broodstock animals, both alleles at the underlying polymorphism could be deduced . of these,  <dig> were qq,  <dig> were qq, and  <dig> were qq, leading to a population level allele frequency estimate for q of  <dig> . genotype at the underlying polymorphism had a highly significant  effect on survival rates of offspring, with the average progeny mortality rates for parents with the qq, qq, and qq genotypes being  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively . the dominance effect was non-significant, indicating a purely additive mode of inheritance. the genotype of the underlying polymorphism was responsible for 23% of the trait variance in this test.

discussion
the genome scan for qtl affecting ipn resistance confirmed a major qtl explaining nearly all of the genetic variation for this trait. this implies that, in this population, the genetic component of resistance to ipn is largely under the control of one qtl, presumably corresponding to one gene, a surprising find given that disease resistance traits are generally presumed to be complex. the results agree remarkably well with the other study identifying a major qtl for ipn-resistance in atlantic salmon  <cit> . in both studies the qtl explained ~25% of the phenotypic variation, it segregated in a large fraction of mapping parents , and the estimated qtl positions were highly similar. only a single marker  was shared between the two studies in the vicinity of the qtl, but the position of this marker relative to the qtl peak was very consistent. thus, it seems reasonable to assume that the two studies have in fact identified one and the same qtl.

in terms of the minor qtl identified, on the other hand, the overlap between the two studies was less striking. in the scottish study, one other genome-wide significant qtl was detected, located on linkage group  <dig>  in addition to a chromosome-wide significant qtl in linkage group  <dig>  of these, only the qtl on linkage group  <dig> was found to be harbour a  qtl in the present work . the one other genome-significant qtl identified in the present study was identified on linkage group  <dig>  these differences could be due to differences between the populations studied, with some polymorphisms segregating in one populnation but not in others, or they could be related to sampling since each population was represented by only a limited number of mapping parents in the genome scans. also, one cannot rule out that some of the qtl could be false positives.

the major qtl on linkage group  <dig> was found to explain a large fraction of the phenotypic variance in both the post-smolt and fry data sets. in general, the fraction of variance explained by a qtl detected in a genome scan tends to be overestimated due to the so-called beavis effect  <cit> . it should be noted, however, that the beavis effect gets less severe as the experimental power increases and as the observed fraction of variance increases. thus, our own calculations based on the formulas presented by xu  <cit>  showed that, for a qtl explaining 28% of the genetic variation, the bias would be almost negligible even if only  <dig> offspring had been genotyped. similarly, given the sample sizes of this study, the upward bias would be insignificant even for qtl of very minor effects. we would argue that the fraction of variance explained by the major qtl on linkage group  <dig> is more likely to have been underestimated, since the correction for selective genotyping assumes that the 9% least and 9% most resistant post-smolts were genotyped, while in reality the set of "most resistant animals" was drawn randomly from the ~25% of animals that survived within each family. the fraction of genetic variance explained by the qtl on the post-smolt stage was calculated on the basis of the heritability estimated in fry, since a good estimate of the heritability at the post-smolt stage was not available. the heritabilities at the two life stages are not necessarily identical.

body weight has been found to be correlated with immune functions in some studies , an argument for the use of body weight as a covariate in analysis for disease resistance qtl. in this study, individual fish could only be weighed during or after the challenge test, and we were thus not able to include weight as a covariate in the test for qtl . we did, however, analyse the data for body weight qtl, using the 'affected/resistant' status of the fish as a fixed effect in that analysis . linkage group  <dig> was found not to harbour experiment-wide significant qtl for body weight, meaning that the observed qtl for ipn resistance is not a correlated effect of a qtl for body weight.

for ease of presentation, segregation data from male and female mapping parents were combined in qtl analysis, but only female map distances were used. in large parts of the atlantic salmon genome, recombination does not occur in males  <cit> , meaning that males do not contribute to the local positioning of qtls in such regions. in other regions, male recombination rates are very high relative to female recombination rates. the f curves for linkage group  <dig> exemplify these particularities well; the sharp increase in the f statistic between omm <dig> and omi27tuf is caused by these two markers being genetically unlinked in males, even though the female genetic distance between them is only  <dig> cm. for other parts of the linkage group, no male recombination events were found in the whole data set.

the major qtl for ipn-resistance on linkage group  <dig> had a strong effect in both post-smolts and in fry. these are very distinct life stages, given that fry live in fresh water and post-smolts in salt water. the overlapping confidence intervals for qtl position and the concurrence of qtl genotypes and linkage phases between fry and post-smolt stages strongly indicates that the same gene controls ipn resistance at both life stages, although one cannot rule out that two different, but linked genes determine resistance at the two life stages. a functioning adaptive immune system is most probably developed at a later stage than that of the experimental fish in the fry test  <cit> , indicating that the gene underlying the qtl is likely to pertain to the innate immune system. controlled challenge tests represent somewhat of an 'artificial' environment compared to natural farming conditions, and may lack certain natural stressors that could influence the pattern of resistance to a pathogen. the major qtl on linkage group  <dig>  however, does not appear to be affected by such environmental effects, since it was found to have a large effect both in a field trial  <cit>  and in an experimental trial.

according to inter-marker levels of r <dig>  the extent of linkage disequilibrium increase with decreasing inter-marker distance from  <dig> cm. the increase in ld with decreasing distance is more pronounced in this study than in an earlier study, where the post-smolt mapping families were used to calculate levels of ld across all linkage groups  <cit> . this is probably due to a higher density of markers being used in the present study relative to the previous study. in spite of significant amounts of ld being present between markers in the qtl region, combined linkage disequilibrium/linkage analysis  could not increase the qtl mapping resolution . possibly, the marker density in the qtl region needs to be increased before the qtl can be positioned with significantly more accuracy. at present, additional markers in the qtl region are not available.

based on four-marker haplotypes found in qtl-heterozygous parents, putative genotypes at the underlying polymorphism were deduced in parents that had been found negative in the test for qtl. as expected, a highly significant surplus of homozygous genotypes was found, although there were  <dig> discrepancies in the form of parents that were negative in the test for qtl while being subsequently deduced to have the heterozygous genotype. of these  <dig> parents, four carried copies of the three haplotypes alleles that were ambiguous in terms of being linked to q or q. these four, therefore, were more likely to be true homozygotes representing ambiguous haplotypes. for the remaining nine parents, no apparent reason for their discrepancy could be found.

the qtl for ipn-resistance has now been detected in two different populations, norwegian and scottish, with high heterozygosity observed in both. this raises the interesting question of how an allele with a highly negative effect on a trait can be retained in populations at such large frequencies . one possible explanation is that the low-resistance allele has a positive effect on another trait under natural or artificial selection in these populations. this hypothesis, however, is opposed by an almost complete lack of observed negative genetic correlations between ipn-resistance and other traits recorded by aqua gen and other breeding companies. more specifically, among  <dig> recorded traits ipn resistance was found to be negatively and significantly correlated with only one trait. the trait in question was not among those that have been under strong selection, and the  correlation was also not strong  . it is quite possible, therefore, that this qtl is neutral under wild conditions, but non-neutral within an aquaculture setting. disease pressures are highly different within these two settings, and ipn-resistance has in norway been subject to artificial selection for at most two salmon generations, with only family selection being employed and ipn being only one of several traits in the breeding goals; probably not strong enough selection for large changes in allele frequency to occur.

given that a single qtl explains such a large proportion of the genetic variance for this trait, it is reasonable to assume that the high-resistance allele will move towards fixation relatively rapidly even without mas, although mas can accelerate the process significantly, or permit more focus to be put on other traits without compromising the genetic gain for ipn resistance. some researchers might argue that loss of phenotype-affecting genetic variation should be avoided, even if the allele going towards extinction has not been found to have positive effects on other traits. in such a case, the marker tools described in this paper could be used to deliberately retain the low-resistance allele at low frequency in the population.

the qtl presented here has been in use in the aqua gen breeding programme since  <dig>  when within-family mas was done on  <dig> half-sib groups in order to select the most ipn-resistant fish as parents of the elite fish . at the time, mas could only be done within family, and only within offspring of parents that had already been screened for segregation of the qtl. presently, mas could be done on the bulk of the population using linkage information, since qtl genotypes and marker-qtl linkage phases were established for 72% of the parents of the current generation . there is also a potential for mas based on linkage disequilibrium, since haplotypes were found that were associated with the underlying gene at the population level. however, the markers contributing to the haplotype cover a  <dig> cm interval, and are not likely to be stable over generations. thus, there is a need to further characterise the qtl in order to obtain the most efficient tool for mas, and to uncover the gene that is underlying this trait. recent development in genomics, including an atlantic salmon snp-chip containing  <dig>  snps developed at the centre of integrative genetics , could prove highly useful in this respect. also, samples of aqua gen broodstock dating as far back as the early 1980s will be investigated in order to test the hypothesis of the high-resistance allele having increased in frequency due to aquaculture breeding.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the study described here led to the confirmation and fine-mapping of a major qtl for resistance against the viral disease ipn in atlantic salmon. alleles at haplotypes, constructed from microsatellite markers located in the qtl region, were found to be associated with resistance at the population level, providing a tool for mas at the population level. to our knowledge, this is the first tool for ld-based tool for mas developed in any aquaculture species. further studies are now progressing, aiming at the identification of the underlying polymorphism.
