BACKGROUND
cell-free protein synthesis  systems based on crude lysates provide several advantages over in vivo systems and offer broad applications in protein engineering, biopharmaceutical product development and post-genomic research  <cit> . crude lysates contain the necessary components for translation, protein folding, and energy metabolism, so providing them with amino acids, energy substrates, nucleotides and salts allows almost any protein encoded by a rna template to be synthesized. in coupled transcription/translation systems supplemented additionally with an appropriate rna polymerase dna templates can also be used. in contrast to traditional cell-based expression methods, cfps offers shorter process times, limited protein hydrolysis and the ability to express toxic proteins or proteins containing specific chemical groups or unnatural amino acids at defined positions  <cit> . furthermore, the open nature of the system allows the reaction to be controlled and monitored directly. although chemical synthesis allows the rapid and controlled synthesis of peptides <  <dig> residues in length, this is not an economically feasible method for the production of larger proteins  <cit> .

the most widely used cell-free systems are based on escherichia coli extract , wheat germ extract , rabbit reticulocytes lysate  and insect cell extract . these contain diverse cellular components and co-factors that enhance protein expression, folding and modification in different ways. therefore, the most appropriate system will depend on the origin and the biochemical nature of the target protein. the preparation of ece is simple and inexpensive, and generally achieves the highest protein yields, from hundreds of micrograms to milligrams per milliliter in batch reactions depending on the target protein  <cit> . in contrast, eukaryotic systems are less productive and extract preparation is more laborious, but complex proteins can be produced more efficiently and extended post-translational modifications are supported. wge normally yields tens of micrograms to milligrams of recombinant protein per milliliter, depending on the protein and reaction format  <cit> , but extract preparation takes 4– <dig> d, and the yield of extract from wheat seeds is low  <cit> . the yields of rll systems are typically two orders of magnitude lower than wge  <cit>  and ices prepared from spodoptera frugiperda can achieve yields of up to 50 μg/ml  <cit> . recently two further eukaryotic systems based on cho cells  <cit>  and saccharomyces cerevisae <cit>  have been described. the cho extract yield up to 50 μg/ml active firefly luciferase, but the fermentation medium is quit expensive. in contrast the preparation of the yeast extract is inexpensive, but the system produces only low target protein levels of 8 μg/ml active firefly luciferase. the drawbacks of current cell-free systems have therefore created a demand for highly-productive eukaryotic cell-free systems that can be prepared quickly in large amounts.

here we describe a highly-productive in vitro translation system derived from tobacco by- <dig> cells. this type of cells was used due to the eukaryotic nature, the simple and cost-effective fermentation and the well-established genetic modification tools. the novel system was tested against commercial wges for the production of three model proteins: enhanced yellow fluorescent protein , firefly luciferase  and renilla reniformis luciferase . by measuring the activity of these optical reporter proteins, the rate of translation was determined without radioactive substrates. several different 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions were also compared for their translation enhancing activity.

RESULTS
preparation of the tobacco bright yellow- <dig> lysate 
at present in vitro translation systems suffer from certain shortages like laborious extract preparation, low protein synthesis yields or the inability to support posttranslational modifications  <cit> . the aim of this study was to establish a system, allowing the rapid preparation of lysates for cell-free synthesis of satisfactory recombinant protein yields. for this purpose, we further developed a system based on by- <dig> cell suspension cultures designed for the replication of plant rna viruses  <cit> . in contrast to the original protocol using batch-cultured cells, we used by- <dig> cells growing continuously in a stirred-tank fermenter at a constant packed cell volume of 20% and a doubling time of around 32 h, to ensure a reproducible supply of homogeneous cell material. we also replaced the conventional cell wall-digesting enzymes  with the liquid enzymes rohament cl, rohament pl and rohapect uf, originally intended for the production of fruit juice and extracts. rohament cl comprises a cellulase concentrate, rohament pl is a pectinase concentrate, and rohapect uf contains an enzyme complex including specialized pectinases and arabanases. this reduced the costs for the protoplastation step more than 100-fold. however, the most important step in the lysate preparation is the removal of the lytic vacuoles . these contain a great part of undesirable enzymes, including proteases and ribonucleases. lysates prepared without the evacuolation step show nearly no translation activity  <cit> . the vacuoles were removed by centrifugation in a percoll gradient using a modified method based on those described by komoda et al. <cit>  and ishibashi et al. <cit> . due to its low density vacuoles can be separated from the protoplasts yielding high-density evacuolated protoplasts. the continuous percoll layer described in the reports listed above was replaced with a stepwise density gradient, and the protoplasts were applied directly onto the percoll-free top layer. after centrifugation, the evacuolated protoplasts concentrated at the interface between the 40% and 70% percoll layers , whereas the separated vacuoles floated on the top layer. the purity of the evacuolated protoplasts was verified by microscopy . the yield of the evacuolation step was ~65%, estimated using a neubauer counting chamber. the evacuolated protoplasts were washed and then disrupted by nitrogen decompression to protect labile cell components from oxidation  <cit> . after the removal of nuclei and non-disrupted cells, the lysate was incubated with nuclease s <dig> to destroy endogenous mrna and to reduce background translation to a minimum  <cit> . this step leaves the integrity of the 18s and 28s ribosomal rnas mainly unaffected and therefore increases the translation efficiency of exogenous mrna substantially  <cit> .

the evacuolation step is comparable to the endosperm removal step during wge preparation, and is essential because the endosperm contains several translation inhibitors such as tritin and thionin, as well as nucleases and proteases  <cit> . however, the evacuolation step takes ~90 min, whereas endosperm removal requires 2– <dig> d because embryo particles remaining after the grinding and sieving of wheat seeds must be selected manually to eliminate those containing larger amounts of endosperm  <cit> . without the preselection of embryo particles by flotation using toxic organic solvents such as carbon tetrachloride, the selection process would take even longer  <cit> .

the lysis of the evacuolated protoplasts takes ~30 min, which again is much faster than the equivalent process during wge preparation, i.e. the extraction of the wheat embryos which takes 5–7 h  <cit> . furthermore, the nitrogen decompression method for protoplast lysis protects labile components from oxidation, in contrast to the crushing of embryo particles in a mill/mixer or the disruption of protoplasts using a dounce homogenizer as described in the original protocol  <cit> . figure  <dig> compares the timelines for the preparation of byl and wge, showing that the preparation of byl takes 4–5 h compared to 4– <dig> days for the wge. a 3-l by- <dig> cell suspension culture can yield ~30 ml of byl with a final protein concentration of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/ml  <cit> .

in vitro translation activity of byl in batch reactions
the performance of byl compared to commercial wges was investigated by producing the reporter proteins eyfp and luciferase in both systems and measuring fluorescence, which is much faster than standard methods and does not involve radioactive labeling. kahn et al. <cit>  and yukawa et al. <cit>  demonstrated that the fluorescence of gfp produced in cell-free systems was comparable with the radioactivity of 35s methionine incorporated during the translation process, showing that translation yield can be quantified by fluorescence measurement. similarly, a correlation between luciferase activity and the incorporation of 14c leucine has been demonstrated in wge, rll and ece  <cit> .

to maximize protein expression, we optimized the mrna sequence introduced into the byl translation reaction. several mrna structural characteristics affect translation efficiency  <cit>  including the untranslated regions  at the 5’ and 3’ ends of the coding sequence  <cit> . the structure of the 5’ utr influences translational initiation, termination and mrna stability  <cit> . one of the rate-limiting steps in translational initiation is the binding of the mrna to the 43s pre-initiation complex  <cit> . the translational machinery is recruited by the 5’-cap or translational enhancers in the leader sequence  <cit> . to find the optimal utrs for the by- <dig> system, we constructed eight different eyfp expression constructs with various 5’ and 3’ utrs . the 5’ utr in pcite2a contains an internal ribosomal entry site  derived from encephalomyocarditis virus , which is widely used in eukaryotic host cells and cell-free extracts  <cit> . the pf3a vector was designed for use with wheat germ extract and contains sequences from barley yellow dwarf virus   <cit> . the pix <dig>  vector used with ices contains the 5’ utr from a baculovirus polyhedrin gene and a synthetic 3’ utr including a poly sequence. the polyhedrin promoter achieves the highest yields in the ice system  <cit> , but because it is also compatible with the wge and rll systems  <cit>  we assumed it would also be functional in the byl. the 5’ utr in the pivex <dig>  vector includes an arc- <dig> sequence element, which is complementary to an internal 18s rrna segment  <cit>  and may promote binding to the 40s ribosomal subunit  <cit> . this 18s rna region is highly conserved among eukaryotes  <cit> , so we assumed it would be functional in both the byl and wge systems. the tobacco mosaic virus  5’-utr  is a well-known translational enhancer that is included in the vectors pivex_omega_eyfp-his and pivex_gaa_omega_eyfp-his  <cit> . it is functional as an enhancer not only in tobacco plants, but also in the wge, rll and ece cell-free systems  <cit> . the tmv omega sequence was improved by adding gaa upstream of the initial gua triplet  <cit> . the pivex_gaa_e <dig> construct contains a synthetic sequence which was selected by its ability to promote the formation of polysomes in wges  <cit> .

the eyfp expression constructs described above were used as templates to produce capped mrna in vitro in the presence of the cap analog m7gpppg. non-incorporated nucleotides and cap analogs were removed by gel filtration, and 2 μg of the purified mrna was translated in the byl and wge  systems for 18 h. the optimal reaction conditions were defined by monitoring eyfp fluorescence using capped gaa_omega_eyfp-his mrna as a template. the highest eyfp fluorescence was detected in the presence of  <dig>  mm magnesium acetate and 61 mm potassium acetate . because the optimal potassium concentration is dependent on the template, each construct was evaluated in the same manner. the optimum potassium concentration ranged from 61 mm  to 68 mm . the influence of the template concentration was determined using capped gaa_omega_eyfp-his mrna, and saturation was observed at ~40 ng/μl . polyadenylation sequences are known to increase translational efficiency and mrna stability  <cit> . so we exchanged the tmv 3’ utr sequence in pivex <dig> _eyfp-his and gaa_omega_eyfp-his with the equivalent sequence in pix <dig> _his-eyfp, containing a synthetic poly sequence, but this exchange actually reduced the yield of the target protein . similarly, sawasaki et al. <cit>  found that translation in wge does not depend on a specific 3’ utr or a poly sequence, but rather on the length of the 3’ utr.

in the wge system, we used  <dig>  mm magnesium according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the optimal concentrations of potassium and mrna were determined as described for the byl system . the highest fluorescence intensities were achieved at potassium concentrations of 103 mm , 133 mm  and 163 mm . as for the byl system, 40 ng/μl of capped gaa_omega_eyfp-his mrna was sufficient. when the optimal concentrations were used with both systems, byl yielded significantly more eyfp than wge  with all eight constructs . gaa_omega_eyfp-his was the most productive construct in both systems, achieving maximum yields of ~78 ± 9 μg/ml eyfp in the byl system and 44 ± 4 μg/ml eyfp in wge batch reactions, after incubation at 25°c and 500 rpm for 18 h. based on our findings the pcite 5’ utr is deemed unsuitable for both the byl and wge systems, even though it has previously been used for the replication of plant rna viruses in a similar by- <dig> system  <cit> . this may reflect the absence of specific translation factors. as expected, construct pivex <dig> _eyfp-his worked well in both systems, probably due to the strong conservation of the 18s rrna sequence among eukaryotes. the lysate batch variations of four different preparations tested in quadruplicates using capped gaa_omega_eyfp-his mrna as template was ±9% .

we also compared the expression of luciferase genes from firefly  and renilla reniformis  in the byl and wge systems, by exchanging the eyfp sequence in pivex <dig> _eyfp-his for the corresponding luciferase genes . again, we used 2 μg of capped mrna as a template and the reactions were incubated at 25°c and 500 rpm for 18 h. the translation of both the firefly and renilla luciferase rnas was 350% higher than in the wge, corresponding to more than ~100 μg/ml of the target protein . these data showed that the target protein yields were similar with three different model proteins.

in vitro translation activity of byl in dialysis reactions
although the byl system is highly productive, sustainable in vitro protein synthesis can only be achieved in dialysis mode when substrates and energy components are continuously supplied across a semi-permeable membrane. dialysis mode also dilutes potentially inhibitory reaction byproducts, which contributes to the higher protein yields. to evaluate the byl system in dialysis mode, we used rts wheat germ continuous exchange cell-free  devices  and compared the byl system to the two commercial wges from promega and 5prime. the reaction mixtures for the byl and promega wge systems were prepared as described above for batch mode production. the feeding solutions were used in  <dig> fold excess and contained the same components as the reaction mixtures with the exception of lysate, mrna, rnase inhibitor and creatine phosphokinase. the reaction mixture for the 5prime wge system was prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions. we restricted the comparison to those constructs yielding the highest amounts of eyfp in the batch reactions, i.e. constructs 4a, 4b and  <dig> . we used 60 ng/μl of m <dig> ’-ogpppg capped mrna as the template. for all three constructs, the byl system was substantially more productive than the promega wge system , producing 150% more eyfp when tested with the vectors pivex <dig> _eyfp-his and gaa_omega_eyfp-his. surprisingly vector pivex <dig> _his-eyfp was largely inactive in the promega wge system, but worked fine in the byl. the byl system was also more productive than the 5prime wge system, yielding ~130% more eyfp when tested with pivex <dig> _his-eyfp and ~150% more eyfp when tested with pivex <dig> _eyfp-his. the eyfp yield from vector gaa_omega_eyfp-his was comparable in both systems. for construct gaa_omega_eyfp-his in each case 10 μl of the byl and wge translation reactions were analysed by sds-page . notably, eyfp expression in the byl system could be enhanced more than five-fold by switching from batch production to dialysis mode.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the byl is a promising system with high translational activity, short preparation time and high potential for scaling-up. it is likely that the efficiency of the byl system can be improved further, e.g. by optimizing reaction conditions through a factorial design approach  <cit> . the byl system is based on eukaryotic components and should therefore be suitable for the expression of eukaryotic proteins, but further studies are required to determine whether the byl system is capable of carrying out modifications such as glycosylation and the formation of disulfide bonds. a coupled transcription/translation system based on the byl shall also be addressed in further studies.
