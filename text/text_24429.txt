BACKGROUND
the epigenome of a specific tissue constitutes the total set of chromatin modifications existing above the level of dna base sequence and mitotically inherited, conveying stability to the differentiated state. in mammalian cells, these epigenetic modifications consist primarily of dna methylation, histone post-translational modifications and variants, and nucleosome remodeling mechanisms  <cit> . with the increased availability of reagents and techniques for defining epigenetic modifications, numerous studies have been published describing the epigenomes of various cell types. examples of mammalian cells that have been studied include mouse resting b lymphocytes  <cit> , and embryonic erythrocytes and fibroblasts  <cit> .

granulopoiesis, the terminal differentiation of blood granulocytes  occurs within the bone marrow and is well-described  <cit> . in humans the process takes about two weeks, starting from the myeloblast stage , exhibiting one week of differentiation and mitosis, followed by one week of post-mitotic nuclear and cytoplasmic differentiation  <cit> . during the post-mitotic phase the non-dividing nucleus displays progressive chromatin condensation and nuclear shape changes. the normal human neutrophil nucleus has 3– <dig> lobes  <cit> ; mouse neutrophils frequently possess ring-shaped nuclei  <cit> . these modulations of neutrophil nuclear shape and the considerable amount of heterochromatin located adjacent to the nuclear envelope  depend upon normal amounts of the integral ne protein lamin b receptor . without sufficient levels of lbr, the neutrophil nucleus does not exhibit the normal lobulation or ring-shape and the heterochromatin undergoes clumping removed from the ne  <cit> . other factors involved in the differentiation of neutrophil nuclear shape include ne lamin composition and microtubule integrity .

a recent study comparing the nuclear composition of human neutrophils with a variety of myeloid leukemias  <cit>  concluded that normal mature neutrophils exhibit a deficiency of mono-, di- and trimethylated histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> , combined with an absence of heterochromatin protein  <dig>  α, β and γ; whereas myeloid leukemias possessed all of these markers. this observation is somewhat puzzling, since lbr has been shown to interact with hp <dig> proteins  <cit> , and hp <dig> has been suggested to mediate the association between heterochromatin and lbr at the ne  <cit> . furthermore, since methylated h3k <dig> is a well-studied repressive epigenetic modification  <cit>  and trimethylated h3k <dig> is concentrated at pericentric and centric constitutive heterochromatin  <cit> , the apparent absence of methylated h3k <dig> and hp <dig> would imply a unique combination of factors in the epigenome of granulocytes.

in the present investigation, we demonstrate that human and mouse granulocytes do possess methylated h3k <dig> , as well as low amounts of hp <dig> γ. the same spectrum of epigenetic markers  was observed in undifferentiated and granulocytic forms of retinoic acid  treated mouse promyelocytic cells   <cit> , which undergo complete and normal differentiation in vitro  <cit> . therefore, excepting the reduced amounts of hp <dig> proteins, the global epigenome of granulocytes appears to be more consistent with other mammalian cell-types and various myeloid leukemias, than has been previously suggested  <cit> . in the present study, mouse blood and mpro granulocytes revealed clear co-localization of trimethylated h3k <dig>  trimethylated h4k <dig> and hp <dig> γ with pericentric heterochromatin. this observation agrees with earlier observations of co-localizated trimethylated h3k <dig> and trimethylated h4k <dig> in pericentric heterochromatin of various cultured mouse cells  <cit> .

RESULTS
peripheral blood granulocytes possess various types of histone methylation
wright-giemsa stained smears of human or mouse peripheral blood reveal the well-described nuclear morphologies of neutrophilic granulocytes . human neutrophils normally exhibit 3– <dig> lobes; mouse neutrophils frequently show ring-shaped nuclei with numerous ne nodules. in situ hybridization studies have clearly demonstrated that nodules in female human granulocytes  contain the inactive x chromosome  <cit> . however, the situation appears to be somewhat different with mouse granulocytes, since nodules are more frequent than the number of x chromosomes .

slides were prepared from purified human granulocytes for immunostaining with a variety of anti-methylated histone antibodies. some of the results from conventional epifluorescent imaging are presented in figure  <dig>  the purified granulocytes were centrifuged onto polylysine-coated slides, fixed with pfa, permeabilized and immunostained. all of the anti-methylated histone antibodies gave positive staining; but with varying intensities and varying patterns of localization. anti-di- and trimethyl h3k <dig> and anti-mono-, di- and trimethyl h3k <dig> appeared to stain granulocyte nuclei. the pattern of staining by anti-trimethyl h3k <dig> was especially intriguing, yielding several intensely stained spots within each granulocyte nucleus. anti-di- and trimethyl h4k <dig> revealed a mixture of weak nuclear and cytoplasmic staining.

immunoblots were performed on acid extracts of purified human blood granulocytes derived from one normal male and one normal female. a gallery of representative blots, including acid extracted hela cells, is presented in figure  <dig>  similar granulocyte protein loads were employed in all blots; hela protein loads were also unchanged. all of the anti-methylated histone antibodies gave positive staining of varying strengths and with varying intensities relative to the hela extract. an indication of reaction strength was obtained by noting the exposure times of the films. consideration of both immunostaining and immunoblotting data yielded a qualitative assessment of the antibody reactions, and is summarized in table  <dig>  with respect to anti-trimethyl h3k <dig>  it is conceivable that the contrasting results, comparing immunostaining with immunoblotting, reflects high local concentrations within the pericentric heterochromatin, but low total amounts of the protein modification in the nucleus.

*the results listed represent a qualitative assessment, combining data from immunostaining and immunoblotting. in the case of normal mouse blood, due to inadequate enrichment of granulocytes, no immunoblotting was performed.

** identical immunostaining and immunoblotting results were obtained with undifferentiated and ra differentiated mpro cells.

‡ moderate to strong staining in the cytoplasm only.

heparinized whole mouse blood, diluted with dmem medium was centrifuged onto polylysine-coated slides, fixed with pfa, permeabilized and immunostained. granulocytes were stained with a variety of anti-methylated histone antibodies and imaged by conventional epifluorescent microscopy . varying levels of reactivity with all the antibodies was noted . of particular interest was the clear co-localization of anti-trimethylated h3k <dig> and trimethylated h4k <dig> with dapi-bright pericentric heterochromatin, consistent with earlier observations on mouse cells  <cit> . confocal images of mouse blood granulocytes doubly stained for lamin b and anti-trimethylated h3k <dig> or trimethylated h4k <dig>  demonstrate that ne nodules appear to contain these pericentric heterochromatin markers. no immunoblots were performed on mouse granulocytes, since we were unable to obtain purified fractions suitable for extraction.

mpro granulocytes possess various types of histone methylation
the same panel of methylation-specific anti-histone antibodies was tested on undifferentiated and ra-differentiated mpro cells by immunofluorescent and immunoblotting techniques. figure  <dig> presents the results of immunostaining, with comparative staining by anti-lamin b and dapi. as with mouse blood granulocytes , mpro granulocytes  were strongly stained by anti-trimethyl h3k <dig> and anti-trimethyl h4k <dig> in bright spots that co-localized to dapi-bright pericentric regions. more generalized nuclear staining was obtained with anti-dimethyl h3k <dig>  anti-mono-, di- and trimethyl h3k <dig> and, less intensely, with anti-dimethyl h4k <dig> 

immunoblotting experiments on acid extracts of mpro cells  are presented in figure  <dig>  as with the previous immunoblotting data on extracts of human granulocytes , the same protein loads were used in all gels and the reaction intensities shown are from different exposure times. the qualitative assessment of antibody reactivity, combining immunostaining and immunoblotting data is presented in table  <dig>  no systematic changes in reaction intensities were observed comparing undifferentiated with ra-treated granulocytic mpro cell extracts. also, as described for human granulocyte extracts, anti-trimethyl h3k <dig> displayed very weak immunoblotting reactivity. again we suggest that the low cellular level of trimethyl h3k <dig> may yield strong immunostaining because of a high local concentration in the pericentric heterochromatin.

peripheral blood granulocytes are deficient in hp <dig> proteins
because of difficulties that we have experienced employing commercial anti-hp <dig> antibodies to immunostain blood granulocytes, we decided to test the antibodies on mouse nih 3t <dig> cells, where numerous authors have demonstrated localization of anti-hp <dig> on dapi-bright interphase pericentric heterochromatin  <cit> . results with our best antibodies for immunostaining  of nih 3t <dig> cells are presented in figure  <dig>  our images closely resemble previously published data  <cit> , indicating a co-localization of hp <dig> α and γ on pericentric heterochromatin.

examples of hp <dig> α, β and γ immunostained human "buffy coat" preparations are presented in figure  <dig>   granulocytes of the buffy coat showed no nuclear staining by anti-hp <dig> α and β and only weak staining with anti-hp <dig> γ. anti-hp <dig> α and β appeared to yield a weak reaction with granulocyte cytoplasmic granules, which was also seen using anti-hp <dig> γ. these granular structures do not derive from the secondary antibody . mononuclear cells  of the buffy coat provided an internal positive control for nuclear staining by anti-hp <dig> antibodies.

immunoblotting experiments with whole cell extracts of human granulocytes  generally agreed with the immunostaining experiments; i.e., no clear evidence of hp <dig> α or β, an indication of trace amounts of hp <dig> γ. different sources of anti-hp <dig> β indicated the possibility of a lower molecular weight cross-reacting antigen , which was not studied further.

immunostaining experiments with anti-hp <dig> antibodies were performed on buffy coat preparations from whole mouse blood . results clearly indicated negligible staining by anti-hp <dig> α or β of mouse granulocytes, with clear nuclear staining of blood monocytic nuclei. however, anti-hp <dig> γ yielded granulocyte nuclear staining, somewhat brighter in pericentric heterochromatin; monocytic nuclei were also stained.

in summary , we conclude that peripheral blood granulocytes possess negligible amounts of hp <dig> α or β, and low levels of hp <dig> γ. on the other hand, blood mononuclear cells do clearly stain for all hp <dig> isoforms.

mpro granulocytes possess hp <dig> proteins
immunostaining experiments were performed on undifferentiated and granulocytic mpro cells . the most convincing nuclear staining was with anti-hp <dig> γ, which yielded a combination of diffuse nuclear staining and focal staining, which co-localizes with dapi-bright pericentric heterochromatin  and anti-trimethyl h4k <dig> . both anti-hp <dig> α and β yielded weak staining in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. immunoblotting experiments were conducted upon extracts of undifferentiated and ra-treated  granulocytic mpro cells . an extract of hela cells was included as a control. convincing reactions with mpro extracts were observed with anti-hp <dig> β and γ.  mpro hp <dig> β appears to possess a larger molecular weight than measured in hela extracts  and does not appear to decrease during the differentiation process. the apparent molecular weight of hela and mpro hp <dig> γ, as determined on 12% acrylamide sds gels, was ~23– <dig> kd. since the protein loads for the mpro lanes was approximately the same , the declining reactivity comparing o and ra, suggests that the cellular level of hp1γ decreases during the granulocytic differentiation process. in summary, immunostaining and immunoblotting studies support the presence of hp <dig> γ in mpro granulocyte nuclei, with weaker evidence pertaining to hp <dig> α and β .

discussion
blood neutrophilic granulocytes are regarded as terminally differentiated cells which are destined to undergo apoptosis, but can be activated into a short-lived migratory phagocytotic form by the presence of bacterial or yeast infections  <cit> . mature neutrophils possess considerable quantities of heterochromatin  <cit> , suggesting transcriptional repression. however, recent studies have clearly demonstrated that neutrophil activation by bacteria or bacterial lipopolysaccharide results in rapid and extensive changes in gene expression  <cit> . our laboratory has focused upon the cellular mechanisms of nuclear shape change and heterochromatin distribution occurring during granulopoiesis  <cit> .

the cellular mechanisms producing progressive chromatin condensation during granulopoiesis are not understood. it seems reasonable to assume that described features of constitutive and facultative heterochromatin  <cit>  apply to the situation of condensing granulocyte chromatin. some of these features include: 1) hypoacetylation of histone lysines; 2) methylation of specific histone lysine residues ; 3) dna methylation; 4) chromatin binding by repressive proteins, such as hp <dig> α, β and γ. our present analysis of granulocyte nuclei only focuses upon two global epigenetic features, repressive histone methylation and hp <dig> 

repressive epigenetic features: histone methylation and hp1
only one published study  <cit>  has examined global epigenetic features of granulocyte heterochromatin. this study concluded that normal human neutrophils are deficient in methylated h3k <dig> and hp <dig> α, β and γ. based upon our present study, we agree that there is a paucity of hp <dig> α and β in normal human and mouse neutrophils, but we can detect low amounts of nuclear hp <dig> γ. futhermore, undifferentiated and granulocytic forms of mpro  cells reveal detectable levels of hp <dig> α, β and γ. it might be argued that mpro granulocytes are not normal differentiated cells, but resemble leukemic cells, which do contain all isoforms of hp <dig>  <cit> . however, mpro cells are not derived from leukemic mice and the in vitro granulocytic differentiation induced by ra is believed to yield mature granulocytes  <cit> , with a gene expression pattern closely mimicking normal granulopoiesis  <cit> .

a possible explanation for the apparent absence of hp <dig> α and β in normal human neutrophils is degradation during granulocyte preparation and extraction for immunoblotting. proteolysis is a definite problem when working with granulocyte preparations, even in the presence of high quantities of protease inhibitors . whatever the reasons, our evidence indicated that low levels of hp <dig> γ are detectable in normal granulocytes. the evident paucity of hp <dig> in the nuclei of mature neutrophils suggests that models postulating an essential role for hp <dig> in the establishment of heterochromatin and its adherence to the ne  <cit>  may not be applicable to these cell-types. on this issue, we are in complete agreement with the earlier published discussion  <cit> . we cannot rule out the possibility that hp <dig> proteins present early during granulopoiesis fulfil a role in the establishment of heterochromatin, which subsequently might be maintained by low amounts of hp <dig> γ in the mature granulocytes.

the major disagreement between our study and the previous publication  <cit>  concerns the existence of various isoforms of methylated h3k <dig>  we describe immunofluorescent and immunoblotting data supporting the presence of repressive methylated h3k <dig>  h3k <dig> and h4k <dig> in normal human and mouse granulocytes and mpro undifferentiated and granulocytic forms. the most dramatic images were obtained with trimethyl h3k <dig> and trimethyl h4k <dig> immunostained mouse blood and mpro granulocytes. in these situations, clear co-localization with dapi-bright pericentric heterochromatin was demonstrated. anti-trimethyl h3k <dig> yielded similar intensely stained spots within human granulocyte nuclei. but the pattern of dapi staining in human granulocytes is quite different than observed in mouse granulocyte nuclei . in human granulocyte nuclei, the dapi-stained heterochromatin forms a thick layer under the nuclear envelope and central masses within the nuclear lobes. several of the methylated histone antibodies  appeared to generally stain human granulocyte heterochromatin.

formation of heterochromatin in the apparent absence of hp <dig> has been reported previously  <cit> . nucleated chicken erythrocytes possess negligible amounts of hp <dig> α, β and γ, reduced trimethyl h3k <dig> and very low amounts of trimethyl h3k <dig>  however, reasonable levels of dimethyl h3k <dig> were observed. in the same study, the authors demonstrated significant levels of hp <dig> α, β and γ and trimethyl h3k <dig>  but reduced trimethyl h3k <dig> in mouse embryonic erythrocyte nuclei. more recently, in a study of resting mouse lymphocytes  <cit> , the authors describe low levels of hp <dig> β, mono-, di- and trimethylated h3k <dig>  trimethylated h3k <dig> and di- and trimethylated h4k <dig>  activation of the lymphocytes resulted in increases in the levels of all these epigenetic marks. in a variety of mouse tissue culture cells, co-localization of trimethyl h3k <dig> and trimethyl h4k <dig> on pericentric heterochromatin has been clearly demonstrated  <cit> . a model for sequential trimethylation of h3k <dig> and h4k <dig> on pericentric heterochromatin was presented  <cit> , involving a stabilizing role for hp <dig> α and β binding to trimethyl h3k <dig> and recruiting suv4-20h to trimethylate h4k <dig>  it remains to be demonstrated whether hp <dig> γ could also serve as the postulated intermediary, in the absence of hp <dig> α and β.

histone variants and dna methylation
an additional epigenetic feature of granulocyte nuclei, described by us in an earlier publication  <cit> , pertains to histone h <dig> subtypes and phosphorylation. in a comparison of human neutrophils to leukemic hl- <dig> cells, we concluded that granulocytic differentiation results in dephosphorylation of subtypes h <dig> , h <dig>  and h <dig> . furthermore, subtype h <dig>  was observed in acid extracts of normal human granulocytes, but not in those of undifferentiated or ra differentiated hl- <dig> cells.

there is virtually no published information on the possible role of global dna methylation in the establishment of granulocyte heterochromatin. given what is known from other cell types concerning cpg methylation of pericentric heterochromatin  <cit> , it seems reasonable to assume a similar role for dna methylation in granulocytic cells. however, studies on the patterns and inhibition of dna methylation during granulocytic differentiation of hl- <dig> cells suggest that methylation is not essential  <cit> .

neutrophil nuclear deformability
the present experiments, combined with earlier observations, provide a basis for understanding the mechanism of granulocyte nuclear drumstick or nodule formation observed in human or mouse blood smears. it appears that nodules often contain pericentric heterochromatin  or the inactive x chromosome . we have previously suggested that the ne of granulocytes is highly deformable due to low levels of lamins a and b <dig>  <cit> . this view is based upon observations on hl- <dig> cells  <cit>  and earlier studies of mouse granulocytes  <cit> . absence of lamin a in the ne has been shown to increase ne deformability in mechanical strain tests  <cit> , consistent with conclusions from laminopathies  <cit> . there is now clear and convincing evidence that the composition and integrity of the lamin polymer strongly influences the ne strength  <cit> . our view is that drumsticks and nodules are artifacts of the flattening of granulocyte nuclei, reflecting the more rigid heterochromatic foci pushing against a deformable ne.

it seems reasonable to speculate that the altered composition of the granulocyte ne  is an essential part of the mechanism of nuclear lobulation  <cit>  or formation of ring-shaped nuclei  <cit> . both the increased deformability of the ne and nuclear lobulation  may facilitate migration of activated neutrophils through blood vessel endothelia and tight tissue spaces towards a site of infection. the importance of granulocyte nuclear lobulation for chemotactic migration through narrow pores and tight spaces was demonstrated in a study of individuals with pelger huet anomaly  <cit> . we have shown ne deficiency of lbr in human pelger huet anomaly  <cit>  and mouse ichthyosis  <cit> , resulting in granulocyte nuclear hypolobulation. one additional functional consequence of increased granulocyte ne deformability may be to facilitate the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps   <cit> . these structures appear to be an extruded complex of chromatin and elastase that traps and degrades invading bacteria.

CONCLUSIONS
mature blood neutrophils possess considerable heterochromatin containing a variety of repressive histone methylation markers: di- and trimethylated h3k9; mono-, di- and trimethyl h3k27; di- and trimethyl h4k20). in addition, normal neutrophils exhibit negligible amounts of hp <dig> α and β, but reveal detectable levels of hp <dig> γ. clear co-localization of trimethylated h3k <dig>  trimethylated h4k <dig> and hp <dig> γ on pericentric heterochromatin was demonstrated in normal mouse blood neutrophils and granulocytic forms of mouse mpro cells.
