BACKGROUND
the sanger dna sequencing technique has been and still is the method of choice for de novo sequencing of complete genomes  <cit> . however, whole genome sequencing using the sanger method is relatively expensive, labor intensive, and time consuming.

several methods for ultra high-throughput dna sequencing that reduce the cost and labor demands of sanger sequencing are currently available  <cit> . the illumina  <dig> g genome analyzer  uses a sequencing by synthesis method, during which millions of dna fragments are sequenced in parallel . with this method, costly and often problematic procedures, such as cloning are eliminated. another advantage is that accuracy is independent of sequence context because a discrete signal is generated per each base. thus, this method is very accurate in cases of homopolymeric sequences and generates quality values that are analogous to phred scores  <cit> . sequence lengths generally range from 25– <dig> bp , which is sufficient for unique alignment to a reference genome  <cit> . because millions of fragments are sequenced in parallel, a fragment can be sequenced even if it exists in low abundance in the sample, thereby increasing sequencing depth and enabling identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms  with high accuracy  <cit> .

sequencing of reduced representation libraries , which are reproducible subsets of the genome, allows cost-effective genome-wide snp discovery with accurate estimations of minor allele frequencies   <cit> . because the cost of large-scale sequencing of rrls is still prohibitive for individual samples, dna samples can be pooled to further reduce sequencing costs and simultaneously infer the frequencies of two snp alleles with high accuracy  <cit> . previous studies have shown that large-scale snp discovery can be accurate using massive parallel sequences of rrls prepared from pooled dna  <cit> .

despite the efficiency of massive parallel sequencing for providing large amounts of sequencing data, a sequence selection stage is still required. previous studies have applied various rules for sequence selection: sequences must start with a restriction motif  <cit> , sequences must be aligned to a unique location in the genome  <cit> , and sequences must have a minimum average sequence quality  score of  <dig>  <cit> . an effective sequence selection stage can decrease noise in the data that can compromise alignment and snp identification. therefore, the effect of different levels of sq in identifying snps needs to be evaluated.

with increasing attention being paid to genomic selection by animal breeders, there is a need for high-density snp maps of the genomes of farm animals. experimental evidence has shown that linkage disequilibrium extends from  <dig>  to  <dig> cm in european commercial pig breeds  <cit> ; thus, an snp assay should contain a minimum of  <dig> k informative snps. to achieve this goal, we designed a cost-effective strategy for large scale identification of snps in the porcine genome that could be applied to other species.

in this study, an rrl generated from a dna pool of a boar line was sequenced using the illumina  <dig> g genome analyzer. the two main goals of our study were  to develop rules for decreasing sequence ambiguity , which would decrease noise and increase efficiency in sequence alignment and snp identification, and  to evaluate the effects of different sq filtering strategies for cost-effective, large-scale identification of snps.

RESULTS
sequencing and filtering the rrl
an rrl was produced from a dna pool of five boars from a crossbred  commercial boar line , using the restriction enzyme drai, which recognizes pattern "tttaaa" and generates blunt-ended fragments starting with aaa. fragments 150–250-bp long were selected and end-sequenced using the illumina  <dig> g genome analyzer. short sequences will align to a unique genomic location , creating groups  with a number of sequences  sufficient for snp identification. the in silico digest of pre-ensembl sus scrofa build  <dig>  <cit>  indicated an expected sequence coverage of ~1% of the reference genome, that is,  <dig> , <dig> bp uniquely aligned to the porcine genome.

in total,  <dig> , <dig> sequences were generated during three different runs. in addition to sequence information, this second generation platform generates quality scores that are analogous to phred scores   <cit> . levels of base quality varied between runs and along the sequence length, and decreased considerably at the 3'end . this variation in base quality along the sequence has been reported in previous studies using short sequencing  <cit> . base quality for the first three bases is poor, but increases before decreasing again at the end of the 31-bp sequence. poor base quality at the first three bases is due to the properties of the algorithm implemented in the illumina base caller bustard® . the quality score of a base is calculated by comparing the fluorescence signals of the previous and following bases. the algorithm does not expect a repeated motif in the beginning of a sequence  and therefore estimates poor quality scores. the severe decrease in base quality at the 3' end of the sequence indicates the existence of a higher level of sequencing errors at the 3' end. the proportion of unique sequences  ranged from 35% when considering a sequence length of  <dig> bp to 55% when considering a sequence length of  <dig> bp, which again indicates an increase in sequencing errors with an increase in sequence length. therefore, sequences were trimmed at  <dig> bp and filtering rules were applied.

we applied a number of rules to select sequences for further analysis:  screening for properties of the rrl ;  filtering for sequence ambiguity, and  filtering for sq. filtering for sequence ambiguity was performed by removing sequences with homopolymers and removing sequences with a high rate of re-sampling. sequences with a re-sampling rate above an expected level were discarded as potentially paralogous sequences. because pre-ensembl sus scrofa build  <dig>  <cit>  comprises approximately 70% of the porcine genome, unique alignment of reads does not guarantee that there is no other similar  sequence in the remainder of the genome. therefore, potential paralogous sequences should be eliminated from the data set to avoid identification of false-positive snps. this was done by estimating the ratio between the total number of fragments obtained after filtering for the restriction motif, unknown bases, homopolymers, and the numbers of fragments generated from an in silico digest. this ratio, the estimated average level of sequence re-sampling, was estimated at 35×, and sequences with a frequency approximately 3-fold greater  were removed.

the illumina  <dig> g genome analyzer® produces quality scores analogous to phred scores. sq has been defined in previous studies as the average of the quality scores of all bases in a sequence, and the threshold has been set to a minimum of sq =  <dig>  <cit> , which implies that on average,  <dig> in  <dig> bases is wrongly identified. applying this strict filtering rule left sufficient target coverage for snp identification. in this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of different thresholds of sq on the identification of true snps. sq was also evaluated by calculating the average of the base quality scores for all the bases of a given sequence. three data sets with different sq levels  were generated and compared for snp identification. these three different data sets are hereafter referred to as data  <dig> for a quality level of  <dig>  data  <dig> for a quality level of  <dig>  and data  <dig> for a quality level of  <dig>  the total number of sequences that remained after applying all of the filtering rules and that were used for alignment with the reference genome for data  <dig>  data <dig>  and data  <dig> are shown in table  <dig>

comparison of strategies for snp identification
sequence mapping was performed using an algorithm that calculates the probability that a sequence maps to a specific target in the genome  <cit> . filtered sequences of data <dig>  data <dig>  and data  <dig> were mapped to pre-ensembl sus scrofa build  <dig>  <cit> . mapping quality  was very similar between the three strategies . this value indicates an error in the mapping procedure of approximately 1/ <dig> sequences  <cit> . after mapping, consensus sequences were generated and snps were extracted, creating a large set of potential snps. at this stage, the algorithm identified  <dig> , <dig> potential snps in data  <dig>   <dig> , <dig> potential snps in data  <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig> potential snps in data  <dig>  four filters were then applied to decrease the rate of false-positive snps: 1) snps were only accepted if they were identified in targets to which only non-ambiguous sequences were assigned; 2) the maximum mapping quality  of the target was larger than or equal to 40; 3) the minimum mapping quality  of a target should be  <dig> or greater, and 4) the consensus quality , which measures the probability of the existence of a polymorphism, was  <dig> or greater . figure  <dig> shows the relationship between target coverage and mapping quality. the smooth line shows a decrease after target coverage exceeds  <dig> sequences. this indicates that clusters with a level of target coverage above the expected number calculated from the in silico analysis have a lower mapping quality and are less reliable for snp identification. additional filters were used to further decrease the rate of false-positive snps: 1) occurrence of the minor allele in a minimum of three sequences , and 2) a maximum target coverage of  <dig> reads. again, the restriction of maximum target coverage aims to decrease the rate of false-positive snps identified in potential paralogous regions that align to each other because the available assembly only comprises around 70% of the total pig genome. the results allowed us to identify a larger number of snps in data  <dig>  with a higher level of cq, lower target coverage, and similar maf values as compared to data  <dig> and data  <dig> 

although a larger set of sequences was used in data  <dig>  resulting in a higher number of potential snps, the actual number of true snps was lower due to the removal of more false positives in the final round of filtering. this indicates that a large number of sequences from this data set were mapped ambiguously, introducing noise into the analysis, and shows that the application of filters for snp selection is crucial for decreasing the rate of false positives. because the dna pool contained  <dig> genomes and the threshold for the minor allele count was three sequences, the observed mafs are greater than  <dig>  for all strategies analyzed  and quite adequate for the use of these snps in whole genome association and genomic selection studies. for a higher level of sq , more snps with mafs between  <dig>  and  <dig>  were identified. this indicates that in snp discovery studies aimed at identifying rare snps, greater sequence depth and higher levels of sq are advisable. a large number of the snps identified using data  <dig> were also identified using data  <dig> and data  <dig>  as a result of the cq threshold used in the analysis . our results indicate that in cases of lower target coverage, lowering the sq threshold may increase the snp discovery rate while keeping the rate of false-positive snps low.

the decrease in quality at the 3' end of the sequences affected the number of snps found per position in the sequence reads. figure  <dig> shows that the number of snps identified decreased from the 5' to the 3' end, indicating that with the strict rules for snp selection used in our study, base errors in the 3' end were not incorrectly identified as snps.

rrl sequence coverage along the pig genome
the reference genome was digested in silico and the predicted coverage compared to that of the aligned consensus sequences is shown in table  <dig>  the consensus sequences aligned evenly to all chromosomes, indicating that the obtained rrl represents a good random sample of the genome. table  <dig> also shows that for all chromosomes, the total sequence length that uniquely aligned to the reference genome was somewhat greater than the value expected from the in silico digest, most obviously for ssc <dig>  this could have resulted from inadequate resolution of dna fragments during electrophoresis, leading to selection of fragments larger than 150– <dig> bp and resulting in  <dig> , <dig> bps of aligned sequences, significantly more than the  <dig> , <dig> bps expected from the in silico digest of the genome assembly  <cit> .

sequence polymorphism in the pig genome
nucleotide diversity  <cit>  across all chromosomes was evaluated in 1-mb windows based on the pre-ensembl sus scrofa build  <dig>  <cit> . this analysis showed that ssc  <dig>  ssc <dig>  and ssc <dig> have relatively greater nucleotide diversity, whereas ssc <dig> and sscx have relatively lower nucleotide diversity . figure  <dig> illustrates the variation in nucleotide diversity and the length of sequence coverage for ssc <dig>  regions towards the telomeres have greater levels of nucleotide diversity and regions close to the centromere have the lowest levels of nucleotide diversity. the results for window  <dig>  shown in figure  <dig>  also indicate that in windows of lower sequence coverage, nucleotide diversity may be overestimated. for some chromosomes , a correlation was observed between the level of gc content and nucleotide diversity, suggesting a relationship between gc content and polymorphism patterns for specific chromosomal regions. previous studies have shown a relationship between gc content and polymorphism patterns in humans. such gc-rich regions have been identified as regions of gene conversion and recombination hot spots  <cit> . our results suggest that such relationships exist in many porcine chromosomes.

although this study covered only ~1% of the porcine genome, using an rrl allowed estimation of genome-wide nucleotide diversity. variation in nucleotide diversity and length of sequence coverage for the remaining chromosomes are shown in . the pattern of variation in nucleotide diversity along chromosomes varies between chromosomes; ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  and sscx have higher levels of nucleotide diversity towards the telomeric regions and lower levels of nucleotide diversity in the centromeric region. on sscx, large areas flanking the centromere were devoid of nucleotide diversity. reduced variability in the x chromosome relative to the autosomes has been described for other species, including humans  <cit> , drosophila  <cit> , and mice  <cit> , and is explained mainly by the fact that this chromosome has a lower mutation rate and a smaller effective population size  <cit> .

snp genotyping and validation
a snp chip assay was conducted to validate a sample of  <dig>  snps in the original snp discovery panel. of the  <dig>  snps, 3% failed as a result of the assay design. the validation assay included  <dig> assayable snps exclusively found in data  <dig>   <dig> assayable snps exclusively shared between data  <dig> and data  <dig>   <dig> assayable snps exclusively found in data  <dig>  and  <dig>  assayable snps shared between data  <dig>  data  <dig>  and data  <dig>  the correlation between the estimated maf  and the genotyped maf in the animals used in the discovery panel was calculated for the  <dig>  snps shared between data  <dig>  data  <dig>  and data  <dig>  the observed correlation of  <dig>  was somewhat lower than that reported by wiedmann  <cit> . in order to investigate this result, maf obtained from short sequence data and from genotyping were simulated and correlations were calculated. results from simulations showed that the correlation between maf estimated from short sequences and maf estimated from genotype data can range from  <dig>  to  <dig> . of the total number of snps tested, 4% appeared to be monomorphic and 85% had an maf above  <dig> , showing that our strategy yielded a high proportion of informative snps useful for whole genome association assays. the fact that the correlation between estimated and observed mafs was not high could restrict the type of measures used to evaluate genomic variation in population genomics studies using short sequences. for example, estimation of pairwise nucleotide diversity  requires accurate estimates of maf, and a correlation of  <dig>  shows that the π estimated from short sequences can be biased.

CONCLUSIONS
we presented a strategy for using short sequences derived from second generation sequencing technology to efficiently identify large numbers of snps with maf estimates at a low false discovery rate. these results show that by lowering the sq it is possible to identify snps while still keeping the false discovery rate low, although the cost is a lower correlation between the estimated and true mafs. finally, our data show that nucleotide diversity is quite variable among porcine chromosomes and is particularly low on sscx.
