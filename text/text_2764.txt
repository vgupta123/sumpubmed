BACKGROUND
jasmonates, including jasmonic acid  and the biologically active intermediates and derivatives of the ja biosynthetic pathway, are powerful regulators of plant development and inducible resistance. by mediating signal transduction they influence changes in expression profiles of a wide range of genes involved in plant defence  <cit> . induction of ja-related response has often been linked to tissue damage, and the important roles of ja signalling in defence against bacterial and fungal infections or caterpillar attack are well documented . more recent research, however, provides evidence for the activation of ja-mediated defence upon attack by phloem-sucking insects, such as aphids and silverleaf whitefly nymphs, which try to avoid tissue damage during feeding  <cit> . phloem feeders possess stylet-like mouthparts, which they use to ingest phloem sap. during penetration of plant tissue the stylet is manoeuvred through plant tissue until it is finally anchored in a sieve tube element. here it can stay for several hours or even days, facilitating a continuous sap supply. by avoiding extensive tissue wounding, aphids minimize the risk of inducing defence responses in the attacked plant while depriving it of assimilates. in the case of a massive infestation, the loss of nutrients interferes with plant growth and development, and may eventually lead to plant death. constitutive or transient activation of ja-related responses is known to enhance a plant's resistance to phloem feeders, including aphids  <cit> .

ja is biosynthesized from polyunsaturated fatty acids released from chloroplast membranes via a series of enzymatic reactions usually referred to as the octadecanoid pathway. in pathogen-free laboratory conditions, a non-functional ja pathway does not result in any disturbance in normal vegetative growth. in a more natural environment, however, mutant plants that do not synthesize ja are more susceptible to pathogen attack because they fail to activate ja-dependent defences  <cit> . a knock-out mutation of the allene oxide synthase  gene, whose product is an enzyme essential for the synthesis of 12-oxophytodienoic acid , a precursor for the synthesis of ja, results in a phenotype unable to produce ja or any ja derivatives  <cit>  . ataos is a single-copy gene, and no alternative enzymes possessing the same catalytic activity have been found in arabidopsis  <cit> . thus, the induction of ja-dependent genes is impaired in the aos mutant  <cit> .

the fatty acid oxygenation up-regulated  <dig>  mutant was isolated by bonaventure and co-workers in a search for plants with increased activity of two key ja biosynthetic enzymes: lipoxygenase  and aos. ja and opda levels are almost doubled in non-challenged fou <dig> plants compared to wt  <cit>  . the fou <dig> allele carries a missense mutation resulting in an amino acid substitution in the two pore channel  <dig>  protein   <cit> . tpc <dig> forms a non-specific, slowly activating, ca2+-regulated cation channel in vacuolar membranes  <cit> . in fou <dig> the tpc <dig> channel has different electrophysiological properties: lower voltage is required for its activation and its time-dependent conductivity is higher than in wt  <cit> . probably due to the increased sensitivity of voltage sensors in the mutated tpc <dig>  the activation of the ja biosynthetic pathway upon wounding is stronger in fou <dig> plants and the levels of free ja and opda are higher in the mutant relative to wt  <cit> .

transcriptional analyses of aphid-infested arabidopsis plants have revealed substantial changes in the expression profiles of many defence-related genes  <cit> . several genes whose products are involved in ja synthesis or ja-dependent signalling have been reported to be up-regulated, indicating that ja-derived compounds play a role in the regulation of expressional changes. as a result of transcriptional reprogramming, the production of proteins involved in defence is promoted  <cit>  and the metabolite profiles of plants are changed  <cit> . despite significant progress in our understanding of plant responses triggered by phloem feeders attack , it is largely unknown how much the induction of these defences relies on ja signalling.

in this study, we provide new insights into the role of jasmonates in the regulation of defence responses upon aphid attack. a specialized phloem feeder is represented by the cabbage aphid, brevicoryne brassicae, for which a model of arabidopsis-aphid interactions has been well established  <cit> . our aim is to identify the genes whose expressional changes are controlled by ja signalling. the subsequent parts of this work concentrate on the following problems: which genes are primarily dependent on jasmonates for their expression? how is the aphid-induced plant defence affected by the absence of ja or the constitutive up-regulation of the ja pathway? how does the impact of the aos and fou <dig> mutations affect aphid performance? to address these problems we have performed transcriptional profiling of both aphid-challenged and non-challenged wild type plants as well as aos and fou <dig> mutants using full genome oligonucleotide microarrays. further, insect fitness experiments and electrical penetration graph analysis have been undertaken to determine how the ja status of the host plants influences the survival and behaviour of insects.

RESULTS
to investigate the importance of ja signalling in transcriptional reprogramming of a. thaliana triggered by aphid attack, we designed an experiment that included comparisons of genome-wide transcription profiles at three levels . each level was comprised of a series of microarray hybridizations exploring transcriptional changes in at least three biological replicates per comparison. at the first level, which we regard as the basic comparison, we aimed to identify and classify genes that are dependent on jasmonates for their basic expression. this was done by comparing the transcription profiles of non-challenged wt plants and the two mutants, aos and fou <dig>  at the second level the changes in transcriptional activity resulting from  <dig> h of aphid infestation of wt, aos and fou <dig> plants were analysed in each of the three lines independently. at the third level we directly compared aphid-induced transcriptional changes in each of the mutants with the corresponding changes in wt plants. the microarray data generated at all three levels were used in the statistical analysis. twelve genes that were particularly interesting due to their involvement in ja signalling and/or their association with plant defence responses were further selected for qrt-pcr analysis. the gene expression profiles revealed by qrt-pcr analysis seem to correspond well to the profiles obtained from microarray data .

identification of genes regulated by the ja signalling pathway
both aos and fou <dig> mutations have a great impact on the regulation of the ja biosythesis pathway regardless of environmental conditions . therefore, before investigation of genes whose transcriptional regulation in response to b. brassicae attack is controlled by ja signalling, we aimed to identify the genes whose basic expression in non-challenged plants is modified according to endogenous ja levels. the following criteria have been adopted to identify jasmonate-dependent genes. to be considered positively regulated by jasmonates, a gene had to be down-regulated in aos  and up-regulated in fou <dig>  as compared to wt. conversely, the expression of genes classified as negatively regulated by jasmonates was positively affected in aos and negatively affected in fou <dig>  respectively. one-hundred seventy-two genes were found to be positively regulated by jasmonates and have been classified into the following functional gene classes: transcripts involved in ja synthesis and ja signalling, defence-related proteins including myrosinases and myrosinase binding or associated proteins, genes whose products are involved in the regulation of transcription, redox balance, cell wall modification, protein modification, nucleoside/nucleotide metabolism, transport and lipid metabolism . among the  <dig> genes whose expression was negatively regulated by jasmonates were several transcription regulators, genes coding for proteins with ankyrin repeats and connected to redox status. except for genes with unknown functions, other categories were represented by only 1- <dig> members .

as ja signalling is important in the regulation of plant defensive responses triggered by aphid attack we expected to observe the effect of the changed ja status on the expression of aphid-responsive genes. it should be noted that not all genes classified by us as ja dependent were found to be responsive to b. brassicae attack. although a number of ja-dependent genes were induced by b. brassicae in wt plants, their aphid-mediated induction was impaired not only in aos, as expected, but also in fou <dig> plants. this was the case for several transcripts whose products are involved either in the biosynthesis of ja or in ja-mediated signalling , defence-related genes, transcription factors and redox homeostasis. table  <dig> summarizes expression profiles of all genes that have been classified by us as ja dependent and whose responsiveness to b. brassicae attack was changed in aos or fou <dig> mutants relative to wt.

the values in the table represent log <dig> transformed gene expression changes for the following comparisons: aos/wt, change in a gene expression level in aos mutant in comparison to wt; fou2/wt, change in a gene expression level in fou <dig> mutant in comparison to wt; wtb/wt, change in a gene expression level in wt plants attacked by aphids in comparison to aphid-free wt controls; aosb/aos, change in a gene expression level in aos plants attacked by aphids in comparison to aphid-free aos controls; fou2b/fou <dig>  change in a gene expression level in fou <dig> plants attacked by aphids in comparison to aphid-free fou <dig> controls; ns, not statistically significantly regulated.

ja signalling has an overall significant impact on the regulation of arabidopsis thaliana responses to brevicoryne brassicae attack
among all aphid responsive genes that have been classified as ja dependent in non-infested plants, the majority were found to have altered responsiveness to b. brassicae attack in the mutants compared to wt . however, several other genes that did not change expression in non-challenged aos and fou <dig> displayed unique responses to aphid infestation in the mutant plants. a list of genes responding differently to b. brassicae attack in a given mutant was created based on the following criteria:  the aphid-induced regulation of a given gene had to be statistically significant for at least one of the two compared genotypes ;  the difference in the aphid-induced gene regulation  between the two compared genotypes had to be larger than one. the complete lists of genes fulfilling these requirements are presented in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> tables s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> while figure  <dig> represents the distribution of functional categories among the differentially responding genes in the two mutants. although, as expected, the aphid-induced responsiveness of many genes was changed in the mutants relative to wt, the direction of the observed changes was surprisingly similar in the aos and fou <dig> mutants. for example, the relatively large groups of genes related to defence and regulation of transcription were less responsive to infestation both in aos and fou <dig> . similarly, among genes identified as more responsive to aphids in the mutants than in wt, transcripts connected to transport, cell wall modification, cell division and development and cytoskeleton organisation were more induced in both mutants . to evaluate an overall impact of the aos and fou <dig> mutations on the different functional gene categories of aphid-responsive genes, go term enrichment analysis was performed with the use of amigo term enrichment software  <cit> . four sets of genes that responded differentially to b. brassicae infestation  were annotated with gene ontology terms and amigo was used to determine whether the observed levels of annotation for the particular sets were significant in the context of a background set . the statistically significantly overrepresented go terms connected to biological process and molecular function nodes were then visualized according to significance level and the numbers of genes attributed to linked go terms were given separately for aos and fou <dig> mutants .

b. brassicae induced regulation of transcription factors and defence-related genes is largely controlled by ja signalling
the ja signalling pathway is believed to significantly contribute to the regulation of defence-connected genes under stress conditions. the go terms denoted "transcription regulation activity" and "response to stress" with the sub-nodes "defence responses" and "response to wounding" were statistically significantly overrepresented among genes less responsive to aphid attack both in aos and fou <dig> mutants . these categories taken together contributed almost half of the genes whose responsiveness was negatively affected in aos and fou <dig> plants . although the majority of the genes that responded to b. brassicae infestation in wt plants were induced in the challenged aos as well, their regulation was weaker in the mutant than in wt . twenty two genes, whose products are involved in regulation of transcription and  <dig> transcripts connected to defence showed no induction or weaker up-regulation upon infestation in the aos mutant. several transcription factors and defence-related proteins were, in contrast to wt, either not induced or down-regulated in the aphid-challenged aos plants; i.e. btb and taz domain protein  <dig> , dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 2a , ethylene-responsive transcription factors erf <dig> and erf <dig>  myb family transcription factor , c2h <dig> type family protein, dark inducible  <dig> , sulfotransferase family protein , strictosidine synthase, plant defensine  <dig> , cysteine-rich antifungal protein  <dig> precursor , heat shock protein 81- <dig>  and arginase. these observations clearly show that ja signalling is important in the activation of defensive responses triggered by b. brassicae attack. however, the fact that some genes were up-regulated during infestation despite of the lack of aos enzyme activity indicates that ja signalling is, as expected, not the only system controlling gene regulation. interestingly, some of the defence-related transcripts  accumulated in the non-challenged aos plants as compared to wt, probably as a result of stress connected to the lack of ja or an imbalance between ja and sa signalling pathways.

in the fou <dig> mutant, several transcription factors and defence-related genes were already up-regulated in non-challenged plants compared to wt, indicating constant activation of defence caused by the increased endogenous ja levels . often the induction of these genes was stronger in non-challenged fou <dig> mutants in comparison to wt than in the infested wt compared to aphid free wt. in such cases no additional induction was noted in the aphid-attacked fou <dig> mutant compared to the aphid-free fou <dig> control. for other genes a slight additional induction of already up-regulated transcripts was observed in fou <dig> plants attacked by b. brassicae . out of  <dig> transcription factors and  <dig> defence-related genes up-regulated upon b. brassicae infestation in wt, but having changed aphid-triggered regulation in one or both mutants,  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively, were less up-regulated or not induced in the fou <dig> mutant in response to infestation. these results indicate that the activation of defence responses may have an overall induction threshold. a potential for an additional, aphid-triggered induction is likely limited when the basal activation of transcripts in non-challenged fou <dig> plants is already very high.

several senescence-associated genes responded to aphid attack with strong induction. overall, the intensity of aphid-induced changes in this group of genes was similar in wt and aos plants, but slightly weaker in the fou <dig> mutant. thus ja signalling seems not to be the key factor controlling the expression of senescence-associated genes upon infestation.

stress signalling in aphid-attacked plants is moderately weaker in the ja-deficient mutant
proteins involved in the perception of stress and transduction of signals play an important role in the initiation of defence responses  <cit> . after  <dig> h of sustained aphid infestation a large number of genes coding for proteins involved in calcium signalling, signal transduction and redox changes were up-regulated in the aphid-attacked wt plants.

similar responses were also triggered in the aos mutant but the average intensity of gene regulation was slightly lower compared to wt. only transcripts associated with redox processes responded to infestation with higher average induction in aos than in wt plants. these observations indicate that the ja-deficient mutant is not impaired in the perception and transduction of signals during infestation and that ja signalling plays only a partial role in the activation of these processes.

in contrast, the aphid-triggered responsiveness of genes connected to stress signalling was reduced in the fou <dig> mutant. the go category denoted "regulation of biological processes", which included "regulation of response to stimuli" and "signal transduction", was statistically significantly enriched as indicated by the go term enrichment analysis of genes that were less responsive to infestation in the fou <dig> mutant . signal transduction, calcium signalling and redox gene categories were also abundantly represented among genes that were less induced by infestation in fou <dig> than in wt . the expression of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes related to respective functional categories were either not changed, changed to a lesser extent than in wt or were oppositely regulated in response to infestation in fou <dig> plants . however, some of these genes were up-regulated in the non-challenged fou <dig> mutant in comparison to wt . thus, processes connected to the perception and transduction of signals seem to be imbalanced in the non-challenged fou <dig> mutant and their activation upon aphid infestation might be impaired.

changed ja status leads to the induction of genes connected to transport and cell wall modifications
both aos and fou <dig> mutants responded to infestation by up-regulation of genes linked to transport, while the average expression profile of these genes in wt plants remained unchanged after b. brassicae attack. go term enrichment analysis indicated that mainly go terms connected to boron and lipid transport were effected in fou <dig> . it is possible that in response to infestation, plants in which the ja synthesis rate is somehow disturbed  try to compensate for unbalanced ja signalling by induction of cellular transport.

interestingly, some genes whose products are involved in cell wall modification were differentially regulated upon infestation in the mutant plants in comparison to wt. these genes also make a considerable contribution to the set of all genes that were more induced by aphid attack in aos and fou <dig> mutants than in wt . as revealed by amigo term enrichment analysis, go terms connected to cell wall organization and aminoglycan and polysaccharide metabolic processes are overrepresented in the set of genes that were more induced by aphid attack in the fou <dig> mutant . generally these genes were slightly down-regulated in the aphid-challenged wt plants, not responsive in infested aos and slightly up-regulated in infested fou <dig>  their expression was not changed in aphid-free mutants as compared to wt. thus, it seems that hyper-activation of the ja signalling pathway in the fou <dig> mutant might cause some changes in cell walls that do not occur in the infested wt plants.

the fou <dig> mutation increases plant resistance to brevicoryne brassicae by a mechanism other than feeding deterrence
the relative susceptibility of aos, fou <dig> and wt plants to infestation with b. brassicae was evaluated in aphid fitness experiments. first instar nymphs were placed on each of the three genotypes and their asexual fecundity was monitored simultaneously. after  <dig> days the number of offspring did not differ significantly between aos and col- <dig> plants. however, aphid fecundity on the fou <dig> mutant was significantly lower when compared to the fecundity observed on aos and wt plants . to further investigate whether some anti-xenotic  factors are involved in the observed resistance of fou <dig> to b. brassicae, we employed the electrical penetration graph  technique. epg allowed us to monitor and compare the amount of time the aphids spent on various activities connected to the penetration of plant tissue and ingestion of phloem sap on fou <dig> mutants and wt plants. the electrical waveforms, corresponding to non-probing , pathway , the sieve element phase , and xylem phase  were recorded for  <dig> h and categorized according to known wave patterns corresponding to each activity. the average time spent on each activity was calculated separately for aphids feeding on fou <dig> and wt plants. the time aphids spent on non-probing, pathway, and sep was similar in the case of fou <dig> and wt plants . as phloem sap uptake from fou <dig> mutants was not restricted, we conclude that feeding deterrence was not the factor limiting b. brassicae population size on fou <dig> plants.

discussion
ja signalling contributes to aphid-triggered regulation of a wide range of genes
several experiments have proven that infestation with phloem feeders leads to extensive transcriptional reprogramming of the attacked plants. gene expression changes manifested in the current experiment in wt plants  <dig> h after infestation with b. brassicae correspond well to the changes previously observed in different a. thaliana ecotypes attacked by green peach aphid  or b. brassicae  <cit> . although such a long period of infestation may cause secondary effects linked to withdrawal of significant amounts of amino acids and sugars contained in the phloem sap, most of the transcriptional changes were similar to those observed in earlier phases of infestation   <cit> . this indicates that there is no dramatic change in the type of responses activated  <dig> h after aphid attack as compared to earlier stages of infestation.

jasmonates are physiological signals for defence. the enhanced production of ja in response to pathogen and insect attack regulates expression of many defence-related genes and may induce broad-spectrum resistance  <cit> . interestingly, many of the genes that were up-regulated in response to infestation in wt plants have shown similar induction in the non-challenged fou <dig> mutant. characterization of fou <dig> by bonaventure and co-workers revealed strong induction of defensive mechanisms resulting from overproduction of ja  <cit> . other studies have demonstrated that the application of methyl jasmonate also causes activation of the ja pathway and similar up-regulation of genes connected to defence, responses to oxidative stress, and cell wall modification  <cit> . similar changes have also been detected at the protein level  <cit> . although plants that are deficient in the production of ja do not show any symptoms of disease when grown under laboratory conditions, our study clearly shows that lack of ja negatively influences the basal expression of a wide range of genes. as expected, many of these genes encode proteins that are directly or indirectly involved in plant defence. a number of ja-dependent defence-related transcripts were induced in wt plants during b. brassicae attack, but only a few of these were activated in the challenged aos mutant, which showed that the regulation of these genes upon aphid attack is primarily controlled through ja signalling. aphid-mediated induction of many other genes was clearly affected by the aos mutation as well. although the transcription of many of these genes was apparently not dependent on the ja status in non-challenged plants, ja-derived signals comprised a significant contribution to their regulation in infested plants. aphid-induced changes in the expression of a number of transcription factors such as wrky, c2h <dig> zinc fingers, btb and taz domain containing proteins and erfs were weaker in aos than in wt, indicating the importance of ja for their induction. wrky transcription factors are important in sa-dependent defence and some are implicated in cross-talk between ja and sa signalling  <cit> . transcription factors containing ethylene responsive domains have been shown to be regulated by ja  <cit>  and to participate in plant stress responses  <cit> . they may integrate et- and ja-derived signals, possibly by interaction with the gcc box in the promoter region of ja-regulated genes  <cit>  and act as both positive and negative regulators of transcriptional changes  <cit> . transcription factors such as ap2-domain protein erf018/ora <dig>  zat <dig> and azf <dig> have been previously identified as both positive and negative regulators of ja signalling  <cit> . however, their involvement in the activation of plant defence has not been assessed yet. strong up-regulation of these genes in wt plants attacked by b. brassicae suggests that they play an important role in defence against aphids. the regulatory function of btb and taz domain containing proteins has not been established yet, but btb and taz domain protein  have been identified as essential components of the telomerase activator <dig> -mediated telomerase activation pathway  <cit> . telomerase activity is high in plants in rapidly dividing cells and reproductive organs. the induction of bt <dig> and bt <dig> in the non-challenged aos plants suggests that these genes are under negative regulation of ja. all five btb and taz proteins  are known to be readily induced by h2o <dig> and sa treatments  <cit> .

the glutaredoxin family protein grx <dig>  whose induction was eliminated in the infested aos plants, was recently identified as a regulator of ja/sa cross talk. it interacts with tga transcription factors to antagonize expression of ja-responsive genes in an npr1-dependent manner  <cit> . our results indicate that the induction of grx <dig> upon b. brassicae attack is dependent on ja levels.

the expression of eds <dig> in both non-challenged and aphid-attacked plants shows that ja levels also influence it. this is in contrast to previous reports, which describe solitary sa signalling based regulation of the eds <dig> gene  <cit> . our results suggest that regulation of eds <dig> is more complex than previously thought.

additional signals are involved in regulation of the response to b. brassicae infestation
some genes, whose expression in non-challenged plants was clearly dependent on ja responded to infestation in the aos mutant despite the lack of ja-derived signals, even though their induction was not as extensive as the induction observed in wt plants. this indicates that, in addition to ja, some other signalling mechanisms are involved in the regulation of these transcripts upon b. brassicae infestation. it is well established that the activation of invader-specific responses in plants attacked by insects is mediated by cross-talk between different signalling pathways  <cit> . in the case of insect infestation, in addition to ja, phytohormones such as salicylic acid , ethylene  and abscisic acid  play major roles in coordinating the induction of appropriate defences  <cit> . thus sa, et or aba are likely regulators of the defence responses in the absence of ja for genes such as trypsin inhibitors , tat <dig>  cyp79b <dig>  pr <dig> or asa <dig> 

induction of jaz repressors desensitizes fou <dig> response to b. brassicae attack
the transcriptional profile of the non-challenged fou <dig> genotype mimics the profile of wt plants that manifest induced defence  <cit> . in our studies many of the genes that have been shown to be involved in the response to aphid attack in wt plants were up-regulated in the non-challenged fou <dig> mutant, often showing similar or stronger intensity of changes compared to attacked wt plants . a similar induction of transcription factors and defence-related genes was observed by bonaventure and co-workers  <cit> . however, in contrast to the previously observed reaction of fou <dig> to wounding  <cit> , further induction of these transcripts upon infestation was much weaker than observed in wt plants. a similar lack of stress responses resulting from prolonged high endogenous ja levels was observed in potato plants subjected to wounding and water stress. although several of the genes involved in ja biosynthesis are induced by ja thereby creating a positive feedback loop  <cit> , there exists also a negative regulatory feedback loop protecting the plants from the adverse effects of their own defence. the constitutive up-regulation of the ja synthesis pathway in the fou <dig> mutant probably triggers this negative feedback loop, leading to desensitization of processes involved in the activation of the aphid-induced defence. jaz family proteins act to repress transcription of ja-inducible genes and thus modulate ja-mediated plant responses  <cit> . the high induction of several jaz genes in the fou <dig> mutant  indicates activation of the desensitization mechanism and may explain the reduced responsiveness of fou <dig> plants challenged with b. brassicae. the negative regulation of ja responses is delayed and takes effect some time after the proceeding induction  <cit> . the hyper activation of ja biosynthesis genes in fou <dig> plants shortly after mechanical wounding that was observed by bonaventure and co-workers  <cit>  was not observed by us after  <dig> h of sustained b. brassicae infestation. this might be due to a stealthy manner of aphid feeding that causes only minimal tissue damage. the induction of the wound-specific ja responses in aphid-infested plants is therefore much weaker than in mechanically wounded plants. in addition, the high level of jaz repressors may also tune the ja-regulated transcriptional changes in the aphid-attacked fou <dig> plants after  <dig> h.

aphid fitness is comparable on wt and aos genotypes but reduced on fou2
despite the reduced responsiveness of a wide range of defence-linked genes in the aos mutant, we did not observe any improvement in aphid fitness in comparison to wt plants. this may seem surprising as ja signalling seems to be important for plant defence mechanisms induced upon infestation. in contrast to our results, ellis and co-workers observed increased growth of green peach aphid  populations on the coi1- <dig> mutant that had defects in ja signalling  <cit> . however the coi1- <dig> line carries an additional mutation that might have influenced m. persicae responses observed by ellis and co-workers. this mutation lies in the penetration <dig>  gene encoding a glycoside hydrolase and renders the pen <dig> protein with highly reduced stability  <cit> . pen <dig> is required for indole glucosinolate-dependent pathogen-induced callose deposition  <cit> . as accumulation of callose is one of the defence mechanisms against aphid infestation  <cit> , the pen2- <dig> mutation, present in coi1- <dig> line, may contribute to the increased susceptibility of coi1- <dig> plants to infestation with m. persicae.

it is also conceivable that the expressional changes of ja-regulated genes observed by us in the aphid-infested aos mutant were sufficient to sustain the same level of aphid resistance/susceptibility as is present in wt plants. it should be noted that many genes known to be regulated by sa, aba or auxin signalling were up-regulated in aos plants. several of these can be involved in defence against b. brassicae infestation and influence aphid fitness.

as revealed by the insect fitness tests, physiological changes resulting from the fou <dig> mutation render plants more resistant to infestation than wt, despite the reduced intensity of the aphid-induced responses. as the observed resistance was not based on feeding deterrence, it is most probably based on antibiosis. various defence-related responses that are constitutively activated in fou <dig> plants, e.g. high expression of plant defensin proteins , pathogenesis-related proteins  or protease inhibitors, can exhibit an antibiotic effect on insect pests. the latter, for example, can disturb digestion and absorption of food in the insect gut  <cit> . moreover, the high activity of lox enzyme in fou <dig> plants can increase production of reactive lipid peroxides, cause oxidative damage to the insect gut and significantly decrease the nutritive quality of dietary proteins  <cit> . it should be noted, however, that the mechanism responsible for the manifestation of the fou <dig> phenotype is not fully understood. therefore, we cannot eliminate the possibility that other, unknown, features of fou <dig> could play a role in mediating aphid resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
a comparison of transcriptional profiles of non-challenged aos, fou <dig> and wt plants allowed us to identify more than  <dig> genes whose expression profiles in non-challenged plants were dependent on endogenous jasmonate status. most of these transcripts were up-regulated in fou <dig> and down-regulated in aos mutants, which points to a positive regulatory function of ja-derived compounds. many of the jasmonate-dependent genes were connected to regulation of transcription, defence responses, redox balance and cell wall modification.

upon infestation with brevicoryne brassicae, the responsiveness of many genes was changed in aos and fou <dig> plants. genes attributed to go categories connected to the regulation of transcription and responses to stress were generally less induced in both mutants. in contrast, transcripts classified as involved in cell division and development, cell wall modification and transport were more induced or not as much down-regulated in the mutants compared to wt. the observed changes in aphid-mediated responsiveness of aos had, however, no noticeable impact on aphid fitness. this may indicate that the induced responses, although weaker than in wt, were strong enough to keep the same level of resistance. alternatively, responses were mainly induced locally, so that the aphids could benefit from frequent changes of feeding places. in the fou <dig> mutant, several genes involved in defence against b. brassicae were induced in non-challenged plants. as a consequence, the transcriptional profile of non-challenged fou <dig> resembled the aphid-induced profile of wt. although additional b. brassicae mediated regulation of already induced genes was limited, the aphids' reproduction rate was negatively influenced by the fou <dig> mutation. as an array of defensive responses is constitutively activated in fou <dig> plants, the feeding aphids could not move to a leaf area where the response was not induced, as they could in the case of wt plants.

our results indicate that ja-regulated responses are important in defining susceptibility of a plant to infestation with aphids. as shown in this study, ja-derived compounds are powerful regulators of a range of defensive responses exhibited by plants attacked by aphids.
