BACKGROUND
tfss are promiscuous macromolecular transporters of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria that mediate intercellular transfer of various substrates, e.g. proteins, dna or protein-dna complexes between bacteria or between bacteria and eukaryotic cells  <cit> . the bacterial conjugation machines form a subgroup of tfss. they mediate the spread of antibiotic resistance genes and virulence traits among bacterial populations. agrobacterium tumefaciens uses an archetypal tfss composed of vird <dig>  also called coupling protein and virb1-virb <dig> mating pair formation proteins  <cit> . tfss encode two or three atpases belonging to the p-loop ntpase family  <cit> . these atpases exhibit the highest sequence conservation among tfss components  <cit> . they are also characterized by highly conserved nucleotide binding walker a  and walker b  motifs  <cit> .

by transfer dna immunoprecipitation assay, atmakuri et al. demonstrated that the three energetic components, vird <dig>  virb <dig> and virb <dig>  mediate successive early steps of the postulated t-dna translocation pathway  <cit> . they also suggested that vird <dig>  virb <dig> and virb <dig> interact with each other, and that they promote substrate transfer by both atp-independent and -dependent mechanisms. r <dig> trwk , a. tumefaciens virb <dig> and brucella suis virb <dig> homolog bsb <dig> self-assemble into hexamers and show atpase activity  <cit> . virb <dig> has a role in substrate export, whereas for virb <dig> a possible chaperone/morphogenetic function was postulated  <cit> . evidence for virb <dig> self-association  <cit>  and structural contribution to channel formation independent of atpase activity has been shown  <cit> . atpases are also considered as potential drug targets to prevent the spread of diseases. hilleringmann et al.  showed that inhibitors of helicobacter pylori atpase cagalpha  block caga transport and cag virulence  <cit> . vird4-like proteins, so called coupling proteins  are considered to link the dna transfer intermediate to, and perhaps lead it through the mating channel  <cit> . coll and coworkers proposed an elegant model based upon the crystal structure of trwb, the cp of plasmid r <dig>  <cit> . the strong structural resemblance of trwb with ring helicases suggests that the transferred ssdna might pass through the central channel of the trwb hexamer, thereby entering the translocation apparatus. atp hydrolysis would provide the energy to pump the ssdna through the trwb channel  <cit> .

recently, we reported a tfss encoded by plasmid pac3249a in a. veronii consisting of twelve orfs including three atpases  <cit> . the genetic organization of the a. veronii tfss is represented in figure  <dig>  the aeromonas species used in this study was initially proposed as a novel bacterium, a. culicicola  <cit> , which was later defined as a strain belonging to the species a. veronii  <cit> . a. veronii is a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium. in humans a. veronii can cause diseases ranging from wound infections and diarrhoea to septicaemia in immune compromised patients  <cit> . in this study, we have biochemically characterized the three atpases trae, traj and trak  by atp binding and atp hydrolysis experiments. we defined the optimum ph and temperature range of atp hydrolysis and the requirement of divalent cations.

RESULTS
overexpression and purification of tfss atpases
trae, traj and trak were overproduced in e. coli xl <dig> as his-tagged recombinant proteins and purified by affinity chromatography. purity of the proteins was checked by sds-page . trae and trak migrate at  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda in the denaturing page according to their expected molecular mass of  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  kda, respectively. however, the traj band migrates at approximately  <dig> kda, significantly faster than expected for its calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda . expression of trae, traj and trak resulted in  <dig>  g,  <dig>  g and  <dig>  g of cells per liter culture. the yield of purified trae, traj and trak was approximately  <dig>  mg,  <dig>  mg and  <dig> mg per liter culture respectively. highly pure eluted fractions of trae, traj and trak from ni-nta affinity column were concentrated to  <dig> - <dig> mg/ml for enzymatic characterization.

trae, traj and trak show atp binding activity in vitro
purified trae, traj and trak were used for nucleotide binding assays using tnp-atp and tnp-ctp. the study revealed that all three atpases show in vitro atp binding. the atp binding activity of trae was higher than that of traj and trak . in case of trae and trak, there was a shift in the absorption maximum after binding to tnp-atp . binding studies with tnp-ctp gave similar results. tnp-ctp binding affinity of trae was also higher than that of traj and trak. however, the binding affinity for all the atpases was higher for atp than for ctp .

trae, traj and trak exhibit atp hydrolysis activity
further characterization revealed that trae, traj and trak exhibit in vitro atp hydrolysis activity. the atp hydrolysis activity was highest for traj , lower for trak  and lowest for trae  . as derived from a michaelis-menten plot, the km of trae, traj and trak was  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  mm, respectively. the estimated km value for trak is significantly higher than that observed for trae and traj showing its lower affinity for atp. utilization of other nucleotides such as ctp, gtp, ttp and adp as substrate in the hydrolysis assay was also studied. maximum hydrolyzing activity for trae was found to be associated with both atp and ttp. traj hydrolysis activity was two times higher with ctp as compared to atp whereas trak hydrolyzed ttp more efficiently than other nucleotides .

to eliminate the possibility of the presence of any other contaminant atpase in the purified trae/traj/trak fractions, the purified relaxase   was used as a control in atp binding and hydrolysis experiments . neither atp binding nor atp hydrolysis activity was observed for the relaxase, ruling out the possibility of any atpase contamination.

mg2+ is the best cofactor for trae, traj and trak atpase activity
we analyzed seven different divalent metal ions  in an atpase assay to define the cofactor requirement of trae, traj and trak. mg2+ was observed to be the best cofactor followed by mn2+ for atpase activity of all the three atpases . surprisingly, atpase activity of trak in presence of mg2+ and co2+ was nearly the same . however, cu2+, zn2+, ca2+ and ni2+ were less effective in activating the atp hydrolysis activity of the atpases.

trae, traj and trak are active between ph  <dig>  -  <dig> 
the effect of different buffers on atpase activity was studied to determine the optimum ph for the atp hydrolysis activity of trae, traj and trak. a set of buffers ranging from ph  <dig>  to  <dig>  , sodium phosphate , hepes-naoh , tris-hcl , and sodium borate-naoh ) were used to determine the ph optimum. the optimal atpase activity of trae, traj and trak was observed within a ph range of  <dig>  to  <dig> , with highest activities for trae and trak at ph  <dig>  and for traj at ph  <dig>  . notably, atp hydrolysis activity for trae declined gradually beyond the optimum ph range. however, atp hydrolysis by traj and trak dropped sharply outside the optimum ph range .

optimum temperature range for trae, traj, and trak atpase activity is 36°c - 50°c
atpase activity of trae, traj and trak was measured over the temperature range of  <dig> - 80°c . approximately 60-80% of the total atpase activity for all the atpases was observed within a temperature range of  <dig> - 50°c. maximum activity for traj and trak occurred at 42°c and for trae the optimum temperature observed was 45°c. at lower temperatures , only  <dig> - 15% activity was measured. however, at temperatures between 60°c - 70°c, 15-20% of the total activity was retained. it sharply dropped to less than 5% at 80°c .

discussion
trae, traj and trak  are components of the first putative conjugative tfss of aeromonas. here we present a functional characterization of these atpases of a. veronii plasmid pac3249a. like other transport atpases, trae, traj and trak possess two conserved nucleotide binding walker a and b motifs  <cit> . the walker a motifs for trae  and traj  follow the conserved motif suggested for all p-loop ntpases   <cit> . the walker a motif of trak  shows the conserved nucleotide binding motif of cps. three atpases of the first putative tfss of aeromonas were over-expressed and purified for biochemical characterization. in vitro characterization directly demonstrated that trae, traj and trak bind and hydrolyze nucleotides effectively acting as an atpase. purified trae, traj and trak displayed mg2+ dependent atpase activity with vmax of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  nmol/min/mg protein and km of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm, respectively.

nucleotide binding assays using tnp-atp and tnp-ctp, respective fluorescent analogs of atp and ctp, showed that trae, traj and trak exhibit nucleotide binding activity. trae, traj and trak binding affinity appeared to be higher for tnp-atp than for tnp-ctp. while traj displayed weak, trae demonstrated strong nucleotide binding affinity for both tnp-atp and tnp-ctp. binding of trae and trak to tnp-atp and tnp-ctp resulted in the characteristic 10- <dig> nm shift in the absorption maximum as observed in previous studies for plasmid rp <dig> trag protein and plasmid r <dig> trwb protein  <cit> .

the atpase activity identified for trae  is comparable with the recently reported activity for its homolog r <dig> trwk   <cit> . the atpase activities observed for traj  and trak  are approximately  <dig> fold higher than the values reported for their respective homologs: plasmid ptic <dig> virb <dig> and plasmid r <dig> trwd presented weak atpase activity of  <dig> -  <dig> nmol/min/mg protein  <cit> . the weak activity of these proteins may be attributed to denaturing-renaturing conditions used during protein purification  <cit> . in this study, we maintained native conditions for the proteins throughout the extraction and purification steps which likely explain the higher atpase activities for trae, traj and trak.

the atpase activity measured for traj is approximately two fold higher than that for trae and trak. though trae, traj and trak were able to utilize both purine and pyrimidine nucleotides as substrate, we observed major differences in hydrolysis activities with respect to the different nucleotide substrates. trae exhibited approximately the same hydrolysis activity in the presence of atp and ttp but only  <dig> - 60% activity  in the presence of adp, ctp and gtp. hydrolysis activity of traj was almost twofold higher for ctp than for atp. however, traj could not hydrolyze gtp. trak utilized ttp most efficiently, followed by atp and adp. interestingly, similar results on substrate selectivity were reported for exea, an atpase involved in the type ii secretion pathway of aeromonas hydrophila  <cit> . exea hydrolyzed gtp and ctp more efficiently than atp. although highest hydrolytic rates of traj and trak were obtained with ctp and ttp, respectively, atp is the likely substrate utilized intracellularly due to the relatively low abundance of other nucleotides in vivo  <cit> .

as expected, mg2+ was the preferred divalent cation for the atpase activity of trae, traj and trak  <cit> . however, traj retained approximately 35% and trak 95% activity in the presence of co2+ when compared to mg2+. this observation was surprising considering the low concentration of co2+ and its toxic effect on bacterial cells  <cit> . ca2+ was less effective whereas cu2+, zn2+ and ni2+ were not effective in activating atp hydrolysis as was the case with the a. hydrophila atpase  <cit> . the optimum ph for trae and traj atpase activity is around  <dig> . this is comparable with the ph optimum of their respective homologs r <dig> trwk  and r <dig> pilq   <cit> . we noticed moderate atpase activity for trae, traj and trak also above 50°c. the optimal temperature range for all the atpases was between 36°c - 50°c. interestingly, for all of them, the atp hydrolysis activity observed at 30°c was lower than the activity at 50°c.

the involvement of the pac3249a tfss in conjugative plasmid transfer was confirmed by mating experiments . in triparental mating experiments with a. veronii as a donor, we could show mobilization of plasmid pdl277-oritpac3249a  to e. coli xl <dig> blue cells. further studies on putative key factors of the aeromonas tfss are in progress. we are currently characterizing the putative relaxase encoded by the pac3249a transfer region. in conjunction, these data will elucidate the molecular mechanism of the first tfss encoded by a plasmid from pathogenic aeromonas.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first biochemical characterization of conjugative transport atpases encoded by a conjugative plasmid from aeromonas. this study illustrated that the three atpases, trae, traj, and trak of the newly reported tfss of the a. veronii plasmid pac3249a bind and hydrolyze atp. ongoing efforts to solve the three dimensional structure of these atpases will help explain the substrate preferences and nucleotide binding activities of the respective proteins.
