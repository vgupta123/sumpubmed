BACKGROUND
the bet family of proteins is defined by a dual bromodomain and an extra-terminal  protein interaction domain  <cit> . the  <dig> amino acid bromodomain motif binds histones in an acetyl-lysine-dependent manner  <cit> , and proteins carrying this module are major interpreters of the epigenetic histone code  <cit> . bet proteins in particular provide a scaffold for ordered recruitment, anchoring, and regulation of various chromatin modifying factors; they also act as adaptors that bridge sequence-specific transcription factors with the basal transcription machinery  <cit> . ultimately, bet proteins regulate signal-dependent transcription as coactivators or corepressors, acting to maintain expressed or silenced states of gene expression  <cit> , and have been implicated in meiosis  <cit> , spermatogenesis  <cit> , oocyte maturation  <cit> , apoptosis  <cit> , embryonic patterning  <cit>  and especially, cell cycle control  <cit>  and oncogenesis  <cit> . there is evidence for duplication and divergence of bet genes around the time of the emergence of vertebrates; accordingly, there are multiple members in each species, with four, brd2- <dig>  known in mammals  <cit> .

the founding members of the brd <dig> subfamily of bet proteins provide an evolutionary framework for functional analysis of this group. yeast bdf <dig> encodes a basal transcription factor required for normal growth and meiosis  <cit> . the drosophila homolog of brd <dig>  female sterile homeotic- <dig> , is a maternal effect embryonic lethal gene required for oogenesis and proper segment formation and identity  <cit> . fsh interacts genetically with several homeotic genes, in some instances, via activation of trithorax genes   <cit> . interestingly, trx-g genes encode various chromatin-interacting proteins and are antagonists of chromatin repressor polycomb genes ; together, the trx-g and pc-g regulatory axes act to maintain proper homeobox  expression patterns through development  <cit> . brd <dig> is potentially a critical modulator of hox cluster chromatin modification states through its effect on these major epigenetic axes  <cit> . homologs of trx-g and pc-g genes have antagonistic and homeotic regulatory functions in mice  <cit> ; it remains to be seen if brd <dig> is involved in hox control in vertebrate development also. surprisingly, fsh rna and protein are distributed evenly in the embryo; spatial effects may result from restricted expression of co-regulators or downstream effectors  <cit> .

the mammalian versions of brd <dig> show both novel and overlapping functions compared with yeast and fly homologs. first, mouse/human brd <dig> interacts with chromatin-modifying and transcription initiation complexes to affect gene transcription as part of pol ii mediator  <cit> . specifically, brd <dig> translocates to the nucleus upon mitogen-stimulation and enhances e2f-regulated gene transcription by recruiting cell cycle regulator e2f and a histone acetyl-transferase  to target promoters  <cit> . mammalian brd <dig> thus links cytoplasmic signal transduction to e2f-mediated entry into mitosis. consistent with this, transgenic mice with lymphoid-restricted overexpression of brd <dig> up-regulate e2f target gene cyclin a, and develop b cell lymphoma and leukemia  <cit> . interestingly, several trx-g genes act as genetic regulators of e2f in drosophila  <cit> , and chromosomal abnormalities in the gene for trx human homolog mll, underlie several forms of leukemia  <cit> ; possibly, this reflects a conserved brd2/trx/e2f regulatory pathway. second, both mouse and human brd <dig> genes produce testis-specific transcripts, and are implicated in spermatogenesis and/or oocyte maturation  <cit> , thus maintaining a role in meiotic processes. in mouse oocytes,brd <dig> rna changes localization during oocyte maturation, from nuclear inclusion  to nuclear exclusion , perhaps increasing the fraction available for translation during meiotic reentry  <cit> . whether this pattern holds true, and whether brd <dig> acts as a maternal effect gene in vertebrates, is unknown. third, both novel and conserved roles for brd <dig> in development are likely. brd <dig> rnas are enriched in embryonic neuroepithelia of mouse brain ventricles, dorsal root ganglia, and spinal cord  <cit> , and mouse brd <dig> protein localizes to nuclei of proliferating neuronal precursors, but not of post-mitotic neurons  <cit> , suggesting a role in vertebrate nervous system differentiation. brd <dig> is also identified as a primary response gene transcriptionally induced in programmed cell death of rat neurons during development  <cit> . recent studies corroborate a dual role for brd <dig> in apoptosis and proliferation, showing brd <dig> translocation to the nucleus of mouse mammary epithelial cells during both proliferative and post-lactation regressive stages  <cit> , and demonstrating initiation of apoptosis in cultured cells by overexpression of brd <dig>  <cit> . consistent with a role in neuronal development, human brd <dig> has recently been identified as the major susceptibility gene for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy  <cit> . a few single nucleotide polymorphisms  in the brd <dig> promoter may account for the phenotype, suggesting that regulated expression of this gene is critical for proper development of neural tissue  <cit> .

taken together, these studies implicate brd <dig> as an important endpoint of signal transduction pathways regulating gene expression states necessary for proper differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis during development and in adult tissues  <cit> . to identify and characterize both ancient conserved and novel derived functions, and to understand the structural and functional evolution of the brd <dig> subfamily, parallel genetic and biochemical studies in different species are needed. to this end, we cloned brd <dig> cdnas in zebrafish, analyzed sequence similarities and phylogeny with other known bet genes, and characterized overall rna expression patterns during embryogenesis and in oocytes. in this report, we describe multiple brd2-related sequences in zebrafish, and present evidence for structural and expression divergence of brd <dig> paralogs in this species. the developmental profile of brd <dig> in zebrafish corroborates proposed functions from mouse and drosophila studies, as well as suggests novel functions for the gene in vertebrate development.

RESULTS
cloning and sequence analysis of zebrafish brd2-related cdnas
we cloned the zebrafish homolog of brd <dig> by screening a 15– <dig> hour embryonic cdna library . schematics of three cdna classes obtained, with encoded protein domains, are shown in figure 1a and 1b. two classes of cdna, zf <dig> and zf <dig>  are  <dig> % identical, and encode predicted proteins of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, respectively . proteins are identical except for an additional met/gly pair in zf619p, in a region of met/gly repeats, and contain features typical of the bet family  <cit> , including dual bromodomains, a nuclear localization signal , and a c-terminal et domain . the zf <dig> and zf <dig> cdnas differ from one another by several small deletions/additions, all but one of which occur in the 3'utr, and a total of  <dig> snps . all  <dig> snps in the protein-coding region result in silent mutations, suggesting negative selection, while sequences in the 3'utr show greater divergence . the nature of these differences make it likely that zf <dig> and zf <dig> represent two independent, very closely related bet genes, or, divergent alleles of the same gene, rather than alternate transcripts. the third class of cdna, zf <dig>  encodes a predicted protein of  <dig> amino acids with a single bromodomain equivalent to bromodomain  <dig> of zf626/zf <dig>  but lacking other bet features . the zf <dig> protein shares 70% identity with zf626/zf <dig> proteins across  <dig> amino acids of overlap, with  <dig> % identity and 100% amino acid conservation across the bromodomain. at the level of nucleic acid, zf <dig> and zf626/zf <dig> show  <dig> % and  <dig> % identity, respectively, over these same regions. thus, zf <dig> represents an independent bromodomain-containing gene, related to zf626/zf <dig>  but atypical of the bet family. starting at base  <dig>   <dig> bases upstream from the apparent stop of the zf <dig> open reading frame , nucleotide similarity with zf626/zf <dig> falls abruptly to  <dig> % . blast searches identify repetitive sequences related to zebrafish dana sine and l <dig> line repeat families in this discontinuous region, which was found to represent an alternative exon in zf <dig> cdna .

to identify zebrafish sequences related to zf626/zf <dig> and zf <dig>  we conducted similarity searches against ncbi, vega  and ensembl  databases . several sequences show 99–100% identity to the cloned cdnas . zf <dig> and zf <dig> cdnas derive from two distinct genomic clones, mapping to linkage group   <dig>  that are predicted to encode zebrafish brd <dig> by structural homology and genomic synteny with the major histocompatibility complex  . surprisingly, the two genomic clones originate from different zebrafish strains: clone ch211-51f <dig>  is from strain tubingen , while clone busm-12f <dig>  is from strain ab . at some point, mixing of tubingen and ab genomes must have occurred, either in the construction of the cdna library, or historically, via genetic introgression between strains. the only other known sequences corresponding to zf626/zf <dig> clones are two partial cdnas with the zf <dig> configuration of snps , and sets of ests that exhibit either the zf <dig> or the zf <dig> snp configuration . taken together, these data support the hypothesis that zf <dig> and zf <dig> represent divergent alleles of the brd <dig> gene on lg  <dig>  marked by distinct strain-specific haplotypes. we obtained independent confirmation of the genomic location of zf <dig> and zf <dig> cdna sequences by radiation hybrid mapping .

sequences directly related to cloned zf <dig>  zf <dig>  and zf <dig> cdnas were identified using blastn and blastp algorithms to search for similarities against both nucleotide and protein databases at ncbi , vega version  <dig> , and zebrafish ensembl release  <dig> . the linkage group , gene name, and conserved domains are shown for each entry. bd <dig>  bromodomain 1; bd <dig>  bromodomain 2;nls, nuclear localization signal; et, extra terminal domain. presence of conserved domains are indicated by "x". p, partial domain; d, degenerate domain;-------?, indicates truncation without stop codon;-------taa, indicates truncation with stop codon; sine/taa, indicates repeat sequence with premature stop; 19*, genomic clones from chromosome  <dig> of strain ab. ensdarg <dig> locus contains loc <dig>  and potentially encodes four transcripts: one supported by evidence , and three predicted by different algorithms .

we identified three sets of zebrafish sequences nearly identical to the region upstream of the discontinuous exon junction of zf <dig> cdna: a predicted transcript  from genomic contig nw_ <dig>  ; a predicted transcript  from ensembl zv <dig> scaffold <dig> ; and a partial cdna, brd2b, . genomic contig nw_ <dig>   and zv <dig> scaffold <dig>  sequences are identical, and map to lg  <dig>  we aligned genomic sequences with predicted and cloned transcripts, and found potential exons in locus ensdarg <dig> that correspond to each rna, including the entire zf <dig>  the discontinuous region begins at an intron/exon junction and is included as part of an exon in zf69; in xm_ <dig>  and ensdart <dig>  it is spliced as an intron. we confirmed that zf <dig> cdna derives from ensdarg <dig> on chromosome  <dig> by radiation hybrid mapping .

interestingly, the ensdarg <dig> locus exhibits possible domain shuffling. the locus is predicted to encode two database-supported transcripts, and two model-derived ab initio transcripts , each of which is identical to zf <dig> from the start of the open reading frame to the intron/exon discontinuous junction , a region encoding the first bromodomain. at this point, all transcripts diverge, consistent with alternative splicing at this site, and predict proteins with different distal domains : zf <dig> ends prematurely due to a stop codon in the included intron ; the ensdart <dig> protein has a degenerate second bromodomain and a nuclear localization signal; and genscan <dig>  fgenesh <dig>  and xm_ <dig>  each encode proteins with a distal fragment only of the second bromodomain followed by a nuclear localization signal, and the first two thirds of an et domain. other predicted features include c-terminal extensions of unknown function and an n-terminal transport-associated protein  domain . finally, partial brd2b cdna bc <dig>  encodes two canonical bromodomains, but ends prematurely without a stop codon at the nls . nw_001511437/scaffold <dig> genomic sequences account for all but two internal exons in bc <dig>  cdna that encode the second canonical bromodomain. using blastn, we found these exons in an unmapped contig, zv6_ scaffold na <dig>  that shows at least  <dig> bases of overlap with nw_ <dig>  we believe further analysis will place na <dig> within nw_ <dig>  confirming the ensdarg <dig> locus on lg  <dig> as the source of all transcript isoforms, including simbrd <dig> and brd2b. thus, several versions of brd2-related proteins may exist, with different subsets of typical bet features, and with or without additional domains .

sequence similarities and phylogeny of brd2-related sequences
blastp searches of genbank databases with zf626/zf <dig> and zf <dig> predicted proteins identify brd <dig> orthologs as highest hits in other species. zf626/zf <dig> proteins share 72–73% identity with medaka  and pufferfish  brd <dig>  and 63–64% identity with human  and mouse  brd <dig>  over the entire sequence. in comparison, zf <dig> protein shows only 67–68% and 56% identity to other fish and mammalian brd <dig> proteins, respectively, over  <dig> amino acids. all three predicted proteins are less similar to members of other bet subfamilies, namely brd <dig>  brd <dig>  and brdt. using ensdart <dig> predicted protein for comparisons gives similar results. taken together, sequence similarity, domain architecture, and genomic location data verify zf626/zf <dig> as true zebrafish orthologs of brd <dig>  and zf <dig> as belonging to the related simbrd2/brd2b locus, of uncertain position in the bet family.

to investigate the evolutionary relationship of these genes, we searched individual fish databases from oryzias, tetraodon, and takifugu genome projects for similarities to zf626/zf <dig> and zf <dig>  we identified all putative bet genes in fishes this way, and included them in phylogenetic analyses of bet vertebrate homologs . figure  <dig> shows a maximum likelihood tree with parsimony bootstrap and bayesian posterior probability support values. for all trees, zf626/zf <dig> and zf <dig> group with other brd <dig> genes, rather than with bet paralogs , and within the brd <dig> clade, zf626/zf <dig> groups with fish brd <dig> orthologs. zf <dig> and related simbrd2/brd2b sequences from chromosome  <dig> form a well-supported clade that may be seen as a subclade of the fish brd <dig> group, along with recently described onchorynchus  brd2l  <cit> . this, together with the oryzias unknown brd sequence positioned just outside of the entire brd <dig> cluster in fishes, provide evidence for at least one duplication of ancestral brd <dig> in fishes, likely as part of the whole genome duplication thought to have occurred in teleosts after the split from the tetrapod lineage  <cit> . subsequent gene loss in some fish species  <cit> , or incomplete genomic data, may explain the failure to find brd2b orthologs in tetraodon or takifugu. together, these data indicate that zf69/simbrd2/brd2b sequences represent a single brd <dig> paralogous locus on chromosome  <dig> in zebrafish. following nomenclature guidelines for paralogs  <cit> , this locus should be referred to as brd2b rather than simbrd <dig> 

developmental profile of brd <dig> and simbrd2/brd2b genes
little is known about the expression of brd <dig> in vertebrate development, except for a few intriguing studies in mouse  <cit> . we therefore examined rna patterns for brd2a during zebrafish embryogenesis, and for comparison, sampled the expression of closely related paralog brd2b. we generated probes specific for zf626/zf <dig>  and for zf <dig> ; probes could not distinguish between different transcript isoforms from the same locus however . figure  <dig> shows northern blots of brd2a and brd2b expression during development, and in dissected ovaries and adult fish. each probe detects multiple regulated transcripts and, as in other brd <dig> orthologs, one or more gonad-enriched rnas. two classes of brd2a rnas are highly enriched in ovaries and 0–4-hour post-fertilization  embryos . interestingly,brd2a transcripts appear degraded in 8– <dig> hour embryos, even though rna in these lanes is intact by etbr staining , and the same lanes show intact transcripts when probed with zf <dig> . possibly, a change specifically in brd2a turnover rate occurs during segmentation. three size classes of brd2b rnas are detected in fish from  <dig> hpf. to adult ; the largest is enriched in ovaries and 0– <dig> hour embryos. intriguingly, small brd2b-related transcripts of 70– <dig> bases are apparent in pharyngula stage embryos  and ovaries. overall, sizes of detected brd2a and brd2b rnas could potentially accommodate predicted transcripts for these genes .

to visualize expression of brd2a and brd2b in zebrafish embryos, the same probes were used for hybridization to rna in situ . both brd2a and brd2b rnas are present at high levels in the earliest embryos , consistent with their being maternally-supplied transcripts. they become enriched in optic primordia and developing brain and nervous system during segmentation . in early through mid-segmentation, as sensory, motor and interneurons appear and neural keel is forming neural rod  <cit> , both sets of rnas exhibit a periodic, ladder-like pattern of enrichment longitudinally along the trunk anterior-posterior  axis, visible over lower level ubiquitous expression . ladder patterns differ in thickness and relative intensity over time between the two genes . cross-sections through 14-somite stage embryos show ladder patterns arise in part due to strongly enriched expression in ventral somites and in ventral-lateral neural keel/rod and floorplate, which in fact give rise to motor and interneurons . the  <dig> somite embryo shows brd2a concentrated in the  <dig> brain neuromeres and tailbud and generally reduced in trunk, while brd2b remains high in brain and along the ventral trunk, but is relatively reduced in tailbud . at this stage both genes are expressed in otic placode  and optic primordia . thus, early expression of brd2a and brd2b implicate these genes in formation of the vertebrate nervous system, in agreement with studies in mice  <cit> . by  <dig> hours  expression of the two paralogs begins to differ significantly. brd2a is now restricted to head, eye, otic vesicle, neural tube, developing pectoral fin buds, ventral trunk, and dorsal post-anal tail . at higher magnification,brd2a appears enriched in neural retina and cells of otic vesicle walls , at midbrain/hindbrain boundary and specific regions of the cerebellar primordium , and in anteriorly migrating blood island cells from ventral trunk . expression of brd2b at  <dig> hours is much less restricted; highest levels are seen in cerebellum, optic primordia and ventral trunk . by  <dig> hpf, both genes are expressed in developing heart, pharyngeal arches, pectoral fin buds, and brain, but brd2b is absent from neural retina, and reduced in otic vescicle, dorsal midbrain, and caudal hindbrain compared to brd2a . cross sections of  <dig> hour embryos show additional brd2a expression in posterior lateral line primordia, pronephric ducts, and in endodermal tissues that give rise to gut, pancreas, liver, and swim bladder . at this stage, brd2a expression in neural tube is much reduced . at  <dig> hours , whole mounts show brd2a persistent in all brain subdivisions, pharyngeal arches, neural retina, otic capsule, and ventral trunk in the region of developing endoderm derivatives and pronephric duct; it is now absent from pectoral fins, and shows de novo expression in developing pharynx, esophagus, swim bladder, and atrium of the heart . in comparison, brd2b expression in head is reduced in caudal hindbrain and otic capsule, and is absent from neural retina, pharyngeal arches, heart, and ventral trunk . cross sections of  <dig> hour embryos confirm brd2a expression in brain, epithelial lining of pharyngeal arches, neural retina, endodermal derivatives, pronephric duct, and lateral line primordia . finally, both paralogs are expressed exclusively in developing swim bladder and midbrain in  <dig> day fish . thus, later developmental expression of brd <dig> paralogs provides evidence for functional divergence between these genes, and implicates brd2a in patterning and morphogenesis of brain, eye, ear, pectoral fins and digestive tract and associated organs, before terminal differentiation.

since both brd2a and brd2b appeared to be maternal transcripts, we examined gene expression in unfertilized oocytes. we found strikingly different patterns for the two genes . brd2a rna is abundant and dispersed throughout the oocyte cytoplasm in early stages i and ii, and is sometimes seen within the germinal vesicle . it starts to accumulate rather unevenly around the cortical circumference and around the outside of the germinal vesicle in early stage iii oocytes; rna is also present in surrounding follicle cells . by late stage iii-stage iv,brd2a rna is mainly limited to two thin domains on either side of the vitelline membrane: one, at the cortical circumference of the oocyte, the other, in the surrounding follicle cells . like brd2a, brd2b rna is at first dispersed throughout the cytoplasm of stage i and ii oocytes, and sometimes seen enriched within the germinal vesicle . it also accumulates near the cortical circumference and outside the germinal vesicle in early stage iii . later in stage iii, however, brd2b rna becomes strictly localized within the cortical region around the micropyle, a specialized follicle cell that marks the future animal pole . thus, both brd <dig> paralogs are implicated as vertebrate maternal effect genes, with potential roles in egg polarity and egg to embryo transition; in addition, their strikingly different localization patterns again support divergence in function.

discussion
brd <dig> structure and evolution
we describe two sets of brd <dig> paralogous sequences in zebrafish, located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  and present evidence for their structural and expression divergence. syntenic relationships between these genes and their homologs support our phylogenetic analysis. the two genomic clones from which zf <dig> and zf <dig> strain-specific cdnas derive map within the zebrafish mhc class i core locus on chromosome  <dig>  which exhibits conserved synteny with the mhc region on human chromosome  <dig> containing brd <dig>  <cit> , verifying zf <dig> and zf <dig> as true brd <dig> orthologs . interestingly, differences in gene content outside two syntenic blocks  on chromosome  <dig>  between tubingen  and ab  zebrafish strains, provide evidence for recent rearrangement, associating blocks with either mhci uba or mhci uda/ufa/uea genes, respectively . similarly, a recent intrachromosomal duplication of mhc i core region in salmonids has resulted in shuffling of mhci genes flanking psmb-rsrb blocks in trout  <cit> . in fact, the history of mhc loci across vertebrate species is one of frequent rearrangement, presumably due in part to a preponderance of retrotransposons  <cit> ; nevertheless, these same gene blocks retain conserved synteny in fish and mammals  <cit> . as brd2a resides in such a block , its conserved position within the mhc is likely functionally significant . zf <dig> and related transcripts from the brd2b locus on chromosome  <dig> group phylogenetically with brd2l from onchorynchus chromosome  <dig>  as expected, zebrafish chromosome  <dig> and trout chromosome  <dig> share synteny with eachother, and both share a number of mhc-linked genes with zebrafish chromosome  <dig> and with human chromosome  <dig> . in fact, the linkage of brd2b with mhc class ii and iii genes , as seen in the paralogous loci, is hypothesized to reflect the ancestral vertebrate mhc configuration, while the linkage of brd2a with mhc class i core genes on zebrafish chromosome  <dig> and trout genomic contig  is considered derived – the result of teleost-specific duplication, translocation and/or inversion events  <cit> .

brd <dig> paralogs in zebrafish show potential for domain-shuffling at the identical phase  <dig> exon junction, suggesting that gene duplication is not merely redundant, but has allowed functional diversification of brd <dig> to occur in fishes. for instance, brd2b isoform zf <dig> encodes a single bromodomain  protein lacking an et domain. since bd1-bd <dig> homodimers can form and bind acetylated histone tails  <cit> , zf69p dimers might act as dominant negative molecules, binding to chromatin as a cargo-less adaptors. in fact, all chromosome  <dig> isoforms encode a canonical bd <dig>  but only one also encodes a canonical bd2; three have no bd <dig> and one has a degenerate bd <dig>  this suggests a scenario whereby bd <dig> homodimerization could bring together various combinations of brd2b isoforms, with and without bd <dig>  et or terminal extensions. in addition, brd2b proteins may show differences in ligand selectivity compared with brd2a, due to paralog-specific amino acid substitutions in the variable za loop of bd <dig>  <cit> . thus, the brd2b group possibly reads different acetyl-lysine signals of the histone code  <cit> , and/or targets different promoters, in addition to being expressed differentially, compared to brd2a. cross species comparison shows the c-terminal third of et to be the least conserved domain in the brd <dig> subfamily, suggesting that varying affinities for interacting proteins might add to functional diversity. finally, only chicken, mouse and human brd <dig> have the expected configuration of kinase motifs, and the existence of intrinsic kinase function is still controversial  <cit> . indeed, recent work indicates recruitment rather than kinase activity is critical for brd <dig> nuclear translocation and transactivation functions  <cit> . contig views at vega and ensembl show the presence of multiple repetitive elements in brd <dig> loci across species, especially in fish . in fact, the chromosome  <dig> locus has sine/line elements in conserved intronic positions, where alternate splicing may produce multiple brd2b-related isoforms. possibly, these sequences allow higher frequencies of rearrangement tending to the modular nature and structural diversity of brd <dig> paralogs in zebrafish  <cit> . cloning and functional testing of these proposed isoforms and their interacting partners may provide unique insights into mechanisms of gene diversification after duplication  <cit> .

brd <dig> paralog expression and potential function in oocytes and embryos
we propose that brd2a and brd2b act as maternal effect genes in vertebrates, with a role in oogenesis and egg to embryo transition. as in drosophila, mouse and zebrafish brd <dig> rnas are present in oocytes and early embryos  <cit> ; but unlike fsh transcripts, the rnas show changing patterns of localization throughout oogenesis  <cit> , suggesting vertebrate brd <dig> may act by different proximal mechanisms. mouse and zebrafish brd2a, but not zebrafish brd2b or drosophila fsh, are also expressed in surrounding follicle cells  <cit> , reflecting perhaps a novel vertebrate function in somatic ovary for brd2a. location of both mouse and zebrafish rnas changes from diffuse cellular in early oocytes to nuclear exclusion in mature oocytes; in mouse, this final shift is correlated with the ability of oocytes to re-enter meiosis  <cit> . unique to zebrafish, cytoplasmic rnas from both brd <dig> paralogs become further localized in stage iii oocytes, supporting involvement in egg polarity. given that brd <dig> acts as a major histone-directed transcriptional co-regulator and recruitment scaffold  <cit> , it may potentially play a role here in epigenetic reprogramming of the oocyte and/or activation of the zygotic genome in the egg to embryo transition  <cit> . the localization of brd2a and brd2b into cortical and animal pole classes  <cit> , respectively, could thus reflect partitioning of related genes into separate and reciprocal regulatory domains at this critical juncture  <cit> . in addition, the fact that recruitment and translation of maternal rnas needed for zygotic transcriptional activation may be coordinated with cell cycle progression  <cit> , suggests that the proposed brd2/trx/e2f epigenetic pathway inferred from work on brd <dig> in mammals and drosophila  <cit> , might be operative here .

expression patterns of brd <dig> paralogs in zebrafish embryos support the idea of a brd2/trx/hox pathway in vertebrate development. first, brd <dig> rnas in zebrafish, and trx, ultrabithorax , and antennapedia  rnas in flies, show similar profiles: enrichment in the central nervous system of the later embryo superimposed upon lower ubiquitous levels  <cit> . second, "ladder patterns" of zebrafish brd <dig> rnas appear during somitogenesis and persist while fine-grained a-p segmental patterns of motoneurons are being established by differential homeobox expression, and interneuron axons are extending along longitudinal tracts within the embryonic spinal cord  <cit> . consistent with this, brd2a rna is enriched in ventrolateral neural keel/rod, where motorneurons and interneurons originate. third, our in situ hybridizations also show brd2a expression appearing in order in zebrafish gut and associated organs as they develop along the a-p axis, with foregut derivatives showing expression last  <cit> . interestingly, both cephalic homeosis and midgut disruptions are seen in drosophila carrying the fsh allele rancor, with loss of zygotic function that ordinarily regulates homeobox genes such as labial and deformed  <cit> . in a role analogous to fsh in drosophila patterning and segment identity  <cit> , zebrafish brd <dig> paralogs might regulate homeobox genes via trithorax-related functions in a canonical pathway for vertebrate central nervous system and/or gut patterning and morphogenesis  <cit> . two recent findings support this idea: first, drosophila fsh acts directly at the ubx promoter and synergistically activates transcription together with trxg-encoded proteins residing at distal enhancers  <cit> , confirming at the molecular level genetic interactions observed previously  <cit> ; and second, e2f regulator and tumor-suppressor prb, cooperates with a trithorax gene product, rb-binding protein  <dig> , to activate the brd <dig> promoter in differentiating mammalian cells, suggesting that brd2-dependent maintenance of active chromatin states and/or modulation of homeobox gene expression are effectors of rb-mediated differentiation  <cit> . intriguingly, then, brd2/trx/e2f and brd2/trx/hox pathways might intersect via master regulator prb, a protein known to control cell fate decisions at the crossroads of death, differentiation and division  <cit> . for instance, brd2/trx/e2f might facilitate cell cycle progression in the absence, and brd2/trx/hox promote differentiation in the presence, of active rb  <cit> . apropos of this, expression of mouse and zebrafish brd <dig> in specific precursors and primordia during times of ongoing morphogenesis and differentiation, followed by reduction upon terminal differentiation  <cit> , could also reflect brd <dig> modulation of cell death and proliferation  <cit> , which together help shape tissues and organs during morphogenesis.

the conserved linkage of brd <dig> in the vertebrate mhc – as the lone gene not directly involved in antigen presentation  <cit>  – makes some sense in light of the pathways mentioned above. first, constitutive lymphoid expression of brd <dig> results in b cell lymphoma  <cit>  characterized in part by transactivation of proliferation-promoting genes, including e2f-regulated cell cycle genes  <cit> . second, hox gene expression is dynamically modulated in adult hematopoietic lineages, where differentiation is ongoing, and hox gene dysregulation underlies various malignant leukemias, including those associated with genetic rearrangements of trithorax homolog mll  <cit> . thus, the brd2/trx epigenetic axis could be pivotal to maintenance of appropriate expression states of both hox and cell cycle genes throughout hematopoiesis, and thus to proper function of the adult immune system  <cit> .

finally, gene expression patterns implicate both mouse and zebrafish brd <dig> in continued development of brain. consistent with this, structural defects in various brain regions in jme patients suggest an underlying abnormal neural network  <cit> , with differences in brd <dig> expression during development suspected factors due to promoter snps that correlate with disease  <cit> . whether misregulation of brd <dig> results in inappropriate mitosis or cell death, or in deregulation of homeobox genes, is unknown. the function of brd <dig> during development and its connection with jme can now be analyzed by gene knockdown and ectopic expression studies in zebrafish, which is an important model for human epilepsy  <cit> 

CONCLUSIONS
zebrafish brd <dig> gene paralogs shows potential for functional diversity based on differences in structural domain configurations and distinct rna expression patterns in oocytes and developing embryos. the developmental expression pattern of zebrafish brd <dig> corroborates findings from studies in fly, mouse and human, and provides new evidence for brd <dig> function as a maternal effect and zygotic gene in vertebrates, with potential roles in oogenesis, egg to embryo transition, and proper development of the digestive and central nervous systems. brd <dig> paralogs provide unique opportunities for distinguishing the roles of maternal and zygotic genomes in constructing the vertebrate embryo, for investigating interactions with important developmental regulators, and for analyzing the extent to which divergence after gene duplication consists in functional novelty or functional partitioning.
