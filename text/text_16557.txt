BACKGROUND
normal prostate secretory epithelial cells have the specialized and unique function of synthesizing and accumulating extraordinarily high levels of citrate for secretion as a major component of prostatic fluid . this requires a continual availability of carbon sources for the intramitochondrial production of acetyl coenzyme a and oxalacetate for the synthesis of citrate. the former is derived from glucose via pyruvate formation and oxidation, and the latter is derived from aspartate via transamination with glutamate . in these specialized prostate cells, aspartate is an essential amino acid that is derived from circulation. as represented in rat ventral prostate glandular epithelial cells, the cellular concentration of aspartate is ~ <dig>  mm  <cit> . the plasma level of aspartate is ~ <dig>  mm. therefore the uptake and accumulation of cellular aspartate occurs against a 40: <dig> concentration gradient. this is achieved by the existence of a na+-dependent high-affinity l-aspartate transport process with kinetic properties that result in cellular accumulation of aspartate from circulation  <cit> . the kinetic properties are representative of the na+- dependent high-affinity glutamate-aspartate transporters referred to as the xag- class of amino acid transporters. the general characteristics of this class include: plasma membrane transporters; transport either glutamate or aspartate with high affinity; na+ coupled transport; no or low affinity for neutral and basic amino acids  <cit> .

an important unresolved issue was the identification of the putative prostate high-affinity l-aspartate transporter. subsequent to our kinetic identification of the transport process, significant advances have been achieved in the genetic and protein identification and characterization of the xag- transporter class as eaats . this class includes eaat <dig> ; eaat <dig> ; eaat <dig> ; eaat <dig>  the dominance of the reported studies in excitatory cells has resulted in the eaats being described functionally as glutamate transporters. nevertheless, we focused on the possibility that a member of this class of transporters, particularly the ubiquitously expressed eaac <dig>  could be the functional high-affinity l-aspartate transporter in prostate cells. our earlier studies  demonstrated that the high-affinity transport of aspartate is regulated by testosterone, which appeared to be dependent upon its regulation of gene expression of a putative transporter. in this present report we show that eaac <dig>  is expressed in normal rat prostate epithelial cells, in human prostate glandular tissue, and in human prostate malignant cell lines; and eaac <dig> functions as a high-affinity l-aspartate transporter in rat and human prostate cells; and eaac <dig> expression is regulated by testosterone and prolactin.

RESULTS
in the absence of published information regarding the identification of specific aspartate transporters in prostate, we elected to determine if any members of the eaat class were expressed in prostate cells. because we had identified the high-affinity l-aspartate transport process in rat ventral prostate cells  <cit> , we first determined the expression  of eaats in these cells; and, for comparison, in brain tissue that is known to express these transporters. as shown in figure  <dig>  eaats 1â€“ <dig> are expressed in brain tissue as expected. in rat ventral prostate cells: eaat  <dig> is not expressed; eaat  <dig> and eaat  <dig> seem to be weakly expressed. most importantly, eaac <dig> is prominently expressed in the ventral prostate cells. this led us to expect that eaac <dig> might be the functional high-affinity l-aspartate transporter in prostate cells.

the establishment of eaac <dig> as the functional high-affinity l-aspartate transporter requires the demonstration that altered expression of eaac <dig> results in altered aspartate uptake. in order to determine this relationship we elected to employ the human prostate pc- <dig> cell line. however, it was necessary to determine if pc- <dig> cells exhibit aspartate uptake under the conditions representative of the high-affinity l-aspartate transport that we had established in rat ventral prostate cells. as shown in figure  <dig>  pc- <dig> cells exhibit high-affinity l-aspartate uptake. we also determined if pc- <dig> cells contained membrane-associated eaac <dig>  and figure  <dig> establishes the presence of eaac <dig> transporter protein. these relationships in the pc- <dig> cells made it possible to determine the effect of eaac <dig> knock-down on the abundance of eaac <dig> transporter and on the high-affinity transport of aspartate. figure  <dig> shows that the abundance of eaac <dig> transporter is effectively down-regulated in sirna transfected pc- <dig> cells. since sirna appeared to be more effective than sirna subsequent experiments were carried sirna. correspondingly, the results demonstrate that knock-down of eaac <dig> markedly decreases the high-affinity uptake of aspartate by pc- <dig> cells. the specificity of the sirna for eaac <dig> is demonstrated by the absence of knock-down of eaat <dig> that is also expressed in these cells. it is evident that some aspartate transport activity remains after sirna knock-down of eaac <dig>  this residual activity is likely partly due to some existing low level of eaac <dig>  and also due to some additional aspartate transport mechanism that we earlier described as low-affinity transport  <cit> . nevertheless, the major point is the demonstrated down regulation of eaac <dig> along with significant reduction of aspartate transport.

an earlier report  <cit>  demonstrated that testosterone increased the high-affinity transport of aspartate in the rat ventral prostate cells. therefore we surmised that, if eaac <dig> is the high-affinity transporter in prostate cells, testosterone treatment should be expected to increase the expression of eaac <dig> in these cells. figure  <dig> shows that exposure of the ventral prostate cells to testosterone results in a >100% increase in the level of eaac <dig> transporter. this correlates with our earlier study of testosterone stimulation of high-affinity l-aspartate uptake in the prostate cells.

in addition to testosterone, prolactin also regulates citrate production and key metabolic genes, including maat gene expression ; which caused us to consider the possibility that prolactin might also be important in the regulation of aspartate transport. therefore, the effect of prolactin was determined, along with testosterone, on the high-affinity l-aspartate transport in the rat ventral prostate cells. in this study, the donor rats were castrated and bromocryptine-treated to minimize effects of endogenously produced hormones. the results  show that prolactin and testosterone significantly increase the high-affinity transport of aspartate by 180% and 140%, respectively. moreover, treatment with cyclohexamide attenuates the stimulatory effect of prolactin and testosterone; thereby indicating the dependency of the hormonal effects on gene expression. the effects of testosterone corroborate our earlier report  <cit> . based on this observation, we determined the effect of prolactin on the expression of eaac <dig> and correspondingly on aspartate transport in normal rat ventral prostate epithelial cells. figure  <dig> shows that prolactin treatment increases the level of eaac1; and correspondingly increases the uptake of aspartate. it is important to note that the level of hormonal stimulation is less than shown in figure  <dig>  which is a reflection of the endogenous hormonal effect in the normal animals  <cit> . previous studies have shown that prolactin regulation of metabolic genes in prostate cells is mediated via direct stimulation of the pkc signalling pathway and is mimicked by phorbol ester  <cit> . for this reason we also determined the effects of tpa . the stimulation of eaac <dig> and aspartate transport by tpa as well as by prolactin is indicative of the involvement of pkc in the regulation of the eaac <dig> gene . these results further corroborate the relationship between eaac <dig> and high-affinity l-aspartate transport in prostate cells, and also establish that prolactin as well as testosterone is involved in the hormonal regulation of eaac <dig> 

we were fortunate to obtain some archived human prostate tissue samples , which we analyzed for eaac <dig> expression. at the same time we determined the expression of eaac <dig> in lncap, du- <dig>  and pc- <dig> cells. figure  <dig> shows that eaac <dig> is expressed in human normal and hyperplastic glandular tissue as well as in the three malignant cell lines. thus eaac <dig> expression seemingly is ubiquitous in rat and human prostate cells.

discussion
the present studies establish that alterations in the expression and level of eaac <dig> transporter by sirna knock-down or by hormonal stimulation are consistently accompanied by corresponding alterations in the high-affinity transport of aspartate. these studies in concert with our earlier reports  <cit>  establish that eaac <dig> is the functional transporter that is responsible for this high-affinity l-aspartate transport in rat and human prostate cells. this provides the physiological function for cellular accumulation of aspartate from circulation as is needed for their specialized function of net production of high levels of citrate. in these cells, aspartate is an essential amino acid that must be derived from circulation. the aspartate transporter km ~ <dig> um aspartate  and other kinetic properties described earlier  <cit>  provide for aspartate uptake and cellular accumulation against the existing 40: <dig> concentration gradient  across the cell membrane. in addition, in the presence of a plasma concentration of  <dig> um glutamate  <cit> , the high affinity uptake of aspartate still occurs at greater than 50% of its maximal rate  <cit> . the enhancement of the high-affinity l-aspartate transport by the trans-stimulatory effect of high intracellular citrate provides additional effectiveness of the transporter for aspartate uptake by the prostate cells  <cit> . the importance of aspartate and eaac <dig> as the high-affinity l-aspartate transporter in the unique function and citrate-related intermediary metabolism of prostate cells is depicted in figure  <dig> 

the present study provides the first report of eaac <dig> expression in prostate cells. more importantly, this report coupled to earlier studies  <cit>  provides  the first definitive identification of eaac <dig> as a preferential functional l-aspartate transporter. the operation of eaac <dig> as a high-affinity l-aspartate transporter in prostate cells differs from its dominant focus as a glutamate transporter in excitatory cells. as such, the kinetic properties of eaac <dig> as a high-affinity l-aspartate transporter have not been established for other mammalian cells. king et al  <cit>  reported that l-aspartate uptake in heart myocytes is mediated by a high affinity sodium-dependent transporter , and suggested that the transport might be associated with the expression in heart of eaac <dig>  similarly, mammary cells reportedly express an xag- transporter that exhibits a significantly higher affinity for aspartate  than for glutamate ; thereby potentially demonstrating a selectivity for aspartate transport  <cit> . in an analogous situation, besson et al  <cit>  reported that the nervous tissue-specific drosophila eaat <dig> preferentially functions as a na+-dependent high-affinity aspartate transporter

the in situ operation and preference of plasma membrane-associated eaac <dig> either as a high-affinity glutamate transporter or as a high-affinity aspartate transporter is determined by the intracellular and extracellular environment of the cell, and by the functional/metabolic activities of the cell. unlike prostate cells, most mammalian cells synthesize aspartate and have no requirement for the extraction of aspartate from circulation. moreover, glial cells and central neurons operate in the environment of cerebrospinal fluid and localized synaptic junctions that have a much different milieu composition than the common interstitial fluid environment of most cells. even among cells that are exposed to the same interstitial fluid environment, the activity of plasma membrane transporters can differ as a result of differences in the intracellular activity and composition. this is particularly illustrated by the pronounced trans-stimulatory effect  of the high intracellular citrate concentration that exists in prostate cells but not in other mammalian cells  <cit> . therefore, it is not surprising that eaac <dig> shows variability in different cells in its functional preference for aspartate transport or for glutamate transport.

the effect of testosterone and prolactin on eaac <dig> and high affinity l-aspartate transport has two important implications. as already discussed, the hormonal up-regulation of eaac <dig> and corresponding increase in aspartate transport provide evidence that eaac <dig> is the functional high-affinity l-aspartate transporter. another implication relates to the regulation of the major prostate function of citrate production and secretion into prostatic fluid. both hormones regulate  prostate citrate production. they do so by regulation of gene expression of key regulatory enzymes in the pathway of citrate metabolism; pyruvate dehydrogenase, maat and m-aconitase  <cit> . the present report adds the eaac <dig> transporter gene  expression as a key step in the pathway to net citrate production. this is consistent with the regulation of maat gene expression; so that the aspartate substrate does not become limiting for the enzyme reaction in the direction of oaa production for citrate synthesis . we have shown that prolactin regulation of maat gene expression is mediated via the diacylglycerolâ†’ pkcepsilon â†’ ap- <dig> signaling pathway . the stimulation of eaac <dig> expression by both prolactin and tpa suggests that this pkc pathway is involved in regulation of the slc1a <dig> gene, which we are now studying. millar and shennan  <cit>  reported that treating lactating rats with bromocryptine reduced d-aspartate uptake by mammary tissue explants and suggested that the transport of anionic amino acids by the rat mammary gland is regulated by prolactin. it is of interest that phorbol ester activation of select pkc isoforms in some cells causes increased association of subcellular eaac <dig> with the plasma membrane; which increases glutamate transport  <cit> . whether or not such a mechanism applies to eaac <dig> and aspartate transport in prostate cells needs to be investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
aspartate uptake and utilization are essential requirements for the unique function of production and secretion of extraordinarily high levels of citrate by prostate epithelial cells. to achieve this, these cells posses a high-affinity l-aspartate transporter that serves to extract aspartate from circulation. we now show that eaac <dig> is expressed in human and rat prostate cells and functions as the high-affinity l-aspartate transporter in prostate cells. the expression of eaac <dig> and the corresponding high-affinity transport of aspartate are up-regulated by testosterone and by prolactin, which correlates with the hormonal regulation of prostate citrate production. eaac <dig> provides the high-affinity transporter for prostate cell uptake and accumulation of aspartate from circulation, which provides the source of oaa that is essential for the synthesis and secretion of extraordinarily high levels of citrate. the identification of eaac <dig> as the aspartate transporter now permits studies of the slc1a <dig> gene for identification of the mechanism of testosterone and prolactin regulation, and permits studies of the kinetic relationships and mechanisms of preferential and enhanced aspartate transport by eaac <dig> in prostate and other cells. moreover, the identification of eaac <dig> in human normal and hyperplastic glandular tissue raises the need to determine its expression in prostate adenocarcinomatous glands; and such a study is in progress.
