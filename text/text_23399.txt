BACKGROUND
motor evoked potential  is recorded from peripheral muscles after stimulation of the primary motor cortex by transcranial magnetic stimulation . tms produces mep followed by a period of electromyogram  silence during voluntary muscle contraction. this period of silence is known as the cortical silent period . while spinal mechanisms may be active in the early part  of csp, the cortical origin of at least the later part  of csp has been proven in several previous studies  <cit> . mep amplitude fluctuates with tms intensity, muscle contraction  <cit> , and the difficulty of the task  <cit> . several studies have investigated the relationship between mep amplitude and csp duration; however, this relationship remains unclear. for example, wu et al.  <cit>  reported that a large mep amplitude induces csp for a long duration, whereas gilio et al.  <cit>  found that csp duration was not related to the mep amplitude.

recently, paired-pulse tms has become a useful tool for testing cortical inhibition or facilitation of the human motor cortex. when a subthreshold conditioning pulse  and a suprathreshold test pulse  were applied to the motor cortex through the same coil, mep evoked by the test pulse was inhibited at interstimulus intervals  between  <dig> and  <dig> ms  <cit> . this phenomenon is known as short-interval intracortical inhibition   <cit> . the mechanism of sici was reported to result from synaptic interaction occurring within m <dig>  and it appeared to be mediated at the cortical level  <cit> . therefore, a subthreshold s <dig> suppressed the size of both the descending spinal cord volleys and mep induced by a suprathreshold s <dig>  <cit> . in pharmacological research, the mechanism of sici has been explored in more detail, and the involvement of gamma-aminobutyric acid  has been suggested  <cit> . in contrast, mep is facilitated at isi greater than  <dig> ms, which is known as intracortical facilitation   <cit> . because the intensity of the conditioning stimulus was too weak for enhancement of any effects on spinal h reflexes, it was considered that icf occurred within the cerebral cortex  <cit> . however, di lazzaro et al.  <cit>  suggested the possibility that the conditioning stimulus reflects the excitability of spinal motoneurons. although there is evidence for the origin of sici, there is less direct information on the origin of icf.

there have been some studies concerning csp duration after sici or icf during muscle contraction  <cit> , whereas many studies of sici or icf have been conducted under resting conditions  <cit> . mep amplitude induced by paired-pulse tms was reported to change during muscle contraction at 5%–50% of maximum voluntary contraction   <cit> . some studies showed that csp was shortened or prolonged by paired-pulse tms  <cit> ; however, these studies used different intensities of paired-pulse tms to adjust the mep amplitude. therefore, it is unclear whether changes in csp duration are induced by the change in magnetic stimulation intensities or by sici or icf.

the purpose of this study was to confirm the effects of muscle contractions and stimulus intensities on mep amplitude and the duration of csp induced by single-pulse tms and to clarify the effects of sici and icf on csp duration.

RESULTS
the  <dig> mv tms intensity and active motor threshold  were  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % , respectively, of the maximum stimulator output. figure  <dig> shows representative waveforms of mep during muscle contraction of 30% emg. we were able to clearly observe csp for all muscle contraction levels and all tms intensities.

effects of muscle contraction on mep amplitude and csp duration 
results of one-way analysis of variance  showed that mep amplitude changed significantly with increased muscle contraction  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; figure 2a). the mep amplitude  was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv at 10% emg,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv at 30% emg,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv at 50% emg, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv at 70% emg. the mep amplitude at 30%, 50%, and 70% emg was significantly larger than that at 10% emg . furthermore, the mep amplitude at 50% and 70% emg was significantly larger than that at 30% emg . no significant difference in the mep amplitude was observed between 50% and 70% emg.

csp duration  was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms at 10% emg,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms at 30% emg,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms at 50% emg, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms at 70% emg. no significant differences in csp duration were observed among the muscle contraction levels  =  <dig> , p >  <dig> ; figure 2b).

effects of tms intensity on mep amplitude and csp duration 
results of one-way anova showed that mep amplitude changed significantly with increases in tms intensity  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; figure 3a). the mep amplitude at 10% emg was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv at 100% amt,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv at 110% amt,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv at 120% amt,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv at 130% amt,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv at 140% amt,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv at 150% amt, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv at 160% amt. no significant difference in the mep amplitude was observed at high-output stimulation intensities of >140% amt.

results of one-way anova showed that csp duration changed significantly with increases in tms intensity  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; figure 3b). the mean csp duration was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms at 100% amt,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms at 110% amt,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms at 120% amt,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms at 130% amt,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms at 140% amt,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms at 150% amt, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms at 160% amt. csp duration was prolonged with increasing stimulus intensity. csp duration at 160% amt was significantly prolonged compared with those at all other stimulus intensities.

effects of paired-pulse tms on mep amplitude and csp duration 
the mean  conditioning pulse intensity was  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, and the test pulse intensity was  <dig>  ±  <dig> %. figure  <dig> shows the representative waveforms of mep induced by paired-pulse tms at 10% emg. results of one-way anova showed that mep amplitude was significantly changed by paired-pulse tms  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; 10% emg, f =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; 30% emg, f =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; 50% emg, f =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). the mean  mep amplitude at rest was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv . the mep amplitude induced by sici was significantly smaller than that induced by single-pulse tms . furthermore, the mep amplitude induced by icf was significantly larger than that induced by single-pulse tms  . the mep amplitude at 10% emg was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv   and that at 30% emg was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv  . at both 10% and 30% muscle contraction levels, the mep amplitude induced by sici was significantly smaller than that induced by single-pulse tms and icf . furthermore, the mep amplitude induced by icf was significantly larger than that induced by single-pulse tms at 10% and 30% muscle contraction levels . the mep amplitude at 50% emg was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv , and the mep amplitude induced by sici was significantly smaller than that induced by single-pulse tms and icf . in contrast, no significant differences were observed in the mep amplitude induced by single-pulse tms and icf .

results of one-way anova showed that the decrease and increase ratios changed significantly with increases in muscle contractions  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; increase ratios, f =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; figure 6). the decrease ratios with sici were  <dig>  ±  <dig> % ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % , and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % . the ratio at rest was significantly higher than that at all muscle contraction levels , and no significant differences were observed among the different muscle contraction levels. the increase ratios with icf were  <dig>  ±  <dig> % ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % , and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % . the ratio at rest was significantly higher than that at 30% and 50% emg , and no significant differences were observed among the different muscle contraction levels.

results of one-way anova showed that csp duration changed significantly with paired-pulse tms  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; 30% emg, f =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; 50% emg, f =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; figure 7). csp duration at 10% emg was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms . csp duration at 30% emg was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms . csp duration at 50% emg was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms . at all muscle contraction levels, csp shortened significantly with sici compared with single-pulse tms and icf . however, no significant differences were observed in csp duration between single-pulse tms and icf.

no significant correlations were observed between mep amplitude and the duration of csp induced by single-pulse tms and after sici and icf at 10%, 30%, and 50% emg .

discussion
we confirmed that csp duration is affected by tms intensity but not by the muscle contraction level or mep amplitude. our new findings were that csp is shortened with sici, but it is not altered by icf, when the tms intensity is constant. these results indicate that after sici, csp duration is affected by the activity of inhibitory intermediate neurons that are activated by the conditioning sici stimulus.

effects of muscle contraction on mep amplitude and csp duration 
the mep amplitude increased with an increase in muscle contraction intensity from 10% to 50% emg in the present study. this result is in agreement with the results of previous reports  <cit> . however, we did not observe an increase in mep amplitude above 50% emg despite the increase in mep amplitude due to an increase in muscle contraction intensity. the most motor units of the first dorsal interosseous  muscle are recruited below 50% mvc  <cit> , whereas the maximum recruitment threshold of other large muscles is 95% or 90% mvc  <cit> . we consider that an increase in mep amplitude in a muscle contraction state above 50% emg could not be observed because most of the fdi motor units had already been recruited.

in contrast, csp duration was always constant and was not influenced by muscle contraction intensity. csp results from the activity of inhibitory intermediate neurons attached to pyramidal cells of the motor cortex  <cit> . because the stimulation threshold that induces csp is of a lower intensity than that which induces mep  <cit> , inhibitory intermediate neurons that generate csp and pyramidal cells involved in generating mep through stimulation at 100% amt can be stimulated  <cit> . the results of our experiment show that although changes in cortical excitability as a result of muscle contraction have an effect on the excitability of pyramidal cells for mep generation, they have no effect on the inhibitory intermediate neurons that induce csp. it has been reported that high mep amplitude induces a long csp  <cit> , but the results of experiment  <dig> support reports that mep amplitude and csp fluctuate independently  <cit> .

effects of tms intensity on mep amplitude and csp duration 
we did not observe an increase in mep above a stimulation intensity of 140% despite the mep amplitude increasing with an increase in tms intensity. because many motor units are already excited at a stimulation intensity above 140% amt, we may not have observed a further increase. nonetheless, csp was prolonged with tms intensity increase from 100% amt to 160% amt. these results support the reports by orth et al.  <cit>  and kimiskidis et al.  <cit>  and are considered to show that csp is not related to muscle contraction intensity or mep amplitude, but it varies depending on magnetic stimulation intensity.

effects of paired-pulse tms on mep amplitude and csp duration 
sici and icf were also observed at 10% and 30% emg, similar to sici and icf at rest. in contrast, although sici was observed at 50% emg, icf was not. ilić tv et al.  <cit> reported that sici was observed with paired-pulse stimulation during approximately 5%–10% muscle contractions, whereas icf was attenuated compared with icf at rest. in the present experiment, the facilitation effect as a result of icf was attenuated with increasing muscle contraction intensity from 10% to 50% emg. icf disappeared at 50% emg, but many motor units were already in a mobilized state at 50% emg, similar to the results in experiment  <dig>  which could explain why no icf occurred.

in contrast, sici was observed even at an intensity of 50% emg, despite the inhibitory effect resulting from sici attenuation with an increase in muscle contraction intensity. ortu et al.  <cit>  measured mep resulting from paired-pulse stimulation at 10%, 25%, and 50% mvc and reported observing sici at 10% mvc but not at 25% or 50%. that study was conducted at an intensity of test stimuli that induced a  <dig> mv mep amplitude at each muscle contraction intensity. the present study may have produced different results because the magnetic stimulation intensity that induced  <dig> mv at rest was used at all muscle contraction levels.

csp was significantly shortened with sici compared with single-pulse tms and icf at all muscle contraction intensities, whereas no significant differences in csp duration were observed between icf and single-pulse tms. a few studies have reported the modulation of csp by paired-pulse tms  <cit> , but the results have not been consistent. in previous studies, gabaa receptors were reported to be involved in the sici mechanism  <cit> . csp is reported to occur when pyramidal cells in the cortex that sustain muscle contractions are suppressed  <cit> . however, gabaa-mediated inhibitory interneurons were excited because of the conditioning pulse of sici and because the activity of inhibitory intermediate neurons that cause csp and the proliferation of pyramidal cells involved in mep were suppressed, csp was shortened. there are many uncertainties about the action mechanism of icf. di lazzaro et al.  <cit>  reported that icf is a change caused by the excitability of the spinal cord, whereas nakamura et al.  <cit>  suggested the possibility of facilitation within the cortex. our present experiment did not clarify whether the influences of the intracortical or subcortical network cause icf. however, under conditions in which isi of paired-pulse stimulation was  <dig> ms, it was clear that this did not change csp, although mep was increased.

CONCLUSIONS
this study investigated the effects of muscle contractions and stimulus intensities on mep and csp induced by single-pulse tms and the effects of sici and icf on csp duration. our major results were that csp is affected by tms intensity but not by the muscle contraction level or mep amplitude. in addition, although tms intensities were constant, csp was significantly shortened with sici compared with single-pulse tms and icf. these results indicated that after sici, csp is affected by the activity of inhibitory intermediate neurons that were activated by the conditioning sici stimulus.
