BACKGROUND
schwann cells , the main glial cell type of the peripheral nervous system  <cit> , are crucial for normal nerve function and long-term integrity of peripheral nerves  <cit> . since sc provide support functions for myelinated as well as nonmyelinated axons, they populate not only heavily myelinated nerves  but also largely nonmyelinated nerves . during development, appropriate numbers of axons and sc are matched by tightly regulated proliferation as well as apoptosis  <cit> . sc migrate from nerve trunks along developing axons to distal nerve regions. several signaling molecules have been shown to regulate sc migration. the neuronal growth factor neuregulin   <dig>  acting through erbb2/erbb <dig> tyrosine kinase receptors  <cit> , stimulates sc motility, as demonstrated in primary rat sc culture  <cit>  or with an immortalized sc precursor cell line  <cit> . studies in zebrafish revealed an essential role of nrg <dig> type iii, erbb <dig> and erbb <dig> for sc migration in vivo  <cit>  and we have recently shown that nrg <dig> type iii/ erbb signaling, via regulation of apoptosis in proximal axonal regions, is essential for sc colonization of distal sympathetic axons  <cit> . in addition to nrg <dig>  also glial cell-line-derived growth factor , a tgf- beta related growth factor, has been suggested to control sc migration. when expressed in a layer of fibroblasts, gdnf promotes sc emigration from sciatic nerve sections. this activity depends on a non-canonical, ret kinase independent  <cit>  signaling pathway in which the neural cell adhesion molecule  is employed in combination with the ligand binding gdnf family receptor alpha  <dig>   <cit> . a stimulatory effect of gdnf on sc migration was also observed in several in vitro migration assays using an immortalized sc precursor cell line suggesting that gdnf  serve as chemotactic and chemokinetic molecules during peripheral nerve development  <cit> . here, we addressed whether endogenous gdnf plays a role for sc migration along sympathetic nerves of mouse embryos. we took advantage of a sc migration assay using scg explants  <cit>  and time lapse imaging, which allows to study sc migration along outgrowing axons  <cit> . unexpectedly, we found that sc migrate normally along sympathetic axons in the absence of gdnf signaling. furthermore, in vivo analyzes of late embryonic sciatic nerves indicated that sc migration is not dependent on gdnf there.

mice and tissue preparation
time pregnancy matings of nmri and gdnf ko mice  <cit>  were performed overnight and the day of the vaginal plug was considered as day  <dig> . additional nmri mice, obtained from charles river, were mated during daytime. at embryonic day  <dig>  to  <dig> , mothers were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the embryos were harvested by cesarean section. gdnf  mice were maintained by breeding to c57/bl <dig> mice and intercrosses.

sc migration assay, pharmacological treatment and quantification
the assay used to analyze sc migration was recently described  <cit> . briefly, superior cervical ganglia  were dissected from mouse embryos at embryonic day  <dig> -  <dig>  . after washing in dpbs scgs were put on a three dimensional matrix of collagen. collagen was prepared from rat-tails and the matrix was assembled according to the protocol of t. ebendal  <cit> . scgs were treated with nerve growth factor  to facilitate optimal axonal development and allow sc migration along elongating axons . pp <dig>  <cit>  a compound inhibitor for src-kinases and ret kinase was used at a concentration . pp <dig> was either added at day in vitro   <dig> or at div <dig>  in the latter case the assay was stopped at div <dig>  analyzes of sc proliferation were performed by measuring the phh3/ dapi ratio in sampled areas of  <dig> control and  <dig> pp <dig> treated explants. for analyzes of sc migration, distances from the explant to leading scs of  <dig> control and  <dig> pp <dig> treated explanted ganglia were measured. when indicated aphidicolin  was added to the cultures.

western blot for gdnf
rat-tail collagen samples at different dilutions, proteins from rat adrenal gland, rat cerebrum, pc <dig> cells and recombinant murine gdnf  were loaded on a 13% sds-acrylamide gel for electrophoresis. proteins were transferred onto a pvdf membrane  using wet-blotting technique. after transfer, membranes were washed with tbst and blocked with 10% dry milk  in tbst for  <dig> h at room temperature. for detection of gdnf, membranes were incubated with primary anti-gdnf antibody  at 4°c overnight. the primary antibody treatment was followed by treatment with hrp-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody  for  <dig> h at 4°c. gapdh was used as a loading control for positive controls from rat tissue samples. labelled proteins were detected by using western lightning® plus–ecl, enhanced chemiluminescence substrate . all blots were captured with amersham hyperfilmtm ecl .

immunohistochemistry and statistical analyses
immunohistochemical stainings for s <dig>  phospho-histone h <dig>  thyrosine hydroxylase  and nuclear counterstaining with dapi  were performed according to standard protocols. briefly, explant containing collagen gels were fixed with 4% pfa at the end of an experiment and directly processed for whole mount immunohistochemistry. tissue was blocked in pbs containing 10% normal donkey serum and 2% triton x  <dig> for  <dig> hours with consecutive antibody incubation in blocking solution over night. the next day, after washing, the tissue was incubated with labeled secondary antibodies . explants used for whole mount immunohistochemistry were dried on microscope slides, for best analyses in two dimensions and mounted in aqueous mounting medium . images were taken by conventional fluorescence and non-fluorescence microscopy with olympus and leica microscopes respectively. measurements were performed via the software imagej . for statistical analyzes of quantitative data graphpad prism software was used.

time lapse imaging
where stated, time-lapse recordings were performed in near live time temporal resolution. the recorded frame rate is  <dig> minutes for s <dig> and s <dig> and  <dig> minutes for s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  the scale bars represent  <dig> μm. for time lapse recordings a conventional inverse microscope setups  connected to an incubation chamber and a heating unit was used to facilitate humid conditions with 37c° and 5% of co <dig> 

semi-thin sections
sciatic nerves were dissected from fixed e <dig>  mouse embryos. after postfixation the nerves were processed and embedded in epon . sectioning was performed with an ultramicrotom  and sections were stained with methylenblue/azurii.

RESULTS
early blockade of src and ret kinases disrupts axonal sc colonization
binding of gdnf to its gpi anchored receptor gfra <dig>  can induce two distinct signaling pathways. the first described was signaling via recruitment of ret tyrosine kinases to the gdnf/ gfra <dig> complex. the more recently observed pathway works via interaction with the neural cell adhesion molecule . the latter way was described to utilize fyn a src-related kinase in the signaling cascade  <cit> . blockade of both pathways, by inhibition of src and ret kinases with pp <dig>  at day in vitro   <dig>  disrupted sc colonization of scg axons . this can additionally be appreciated in time-lapse recordings . while sc migrate along axons in control explants , migrating sc were virtually absent when explants were treated with pp <dig> .

late blockade of src and ret kinases reduces sc proliferation
to directly address the effect of ret and src kinase signaling inhibition on sc migration, pp <dig> was administered at div <dig> , when numerous axon-associated sc already migrated away from the ngf treated explants. migration distances from the scg explant to the leading sc were measured at div <dig> . unexpectedly, under these conditions only a small  reduction in sc migration distances was observed . additional time-lapse recordings  show migrating sc in the pp <dig> treated sample similar to the control. these findings argue against a direct role of src or ret kinases in sc migration along sympathetic axons. however, we want to note that sc motility seems by trend slightly reduced after pp <dig> treatment .

if a scg explant is solely treated with ngf, large numbers of sc migrate away from the explant to distal axonal regions . we speculate that sc precursors must massively proliferate before the onset of migration. to test whether pp <dig> affects sc proliferation we determined phh3/dapi ratios of scg explants treated with pp <dig> at div <dig>  we observed a reduction in the number of proliferating sc in pp <dig> treated samples compared to controls . in addition more fragmented sc nuclei were visible after pp <dig> treatment, in line with increased sc apoptosis . this suggests that the failure in colonization of sympathetic axons after pp <dig> treatment at div <dig> might result from reduced numbers of premigratory sc in the explants.

blocking sc proliferation at div <dig> recapitulates early pp <dig> phenotype
to test our hypothesis that reduced sc proliferation disrupts axonal sc colonization, we blocked sc proliferation at div <dig> by treatment with aphidicolin, a dna polymerase inhibitor  <cit> ,  and analyzed sc migration. in controls as well as after aphidicolin treatment axonal growth was observed . however, hardly any sc were detectable that migrated out of the explant along the axons after sc proliferation was inhibited . only occasional cells can be observed along the elongated axons . in addition to blocked proliferation, we also noticed nuclear debris  in controls and aphidicolin treated explants. cells either died along axons or the detritus was pushed away from the explants during axonal growth. the almost total lack of sc after blockade of sc proliferation at div <dig> suggests that a certain amount of sc is required to initiate migration.

gdnf is dispensable for sc migration along sympathetic axons
next we directly addressed the role of gdnf for sc migration along sympathetic axons by using scg explants from gdnf knock out  mice  <cit> . to rule out possible gdnf-contamination of the 3d collagen  matrix based migration assay we performed a western blot analyzing various amounts of rat-tail collagen. as positive controls commercially available murine gdnf and protein samples from rat adrenal gland, rat cerebrum as well as pc <dig> cells were used. while gdnf monomers were readily detected in the rat adrenal gland and rat cerebrum, no gdnf signals were detectable in any of the collagen dilutions .

having demonstrated that collagen gels are free of gdnf, we took advantage of the migration assay and analyzed gdnf- deficient scg explants in comparison to controls. in gdnf ko as well as control scg explants a multitude of sympathetic axons were observed growing from the explanted ganglia visible in bright field as well as after th-immunohistochemistry . this indicates that the overall axonal growth is not affected by the loss of gdnf in scg explants. unexpectedly however, also many s <dig> positive cells were observed associated with the axons in both control as well as gdnf mutant explants in proximal and also more distal axonal areas. in addition time-lapse movies  demonstrae unaltered axonal growth and normally migrating sc along elongating axons in both control and gdnf mutant explants. together, these data demonstrate that gdnf is not required for sc migration along sympathetic axons.

gdnf is also dispensable for sc colonization of the sciatic nerve
next we addressed in whether gdnf affects sc colonization of other peripheral nerves. to this end we examined orthogonal semi-thin sections of gdnf/tgfb <dig> double mutant sciatic nerves and controls at e <dig> . due to perinatal death of the gdnf mutant mice the analyses are restricted to embryonic stages  <cit> . it was previously shown that tgfb facilitates gdnf signaling by recruiting gfra <dig> to plasma membranes  <cit> . this makes the tgfb2/gdnf double mutant a good model to study gdnf function. however, no differences were observed between the control and the double mutant sciatic nerves . in both cases a multitude of sc can be observed in the orthogonal sectioned nerve . this demonstrates that, at least during embryonic stages, gdnf is dispensable for sc migration in peripheral nerves.

discussion
sc are a fundamental component of peripheral nerves and either solely ensheath or additionally myelinate axons. by both, sc support the long-term integrity of axons with the latter also rapid impulse propagation  <cit> . sc development, including proliferation, survival, migration and myelination is regulated by axonal signals  <cit> . many studies have addressed the molecular processes that control sc development and disease, however most of these focused on myelination . less is known about the signals that regulate sc colonization of axons following the migration of sc precursors from the neural crest to nerve trunks  <cit> . gdnf was previously observed to promote migration of immortalized sc precursors and primary sciatic nerve sc  <cit> . sc express gfra <dig> the gdnf binding receptor  <cit>  in line with the hypothesis that gdnf can directly signal to sc. to test the role of gdnf for sc migration along sympathetic axons we used a sc migration assay, containing elongating axons, the physiological substrate for sc precursor migration  <cit> , a compound chemical inhibitor  for src as well as ret kinases, signaling cascade components of non-canonical and canonical gdnf signaling respectively, and scg explants of embryonic gdnf ko mice  <cit>  in combination with time lapse imaging.

application of pp <dig> at div <dig> inhibited axonal sc colonization, so only bare axons were visible during time-lapse imaging. further analyzes however, focusing on sc which were already migrating along growing axons  showed that pp <dig> only had a mild and insignificant effect on sc migration distances. however, pp <dig> was observed to reduce sc proliferation and increase sc apoptosis. by blocking sc proliferation  at div <dig> we were also able to sufficiently block axonal sc colonization. we therefore concluded that pp <dig>  if applied at div <dig>  indirectly inhibited axonal sc colonization, by reducing the number of sc precursors. though, even if the phenotype induced by pp <dig> at div <dig> was caused indirectly it was severe and could eventually support the hypothesis that gdnf is crucial for axonal sc colonization. importantly however, in contrast to our expectations, we found no obvious sc migration phenotype, analyzing scg explants of gdnf null embryos in comparison to controls. accordingly, we had to conclude that gdnf signaling is neither absolutely required for the proliferation of premigratory sc nor for their subsequent migration along sympathetic axons. the absence of obvious defects in sc development also indicates that gdnf- mediated axonal release of heparin-binding forms of nrg <dig> as observed for cultured drg neurons  <cit>  is not essential for the development of sc in the sympathetic nervous system or is compensated by the in excess available ngf, which is also able to release heparin binding forms of nrg <dig>  <cit> . the different outcomes of our study and the previous findings could result from different model systems used, e.g. that gdnf may serve distinct functions in myelinated and nonmyelinated nerves. however, nonmyelinating sc have been shown to respond to  gdnf, which stimulates sc proliferation and myelination of small caliber axons in adult rats  <cit> . finally we wanted to address the in vivo role of gdnf for sc migration. as gdnf ko mice are not viable  <cit> , analyzes were restricted to embryonic stages in which the dissection of postganglionic scg nerves is hardly feasible. therefore we decided to analyze late embryonic  sciatic nerves of gdnf mutants in comparison to controls. in line with our previous results in the sympathetic nervous system also in the sciatic nerve of gdnf  mutants in comparison to controls no difference with respect to sc populations could be observed. this indicates that gdnf is dispensable for embryonic sc migration in vivo. even though endogenous gdnf is dispensable for normal sc development it cannot be ruled out that exogenously introduced gdnf is able to affect sc migration, which could explain previous findings . alternatively, other gdnf family ligands  may compensate for the loss of gdnf in scg explant cultures and in sciatic nerves in vivo. normal sc development in gdnf deficient scg explants in contrast to massively reduced sc proliferation after pp <dig> application indicates that src and/ or ret kinase activities in scg explants are regulated by additional extracellular signals. nrg <dig> signaling regulates sc proliferation  <cit> , and we have recently shown that nrg <dig> type iii-erbb signaling promotes sc colonization of distal sympathetic regions by preventing apoptosis in proximal regions  <cit> . since nrg <dig> signaling also stimulates src kinase activity  <cit> , it is plausible that src inactivation by pp <dig> mimics to some extend the loss of nrg <dig> type iii erbb signaling. though, it is interesting to note that blocking erbb receptors leads next to reduced sc proliferation also to reduced sc colonization of distal axonal compartments  <cit> , together indicating a more complex erbb downstream signaling. taken together we demonstrate that sc can migrate along sympathetic axons an sciatic nerve axons of gdnf deficient embryos leading to the conclusion that gdnf as a factor and also gdnf signaling is dispensable for sc migration along murine embryonic axons.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we analyzed the role of gdnf for embryonic sc migration. in contrast to previous in vitro findings in the sciatic nerve and a sc precursor cell line  <cit> , our data clearly indicate, that gdnf is dispensable for embryonic sc migration along sympathetic axons, demonstrated with the scg explant sc development assay, as well as along the sciatic nerve, demonstrated with the help of semithin sections of mutant nerves. although pp <dig>  a pharmacological inhibitor for canonical as well as alternative gdnf signaling, showed a strong effect on axonal sc colonization , this effect is in fact independent of gdnf. this is clearly shown, as no phenotype could be observed when gdnf mutant scgs were used for the scg explant sc migration assay . further investigations revealed that pp <dig> acts rather on sc proliferation and on sc survival than on sc migration directly . sc motility, was only affected by trend shown in the quantitative analysis  as well as in the additional file 3: movie s3/additional file 4: movie s <dig>  these data suggest that sc proliferation is a prerequisite for the initiation of sc migration, underlined by the fact that early blockade of sc proliferaion also prevented axonal sc colonization . the phenotype induced by pp <dig>  however, must be the result of an alteration of a different signaling pathway. as neuregulin1/erbb signaling can also act via a src kinase  <cit>  and was shown to be involved in sc proliferation  <cit>  we conclude that pp <dig> is interfering with this pathway. altogether we demonstrated that sc can migrate along axons in the absence of gdnf signaling.
