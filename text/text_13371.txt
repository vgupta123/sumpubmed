BACKGROUND
the g protein-coupled receptor  gene superfamily consists of hundreds of members that are widely expressed in all tissues and serve as receptors for a diverse complement of ligands. approximately  <dig> of these receptors are considered orphan gpcrs, in that no endogenous ligand has been confirmed for them  <cit> . characterized by having seven transmembrane alpha-helical domains  <cit> , gpcrs mediate a wide spectrum of cellular processes ranging from cell growth to neurotransmission  <cit> . a number of classification systems for gpcrs have been developed as bioinformatic tools <cit> . one of the most commonly used gpcr classification systems, the one set forth by kolakowski and developed by vriend  <cit> , groups gpcrs into six classes based on structural similarities to prototypical receptors. class a gpcrs are the most abundant , defined by a high sequence homology to rhodopsin, and include the chemosensory receptors. class b gpcrs are also known as secretin-like receptors. class c gpcrs are the metabotropic glutamate-like receptors. class f/s receptors consist of frizzled/smoothened receptors, though there is debate about their ability to couple to g proteins  <cit> . class d/fungal pheromone and class e/camp receptors are absent in mammals.

on activation via ligand binding, gpcrs couple to heterotrimeric g proteins composed of three subunits: gα, β and γ. g protein α subunits are classified as members of one of four groups: gi/o, gs, gq, and g12/ <dig>  <cit> . each subunit couples to specific cellular protein targets  through which cellular activity is modulated. the gβ/γ g protein subunits are capable of acting at their own specific targets, such as modulating ion channel activity  <cit> . the available complement of heterotrimeric g proteins will therefore affect its response profile.

a regulatory system controls the timing and duration of gpcr signaling. gpcr kinases  phosphorylate agonist-occupied receptors, typically leading to receptor desensitization. beta-arrestins are scaffolding proteins that are recruited to activated gpcrs and prevent g protein association with the receptor. they also serve to spatially segregate gpcr signaling to molecules such as mitogen-activated protein kinases  <cit> . the regulators of g protein signaling  proteins, which enhance the gtpase activity of gα subunits, is another large family of proteins important in fine-tuning gpcr signaling  <cit> .

due to their central roles in many cellular functions, gpcrs are important therapeutic targets. different reports estimate that between  <dig> and 50% of all prescription drugs target gpcrs. interestingly, these drugs only target ~10% of the non-chemosensory receptors, leaving hundreds of gpcrs as potential drug targets  <cit> .

identifying ligands, studying receptor protein interactions, and measuring cellular effects of receptor activation is often achieved by heterologous expression of gpcrs in cell lines such as hek <dig> and att <dig>  <cit> . they also serve as models of cell types from which they are drawn   <cit> . however these cell lines have remained something of a black box; researchers make use of them without full knowledge of the complement of gpcrs and related proteins. the presence of an unknown protein in these cell lines may confound an otherwise sound series of experiments and differential expression of gpcrs and their regulatory proteins may explain differences in reported results across cell lines  <cit> . it is also clear that gpcrs can form oligomers with other gpcrs. these oligomers may confer different signaling properties to a transfected gpcr of interest, and can add layers of variability and complexity.

efforts to define expression of gpcrs, on a receptor-by-receptor basis, using polymerase chain reaction -based methods have only scratched the surface. even for the widely used hek <dig> cells, the expression of fewer than thirty gpcrs has been described  <cit> . recently developed high-throughput methods have made possible the simultaneous assay of mrna levels for thousands of genes. microarray analyses have matured sufficiently in terms of accessibility and cost to make their application to this question tractable. we are not the first to make use of microarray technology to examine mrna expression levels in hek <dig> cells  <cit> , however, most studies that have used microarray analyses on these cell lines have examined specific gene products of interest and reported data only for those gene products  <cit> . their full data sets are available through ncbi, but are difficult for the non-specialist user to access and collate.

as a consequence, we sought to identify and make accessible the full complement of endogenously expressed non-chemosensory gpcrs of four cell lines used in gpcr research: the hek <dig>  att <dig>  bv <dig> and n <dig> lines. using microarray analysis we measured the mrna levels from each of these four cell lines specifically identifying the expression levels of gpcrs and over a hundred of gpcr-related gene products and report them here.

RESULTS
we first examined hek <dig> cells, a cell line that was made by transforming human embryonic kidney cells with adenovirus type  <dig> dna. developed in  <dig>  hek <dig> cells may be the single most widely used cell line for heterologous expression  of gpcrs and other proteins of interest  <cit> . figures  <dig> , <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> show the mrna levels of gpcr and gpcr-related gene products found in hek <dig> cells. of class a gpcrs, shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  hek <dig> cells express mrna for several different types of receptors within specific families of receptors: multiple types of adenosine, lysophospholipid, purinergic, prostanoid, and protease-activated receptors, among others. in results relevant to the study of orphan gpcrs , hek <dig> cells contain high message levels of gpr <dig>   <dig> types of orphan-lgr  receptors--lgr <dig> and lgr <dig>  gpr39--and very high levels of the melatonin-related receptor gpr <dig>  hek <dig> cells may therefore be suitable tools for deorphanization of these receptors. interestingly, hek <dig> cells contain relatively little mrna for class b gpcrs with known ligands , but quite high levels of many orphan class b gpcrs. the same is true for class c gpcrs as seen in figure 4b though they do appear to contain high levels of gababr <dig> receptor message, though lacking mrna for gababr <dig>  necessary to form a fully functional gaba-b receptor. finally, for gpcrs, hek <dig> cells contain a number of types of frizzled receptors as well as smoothened receptor . figures  <dig> and  <dig> show the mrna levels of various types of gpcr signaling-related gene products such as the g proteins and a number of their targets and downstream effectors as well as proteins that regulate gpcr signaling, the grk, beta-arrestin  and rgs proteins. interestingly hek <dig> cells express mrna for numerous isoforms of adenylyl cyclase and protein kinases a and c  and phospholipase c , while having a limited diversity of phospholipase a  and rgs proteins. hek <dig> cells also appear to have an almost full complement of g protein isoforms for each subunit, making these cells an attractive environment to express any number of gpcrs to study downstream g protein-mediated signaling.

next we analyzed the att <dig> cell line, a neuroendocrine line derived from a mouse pituitary tumor that has neuron-like properties  <cit> . this cell line is often used as a model neuroendocrine cell line and has been a useful cell line to study of ion channel modulation by gpcrs  <cit> . unlike hek <dig> cells, there has been relatively little work performed to identify the gpcrs and related signaling molecules present in att <dig> cells. our current results highlight that att <dig> cells express a diverse range of gpcr mrnas. figures  <dig> and  <dig> show that they possess a number of types of class a receptors with a few isoforms of each type. according to our analysis here, they express a few different isoforms of adenosine, chemokine, dopamine, neuropeptide ff, prostanoid and somatostatin receptors with a number of other individual members from other types. figure  <dig> shows that att <dig> cells have a limited breadth of class a orphan gpcrs. in class b, att <dig> cells express mrna for a number of glucagon, orphan brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor , and orphan latrophilin receptors . like hek <dig> cells, att <dig> cells express mrna for gababr <dig> , but unlike hek293s they express several metabotropic glutamate receptor genes . for class f/s in att20s we detected mrna for six frizzled receptors but not smoothened receptor mrna . att20's have a somewhat sparser repertoire of gpcr signaling-related gene products than hek293s, especially within the g protein subunits .

we next examined bv <dig> cells, a cell line that is often used as a model system for the study of microglial function  <cit> . as shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  bv <dig> cells predominately possess mrna for anaphylatoxin, chemokine, and prostanoid class a gpcrs as would be expected from an immune system-derived cell line. they also express mrna for a scattering of other receptor types, such as a few muscarinic, somatostatin, and lipid receptors, among others. as has been reported in the literature, bv <dig> cells express cb <dig> cannabinoid receptors   <cit> , which makes them unique among the other cell lines examined here. we also observed the expression of a large number of different class a orphan gpcr mrnas as seen in figure  <dig>  though a much less diverse repertoire of orphans from class b  or class c  receptors were present. bv <dig> cells express only one class c gpcr at a significant, albeit, low mrna level: the metabotropic glutamate receptor, mglur <dig> . figure 4c shows that bv <dig> cells possess mrna for a few different types of frizzled receptors as well as the smoothened receptor. bv <dig> cells have a wide complement of gpcr signaling-related gene products . though not quite as extensive as hek <dig> cells, bv <dig> cells possess numerous isoforms of different phospholipases, pka, pkc, and adenylyl cyclase. their beta-arrestin, rgs protein, and grk levels suggest the capacity to highly regulate gpcr signaling as well.

lastly we investigated the n <dig> cell line. this cell line is derived from a neuroblastoma and is commonly employed as a neuron-like cell line. it has been used as a tool to analyze ion channel function in response to toxins and other regulators  <cit> . we found that n <dig> cells have mrna for a broad range of different class a gpcrs as seen in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  n <dig> cells have mrna for a few types of muscarinic acetylcholine, adenosine, chemokine, neuropeptides, prostanoids, protease-activated, and somatostatin receptors with a few other individual types such as cb <dig> cannabinoid receptors . like the bv <dig> cells, n <dig> cells have mrna for quite a few class a orphan gpcrs  with a similar profile as well. they further express mrna for a broad complement of class b gpcrs  but express a limited profile of class c gpcrs . they also have mrna for a number of different types of frizzled receptors, but lack mrna for a smoothened receptor . n <dig> cells express high levels of many of the gpcr signaling-related gene products. they have abundant levels of g proteins and numerous isoforms of pka. n <dig> cells' gpcrs are also presumably tightly regulated based on the assortment of grk, rgs and beta-arrestin mrnas detected .

in order to validate our findings with the microarray analyses, we performed quantitative real-time pcr  analysis on these four cell lines. we chose a range of gpcrs, mostly orphan receptors , as well as two phospholipases  as candidates to measure their mrna levels using this alternative method. we selected genes that had distinct and differential expression profiles across the four cell lines. the data are plotted in figure  <dig> in a manner that correlates the copy number of mrnas measured in each cell line using qpcr with the levels of mrna determined from our microarray experiments. the qpcr data were broadly consistent with our microarray data. we observed higher copy numbers for all genes for which we had observed statistically significant microarray expression, suggesting an overall good correlation between our microarray and qpcr data. the qpcr did detect mrna for a few genes whose levels of expression did not reach statistical significance in the microarray analyses. these genes are plcb <dig>  gpr <dig>  and gpr <dig> in att <dig> cells and plcb <dig>  gpr <dig> and gpr <dig> in n <dig> cells.

discussion
the ability to induce expression of a known protein in a model cellular system, such as the cell lines analyzed here, has served as a remarkable, vital tool. however, the gpcr research community that makes use of these cell lines has had only limited data on the complement of gpcrs and related signaling machinery expressed in them. when a cell line is used for heterologous expression, ignorance of the endogenous protein expression profile of a cell line may lead to false conclusions about the nature of receptor function. indeed, the cellular milieu can have a dramatic impact on gpcr signaling . we expanded upon this knowledge by demonstrating that hek <dig> cells express at least  <dig> different gpcr mrnas. much of what has been reported about gpcr mrna expression patterns in hek <dig> cells was confirmed by our analysis: adora2b, chrm <dig>  f2r, f2rl <dig>  gababr <dig>  gpcr5a, gpr <dig>  lgr <dig>  lpar <dig>  lpar <dig>  p2yr <dig>  ptger <dig>  s1pr, and sstr <dig>  <cit> . hek <dig> cells have been reported to possess mrna for a number of receptors that were not found to be expressed at statistically significant levels in our study: 5ht1d, 5ht <dig>  5ht <dig>  adra <dig>  adrab <dig>  agtr <dig>  bdkrb <dig>  drd <dig>  gpr <dig>  gpr <dig>  grm <dig>  p2yr <dig> and sstr <dig>  <cit> . our results also indicate that hek <dig> cells express mrna for most g protein subunit isoforms, and numerous isoforms of adenylyl cyclase, protein kinases a and c, and phospholipase c. in addition they are useful for studying regulation of g protein mediated signaling as significant levels of mrna for beta-arrestin <dig> and  <dig>  grk3- <dig> and a number of rgs subtypes were seen.

much less is known of the expression patterns of gpcrs in att <dig> cells. we confirmed the presence of sstr <dig> and sstr <dig> mrna in att <dig> cells  <cit> , but did not observe significant levels of any of the other receptors that have previously been reported such as chrm <dig>  <cit> , vipr1a, adcyap1r <dig>  or sstr <dig>  <cit> . the lack of significant levels of crf receptor mrna was of interest as att <dig> cells have been reported to be sensitive to crf  <cit> . mrna for hrh <dig> or hrh <dig> histamine receptors were not detectable, despite reports of their presence  <cit> , but a low level of hrh <dig> was found. tacr <dig>  <cit>  was not detected, nor were tacr <dig> and tacr <dig>  we also did not detect the orphan cmkor1/cxcr <dig>  <cit> . it is worth noting that there are at least two att <dig> clones available and this may explain some of the differences we found. generally speaking, att <dig> cells possess a much less diverse complement of gpcr-related signaling and regulatory gene products than the other cell lines tested. of the approximately  <dig> gpcr signaling gene products that we studied here, att <dig> cells had  <dig> significantly expressed signaling related proteins compared to  <dig> or more in each of the  <dig> other cell lines. att <dig> cells were the only ones to not have significant levels of beta-arrestin <dig>  or grk3- <dig>  only three rgs gene products were found at significantly high levels: rgs <dig>  rgs <dig>  and snx <dig> 

bv <dig> cells are commonly used to study microglial biology. these cells exist in a continuum between two states: a resting state and an activated state. for example, upon interferon gamma treatment , bv <dig> cells increase both cnr <dig> and gpr <dig> mrna levels, whereas with lipopolysaccharide treatment  these levels decrease  <cit> . in our case, bv <dig> cells were cultured under conditions expected to promote a resting state. we can confirm that as reported in the literature bv <dig> cells express adora <dig>  <cit> , cnr <dig>  <cit> , mtnr1a  <cit> , galr <dig>  <cit> , ccr <dig>  cxcr <dig>  <cit>  and rgs <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  <cit> . we also detected mrna for receptors that have been reported to be upregulated in response to stimulation such as ccrl <dig>  <cit> , ptafr, ptigr  <cit>  and rgs <dig>  <cit> . here, too, we identified a few receptors that have been reported present for which we found levels of mrna below the levels that we defined as statistically significant: hcrtr <dig>  <cit> , gpr <dig>  <cit>  and the receptor for cx3cr <dig>  <cit> . we did not detect prokr <dig> which is upregulated with activation  <cit> , nor for oprm <dig>  p2ry <dig> and gpr <dig> which are downregulated following activation  <cit> . several reports have identified the presence of mglurs in bv <dig> and primary microglia  <cit> . interestingly, grm <dig> is generally thought not to be present in bv <dig> cells, yet it was the only one that we significantly detected. we did find low, non-significant levels of grm <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the differences may be due to differences in the activation state of the cell lines. bv <dig> cells appear have a diverse receptor and signaling gene product profile.

of the cell lines tested, the least well characterized is the n <dig> neuroblastoma line. they are known to express cnr <dig>  <cit> , which we confirmed with our analysis. it has been reported by some that they do not express muscarinic receptors  <cit> , but our analysis shows that they have mrna for three different types  consistent with other reports  <cit> . these studies also found evidence for secretin, prostacyclin, opioid and alpha2-adrenergic receptors in support of this we found significantly high levels of mrna for ptgir <dig>  ptger <dig>  ptger <dig>  ptger <dig>  oprd <dig>  oprl <dig> and adra2b. there were also levels of mrna for sctr, adra2a, oprk <dig> and oprm <dig> that did not reach statistical significance. another report describes p2ry <dig> expression  <cit> , but for this we only found low non-significant levels. beyond these reports there seems to be little known of gpcr signaling in this cell line and this analysis substantially extends our knowledge of its complement of gpcr expression, at least at the mrna level. like bv <dig> cells, n <dig> cells appear to have a large repertoire of gpcrs, effectors, and regulating proteins, being consistently one of the highest expressers in each receptor class analyzed.

interestingly, even the most prolific cell line expressed only a small portion of the full repertoire of non-chemosensory gpcrs . of these four cell types, bv <dig> cells expressed the highest total number of gpcrs  followed by n <dig> , att <dig> , and hek <dig> cells . bv <dig> cells had the greatest total abundance of class a receptors , but had equal numbers of class a orphan gpcrs as n <dig> cells . on the other hand, hek <dig> cells have mrna for the greater number of class b and class c orphans . it is interesting that the bv <dig> and the n <dig> cell lines, which are more often used as models for specific cell types, express mrna for the most diverse set of receptors. this presumably results in a greater sensitivity to a broad spectrum of ligands and the large number of signaling proteins for which we measured high mrna levels in these two cell lines attest to this. it is also of interest that hek <dig> and att <dig> cells have the lowest numbers of gpcrs of these four lines. low expression  may allow these cell lines to serve as a better-differentiated cell model, and, from an experimental perspective, may make a given cell line more attractive as a 'clean slate' into which gene products of interest can be introduced.

mrna expression levels do not guarantee that a specific mrna is properly translated, folded, and trafficked to produce functional protein. discrepancies between our findings and those that have been reported using pcr-based methods may be due to differences that appear in cell lines with time, passage number and growth conditions. discrepancies may also be attributed to the pcr-based techniques generally employed to extract and amplify mrna: in some cases the techniques used in many of the studies cited here, some of which do not allow for relative quantification, may have detected very low levels of receptor mrna that did not reach our threshold for statistical significance. in light of the potential discrepancies between microarray and pcr-based techniques, we employed qpcr analysis to test the validity of our microarray results . the overall consistency between our qpcr results and microarray data lend confidence to the concept that the microarray analyses accurately reflect the presence of mrna for these gpcrs and their signaling proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this microarray analysis of the nearly full complement of non-chemosensory gpcrs and related signaling proteins in these four cell lines greatly expands our understanding of their potential signaling repertoire. these cell lines are used frequently as models of specific cell types, in heterologous expression, and as controls for antibody screening. the present work provides accessible profiles of mrna expression that we hope will assist investigators of the gpcr superfamily in choosing the appropriate cell line to study a particular gpcr or related protein of interest and further to better understand potential functional interactions between gpcrs and related proteins in these lines. it is our hope that this work can eventually be extended to other commonly used cell lines such as cho and cos <dig> cells when their host genomes  have been sequenced and made available for gene microarray analysis.
