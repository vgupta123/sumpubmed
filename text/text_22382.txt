BACKGROUND
folate  is an essential nutrient required for the de novo synthesis of deoxythymidine monophosphate  and s-adenosylmethionine  through one-carbon metabolism and methionine cycle, respectively . dtmp is then converted into the triphosphate form , which is required for the synthesis of dna, while adomet is pivotal in a number of metabolic pathways, including the biosynthesis of polyamines , and intracellular methylation reactions that involve dna, rna and proteins, including histones .

dietary manipulation of folate has been referred to as a 'double edge sword' because pharmacological depletion of folate by antifolate drugs prevents cancer cell proliferation but might induce genetic and epigenetic damage and consequent transformation in non-cancerous cells. conversely, folate supplementation might prevent transformation but sustain the high proliferation rates characteristic of cancer tissue  <cit> . epidemiological studies associating dietary intake of folate with the incidence of different cancer types are often conflicting likely reflecting this apparent paradox  <cit> . molecular studies, both in vitro and in vivo, suggest that indeed the effects of folate depletion might depend on the cell type  <cit>  and on the cellular stage of transformation  <cit> . strikingly, dietary folate depletion, alone or combined with a low methyl diet, induced tumorigenesis of liver and colon in rodents  <cit> .

based on seminal data from multiple laboratories it was hypothesized that the mechanism of carcinogenesis induced by folate depletion might include both genetic damage consequent to altered availability of dttp, and epigenetic damage consequent to altered levels of adomet  <cit> . decreased biosynthesis of dtmp, reflected by an increase of dutp , leads to uracil misincorporation into the dna, which is expected to culminate in futile cycles of uracil excision, single strand breaks and possibly chromosomal breakage  <cit> . epigenetic damage consequent to folate depletion is a more controversial topic, as altered levels of adomet and s-adenosylhomocysteine  together with changes in the global levels of dna methylation are not consistently found in different cell types  <cit> . also, altered cpg island methylation was found in the promoter of p <dig> and p <dig> of rodents fed a folate/methyl deficient diet  <cit>  raising the possibility that folate depletion might have a global effect on cpg island methylation.

we recently demonstrated that one of the factors affecting cellular sensitivity to folate depletion is the rate of polyamine biosynthesis , which draws on adomet pools  <cit>  . polyamines are ubiquitous molecules essential for cellular life whose intracellular concentration is tightly regulated and maintained in the millimolar range in all cell types  <cit> . nonetheless, polyamine biosynthesis is characteristically high in certain tissues including prostate, which, in addition to synthesizing polyamines for epithelial cell replacement, secretes massive amounts of polyamines in the prostatic fluid. interestingly, a recent clinical trial designed to study the effects of dietary folate supplementation on the prevention of colorectal adenomas reported as the most significant result a five time increase in prostate cancer incidence  <cit> . this finding supports the idea that prostate cells, whose response to folate depletion was never studied before, might be highly dependent on folate in order to sustain their proliferation and, therefore, might be exquisitely sensitive to folate depletion. thus, we hypothesized that prostate cells might be exquisitely sensitive to genetic, epigenetic and phenotypic changes consequent to folate depletion.

we present a study that, for the first time, simultaneously investigates several aspects characteristic of the molecular, genetic, epigenetic and cellular response to folate depletion in a model comprised of three syngenic prostate cell lines derived from the transgenic adenoma of the mouse prostate  mouse model recapitulating the different stages of prostate cancer - benign, transformed and metastatic - in order to address the possibility that different stages of transformation might alter the response to folate depletion. indeed, it was previously shown that the effects of mild folate depletion on both the methionine pathway and the methylation status differ among transformed and untransformed human colon cell lines  <cit> . our study, using three syngenic but phenotypically distinct cell lines, addresses this possibility.

we report that prostate cells suffer genetic and epigenetic instability along with changes in cell phenotype, even in the presence of levels of folate , that allow for the undisturbed growth of other cell types known to be sensitive to more severe folate depletion. specifically, we demonstrate for the first time that long-term , mild folate depletion alone is sufficient to induce chromosomal rearrangements and cpg island hypermethylation changes in prostate cells. the analysis of cellular response to mild folate depletion, integrating one-carbon metabolism, methionine cycle and polyamine biosynthesis, with genetic and epigenetic damage, and consequent phenotypical changes in three distinct prostate cell lines, helps to clarify the interplay and contribution of each of these pathways to carcinogenesis consequent to folate depletion. these findings provide a strong rationale for studying the effects of dietary manipulation of folate intake on the prostate in vivo.

RESULTS
chronic mild folate depletion affects prostate cells' phenotype
we grew three syngenic, but phenotypically distinct, clonal cell lines; c-2d , c-2g  and c-2h , which were generated from a primary prostate tumour in a tramp mouse  <cit> , in folate-restricted  medium for  <dig> pd and refer to these cells as d <dig>  g <dig>  and h <dig>  respectively. in parallel, we grew the cells for  <dig> pd with the supraphysiological levels of folic acid  routinely used in tissue culture and refer to these cells as dctrl, gctrl and hctrl. as expected, d <dig>  g <dig> and h <dig> were significantly depleted of folate . the intracellular content of folate ranged between  <dig> and  <dig> ng/ <dig> million cells for dctrl, gctrl and hctrl but was < <dig> ng/ <dig> million cells for d <dig>  g <dig> and h <dig>  we have previously demonstrated that, although colon cancer cell lines grow normally at  <dig> nm folic acid , prostate cancer cell lines, due to their high polyamine production, slow their growth to varying degrees with this level of fa in the medium  <cit> . in order to investigate for any permanent phenotypical change that folate depletion might have induced in the three cell lines we put them back into control medium for  <dig> pd and tested them for their proliferation rates, anchorage independent growth ability and sensitivity to folate depletion.

g <dig>  but not d <dig> and h <dig>  slightly increased their proliferation rate compared to their respective controls, as they decreased their population doubling time from  <dig>  h to  <dig> h . all three cell lines grown for  <dig> pd in low folate medium significantly increased their ability to form anchorage independent colonies in soft agar over their respective controls . dctrl, which is derived from the untransformed cell line c-2d, could only form sporadic colonies in soft agar . growth in low folate for  <dig> pd slightly, but significantly , increased the number of d <dig> cells capable of anchorage independent growth in soft agar . folate depletion had a more dramatic effect on 2g and 2h cells, where the number of colonies per field increased from two for gctrl to  <dig> for g <dig> and from  <dig> for hctrl to  <dig> for h <dig> .

interestingly, all cells grown with restricted amounts of folate also significantly  decreased their sensitivity to folate depletion as we established by assessing folate-dependent growth curves on all six cell lines . all three cell lines that had been grown for 20pd in low folate conditions demonstrated nearly 100% growth at  <dig> nm fa , while the dctrl, gctrl, and hctrl versions of the cell lines only grow to 80%, 19% and 60% . as expected, the total polyamine production was not significantly affected by growth in low folate , confirming that maintaining polyamine pools might be a priority in prostate cells, thereby further increasing the stress on adomet pools in a folate depleted state . nonetheless, we found that the spermidine to spermine ratio , which correlates with cancer cells' aggressiveness and proliferation rates in several cell types in vivo  <cit>  , was increased in g <dig> and h <dig> as compared to control cells .

chronic mild folate depletion induces dna damage in prostate cells in vitro
analysis of nucleotide pools by high pressure liquid chromatography  identified significantly increased intracellular dutp levels in d <dig>  g <dig> and h <dig>  up to 166%, 388% and 244% of dctrl, gctrl and hctrl, respectively . surprisingly, dttp was not decreased in any of the three cell lines upon mild folate depletion. dttp was, in fact, unchanged in both d <dig> and h <dig> and increased to 136% in g <dig> as compared to gctrl . nonetheless, due to the dutp increase, the dutp:dttp ratio was significantly increased in all three cell lines to 155%, 285% and 229% of their respective controls . in order to determine if the increased dutp:dttp ratio led to increased uracil misincorporation into the dna we analysed the cells' dna by random oligo-primed synthesis   <cit>  and detected significant uracil misincorporation in all three cell lines  and increased amount of dna single strand breaks in d <dig> and h <dig> .

in order to investigate if these static measures of increased uracil misincorporation and single strand dna breaks were associated with accumulation of chromosomal rearrangements we analysed g <dig> and gctrl cells by spectral karyotype analysis   <cit> . we found that g <dig> and gctrl shared five marker chromosomes in common, which were seen in greater than 15% of metaphases studied . as shown in table  <dig>  g <dig> cells exhibited five additional marker chromosomes seen in 24% - 37% of cells, which were never seen in any of  <dig> metaphase cells in gctrl. a representative metaphase cell from each cell line is shown in figure 3c demonstrating four of the common marker chromosomes in gctrl and four of the new marker chromosomes in the g <dig> cell line . looking at only the marker chromosomes present in both cell lines , we observed eight different patterns of these marker chromosomes in two or more cells in gctrl and seven different patterns in g <dig>  indicating significant cellular heterogeneity is retained in the g <dig> cells. figure 3d shows the frequency distribution of the various patterns  of these five marker chromosomes in both cell lines. two novel patterns, i and j, were seen in the g <dig> cell line, while three relatively rare patterns  from the gctrl line were not observed in g <dig>  these data do not support the hypothesis that clonal selection occurred in the g <dig> cell line. furthermore, once the five novel marker chromosomes seen in g <dig> are taken into consideration, it is clear that there is increased, rather than decreased heterogeneity in the g <dig> cell line.

chronic mild folate depletion affects adomet pools
we measured adomet and adohcy by hplc in the three cell lines grown with or without mild folate depletion, as shown in figure 4a. adomet levels in d <dig> were reduced to 84% of those found in dctrl cells. conversely, adomet was increased upon folate depletion in g <dig> and h <dig>  where it was 131% and 132% of gctrl and hctrl, respectively. as a consequence of folate depletion, adohcy was increased in all cell lines as it reached 295%, 186% and 111% of levels detected in dctrl, gctrl, and hctrl, respectively . the adomet:adohcy ratio upon mild folate depletion was consequently decreased in d <dig> and g <dig>  and increased in h <dig> . regardless of the changes observed in the adomet:adohcy ratio, we found no significant change in the total levels of 5-methylcytosine in the genome of d <dig>  g <dig> and h <dig> compared to their respective controls as measured by liquid chromatography paired to mass spectrometry   <cit> .

increased cpg island methylation and histone hypermethylation
folate depletion has been associated with de novo cpg methylation of candidate genes in colon and liver in vivo  <cit> . in order to determine if mild folate depletion induced global cpg island hypermethylation in the prostate cell lines, we measured cpg island methylation by restriction landmark genomic scanning ; a global approach that allows for the simultaneous screening of the methylation status of over  <dig> distinct cpg islands in the genome. each spot is named according to a coordinate naming system as previously described  <cit>  and the sequence represented by approximately half of the spots has been identified  <cit> . comparing the three cell lines grown in  <dig> nm fa to the same cells grown in control medium we identified  <dig> hypermethylated loci, as defined by rlgs spot loss  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  three rlgs spot methylation events were found in two of the three cell lines. for eight of the rlgs loci, the sequences represented by the spot are known .

*met indicates methylation of the noti site represented by the rlgs spot.

similar to what was observed for changes in cell phenotype and uracil misincorporation, g <dig> had the most dramatic change in methylation pattern with  <dig> hypermethylated loci, followed by h <dig> with three and d <dig> with one. figure 4c shows representative regions of the rlgs gels for each cell line demonstrating methylation of two rlgs spots . note that spot 4d <dig>  corresponding to a cpg island 5' to the argef <dig> gene, shows greatly reduced intensity  in both d <dig> and g <dig> cells compared to control , while the spot 4g <dig>  corresponding to a cpg island 5' to the gm <dig> gene, displayed decreased intensity in both g <dig> and h <dig> cells .

in order to confirm that the decrease in spot intensity identified by rlgs corresponded to an actual increase of dna methylation in the corresponding cpg islands, we utilized the sequenom platform for quantitative bisulfite sequencing of the eight identified rlgs spots. mass array quantitative methylation analysis  confirmed all the rlgs spot methylation events listed in table  <dig>  figure 4d shows the hypermethylation of 4d <dig> in d <dig> and g <dig>  but not h <dig>  compared to the control cell lines.

in order to determine if mild folate depletion induced any change in the global levels of histone methylation in prostate cells like it was reported in other cell types  <cit> , we assessed global methylation levels at key residues of histone h <dig>  in the g <dig> and gctrl cell lines. using western blot analysis of histones we measured h <dig> lysine  <dig>  methylation, which is well characterized and known to associate with a repressive transcriptional status and cpg island hypermethylation. we found that mono-, di- and tri-methylation were all increased at h3k <dig> in g <dig> cells . in order to understand if the increase in histone methylation was specific to transcriptionally repressive histone modifications we analysed the levels of histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> di-methylation , as this modification is known to associate with the body of transcriptionally active genes. we found that h3k36me <dig> was also increased in cells grown with mild folate depletion. this demonstrates that the increase in histone methylation induced by mild folate depletion is not specific to repressive modifications and is probably not directly related to the relatively low level of increased cpg island hypermethylation.

discussion
in this study we hypothesized that prostate cells might be exquisitely sensitive to genetic, epigenetic and phenotypic changes consequent to folate depletion and investigated the potential role that different stages of transformation might play in affecting the response to folate depletion. this topic is clinically relevant as antifolate drugs are currently used in the clinic for the treatment of certain types of cancer as well as infections from opportunistic agents  <cit> . we found that even a mild folate depletion  was sufficient to induce dramatic genetic and epigenetic damage along with changes in prostate cell behaviour compared with cells grown with the supraphysiological levels of folate routinely used in tissue culture . one hundred nanomolar of folate is about five times the amount that negatively impacts cell types such as colon, already known to be sensitive to folate depletion  <cit> . the prostate cells' exquisite sensitivity to folate depletion is consistent with their characteristically high polyamine biosynthesis, which results in extra demand on the methionine cycle and one-carbon metabolism in order to sustain adomet pools  <cit> .

the levels of polyamine biosynthesis might be one of the factors behind the different response to folate depletion in cells at different stages of transformation. polyamine levels are significantly increased during the process of transformation in order to sustain cell hyperproliferation  <cit> . throughout our study, the untransformed cell line c-2d suffered less dramatic changes both at the molecular and phenotypical levels, consistent with c-2d having the lowest polyamine levels among the three cell lines  <cit> .

another mechanism that might differentiate the cells' response to folate depletion could be their ability to efficiently repair dna. cells at more advanced stages of transformation are more likely to have impaired dna repair machinery and might accumulate mutations at a higher rate. consistent with this hypothesis, although for all three cell lines the levels of uracil misincorporation followed closely the increase in the dutp:dttp ratio  - which in turn was more dramatic in cells with higher polyamine biosynthesis - the levels of dna damage measured as dna single strand breaks did not . this suggests that even if the dutp:dttp ratio and the levels of uracil misincorporation were strictly dependent on the inherent folate sensitivity of the cell lines and, therefore, polyamine biosynthesis, the ultimate amount of dna damage might also depend on the cells' ability to repair the dna efficiently. therefore, it is not surprising that we found the highest amount of dna single strand breaks in the metastatic cell line c-2h .

in addition we found that folate depletion by itself, even at  <dig> nm folic acid, can induce major heritable chromosomal rearrangements in prostate cells. whilst it has long been known that low folate levels can induce fragile sites in both human and mouse chromosomes  <cit> , whether or not expression of the fragile sites is associated with chromosomal rearrangements is unclear. spectral karyotype analysis  of the c-2g cells grown with or without mild folate deficiency, identified several novel chromosomal rearrangements upon mild folate depletion , which are probably linked to the altered nucleotide pools, uracil misincorporation and single strand dna breaks we observed in the same cells. we found that a number of the breakpoints for chromosomal translocations mapped in the vicinity of known fragile sites, including a break at 6qc <dig>  corresponding to fra6c <dig> in mouse and the human fra4f  <cit> .

importantly, these novel chromosomal rearrangements were never seen in the parental cell line and, in fact, resulted in increased chromosomal heterogeneity , therefore discounting the possibility of clonal selection of pre-existing changes. this is also important when considering the decreased sensitivity to folate depletion that the cells acquired after growth with limiting amounts of folate . we suggest that cells might have adapted to growth in low folate through up regulation of certain key pathways in order to sustain their proliferation. in support of this hypothesis, when we analysed molecule pools by hplc, we observed that despite imbalance in both the dutp:dttp ratio and adomet:adohcy ratio, the overall levels of key molecules, namely dttp and adomet were maintained .

an intriguing possibility is that upregulation of the thymidine salvage pathway and the methionine salvage pathway might occur in these cells upon mild folate depletion . the thymidine salvage pathway scavenges thymidine from degraded nucleic acids and would, therefore, help in sustaining dttp levels independent of uracil conversion . such a scenario would be expected to result in an accumulation of dump due to a lack of methylation to dtmp, while at the same time result in the sustainment of dttp pools due to salvage. similarly, de novo synthesis of adomet is mainly accomplished by the recycling of adohyc to homocysteine, followed by n5-methyl tetrahydrofolate dependent synthesis of methionine, and is, therefore, dependent on one-carbon metabolism. however, the methionine salvage pathway, which recycles methylthioadenosine out of polyamine biosynthesis into methionine  could contribute to adomet biosynthesis independently of folate and result in sustained adomet levels without utilization of adohcy, which would accumulate as a byproduct of dna, rna and protein methyltransferase reactions. this pathway has been described mainly in liver, but its rate limiting enzyme  is ubiquitous, was originally purified from rat prostate  <cit>  and is highly expressed in all three cell lines  used in this study.

another novel contribution of this work is the demonstration that mild folate depletion induced global cpg island hypermethylation in all three prostate cell lines. some of the methylation events were common among cell lines, suggesting that cpg island hypermethylation under conditions of folate depletion might not be occurring randomly. interestingly, in all the cpg island hypermethylation cases we observed, some methylation was also present in the control cell lines which suggests that mild folate depletion did not induce completely de novo methylation at these promoters but, rather, increased hypermethylation at already susceptible loci. conversely, despite the decreased adomet:adohcy ratio in d <dig> and g <dig> cells, we could not detect global dna hypomethylation as assessed by lc-ms . this result was somewhat surprising but does not preclude the possibility that mild folate depletion induced hypomethylation at satellite repeats, as was previously reported in colon cell lines in vitro  <cit> . consistent with previous findings in the rat liver  <cit> , we also found that, in prostate cells, mild folate depletion induced global histone hypermethylation regardless of whether the specific marks were associated with increased or decreased transcription . all these events, genetic and epigenetic, probably collaborate, resulting in the altered phenotype of the cells that we observed .

CONCLUSIONS
prostate cancer is the second leading cancer causing mortality in men in the usa  <cit> . our data show that prostate cells are exquisitely sensitive to folate depletion, with major genetic and epigenetic consequences resulting in altered cellular phenotypes. insufficient dietary folate intake or antifolate therapies, which are used for the treatment of certain type of cancers as well as infections by opportunistic agents  <cit> , might increase the incidence of prostate cancer due to the potentially negative effects on the genome. folate supplementation on the other hand, although beneficial to untransformed cells, might, in fact, accelerate the growth of existing, dormant prostate cancer cells. this hypothesis is supported by the results of a recent clinical trial designed to study the effects of folate supplementation on colon polyp prevention, which resulted in a significant and unexpected increase in the incidence of prostate cancer  <cit> . conversely, the heightened sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to folate deficiency suggests that therapeutic use of antifolates might be particularly effective in prostate cancer patients.
