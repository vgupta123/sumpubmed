BACKGROUND
the rabbit  is a wild and domesticated species that is used for many purposes including production for meat and fur, biotechnological applications , and as a tool for the study of nutrition, reproduction, toxicology, pharmaceutical research, and pathologies  <cit> . in fact, the rabbit has been extensively used as a model to study infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, syphilis, anthrax, tularemia, poxvirus diseases, and hepatitis e. rabbits are also used for research on autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus  <cit> . the rabbit immune system generates antibody diversity and optimizes affinity through mechanisms that are more efficient than those of mice and other rodents. due to their high specificity and affinity, rabbit antibodies are commercially available for a large number of target antigens.

the rabbit has been included in the mammalian genome project  <cit>  and a 2x followed by a 7x coverage version of the rabbit genome sequence has been released in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the reference genome assembly orycun <dig>   has provided insights to decipher the impact of the domestication process on shaping genomes  <cit> . genomic tools are growing for the rabbit species, complementary to the onset of more and more cost-effective high throughput sequencing methodologies, paving the way to large scale genome-wide expression studies  <cit> . however, very few genome-wide expression studies have been reported to date in the rabbit and most of which have focused on early embryogenesis  <cit>  pluripotent stem cells  <cit> , implantation during gestation  <cit> , ocular research  <cit>  and response of different organs to eimeria infections  <cit> . although rabbits have proven very useful in immunological and infectious disease research, genome-wide expression studies targeting the immune response to various challenges are still limited. our aim was to create genome-wide gene expression datasets representative of various in vitro stimulations of immune cells in rabbits in order to increase knowledge on the rabbit immune responses, to provide new rabbit-specific data for comparative immunology, and to promote that transcriptomics-based approaches are efficient to provide molecular phenotype information to analyze immunity in the rabbit species. we chose to study variations of the transcriptome in rabbit peripheral blood mononuclear cells  using two different stimulations expected to induce either an innate immune response ) or a lymphocyte proliferation  and ionomycin ). lps is part of the outermost layer of gram-negative bacteria and is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern  used for in vitro studies of the innate immune response after bacterial infection. pma, in conjunction with ionomycin, act preferentially on growth and proliferation of immune cells, and stimulate the intracellular production of the cytokines il <dig> and il <dig>  both stimulations were chosen as they are classically used to induce distinct types of immune responses for further characterization. this study stands as the rabbit counterpart of a similar study that was conducted in pig  <cit> , and that has provided much new data on the main gene pathways that were modified following each stimulation. for this purpose, we have designed a rabbit long oligonucleotide-based dna microarray, by enriching a previously customized gene expression design  with a set of well-annotated genes known to be involved in immune and inflammatory responses. we report the striking features of gene expression changes in response to both stimulations over time, relying on gene expression microarrays that are informative, cost-effective and easy to use for genome-wide expression studies in the rabbit. to our knowledge, our study reports for the first time the modifications of transcriptome profiling of pbmcs upon lps of pma-ionomycin stimulation in the rabbit species.

RESULTS
a well-annotated gene expression platform enriched in immunity-related genes for the rabbit species
the rabbit gene expression microarray used in this study combines the customized microarray design  with a set of  <dig> specific rabbit genes involved in the immune system process , and identified to be missing on the previous array. gene set information is available in the additional file  <dig>  this custom microarray has been updated with the latest annotation generated by the rabbit sequencing consortium  <cit> .

the resulting microarray platform includes  <dig> probes,  <dig> of which have chromosome coordinates  and  <dig> are annotated . these annotated probes specify  <dig> genes with a symbol approved by the hugo gene nomenclature committee. indeed, the majority of probes found differentially expressed  after lps or pma-ionomycin treatment were annotated, as shown on table  <dig> table  <dig>

clustering of samples and comparative effect of lps and pma-ionomycin stimulations
pbmcs were isolated from four rabbit blood samples and either mock-stimulated or stimulated with lps or pma-ionomycin for  <dig>  and  <dig>  hours. the principal component analysis  revealed that all samples stimulated by pma-ionomycin clustered according to the treatment and the time of stimulation . the two time-based clusters were clearly separated from mock-stimulated or lps-stimulated samples. conversely, mock-stimulated and lps-stimulated samples defined two close clusters at t <dig> but a unique cluster that consisted of samples from both treatments at t <dig>  the hierarchical clustering analysis  confirmed the pca results. since no sample was found as an outlier, all biological samples were considered for the following steps of the analysis.figure  <dig> 
principal component analysis of microarray data, classified by biological replicates.




the differential expression analysis revealed that the number of de genes increased with time for both stimulations . however, the number of de genes after lps stimulation at t <dig> and t <dig> was approximately  <dig> to  <dig> times lower than after pma-ionomycin stimulation. sets of  <dig> and  <dig> de genes were found after lps stimulation at t <dig> and t <dig>  respectively . by contrast, sets of  <dig> and  <dig> de genes were detected at t <dig> and t <dig>  respectively, after pma-ionomycin stimulation . in addition, the fold change  values with lps-stimulation varied from − <dig>  to  <dig>  at t <dig> and from − <dig>  to  <dig>  at t <dig>  compared to mock-stimulation. for pma-ionomycin stimulation, the fc values ranged from − <dig>  to  <dig>  at t <dig> and from − <dig>  to  <dig>  at t <dig> . the differential analysis showed that the transcriptome profile of pbmcs varied considerably after pma-ionomycin treatment in comparison to the lps treatment. the striking differences in the number of de genes and the fc values between lps and pma-ionomycin treatments might explain the close clustering between lps and mock-stimulated samples.table  <dig>

for the global analysis of biological functions affected by lps stimulation, the de gene lists were submitted to the ingenuity pathway analysis  system. from this analysis  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were identified by ipa at t <dig> and t <dig>  respectively. the global picture provided by figure  <dig> highlights that most genes were found down-regulated at t <dig> conversely to t <dig>  the foremost over-represented down-regulated biological functions  at t <dig> were related to molecular and cellular functions . however, a number of genes involved in biological functions related to inflammatory disease or response were repressed at t <dig>  by contrast, at t <dig>  there was a significant enrichment of up-regulated genes associated with biological functions related to diseases and disorders such as inflammatory response, inflammatory disease and infectious disease. for the molecular and cellular functions, the most represented functions were cell death and survival, cellular growth and proliferation, cellular movement, cellular development and cell-to-cell signaling and interactions. for the physiological system development and functions, the most represented function was the hematological system development and function.

the ipa system identified  <dig> and  <dig> gene networks at t <dig> and t <dig>  respectively. the gene network that groups cytokines and chemokines known to be involved in inflammation responses is presented in figure  <dig> and draws a picture of the kinetics of inflammatory response to lps stimulation. at t <dig>  the lps-related network shown in figure 4a is involved in inflammatory response, cell death and survival, and cellular movement. this network grouped  <dig> de genes, which included two connected genes, cxcl <dig> and il12a, listed in the top-ten up-regulated genes . they are reported to be directly under the control of irf <dig> by ipa.figure  <dig>

genes and biological functions affected by pma-ionomycin stimulation
two large sets of genes were found de at t <dig> and t <dig> , with a slight tendency toward more up-regulated genes than down-regulated genes at both times . as shown in table  <dig>  and additional file  <dig> ), there was a decrease over time in the fc values for up-regulated genes  but an increase over time in the fc of down-regulated genes . a set of  <dig> de probes was shared at both times, and could be divided into a subset of  <dig> probes that were continually de in the same directions at t <dig> and t <dig> , a subset of  <dig> probes that were down-regulated at t <dig> and up-regulated at t <dig>  and a third subset of  <dig> probes that were up-regulated at t <dig> but down-regulated at t <dig> 

the genes csf <dig>  il <dig>  and rgcc  were among the top ten genes found over-expressed at t <dig> and t <dig>  the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor  was by far the most over-expressed gene with a positive fc of  <dig>  at t <dig> and  <dig>  at t <dig> . csf <dig> encodes a cytokine that controls the production, differentiation, and function of granulocytes and macrophages, and the rgcc gene encodes a protein thought to regulate cell cycle progression. all top ten over-expressed genes at t <dig> were still up-regulated at t <dig>  conversely, the genes bco <dig>  cd <dig>  ccnb <dig>  and ncapg found in the top ten over-expressed genes at t <dig> were found to be down-regulated at t <dig>  showing a switch in gene regulation between t <dig> and t <dig>  the beta-carotene oxygenase  <dig> gene  encodes an enzyme, which oxidizes beta-carotene during the biosynthesis of vitamin a. cd <dig> molecule gene  encodes a cytokine that belongs to the tnf ligand family. cd <dig> is a ligand for tnfrsf27/cd <dig> and a surface antigen on activated b and t lymphocytes, and contributes to t cell activation. the cyclin b <dig> gene  encodes a regulatory protein involved in mitosis. the non-smc condensin i complex, subunit g gene  encodes a subunit of the condensin complex, which is responsible for the condensation and stabilization of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis.

the genes ltb and fpr <dig> were both found in the top ten most repressed genes at t <dig> and t <dig> post stimulation. the lymphotoxin beta   encodes a protein which is an inducer of the inflammatory response system and is involved in normal development of lymphoid tissue. in addition, there was an intensification of the repression of the two genes s100a <dig>  and s100a <dig> , which encode proteins of the s <dig> family containing  <dig> ef-hand calcium-binding motifs, involved in cell cycle progression and differentiation. the defensin beta  <dig>  gene was repressed only at t <dig> 

the cytokine and chemokine profiles revealed a continued up-regulation over time of csf <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig>  il17a, il <dig>  il <dig>  ifng, ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  and ccl <dig> , and a down-regulation of il <dig>  il <dig>  il36g, and il <dig>  the cd <dig> molecule gene , known to be induced by the activation of t lymphocytes, was found to be over-expressed at t <dig>  and t <dig> . at t <dig>  there was a notable opposite regulation between over-expressed il <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig>  and il <dig>  and repressed il <dig> and ltb. this opposite regulation was maintained at t <dig>  il <dig> is an immunoregulatory cytokine primarily produced by activated th <dig> cells reported to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. il <dig> is a pleiotropic cytokine that functions as a chemoattractant and a modulator of t cell activation. at t <dig>  a specific up-regulation of il17f, cxcr <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig>  and tnfrsf <dig>  together with a repression of il <dig> and cxcl <dig> were detected. at t <dig>  a specific up-regulation of ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  il <dig>  tnf, il12a, and il <dig>  together with a repression of il1r <dig>  cxcr <dig>  il1b, tnfsf <dig>  and il1rap were shown.table  <dig>

the transcription factors tbx <dig>  stat5a, and stat5b were up-regulated at t <dig> and t <dig>  whereas gata <dig> was slightly repressed at both times . tbx <dig> is the t-box  <dig> gene that stands as the human ortholog of the mouse tbx21/tbet gene. this gene was reported to act as a th <dig> cell-specific transcription factor and controls the expression of ifng  <cit> . stat5a and stat5b are both members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription  family of transcription factors that respond to cytokines and growth factors. stat5a encodes a protein that is activated by il <dig> and csf <dig>  and stat5b encodes a protein reported to mediate the signal transduction triggered by various cell ligands, such as il <dig> and il <dig>  at t <dig>  two additional members of the stat family of transcription factors, stat <dig> and stat <dig>  were found up-regulated and two other members of the gata families were slightly repressed . foxp <dig> was not found affected by the pma-ionomycin stimulation. we checked the differential expression of the thrombospondin gene  that was found to be the most repressed gene in porcine pbmcs stimulated for 24 hours by pma-ionomycin  <cit> . in rabbit pbmcs, the thbs <dig> gene was repressed only at t <dig> and with a limited fc of − <dig> .

the genes encoding class ii molecules of the major histocompatibility complex  were found to be repressed. the most repressed genes belong to the dr series followed by dm, dq and dp. this repression was initiated early after stimulation since dma, dmb and drb <dig> were already found down-regulated at t <dig> . in addition, few probes corresponding to mhc class i transcripts were found down-regulated. interestingly, and in agreement with data obtained in pig  <cit> , we observed an up-regulation of genes encoding heat shock proteins  and many genes involved in the cascade of peptide processing before loading to the mhc molecule binding groove , calnexin , tapasin ), despite an overall down-regulation of genes encoding class i and ii molecules .

at t <dig> and t <dig>  subsets of  <dig>  and  <dig>  de genes were mapped into the ipa system. the relative representation of biological functions between t <dig> and t <dig> was quite similar . by excluding all genes associated to cancer, ipa revealed an enrichment of genes principally related to molecular and cellular functions , followed by an enrichment of genes associated with diseases and disorders , and physiological system development and function . these observations were reinforced by the analysis of the set of  <dig> genes found to be de at both t <dig> and t <dig>  and showed a predominance of genes associated with molecular and cellular functions. the  <dig> genes found down-regulated at t <dig> and up-regulated at t <dig> were predominantly associated to the biological functions cell cycle, dna replication recombination and repair, and cellular assembly and organization. for the  <dig> genes found up-regulated at t <dig> and down-regulated at t <dig>  there was an enrichment in biological functions relating to cell death and survival, cell growth and proliferation, cell development, tissue morphology, and hematological system development and function. for these two gene sets, the enriched biological functions aligned well with those found for the genes that revealed no inverted regulation compared to mock-stimulation at t <dig> and t <dig> 

the pma-ionomycin network analysis was deliberately limited to  <dig> networks, including up to  <dig> genes each. the network shown in figure 5a highlights transcription factors gata <dig> and gata <dig>  down-regulated at t <dig> and involved in many aspects of cell growth. in the second network , stat <dig> is up-regulated and in a central position, inhibiting il10ra but activating rgcc. this transcription factor stat <dig> is required for the development of th <dig> cells from naïve cd4+ t cells and ifng production in response to il <dig> figure  <dig>

a set of eight genes was chosen for microarray data validation by real time quantitative reverse transcription pcr . these genes were selected according to their expression level , in order to test genes found de at t <dig> and t <dig> for both lps and pma-ionomycin stimulations . the b2m and gapdh genes were included as reference genes for data normalization. a linear regression was performed between the log <dig> values of microarray and qrt-pcr data. a significant spearman correlation coefficient  was calculated between the two techniques , thus validating the microarray data and confirming the reliability of the transcriptome analyses.figure  <dig>

discussion
cytokine profile induced by lps stimulation in rabbit pbmcs
lps is an outer membrane component of gram-negative bacteria and the crystal structure of the trans-envelope protein complex inserting lps in the outer leaflet of the outer envelope has been very recently described  <cit> . lipid a is the main pamp of lps. interactions between lps and tlr <dig>  a sensor for lps  <cit>  at the surface of macrophages and dendritic cells, trigger the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and activate the innate immune system by myd <dig>  dependent or myd <dig> independent pathways  <cit> . in our study, an early up-regulation of il12a and cxcl <dig> together with a slight repression of cd <dig> was found at t <dig>  this lps-induced cd <dig> repression observed at t <dig> was comparable to in vivo human studies  <cit> , highlighting the immunodepressive effect of lps on rabbit pbmcs. up-regulation of a wider range of inflammatory cytokines was observed at t <dig> with a differential expression between mock-stimulation and lps-stimulation for il <dig>  il1a, il1b, and tnf. in lps-stimulated human whole blood  <cit> , it has been reported that gene activations of both il <dig> and tnf were induced early, after only 2– <dig> hours and then rapidly declined. several studies have shown the synergy between il1b and tnf  <cit> . when both cytokines were administered to healthy humans, they induced fever, inflammation, tissue destruction, or resulted in the development of sickness behavior, and depressed mood when combined with il <dig>  <cit> . moreover, il1b and tnf have been shown to stimulate the expression of il36g in keratinocytes  <cit> , confirming results at t <dig>  our results suggest a significant triggering of the myd <dig> dependent pathway in dendritic cells that is characterized by il <dig> production and followed by a t cell differentiation toward th <dig> phenotype  <cit> , as represented in figure 5a. the onset of the inflammation process was detected at t <dig> but clearly amplified at t <dig> as represented in figure 5b, showing that the data obtained at t <dig> did not provide an accurate overall picture of gene expression picture upon lps stimulation. in addition, gene transcription levels did not return to basal levels at t <dig>  as already shown in pigs  <cit> . this late increase in inflammatory cytokine transcription contrasts with results on bovine pbmcs for which the inflammation process was triggered much earlier with a maximal expression of inflammation gene expression at t <dig>  <cit> . for both t <dig> and t <dig> after lps activation, the interferon regulatory factor  <dig>  was found to be under-expressed. in  <dig>  krausgruber et al.  <cit>  highlighted a critical role for the transcription factor irf <dig> in human m <dig> macrophage polarization and defined it as a transcriptional repressor. moreover, an activation of the th <dig> response by irf <dig> has been reported.

putative specific features of rabbit pbmcs upon lps stimulation
il <dig>  was not de in our experimental conditions at the transcript level at both t <dig> and t <dig>  whereas nucleotide probes specific for this gene are available on the microarrays used for the transcriptome analyses. indeed il <dig> is a chemokine known to act as one of the major mediators of the inflammatory response and has been reported to be up-regulated after lps stimulation in many mammals including cattle  <cit>  and pig  <cit> . as opposed to other species, the possibility that t <dig> might be too late for detecting an up-regulation of il <dig> in rabbits cannot be excluded. recent reports have shown that bacterial-host interactions affect histone acetylation, phosphorylation and methylation state at the tlr <dig> and il <dig> promoter in host cells  <cit> . in cattle, it has been hypothesized that host individual variability in response to lps stimulation could be due to epigenetic variations modulating individual il <dig> expression in pbmcs  <cit>  and in dermal fibroblasts  <cit> .

in addition, defb <dig> and bpi were down-regulated at t <dig> compared to mock-stimulation, whereas they were expected to be up-stimulated due to their bactericidal activity  <cit> . defensins form a family of microbicidal and cytotoxic peptides, and defb <dig> encodes an antimicrobial peptide implicated in the resistance of epithelial surfaces to microbial colonization  <cit> . beta defensins have thus an antimicrobial activity that defend epithelial surfaces including the skin, gastrointestinal, and respiratory tracts. bpi encodes a lps binding protein associated with neutrophil granules in humans, and has bactericidal activity on gram-negative organisms  <cit> . upon lps activation, bpi may have several functions, as inhibition of endothelial cell growth and inhibition of dendritic cell maturation, or as an anti-angiogenic, chemoattractant or opsonization agent  <cit> . to our knowledge, no study has shown down-regulation of defb <dig> or bpi in rabbit pbmcs upon lps activation. however, a down-regulated expression of defb <dig> has been shown following infections by several pathogens  in epithelial cells of the digestive and respiratory tracts in humans or mice  <cit> . in our experimental model, we do not have a clear explanation for the down-regulation of defb <dig> and bpi, but our results suggest the onset of an immune escape mechanism upon lps stimulation that needs further investigation. we cannot rule out that both genes are induced early after stimulation, before the time window chosen for this study. additional data are required to better assess why no increase of il <dig> transcription was detected during the global inflammatory process induced by lps stimulation in rabbit pbmcs between  <dig> and 24 hours post stimulation, and why a down-regulation of bactericidal activity-related genes was found at t <dig>  it could be interesting to carry out new kinetics studies that include earlier time points , as well as a mid-time point  and a late time point at 48 hours post-stimulation, thus providing new data to validate or not the hypothesis that rabbits differ from mice and humans for the in vitro production of il <dig>  and up-regulation of defb <dig> and bpi by pbmcs upon lps stimulation.

sets of genes commonly affected by lps stimulation in various mammalian species
our results have confirmed a wide range of genes, other than cytokines and chemokines, which were affected by lps stimulation in rabbit pbmcs. this has already been reported in other species, thus illustrating shared innate immunity responses among mammals.

the saa <dig> gene belongs to the family encoding the serum amyloid a  proteins. as reported in pigs  <cit> , the saa <dig> gene was found up-regulated upon lps stimulation in pbmcs at t <dig>  the association of increased levels of saa proteins with inflammatory states has been largely reported  <cit> , but the precise functions of saa proteins still need clarification. saa has been reported to be involved in the establishment and maintenance of inflammation, and as an opsonin it facilitates phagocytosis of gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . saa acts as an antiapoptotic agent for neutrophils  <cit> , and directly drives a regulatory program in neutrophils by stimulating them to produce il <dig> that has anti-inflammatory effects  <cit> . the strong up-regulation of il <dig> detected in rabbit pbmcs at t <dig> might be related to this role of saa. in addition, saa was recently shown to induce mitogenic signals in regulatory t cells, by enhancing the secretion of il1b and il <dig> by monocytes, and driving them toward a phenotype resembling immature dendritic cells  <cit> . indeed, il <dig> and il1b genes were both strongly up-regulated together with saa <dig>  our results suggest that the rabbit is an interesting species for further study of saa-associated regulatory mechanisms, which could be shared across mammals.

the s100a <dig> gene was strongly up-regulated in rabbit lps-stimulated pbmcs at t <dig>  as reported in pig pbmcs under similar lps stimulation conditions  <cit> . s100a <dig> gene belongs to the family that encodes the s <dig> proteins. approximately  <dig> different s <dig> proteins have been characterized so far  <cit> . a common feature shared by all the s <dig> proteins is the presence of a pair of calcium-binding helix-loop-helix domains referred to as ef-hand calcium-binding regions toward either end of the protein and separated by a hinge region  <cit> . the broad diversity of s <dig> proteins is related to a multitude of biological functions such as cell growth, cell differentiation, and cell survival in numerous physiological and pathological conditions in all cells of the body. furthermore, all s <dig> proteins are likely to induce some changes in the actin cytoskeleton organization  <cit> . s100a <dig> is expressed in the myeloid cell lineage, and is found in abundance in granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes in human. extracellular s100a <dig> can induce directional migration and chemotactic responsiveness of monocytes and neutrophils in vitro  <cit> .

at t <dig> post lps stimulation, we detected a very strong transcription increase of the gene f <dig> that encodes the coagulation factor iii or thromboplastin, a cell surface glycoprotein that enables cells to initiate the blood coagulation cascades. it has been long reported that blood cells generate thromboplastin activity upon incubation with lps or gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . it has been further established that monocytes are the blood cells that possess this property  <cit> , and that collaboration with lymphocytes is required for a rapid induction of procoagulant activity  <cit> . induction of pro-coagulant activity of hepatic macrophages by lps has already been demonstrated in rabbits  <cit> . in this paper, we demonstrate by a genome-wide and a non-focused approach that a pro-coagulant activity is also strongly induced by lps in pbmcs in the rabbit.

a concerted action of s100a <dig>  saa, and thrombotic functions during inflammatory diseases has been reported in humans  <cit> . here, we clearly show that in rabbit pbmcs stimulated in vitro by lps, a strong combined increase in the expression of the corresponding rabbit genes  is detected.

pma-ionomycin stimulation affects many more genes than lps stimulation
pma is a diester of phorbol and a potent tumor promoter often used in biomedical research to activate the signal transduction enzyme protein kinase c . for in vitro cell stimulation, pma is used in conjunction with ionomycin, a ca2+ ionophore produced by the bacterium streptomyces conglobatus. the number of de genes after pma-ionomycin stimulation was found to be  <dig> and  <dig> times higher at t <dig> and t <dig>  respectively, by comparing to the number of de genes after lps stimulation. these findings are in agreement with a similar study in swine in which we reported that ten times more genes were de after pma-ionomycin stimulation than after lps stimulation  <cit> . this difference is consistent with the dynamics of the responses to lps and pma-ionomycin, since it was observed at t <dig> and maintained at t <dig>  as previously discussed  <cit> , this observation might reflect that lps targets only a limited set of monocytes and macrophages expressing cd <dig>  <cit> , while pma-ionomycin has a much wider spectrum of target cells. we found  <dig> probes that were down- and up-regulated at t <dig> and t <dig>  respectively, and vice versa for another  <dig> probe set. all these genes relate to the same biological functions than those associated to genes found only up- or down-regulated at both t <dig> and t <dig>  thus likely reflecting a dynamic process that includes combined actions of genes toward a concerted immune response.

pma-ionomycin stimulation induced early th <dig>  itreg , and th <dig> responses at t <dig> followed by an increase in the th <dig> response at t24
at t <dig>  the cytokine profile revealed a very strong up-regulation of il <dig> and il <dig>  which are produced by th <dig> population subsets  <cit> . both cytokines were still up-regulated at t <dig> in comparison to mock-stimulated cells but with a much lower fold-change than at t <dig> . we could not detect up-regulation of transcription factors that induce cells to commit to a th <dig> phenotype such as stat <dig> and gata <dig>  similarly, il <dig> could be detected at t <dig> but the up-regulation was decreased at t <dig>  as previously described in pigs  <cit> . this cytokine is identified as a hallmark of itreg lymphocytes  <cit> . the foxp <dig> gene known to be involved in itreg lymphocyte differentiation was not found to be affected by pma-ionomycin stimulation. in addition, il17f was moderately up-regulated at t <dig>  in comparison to mock-stimulated pbmcs, and il17a was found to be de at both t <dig> and t <dig> with a decrease in the fc between stimulated and non-stimulated pbmcs at t <dig> in comparison to t <dig>  all these results suggest a very early expression of th <dig>  itreg, and th17-associated cytokines with a progressive slow-down after t <dig>  conversely, we detected an increase in th <dig> phenotypes between t <dig> and t <dig>  indeed, the two lineage-defining transcription factors stat <dig> and tbx <dig>  were significantly up-regulated at t <dig>  and at t <dig> and t <dig>  respectively. stat <dig> and tbx <dig> genes drive the th <dig> cell commitment and ifng is the main th <dig> cytokine. these data show that pma-ionomycin stimulation induces a th <dig> response that is not only maintained, but was found to increase at t <dig>  this coincides with results we have previously reported, where a predominance of a th <dig> response after pma-ionomycin treatment of pbmcs was seen in swine for t <dig>  our results in rabbits suggest that the th <dig> response induced by pma-ionomycin might be maintained on a longer term than other responses, thus confirming a predominance of a th <dig> response after 24 h stimulation as previously shown in pigs  <cit> . recent reports have demonstrated a plasticity of t-helper cell differentiation  <cit> , thus suggesting that t cell differentiation is not always the result of a direct differentiation from naïve t cells but that new cell commitments may also occur after a reprogramming of differentiated cells  <cit> . from our data, we cannot determine whether the observed th <dig> phenotype increase is due to the reprogramming of differentiated t cells or to the direct differentiation of naïve t cells.

a strong up-regulation of csf <dig> and a down-regulation of il <dig> induced by pma-ionomycin stimulation in favor of cell proliferation
the most up-regulated gene at t <dig> and t <dig> after pma-ionomycin stimulation was csf <dig>  a cytokine that functions as a white blood cell growth factor. csf <dig> stimulates stem cells to produce granulocytes  and monocytes  <cit> . by contrast, the cytokine il <dig> was down-regulated at both t <dig> and t <dig>  with a high negative fold-change.

several studies have shown that il <dig> is constitutively expressed in peripheral blood monocytes and that there is a direct link between il <dig> expression and apoptosis  <cit> , and with autoimmune and allergic diseases  <cit> . whereas some genes  have been shown to be down-regulated during fas-mediated or camptothecin-induced apoptosis in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes  <cit> , our results confirmed previous studies where down-regulation of il <dig> is associated with t cell activation and proliferation  <cit> . il <dig> has also been described as an important growth-promoting factor in multiple myeloma  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this report, we have characterized the gene profiling modification of rabbit pbmcs upon in vitro stimulation by either lps or a mixture of pma and ionomycin, thus providing genome-wide expression data on immune responses for the rabbit species. our results were consistent with data previously cited for other mammalian species, thus confirming that the rabbit is a relevant model for immunity studies.

presently, the rabbit is no longer a species lacking genomic tools. the availability of a 7x coverage of the genome sequence  <cit> , together with the progress of related information on annotation and snp variations, constitute highly valuable tools for launching large-scale genome-wide studies in this species  <cit> . for transcriptomic studies, it is now widely acknowledged that rnaseq-approaches are well adapted to exhaustively detect all transcription variations between different conditions together with snp variations among individuals. the rabbit is a very useful model in biomedical research  <cit> . as a livestock species, there is a need for large scale studies on resistance to disease and reduction of the use of antibiotics in production systems. the rabbit species does not have the same financial means as other species such as cattle. this study shows that a commercial well-annotated microarray is now available for rabbits, and can be used in combination with rnaseq approaches. due to their efficiency in the study of immune responses, as well as their cost-effectiveness, the use of microarrays can be easily expanded to large cohorts of animals either for biomedical research or for improving knowledge on immunity and resistance to diseases to promote safe and efficient farm systems.
