BACKGROUND
gene expression is regulated by the interplay of various kinds of factors including transcription factors  that bind to dnas in a sequence-specific manner, the chromatin structure  <cit> , and the association of genes with the nuclear lamina/matrix  <cit> . many tfs directly switch gene expression on or off, whereas others factors may serve as constraints . thus, in addition to identifying static states of gene expression  it is important to characterize the dynamic status, which is the capacity to modify the level of expression. for example, genes with h3k27me <dig> chromatin marks at promoters are not only suppressed  but also poised for activation   <cit> . responsiveness of genes to perturbations is a dynamic property that was never studied systematically because such studies require the analysis of expression profiles of cells responding to a large variety of disturbances, and such databases did not exist before. the only comparable study used indiscriminately all data for a specific human array platform in the gene expression omnibus  database, which included both perturbations of the same cell type as well as differences between various cell types, tissues, and organs  <cit> . thus, it did not distinguish between responsiveness of genes and their tissue-specific expression.

this paper examines the responsiveness of all genes in mouse es cells estimated using our recently published database on gene expression changes after controlled induction of  <dig> transcription factors  and other genes  <cit> . in this experiment, we established mouse es cell lines in which individual transgenic tfs were induced by the removal of doxycycline. each manipulated tf modifies the expression of many downstream target genes, including other tfs, which can in turn activate or repress genes even farther downstream. thus, we can quantify responsiveness of not only direct targets of manipulated tfs, but also indirect  target genes. we show that responsive genes mostly have regulatory functions and a propensity to become tissue-specific upon differentiation, whereas many non-responsive genes have housekeeping functions. to examine the relationship between the responsiveness and tissue-specificity of gene expression, we performed whole-genome expression profiling of  <dig> mouse adult organs/tissues. responsiveness of genes in undifferentiated es cells appears to be a better predictor for tissue-specific gene expression than other known markers . among genes with cpg islands, responsiveness is strongly associated with their epigenetic marks , as well as with binding of certain tfs in promoters. these results suggest that tf-responsiveness can be used as a novel indicator of the dynamic status of genes.

RESULTS
definition of tf-responsiveness
we define tf-responsiveness as a gene's readiness for expression change, irrespective of direction , upon an induced change in the abundance of various tfs. some genes may change their expression following the manipulation of a wide range of tfs, whereas others may react specifically to one or a few tfs. it is thus important to assess tf-responsiveness based on the data from a wide range of tf manipulations. to differentiate between upregulation and downregulation of genes, we use three indicators of tf-responsiveness for each gene: maximum logratio for upregulation, ui; downregulation, di; and the average for both up- and downregulation, bi:

  ui=maxj; di=maxj; bi=average; 

where xij is the logratio of expression change of i-th gene after perturbation j. term "responsiveness" is similar to "sensitivity", however the latter term is traditionally applied to a single type of perturbation . thus, here we use the term "responsiveness" to describe the combined sensitivity of gene expression to various perturbations.

data sets used in the study
a list of gene expression data sets used in this study is given in additional file  <dig>  to analyze tf-responsiveness of genes in es cells, we used the following two data sets. first, the "nia es bank,  <dig> genes" data includes gene expression profiles of es cells  <dig> days after the induction of each of  <dig> genes   <cit> . figure 1a shows a typical response of genes  located sequentially in a  <dig>  mb window on chromosome  <dig>  second, the "nia other es perturbations" data include time-courses expression profiles 1- <dig> days after downregulation of the pou5f <dig> or sox <dig> genes  <cit> , and expression profiles of es cells  <dig> days after leukemia inhibitory factor  removal, addition of retinoic acid   <cit> , or addition of inhibitors of fgfr , mek , and gsk  signaling pathways. the expression profiles of es cells after treating them with inhibitors of fgfr, mek, and gsk for  <dig> days were newly generated for this work and submitted to the public database . the results showed that all three inhibitors downregulated rxrg and wt <dig> and upregulated gbx <dig> and plagl <dig> . we also observed inhibitor-specific effects: fgfr inhibitor caused upregulation of gata <dig> and gata <dig> and downregulation of myc; mek inhibitor caused upregulation of gbp <dig> and downregulation of erg <dig> and nr4a3; and gsk inhibitor caused upregulation of t, nkx1- <dig>  msx <dig>  and evx <dig> and downregulation of tcfec and rfx <dig> 

to analyze the tissue specificity of gene expression, we used two datasets of expression profiles. first, the "nia differentiated cells/tissues" set includes expression profiles of  <dig> mouse adult organs and tissues , as well as published data on gene expression in trophectoderm stem  cells, neural stem  cells, placenta, several lines of fibroblasts, and newborn mice  <cit> . the "nia differentiated cells/tissues" microarray data were newly generated for this work and submitted to the public database . second, the "gnf mouse tissues" set includes expression profiles of  <dig> tissues from the mouse gene atlas v <dig>  <cit>  after excluding expression profiles of oocytes, early embryos, and gonads, as they may include undifferentiated cells.

we also used tf binding data, which was inferred from published chip-seq data  <cit>  as well as data on whole-genome chromatin modifications for h3k4me <dig>  h3k27me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  <cit> , and h3k9me <dig>  <cit> . relative expression of genes in es cells was estimated using rna-seq data  <cit>  and transcript coordinates from the nia mouse gene index  <cit> . see the methods section for further detail.

estimating the tf-responsiveness
indicators of tf-responsiveness  were estimated for  <dig>  non-redundant genes based on the "nia es bank,  <dig> genes" data set . although the microarray platform we used represented  <dig>  non-redundant genes, we analyzed only those genes  whose expression was determined with sufficient accuracy and whose transcription start sites  were known . tf-responsiveness for upregulation  and downregulation  are positively correlated , which indicates that genes upregulated by overexpression of some tfs tend to be downregulated by overexpression of other tfs . a heatmap also showed that many genes that were strongly upregulated following one perturbation were also strongly downregulated by another kind of perturbation . the positive correlation between ui and di was the basis for considering tf-responsiveness as a general dynamic state of a gene that can be applied to both upregulation and downregulation of its expression. to check if measurements of tf-responsiveness were reproducible, we analyzed an independent data set "nia other perturbations." estimates of tf-responsiveness, bi, from both data sets showed strong correlation , indicating a high level of reproducibility and independence from the perturbation type .

as the spectrum for tf-responsiveness of genes was continuous, we split all the genes examined for expression profiling into three parts: responsive , borderline, and non-responsive  genes . because genes with low expression generally had higher levels of tf-responsiveness than highly-expressed genes, we used floating thresholds to separate these groups of genes  . all responsive genes had statistically significant responses to manipulation of tfs, based on anova . further analysis is focused on the comparison of two extreme groups of genes: responsive  and non-responsive .

because there is a possibility that genes with high expression show weak response to perturbations simply due to saturation or miscalibration of microarray signals, we tested the sensitivity of the microarray by serial dilution of mrna  <cit> . our results showed that saturation was detected only in  <dig> % of genes, and microarray signals were well-calibrated in the full dynamic range of gene expression levels. the difference in tf-responsiveness among genes cannot be attributed to differential mrna stability because groups of responsive and non-responsive genes had similar distributions of mrna decay rates . data on mrna degradation was taken from our database   <cit> . the mean mrna decay rate of responsive genes  was only  <dig> % higher than that of non-responsive genes ; this difference is too small to explain a 3-fold gap between averages of tf-responsiveness in these groups of genes .

functional annotation of responsive and non-responsive genes
to characterize responsive and non-responsive genes, we first analyzed their possible functions by examining gene ontology  classifications. overrepresented go terms for responsive genes included various kinds of regulatory functions  . the full list of overrepresented go terms with statistical analysis can be found in additional file  <dig>  by contrast, overrepresented go terms for non-responsive genes included various kinds of housekeeping functions . it is well known that housekeeping genes have stable expression levels in various kinds of cells and tissues  <cit> , but our data shows that housekeeping genes are also somehow shielded from a wide variety of artificial disturbances. this finding indicates that genes with regulatory and housekeeping functions have clearly different dynamic states.

tf-responsiveness of genes in es cells is correlated with tissue-specific expression upon cell differentiation
because non-responsiveness appeared to be associated with housekeeping functions, we decided to check if, on the contrary, genes that are responsive in es cells are associated with tissue-specific functions in differentiated cells. we used two datasets on murine gene expression: "nia differentiated cells/tissues" and "gnf mouse tissues" . the degree of tissue specificity of genes was quantified by the information measure, which is based on shannon's entropy  <cit> . we found that the information measure increased with increasing tf-responsiveness of genes in es cells . the results were consistent among two databases, but the relationship between tf-responsiveness and tissue specificity was stronger in the nia database. the results thus indicate that responsive genes in undifferentiated es cells tend to become tissue-specific upon differentiation.

it is conceivable, however, that the association of tf-responsiveness with tissue-specificity may have resulted from a non-random selection of tfs used in our perturbation experiments. to address this issue, we repeated the analysis after dividing the data to  <dig> functional subsets of tfs according to their expression in es cells and differentiated organs and cells, as well as information measure of tissue specificity:  es cell-specific ,  tissue-specific , and  widely expressed . these subsets of induced tfs yielded highly correlated values of tf-responsiveness  , which were strongly associated with tissue specificity of responding genes for all subsets of manipulated tfs . thus, the association between tf-responsiveness with tissue-specificity is stable and does not seem to be related to the function of manipulated tfs.

it has been reported that tissue-specific genes tend to have a tata box but no cpg islands  <cit> . thus, we used linear regression to assess the effect of these factors, together with tf-responsiveness of genes in es cells, on the degree of tissue-specificity. in both databases , the tf-responsiveness of genes in es cells was the best predictor of tissue specificity . considering that  <dig> % of responsive genes have cpg islands, the correlation between tf-responsiveness and tissue-specificity may seem contradictory to the notion that tissue-specific genes have no cpg islands. this prompted us to further examine the characteristics of the top  <dig>  tissue-specific genes selected on the basis of the highest information measure. we found that more than a third  of these tissue-specific genes had cpg islands . this is consistent with another observation that 24% of brain-specific promoters have cpg islands, although the proportion of tissue-specific promoters with cpg islands in other tissues is lower   <cit> . our data showed that tissue-specific genes with cpg islands had higher tf-responsiveness in undifferentiated es cells than non-tissue-specific genes with cpg islands , indicating their special dynamic status. tata box is over-represented among tissue-specific genes  compared to other genes , but it has only a weak association with tf-responsiveness of genes with cpg islands .

tf-responsiveness of genes in es cells is correlated with histone modifications and binding of tfs
to examine the relationship between tf-responsiveness of genes and their known features, we analyzed available data on chromatin modifications and binding of various tfs to gene promoters in es cells. first, we searched for possible overrepresented sequence motifs  in promoters of non-responsive and responsive genes using cisfinder  <cit>  and identified gabp, nrf <dig>  yy <dig>  srebp <dig>  and mit <dig> motifs for non-responsive genes . motif srebp <dig> was described by  <cit>  and mit <dig> was over-represented in mammalian promoters  <cit> , although the tf that binds to this motif remains unknown. the tata box was over-represented in promoters of responsive genes with cpg islands. next, we estimated the proportion of genes that carried specific histone modifications, binding of tfs based on published chip-seq data  <cit> , and putative tf-binding motifs identified above. the most striking differences between non-responsive and responsive genes were observed for genes with cpg islands: responsive genes tended to bear the h3k27me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> chromatin marks, whereas non-responsive genes tended to have a h3k36me <dig> chromatin mark, binding of e2f <dig>  zfx, myc, and mycn within  <dig> bp from tss, and binding motifs of gabp, nrf <dig>  and yy <dig> in promoters . among genes with no cpg islands, responsive genes were enriched in h3k4me <dig> chromatin marks and binding of several tfs to distal portions of promoters; however the effects of these factors were much weaker than for genes with cpg islands .

in addition to qualitative categories of histone methylation, we examined quantitative "strength" of methylation as represented by the number of chip-seq tags within  <dig> kb distance from tss for h3k4me <dig> and  <dig> kb distance from tss for h3k27me <dig> based on data from  <cit> . among genes with cpg islands, h3k4me <dig> chromatin, and no qualitatively-assigned h3k27me <dig> peaks, responsive genes had weaker h3k <dig> tri-methylation levels and stronger residual h3k <dig> tri-methylation levels than non-responsive genes .

to further analyze the effect of major factors on the tf-responsiveness of genes, we used linear regression analysis, as this method helps distinguish true functional relations between cell characteristics from mere correlations  <cit> . regression analysis of tf-responsiveness measured by the index bi  for the top  <dig> qualitative factors and  <dig> quantitative factors  identified from the comparison of responsive and non-responsive genes revealed that a large proportion of the variation in tf-responsiveness of genes with cpg islands could be attributed to chromatin modifications, binding of tfs, and the presence of tf binding motifs  . especially, the presence of h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> chromatin marks and the strength of h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> tri-methylation had a major unique contribution to the level of tf-responsiveness of genes. binding of e2f <dig> and the presence of gabp binding motif also had a strong effect. by contrast, regression analysis of genes without cpg islands showed a weak dependency between tf-responsiveness and  <dig> top factors  .

the strongest association of h3k27me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  and h4k4me <dig> chromatin marks with the tf-responsiveness of genes with cpg islands prompted us to examine this relationship in greater detail. the proportion of genes with h3k27me <dig> marks, measured in groups of  <dig> genes with a similar level of tf-responsiveness, increased with increasing tf-responsiveness , whereas the proportion of genes with h3k36me <dig> marks and the strength of h3k <dig> tri-methylation decreased with increasing tf-responsiveness  . this relationship remained the same even if tf-responsiveness of genes was measured by ui or di , indicating that the association is not specific to either upregulated or downregulated genes. similar relationships with chromatin marks were observed if responsiveness of genes was measured using the alternative data set "nia other perturbations" . presence of the h3k27me <dig> chromatin marks among genes that were upregulated during differentiation of es cells is consistent with the previous finding that these genes are silent in es cells but poised for activation  <cit> . however, as this chromatin mark was also overrepresented among downregulated genes , many genes with h3k27me <dig> marks were not fully suppressed in es cells and were poised for both upregulation and downregulation. strong downregulation of  <dig> genes with h3k27me <dig> chromatin marks, selected on the basis of microarray data, was previously confirmed by pcr  <cit> . similarly, the presence of the h3k36me <dig> chromatin marks and strong tri-methylation of h3k <dig> among genes that were not upregulated following the induction of tfs is consistent with the notion that these genes are already active and thus cannot be activated further  <cit> . however, this reasoning does not seem to explain why genes with h3k36me <dig> chromatin and strong tri-methylation of h3k <dig> had low tf-responsiveness for downregulation .

because the association of h3k27me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  and h3k4me <dig> chromatin marks with tf-responsiveness of genes can also be mediated by their effects on expression level, we analyzed the relationship between tf-responsiveness and chromatin status within groups of genes with similar expression levels. for simplicity, we limited the analysis to genes with cpg islands because they had a strong correlation between tf-responsiveness and chromatin status. the analysis revealed that the proportion of genes with h3k27me <dig> histone marks was consistently higher among responsive genes than among non-responsive genes with the same expression level . by contrast, the proportion of genes with the h3k36me <dig> histone mark as well as the strength of h3k <dig> tri-methylation was lower among responsive genes than among non-responsive genes with the same expression level, except genes with very low expression, which had no h3k36me <dig> histone marks at all . taken together, the data indicate that association of h3k27me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  and h3k4me <dig> chromatin marks with tf-responsiveness of genes is a novel dynamic feature of chromatin modifications and is not reduced to epigenetic control of stable gene expression levels.

discussion
this study provides the assessment of the dynamic status of mammalian genes in es cells by the analysis of their tf-responsiveness to manipulation of  <dig> tfs and  <dig> other genes. comparison with an independent data set shows that measurements of tf-responsiveness are reproducible. the group of responsive genes, which are readily upregulated or downregulated depending on the kind of perturbation, appears to be enriched in regulatory functions. the group of non-responsive genes with steady expression levels unchanged after various perturbations is enriched in housekeeping functions. responsive genes in es cells tend to become tissue-specific upon terminal differentiation. the tf-responsiveness of genes in es cells appears to be the best predictor of tissue-specificity, which can be used in combination with other predictors . tissue-specific genes are enriched not only in the group of genes with a tata box and no cpg island, as was found before  <cit> , but also among genes with cpg islands that have high tf-responsiveness in es cells. this is consistent with the previous estimate that 40% of genes with cpg islands show tissue restricted expression  <cit> .

tf-responsiveness of genes with cpg islands has a strong association with chromatin modifications and binding of certain tfs to promoters. the proportion of genes with h3k27me <dig> chromatin marks increases, whereas the proportion of genes with h3k36me <dig> chromatin marks as well as the strength of h3k <dig> tri-methylation decreases with increasing tf-responsiveness of genes. it is well known that h3k27me <dig> marks suppress gene expression, and h3k36me <dig> marks are indicators of genes with high expression  <cit> . however, our finding shows that in addition to the effect on gene expression level, these chromatin modifications are associated with the tf-responsiveness of genes. furthermore, we found that binding of several tfs  and the presence of tf binding motifs  in proximal regulatory regions are associated with low tf-responsiveness. because these factors correlate negatively with the h3k27me <dig> chromatin mark  <cit> , it is possible that they can control the type of chromatin modification , and in this way indirectly reduce the tf-responsiveness of genes. however, linear regression shows that these tfs also have a direct negative effect on tf-responsiveness that is not mediated by chromatin modifications in es cells.

how is gene tf-responsiveness formed and maintained in es cells? low tf-responsiveness can be caused by tightly closed chromatin, absence of tf binding sites, or missing cofactors of transcription regulation. our finding that promoters of many low responsive genes are occupied by e2f <dig>  zfx, and mycn, supports another possibility that they have a very stable transcription-initiation complex that occupies the promoter and prevents binding of other tfs. alternatively, it is conceivable that low tf-responsiveness of genes can be maintained actively via a stabilizing effect of negative feedback: a slight increase of transcription caused by external perturbation could increase the methylation of h3k <dig>  <cit> , which, in turn, increases deacetylation of histones and decreases the level of expression, closing the negative feedback loop. for example, the eaf <dig> protein  in yeast binds to h3k36me <dig> and h3k36me <dig>  causing deacetylation of histones  <cit> . although the main function of this effect is to suppress cryptic promoters in the coding region  <cit> , it may also cause some decrease in the rate of normal transcription.

high tf-responsiveness of genes could be explained by the presence of tf binding sites in the promoter, de-condensed chromatin, and the presence of cofactors of transcriptional regulation. however, mechanisms that amplify the stimulating effect of tfs via positive feedback could also be conceived. for example, it is possible to consider h3k27me <dig> histone modification as a key player, as it is abundant among responsive genes with cpg islands and has the strongest association with tf-responsiveness . binding of tfs to promoters marked with h3k27me <dig> initiates the first round of transcription but subsequently removes the h3k27me <dig> histone mark because the elongating form of rna polymerase ii is known to associate with utx demethylase  <cit> . as the repressive chromatin domain shrinks, the rate of transcription increases, causing further reduction of h3k27me <dig> marks.

because this is the first study of dynamic status of gene expression, many questions remain un-answered. it would be interesting to quantify the tf-responsiveness of genes in differentiated cells and check if the same factors are associated with responsive and non-responsive genes. after elucidating the mechanisms of tf-responsiveness, we could create conditions where certain genes would be effectively activated following specific treatments, or maintain stable expression levels in fluctuating environments. finally, an understanding of dynamic gene expression profiles can help to reconstruct transcription regulatory networks because potential main nodes of this network are limited to the set of responsive genes.

CONCLUSIONS
responsiveness of gene expression to perturbations is a new way to characterize the dynamic status of genes. responsive genes mostly have regulatory functions and a tendency to become tissue-specific upon differentiation, whereas non-responsive genes are enriched in housekeeping functions. responsive genes mostly have h3k27me <dig> chromatin marks at their promoters, and non-responsive genes are associated with h3k36me <dig> chromatin, stronger tri-methylation of h3k <dig>  binding of e2f <dig>  and gabp binding motifs in promoters.
