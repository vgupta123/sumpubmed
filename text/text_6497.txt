BACKGROUND
when cells are deprived of essential nutrients, they exit the cell cycle and enter the g <dig> phase, a reversible state of cellular quiescence  <cit> . quiescence ensures survival in the face of limiting nutrients through the establishment of a stable, non-growing state and is a property of embryonic stem  cells as well as many adult stem cells, where it maintains a reservoir of cells to restore tissue integrity . the key features of quiescent g <dig> cells are the absence of dna replication, a low level of gene transcription, reduced rna content, high respiratory capacity, and the ability to re-enter the cell cycle when conditions become favorable  <cit> . characterization of the molecular signatures of quiescent stem cells has revealed several distinguishing features of the genomes of these cells. transcript profiling has shown that rna polymerase ii occupies promoter regions but not gene bodies in quiescent es cells, consistent with promoter-proximal pausing  <cit> . the serine  <dig>  phosphorylated form of the rna polymerase ii c-terminal domain  is absent in quiescent adult stem cells, indicative of the absence of transcription elongation in these cells  <cit> . epigenetic profiling has revealed that quiescent es cells contain a bivalent chromatin domain in which an activating histone modification, h <dig> lysine  <dig> tri-methylation , and a repressing modification, h <dig> lysine k <dig> tri-methylation , are simultaneously present at the promoters of many genes important for lineage specification  <cit> . in quiescent adult stem cells, the promoters of many genes, even those not being actively transcribed, are marked with h3k4me <dig>  which is considered a permissive state for transcription  <cit> . collectively, these studies have promoted the hypothesis that quiescence represents a poised state that enables rapid gene activation when g <dig> cells are stimulated to resume proliferation or to differentiate.

the functional relationship between the transcription and epigenetic states of quiescent cells is not well defined. it is also not known how these states are established during the development of quiescent cells. we addressed these issues using a budding yeast model of cellular quiescence . when glucose is naturally depleted from saccharomyces cerevisiae cells growing in rich medium, the cells undergo one slow doubling before arresting in stationary phase  <cit> . although stationary phase cells have long been considered to be quiescent, they are actually comprised of two distinct cell populations – a stable, quiescent population of non-growing g <dig> cells that can rapidly re-enter the cell cycle when glucose is restored, and an unstable, nonquiescent population that undergoes necrosis and apoptosis  <cit> . the development of a technique to separate quiescent cells from nonquiescent cells has enabled the characterization of pure populations of both mature and developing quiescent cells. this has allowed the analysis of the transcription and epigenetic profiles of quiescent cells to be defined over time in the absence of interference from the nonquiescent cell population .

similar to quiescent adult stem cells, quiescent yeast cells are non-proliferating and have low transcriptional activity . the low level of transcription is associated with global decreases in the levels of histone acetylation that occurs during the entry into quiescence, in part through the recruitment of the rpd <dig> histone deacetylase to almost half of the genes repressed by the quiescence-specific transcription factors, xbp <dig> and stb <dig>  <cit> . in this study, we investigated histone methylation associated with actively transcribed genes – methylation of histone h <dig> on lysines  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> – to determine if these modifications were also decreased in purified quiescent cells . despite the general shut down of transcription, quiescent cells retained high levels of the tri-methylated h <dig> species, h3k4me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  and h3k79me <dig>  with similar numbers of genes carrying these modifications in growing and quiescent cells. quiescent cells also had high global levels of rna polymerase ii , but only low levels of the initiating and elongating forms of rnap ii, consistent with their reduced transcriptional activity. however, a significant number of transcripts were detected in quiescent cells, with many of the transcripts representing rnas that are made in log cells and stored in rna-protein complexes in quiescent cells  <cit> . by following the transcription and histone methylation patterns on individual genes during the formation of quiescent cells, we found that at some genes the transcript and epigenetic profiles in mature quiescent cells were inherited from growing cells, while at other genes these profiles were established during early stages in the development of quiescent cells and then retained in this cell population. analysis of mutants deficient for histone methylation also suggests that specific methylation marks play distinct roles in the establishment and maintenance of the quiescent state.

RESULTS
global levels of histone methylation during the formation of quiescent cells
to investigate the histone methylation landscape during the development of quiescence, we grew yeast cells in glucose-containing rich medium and prepared lysates from cells in mid-log phase , at the point of glucose depletion , and from purified populations of quiescent  and nonquiescent  cells isolated  <dig> and 14 days after inoculation  <cit> . western blot analysis was then performed with antibodies against histones and histones modified by methylation . there was no change in the abundance of the core  or variant  histones between log cells and cells at the diauxic shift, and small decreases in the abundance of these proteins between diauxie and q or nq cells. in contrast to the global decrease in the levels of histone acetylation in both a mixed population of stationary phase cells  <cit>  and in isolated quiescent cells   <cit> , the levels of h3k <dig> di-methylation  and h3k <dig> di- and tri-methylation  were similar between log cells and purified q and nq cells . this is consistent with the report that these modified histones were present at high levels in unseparated stationary phase cells formed upon severe nutrient deprivation  <cit> . however, the levels of h3k <dig> tri-methylation  decreased by about 50% in both q and nq cells and there was a significant loss of both h3k <dig> mono- and di-methylation  in q cells compared to nq cells . in contrast, the levels of h3k <dig> trimethylation  increased at the diauxic shift and remained at a high level in both q and nq cells . thus, while q cells are distinguished from log cells by their loss of histone acetylation, they are similar to both log and diauxic cells in their retention of most forms of h <dig> methylation. q cells are further differentiated from both log and nq cells by their selective loss of h3k79me <dig> and me <dig> fig.  <dig> histone modifications in growing and quiescent cells. a. tca lysates were prepared from cells in log phase , at the diauxic shift , and in purified populations of quiescent  and nonquiescent  cells isolated  <dig> and 14 days after culture inoculation. western blots were probed with antibodies against histones and methylated histones. an empty lane between the ds samples and day- <dig> q samples was removed from the image. b western blots were probed with antibodies against h3k79me <dig>  h3k79me <dig>  and h3k79me <dig> in lysates from log cells and purified populations of q and nq cells isolated  <dig>   <dig>  and 7 days after culture inoculation. c-e lysates were prepared from log cells and purified q cells isolated at  <dig>   <dig>  and 7 days after culture inoculation and western blots were probed with  anti-myc antibodies to detect set <dig>  set <dig>  and dot1;  anti-flag antibodies to detect h2b and monoubiquitinated h2b ; and  antibodies that recognize unmodified rna polymerase ii  and the serine  <dig>  and serine  <dig>  phosphorylated forms of the rnap ii ctd. actin served as a loading control in all blots, and the images represent the results from a single time-course experiment. a representative actin blot is shown in panel a





to investigate when the levels of h3k79me <dig> and me <dig> began to decrease as q cells developed, we probed lysates prepared from pure populations of q and nq cells that were isolated at  <dig>   <dig>  and 7 days after culture inoculation . at day  <dig>  cells had completed the final cell doubling that occurs after glucose depletion, and day  <dig> represented the midpoint in the development of the fully quiescent state   <cit> . h3k79me <dig> and h3k79me <dig> were present at very low levels in day- <dig> q cells, while h3k79me <dig> levels did not significantly change in these cells throughout the sampling period . this phenotype appears to be a unique property of q cells, as the levels of h3k79me <dig>  h3k79me <dig>  and to a lesser extent, h3k79me <dig>  remained relatively unchanged in nq cells isolated during the same time course . the loss of the mono- and di-methylation states in q cells was specific to h3k <dig>  as h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  and h3k4me <dig> were present throughout q cell development . although the levels of dot <dig>  the h3k <dig> modifying enzyme, decreased in day- <dig> q cells , the selective loss of h3k79me <dig> and h3k79me <dig> in q cells suggests that either a q-specific h3k79me <dig> and h3k79me <dig> demethylase was activated, or the activity of dot <dig> was altered to promote only h3k <dig> tri-methylation. alternatively, nucleosomes that contained h3k79me <dig> or me <dig> could have been selectively replaced with unmodified h <dig> 

h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> methylation are regulated by h2b monoubiquitylation , and h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> methylation are regulated by phosphorylation of the rna polymerase ii  c-terminal domain  on serine  <dig>  or serine  <dig> , which mediate transcription initiation and elongation, respectively . these modified forms of rnap ii recruit the lysine methyltransferases, set <dig> and set <dig>  to chromatin and thus couple h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> methylation to on-going transcription. h2bub <dig> disappeared at diauxie in response to glucose depletion, as previously reported, and was absent in both q and nq cells isolated after this event   <cit> . rnap ii , tbp, and mediator subunit, srb <dig>  were present in both log and 7-day q cells, consistent with retention of the pre-initiation complex   <cit> . however, these same q cells contained only low levels of both ctd ser5-p and ctd ser2-p modified rnap ii compared to log cells . this result is similar to what has been reported in unseparated stationary phase cells  <cit> , and supports the conclusion that both transcription initiation and elongation are generally repressed in mature q cells. to determine when ser <dig> and ser <dig> ctd phosphorylation declined during q cell development, we followed the two forms of rnap ii in purified q cells isolated  <dig>   <dig>  and 7 days after culture inoculation . surprisingly, both rnap ii ser <dig> and ser <dig> phosphorylation remained at high levels in day- <dig> q cells before decreasing in abundance by day  <dig>  in contrast, set <dig> was not detected in day- <dig> q cells, and set <dig> was present at reduced levels in q cells from day- <dig> through day- <dig>  . this suggests that h3k4me2/me <dig> and h3k36me2/me <dig> were established on chromatin by the coupled activity of rnap ii and the two histone methyltransferases shortly before or soon after diauxie, and then retained in q cells in the absence of their usual regulatory signals.

genome-wide localization of histone methylation and rnap ii in quiescent cells
we defined the genome-wide distributions of h3k4me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  h3k79me <dig>  and rnap ii on chromatin isolated from 7-day q cells and compared the patterns to those found in log cells. a genome browser view of ptm occupancy across yeast chromosome iii showed similar patterns in log and q cells, with the majority of the ptm binding sites associated with gene coding regions . moreover, an unbiased analysis across the genome revealed a strong correlation in all three h <dig> methylation profiles, as well as in the unmodified h <dig> profile, between the two cell types . this is in contrast to the weak correlation in the h3k36me <dig> profile between log cells and unseparated stationary phase cells formed following complete nutrient deprivation after their transfer into water  <cit> . consistent with the genome-wide ptm profiles, log and q cells contained similar numbers of gene binding sites for the three h <dig> modifications with each individual modification enriched on at least 35% of all identified s. cerevisiae orfs . however, with the exception of h3k36me <dig>  the average enrichment of h3k4me <dig> and h3k79me <dig> on genes in q cells was lower than in log cells . this was not the result of decreased h <dig> occupancy in quiescent cells, as similar levels of h <dig> were present on chromatin in both log and q cells .fig.  <dig> genome-wide distribution of rnap ii and h <dig> methylations in growing and quiescent cells. a-e scatter plots showing correlation of rnap ii , h3k4me <dig> , h3k36me <dig> , h3k79me <dig> , and h <dig>  signals across the genome of log and 7-day q cells. f box plots showing the average enrichment of rnap ii, h3k4me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  h3k79me <dig> and h <dig> on genes in log and q cells. g venn diagrams identifying genes marked with rnap ii and the three h <dig> ptms only in log cells, only in q cells, and in both log and q cells




in contrast to the genomic profiles of the h <dig> ptms, the rnap ii genome-wide occupancy patterns in log and q cells were different in several respects. first, as previously reported, there were significant differences in the distribution of the polymerase between the two cell types , and a reduced correlation in the rnap ii profile between log and q cells   <cit> . second, q cells contained over  <dig> fewer rnap ii gene binding sites than log cells  . moreover, the mean enrichment of rnap ii on genes was also reduced in q cells, . together, the results show that while transcription is globally repressed in quiescent cells, these cells retained some features normally associated with transcriptionally active chromatin.

histone methylation and rnap ii occupancy profiles on genes in quiescent cells
we assigned the genomic h <dig> methylation and rnap ii binding sites to three subsets of genes: genes marked only in log cells , only in q cells , and in both log and q cells  . the majority of genes enriched with each h <dig> modification were common to both cell types, with a much smaller number of genes marked only in q or only in log cells . in contrast, a larger percentage of the rnap ii marked genes were log cell specific  . the log-only h <dig> methylation and rnap ii marked genes were predominantly associated with genes involved in cell growth and division, while the q-only marked genes have roles in the cellular response to stress, protein catabolism, and energy production . these go categories suggest that the ptms and rnap ii were associated with genes that are actively transcribed in each cell type or have the potential to be transcribed.

having observed that a significant number of genes were enriched for each h <dig> ptm in log and q cells, we investigated whether the gene-association patterns of the modifications were different in the two cell types. we first visualized the distribution of the h <dig> ptms across all genes in log or q cells as a function of transcript length   <cit> . in both cell types, h3k4me <dig> was present around the transcription start site  and h3k36me <dig> and h3k79me <dig> were enriched in gene bodies, consistent with previously observed patterns in growing cells  <cit> . to further assess the gene-association patterns of the ptms, we examined the averaged h <dig> methylation profiles on genes in log or q cells . in both log and q cells, h3k4me <dig> was enriched around the promoter and 5’ coding region, while h3k36me <dig> and h3k79me <dig> occupancy was restricted to the coding region. the analysis also showed a reduced overall occupancy of both h3k4me <dig> and h3k79me <dig> on genes in q cells, which was also observed in the unbiased genome-wide analysis . while the reduction in h3k4me <dig> occupancy on genes in q cells correlated with the reduced global levels of this h <dig> mark, this was not the case for h3k79me <dig>  importantly, there was no redistribution of the h <dig> marks to non-canonical locations within genes, or to intergenic regions, during the development of q cells.fig.  <dig> distribution of h <dig> methylations and rnap ii on genes in growing and quiescent cells. a the chromatra tool was used to visualize the enrichment of h3k4me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  and h3k79me <dig> in log and 7-day q cells across all transcripts sorted by their length . tss represents transcription start site, and positions upstream  and downstream  of the tss are indicated. b-e averaged gene analysis of the top 25% binding sites on genes for h3k4me <dig> ; h3k36me <dig> ; h3k79me <dig> ; and rnap ii , in log and 7-day q cells relative to the tss and transcription termination sites , with positions upstream  and downstream  of these sites indicated




in contrast to the distribution of the ptms, the enrichment of rnapii on genes was strikingly different between log and q cells . in log cells, the gene-averaged rpb3-myc profile showed rnap ii enrichment throughout the coding region and into the 3’ utr, with peak occupancy occurring around the transcription start site. in q cells, rnap ii was also enriched throughout the coding region but with several distinct differences: promoter proximal rnap ii enrichment was absent, rnap ii enrichment increased at the 3’ transcription end site , and the overall levels of gene-averaged rnap ii were lower in quiescent cells compared to log cells .

to investigate the gene association patterns of rnap ii in more detail, we defined the averaged distribution of rnap ii on genes in the three gene categories  in log and q cells . in log cells, rnap ii association with q-specific genes was significantly reduced, and similarly, there was minimal association of the polymerase with log-specific genes in quiescent cells. these results are consistent with the repression of transcription of the two groups of genes in cells where they should not be expressed. we divided the common genes into two categories: those with rnap ii enriched more highly in log cells, and those with rnap ii enriched more highly in q cells. despite the different levels of enrichment, both categories of common genes showed similar patterns of rnap ii distribution . in log cells, rnap ii was enriched on these genes in a pattern similar to that seen on log-specific genes . however, in quiescent cells, the pattern of rnap ii association with the common genes differed in two respects from that associated with log-specific genes . first, the polymerase remained associated with the common genes. second, the pattern of rnap ii association with these genes was now similar to the pattern seen on q-specific genes, showing a higher occupancy at the 3’ gene region. these data support the conclusion that there was a shift in the properties of rnap ii on the common genes during the development of quiescent cells, which could reflect changes in the dynamics of polymerase initiation and processivity during this period.

it was previously reported that rnap ii was present at a significant number of intergenic regions  in unseparated stationary phase cells, and that this association might poise a subset of genes for rapid activation upon exit from quiescence  <cit> . we re-examined this issue in purified 7-day q cells by measuring the distribution of rpb3-myc on igrs that separate divergently transcribed genes . the data showed that  <dig> % of rnap ii binding sites in q cells were associated with igrs, versus  <dig> % of these sites in log cells. in contrast, a higher percentage of gene containing regions  were associated with rnap ii in log cells  than in q cells . interestingly, the majority of igrs with bound rnap ii in both log and 7-day q cells  contained cuts, suts, mrnas involved in yeast transposon assembly and function, or transcripts from the long terminal repeat  of ty elements . moreover, the igr regions occupied by rnap ii in q cells were not present upstream of the so-called “rapid exit” category of genes  <cit> , although they did include several genes with roles in chromatin remodeling and modification. the presence of rnap ii in the promoters of this latter group of genes might play a role in resolving the compacted genome of q cells upon their re-entry into the cell cycle  <cit> . together, the data suggest that rnap ii is not poised at the majority of protein-encoding genes in q cells and that its presence in intergenic regions is related to the production of noncoding rnas.

the transcriptome of quiescent cells
while there is a large reduction in active transcription in mature quiescent cells, these cells have also been reported to contain a significant cohort of stored or sequestered rnas important for their survival  <cit> . to examine this issue in more detail, we defined the transcriptomes of both 7-day q cells and log cells using rna-seq. as previously reported, global rna levels were significantly lower in quiescent cells than in log cells, and both the overall number and abundance of specific transcripts were also reduced in q cells   <cit> . however, many rnas could still be detected in q cells , although these cells contained  <dig> fewer transcripts than log cells  . a majority of the rnas in both cell types were produced by rnap ii and fell into four main categories: coding region  rnas, cryptic unstable transcripts , stable unannotated transcripts , and small nuclear rnas    <cit> . most of the rnas were associated with orfs  and represented full-length transcripts, suggesting that they arose from a complete round of transcription. the noncoding cut rnas predominated in log cells and sut rnas were more abundant in q cells, while snrnas were present in both cell types without bias . venn analysis showed that the majority of the orf rnas were found in both cell types , with <10%  of the q cell rnas specific to quiescent cells, and 27%  of the rnas in log cells specific to this cell type . as seen for all rnas, the median level of orf rnas common to both cell types was lower in q cells than in log cells, while a more profound difference in rna levels was seen for transcripts unique to either log or q cells in quiescent or growing cells, respectively .fig.  <dig> rna content of growing and quiescent cells. a scatter plot comparing transcript abundance between log and 7-day q cells. b box plots of transcript abundance for all genes, genes common to log and q cells, and log-only and q-only genes in log and q cells. c venn analysis showing the number of orf transcripts that are unique and common in each cell type. d-g venn analysis showing the number of orf rnas associated with rnas classified as sequestered rnas in q cells  and log cells , and the number of orfs associated with rnap ii and transcripts in log cells  and q cells 




approximately 40% of the q cell orf transcripts  corresponded to the rnas that have been reported to be sequestered in protein-rna complexes in quiescent cells  <cit> , and these same rnas were also present in the log cell orf population  . we asked if there was a correlation between genes marked with rnap ii and the presence of transcripts in the two cell types. there was a stronger correlation between rnap ii and transcripts in log cells than in q cells. in log cells, 33%  of orf rnas were associated with genes that had bound rnap ii, while in q cells 19%  of orf rnas showed a similar association . together, the results support the view that a significant fraction of the rna population in q cells was transcribed from genes in log cells and stored in q cells, while a smaller fraction of the q cell rnas resulted from active transcription during the development of q cells. in support of active transcription in q cells, q cell-specific rnas were associated with genes involved with cell survival, including the response to stress, protein catabolism, and autophagy . in contrast, orf rnas found only in log cells encoded proteins dedicated to cell growth and division .

we queried genes associated with rna only in log cells or only in q cells for the occupancy of rnap ii and the three h <dig> ptms by deriving average gene profiles . the ptm profiles were very similar to the profiles derived for genes in the absence of their transcription status . however, the rnap ii profile on q genes did not show the canonical 5’ peak characteristic of active genes in log cells, although high levels of polymerase were associated with the coding region of these q genes . this suggests that these q genes underwent an earlier period of high transcriptional activity during their development, and that after the initiation of transcription was repressed, rnap ii was retained across the coding region in mature q cells.

correlation between rnap ii and h <dig> methylation in quiescent cells
the finding that many genes in q cells retained rnap ii, h3k4me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  or h3k79me <dig> raised the question of whether there was a correlation between the presence of rnap ii and the presence of the three h <dig> ptms on genes in these cells. an unbiased analysis of these factors across the genome in log cells showed a strong correlation between the presence of rnap ii and h3k4me <dig>  but little to no correlation between rnap ii and h3k36me <dig> or h3k79me <dig> . in q cells, there was a much weaker correlation between the presence of rnap ii and h3k4me <dig>  and similar to log cells, there was no correlation between rnap ii and h3k36me <dig> or h3k79me <dig> . another significant difference between log and q cells was seen in the correlation between h3k36me <dig>  h3k79me <dig> and histone h <dig>  with q cells showing a stronger correlation between the ptms and h <dig> than log cells .fig.  <dig> correlation of rnap ii and h <dig> methylation signals on genes between log and quiescent cells. a spearman correlations were derived from scatter plots comparing rnap ii, h3k4me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  h3k79me <dig>  and h <dig> signals across the genome of log and 7-day q cells. b number of genes in log and 7-day q cells co-enriched for rnap ii, h3k4me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  and h3k79me <dig> were identified from 4-way venn analysis. p-values represent fisher’s exact test




a similar scenario was seen when genes were specifically queried for the co-enrichment of rnap ii and the three species of h <dig> methylation . significantly, more genes in log cells were co-enriched for rnap ii and combinations of h3k4me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  and h3k79me <dig> than in quiescent cells, while more genes in q cells were co-enriched for the ptms in the absence of rnap ii. together, the data support the view that a large fraction of the h <dig> marks on genes in mature q cells were initially established in log phase cells or during the development of quiescence, and then retained.

gene expression and histone methylation patterns on individual genes during the development of quiescent cells
because pure populations of quiescent cells can be isolated shortly after diauxie  <cit> , this allowed us to investigate gene expression and histone methylation patterns in q cells during their development. we isolated q cells at two-day intervals after diauxie , and examined a subset of genes for the levels of transcripts they produced, and the occupancy of rnap ii and the three h <dig> ptms. we used three groups of genes for analysis: genes associated with transcripts present only in log cells, only in q cells, or in both log and q cells. distinct patterns emerged for the different classes of genes.

the log-only expressed genes, pma <dig> and cln <dig>  were associated with high levels of rnap ii, h3k4me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  h3k79me <dig>  and rna in log cells, consistent with their active transcription . however, in q cells isolated 3 days after inoculation , the levels of rna and rnap ii associated with these genes had decreased to background levels. the levels of the rnap ii ser5- and ser2-phosphorylated ctd species  also decreased at the log-only genes in the developing q cells during the same period, reflecting the shutdown of their transcription . interestingly, all three h <dig> ptms persisted at these log-only expressed genes during q cell development, albeit to varying extents: h3k4me <dig> occupancy decreased, h3k36me <dig> levels remained unchanged, and h3k79me <dig> levels increased, while no changes were noted for h <dig> occupancy . these data suggest that the marks were initially established on these genes during a period of active transcription in log cells and then retained in q cells following the cessation of transcription.fig.  <dig> transcript, rnap ii, and h <dig> methylation profiles of individual genes during the development of quiescence. log and q cells isolated at  <dig>   <dig>  and 7 days after culture inoculation were analyzed for transcript levels and rpb3-myc, h3k4me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  and h3k79me <dig> occupancy at  pma <dig>  a log cell expressed gene;  xbp <dig>  a q cell expressed gene; and  bap <dig>  a gene expressed in both cell types. transcript levels represent the change in rna abundance relative to levels in log cells. rpb3-myc and h <dig> modification occupancies were determined at the tata and 5’ or 3’ orf regions of each gene. relative occupancy represents the ip/input at each position relative to ip/input at telv  or to h <dig> ip/input . the data represent the average with std of  <dig> biological replicates




the q-only expressed genes, xbp <dig> and snz <dig>  were associated with very low levels of rnap ii, h3k4me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  h3k79me <dig>  and rna in log cells, correlating with their lack of transcription in growing cells . three days after culture inoculation , there was a dramatic and simultaneous rise in the levels of rna, rnap ii, and the h <dig> ptms associated with the two genes in the developing q cells. rnap ii occupancy then decreased over time, while h3k4me <dig>  h3k36me <dig> and h3k79me <dig> occupancies remained high. interestingly, the levels of rnap ii ctd-ser5p and ctd-ser2-p associated with the two q cell genes also peaked in day- <dig> and day- <dig> q cells before dropping to lower levels in day- <dig> q cells . this suggests that there was an extended period of time after diauxie in which these genes had high transcriptional activity, which was then followed by a gradual shut down of transcription. the data further support the view that the histone methylation marks were deposited on the q genes during this period of active transcription and retained at high levels despite the decrease in transcription.

the common genes represented the largest subset of genes associated with transcripts in both log and q cells . a comparison of the enrichment of rnap ii and the h <dig> ptms on this class of genes between log and day 7-q cells revealed that the majority of these genes showed a decrease in rnap ii, h3k4me <dig>  and h3k79me <dig> occupancy in q cells, with a less dramatic difference in h3k36me <dig> occupancy occurring between the two cell types . two common genes, bap <dig> and ole <dig>  were examined in more detail during q cell development. both genes were associated with approximately similar levels of transcripts in log and day- <dig> q cells, but showed different patterns of rnap ii occupancy during q cell development . at bap <dig>  rnap ii occupancy gradually decreased throughout the time course, similar to, but not as dramatic as the decrease in rnap ii occupancy at log-only transcribed genes . in contrast, the pattern of rnap ii occupancy at ole <dig> was more similar to the pattern seen at q-only transcribed genes, with rnap ii occupancy rising over log levels in day- <dig> q cells before falling off in day- <dig> and day- <dig> q cells . the occupancy profiles of rnap ii ctd-ser5p and ctd-ser2-p on the two common genes were also somewhat heterogeneous. however, the general picture was that their levels increased at the two common genes in day- <dig> to day- <dig> q cells before decreasing over the remainder of q cell development .

the levels of h3k36me <dig> and h3k79me <dig> at both bap <dig> and ole <dig> during q cell development remained similar to the levels seen in log cells, while the h3k4me <dig> occupancy profile at these genes was more heterogeneous . h3k4me <dig> occupancy at bap <dig> remained at log levels throughout the time-course, but h3k4me <dig> occupancy at ole <dig> dropped by ~2-fold between day- <dig> and day- <dig> q cells, similar to the global decrease in the levels of this ptm observed at the majority of common genes . together, the data suggest that the three h <dig> ptms were deposited at the common genes during an earlier period of high transcriptional activity in both log and developing q cells and then differentially retained in q cells as transcription was gradually shut down.

development and maintenance of quiescence in mutants deficient for histone methylation
to assess the biological significance of the histone methylation marks to cellular quiescence, we examined the reproductive capacity of yeast mutants deficient for h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  or h3k <dig> methylation during growth into stationary phase . we also examined the reproductive capacity of a strain deficient for h2b ubiquitylation, as this modification regulates h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> methylation. the ability of stationary phase cells to re-enter the cell cycle after prolonged glucose deprivation is a measure of chronological aging - cells with a shortened chronological lifespan  have reduced reproductive capacity, while cells with an increased chronological lifespan have enhanced reproductive capacity. cls is related to the proportion of q cells in stationary phase cultures because nq cells have a reduced ability to re-enter the cell cycle  <cit> . a wild type strain, containing an approximately equal mix of both q and nq cells, showed an ~50% reduction in reproductive capacity 4 days after diauxie. an h2b ubiquitylation mutant showed a 90% decrease in reproductive capacity during the same period, correlating with a dramatic reduction in the number of quiescent cells formed in this strain  <cit> . an h3k <dig> methylation mutant also lost reproductive capacity  <cit> , although the ability of this strain to form colonies decreased more slowly over time, so that by day- <dig> only 20% of the cells retained reproductive capacity. this decreased survival also correlated with an increased proportion of non-quiescent cells in the stationary phase culture . in contrast, the absence of h3k <dig> methylation had no effect on the ability of stationary phase cells to re-enter the cell cycle. surprisingly, an h3k <dig> methylation mutant displayed a 50% increase in colony formation after diauxie, which was then followed by a gradual drop in reproductive capacity over prolonged incubation. this striking phenotype prompted us to examine this mutant in more detail. in contrast to wild type cells, a higher proportion of quiescent cells were formed in the hht-k79a mutant . moreover, when purified wild type and hht-k79a quiescent cells were assessed for their long-term ability to survive in water, the mutant q cells showed an enhanced ability to re-enter the cell cycle . together, the data suggest that different histone methylation marks have distinct roles in the development and maintenance of the quiescent cell population, with h3k4me and h3k79me having contrasting roles in the regulation of chronological lifespan.fig.  <dig> histone modifications differentially affect the reproductive capacity of quiescent cells. a. wild type cells  and cells with mutations that abolish h2b ubiquitylation , h3k <dig> methylation , h3k <dig> methylation , or h3k <dig> methylation  were cultured in glucose-containing rich medium . samples were removed from each culture at the diauxic shift  and at various times after glucose exhaustion for up to 30 days before spreading aliquots in triplicate onto ypd plates. the results are representative of a single experiment, and show the percentage of colony forming units relative to those at day  <dig>  which was set as 100%. b separation of wild type and hht-k79a cells on a percoll gradient 7 days after inoculation into rich medium. c relative proportions of quiescent and nonquiescent cells in 7-day cultures of wild type and hht-k79a strains. d survival of wild type and hht-k79a quiescent cells incubated in water. the data represent the average with std from two independent experiments. nq, non-quiescent cell population; q, quiescent cell population




discussion
although quiescent cells are non-dividing, non-growing, and characterized by the global repression of transcription, these cells can rapidly respond to changes in their environment to resume growth and proliferation. in this study, we identified several features of yeast quiescent cells that could enable them to re-enter the cell cycle when conditions become favorable. first, quiescent cells contain a large cohort of rnas that could become available for immediate translation. second, these cells have a histone methylation landscape that is associated with transcriptionally active chromatin. third, rnap ii remains associated with many genes in mature q cells. we propose that the combined effect of these distinct features could enable quiescent cells to quickly turn-on the transcription and translation of growth promoting and proliferation genes.

transcription during the development of quiescence
the transcriptome analysis confirmed an earlier study that many gene-encoded rnas are present in quiescent cells  <cit> , although as previously reported, the total amount of rna in these cells is lower than in growing cells  <cit> . the rnas in quiescent cells include transcripts produced from q-specific genes and genes common to both log and q cells. our analysis confirmed that there is a global shift in the distribution and levels of rnap ii on chromatin in mature q cells compared to log cells  <cit> , and further showed that q cells have very low levels of both the initiating and elongating forms of the polymerase. however, we also found that after diauxie there appears to be a period of high transcriptional activity during the development of q cells, with both the initiating and elongating forms of rnap ii retained in these cells for several days . an analysis of individual genes indicated that during this period, these active forms of rnap ii were associated with both q-specific and common genes . this association corresponded to the rapid rise in rna produced from q-specific genes and could account for the continued transcription of the common genes as log cells transitioned from diauxie to quiescence. in contrast, active rnap ii was lost from log-only genes soon after glucose deprivation at diauxie, corresponding to their transcriptional repression. this suggests that as quiescent cells develop, there is a period in which rnap ii is simultaneously active at some genes  and inactive at others . many of the transcripts produced during this period of activity then become stored or stabilized in mature quiescent cells and could promote their survival or re-entry into the cell cycle.

although it was previously reported that in unseparated 7-day stationary phase cells rnap ii was poised at intergenic regions that are upstream of genes with roles in the rapid exit from quiescence  <cit> , this bias was not observed in purified 7-day q cells. instead, in these mature q cells, rnap ii was uniformly distributed across the coding region of both q-specific and common genes and showed increased accumulation around the transcription end site , which is the opposite profile to what was seen for rnap ii in actively growing cells . moreover, this pattern was maintained in mature q cells on genes that were only associated with rnas in these cells . thus, with the exception of genes expressed only in log cells, ongoing transcription may not be completely shut-off at the bulk of genes occupied by rnap ii in quiescent cells. instead, the behavior of rnap ii may change during the development of quiescence, such that a lower frequency of transcription initiation, coupled with altered rnap ii processivity across the gene coding region, results in the peak of polymerase observed near the tes. alternatively, the polymerase may not be actively engaged in transcription but retained on genes in q cells as the consequence of aberrant polymerase release during transcription termination, which correlates with the presence of low levels of rnap ii ser2-p ctd in the q cell population. altered termination could in turn inhibit transcription initiation, thereby forming a self-reinforcing feedback loop that ultimately down regulates transcription in q cells.

chromatin in quiescent cells is associated with active histone methylation marks
it was previously reported that chromatin in q cells is transcriptionally repressed as a consequence of the combined effects of increased nucleosome density and histone hypoacetylation at the tss and coding region of many genes  <cit> . however, we found the histone modification landscape of quiescent cells is also notable for the retention of three histone methylation marks - h3k4me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  and h3k79me <dig> - that are associated with transcriptionally active chromatin. interestingly, these marks are also retained on the chromatin of unseparated stationary phase cells formed upon complete nutrient deprivation following transfer of cells into water  <cit> , suggesting that they generally define the chromatin structure of non-growing cells. unlike rnap ii, each of the h <dig> ptms occupied similar locations on genes in growing and quiescent cells. h3k4me <dig> was present at the promoter and 5’ region of many genes in q cells and could poise these genes for the initiation of transcription upon glucose restoration, similar to its postulated role at the promoters of genes in quiescent mammalian stem cells  <cit> . the coding regions of genes in quiescent cells also contained high levels of h3k36me <dig> and h3k79me <dig>  marks associated with transcription elongation  <cit> . these modifications might also create a chromatin environment permissive for transcription under conditions that promote growth. alternatively, rather than poising genes for activation, the marks might reinforce transcriptional repression in quiescent cells by recruiting hdacs or inhibiting histone exchange, two properties ascribed to the presence of h3k36me <dig> in gene coding regions in growing cells  <cit> . the modifications might play other roles as well, such as providing a chromatin template that is more permissive for dna damage repair in quiescent cells, a feature associated with h3k <dig> methylation in growing cells  <cit> .

the three ptms were associated with all three categories of genes in quiescent cells - q-specific genes, genes common to log and q cells, and log-specific genes. however, the mechanisms accounting for their presence on these genes might be different. it is likely that h3k4me <dig> was placed on q-specific genes through its coupling to transcription during the post-diauxic period when rnap ii remains active. because many common genes may continue to be transcribed during the same period, this could also account for the presence of h3k4me <dig> on this group of genes. alternatively, the mark might be placed on both the common genes and log-specific genes during transcription in log cells, and then retained on these genes during the development of q cells. the decreased correlation of h3k4me <dig> with rnap ii on genes in q cells, along with the significant reduction in set <dig> levels in post-diauxic cells, supports the latter scenario . it is unclear how h3k4me <dig> is retained on genes during the development of quiescence. in actively growing cells, it has been shown that h3k <dig> acetylation  is required for the maintenance of global h3k4me <dig> levels via a mechanism whereby h3k14ac blocks the activity of the jhd <dig> histone demethylase, which predominantly targets h3k4me <dig> for removal  <cit> . however, in q cells, h3k4me <dig> is retained on genes in the absence of h3k14ac . although transcripts from genes encoding h <dig> demethylating enzymes are present in q cells at levels equivalent to or even higher than those in log cells , it is not known if these enzymes are in fact present in q cells. alternatively, it is conceivable that the condensed chromatin structure of quiescent cells could inhibit their access to the modifications.

in contrast to h3k4me <dig>  there was only a weak association between the presence of h3k36me <dig> and rnap ii in either log or q cells . instead, h3k36me <dig> correlated with h <dig>  with a significantly stronger correlation seen in quiescent cells . moreover, the levels of h3k36me <dig> on genes in both cell types were approximately the same . one interpretation of these results is that h3k36me <dig> marked nucleosomes, both those formed on q-specific genes during the post-diauxic period and on the larger cohort of log-specific and common genes in log cells, were retained in developing q cells as a consequence of decreased replication-dependent or –independent nucleosome turnover, coupled with the absence of demethylation. interestingly, h3k4me <dig> levels on the large group of log-specific and common genes decreased approximately 2-fold in quiescent cells , which could be the consequence of dilution through replacement with unmodified h <dig> during the post-diauxic period. this suggests that h3k36me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> marked nucleosomes might be differentially turned over as quiescent cells develop. in support of this view, there was no correlation between the presence of h3k36me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> or between h3k4me <dig> and h <dig> across the genome in either log or q cells .

like h3k4me <dig> and h3k36me <dig>  h3k79me <dig> is retained on the majority of genes in quiescent cells. however, unlike h3k4me <dig> and h3k36me <dig>  h3k79me <dig>  is lost after diauxie . in contrast, all three h3k <dig> methyl species are present in nonquiescent cells. there is no known h3k <dig> demethylase that can counteract the dot <dig> methyltransferase. however, it has been reported that h3k79me <dig> preferentially accumulates on “old” h <dig> proteins, which represent histones with a low-turnover rate  <cit> . the lengthy dna replication cycle that occurs after diauxie suggests that the shift to h3k79me <dig> could be a consequence of the increased residence time of histones during this stage of q cell development. an interesting corollary is that “old” h3-h <dig> tetramers might be preferentially segregated to q cells that are formed during this period of dna replication. alternatively, a decreased rate of replication-independent histone turnover in these cells might also provide an increased pool of old h <dig> on which h3k79me <dig> is enriched. together, the data suggest that the dynamics of histone turnover during the post-diauxic period might underlie the retention of all three h <dig> ptms on genes in quiescent cells.

histone modifications differentially regulate cellular quiescence
the contrasting phenotypes exhibited by histone mutants deficient for the various ptms when grown into stationary phase suggests that each histone modification has distinct roles in the establishment or maintenance of cellular quiescence. the decreased number of q cells formed in mutants deficient for h2bub <dig> suggests a role for this modification in promoting q cell formation, potentially by preventing apoptosis from occurring in daughter cells  <cit> . conversely, the increase in the proportion of q cells formed in the absence of h3k <dig> methylation and the ability of the mutant quiescent cells to survive longer under conditions of extreme nutrient deprivation, suggest a role for this modification in promoting apoptosis in mother cells. in wild type cells, the natural loss of h2b ubiquitylation and the shift to h3k79me <dig> marked nucleosomes might together act as signals for the post-diauxic cell cycle arrest and entry into quiescence  <cit> .

in contrast to the loss of h2b ubiquitylation or h3k <dig> methylation, the loss of h3k <dig> methylation had no apparent effect on the formation or reproductive capacity of quiescent cells and thus does not influence chronological aging. interestingly, mutations that eliminate h3k <dig> methylation result in a shorter replicative life span in yeast as the result of a decrease in transcriptional fidelity in aging cells  <cit> . mutations that affect h3k <dig> methylation also decrease replicative life span  <cit> , but have the opposite effect during chronological aging by promoting the formation of quiescent daughter cells. the contrasting effects of histone post-translational modifications on replicative and chronological life span suggest that different epigenetic mechanisms are used to control these two modes of cellular aging.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, quiescent yeast cells have molecular signatures that could ensure their long-term survival and ability to re-enter the cell cycle. these signatures include the presence of multiple transcripts encoding proteins important for growth and cell division, a histone modification landscape that favors new rounds of transcription, and a distinctive pattern of rnap ii occupancy across gene coding regions in quiescent cells. these signatures appear to be established both in growing cells and during the development of quiescent cells. as a consequence, similar to quiescent human stem cells, quiescent yeast cells are not inert, but appear highly poised to resume growth and proliferation when the environment becomes favorable.
