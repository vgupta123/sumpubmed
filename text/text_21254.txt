BACKGROUND
insects are among the most successful animal life forms on earth in terms of species richness and abundance. like all other living organisms they are under permanent threat of infection by harmful microorganisms.

insects are not endowed with an adaptive immune system and must rely entirely on innate immune mechanisms or externally applied immune defences  <cit> . invading microorganisms that break the primary passive protective barriers such as the cuticle or the peritrophic membrane in the gut encounter immediate-acting defence strategies such as phagocytic cells, phenoloxidase activity and reactive oxygen species. as a second line of defence a powerful antimicrobial immune response is mounted, mainly based on amps but also including serine proteases, stress factors and factors involved in opsonisation and clotting  <cit> . based on several structural features, the amps can be classified into several groups such as α-helical peptides, glycine-rich peptides, cysteine-rich peptides or proline-rich peptides  <cit> .

detection of microbial invaders is achieved by pattern recognition receptors  which recognise conserved structural motifs of the microorganisms such as dap- or lys-containing pgn of respectively gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . the conserved molecular patterns of the microbes they recognise are called microbe associated molecular patterns   <cit> . these prrs then interact with cellular signalling systems such as toll, imd, jak-stat, and jnk pathways, which ultimately lead to the activation of an immune response  <cit> . early work on the drosophila melanogaster immune system already revealed striking similarities of these signal transduction pathways with those of vertebrates. for instance, the identification of the drosophila toll receptor was a milestone discovery, since later it was found that related prrs of vertebrates, the so-called toll-like receptors, also play a dominant role in the innate immune system of vertebrates  <cit> .

here we characterise the immune system of the carpenter ant c. floridanus. these ants live in huge colonies of genetically highly related animals. the high density of closely related individuals within the nest may pose specific hygiene problems since pathogen transfer may be facilitated by the close contact of colony members. on the other hand, social insects have evolved many additional hygienic measures on the colony level which may improve health of the individuals, such as cleaning behaviours or the use of other external immune defences such as the application of antimicrobial secretions, a phenomenon termed ‘social immunity’  <cit> . thus, not only the canonical genes encoding amps or factors involved in signalling pathways but also genes encoding traits involved in external or social immune defences should be viewed as part of the immune system of a social insect  <cit> . for example, le conte and co-workers discovered several genes which might contribute to social immunity in honey bees  <cit> . a striking new finding was reported recently for the closely related ant c. pennsylvanicus, in which a cathepsin d like protease was found to be transmitted to other ants by trophallaxis, leading to an increased infection resistance in the recipients  <cit> . the first genome sequence of a social insect, the honey bee, revealed an apparently low number of genes with immune-related functions as compared to solitary insects  <cit> . accordingly, it was suggested that external immune defences including social immunity may have alleviated selection pressure from the canonical innate immune factors as internal and external immune defences may trade off against each other. however, the recent honey bee genome upgrade identified about  <dig> more protein encoding genes than previously reported, which need to be analysed carefully in the future  <cit> . in addition, the genome sequences of several other hymenopteran and dipteran species reveal that dipterans appear to have an unusually high number of immune genes and that a social lifestyle may not directly correlate with this number  <cit> .

a specific feature of c. floridanus is its obligate interaction with an intracellular mutualistic y-proteobacterium, blochmannia floridanus, which resides in midgut cells and in the ovaries and supplements nutrients to its host  <cit> . the host recognises the endosymbiont as non-self and the immune system can therefore play a role in maintenance and regulation of the chronic infection by the endosymbiont  <cit> , while on the other side it has to defeat pathogenic microorganisms, thus possibly requiring specific adaptations of its immune system  <cit> . for instance, previous work revealed a localised down-modulation of the immune response that is restricted to the midgut tissue of the ants and correlates with massive replication of the endosymbiont in this tissue  <cit> .

to get insight into the immune system of the carpenter ant and to unravel possible specific adaptations to its lifestyle as a social insect living in an obligate mutualistic interaction with a bacterial endosymbiont, we re-evaluated the data available from the recently published genomic sequence of c. floridanus  <cit>  and extended this dataset with genome-wide transcriptome data generated from animals with or without previous immune challenge. to identify and functionally annotate the key players of the c. floridanus immune response and to determine the interactions among these players, we performed a detailed analysis including sequence and domain analysis and pathway annotation . transferring annotation of proteins at a domain level allows more accurate functional inference  <cit>  and is useful for predicting the function of multi-domain proteins  <cit>  and novel domain combinations that possibly give rise to new protein functions  <cit> . furthermore, we compared the c. floridanus immune genes and pathways to other recently sequenced ant genomes including acromyrmex echinatior, atta cephalotes, cerapachys biroi, harpegnathos saltator, linipithema humile, pogonomyrmex barbatus, solenopsis invicta . we used clusters of orthologous genes and protein families  for many of the above-mentioned comparisons and thus the comparisons based on these entities are quite broad. nevertheless, regarding the number of complete genomes available there are limitations for drawing general conclusions. moreover, other hymenoptera such as the honey bee a. mellifera  <cit> , the solitary parasitic wasp nasonia vitripennis  <cit> , and, as a model organism, d. melanogaster  <cit> , served to investigate possible differences in the immune system of endosymbiont-bearing, eu-social and solitary insects.

RESULTS
c. floridanus genome structure and re-annotation
to establish the immune repertoire of c. floridanus the full transcriptome was analysed by illumina sequencing, comparing challenged and unchallenged animals . sequencing resulted in  <dig> , <dig> reads for immune-challenged and  <dig> , <dig> reads for untreated animals. sequence statistics of illumina sequencing are listed in table  <dig>  the first c. floridanus genome annotation  contains  <dig>  protein-coding genes  <cit> . the updated version of the previous annotation is labelled as cflo_ogsv <dig>  . compared with the previously published annotation of the c. floridanus genome, the optimised augustus software with species-specific parameters applied here predicted  <dig>  protein-coding genes based on data from c. floridanus expressed sequence tags  and the large-scale illumina sequencing data  presented here. our revised annotation counts fewer genes and an increase in the number of multi-exon genes as compared to the published version v <dig> . the accuracy of annotation for both was improved using the latest version of the gene prediction tool augustus v <dig> . furthermore, over-prediction  of single exon genes was reduced by this software. the improved quality of the annotation was further validated as  <dig>   predicted transcripts could now be supported by extrinsic evidence such as introns and exons hints generated by sources such as illumina sequence data and ests. the new annotation predicts a total of  <dig>  proteins as compared to  <dig>  proteins in the previous version v <dig> . we found  <dig> genes with two or more alternative transcripts. the optimised parameters with  <dig>  % exon level accuracy allowed the improvement of annotation of the c. floridanus genome , e.g. with regard to splicing events. the prediction accuracy of augustus with the new optimised parameters is tabulated in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the optimised parameters are provided as part of the latest augustus package . bonasio and co-workers  detected  <dig> alternative splicing events in  <dig> genes  overall, while our analysis revealed  <dig> genes affected by alternative splicing events coding for  <dig> alternative transcripts . however, the ogsv <dig>  data available for c. floridanus contain  <dig>  transcripts and  <dig>  proteins without distinction between alternative isoforms and thus cannot be used for further analysis. the new data reported here can be accessed at our web repository  and distinguish the alternative splicing products of the genes with the suffix in the accession number as t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> etc. the exact distribution of alternative transcripts over the annotated  <dig>  genes is listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> table  <dig> quantitative overview on the transcriptome sequencing data



we compared the improved genome annotation of c. floridanus to published data on other genomes, showing that c. floridanus has fewer repetitive elements  than d. melanogaster  or n. vitripennis , but more than a. mellifera . using the major database of repetitive elements, repbase  <cit> , we list  <dig> specific repetitive elements for the c. floridanus genome and we give a summary of these elements in table  <dig>  based on a de novo repeat library constructed with the repeatmodeler programme we detected  <dig> repetitive elements in the c. floridanus genome. with the assembled repeat library,  <dig>  % of the c. floridanus genome was identified to contain repetitive sequences, consisting of  <dig>  % of interspersed repeat elements,  <dig>  % of simple repeats,  <dig>  % low complexity stretches, and  <dig>  % of small rnas and satellites .

functional annotation and classification
in comparison to the previous c. floridanus genome annotation  we found  <dig> more proteins with functional domains . these protein sequences were further analysed with regards to their function. the total number of additional proteins identified was higher but not all of them contained functional domains. we further compared the changes in level- <dig> go annotations in all three go categories, i.e. biological process, molecular function and cellular component. as expected, based on best hits of sequence-based similarity searches we found that the c. floridanus sequences are generally most closely related to recently sequenced ant species . furthermore, we examined their overall functions. among the  <dig>  proteins, the software blast2go assigned level  <dig> go terms to  <dig> proteins and stressed important functions . regarding the term “biological process” , various “cellular processes”  were most abundant , regarding “molecular function” , enzymes presented the highest fraction among the proteins , directly followed by “binding” with 39 %. regarding “cellular compartment” the subcategory “cell” with  <dig>  % was found to be most abundant . however, consider that two thirds of the proteins are located in membranes, organelles or part of macromolecular complexes . in total  <dig> proteins of cflo could be annotated by blast2go. the proportion of cflo proteins annotated previously falling into each functional category is shown in additional file 4: figure s <dig>  comparing our functional annotation with cflo in terms of go classification, we note an increase of  <dig> to 23 % regarding successful subcategory assignments covering all three major go categories  for “biological process”;  <dig> terms versus  <dig> in “molecular function”, and  <dig> terms versus  <dig> terms respectively for the go category “cellular component”; additional file 5: table s3). in conclusion, by refining the accuracy of prediction regarding single and multiple transcript genes and evidence for their expression the transcriptome sequencing improved the annotation of the c. floridanus proteome, the identification of repetitive elements as well as alternative splicing predictions.fig.  <dig> distribution of closest related sequences to c. floridanus proteins. all proteins within the ncbi nr database  were analysed using the sequence comparison tool blast  <cit>  with an e-value cut-off of 1e- <dig>  the best sequence-similar hit of each re-annotated c. floridanus sequence was used for the analysis

comparison of the immune gene repertoire of c.floridanus with different insect species
we present the c. floridanus immunome using sequence-based protein orthology with the previously published data of d. melanogaster, a. mellifera and n. vitripennis assuming their functions and modes of action are conserved . c. floridanus shares  <dig> orthologs with n. vitripennis,  <dig> orthologs with d. melanogaster, and  <dig> with a. mellifera. all four species share  <dig> immune protein orthologs which mostly comprise proteins involved in core immune signalling pathways, prrs or serine proteases . overall, in accordance with previous findings  <cit>  signalling pathways seem to be more conserved in comparison to effector molecules that show higher levels of taxon specificity. we classified the  <dig> immune related genes of c. floridanus identified here into several categories including microbial recognition, signalling pathways , amps, phagocytosis, melanisation, encapsulation, cytoskeleton immune proteins, antiviral defence, coagulation, haematopoiesis and other immune responses . in the additional file 7: table s <dig> the accession numbers and annotations of all categorised immune proteins of c. floridanus are listed.fig.  <dig> immune gene repertoire of c. floridanus shared with different insect species. the venn diagram shows the number of immune protein orthologs  of c. floridanus shared with d. melanogaster, n. vitripennis and a. mellifera


fig.  <dig> functions of immune-related genes of c. floridanus. the pie chart shows the percentage of immune genes  in each functional sub-category relative to the entire set of immune genes. the category ’immune signalling components’ is further divided into different pathways



signal transduction via major immune signalling pathways
recognition of a pathogen is the first step in promoting an efficient immune response. therefore, pattern recognition receptors  recognise the so-called mamps such as bacterial pgn or fungal beta- <dig> -glucans  <cit> . upon binding to microbial components they trigger the activation of signal transduction systems either directly or after a series of proteolytic events mediated by serine proteases, ultimately resulting in the activation of antimicrobial defence mechanisms including the expression of amps  <cit> . due to the in-depth knowledge and functional assays of its major immune signalling pathways  <cit>  we used d. melanogaster as a template to identify components of the toll, imd, jak-stat, and jnk signal transduction pathways in c. floridanus. the reconstructed immune related signalling repertoire of c. floridanus is highly conserved and largely similar to the signalling components identified by experiments mainly conducted with drosophila  <cit> .

toll signalling pathway
the toll pathway of insects is mainly activated by fungal pathogens and gram-positive bacteria. the toll pathway not only regulates the antimicrobial response but is also required for proper haemocyte proliferation  <cit> . therefore, toll activation leads to a coordinated immune response that comprises both cellular and humoral immunity  <cit> . the toll signalling pathway was found to be highly conserved in terms of the presence of homologs in c. floridanus . recognition of lys-type pgn characteristic for most gram-positive bacteria or of fungal beta- <dig> -glucans by specific prrs leads to the activation of proteolytic cascades which finally activate the toll-dependent signalling cascade. in c. floridanus three prrs likely feeding into the toll pathway are found: a pgrp-sa  which according to sequence homology probably recognises lys-type pgn, and two proteins annotated as beta- <dig> -glucan binding proteins  with high homologies to both gnbp <dig> and gnbp <dig> of d. melanogaster. gnbp <dig> is known to perceive lys-type pgn, while gnbp <dig> recognises fungal cell wall components  <cit> . the homology data of the c. floridanus proteins do not allow a clear identification of the signal sensed by the two gnbps. however, the previous expression data acquired post immune challenge of c. floridanus with gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria revealed a long-lasting up-regulation of the gene encoding one of the gnbps  only after infection with gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . this suggests that this camponotus protein may be able to recognise lys-type pgn and thus may be a functional homolog of gnbp <dig> of d. melanogaster . in addition, c. floridanus encodes a homolog of the protease persephone which was previously shown to be involved in the detection of danger signals indicative for infection with gram-positive bacteria and fungi  <cit> . in d. melanogaster the toll pathway is triggered upon microbially induced proteolytic cleavage of the circulating cytokine-like ligand molecule spätzle that binds to the toll receptor, thus finally leading to the nuclear translocation of the nf-κb-like transcription factors dorsal and dif . a single gene encoding dorsal is present in c. floridanus, but similar to a.mellifera no ortholog of dif was found. this is in agreement with the recent suggestion that dif belongs to a highly derived branch possibly found only in brachyceran flies  <cit> . therefore, in c. floridanus dorsal appears to be the unique transcription factor required for induction of amps during the toll mediated immune response.fig.  <dig> the toll signalling pathway of c. floridanus. all identified signalling components are mapped on the comprehensive immune network of d. melanogaster. the names of the factors correspond to the drosophila designations. connectivity among nodes is based either on positive attribute  or negative attribute . missing components are shown in grey colour. nuclear translocation is shown by a green arrow. factors significantly upregulated on the transcriptional level upon immune-challenge are shown by green boxes



imd and jnk signalling pathways
the activation of the imd pathway of insects is triggered after infection predominantly by gram-negative bacteria and is also involved in the induction of expression of amps  <cit> . c. floridanus harbours the gram-negative obligate intracellular endosymbiont b. floridanus and it was suggested that the imd pathway may also contribute to control and tolerance of the endosymbiont  <cit> . the present data show that most components of the imd pathway are present in c. floridanus . however, in c. floridanus dap-type pgn mainly characteristic for gram-negative bacteria is recognised via a single signal-transducing prr, originally annotated as pgrp-le, while the organism appeared to lack pgrp-lc-like receptors. the careful re-evaluation of the genomic data revealed, however, that this protein has a much longer n-terminal sequence and comprises a transmembrane domain at sequence position  <dig> to  <dig>  in fact, a cluster analysis revealed that the protein is more related to pgrp-lc sequences of d. melanogaster and a. mellifera than to pgrp-le of d. melanogaster. thus, the c. floridanus protein is likely to be a pgrp-lc homolog  and appears to be the only receptor for dap-type pgn that activates the imd pathway. in addition, two pgn recognition proteins with regulatory function  were previously found  <cit> . due to the presence of an amidase domain both of them may down-modulate the signal transduction pathways by cleavage of pgn  <cit> . in fact, pgrp-lb was recently found to be implicated in the tolerance towards the obligate intracellular endosymbiont b. floridanus in the midgut tissue during pupation of the animals. prgp-lb is highly up-regulated only in the midgut tissue and not in other parts of the pupa body cavity, coinciding with a massive multiplication of the endosymbiont and a reduction of the immune competence in this tissue  <cit> .fig.  <dig> the imd and jnk pathways of c. floridanus. all identified signalling components are mapped on the comprehensive immune network of d. melanogaster. the names of the factors correspond to the drosophila designations. connectivity among nodes is based either on positive attribute  or negative attribute . missing components are shown in grey colour. nuclear translocation is shown by a green arrow. factors significantly upregulated on the transcriptional level upon immune-challenge are shown by green boxes



a major difference with regard to d. melanogaster in the cytosolic c. floridanus imd signalling cascade concerns the so-called ikk complex which activates the nf-κb-like transcription factor relish by phosphorylation  <cit> . in drosophila the ikk complex is composed of the enzymatically active ird <dig> subunit and the regulatory subunit kenny. however, in c. floridanus the regulatory subunit is missing. it has been published that a kenny mutant of d. melanogaster is highly susceptible to bacterial infections  <cit> . iterative sequence analyses also verified the lack of the kenny subunit in a. mellifera, n. vitripennis and other ant species, suggesting a common character of the ikk complex in hymenoptera. whether the lack of the kenny subunit may reflect a reduction in the immune potential of hymenoptera or whether so far unknown factors may be involved in building a functional ikk complex is not yet known.

the imd pathway also leads to tak <dig>  mediated activation of the jnk signalling cascade  <cit> . jnk signalling contributes to regulation of many developmental processes  <cit> , wound healing  <cit> , activation of stress-protective proteins  <cit> , inflammatory  <cit>  and cellular immune responses  <cit> . the data reported here indicate that the jnk pathway in c. floridanus is quite similar to the pathway in d. melanogaster, since most of the core components of the jnk pathway of d. melanogaster have homologs in c. floridanus .

additional receptor proteins and jak-stat signalling pathway
besides the above mentioned prrs, we also identified proteins known to be involved in pathogen recognition and/or promotion of phagocytosis including scavenger receptors, croquemort family members, nimrod and draper orthologs, vitellogenin, galectins, c-type lectins, brain angiogenesis inhibitor  <dig> , fibrinogen-related protein, down syndrome cell adhesion molecular  and thioester containing proteins . the latter are known to play a role in the jak-stat pathway, which contributes to stem cell regulation in the intestine of drosophila and thus to midgut homeostasis  <cit> . in c. floridanus all core components of the jak-stat pathway are present  except extracellular ligand proteins identified in drosophila, which activate the pathway and which are also not found in other insects, including the honey bee  <cit> . while teps and turandot proteins are among the downstream effectors of the jak-stat pathway in d. melanogaster  <cit> , similar to a. mellifera no homologs of turandot proteins were identified by blastp searches in c. floridanus, but several teps were found. teps may play a role in insect immunity by promoting phagocytosis of bacteria  <cit> . most teps share the common cgeq motif defining the thioester site, which allows the formation of a covalent bond to microbial surfaces  <cit> . however, several teps in insects lack the thioester motif, but these teps may act as adaptors for the initiation of the membrane attack complex as is found in vertebrate complement factors  <cit> . sequence analyses revealed the presence of three tep genes  in c. floridanus, with tep <dig> and tep <dig> containing the cgeq motif in the deduced amino acid sequences. for the gene encoding tep <dig>  two alternative transcripts were found . interestingly, only the cgeq motif containing tep <dig> of c. floridanus is up-regulated upon immune challenge .fig.  <dig> the jak-stat pathway of c. floridanus. all identified signalling components are mapped on the comprehensive immune network of d. melanogaster. the names of the factors correspond to the drosophila designations. connectivity among nodes is based either on positive attribute  or negative attribute . missing components are shown in grey colour. nuclear translocation is shown by a green arrow. factors significantly upregulated on the transcriptional level upon immune-challenge are shown by green boxes



antimicrobial peptides of c. floridanus and other hymenoptera
the previous analysis of the c. floridanus genome revealed a relatively low number of known amps including two defensins, a hymenoptaecin, a tachystatin-like and a crustin-like peptide . these peptides are also encoded by most of the other ants  <cit> , however, the distribution pattern of amps is in general quite complex . for example, several of the ants including c. floridanus lack a gene encoding abaecin, while other ants encode this amp. thus, similar to the previously described gain, loss and duplication of defensin genes  <cit> , there is quite an extensive variability in the presence and number of antimicrobial peptide genes in the ant genomes . much alike in the honeybee, the number of predicted or confirmed amps appears to be relatively low in ants as compared to the solitary wasp n. vitripennis for which  <dig> amps were described  <cit> . the apparently low number of amps may be compensated by the astonishing gene structure of hymenoptaecin which in the ants is encoded as a huge precursor protein with several repeated hymenoptaecin domains. proteolytic maturation of this precursor protein leads to a massive amplification of the immune response  <cit> . in addition, the hymenoptaecin gene is among the most strongly induced genes after immune challenge . the apparently quite low number of amps and of pgn recognising prrs as described above may relate to the social lifestyle of ants and bees as compared to the solitary and parasitic lifestyle of the wasp n. vitripennis, since social life might allow hygienic measures on the colony level  <cit> . in addition, ants produce a range of antimicrobial secretions that may be used to reduce pathogen pressure externally before an infection of the body occurs. as a consequence these external immune defence strategies may trade off against internal immune defences and may result in a reduction in the number of effector molecules  <cit> .table  <dig> antimicrobial peptides of c. floridanus and other hymenoptera

4)nabaecin of n. vitripennis is considered as a member of the abaecin family. however, nabaecins belong to different orthologous cluster; therefore we separated nabaecins and abaecins



prophenoloxidase, serine proteases and serpins
several immune defence reactions in insects such as phagocytosis, melanisation and nodulation depend on phenoloxidase  activity . during the melanisation process toxic intermediates such as reactive oxygen species  may kill microbial invaders directly. since phenoloxidase activity can also harm insect cells the enzyme is synthesised as an inactive precursor . pro-po activation involves microbial recognition by prrs and proteolytic cascades involving terminal serine proteases that finally cleave pro-po to its active form  <cit> . serpins negatively control the activity of po and help to avoid overshooting melanisation and dangerous ros production  <cit> . phenoloxidases are related to arylphorins, hemocyanins and hexamerins  <cit> . using query sequences from four insect species, blastp searches resulted in eight significant hits. the first hit corresponds to the c. floridanus prophenoloxidase , while the other hits are distributed among hemocyanin, arylphorin and hexamerin sequences. thus, a single prophenoloxidase gene appears to be present in the c. floridanus genome.

in addition, we annotated  <dig> serine proteases and ten serine protease inhibitors in c. floridanus  using the autofact v <dig>  tool for functional annotation of gene models  <cit> . among these are five putative immune related serine proteases and four serine protease inhibitors including one serpin that showed differential expression profiles after immune challenge .

chitinases, glutathione-s-transferases and nitric oxide synthase 
enzymes with chitinase activity play an important role in the immune defence of insects by catalysing the breakdown of chitin, a linear polymer found in fungal pathogen cell walls consisting of β-1- <dig> linked n-acetylglucosamine  <cit> . four conserved motifs  have been reported in catalytic domains of insect chitinases  <cit> . five prototypic chitinases from different insect species served as a standard for detection . in c. floridanus we found putative  <dig> chitinases containing a variable number of the four conserved sequence motifs . only two predicted proteins are endowed with all four chitinase signature motifs, while in five sequences no such motif was detected. overall, there is not much variation in the number of chitinase genes encoded by the different insect species compared here .

glutathione s-transferases  comprise a diverse family of dimeric enzymes that have attracted attention in insects because of their involvement in the defence towards insecticides  <cit> . cytosolic gsts in insects have been assigned to six classes including delta, epsilon, omega, sigma, theta and zeta  <cit> , and among them the delta and epsilon classes represent over 65 % of the total gst expansions. a recent phylogenetic study of insect gsts suggested the evolution of the epsilon class from the delta class  <cit> . we predicted several c. floridanus gsts that were classified into different classes on the basis of their sequence similarities and phylogenetic relationships with other insect species. based on these approaches,  <dig> out of  <dig> identified c. floridanus gsts were assigned to five different classes, including three in omega, three in sigma, one in each of delta, theta and zeta and one unclassified gst . the absence of epsilon class gsts in c. floridanus is in line with their absence in other hymenoptera  <cit> . with the exception of d. melanogaster encoding  <dig> gsts, there are only minor differences in the number of gsts encoded by the other insects  .

nos belongs to the family of enzymes which form nitric oxide  from l-arginine and makes important contributions to the imd pathway in activation of relish, since nos activity is required for a robust innate immune response to gram-negative bacteria in drosophila  <cit> . in c. floridanus only a single gene  codes for a protein that matched all criteria of a nos. with the exception of a. cephalotes and n. vitripennis each encoding two nos, the other ants and a. mellifera code for a single nos .

identification of genes differentially expressed  after immune challenge
in the previous sections immune genes were identified mainly based on their similarity to already described immune genes of other insects. to further strengthen this analysis and to identify additional factors possibly involved in immune reactions, the transcriptome analysis presented here was performed with immune challenged and untreated animals . genes found to be regulated by immune challenge are likely to be involved in immune functions, although it is known that there are many regulatory overlaps with stress responses other than immune challenge  <cit> . we used two different programmes to evaluate differentially expressed genes between these samples. the combination of the results from cuffdiff  and deseq  allowed the identification of  <dig> transcripts, which were significantly differentially expressed in response to bacterial challenge. to show at the same time amount of change and statistical significance, volcano plots summarise the results . table s <dig>  lists all genes that were up- or down-regulated by at least a factor of  <dig> including their annotation and log fold change expression value. among the differentially expressed transcripts, ~20 % of transcripts were identified to code for known immune related proteins or proteins described to be differentially regulated after immune challenge in other insects. the percentage of immune-related genes in the genome is quite low. according to the functional categories shown in fig.  <dig> only  <dig>  % of genes are related to immune processes. even when taking into account the limits of the accuracy of functional categories, all other signalling processes together encompass only  <dig>  % of all genes. hence, there is enrichment for immune related genes regarding the much higher percentage within all differentially regulated genes. genes up-regulated after immune challenge encode well known immune related genes including those that encode prrs and serine proteases , proteins involved in signalling and transcription , nf-kappa-b inhibitor , as well as stress-related proteins such as cytochromes p <dig> fig.  <dig> gene expression changes after immune challenge. volcano plots show the statistical significance of the difference in expression observed . the x-axis indicates the differential expression profiles, plotting the fold-induction ratios in a log- <dig> scale during immune challenge. the list of significantly differentially expressed protein coding genes can be found in table s <dig> . a volcano plot from cuffdiff data. up-regulated genes  are shown as blue dots and the down-regulated genes  are shown as orange dots. the top three protein coding genes most up-regulated are cflo_n_g <dig> , cflo_n_g <dig>  and cflo_n_g <dig> . the three most down-regulated genes include cflo_n_g <dig> , cflo_n_g <dig>  and cflo_n_g <dig> . b volcano plot from deseq data. up-regulated genes  are shown by blue dots and the down-regulated genes  are shown by orange dots. the top three protein coding genes most up-regulated are cflo_n_g <dig> , cflo_n_g <dig>  and cflo_n_g <dig> . the three top down-regulated genes include cflo_n_g <dig> , cflo_n_g <dig>  and cflo_n_g <dig> 



further validation of differential expression of  <dig> of the genes mentioned above was performed using qrt-pcr analysis. of these  <dig> genes  <dig> were up-regulated at least two-fold, and  <dig> genes down-regulated in the illumina data. for this analysis we differentiated between immune challenged larvae and adult animals instead of using pooled developmental stages which had been used for generation of the illumina data. in general, the qrt-pcr analysis confirmed the illumina data showing that the selected genes are regulated in the same direction in both larvae and workers, or at least in one of the two developmental stages. the corresponding heat map  visualises the comparison of immune gene expression results obtained by qrt-pcr or illumina sequencing. in table s <dig>  the respective x-fold changes as well as p- or q-values of these data are shown in detail. the differences between the expression data of immune-related genes gained by illumina sequencing or qrt-pcr may largely be explained by the fact that the change in expression of several genes after immune-challenge differs substantially between larvae and workers. for example, expression of the genes mpi , socs <dig> , cact <dig> , transf , phr , ester , pgrp-lb, pgrp-sa, hp <dig> , hymenoptaecin, and thioester-containing protein  <dig>  was strongly induced in immune-challenged larvae, but only weakly or not at all in workers . this is in agreement with previous reports on other insects which indicated that the immune response of larvae might differ from that of adults in holometabolous insects including workers in social insects . thus, in c. floridanus immune induction of gene expression appeared to be much stronger in larvae than in workers. at first glance this is somewhat surprising, since ant larvae are constantly cared for and groomed by nurse workers within the protected nest environment, while in particular foraging adult workers should be exposed more frequently and intensely to a feculent environment. however, larvae may be more vulnerable to pathogen infections due to their relatively thin and soft cuticle and the inability to groom themselves. therefore, a highly responsive immune gene regulation in particular in larvae may contribute to a long term colony success by ensuring a continuous supply of a large number of healthy offspring. in fact, recent infection experiments with c. pennsylvanicus larvae indicated that their individual immune response is important and brood care by nurses does not alleviate the individual immune competence of immature stages  <cit> . on the other hand, brood care is also of prime importance since it was shown recently by cross-fostering experiments that in the ant formica selysi the colony origin of care taker animals contributed to resistance of freshly eclosed animals against an entomopathogenic fungus  <cit> . in a. mellifera it was also shown that developmental stages differ in immunocompetence – larvae and pupae had the highest haemocyte counts while adult workers had the strongest phenoloxidase activity  <cit> .fig.  <dig> comparison of expression of  <dig> selected genes based on the analysis of the illumina sequencing data using cuffdiff and deseq and the corresponding qrt-pcr data. the heat map visualises the expression of  <dig> regulated immune genes 12 h after pricking of larvae and workers with a 1: <dig> mix of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in case of illumina sequencing . the corresponding qrt-pcr analysis was performed separately in larvae and workers revealing a stage-specific gene regulation after immune challenge ). up and down-regulation are colour coded as given in the key highlighting common directions of gene regulation in the different data sets



the gene most strongly induced after immune challenge should also be mentioned here. this gene  encodes a protein of unknown function. qrt-pcr reveals a more than  <dig> fold induction after immune challenge in larvae, but only a very moderate  induction in workers . due to its extreme expression pattern this protein might play an important role in the immune defence of larvae and might merit future attention. orthologs of this gene are also found in the other ants, in wasps  and in the termite zootermopsis nevadensis.

based on an orthology analysis six common differentially expressed ‘immune genes’ were found when comparing the c. floridanus data with a recently published dataset of immune-stimulated honey bees  <cit> . these genes encode known immune related proteins such as the serine protease stubble, nf-kappa-b inhibitor cactus, nuclear factor nf-kappa-b p <dig> subunit relish, leukocyte elastase inhibitor , tyrosine 3-monooxygenase , and a protein npc <dig> homolog .

several genes down-regulated after immune challenge were identified . among these genes several encode proteins involved in digestion  and storage , which were already described to be down-regulated upon immune-challenge in other insects. this indicates that during infection insects seem to temporarily shut down digestion and synthesis of non-essential proteins in order to use resources for costly defence reactions .

orthologous clusters were identified using orthomcl analysis on the proteomes of  <dig> insect species . orthomcl clustering included the eight ant species as well as a. mellifera, n. vitripennis and d. melanogaster. these proteomes clustered into  <dig>  groups from  <dig>  protein sequences. all eight ant species cluster into  <dig> ortholog groups . looking at the species distribution we found that  <dig> groups were shared by all the species analysed, while  <dig> groups were shared by all hymenopterans.  <dig> groups represent genes that are conserved exclusively among the eight ant species . we further parsed the  <dig>  groups with perl scripts to reveal the presence of orthologs of c. floridanus immune proteins in selected species. table s <dig>  lists the identified immune proteins of c. floridanus and their orthologs, if present in the other sequenced ants, a. mellifera and n. vitripennis. nine differentially regulated genes encoding putative immune-related proteins of c. floridanus do not have any homologs in other insects. kog annotations of these proteins, listed in table s <dig> , reveal features of some of these proteins including the presence of signal peptides, a chemosensory domain and a dna-binding domain. additionally, in a recent study hamilton and co-workers reported cathepsin d as a protein that contributes to social immunity in camponotus pennsylvanicus  <cit> . c. floridanus also encodes an ortholog of cathepsin d  and it will be interesting to investigate a general role of this protein in social immunity in the future.fig.  <dig> comparison of insect proteomes. specific numbers of shared orthologous clusters are indicated  comparing the proteomes of  <dig> insect species  as well as a. mellifera, n. vitripennis  and d. melanogaster 



CONCLUSIONS
we achieved an improved annotation and detailed analysis of the immune gene repertoire of c. floridanus based on the previously published genome sequence of c. floridanus and on an illumina based transcriptome analysis of immune challenged larvae and worker animals. this analysis allowed us to extend the previously annotated protein repertoire not only by about 20 % , but was instrumental in analysing the immune response of c. floridanus and to newly identify nine putative camponotus-specific proteins possibly involved in immune functions or stress response. furthermore, a comparative overview of immune proteins and pathways is presented which distinguishes between generally conserved parts, ant-specific and camponotus-specific additions. this analysis shows that the immune gene repertoire of c. floridanus is comparable to that of the other insects. especially signalling pathways are highly conserved. however, genes encoding pgn recognition proteins and amps appear to be present in a reduced number in comparison to solitary insects such as d. melanogaster and n. vitripennis. whether this apparent reduction in the number of certain immune genes is related to an increased use of social or external immune measures is not clear, since no attenuated selective pressure on immune genes could be observed in ant genomes, at least on several selected genes  <cit> . moreover, the recent establishment of the complete genomes of two bumblebee species and their comparison with other bee genomes including a solitary bee did not reveal any correlation between the number of immune genes and the degree of sociality evolved  <cit> . interestingly, the gene expression analysis suggests significant stage specific differences in the immune responsiveness of c. floridanus which may be an important feature possibly contributing to colony success, requiring, however, further investigation in the future. the combination of an apparently quite complex innate immune system and social immunity may explain the resilience of these animals against pathogen infestation despite high population densities in their nests and genetic uniformity.
