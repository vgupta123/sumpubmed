BACKGROUND
the k homology  is a prevalent rna binding domain that is an evolutionarily conserved domain initially identified as a repeated sequence in the heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein particle  k  <cit> . the kh domain is a small protein module consisting of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids and it is the second most prevalent rna binding domain next to the rrm   <cit> . the rna binding property of the kh domain was initially shown for fmrp, the gene product of the human fragile x syndrome and hnrnp k  <cit> . the kh domain is often found in multiple copies within proteins  and there is a subfamily that contains a single copy kh domain that is larger referred to as a maxi-kh domain  <cit> .

the kh domain makes direct protein-rna interactions with a three-dimensional β1α1α2β2β <dig> topology with an additional c-terminal α helix  for maxi-kh domains  <cit> . the feature of kh domains is an invariant gxxg loop located between α1/α <dig> that provides close contact with the phosphate groups such that the neighboring nucleotides can form watson and crick base pairing with conserved amino acids within the kh domain  <cit> . the structure determination of the kh domains has also been solved with single-stranded dna, demonstrating that certain kh domains may accommodate either rna or ssdna within their active site  <cit> .

there exists a subfamily of kh domains that contain extended loops between β1/α <dig> and β2/β <dig> and that contain an additional c-terminal helix in their topography  <cit> . these maxi-kh domain proteins contain conserved sequences immediately at the n- and c-terminal of the kh domain. the entire region is referred to as the star/gsg  domain  <cit> . although star proteins contain single kh domains, dimerization is required for rna binding  <cit> . the star proteins are mammalian sam <dig>  slm- <dig>  slm- <dig>  qki, sf <dig>  c. elegans gld- <dig>  drosophila how, kep <dig>  sam <dig> and artemia salina grp <dig>  <cit> . star proteins have been shown to function in pre-mrna splicing  <cit> , mrna export  <cit> , mrna stability  <cit>  and protein translation  <cit> . genetic evidence has implicated the star rna binding proteins in many cellular processes. these include the role of the qki isoforms in the process of myelination of the central nervous system  <cit> , gld- <dig> in the germline determination  <cit> , how in muscle and tendon differentiation  <cit> , kep <dig> in cell death processes  <cit>  and sam <dig> in bone marrow mesenchymal cell fate  <cit>  and motor defects  <cit> . genetic data has also implicated simple kh domain proteins fmrp in mental retardation and nova in paraneoplastic neurologic disorders  <cit> .

sf <dig> or branch point binding protein  was shown to recognize the branchpoint site rna sequence   <cit>  and structure determination has shown that there is direct protein-rna contact  <cit> . these studies have provided necessary information about the contact sites of maxi-kh domains and their similarities/differences with simple kh domains proteins such as nova. based on this information, ryder and coworkers showed that gld- <dig> binds a hexanucleotide sequence  and proposed it as the star binding site  <cit> . in a previous effort by using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment   <cit> , we defined the qki rna binding consensus sequence to be a bipartite motif consisting of a core nacuaay  sequence with an neighboring half-site   <cit> . in the present study, we define for the first time the rna binding specificity of the mammalian star protein, slm- <dig>  we identified using selex the slm- <dig> consensus sequence as a direct uaa repeat. the bipartite nature of the consensus rna sequence was essential for high affinity rna binding activity to slm- <dig>  the identification of a bipartite mrna binding site for qki  <cit>  and now for slm- <dig> prompted us to further determine whether sam <dig> and gld- <dig> also bound bipartite direct repeats. indeed sam <dig> and gld- <dig> required bipartite rnas, demonstrating that the star proteins slm- <dig>  sam <dig>  qki and gld- <dig> bind direct rna repeats as a bipartite motif in target rnas.

RESULTS
the identification of the slm- <dig> rna binding site by using selex
to identify the binding motif for the slm- <dig> rna binding protein, we performed selex to enrich for high affinity rna ligands. bacterial recombinant slm- <dig> expressed as a histidine epitope tagged fusion protein was generated and purified for the assay. synthetic rnas were transcribed with the t <dig> rna polymerase from dna pools of 52-nucleotide random-mers estimated at a complexity of  <dig>  ×  <dig> and we randomly sequenced  <dig> rna molecules from the initial library and noted, as expected, that each sequence was unique  <cit> . the transcribed rnas were generated in the presence of 32p-α-utp such that the amount of specific slm- <dig> bound rnas could be measured after each round. after six cycles of selection, we observed an approximately 10% of binding of the initial input , demonstrating that we indeed had enriched specific sequences. to confirm the selex amplification of the slm- <dig> specific rna ligands, we performed a gel electromobility shift assays  with purified pools of rna transcripts isolated from rounds  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the rnas were 32p-labelled and incubated with buffer or increasing concentration of his-slm- <dig>  the slm-2/rna complexes were observed as slow migrating complexes on native gel electrophoresis . more efficient rna binding was observed in round  <dig> than rounds  <dig> and  <dig> . after round  <dig>  the slm- <dig> bound rnas were converted into cdnas, subcloned and sequenced. the sequence of  <dig> clones revealed that  <dig> clones were unique . the clones were referred to as slm- <dig> response element - <dig> to  <dig>  class i rnas contained a bipartite motif consisting of direct repeats of the sequence uaa . our data show that the selected rna aptamers contained a bipartite motif with direct repeats and the spacing between the repeats varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  nucleotides . the  <dig> rnas identified that did not contain the bipartite sequence  were grouped in class ii and since ~10% of rnas from round  <dig> bound slm- <dig>  class ii rnas are likely to represent non-binders. no apparent secondary structure was identified in the sres using the prediction of rna secondary structure program mfold . taken together, we have identified a bipartite motif consisting of direct repeats of the sequence uaa as the slm- <dig> rna binding site.

the uaaa and uuaa conserved motifs are shown in bold. n = number of times identified.

a direct repeat of uaa defines the slm- <dig> rna binding consensus sequence
to define the characteristics of the slm- <dig> rna binding motif, we performed rna binding assays with sre- <dig> and sre- <dig>  we chose sre- <dig> and - <dig> for further analysis because sre- <dig> was the most frequently <cit>  identified rna and sre- <dig> contains a guanine-rich sequence at its 5'end in addition to the uuaa repeats. the  <dig> mer identified for sre- <dig> was trimmed to a  <dig> mer conserving  <dig> nucleotides on the 5' and 3' end of the uaa consensus sequence and designated this as sre-4wt. this synthetic rna bound slm- <dig> with a high affinity dissociation constant of ~ <dig> nm  like the  <dig> mer sre- <dig> sequences . the substitution of the either or both uaa motifs with cccc abolished slm- <dig> binding . similarly, the replacement of the uaaa with uacc abolished rna binding . these finding demonstrate that both tetra-nucleotide motifs aa) are required for slm- <dig> high affinity rna binding.

uaa motifs are shown in bold and mutated residues are small letters

we analyzed sre- <dig> and identified a g-rich sequence that may represent a g quartet. we first proceeded by replacing the g-rich nucleotides with u-rich sequence and this had little effect on slm- <dig> rna binding activity . interestingly, the replacement of the g-rich sequences with au-rich sequences such as to introduce a third uaa motif enhanced slm- <dig> rna binding to this rna species . the substitution of the downstream uuuaau sequence with cgacgc abolished slm- <dig> rna binding consistent with the uaa requirement . numerous 5' and 3' deletions were performed and a minimal sequence of  <dig> nucleotides was identified containing both uaa motifs that bound with a kd of ~ <dig>  nm . the substitution of the 5' or 3' uaa motifs reduced the slm- <dig> high affinity binding site , demonstrating that indeed slm- <dig> binds rna with high-affinity to direct repeats of uaa.

sam <dig> binds the slm- <dig> response element
selex has been performed with recombinant sam <dig> and a uaaa consensus was defined as a necessary rna binding site  <cit> . as there is 69% sequence identity between the slm- <dig> and sam <dig> star/gsg domains  <cit> , we tested the possibility that the slm- <dig> consensus  may be bound by sam <dig>  using emsa with recombinant sam <dig> containing only the star/gsg domain, we observed that indeed the gsg domain of sam <dig> bound the sre-4wt rna aptamer, but not the variants that contain mutated uaa motifs . there was one variant of sre- <dig>  that retained some binding and this is likely due to the polyuridine stretch  that remained between the two uaa motifs . these findings demonstrate that sam <dig> also has the capabilities to bind a bipartite uaa consensus.

defining the bipartite nature of the qki response element within the mrnas of myelin basic protein
the mrnas encoding the myelin basic proteins  are known qki targets  <cit> . the qki rna binding site was defined to be a core  with a neighboring half-site   <cit> . the mbp qres were defined as qre- <dig> and qre- <dig>  <cit> . qre- <dig> is interesting as it contains two regions with an overlapping imperfect core  and half-site   as well as downstream perfect half-site  . alternatively, region a is recognized as the imperfect half-site   and as the perfect core . to define the requirements of qre- <dig>  we performed emsa with various combinations of region a and b. the qre- <dig> sequences with regions a and b bound qki with high affinity  and the substitution of the uaac half-site in region a or region b diminished considerably the rna binding affinity . the substitution of the uaca to gaga in region a bound with high affinity demonstrating that region a supplies the perfect core  and region b supplies the half-site  of the bipartite motif. these findings demonstrated that region a without region was unable to serve as a high affinity site for qki . ryder and williamson showed that region a alone was bound with high affinity by qki. we next centered region a and this considerably improved qki binding with a kd of ~ <dig> nm . the substitution of either the uaua to gaga  or the uaac to gagc  significantly reduced qki rna binding . these findings define the qre- <dig> as requiring a bipartite motif located in region a or in region a plus region b.

gld- <dig> binds a bipartite rna motif containing the hexanucleotide
a high affinity rna binding site has been defined for c. elegans gld- <dig> that consists of a hexanucleotide a)  <cit> . to examine whether the gld- <dig> hexanucleotide sequence also requires a similar half-site, we performed emsa assays with a segment of the tra <dig> and gli repeated element  containing the hexanucleotide  and its neighboring half site . gld- <dig> bound this wild-type tge sequence and a variation of it  with approximate kd ~ <dig> nm, defining a short sequence for gld- <dig> high affinity binding . these data are consistent with previous competition experiments that defined the gld- <dig> kd ~ <dig> nm that defined the hexanucleotide as a)  <cit> . the nucleotide substitution of the half-site  abolished rna binding , consistent with the need for a half-site in addition to the hexanucleotide. similar binding experiments were performed with qki and we observed that tge-m <dig> is essentially a qre bound with high affinity, whereas the wild-type tge bound with a moderate affinity of approximately  <dig> nm . the tge-m <dig> was not bound by qki . in summary, these data identify the gld- <dig> rna binding motif as bipartite as observed with slm- <dig>  qki, and sam <dig> 

discussion & 
CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we identified a slm- <dig> consensus sequence as direct uaa repeats using selex. the bipartite nature of the consensus sequence was essential for slm- <dig> high affinity rna binding. the identification of a bipartite mrna binding site for qki  <cit>  and now slm- <dig> prompted us to determine whether sam <dig> and gld- <dig> also bound bipartite direct repeats. indeed sam <dig> bound the slm- <dig> consensus and required both uaa motifs. also, gld- <dig> required sequences within the uaay half-site in addition to its conservative consensus nacua, defining a gld- <dig> bipartite motif. taken together, these data demonstrate that the star proteins slm- <dig>  sam <dig>  qki and gld- <dig> bind direct rna repeats.

defining the slm- <dig> rna binding site as uaa repeats
we identified slm- <dig> in  <dig> by searching databases with sam <dig> sequences  <cit> . independently slm- <dig>  was identified as an interacting protein of rbm, an rna binding protein involved in spermatogenesis  <cit> . slm- <dig> is known to bind homopolymeric rna  <cit> , localize to sam <dig> nuclear bodies   <cit> , regulate alternative splicing  <cit>  and dimerize with sam <dig> and slm- <dig>  <cit> . slm- <dig> is post-translationally modified to contain methylarginines  <cit>  and phosphotyrosines, the latter impairs its ability to associate with rna  <cit> . the expression of slm- <dig> is mainly restricted to testis and brain, but its function in these tissues remains unknown  <cit> .

previously we showed that slm- <dig> had a preference for poly  rich homopolymeric rna  <cit> , therefore, we searched the selex hits for poly  rich sequences that could possibly resemble a g-quartet as bound by fmrp  <cit> . the slm- <dig> selected rna  contained a variation of this sequence , but its deletion did not affect slm- <dig> rna binding. therefore, we next focused on the uaa rich repeats that resemble the consensus identified with sam <dig> selex  <cit> . indeed we mapped the slm- <dig> consensus sequence to direct repeats of the uaa sequence, defining a slm- <dig> rna binding site as a bipartite motif. this motif is too frequently found in mrnas especially in 3'-utr to perform a bioinformatic analysis to identify the slm- <dig> mrna targets . thus the specificity in slm- <dig> function is most likely contributed by its tissue specific expression and post-translational modifications may alter its rna binding specificity and/or accessibility.

sam <dig> is known to bind cellular rna as well as dna  <cit> . sam <dig> is known to have a preference for poly  and poly  homopolymeric rna and this association is abrogated with tyrosine phosphorylation by src kinases and brk  <cit> . differential display and cdna representation difference analysis identified  <dig> potential rna binding targets of which  <dig> bind in a kh-dependent manner  <cit> . sam <dig> binding sequences on hnrnp a2/b <dig> and β-actin mrnas were mapped to uaaa and uuuuuu nucleotide motifs, respectively and both motifs occur within specific loop structures  <cit> . sam <dig> has also been shown to transport unspliced hiv rnas  <cit> . the knockout sam <dig> mice are protected against the development of osteoporosis pointing towards an enhancement of the mesenchymal stem cell differentiation along the osteogenic rather than the adipocyte pathway  <cit> . the mice also have motor coordination defects  <cit> . the identification of sam <dig> in these physiological processes will help direct the search for specific physiological mrna targets. the work performed herein demonstrates that the star/gsg domain of sam <dig> has similar rna binding capabilities to slm- <dig>  as suggested by their 69% sequence identity within their star/gsg domains  <cit> .

quaking: a regulator of myelination
the quaking viable  mice represent an animal model of dysmyelination  <cit> . the defect is summarized as an incomplete maturation of the myelin sheath. this is due to the lack in proper oligodendrocyte differentiation, resulting in the failure to transport intracellular myelin components such as the mbp mrnas  <cit> . qki null animals have been generated, but the embryos die at ~e <dig> – <dig>  day, providing little information about the role of qki in myelination  <cit> . by using a gain-of-function approach with ectopic expression of the qki isoforms, we showed previously that qki- <dig> and qki- <dig> promote oligodendrocyte differentiation by up-regulating p27kip <dig>  confirming the role for the qki isoforms during myelination  <cit> . the qki response element was defined as a core nacuaay  <cit>  with a neighboring uaay  <cit> . this led to the identification of two binding sites within the mrnas for the mbps  <cit> . qre- <dig> contains 3' adjacent half-sites that function as a moderate affinity site. in the present study, we demonstrate that region a in qre- <dig>  shown previously to mediate binding  <cit> , becomes a better site with the presence of the half site from region b . our findings show that qre- <dig> within the 3'utr of mbp mrnas is indeed a bipartite consensus sequence with a core nacuaay and a neighboring uaay.

the mbp mrnas are localized at the distal processes of oligodendrocytes in intact tissue  <cit> . the factors necessary for mbp mrna localization are oligodendrocyte-specific, as transfected mbp mrna into non-glial cells did not properly localize to the cell membrane  <cit> . studies performed in living cells by microinjection have shown that the mbp mrna forms granules, which appear dispersed in the perikaryon and are transported down the processes  <cit> . mbp is not the only mrna known to be localized to the distal processes of oligodendrocytes, as myelin oligodendrocytes basic protein , alpha-camkii, tau, amyloid precursor protein  and others are also transported to the site of myelination  <cit> . transport and localization elements have been mapped in the 3' utr of rat and mouse mbp mrna. a 21-nucleotide sequence named rna transport signal  mapped at nucleotide  <dig> to  <dig> of rat mbp or nucleotide  <dig> to  <dig> of mouse mbp has been identified as a transport element  <cit> . this sequence is homologous to several other localized mrnas, suggesting a general transport signal. in rat oligodendrocytes, another localization element has been mapped to nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig> named the rna localization region , but the region  <dig> to  <dig> containing the rts and qre- <dig> is sufficient for localization  <cit> . hnrnp a <dig> has been shown to be one of the component which binds the rts sequence  <cit> , and insertion of the rts into gfp resulted in enhanced translation  <cit> . the mapping of qre- <dig>  constitutes another element that may be necessary for proper export of the mbp mrna into the cytoplasm and subsequent production of the mbp at its site of synthesis. it is likely that qki works in combination with hnrnp a <dig> and the other components of the rnp granule in the proper transport of the mbp mrna, its localization and its translation.

the c. elegans homolog of qki is gld- <dig>  a known protein translation inhibitor required for germ-line differentiation  <cit> . many gld- <dig> mrna targets have been identified  <cit>  and a conservative consensus sequence of nacua was defined by comparing the binding specificity with sf <dig>  <cit> . most, but not all mrna targets  <cit> , contain this conversed consensus sequence. the demonstration that gld- <dig> like qki requires a neighboring half-site is consistent with the ~50% sequence identity within their star/gsg domains.

sam68/slm- <dig> tetranucleotide versus qki/gld- <dig> hexanucleotide sequence requirements
the rna binding domain of star/gsg proteins consist in a maxi-kh domain flanked by two conserved sequences . the nk/qua <dig> and ck/qua <dig> region refer to the n- and c-terminal region, respectively, flanking the kh domain. based on the structure of the kh domain of sf- <dig> associated with its binding rna molecule u1a2c3u4a5a6c <dig>  the ck region makes important contacts with the rna. all star domain containing proteins have the most important gxxg sequence located in a loop between the two first alpha helices of the kh domain. this sequence of residues is absolutely conserved among the star domain proteins and makes the contact with the rna especially with the bases u4a5a6c <dig>  by looking closely at the residues in the ck region that make important association with the rna bases, we find that two residues  seems to confer the slm-2/sam <dig> specificity versus the qki/gld- <dig> specificity. the slm-2/sam <dig> residues are a threonine or a serine and a conserved glutamic acid while the qki/gld-1/sf <dig> residues consist in a conserved alanine and a conserved arginine. these residues make important contact with base a <dig> which specificity is lost in the slm-2/sam <dig> consensus binding sequence. in fact, slm-2/sam <dig> binding sequence resembles in all points to the qki/gld-1/sf <dig> core binding sequence but lacking u1a2c <dig> bases.

the star protein sf <dig> structure was determined and the amino acids that contact the rna were identified  <cit> . based on these contact amino acids, it explains why sf <dig>  qki and gld- <dig> have near identical binding specificity. the sam <dig>  slm- <dig> and slm- <dig> subfamily have different amino acids in the rna contact position and it should be possible by amino acid substitution to convert a sam <dig> domain into a gld- <dig> domain that will bind the nacuac gld- <dig> consensus sequence. lehmann-blount & williamson  have performed such experiments and were unable by mutagenesis to identify an amino acid 'code' that would dictate gld-1-like versus sam68-like specificity  <cit> . this led them to propose that sam <dig> and hence slm- <dig> and slm- <dig> might not be rna binding proteins or possess an rna binding specificity that is fundamentally unlike that of gld- <dig>  <cit> . the identification of a high affinity rna target for slm- <dig> with the characteristics of a gld-1/qki bipartite motif, demonstrates that sam <dig>  slm- <dig> and slm- <dig> subfamily are indeed rna binding proteins, but does not exclude the possibility that they may also bind ssdna. the challenge ahead will be to identify the physiological rna targets linking with the phenotypes observed in mammals.
