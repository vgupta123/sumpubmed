BACKGROUND
the cancer cell karyotype is often complex and can include a range of molecular alterations that span mutations at the single nucleotide level to extensive rearrangements involving whole chromosomes. the activation of oncogenes as the result of dna amplifications and the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes as the result of dna deletions can both contribute to the cancer cell phenotype. with the recent identification of large scale copy number polymorphisms  in the human genome as well, it is increasingly clear that a detailed understanding of the role of genomic alterations and structure will be important in the context of both the normal and disease state  <cit> . over the years many experimental approaches have been described that have increased our knowledge of the cancer genome. these include genome-wide approaches such as array comparative genomic hybridization  to cdna clones  <cit> , bacterial artificial chromosomes , p <dig> artificial chromosomes   <cit> , and long oligonucleotides  <cit> , restriction landmark genome scanning   <cit> , spectral karyotyping   <cit> , molecular subtraction such as rda  <cit> , digital karyotyping  <cit> , and end sequence profiling   <cit>  as well as more focused approaches such as high-throughput quantitative pcr  and fluorescence in situ hybridization   <cit> . while no single experimental approach allows the comprehensive analysis of all types of chromosomal aberrations, array-based approaches offer the greatest potential for high resolution genome-wide scans.

high density dna oligonucleotide arrays using light-directed parallel chemical synthesis allow unprecedented levels of genetic information to be captured in single experiments  <cit> . the completion of the human genome sequence, coupled with the emergence of single nucleotide polymorphisms  as the most common form of genetic variation among individuals, has led to a variety of applications for high density genotyping arrays. in the past, these arrays have been used in traditional loss of heterozygosity  analysis using standard approaches of multiplex pcr for dna target generation  <cit> . more recently, a dna target generation method using complexity reduction by single primer pcr, termed whole genome sampling assay , was developed for simultaneous genotyping of over  <dig>   <dig> snps on a single array  <cit> . this array has been used for hierarchical tumor clustering based on loh patterns with human lung cancer cell lines  <cit> , the characterization of loh progression in samples from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who relapse after chemotherapy  <cit> , and for a case-control study of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma   <cit> . furthermore, the array has also been shown to accurately detect genome-wide dna copy number changes  <cit> . by coupling snp genotypes with copy number information, detailed insight into genomic structure can be gleaned. for example, genomic regions displaying loh can be differentiated into regions with hemizygous deletions and regions with no change in copy number, i.e. copy neutral events, and genomic regions undergoing copy number loss without loh can also be detected  <cit> . allelic imbalance, of which loh is one example, can also occur when one allele is preferentially amplified relative to the other allele. the coupling of genotypic information with copy number information from a single array allows genome-wide allele-typing to be carried out  <cit> . this type of combined analysis can not be made using approaches such as array cgh  and thus underscores the potential power of identifying novel genomic alterations using high density snp genotyping arrays.

recently, the wgsa assay has been extended to allow highly accurate snp genotyping of over  <dig>  snps from two arrays  <cit> . with an average inter-marker distance of  <dig>  kb, the arrays provide dense enough coverage to enable whole-genome association studies  <cit> . in this report we describe a novel algorithm termed carat  that uses probe intensity information from the genechipÂ® mapping  <dig> k set for genome-wide allele-specific copy number estimations. carat is predicated on the use of the highly accurate genotypes derived from the array to evaluate allelic dose responses on a snp-by-snp basis, thereby allowing the copy number output for each allele to be determined. we show using dna samples from established cell lines that different types of genetic alterations  are readily detectable using an allele-specific copy number approach. thus the coupling of snp genotypes with allele-specific copy number information may provide new insight into complex genomic alterations, such as regions undergoing allelic imbalance due to differential allelic amplification.

RESULTS
we have previously described the use of the  <dig> k snp genotyping array for chromosomal copy number analysis  <cit> . recently, the ability to genotype  <dig> k snps on a set of arrays has become available and these arrays have been used for high resolution copy number analysis  <cit> . as with the  <dig> k array, the  <dig> k array set uses the wgsa target preparation scheme in which single primer pcr amplification of specific fractions of the genome is carried out. the primary difference with the  <dig> k wgsa method is the use of two separate restriction enzymes that each generates a higher complexity fraction estimated to be ~ <dig> mb. in this report we describe a new algorithm called carat. in carat, a complex normalization scheme that incorporates both restriction fragment and probe sequence information is applied on individual arrays to reduce any systematic error and to increase comparability across experiments. probes for each snp are tested for the ability to support an allelic dosage response using a set of normal individuals in which the 'aa', 'ab', and 'bb' genotypes intrinsically represent zero, one, and two copies of the 'b' allele and two, one, and zero copies of the 'a' allele. probes displaying a strong dosage response are employed in a regression framework to estimate allele-specific copy number. for any target sample, the sum of the copy number estimates from the two alleles is compared against the reference set to derive a significance measure of the deviation from the diploid state. smoothing is used on the estimated copy number and its corresponding significance to further reduce the experimental and technical noise. regression trees  <cit>  are applied on the smoothed result to partition the genome into regions with different copy numbers and to assign an overall significance to such changes.

wgsa  <dig> k arrays perform robustly for snp genotyping, with call rates, reproducibility, and accuracy greater than 99%,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % respectively  <cit> . since carat does rely on genotype calls, any snps with systematic errors in the calls could potentially bias the results. in order to prevent any such bias, only genotypes with stringent confidence rank scores are used, and snps that do not meet this criterion are scored as "no calls". although the majority of steps in carat do not make use of "no call" snps, there are several steps that do use them, in which case they are always compared against all genotypes to reduce any systematic bias in the analysis.

among the full complement of over  <dig> k snps,  <dig>   display a high allelic dose response as defined by a linear correlation greater than  <dig>  between the target concentration and chip intensity. among these snps,  <dig>  incorporated information from all  <dig> perfect match  probes  and  <dig> pm 'b' allele ),  <dig>  incorporated information from  <dig> ~  <dig> probes,  <dig>  incorporated information from  <dig> ~  <dig> probes,  <dig>  incorporated information from  <dig> ~  <dig> probes,  <dig>  incorporated information from  <dig> or  <dig> out of  <dig> probes, and no snps used less than  <dig> probes. this subset of  <dig>   <dig> snps, with an average inter-marker distance of  <dig>  kb, was used in carat for copy number estimations.

the performance of carat was evaluated with a set of test samples that included  <dig> normal individuals, dna samples with varying numbers of x chromosomes , and several human breast cancer cell lines that harbor both low level and high level copy number alterations. none of these test samples have any overlap with the  <dig> training samples that are used to establish and tune the carat models.

the relationship between dna copy number and fluorescent intensity of the snp hybridization signal was evaluated using genomic dna derived from cell lines with a defined number of x chromosomes . among the  <dig>  selected snps,  <dig>  map to the x chromosome. a normal 2x  female sample was used as the reference for comparisons to the 1x, 3x, 4x, and 5x samples. the results are summarized in figure  <dig>  panels a-d show that there is a high linear correlation among the sample pairs, and only x-chromosome snps  show intensity profile shifts across the four panels while the autosomal snps  remain static. panel e indicates that there is a strong linear relationship between the log transformed copy number and the log transformed intensity. these results show that the  <dig> k wgsa pcr fractions maintain a nice dose response between the input template copy number and the post hybridization snp fluorescent intensity.

these  <dig> hapmap ceph samples  thus served as an independent test set to evaluate the accuracy of the snp copy number estimations as well as the algorithm's false-positive rate . these samples were assumed to represent normal diploid genomes which do not harbor extensive genomic deletions or amplifications. although these samples could contain copy number polymorphisms, they are relatively rare and were not considered in this analysis, which potentially could lead to an overestimation of the true false positive rate. there were  <dig>  autosomal snps among the total of  <dig>  selected snps that were examined across the  <dig> individuals for a total of  <dig> , <dig> data points; x chromosome snps were excluded due to copy number differences between males and females. one possible explanation for the higher-than-expected false positive rate at the stringent p-value of less than 10- <dig> is that they are not false positives but rather true and significant copy number polymorphisms occurring in normal people. for example, there were  <dig> data points identified with a significance level less than 10- <dig>  among them,  <dig> snps were derived from a common amplified region on chromosome  <dig> from two samples originating from the same trio, namely na <dig>  and na <dig> , with each sample showing the same  <dig> significant snps. although this amplified region  has not been independently verified using qpcr, it does partially overlap with a bac clone  from 8p <dig> that has detected a cnp  <cit>  and thus may represent a cnp that is transmitted through generations. the copy number estimation of each autosomal snp across these  <dig> test samples also has relatively low variation as shown in the upper panel of figure  <dig>  the mean copy number estimate across all autosomal snps ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and is similar whether using only kernel smoothing or kernel smoothing combined with regression trees. however, by adding the regression tree as the final partition step, the standard deviation is dramatically reduced by an average of  <dig> %, and the range changes from  to . the lower panel shows the proportion of the genome on a per-sample basis that does not contain any significant changes. using regression trees, there are many more regions identified as diploid as compared to using kernel smoothing only, indicating an improvement in the apparent false positive rate.

receiver operating characteristic  curves were used to evaluate the overall sensitivity  and specificity  of different stages of carat. the curves are calculated using  <dig>  x chromosome snps, with the false positive rate estimated by averaging the individual false positive signals across the  <dig> female samples present in the total set of  <dig> normal individuals. figure  <dig> shows the roc curves derived from different stages of the algorithm using dna samples with differing numbers of x-chromosomes; table  <dig> summarizes the area under those curves depicted in figure  <dig>  the most significant improvement comes from the adjustment based on fragment length, gc content and reference mean; the auc  increases about 50% for the 1x, 3x and 4x samples and  <dig> % for the 5x sample. the improvement from probe-selection is relatively modest, resulting in an overall increase across the samples of about 5%. although adding kernel smoothing in stage  <dig> and tree partitions in stage  <dig> does not substantially increase the auc, these steps are nevertheless critical. these two steps drive the auc towards  <dig>  ensuring high sensitivity while keeping the specificity extremely low, which is a necessity since nearly  <dig> k snps are simultaneously being examined. in the tree partitioning step , the roc curves are ideal for the 4x and the 5x samples, rendering an auc of  <dig>  for the 1x and the 3x samples, the roc curves are not smooth but rather step-functions that achieve a 100% true positive rate with a minimum false positive rate. this occurs because for each case the regression tree step successfully identifies the variations on the x chromosome as one altered region and assigns the region a high significance score that rarely occurs in normal female samples.

note:

1the specificity is estimated using the  <dig> female samples that are a subset of the  <dig> normal test set samples and is restricted to the  <dig> x chromosome snps. the sensitivity is estimated on  <dig> x chromosome snps using dna samples with 1x, 3x, 4x and 5x chromosomes.

2stage 1: single point analysis: no probe selection, no intensity adjustment on fragment length and gc content; no intensity adjustment on reference mean.

3stage 2: stage  <dig> plus probe selection.

4stage 3: stage  <dig> plus intensity adjustment on the fragment length and gc content and intensity adjustment on the reference mean.

5stage 4: stage  <dig> plus kernel smoothing with a  <dig> kb window.

6stage 5: stage  <dig> plus genome partitioning using the regression tree.

the previous dna samples with variable x chromosome content provided a means to evaluate the algorithm using large alterations that span the length of an entire chromosome. in order to better evaluate the performance of carat when the alterations were of low level copy number changes that did not span entire chromosomes, as well as evaluating carat relative to other methods, a series of experiments were carried out. these experiments included qpcr on  <dig> snps chosen from the cancer cell line sk-br- <dig>  qpcr around the her2/neu region using three cancer cell lines; and allele-specific taqman on nine snps across two cell lines coupled with dna sequence analysis. all experimental results show a high correlation with carat-derived estimates, indicating that the algorithm in combination with the mapping  <dig> k array set can detect chromosomal copy number changes in an accurate and quantitative manner.

we used qpcr as an independent method to determine the total copy number of  <dig> autosomal snps from sk-br- <dig>  these results were then compared to copy number output from carat and two additional algorithms used for mapping  <dig> k copy number analysis, namely dchip  <cit>  and cnag  <cit> . these snps are derived from regions of sk-br- <dig> that display copy number gains and losses as well as regions with no detectable changes, covering  <dig> of the  <dig> autosomes and more than  <dig> different regions;  <dig> of the  <dig> snps have a copy number between  <dig>  and  <dig> , indicating no major alterations from diploidy;  <dig> of the  <dig> snps have been excluded from cnag because the snps reside on restriction fragments shorter than  <dig> bp and are resistant to the compensations used in cnag . figure  <dig> summarizes the comparison of the correlations between the copy number derived from the three algorithms at different stages and the copy number derived from qpcr. the results show that the correlation values across the three methods are not significantly different. however, both cnag and dchip under-estimate the total dna copy number, although to different extents. in cnag, neither the averaging across neighboring points nor the hmm procedure leads to a significant increase in the correlation. in contrast, the hmm step in dchip and the kernel smoothing step in carat do improve their respective correlations. in table  <dig>  the performance of the three methods is examined by evaluating the sensitivity and specificity using the same  <dig> qpcr results. in cnag, because the estimation is biased towards the normal diploid state, it achieves perfect specificity while demonstrating substantially lower sensitivity compared to the other two methods. although dchip and carat have similar performances with one another, carat has a higher sensitivity in the single-point estimation step and the smoothing step while dchip has higher specificity in the smoothing step. in dchip, the averaging and hmm steps steadily improve both the sensitivity and the specificity while in carat the sensitivity remains the same while the specificity is substantially increased through the three stages. neither dchip nor cnag has a significance measure associated with the estimated copy number at the single snp level. thus, in an attempt to compare the three algorithms, only copy number output from carat has been used, rather than the combination of copy number output and the associated p-values. the only exception to this is the analysis of the tree partitioning step in which algorithm-based true negatives are defined as snps with p-value >  <dig>  and algorithm-based true positives are defined as snps with p-value <  <dig> . although the p-values from the regression tree step may not have a direct probabilistic interpretation, they nonetheless are derived from individual p-value estimates and thus serve as confidence scores that measures how significantly the region deviates from the diploid state. the use of a significance level rather than a copy number value as a threshold to differentiate altered regions from normal regions is appropriate with carat, and provides a more accurate estimation of the true performance of carat. in this case, carat achieves perfect specificity of one and a very high specificity resulting in overall superior performance.

note: snps that have no copy number alterations relative to the diploid state  are defined by a qpcr derived copy number between  <dig>  and  <dig> . snps that have copy number alterations  are defined by a qpcr derived copy number less than  <dig>  or greater than  <dig> . there are in total  <dig> true negatives among all  <dig> snps. for the  <dig> snps that are common to cnag, there are  <dig> true negatives. the calculations of sensitivity and specificity compare qpcr values to algorithm outputs in which algorithm-defined true negatives are the snps with an estimated copy number between  <dig>  and  <dig>  and algorithm-defined true positives are the snps with an estimated copy number less than  <dig>  or greater than  <dig> . in the carat tree-partitioning  comparison, the algorithm defined negative snps are those with p-value >  <dig>  and algorithm defined positive snps are those with p-value <  <dig> . numerical values without parentheses are derived from comparisons using only the  <dig> snps that are in common with cnag while the numbers inside parentheses are derived from comparisons using all  <dig> snps.

additional verification of dna copy number changes detected by carat was done using the highly characterized region on chromosome 17q <dig> harboring the erbb <dig>  proto-oncogene that is amplified in nearly 30% of breast cancers  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows a comparison of chromosome  <dig> for three human breast cancer cell lines. the genomic region near her2/neu appears amplified in the two cancer cell lines sk-br- <dig>  and zr-75- <dig>  with moderate to very strong significance  and does not appear amplified in mcf- <dig> . this is consistent with published cgh results that show sk-br- <dig> and zr-75- <dig>  but not mcf- <dig>  contain gains in 17q <dig>  <cit>  as well as with erbb2-specific fish showing amplification in sk-br- <dig>  but not mcf- <dig>   <cit> . quantitative pcr was carried out with a her2/neu primer pair and confirmed the copy number increase in two of the three cell lines . the estimated her2/neu copy number by qpcr for sk-br- <dig>  mcf- <dig>  and zr-75- <dig> is  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  respectively. while the array set does not contain snps within the her2/neu gene, the snps which flank the locus are snps  <dig> and  <dig>  carat results for these snps are also summarized in table  <dig> and confirm that the region surrounding her2/neu is amplified in two of the three cell lines. in figure  <dig> all three cell lines show loh in this region. based on carat, mcf- <dig> shows one copy loss at the her2/neu locus itself and proximal to the locus while there is no apparent copy number change distal to the locus. additionally, sk-br- <dig> and zr-75- <dig> both show differential amplification of one allele relative to the other, resulting in allelic imbalance. these regions also serve to underscore how genotypic information can complement copy number information in the detection of complex structural alterations in regions exhibiting loh. in figure  <dig> panels b, d and f, results from carat are also consistent with additional regional copy-number increases observed by cgh using metaphase chromosomes in mcf- <dig> , sk-br- <dig> , and zr-75- <dig>   <cit> .

we chose  <dig> snps distributed across five different chromosomes for taqman analysis as an independent verification of allelic copy number information. these snps were identified by carat and represent various types of alterations. allelic copy number results from carat and taqman for these snps across two cell lines are summarized in table  <dig>  taqman reactions for each snp were done with genomic dna from sk-br- <dig> and zr-75- <dig> as well as with normal dna samples representing aa, ab, and bb genotypes that serve as positive controls for allele dosage. there are a total of  <dig> allele-specific copy number estimates when combining results for nine snps from the two cancer cell lines on both alleles. in general, there is a high linear correlation between the allelic copy number estimates using the algorithm and the allelic copy number derived from taqman reactions . among the  <dig> data points, there are  <dig> examples with a taqman-determined copy number lower than  <dig>  and thus may indicate the loss of an allele.  <dig> out of these  <dig> examples also show a carat copy number estimation lower than  <dig> , indicating a strong consistency between the two methods. these  <dig> examples can be further separated into four categories:  normal homozygous snp , which includes snp  <dig> and snp  <dig> from zr-75-30;  homozygous deletion , which includes snp  <dig> from sk-br-3;  hemizygous deletion , which includes snps  <dig> and  <dig> from sk-br- <dig> and snps  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> from zr-75-30;  hemizgyous deletion and one allele amplification , which includes snp  <dig> from both samples, and snp  <dig> from sk-br- <dig>  there are also  <dig> examples with a taqman-determined copy number higher than  <dig>  indicating putative allelic amplification; all of these  <dig> examples also have a carat copy number estimation higher than  <dig> . some examples are explained by category  described above, while the remaining examples all appear as asymmetric amplifications , including snps  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> from sk-br- <dig> and snps  <dig> and  <dig> from zr-75- <dig>  when the taqman-determined total copy number is less than  <dig> or greater than  <dig>  the carat determined p-value is always very significant  with a single exception of snp  <dig> from zr-75- <dig> .

note: wgsa results for  <dig> snps are shown in columns labeled cn_a  and cn_b . allelic copy number estimates by taqman reactions are shown in parentheses. dm call refers to the genotype call made using the dynamic model algorithm  using a confidence rank score of  <dig> . the vic reporter dye was measuring the a allele for all snps except snp  <dig> . the fam reporter dye was measuring the b allele for all snps except snp  <dig> .

in addition to allelic taqman reactions, direct dna sequencing was carried out on pcr amplicons from both cell lines for seven of the snps. several examples are shown in figure  <dig>  panels a and d represent sequence traces using a forward primer for snp  <dig> from sk-br- <dig> and zr-75- <dig> respectively. the polymorphic nucleotide in the sense strand is either c  or t . sk-br- <dig> shows a clear blue peak representing the a allele while zr-75- <dig> shows a clear red peak representing the b allele. both of these base calls are consistent with the predominant allele identified by both carat and taqman. the copy number of allele b  from sk-br- <dig> is below  <dig>  copies based on carat and taqman while the copy number of allele a is greater than six with both methods. the dna sequence trace however does not detect the presence of the minor allele. in contrast, the signal from the minor allele can be detected in the case of snp  <dig> as shown in panels b, c, e, and f. the polymorphic nucleotide in the sense strand is either g  or t . sequence traces using the forward primer show that in both cell lines the major allele is the a allele  as indicated by the black peak. however, zr-75- <dig> also shows a smaller red peak indicating the presence of allele b . the tracings using the reverse primer also confirm the major allele is the a allele  in both cell lines, and zr-75- <dig> again shows a minor green peak corresponding to allele b . there is no clear detection of the minor allele in the sequence traces from sk-br- <dig>  which is consistent with both the carat  and taqman  results. in zr-75- <dig>  the ratio of the a allele peak height to the b allele peak height is  <dig>  in the forward traces and  <dig>  in the reverse traces, which are in general agreement with the allele ratios of  <dig>  by carat and  <dig>  by taqman. thus the dna sequencing results for this snp confirm the carat and taqman results which suggested that allele b was present in at least one to two copies in zr-75- <dig> but not in sk-br- <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed an algorithm carat used in conjunction with the genechipÂ® mapping  <dig> k set that provides accurate copy number estimates in an allele-specific manner. this algorithm makes use of the highly accurate genotypic information across a set of normal individuals to identify probes with strong allele-specific dose responses. the copy number estimation is accompanied by a significance score derived by a comparison to a reference set of normal individuals. kernel smoothing with a gaussian kernel and a relatively small bandwidth of 100kb is applied on the individual estimates in an attempt to achieve a balance between resolution and noise reduction. regression trees are applied at the final stage as a method to partition the genome into regions that share the same copy number and to assign an overall copy number and significance to every region that alters from the diploid state. this partitioning step further reduces the random variability from snp to snp and increases the interpretability of the output. although regression trees are conceptually simple, they solve the complex issue of how to define genomic regions with similar alterations. the assumption under regression trees is that different regions of the feature space have a constant outcome. with a series of recursive binary splits, they efficiently and accurately stratify the feature space into groups such that the random deviation from the fitted constant is minimized  <cit> . in the application of regression trees to dna copy number analysis, the feature space is one dimensional and corresponds to the physical location on the chromosome while the outcome is the unknown copy number. the non-parametric nature of the tree method thus uncouples it from the many assumptions associated with particular distributions, which is especially appropriate for this array-platform since the behavior of probe intensity can be complex and difficult to summarize. the kernel smoothing step used for noise reduction and the tree partitioning step used for genome segmentation provide an optimal combination that renders high performance along with simple interpretation of the output  <cit> . this combination of information allows genomic alterations that lead to allelic imbalance to be characterized in a manner that is not currently possible by approaches such as cgh. additionally, allelic copy number potentially allows examples of both whole chromosome and segmental uniparental disomy to be identified as well as genome-wide assessments of monoallelic amplification  <cit> .

there are a number of alternative statistical methods that have been used to analyze array data for the purpose of copy number variation detection. several approaches have used hidden markov models   <cit> . although in general the markov chain framework does fit genome-wide copy number variation, determination of the specific parameters in the model can depend on the patterns of variation in the samples. thus the performance hinges on how well the actual distribution of copy number variation from experimental samples such as cancer cells, which is largely unknown, agrees with the distribution hypothesized by the model. in this study we compared carat with two methods that use hmms, namely dchip and cnag. the performance between dchip and carat is similar, while cnag tends to bias towards the normal diploid stage. in addition, dchip can not offer allele specific information in contrast to carat and cnag. however, the allele specific estimation in cnag is only feasible in matched pairs of samples and then only considers those snps that are called heterozygous in the normal matched sample. carat is free of these constraints and allele specific copy number can be estimated on any snp with any sample.

additional approaches include change-point analysis  <cit>  or posterior log likelihood  <cit>  to partition the genome into normal versus changed regions. these approaches assume that the intensity variability of probes corresponding to sub-regions of the genome is similar. however, using wgsa and the high density arrays, we observe substantial variation in the intensities of different snps. this can result from differences in snp probe sequences as well as the restriction fragment target sequences. regression on the probe gc content and the restriction fragment length stabilizes snp variability and improves sample-to-sample comparability. in addition, the use of a large normal reference set enables the intensity distribution on diploid genomes to be directly estimated at an individual snp level, thereby improving the accuracy of the model. there is also an algorithm that uses a hierarchical clustering scheme along the chromosome to identify changes. here the signal threshold is set by directly controlling the false discovery rate , providing researchers with a high level of confidence regarding their findings  <cit> . the challenge with such an approach is that a desirable fdr level can preclude the detection of moderate changes that only span a short stretch of the genome. this issue is also relevant to our algorithm in that the p-value threshold which separates significance from insignificance is determined empirically with the test set of normal individuals and with roc analyses using the 1x to 5x samples; however, there still exists a balance between detection power versus false positive rate. in addition, kernel smoothing across neighboring snps can sacrifice single point resolution. the smoothing window chosen is 100kb with a gaussian kernel where the points near the window boundary has minimum weight, rendering an average resolution of no lower than 100kb. although this resolution is high compared to traditional cgh, it is nevertheless sub-optimal compared to the average of 30kb resolution of single point analysis. these issues in part should be off-set by new advancements that allow the resolution of the high density arrays to be further increased through a decrease in feature size and increase in target dna complexity resulting in the capability to simultaneously genotype over  <dig>   <dig> snps using a pair of arrays.
