BACKGROUND
small heat shock proteins are ubiquitous, and found in the cytosol of eukaryotes as well as prokaryotes. these proteins differ from other heat shock protein families because they have a conserved amino acid sequence motif called the α-crystallin domain  <cit> . the central α-crystallin domain, consisting of about  <dig> amino acids, is highly conserved. the c-terminal domain varies from  <dig> residues in human hsp <dig> to  <dig> residues in mouse hsp <dig>  the n-terminal extension is highly variable among different shsps. it has also been shown that the c-terminal extensions have a conserved lxl/v sequence in all shsps  <cit> .

the subunit molecular mass of shsps ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> kda. however, the functional forms of all these proteins are generally multimers. most shsps form multimers from the basic monomeric structures  <cit> . unlike other bacterial and eukaryotic shsps, acr <dig> gene encoded shsp of m. tuberculosis forms a trimer of trimers and the functions of this protein have been studied extensively  <cit> . among the shsps studied, acr <dig> and acr <dig> proteins of m. tuberculosis have been studied in the context of pathogenesis as well. acr <dig> is up regulated under stress conditions such as hypoxia and s-nitrosoglutamine and ethanol treatment, but not under heat shock  <cit> . further, acr <dig> gene expression is up regulated in m. tuberculosis engulfed by macrophages activated with ifnγ. on the other hand, acr <dig> is the most up regulated protein under heat stress and induced in m. tuberculosis infecting quiescent macrophages  <cit> . acr <dig> has not been examined in detail.

based on amino acid homology, mycobacterial shsps were classified into three groups  <cit> . m. leprae shsp is a class  <dig> heat shock protein and homologs of class  <dig> shsps are found in m. smegmatis, m. marinum and m. avium  <cit> . surprisingly, streptomyces albus encodes a single shsp, which is 52% identical and 30% similar in amino acid sequence, making this the closest homolog to m. leprae shsp <dig>  this gene has been shown to be heat inducible in s. albus and confers marginal thermotolerence to the host  <cit> .

m. leprae shsp <dig> is represented among the antigenic targets of human t cell responses  <cit> , and is presumably a secreted or a surface exposed antigen, since antibodies specific for this protein are found in the sera of lepromatous leprosy patients  <cit> . our earlier report shows that the gene encoding shsp <dig> is polymorphic and about 50% of the leprosy patients carry proline residue at the 52nd position instead of serine  <cit> . however, there are no reports on the function of this protein either in vitro or in vivo. earlier report predicting that shsp <dig> could be a heat shock protein was based on indirect evidence. monoclonal antibody  against m. leprae shsp <dig> cross reacted with a protein of similar size only from m. habana among the other mycobacteria tested. this protein, presumably similar to shsp <dig> of m. leprae, could be induced at 45°c  <cit> . other stress factors such as ethanol, h2o <dig> and nalidixic acid did not induce this protein. in addition, the in vivo role of shsp <dig> has not been demonstrated directly as of now. however, the promoter segment carrying  <dig> bp upstream region along with  <dig> codons of n-terminal region was activated in macrophages, when this fragment was cloned in a promoter probe vector and expressed in m. bovis bcg strain  <cit> . this indicates that shsp <dig> is likely to be a stress inducible protein having a role in pathogenesis.

in this study, we have cloned and expressed the recombinant shsp <dig> in e. coli in order to study the nature of the protein with respect to its function. the multimerisation and chaperone activity of the protein was also examined.

RESULTS
cloning and expression of m. leprae shsp <dig> in e. coli
the gene encoding shsp <dig> was cloned in the expression vector pqe <dig> to create psa <dig>  which encoded shsp <dig> as n-terminal his-tag fusion protein. the protein was purified using nickel affinity column as described under experimental procedures. the purified protein migrated as a major band with a molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kda . an additional band of molecular weight of  <dig> kda was also observed. western blot analysis  shows that the anti-shsp <dig> antibodies recognized both proteins. the calculated molecular weight of the protein in psa <dig> is  <dig>  kda including the amino acids added during construction. exact molecular weights obtained using mass spectrometry showed a major protein of  <dig>  kda and a minor protein of  <dig>  kda. maldi-tof analysis of the tryptic digests of these two proteins excised from sds-page gels confirmed that both proteins were shsp <dig> of m. leprae .

localization of shsp <dig> in e. coli
during the extraction of shsp <dig> from induced cultures, it was found that the protein was in  <dig> rpm pellet indicating that the protein might be forming insoluble inclusion bodies. however, further analysis showed that shsp <dig> could be extracted even in  <dig> m urea , unlike other inclusion bodies . therefore, the localization of the shsp <dig> was examined. results clearly show that shsp <dig> was found predominantly in the outer membrane fraction of e. coli and a small fraction was consistently found in the periplasm as well . however the protein was not detected in inner membrane and cytoplasmic fractions . absence ompa in periplasmic fractions of 2d gels excludes the possibility of contaminating shsp <dig> and the purity of the membrane fractions was evident by the absence of shsp <dig> in inner membrane and cytoplasmic fractions .

shsp <dig> forms oligomeric structures in solution
small heat shock proteins form multimers of trimers or dimmers  <cit> , and these oligomeric structures have been shown to be the functional forms  <cit> . in order to examine the status of shsp <dig> in solution, the purified protein was dialyzed against pbs and nacl for six hours and fractionated on sephacryl column. the protein was eluted in fractions corresponding to molecular weights ~ <dig> kda and ~ <dig> kda. however, extended dialysis against pbs led to the formation of a single peak at  <dig> kda size indicating the formation of nonamers . in order to examine the presence of intermediates of the oligomeric assembly, the dialyzed protein was adjusted to  <dig>  m urea and then fractionated as described above. as shown in fig. 2a, various intermediate forms of dimer, trimer hexamers and nonamers could be detected. sds-page analysis of the individual fractions showed the presence shsp <dig> protein and the assembly process were further confirmed by gluteraldehyde cross linking . the size of this nonameric forms were confirmed against standard molecular weight markers on a native gel . the protein might have post-translational modifications and hence the resolution of native gels is not that good, only a diffuse band could be seen. however, repeated experiments confirm the results shown in fig. 2b.

shsp <dig> can act as molecular chaperone in vitro
prevention of thermal inactivation of restriction enzymes was used earlier to demonstrate the chaperone function of α-crystallin  <cit> . this assay was validated first by measuring the chaperone activity of α-crystallin under our experimental conditions. as shown in fig. 3a , α-crystallin prevents the thermal inactivation of smai and ndei. tracks  <dig> and  <dig> show that co-incubation of shsp <dig> and the restriction enzymes prevented the thermal inactivation, implying that shsp <dig> protein is as good as α-crystallin in its chaperone function. the molar ratio of the substrate to chaperone could not be calculated since the exact protein concentration of the commercial enzyme could not be determined.

further, we have analyzed the temperature range at which shsp <dig> could prevent thermal denaturation. from fig. 3b, it is clearly seen that shsp <dig> at a concentration of  <dig>  μg could prevent the thermal aggregation of smai at temperatures ranging from 30°c to 40°c. however, at 45°c, it is ineffective in preventing the inactivation, whereas,  <dig>  μg of bsa could not prevent the thermal inactivation of smai.

for checking whether the denatured shsp <dig> has chaperone activity, the protein was incubated in boiling water bath for  <dig> min before adding to the assay mixture. from fig. 3c, it is clear that preheating does not affect the chaperone function of shsp <dig> 

physical interaction of shsp <dig> with smai protein
histidine tagged shsp <dig> was bound to magnehis particles as described in experimental procedures. one dimensional gel analysis confirmed the presence of only shsp <dig> protein bound with magnehis particles. after removal of non specific proteins, heat inactivated smai was added to the shsp <dig> bound magnehis particles and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> min. the mix was washed extensively to remove nonspecifically bound smai. after washing, substrate plasmid dna was added to the magnetic beads containing bound shsp18-smai complex. as shown in fig. 4a, the plasmid dna was cleaved, indicating that smai was retained on the beads presumably through its interaction with shsp and also regained its biological activity due to the chaperone function of shsp <dig>  in the control experiment, incubation of heat denatured smai with magnehis particles, without bound shsp <dig>  did not result in binding of the restriction enzyme. similarly, native smai under the same experimental conditions failed to bind to the magnehis particles. these control experiments rule out the possibility of nonspecific binding of smai to magnehis particles . however, smai, heat inactivated at and above 45°c, was unable to bind to shsp <dig> , which implies that completely denatured proteins could not be refolded to active enzyme by shsp <dig> 

discussion
localization of shsp <dig> in e. coli
small heat shock proteins are a family of stress proteins, which were shown to act as molecular chaperones in vitro and they also play a critical role in disease conditions  <cit> . shsps are often up regulated in neurodegenerative diseases, and also in motor neuron cell injury  <cit> . the shsp <dig> of m. leprae is a major t cell antigen  <cit> , which comes under small heat shock protein family. it has been shown that shsp <dig> could be used as a diagnostic marker for m. leprae infection  <cit> . although m. leprae genome has undergone reductive evolution, it still retains the shsp <dig> gene  <cit> . our observation showed that shsp <dig> gene is expressed even in tuberculoid end of the spectrum  <cit> . this prompted us to examine the function of the protein encoded by this gene. since m. leprae is an uncultivable organism, we have cloned and expressed this protein as a fusion protein in e. coli. western blot analysis of gel separated proteins and maldi-tof analysis shows the presence of two major forms of this protein. in addition, maldi-tof analysis of the purified shsp <dig> in the linear mode shows two peaks for the  <dig>  kda form of the protein . further experiments are needed to determine the reason for this. many proteins, which are over expressed in e. coli, are shown to generally form inclusion bodies  <cit> . however, our studies show that shsp <dig> is expressed as a soluble protein. localization of the protein in e. coli showed that the major proportion of the protein was seen in membrane fraction and some amount in periplasmic fractions, but not in cytoplasmic and inner membrane fraction. further, since the survival of the recombinant e. coli over expressing the shsp <dig> is not altered , cell lysis is unlikely. these results clearly show that shsp <dig> is localized in the outer membrane of e. coli. however, e. coli being a gram-negative organism, this data needs confirmation using another mycobacterial cloning host. earlier reports  <cit>  showed the presence of shsp <dig> in cell wall and membrane fraction of armadillo derived m. leprae. membrane associated shsp <dig> could be important for modulating the immune response to infection since membrane bound but surface exposed epitopes could induce t cell as well as b cell responses , apart from their possible involvement in membrane stabilization as has been shown for the shsp <dig> of synechocystis  <cit> . in fact, the shsp  <dig> of synechocystis was shown to be an amphitrophic protein. however, since the shsps do not have signal sequences or transmembrane region, the mechanism of their transport is unclear. mambula et al. suggested three possible mechanism of release of hsp <dig> by non canonical secretion  <cit> .

self aggregation of shsp18
oligomerisation of small heat shock proteins has been reported to be essential for protein stability, which in turn enhances chaperone activity and protein-protein interactions. small heat shock proteins usually exist as oligomers of variable sizes, ranging from  <dig> kda to  <dig> kda, with each subunit being 12– <dig> kda, and appear to undergo dynamic dissociation/reassociation, with oligomeric dissociation being a prerequisite for their chaperone activities  <cit> . shsp <dig>  of m. tuberculosis is reported to form nonamers, which are assembled and reassembled via trimer and hexamer intermediates  <cit> . native form of this protein was not found to be essential for chaperone activity of the protein  <cit> . our results show the formation of oligomeric forms of shsp <dig> by gel filtration analysis. these forms correspond to the molecular weight of monomer, dimer, trimer, hexamer and nonamers. complete removal of urea by dialysis showed only a single peak of nonamers. but partial removal shows the hexameric form also. presence of trimeric forms indicates that the monomeric forms can probably form trimeric intermediates, which lead to the formation of nonameric forms through hexamer intermediates. we could see dimeric intermediates also in the assembly process, whose significance in the assembly process is yet to be clarified. however, further studies are needed to establish the structural organization of these oligomers and the interactions between specific domains that characterize these assemblies. and, also it would be interesting to examine the state of the protein in vivo.

shsp <dig> functions as a molecular chaperone in vitro
small heat shock proteins have been reported to prevent the thermal aggregation of restriction enzymes, such as ndei and smai, and help in retaining their biological activity  <cit> . in this experiment, we have analyzed the role of shsp <dig> in preventing the heat denaturation of smai and ndei. following heat treatment, the enzymatic activity was assayed using plasmid dna as substrate. thermal inactivation experiments showed that shsp <dig> could prevent the enzymes from heat inactivation indicating their ability to act as chaperone. interestingly, shsp <dig> acts as a chaperone at a concentration much lower than α-crystallin. further, shsp <dig> could also enhance the biological activity of these enzymes .

molecular chaperone activity was not lost even after the pre treatment of the shsp <dig> at 100°c for  <dig> min. similar finding was reported for m. tuberculosis hsp <dig>  as well  <cit> . protein stability is one of the most important obstacles for successful formulation in the development of new generation vaccines  <cit> . shsp <dig> of m. leprae was shown to be used as a successful vaccine delivery system  <cit> . however, the prevention of thermal inactivation of smai occurs only up to 40°c. this may be due to the fact that complete denaturation of the smai may be occurring at higher temperature  <cit>  and shsp <dig> may be able to act only on partially denatured proteins.

interaction of shsp <dig> with smai
assembly into oligomeric structures apparently is essential for the activity of shsps in vivo, since the protein oligomerises in vitro. known chaperones do not possess steric information for protein folding but inhibit unproductive folding and assembly pathways which would otherwise act as dead-end kinetic traps and produce incorrect structures. protein-protein interaction is an important aspect of the chaperone function. in our studies we were able to show that shsp <dig> could physically interact with smai and was able to restore the biological activity.

CONCLUSIONS
data in this report show that the small heat shock protein shsp <dig> of m. leprae is a molecular chaperone and shows several properties associated with other small heat shock proteins. shsp <dig> can be a useful protein as it has remarkable ability to refold proteins which have partially lost their biological activity. this protein is also shown to be capable of forming high molecular weight aggregates and taking part in protein-protein interactions. localization of the protein to the membrane compartment  is another significant discovery. these properties may help the pathogen carrying this protein in its survival under different stress conditions that they may possibly encounter after infection. direct role of molecular chaperons in infection and immunity is well documented  <cit> . membrane association of shsp18p suggests a possible role of this protein in protecting the cell and also in modulating the host immune response. since m. leprae has undergone reductive evolution and thereby lost most of its functional genes, the retention of shsp <dig> implies the importance of this protein in the survival and perhaps virulence of the bacteria.
