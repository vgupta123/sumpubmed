BACKGROUND
the first somatotopic maps of the homuncular organisation of the primary somatosensory cortex  were established in  <dig> by using intra-operative electrical stimulation of the brain surface  <cit> . subsequent, non-invasive investigations in humans on the hand representation in s <dig> have described a somatotopic organisation along the central sulcus with the thumb located laterally, anteriorly and inferiorly to the little finger  <cit> . studies in non-human primates have revealed the cytoarchitectonic subdivisions of s <dig>  namely areas 3a, 3b,  <dig> and  <dig>  that outline the cortex in the postcentral gyrus  <cit> . area 3a occupies the fundus of the central sulcus, area 3b the anterior wall of the postcentral gyrus, area <dig> its crown and area  <dig> its posterior wall. each area contains a fairly complete map of the body surface and is the cortical representation of different somatosensory receptors. in area 3b the neurons are predominantly responsive to stimulation of cutaneous receptors. as opposed to neurons in area  <dig>  that also receive input from cutaneous receptors, those in area 3b possess discrete receptive fields with a homuncular organisation that may be more distinct  <cit> .

previous studies on somatotopy in the hand area using functional magnetic resonance imaging  have yielded varying results. gelnar et al. failed to show a somatotopy in s <dig> when applying vibratory stimuli to three of the fingers of the right hand  <cit> . maldjian et al. demonstrated somatotopy in  <dig> out of  <dig> subjects  <cit> . similarly, kurth et al., using electrical stimulation of two fingers, found somatotopically arranged activation patterns in  <dig> out of  <dig> subjects  <cit> . in a follow-up study where activation of all fingers in area 3b was found in  <dig> out of  <dig> subjects, the same authors reported a general somatotopy, without further specification  <cit> .

methods differ considerably between these three studies with regard to anatomical considerations, number of subjects studied, and the field strength used. maldjian et al. used the highest field strength,  <dig> tesla , while both kurth et al. and gelnar et al. used  <dig>  t  <cit> . however, maldjian et al. did not contribute activations to any area in s <dig>  also maldjian et al. included the smallest number of subjects ; data from one were discarded due to motion artefacts and group analysis was based on data from the remaining  <dig> 

in the present study we readdressed the issue of somatotopy in the hand area as assessed with fmri. our aim was to optimise results by including a larger number of subjects, by focussing on area  <dig> b, where homuncular organisation expectedly is most distinct and by performing fmri at  <dig> tesla .

RESULTS
tactile stimulation of the fingers of the dominant hand yielded activation in contra-and ipsilateral s <dig>  contra- or bilateral secondary sensory cortex , ipsilateral cerebellum, and in some subjects the contralateral thalamus. significant activation for all five fingers in area 3b was present in seventeen subjects and these data were further analyzed. in the one volunteer excluded from the analysis, activation was present for four fingers. the spatial distribution of the activations in the contralateral s <dig> for tactile stimulation versus rest in one subject is shown in figure  <dig> 

a somatotopic organisation with the representation of the thumb located laterally to the little finger was present in  <dig> out of  <dig> subjects, with the thumb located anteriorly to the little finger in  <dig> out of  <dig> subjects and with the thumb located inferiorly to that of the little finger in  <dig> out of  <dig> subjects.

group averages of the distances from d <dig> to d <dig> , d <dig> to d <dig>  d <dig> to d <dig>  and d <dig> to d <dig>  are presented in the table and shown as graphs in figure  <dig>  combined these indicate a strict somatotopy with the distance to d <dig> increasing for every finger in each of the three directions. distances to d <dig> were compared for neighbouring fingers. in the medial-lateral direction, the distance d4-d <dig> was different from d3-d <dig>  in the anterior-posterior direction a significant difference was observed between d4-d <dig> and d3-d <dig>  finally, in the superior-inferior direction the distances d2-d <dig> and d3-d <dig> as well as d3-d <dig> and d4-d <dig> differed; the location of d <dig>  as determined by its distance to d <dig>  was different from the location of d <dig>  <cit> ; no difference was found between the distances d5-d <dig> and d4-d <dig>  considering that the three coordinates  together define one point in the 3d cartesian space, the coordinates of d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig>  differed from those of d <dig>  p now < <dig> / <dig>  corrected for multiple comparisons .

the euclidian distance from d <dig> to d <dig> was  <dig>  mm . the distance from d <dig> to d <dig> was  <dig>  mm , from d <dig> to d <dig>  <dig>  mm  and from d <dig> to d <dig>  <dig>  mm , resulting in an average for d2-d <dig>  d3-d <dig> and d4-d <dig> of  <dig>  mm.

the spatial extension of the representation of the hand in area 3b, defined as the euclidian distance between d <dig> and d <dig> was  <dig>  mm .

discussion
in the group average from the present study the strict somatotopic organisation in the primary sensory cortex known from studies using a variety of modalities, was reproduced  <cit> . the fingers' average activations were laid out on the body map, with the thumb located most laterally, anteriorly and inferiorly and the little finger most medially, posteriorly and superiorly and the remaining fingers in between, the distance to the thumb increasing for every finger in each of the three directions. in individual subjects the arrangement in the hand representation with the thumb located laterally, anteriorly and inferiorly to the little finger is frequently found, while the remaining fingers may or may not display the orderly lateral-to-medial, anterior-to-posterior and inferior-to-superior organisation 'd1-d2-d3-d4-d5'  <cit> . we chose to present group averages as it is our belief our results would have greater significance if a regular somatotopy was present at the group level. body maps in non-human primates demonstrating the regular sequence mentioned above, were established with cortical single unit recordings and are supposedly the golden standard. the present study is based on data from  <dig> subjects, generating results available for analysis from  <dig> of these; the spatial representation of all fingers in area 3b of the primary somatosensory cortex was localised in  <dig> subjects.

the average extension of the hand representation in area 3b of  <dig> mm with a somatotopic arrangement of fingers 1- <dig> as described above is consistent with results from previous studies using a range of modalities  <cit> . also the mean distance between d2-d <dig>  d3-d <dig> and d4-d <dig> of  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  mm for main and differential effects, respectively, is in good agreement with human electrophysiological and fmri data  <cit> . the larger distance between the thumb and index finger as compared to distances between subsequent fingers suggests a larger representation for the thumb. this finding is in agreement with results from a study using electrocorticography with subdural electrodes in three patients  <cit> .

with the spatial resolution used in this study,  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> mm <dig>  resampled to  <dig>  ×  <dig>  ×  <dig>  mm <dig>  activation for all five fingers was found in  <dig> of  <dig> subjects. for comparison, kurth et al. used a resolution of  <dig>  ×  <dig>  ×  <dig>  mm <dig> and electrical stimulation with ring electrodes and found activation in area 3b for all five fingers in  <dig> out of  <dig> subjects   <cit> . the present study showed activations for all fingers in  <dig> % of subjects. this difference might be due to the higher field strength used in this study as the higher magnetisation vector and sensitivity to changes in susceptibility increase the signal-to-noise ratio.

in one subject excluded from the analysis, activation was present for four fingers and another was excluded due to general lack of activation. lack of activation may be due to subjects being 'low-activators' in fmri experiments, due to inadequate stimulation or to some other, unknown factor.

the type of stimulation used is decisive of what area in s <dig> can be expected to be activated. for example, neurons in area 3a are responsive to deep receptor and proprioceptive stimulation and in one study punctate tactile stimulation did not activate area 3a  <cit> . also, receptive fields are maximally focused in area 3b, while in area  <dig> receptive fields become larger and more complex. in area  <dig>  receptive fields are even more complex with reduplications. this combined knowledge made area 3b the area of our choice to study somatotopy and explains why we chose not to report on activations in areas 3a,  <dig> and  <dig> 

we found activation in the anterior wall of the postcentral gyrus, defined as area 3b according to our operational definition during tactile stimulation . more pronounced activation was noticed frequently in the crown or posterior wall of the postcentral gyrus, defined as areas  <dig> and  <dig> . similar observations have been made in other studies using both fmri and pet  <cit> . according to studies in non-human primates the representation of the distal fingertips in area  <dig> points posteriorly, a finding confirmed in a recent fmri-study on humans  <cit> . area  <dig> then is the mirror-image of area  <dig> with the fingertips pointing anteriorly. the activation in the posterior wall might represent activation in both areas  <dig> and  <dig> localised at their meeting point, i.e. the fingertips. the larger cluster size of this activation is explained by the clusters arising from area  <dig> and  <dig> being contiguous and therefore additive. in the present study the activation of area  <dig> and  <dig> is probably due to hierarchical processing in the rostrocaudal direction within s <dig>  a previous observation that electrical stimulation of the cutaneous afferents of the median nerve resulted in evoked potentials in area 3b after  <dig> msec while a potential in area  <dig> was seen after another  <dig> msec lends support to this assumption  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in the group analysis, a somatotopic organisation for all the fingers in the hand representation of area 3b could be demonstrated using fmri; the euclidian distance between the thumb and the little finger was well comparable to that determined in previous studies. on the subject level the cortical somatosensory representation of the thumb was located laterally, anteriorly, and inferiorly to that of the little finger in  <dig> out of  <dig> subjects. the spatial localisation of the remaining fingers showed a less stringent somatotopic order when compared individually.
