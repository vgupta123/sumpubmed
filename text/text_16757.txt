BACKGROUND
atlantic salmon  is a fish native to the basin of the north atlantic ocean. as farming of atlantic salmon is growing as an agricultural enterprise, identification of genetic regions and genes responsible for economically important traits might be of importance for future agriculture of salmon.

genome projects in farm animals aim at identifying regions of the genome responsible for traits of economic importance in order to implement this into breeding and management programs. this is for instance achieved by performing qtl studies to identify genomic regions that are linked to traits of economic importance. genetic and physical maps, publicly available databases and cdna libraries from various tissues are a few of the tools needed to identify genomic regions responsible for traits of interest. currently there are two published linkage maps for atlantic salmon  <cit>  and several est databases available to the public  <cit> . after a genomic region has been shown to be linked to a trait of economic importance, a high quality bac library resource is crucial in the identification and functional characterization of the genetic variation.

atlantic salmon along with all fish of the family salmonidae shows residual tetraploidity after a duplication event that occurred 25â€“ <dig> myr ago  <cit> . however, rapid chromosome divergence has been observed between different salmonid species, involving robertsonian changes as well as other structural rearrangements  <cit> . hence, the pseudo-tetraploid state is challenging for researchers working with the atlantic salmon genome.

here we describe the construction and characterization of a highly redundant bac library of atlantic salmon. to our knowledge, this is the first reported atlantic salmon bac library, which will be an important tool for constructing physical maps and in the identification and sequencing of regions of the salmon genome. the large insert bac clones will be useful as to provide better understanding of the pseudo-tetraploid state, identify regions of interest to the aquaculture industry as well as to the basic science community.

RESULTS
the current bac library, chori  <dig>  consists of three segments. the average insert size was estimated based upon analysis of noti digested dna isolated from  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> clones from segment  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively. the distribution of insert sizes is presented in figure  <dig>  based on these results, the average insert size was estimated to be  <dig> kbp. with a total of approximately  <dig>  <dig> clones the bac library provides  <dig>  haploid genome equivalents  given a genome size of  <dig>  pg   <cit>  or similar  <dig>  pg at the genome size database  <cit> .

genomic dna obtained from salmon sperm was partially digested with ecori restriction enzyme and cloned in ptarbac <dig>  vector.

 <dig> estimated numbers for each segment is based upon noti digestion.

 <dig>  <dig> out of  <dig> clones were identified as non-insert clones

 <dig>  <dig> out of  <dig> clones were identified as non-insert clones

 <dig>  <dig> out of  <dig> clones were identified as non-insert clones

 <dig> recombinant clones have been estimated from the total well number subtracting non-insert clones, non-recombinant clones and empty wells.

in the construction of the library, great care was made to estimate the amount of enzymes to be used for the digestion and dephosphorylation of the vector. excessive amounts of either enzyme showed an increase in ligation products containing non-insert clones with a smaller vector fragment. these products are possibly due to star activity and deletion in the sacb gene or its promoter region, causing the clones to survive on media containing sucrose. the number of non-insert clones were estimated to represent about 2% of the library based upon the results from the noti digestion analysis . nine non-recombinant clones, which contain the complete bac vector only, were detected in the entire library by hybridization using puc <dig> dna onto the filter sets. reducing the frequency of non-recombinant and non-insert clones is important as these clones can easily dominate the clone collection of the library due to reduced transformation efficiency of large dna fragments in e. coli. high frequency of non-insert and non-recombinant clones will increase the cost for storage and utilization of the library. in addition, large scale random fingerprinting and sequencing will have a significant reduced cost using libraries with low frequency of non-insert and non-recombinant clones.

to further characterize the library, a set of  <dig> oligo probes generated from sequence flanking known non-linked microsatellite markers was selected to be used in screening of the  <dig> bac library colony filters. these filters contain the complete bac library gridded in duplicate. in an attempt to reduce the probability of these probes to contain repeat sequences, each probe was hybridized to one bac filter in order to check the quality of the probe as a unique marker. from these test hybridizations, in combination with southern blots of genomic dna digested with taqi, psti and mspi,  <dig> probes were characterized as unique with  <dig> to  <dig> signals onto a single bac filter and single bands onto the genomic filters . the three enzymes taqi, psti and mspi were chosen because of a high frequency of restriction sites for these enzymes in the salmon genome. as many as  <dig> of the  <dig> probes yielded several hundreds to thousands of positive double signals onto one bac filter and multiple bands or smear onto the genomic southern blots indicating that the probes contained repetitive sequence elements.

the  <dig> probes, which were assumed not to contain repeat elements based on the initial hybridization results, were hybridized as one pool to the filters and resulted in the identification of  <dig> positive bac clones. to identify the relationships between the probes and the clones, a second hybridization experiment was performed for each probe individually onto new small nylon filters containing all  <dig> clones. out of the  <dig> bac clones identified in the primary screening,  <dig> were verified in these secondary screening experiments . in addition, all the clones that were not assigned to a probe in the second hybridization experiments, possible false positives, were analyzed individually in pcr experiments with all the microsatellite pcr primer pairs, resulting in the assignment of an additional  <dig> bac clones to the microsatellite markers . see additional file  <dig> for a complete data set of bac clones linked to each microsatellite marker.

# weak smear was observed from bac template and genomic dna

furthermore, we also screened the chori  <dig> bac library using probes specific to known expressed sequences. hence,  <dig> overgos were constructed from atlantic salmon est sequences . these probes were hybridized to the bac filters as one pool, and  <dig> bac clones were verified as positive for the  <dig> probes after a second hybridization experiment. all the bac clones were fingerprinted in order to provide additional information about their organization. the fingerprinting results generated multiple contigs for  <dig> of the probes while the clones for the last probe resulted in six single clones. out of the  <dig> clones,  <dig> clones were not mapped into contigs and are here referred to as singletons. the observation of singletons is either caused by clones containing small insert sizes, possible false positives or lower quality dna loaded onto the agarose gel. the fpc software will not be able to map small insert clones into contigs using the selected cut off value. for a complete data set of bac clones linked to each gene marker and the respective fingerprinting contigs see additional file  <dig> 

contigs with  <dig> or more clones are shown

an average of  <dig> bac clones was observed in the screening of the est derived overgo probes, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bac clones and  <dig> contigs on average for each of these probes. however, the results obtained using the genomic oligos resulted in an average of  <dig>  clones after secondary hybridization screening, and an average of  <dig> clones from pcr verification . the average observed with the genomic probes corresponds to the estimated genome coverage of  <dig>  fold. because of selection pressure one would expect duplicated expressed dna sequences to be more preserved than non-coding sequences. consequently, probes containing expressed sequences might more often identify the pseudo-duplicated regions  than non-coding probes. however, using fingerprinting, these pseudo-duplicated regions containing restriction enzyme differences might still be mapped to different contigs. observation of multiple fingerprinting contigs has previously been reported in a bac library for rainbow trout , a member of the salmonidae family, using gene and est probes in screening of the library  <cit> . the authors present their results as evidence of locus duplication in rainbow trout. our results are in agreement with these findings  <cit> . our approach, using both expressed sequences as well as non-coding sequences, might be more suited in characterization of bac libraries of pseudo-ploidity state genomes than expressed sequences exclusively.

CONCLUSIONS
we have constructed a bac library from atlantic salmon . based on the number of clones and the observed average insert size of  <dig> kb, we estimate the library to have in excess of 18-fold genome representation.

providing a publicly available highly redundant genomic large insert library for atlantic salmon is important for several reasons. first, genomic large insert clones can be used to construct contigs for regions of interest, fingerprinted in large scale and thus create large physical maps of the salmon genome, or be used in shotgun sequencing approaches. secondly, utilizing one library would be important in exchange of data between researchers. the characterization reported here illustrates the usefulness of the library in identifying genomic clones and the possibility of utilizing clones in fingerprinting analysis. the very large average insert size of the clones combined with the high redundancy will provide researchers with a possibility of obtaining complete gene sequences within a single bac clone. this might be useful for expression studies of genes and their regulatory elements. the bac library of atlantic salmon will be an important tool for future salmon projects and to the salmon industry.
