BACKGROUND
daphnia pulex is a key player in the aquatic ecosystems and an important component in the food web. it is a model organism for studying environmental challenges including toxic conditions  <cit> . d. pulex is the first crustacean whose genome was sequenced  <cit> . the crustaceans and insects have diverged from a common ancestor. nevertheless, they exhibit extraordinary levels of phenotypic diversity. there are  <dig>  model proteins, 95% of them are named 'putative uncharacterized'. over a third of the sequences lack homologues  <cit> , and thus are considered novel genes. a detailed analysis on the evolutionary trends of daphnia genome indicates that extensive gene duplication events occurred. importantly, many of these duplicated genes are under purifying selection  <cit> . it was proposed that the amount of duplicated genes reflects the harsh living environments of the family daphniidae. specifically, genes that appear in tandem duplicated clusters are significantly over-represented in transcriptomes from extreme ecological conditions  <cit> .

comparative genomics approaches are useful for the discovery of functional elements from newly sequenced genomes  <cit> . such methods were successfully used for complete sequenced drosophilae   <cit> , and genomes from various yeast strains  <cit> . daphnia is the only available crustacean sequenced genome. thus, the value of a comparative genomics research from its related proteomes  might be somewhat limited.

protonet is a global automatic classification scheme for the entire protein space  <cit> . protonet  <dig>  provides a hierarchical organization of  <dig> million protein sequences  <cit> . the hierarchy results from an unsupervised clustering method that groups proteins according to their mutual similarity. the resulting hierarchy consists of protein clusters that are arranged into several trees. each such tree represents a protein family at a different granularity - from a broad superfamily to a specialized subfamily  <cit> . following pruning of the protonet  <dig>  family tree, the system reports on ~ <dig>  high quality stable clusters . protonet was applied successfully as a complementary methodology for annotating newly sequenced genomes  <cit> . the incorporation of external annotation sources that cover structure, function, domain and taxonomy perspectives leads to impartial biological knowledge and functional inference  <cit> .

in this study, we claim that the scaffold of protonet can be successfully used for annotating the daphnia full-length proteome. we show that by applying strict filters on the protonet tree and adding a number of constrains for functional inference, we could safely map to preexisting clusters  <dig> % of the daphnia's proteome. for 87% of the mapped proteome, functional annotations were securely assigned. we show that the daphnia proteins are clustered into ~ <dig> clusters, but only 40% of these clusters include insects' representatives. most  of the proteins are mapped to ~ <dig> clusters that contain at least  <dig> daphnia's paralogs. we consider the function of the clusters that are exceptionally amplified relative to the fruitfly proteome and those that are maximally enriched in the daphnia's proteome. we focus on ion channels and cuticle structural families that dominate the amplified duplicated genes. we discuss the relevance of gene expansions and the potential of the organisms to cope with the changing environment.

RESULTS
automatic mapping of the daphnia proteome
the fully sequenced daphnia pulex proteome comprises of  <dig>  open reading frames . we limited the analysis to  <dig>   proteins that are full length. we mapped these proteins to the protonet tree  that was pruned to ensure high confidence clusters. two parameters govern the validity of protonet families :  the protolevel  that determines the depth of the tree. pl =  <dig> indicates the proteins as singletons and pl =  <dig> marks the protonet root with the maximal number of merges at the root of the tree.  the lifetime  is an intrinsic measure that approximates the stability of the clusters . lt =  <dig> refer to a full representation of all clusters, i.e. a binary tree with the number of clusters that are identical to the number of protein within . lt =  <dig> is the default for semi-stable clusters. towards the goal of mapping the daphnia proteome to top confident clusters, we determined the lt . following mapping, we 'climb' the tree to a higher level of the hierarchy . the trimmed protonet at pl =  <dig> is called proroot <dig> . the pruned and compressed protonet is used as the scaffold for the annotation task. each proroot <dig> root is conjectured to represent a functional family.

we mapped the daphnia's proteins to:  the minimal-sized cluster from the protonet  <dig>  that met the merging criteria  <cit> ;  the predefined criteria of lt =  <dig>  all together, we mapped  <dig>  daphnia's protein sequences to  <dig>  clusters . only  <dig> proteins  failed in their mapping. figure 2b shows that the mapping of the daphnia's proteins occurs at all levels of the tree, as indicated by the pl index. among the  <dig>  proteins, only  <dig> were mapped at pl>  <dig> . we will not discuss these proteins due to their questionable quality. in summary, less than 2% of the daphnia full-length proteins failed our annotation scheme.

in order to achieve a global taxonomic view of the daphnia proteome, we took two perspectives:  a protein-based view: each of the  <dig>  daphnia sequences belongs to one of the proroot <dig> roots. proteins assigned to the same root belong to the same functional family. for each protein, we check whether it has homologues from the mouse and the fruitfly .  a root-based view: in proroot <dig>   <dig> clusters contain at least one daphnia's mapped protein. among the proroot <dig> trees,  <dig> clusters contain at least  <dig> daphnia's proteins. for each proroot <dig>  we check whether it contains proteins from the mouse, fruitfly or other organisms, in addition to the daphnia proteins. the mouse and the fruitfly were selected as representatives for complex, 'complete proteomes'. in addition, these organisms differ considerably in their evolution history, mutation rate, generation time and other parameters that govern their protein families .

we repeated the mapping protocol and thresholds as used for the daphnia proteome for mapping the  <dig>  and  <dig>  full-length proteins from the fruitfly and the mouse, respectively. figure  <dig> shows the results in a venn diagram. as expected, a large majority  of the proteins have homologues in the mouse and the fruitfly. interestingly, a substantial fewer roots associate with the d. melanogaster proteome . about 40% of daphnia's clusters include also proteins from the fruitfly. notably, the fraction of proteins for  or  is identical, with 6% of the daphnia proteome in each cross-taxa groups .

the proteome of the daphnia includes many previously unseen proteins that have no homology to mouse or to the fruitfly . importantly, these  <dig> proteins  are mapped to proroot <dig> that include other organisms. the number of proteins that are unique to the fruitfly or the mouse comprises 17% of their analyzed proteome . an interesting subset of proteins is the group of proteins that failed mapping . these proteins are potentially daphnia specific proteins. however, these are prone to mistakes in genome annotations, and therefore, will not be further discussed.

automatic annotations of the daphnia proteome
the principle underlying the assignment of annotations to the uncharacterized daphnia proteome relies of the functional coherence in the proroot <dig> set. previous quality assessment showed that the clusters of protonet are of high quality in view of their annotations  <cit> . the sources for the automatic functional annotation task cover the standardized vocabulary of gene ontology  , uniprot keywords . we use the concept of protoname for the annotations that best describe the cluster's proteins . recall that each cluster in protonet is associated with many annotations. thus, a representative cluster in protonet will have a rich 'composed protoname'. we included filters for securing the confidence of the annotation inference process:  specificity for the cluster is ≥  <dig> ;  the cluster size is ≥  <dig> proteins. using the filtration scheme, we were able to assign annotations for 73% of the proroot <dig>  with an average of  <dig>  annotations per proroo <dig>  figure  <dig> shows the annotation sources according to all the terms used. importantly, the annotation assignment is based on a fully automated procedure. the  <dig> branches of the go terms dominate the annotations of the daphnia proteome. each of the sequence-based resources  contributes additional 5-8% of annotations .

we tested the quality of the proroot <dig> clusters that include daphnia's proteins, using the specificity score . the average specificity score for all interpro terms  is  <dig>  . this high specificity is a strong support for the quality of our automatic inference procedure.

the assignment of high quality annotations with a taxonomical view  allowed focusing on the functions that dominate the , and the complementary group . table  <dig> shows the sample of the largest proroot <dig> trees. we show that, the  families are rich with extracellular domains, proteases, heat shock proteins and calcium binding proteins. on the other hand, the  trees include representatives of the sensory apparatus .

most daphnia's proteins have paralogs
following mapping of the full-length proteome in  <dig> clusters , we found that  <dig>  proteins  were mapped to clusters that contain paralogs  at the level of proroot <dig>  we tested the paralogs at the level of map <dig> . notably, most of the map10-clusters are at the granularity of families. these clusters often merge to bigger clusters that form families and superfamilies at the proroot <dig> level. about 24% of the map <dig> clusters  include daphnia's paralogs . notably, there are  <dig> clusters with ≥  <dig> paralogs and  <dig> clusters with >  <dig> paralogs .

we tested the degree by which the daphnia's proteins are separated or intermix with the other proteins at their map <dig> cluster. the extreme case in which daphnia proteins within the cluster remain as a separated sub-tree correlates well with a trend of low divergence. we tested the relation of daphnia's proteins with respect to the other proteins in the mapped cluster using the tree score . briefly, for each cluster that includes daphnia's paralog at map <dig> , we run blast in 'all against all' mode and create a distance binary tree . for each tree, we computed the ts. it is simply the number of daphnia proteins in the cluster proteins  divided by the size of the cluster  of the minimum subtree that contain all the daphnia proteins . the ts ranges from  <dig>  to a small positive value. when the lower common ancestor that combined all daphnia's paralogs of the cluster is the root of the subtree , the score is minimal.

using the ts, we indirectly estimated the conservation relative to the size of the cluster subtree that contains all of the daphnia's proteins within. we identified  <dig> clusters of ts =  <dig> . high ts is indicative of the 'isolation' of the daphnia's proteins from the other members in the cluster. 54% of the daphnia's paralogs are associated with high divergence . we examine the map <dig> clusters that contain a large number of daphnia's proteins . such clusters are spread at all ranges of the tss . when the same analysis was performed on drosophila melanogaster map <dig> clusters, the dominating tss are typically <  <dig> , and no cases of high tss were noted . the results suggest that in daphnia , paralogs having low divergence in view of other proteins in the clusters are prevalent. a quantitative comparison of the paralogs in drosophila and daphnia was performed. the number of proroot <dig> roots that contain paralogs is  <dig> and  <dig> in daphnia and drosophila, respectively. the relation of the ts and the tree size  is shown for daphnia .

functional view on daphnia's families with amplified paralogs
we inspected the annotations that are associated with clusters having a high number of duplicated genes . the results show that these clusters are rich with viral origin, apparently as relics of transposition events   <cit> . other such families include structural proteins of the cuticle and the cytoskeleton, large families of enzymes , and various signaling receptors .

a taxonomical imbalance of daphnia paralogs
based on the completeness of the daphnia's genomes, we could focus on protein families that are characterized by a taxonomically imbalanced. specifically, proroot <dig> trees that contain a high proportion of daphnia:fly proteins may suggest gene amplifications that support essential function in daphnia. in order to highlight taxonomically imbalanced clusters, we defined a taxonomical balance score .

the tb test indicates the relevance of this measure to the behavior and the environmental difference between the fruitfly and the daphnia. for example, the essential requirements for stress response elements in daphnia are exposed through the dapnia:fly tb score.

manual evaluation: plasma membrane receptors and ion channels
inspecting the proroot <dig> trees that contain a large number of daphnia's proteins revealed families that are particularly enriched with receptors and signaling proteins. we consider three such families that are characterized by a high ratio of the number of paralogs  relative to map <dig> clusters  and a high tb value relative to the fly . we focus on the amplifications of ion channels and receptors.

the assignment of a large group of daphnia's paralogs to the ionotropic glutamate receptors is intriguing. daphnia's representatives were found for each of the three subclasses of glutamate receptor :  the nmda  receptors are highly permeable for ca2+ ions. nmda receptors play a key role in the plasticity of the nervous system.  the ampa  receptors that are the most commonly found receptors in the nervous system, and  the kainate receptors.

proroot <dig> tree with a protoname of 'ionotropic glutamate receptor'  includes  <dig> of the daphnia's paralogs. the interpro term covers 140/ <dig> instances. the surprisingly high prevalence of glutamate receptors  is most likely to control the excitatory synaptic transmission in the crustacean brain. specifically, transient activation of nmda receptors leads to a modification in the strength of synaptic transmission mediated by ampa and kainate receptors. the ionotropic glutamate receptors are ancient in evolution. events of genes loss and gain were reported for these genes along the phylogenetic tree  <cit> . a collection of  <dig> related gene products in daphnia has the potential for a rich combinatorial array of ion channels and sensors.

another functional group includes the daphnia's paralogs identified as bestrophin. the bestrophin is a family of plasma membrane proteins that express in the retinal pigment epithelial cells. mutations in the homologous human gene cause 'best macular dystrophy' disease. bestrophins compose a new class of chloride channels that are restricted to multicellular metazoa. daphnia's paralogs mapped to the largest bestrophin subfamily . in this subfamily, the other proteins are from the fruitfly  and caenorhabditis .

a remarkable amplification is detected for the  <dig> daphnia's proteins that are mapped to ryanodine receptors  and inositol  <dig> ,5-trisphosphate receptors  protonet family. these proteins belong to the superfamily of ligand-gated intracellular ca2+ channels. the ryr and ip3r control the ca2+ homeostasis of the cells and are essential in neurons, muscle and other secreting cells. the ip <dig> receptor acts as a ca2+ release channel from internal stores in smooth muscle and non-muscle tissues. however, at high ca2+ concentrations in the cytosol, ip <dig> receptors are inhibited. such inhibition is an essential mechanism for terminating the channel activity and thus preventing pathological ca2+ rises.

the overwhelming number of daphnia's proteins  is restricted to the domains that characterize these receptors. the average length of the cluster is  <dig> ±  <dig> amino acids. however, the length of the  <dig> daphnia paralogs is only  <dig> ±  <dig> amino acids. phylogenetic tree based on a multiple sequence alignment  of daphnia protein e9hhk <dig> is shown . note that the daphnia proteins are intermixed with ip <dig> receptors from other organisms including the drosophila, ades , trichoplax, ixodes  and more . for the msa see additional file  <dig> 

discussion
most methods for functional inference are biased towards the detection of the 'known space' and fail in detecting novel families. a unique aspect of the protonet method is the fact that it is unsupervised. we mapped the daphnia uncharacterized proteome to protonet  <dig> . once a new genome is sequenced, there are several tasks that may be performed with the goal of functional assignment. these approaches include  alignment-based comparative genomics;  matching to predetermined statistical models . domain and family-based resources provide an excellent coverage of the 'known space' using hmms . iterative search using pssm and hmm profiles are often used for a comprehensive functional inference. however, all these methods consider each protein as a separate entity. thus, a global perspective of the analyzed proteome is lost.

a growing number of proteomes, many of them are isolated in the species tree, become available. in the current study, intrinsic features of the data  guide the functional assignment. specifically, the composed protoname captures the most significant annotations . protoname is linked to the majority of the stable clusters  <cit> . we suggest that our annotation process, in conjunction with supervised methods will provide a maximal coverage. protonet  <dig>  serves as the scaffold for the daphnia annotation. the db including all the external expert annotations  will be updated each year. it will be beneficial to retest the performance sensitivity of inference following an update for all these resources. it will serve to assess the functional inference quality in view of the gradual improvement in external knowledge.

a similar approach, called protobee, was applied for annotating the honey bee proteome  <cit> . protobee tree was constructed from about  <dig>  proteins including  <dig>  proteins from the honey bee. about 70% of the bee's proteins were successfully annotated in this task  <cit> . our current strategy for annotation assignment is based on mapping the  <dig>  daphnia's proteins on a scaffold of protonet  <dig>  tree-like structure. almost  <dig> million proteins are included in such a family tree. the success in annotating the daphnia proteome covers 86% of the full-length proteome, despite the high percentage of proteins that lack known homologues. the enhanced performance in annotating the daphnia proteome stems from the use of  <dig> millions sequences from all domains of life. furthermore, the number of external annotations such as interpro and go terms was almost doubled in the  <dig> years from the protobee project  <cit> . we conclude that the drastic increase in data improved the performance of genome size automatic annotations.

in this study, we applied a taxonomical view to identify the unique clusters of crustaceans. in this view,  and  clusters are of a special interest . these sets account for functions that were lost/gain after the separation of crustaceans from insects. the taxonomical view provides an insight on genes that fulfill the daphnia's unique needs. evidence from other related genomes will be needed to substantiate the trends of gene loss and gain in crustaceans.

a large fraction of the daphnis's proteome includes amplified genes. instead of searching the proteins that meet an artificial predetermined threshold , we mapped proteins to their most reliable cluster  and followed their merges along the tree hierarchy. we identified that a fraction of the daphnia's paralogs is characterized by a low divergence . these paralogs are not mixed with other proteins in the cluster. however, such property was not detected among drosophila's paralogs . we assume that the daphnia's paralogs that have high tb score reflect the dynamics of the daphnia genome. the prevalence of proteins related to viral infection and transposition supports our hypothesis.

we determine hundreds of daphnia's paralogs . it was noted that daphnia pulex's genome appears to have twice as many gene duplication events with respect to the duplicate-rich c. elegans genome  <cit> . gene duplication in c. elegans occurred more frequently than in drosophila or yeast. analysis for gene duplications in ryanodine receptors  and ip3r  indicates that ryr and ip3r are spread in small groups of 2- <dig> genes at a chromosomal proximity. such organization applies to many of the daphnia's paralogs  <cit> .

the tb score is designed to track the extreme instances of imbalance in the number of daphnia's paralogs. we used the d. melanogaster as a reference for a model organism whose annotation is supported by experimental evidence. the striking enrichment in daphnia's proteins, using the tb measure, includes cuticle structural elements , transposon proteins and various ion channels . analysis of the chemoreceptors  <cit>  suggests that the ionic glutamate receptors belong to a fast evolving superfamily. similar observations for expanded gene families were reported for daphnia abc transporters  <cit> , transposon proteins  <cit>  and the cytochrome p <dig>  <cit> . it is anticipated that a network of sensing and signaling molecules is essential for daphnia's environmental response and acclimation against environmental toxicity.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we present a novel method that combines both the tasks of comparative analysis and automatic annotation. one unique aspect of the clustering method used is the fact that it is an unsupervised method. the protocol presented is useful in the annotation task of further genomes, especially in the case that there are no other related genomes in the public domain.

the uncharacterized daphnia's proteome was mapped successfully to thousands of protein families. for 81% of these families, the functional inference from various external resources was successful.

an unbalanced taxonomical outlook for daphnia proteome in view of the fruitfly as a model organism was instrumental to identify genes' amplification in daphnia. these expanded protein families may underlie the capacity of daphnia to cope with the environmental toxicity, oxygen availability, wide temperature range and other harsh conditions.
