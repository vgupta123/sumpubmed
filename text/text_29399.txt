BACKGROUND
human embryonic stem  cell lines were derived from the inner cell mass of human blastocysts, and were cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblast  feeder to maintain undifferentiated growth, extensive renewal capacity, and pluripotency, including the ability to form teratomas in scid mice and embryoid bodies in vitro  <cit> . the hes cells were later shown to be able to retain their fundamental characteristics by culturing on matrigel in mef-conditioned medium, and this feeder-free culture system is suitable for scale up production of undifferentiated hes cells  <cit> . in addition to their contribution to basic research such as stem cell biology and early human development, hes cells have great potential as source of cells for therapeutic uses. in order to reduce the risks of cross-transfer of pathogens from xenogeneic feeder or conditioned medium, an autogeneic feeder cell system, comprising fibroblast-like cells differentiated from hes cells, was developed to grow undifferentiated and pluripotent hes cells for their medical applications  <cit> . a feeder-free culture using medium conditioned by autogeneic feeder cells is desirable in order to use hes cells as tools for drug development and toxicity testing.

in our laboratory, five hes cell lines had been derived  <cit> , and one line hes-t <dig> with normal female karyotype was used to establish autogeneic feeder cells with capacity to support the growth of undifferentiated hes cells  <cit> . in this investigation, a feeder-free culture on matrigel in medium conditioned by these autogeneic feeder cells was established to maintain the undifferentiated growth of hes cells, and the gene expression profiles of mrnas, micrornas  and proteins were further shown to be very similar between the undifferentiated hes cells grown on autogeneic feeder and its conditioned medium, as well as mef feeder and mef-conditioned medium.

methods
undifferentiated growth of hes cells on mef feeder and mef-conditioned medium
human embryonic stem cell line hes-t <dig>  which is one of the five hes cell lines derived in our laboratory with institutional review board approval and informed consent by couples undergoing ifv treatment in taiwan  <cit> , exhibits normal female karyotype , and it has been continuously cultured on mitomycin c  mitotically inactivated mef feeder in hes medium under 5% co <dig> at 37°c and underwent freezing/thawing processes. the hes culture medium consisted of dmem/f <dig>  supplemented with 20% ksr , 1% non-essential amino acids,  <dig> mm l-glutamine,  <dig>  mm β-mercaptoethanol, and  <dig> ng/ml human basic fibroblast growth factor . routine passages of hes-t <dig> cells every 5- <dig> days were done with collagenase  treatment and mechanical scrape  <cit> . the cryopreserved stock of hes-t <dig> cells  were continuously maintained on mef feeder for additional  <dig> passages, and these the hes-t <dig> cells were designated as t3/mef  <cit> .

the mef cells were cultured in mef medium overnight, and the mitotically inactivated mef cells were maintained in hes medium containing  <dig> ng/ml bfgf. after  <dig> h, the mef-conditioned medium was collected and filtered through  <dig>  um membrane  as previously described  <cit> . the culture dish was coated with matrigel diluted with dmem/f <dig>  overnight at 4°c. the cryopreserved stock of hes-t <dig> cells  were continuously maintained on feeder-free matrigel-coated dish in mef-conditioned medium  for  <dig> passages, and these hes-t <dig> cells were designated as t3/cmmef  <cit> .

establishment of human hes-t <dig> differentiated fibroblast-like cells
autogeneic feeder cells with capacity to support the growth of undifferentiated hes cells were established according to the previously published procedure  <cit> . hes-t <dig>  cells were transferred into feeder-free and noncoated plate  in dmem supplemented with 10% fbs  under 5% co <dig> at 37°c. after  <dig> days, cells appeared as fibroblast-like morphology, that is, flat cells with elongated nucleus and branching pseudopodia. these hes-t <dig> differentiated fibroblast-like cells are designated as t3hdf. the expression of transcription factors oct <dig>  sox <dig> and nanog, which were highly expressed in t3/mef cells, was shown to be down-regulated in differentiated t3hdf cells. the expression profiles of mrnas and mirnas between t3/mef and t3hdf cells were also found to very different  <cit> . these t3hdf cells were passaged using trypsin  every  <dig> days or cryopreserved.

undifferentiated growth of hes cells on t3hdf feeder and t3hdf-conditioned medium
the differentiated fibroblast-like t3hdf cells  were inactivated using mitomycin c  and used as autogeneic feeder layer in hes medium to maintain the continuously undifferentiated growth of hes-t <dig> cells  for additional  <dig> passages  <cit> . these hes-t <dig> cells grown on t3hdf feeder were designated as t3/hdf.

the t3hdf cells were cultured in dmem medium overnight, and the mitotically inactivated t3hdf were maintained in hes medium containing  <dig> ng/ml bfgf. after  <dig> h, the t3hdf-conditioned medium was collected and filtered through  <dig>  um membrane  <cit> . the culture dish was coated with matrigel diluted with dmem/f <dig>  overnight at 4°c. the hes-t <dig> cells  were first grown on t3hdf feeder for  <dig> passages and then on matrigel in t3hdf-conditioned medium for additional  <dig> passages. the hes-t <dig> cells grown on feeder-free matrigel-coated dish in t3hdf-conditioned medium  were designated as t3/cmhdf

staining of oct <dig> and nanog
t3/hdf and t3/cmhdf, as well as t3/mef and t3/cmmef, colonies were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized using  <dig> % triton x- <dig> in the culture dishes. the immunostaining with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human oct <dig>  and nanog  were detected with goat anti-rabbit igg as described previously  <cit> .

extraction of total rnas
total rnas from approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> cells of t3/hdf and t3/cmhdf on  <dig> cm plate were extracted using trizol reagent, and the same total rnas from each sample were used for both mrna microarray analysis and mirna quantification.

mrna microarray analysis
the mrna profilings of t3/hdf and t3/cmhdf cells were analyzed using affymetrix human genome u <dig> plus  <dig>  genechip according to the manufacturer's protocols  by the microarray core facility of national research program for genomic medicine of national science council in taiwan as previously described  <cit> . this affymetrix genechip contains  <dig>  probe sets to analyze the expression levels of  <dig>  transcripts and variants, including  <dig>  well-characterized human genes. genechips from the hybridization experiments were read by the affymetrix genechip scanner  <dig>  and raw data were processed using affymetrix genechip operating software mas <dig>  and its default analysis parameters. the raw data were also analyzed by genespring gx software version  <dig> . <dig> . the correlation coefficients of gene probes expressed between any two samples were calculated from the normalized values by using genechip-robust multiarray average  algorithm. it may be noted that affymetrix genechip expression analysis can be used as a stand-alone quantitative comparison, since the correlation between affymetrix genechip results and tagman rt-qpcr results was shown in a good linearity of r <dig> =  <dig>  by the microarray quality control study, a collaborative effort of  <dig> scientists led by the us-fda  <cit> . a hierarchical clustering and principle component analysis  of the eight affymetrix genechip data from duplicates of four populations of hes cells were also performed in order to check the quality of microarray results.

analyses of signaling pathways and go process networks
the abundantly  expressed mrnas of t3/hdf and t3/cmhd, as well as t3/mef and t3/cmmef, cells were analyzed for signaling pathways and go process networks by using metacore analytical suite  as previously described  <cit> . the metacore includes a curated database of human protein interaction and metabolism, and thus it is useful for analyzing a cluster of genes in the context of regulatory network and signaling pathways.

quantification of mirnas
the expression levels of  <dig> human mirnas from t3/hdf and t3/cmhd cells were determined using the taqman microrna assays   <cit> . the detailed procedure for mirna quantification was previously described  <cit> . in brief, tagman microrna assays include two steps: stem loop rt followed by real-time pcr.  each  <dig> ul rt reaction that includes  <dig> ng total rna,  <dig> nm stem-loop rt primers, 1× rt buffer,  <dig>  mm each of dntps,  <dig>  u/ul rnase inhibitor, and  <dig> u/ul multiscribe reverse transcriptase was incubated in the ptc- <dig> peltier thermal cycler  for  <dig> min each at 16°c and at 42°c, followed by  <dig> min at 85°c, and then held at 4°c. rt products were diluted twenty times with h2o prior to setting up pcr reaction. real-time pcr for each mirna was carried out in triplicates, and each  <dig> ul reaction mixture included  <dig> ul of diluted rt product,  <dig> ul of 2× tagman universal pcr master mix and  <dig>  um tagman probe, respectively. the reaction was incubated in an applied biosystems 7900ht sequence detection system at 95°c for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> sec and 60°c for  <dig> min. the threshold cycle  is defined as the fraction cycle number at which the fluorescence exceeds the fixed threshold of  <dig> . total rna input was normalized based on the ct values of the tagman u <dig> snrna assay as an endogenous control. the fold change was calculated as 2-Δct × k, where -Δct = - and k is a constant.

2d-gel analysis of proteins
approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> hes cells on  <dig> cm plate were washed twice each with 1× pbs and cell wash buffer, and then lyzed using np <dig> lysis buffer.  <dig> ml ice-cold acetone/11% w/v trichloroacetic acid / <dig> mm dtt was added per  <dig>  ml solubilised sample and incubated for a minimum of  <dig> min at -20°c. the precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation , washed twice with  <dig> ml cold acetone containing  <dig> mm dtt, and then air-dried to remove residual acetone. the resulting protein pellet was then resolubilised in the appropriate rehydration buffer . the concentration of proteins in the sample was measured by the bradford method.

isoelectricfocusing was performed using an ettan ipgphor ii .  <dig> cm immobiline drystrips  were rehydrated overnight for  <dig> h at room temperature in  <dig> ul rehydration buffer containing  <dig> m urea,  <dig> m thiourea, 2% w/v chaps,  <dig> mm dtt,  <dig> % ipg buffer and a trace of bromophenol blue. the protein sample  was mixed in  <dig> ul sample buffer containing  <dig> m urea,  <dig> m thiourea, 2% chaps,  <dig> % ipg buffer ph 3- <dig> nl,  <dig> mm destreak reagent  and a trace of bromophenol blue. samples were cup-loaded near the anode of the ipg strips using ettan ipgphor cup-loading  according to the manufacturer's protocol. protein focusing was achieved using the following ief parameters:  <dig> v, step and hold,  <dig> h;  <dig> v, gradient,  <dig> h;  <dig> v, gradient,  <dig> h;  <dig> v, gradient,  <dig>  h;  <dig> v, step and hold for  <dig> h, giving a total of  <dig> vh.

after focusing, the strips were removed immediately and equilibrated by gentle shaking for  <dig> min in  <dig> ml equilibration buffer , followed by  <dig> ml of the same solution containing  <dig> % w/v iodoacetamine instead of dtt for  <dig> min. the second dimension was performed by sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  on a 12% w/v separation gel using the hoefer se  <dig> vertical chambers. first dimension ipg gel strips were cut and placed on top of the second dimension vertical gels  and sealed in place with boiling  <dig> % agarose in running buffer, containing  <dig>  m tris base,  <dig>  m glycine,  <dig> % w/v sds, ph  <dig> . the second dimension separation was performed sequentially with a constant voltage of  <dig> v for  <dig>  h, and  <dig> v for  <dig> h. after sds-page, the separated gels were visualized by silver staining. the similarities of protein spots on scanned images were analyzed using imagemaster 2de platinum software version  <dig>  .

RESULTS
characterization of undifferentiated t3/hdf and t3/cmhdf cells
the hes-t <dig> cells  were cultured on t3hdf feeder in hes medium   and feeder-free matrigel in t3hdf-conditioned medium with additional  <dig> ng/ml bfgf  for  <dig> and  <dig> passages, respectively. the t3/hdf and t3/cmhdf, as well as t3/mef and t3/cmmef, cells were stained positively for oct <dig> and nanog .

expression profiling of mrnas
the genome-wide mrna expression profiles of t3/hdf and t3/cmhdf cells were determined using affymetrix human genome u <dig> plus  <dig>  genechip. the original data have been deposited to ncbi database, and the geo series number is gse <dig>  the average values of duplicate analyses for expressed mrnas from t3/hdf and t3/cmhdf cells were compared by scatter plot . the pearson correlation coefficient of r =  <dig>  between t3/hdf and t3/cmhdf cells indicates their very similar expression profiles of mrnas, and only  <dig> and  <dig> genes were found to be abundantly  differentially  expressed in t3/hdf and t3/cmhdf cells, respectively . it may be noted that galanin and galectin  <dig> were the most abundant and expressed at extremely high levels of  <dig> and  <dig> folds of overall mean in t3/hdf and t3/cmhdf cells, respectively.

the mrna expression profiles of t3/hdf and t3/cmhdf cells were also compared with those  of t3/mef and t3/cmmef cells determined previously  <cit>  in fig.  <dig>  and very high similarities were found among these four populations of hes-t <dig> cells, that is, the values of r =  <dig>  between t3/mef and t3/cmmef, r =  <dig>  between t3/mef and t3/hdf, r =  <dig>  between t3/cmmef and t3/cmhdf cells. it may be noted that hierarchical clustering and principle component analysis  of all genechip results from four hes cell populations indicated the duplicate data were closely related, implying the good quality of their microarray data . the very high expression levels of  <dig> "stemness" genes such as oct <dig>  and nanog, as well as low expression levels of  <dig> differentiation markers of ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm  <cit> , from t3/hdf, t3/cmhdf, t3/mef and t3/cmmef cells  indicate that these four cell populations contained very high proportions of undifferentiated hes cells. the fold-changes of the  <dig> "stemness" genes and  <dig> differentiation markers among these four cell populations  indicate that sall <dig> gene appeared to express much higher level in t3/hdf cells compared with other three cell populations.

signaling pathways and go process networks
the mrnas expressed more than three folds of overall mean from t3/hdf and t3/cmhd, as well as t3/mef and t3/cmmef, cells were analyzed for genego canonical pathway maps and go process networks by using metacore analytical suite, and these four populations of hes cells abundantly expressed  <dig> common genes . t3/hdf and t3/cmhdf cells abundantly expressed  <dig>  common genes, and  <dig> and  <dig> unique genes, respectively, whereas t3/mef and t3/cmmef cells abundantly expressed only  <dig> common genes, and  <dig> and  <dig> unique genes, respectively. it is of interest that the abundantly expressed genes  of t3/hdf and t3/cmhd cells are more than twice of those  of t3/mef and t3/cmmef cells .

the top  <dig> genego canonical pathway maps of t3/hdf, t3/cmhdf, t3/mef and t3/cmmef cells are shown in fig. 2b. the number  <dig> pathway of their  <dig> common genes is involved in development, that is, the role of activin a in cell differentiation and proliferation, and another three of top  <dig> pathways are involved in cell adhesion . it may be further noted that the number  <dig> go process network of their  <dig> common genes is also involved in cell adhesion , and four of top  <dig> go process networks are involved in development  . the first two of the top  <dig> pathways of the  <dig> similar genes among these four cell populations are cell adhesion  and the third pathway is regulation of metabolism . the top three process networks of these  <dig> similar genes are development . as to the differentially altered pathways of unique genes, the top three pathways in t3/hdf cells are cell adhesion , immune response  and signaling transduction . the top three pathways in t3/cmhdf cells are development , cytoskeleton remodeling  and immune response . the top three pathways in t3/mef cells are cell adhesion , cytoskeleton remodeling  and regulation of metabolism . the top two pathways in t3/cmmef cells are cytoskeleton remodeling  and cell adhesion .

expression profiling of mirnas
the expression profiles of  <dig> human mirnas in t3/hdf and t3/cmhdf cells were quantitated using taqman mirna assays as described previously  <cit> , and the expression level of each mirna was indicated as folds over u <dig> snrna. the average values of triplicate analyses and fold-changes for  <dig> mirnas from these two different cell populations are given in additional file 7: table s <dig>  the pearson correlation coefficient of r =  <dig>  between t3/hdf and t3/cmhdf cells indicates their similar mirna expression profiles . the expression levels and fold-changes of  <dig> most abundantly expressed mirnas of t3/hdf and t3/cmhdf, as well as those of  <dig> mirnas of t3/mef and t3/cmmef, cells are summarized in table  <dig>  these results indicate that nine hes cell-specific mirnas  were abundantly expressed in t3/hdf and t3/cmhdf cells, and that mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> had little more than 2-fold variations between these two cell populations. in addition, eleven other mirnas  appeared to express more than 2-folds in t3/cmhdf compared with t3/hdf cells. it may also be noted that the mirna data of t3/mef and t3/cmmef cells were previously determined using the set of  <dig> mirnas in which mir-302a, 302b, 302c and  <dig> were not included, and that very similar expression profiles of mirnas  between t3/mef and t3/cmmef cells were also found previously  <cit> . no mirna with more than 2-fold variation was found between the  <dig> abundantly expressed mirnas of t3/mef and t3/cmmef cells .

protein patterns of 2d-gel analysis
the total soluble proteins extracted from t3/hdf and t3/cmhdf, as well as t3/mef and t3/cmmef, cells were separated on 2d-gels, and the silver staining patterns of protein spots from these four hes cell populations appeared to be very similar . the similarities of protein spot patterns among these four 2d-gels were analyzed using imagemaster , and their results are indicated in table  <dig>  a total of approximately  <dig> spots  were separately detected, and approximately  <dig> spots  were matched among these four cell populations. it may be noted that the ranking orders of similarities among these four comparisons of protein spots were found to be the same to those of correlation coefficients of mrnas  and that the correlation coefficient  between % protein match spots and correlation coefficient  of mrnas  was found to be  <dig>  . in other words, the similarities of protein expression among these four cell populations were consistent with those of mrna expression, although the extents of their protein similarities were smaller than those of mrnas. the comparison of both protein spots and mrna levels between t3/mef and t3/cmmef cells exhibited the most similarity, while that of t3/hdf and t3/mef cells had lowest similarity.

discussion
the hes-t <dig> cell line with normal female karyotype, one of five hes cell lines derived in our laboratory  <cit> , was used to differentiate into autogeneic fibroblast-like cells  as feeder to support the undifferentiated growth of hes-t <dig> cells  for  <dig> passages  <cit>  according to the previously published procedure  <cit> . stojkovic et al.  <cit>  reported that the hes cells cultured on autogeneic feeder and matrigel in the presence of autogeneic conditioned medium for  <dig> and  <dig> passages, respectively, still maintained normal karyotype and expressed hes markers such as tra-1- <dig>  ssea- <dig> and gtcm- <dig>  this autogeneic feeder system was further shown to permit continuous growth of pluripotent hes cells as demonstrated by the formation of teratoma in scid mice and in vitro differentiation. in this investigation, a feeder-free culture on matrigel in medium conditioned by these autogeneic feeder cells  was established to maintain the undifferentiated growth of hes-t <dig> cells  for  <dig> passages. the gene expression profiles of mrnas, mirnas and proteins among the undifferentiated t3/hdf, t3/cmhdf, t3/mef and t3/cmmef cells were shown to be very similar. in recent years, many improvements on standard mef culture have been reported to develop xeno-free culture systems of hes cells for future clinical applications  <cit> . to our knowledge, this investigation is the first report that systematically compared and demonstrated the similar expression profiles of mrnas, mirnas and proteins among different feeders and conditioned media. however, many more passages  of the undifferentiated growth of hes-t <dig> cells on autogeneic t3hdf feeder and feeder-free on matrigel in the t3hdf conditioned medium should be carried out and their differentiation capacities  should also be demonstrated using formation of embryoid bodies in vitro and/or teratoma in scid mice in the future investigation.

the abundantly expressed genes of t3/hdf, t3/cmhd, t3/mef and t3/cmmef cells were found to play prominent roles in signaling pathways and go process networks. three of the top  <dig> genego canonical pathway maps and four of the top  <dig> go process networks of the common and/or similar genes among these four cell populations were involved in development. their number  <dig> pathway was the role of activin a in cell differentiation and proliferation, and the importance of activin/nodal/tgfβ family members in the maintenance of pluripotency of hes cells is widely established  <cit> . among these common and/or similar genes, cell adhesion was also involved in three of the top  <dig> genego canonical pathway maps and two of the top  <dig> go process networks. however, the abundantly differentially expressed genes of t3/hdf and t3/mef cells grown on feeder appeared to play important roles in cell adhesion , while those of t3/cmhdf and t3/cmmef cells grown on feeder-free matrigel in their conditioned medium had important effects on cytoskeleton remodeling. the fact that the many more genes were found to be expressed abundantly in t3/hdf and t3/cmhdf cells compared with t3/mef and t3/cmmef cells may indicate that autogeneic feeder cells and their conditioned medium were better suitable for the undifferentiated growth of hes cells than those of mef. it is also of interest that galanin and galectin  <dig> were the most abundantly expressed genes in t3/hdf and t3/cmhdf cells, respectively. galanin is a neuropeptide with important central nervous system actions   <cit> . the galectin- <dig> protein has been reported to have many diverse biological functions  <cit> . the specific roles of galanin and galectin- <dig> proteins in t3/hdf and t3/cmhdf cells remain to be investigated.

the mirnas, a class of noncoding small rnas that participate in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, have been shown to play key roles in maintenance of the undifferentiated and pluripotent state as well as differentiation and lineage commitment of embryonic stem cells  <cit> . as demonstrated previously  <cit> , the mir-302/ <dig> cluster on chromosome  <dig> and mir-371/372/ <dig> cluster on chromosome  <dig> were extremely abundantly expressed in undifferentiated hes-t <dig> cells grown on t3hdf feeder  and feeder-free matrigel in t3hdf-conditioned medium , as well as mef feeder  and feeder-free matrigel in mef-conditioned medium . the members of these two clusters share a consensus seed sequence and their targeted genes have overlapping functions  <cit> . the extremely abundant expression of hes cell-specific mir-302/ <dig> and mir-371/372/ <dig> clusters also indicated the very high proportion of undifferentiated hes cells present in these four cell populations. recently, we reported that the expression of hes cell-specific mirnas mir- <dig> d, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> and mir-200c, as well as mir-199a, were strongly up-regulated by activin a  <cit> . it should also be noted that the large variations between the mirna expression levels of t3/hdf and t3/cmhdf cells and those of t3/mef and t3/cmmef cells were most likely due to the different platforms  used.

the soluble proteins of t3/hdf, t3/cmhdf, t3/mef and t3/cmmef cells were separated on 2d-gels, and their patterns of protein spots appeared to be very similar. the extents of protein similarities among these four cell populations appeared to be smaller than those of mrnas, and these results may be due to the more variations of proteins because of post-translational modifications and/or technical variations among different 2d-gels. in the future studies, the proteins, which will be extracted using the classic ripa buffer  to obtain more proteins from the cells, from two different cell populations will be first labeled separately with cy <dig> and cy <dig> dyes, and then pooled together for comparison on a single 2d-gel in order to detect more accurately their similarities and differences. the different protein spots among these four cell populations will be identified using tandem mass spectrometry. it will be of interest if these different proteins were found to be in common with their unique genes detected in mrna profiling. although the proteomes of hes cells have previously been reported  <cit> , the quantitative comparison between proteomes of hes-t <dig> cells and their differentiated fibroblasts  is being investigated in our laboratory. our preliminary results  indicate that many of abundantly differentially expressed proteins are found to be heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins . this finding of abundant hnrnp proteins is consistent with the facts that hes cells exhibit high ratio of nucleus to cytoplasm  <cit>  and the hnrnp proteins are among the most abundant proteins in nucleus  <cit> . as to the proteome of t3df cells, the abundantly differentially expressed proteins include several glycolytic enzymes such as l-lactate dehydrogenase a, and this observation is also consistent with the more anaerobic metabolism of fibroblasts.

CONCLUSIONS
the hes-t <dig> cell line was previously used to differentiate into autogeneic fibroblast-like cells  as feeder to support the undifferentiated growth of hes-t <dig> cells . in this investigation, a feeder-free culture on matrigel in hes medium conditioned by these autogeneic feeder cells  was established to maintain the undifferentiated growth of hes-t <dig> cells . the gene expression profiles of mrnas, micrornas and proteins between the undifferentiated t3/hdf and t3/cmhdf cells were shown to be very similar, and their expression profiles were also found to be similar to those of t3/mef and t3/cmmef cells grown on mef feeder and feeder-free matrigel in mef-conditioned medium, respectively. the undifferentiated state of t3/hdf and t3/cmhdf, as well as t3/mef and t3/cmmef, cells was evidenced by the very high expression levels of "stemness" genes, as well as hes cell-specific mir-302/ <dig> and mir-371/372/ <dig> clusters, and low expression levels of differentiation markers of ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm in addition to the strong staining of oct <dig> and nanog. thus, the t3hdf feeder and t3hdf-conditioned medium were able to support the undifferentiated growth of hes cells, and they would be useful for drug development and toxicity testing in addition to the reduced risks of xenogeneic pathogens when used for medical applications such as cell therapies.
