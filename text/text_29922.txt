BACKGROUND
temporal periods of light have provided a significant abiotic selection pressure and greatly influenced evolution on earth. accordingly, diurnal changes in various biological activities have been observed in different organisms, ranging from bacteria to mammals  <cit> . central for the capacity to anticipate such environmental changes is an internal clock that controls circadian gene expression and orchestrates cell physiology in synchrony with a day and night cycle  <cit> .

cyanobacteria are the only prokaryotes with a circadian clock  <cit> . these organisms thrive in environments as diverse as fresh and salt waters, glaciers, deserts, and hot springs, where they play a major role in global carbon sequestration and oxygen production. in addition, some cyanobacteria, such as cyanothece sp. atcc  <dig>  are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen and contribute to a great extent to the marine nitrogen cycle  <cit> . cyanothece  <dig> is a unicellular cyanobacterium that separates oxygenic photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation temporally, thereby circumventing the irreversible inactivation of the oxygen sensitive nitrogenase enzyme  <cit> . in cyanothece  <dig>  photosynthesis occurs during the day and nitrogen fixation during the night of a diurnal cycle  <cit> .

previous work has focused on the identification of different clock components such as kaia, kaib and kaic, and several detailed mathematical models describing the interactions between oscillator components have been published  <cit> . most of these studies are based on modeling transcriptional and translational feedback loops as well as post-transcriptional modifications of clock genes. in other work, global dna microarray analysis of synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  a non-diazotrophic strain, under constant light conditions determined the extent of circadian control at the transcriptional level, leading to the prediction of 2–7% of cyclic genes  <cit> . in contrast, microarray analyses of cyanothece  <dig> under alternating light and dark conditions revealed that ~30% of the genes in the genome are significantly diurnally regulated  <cit> , whereas only 10% of these genes are circadian controlled  <cit> . however, a detailed analytical approach to distinguish between diurnal and circadian regulated genes in cyanothece  <dig> is still outstanding.

organisms such as cyanothece  <dig> perform different cellular processes at distinct phases of the diurnal cycle and thus depend on tightly regulated expression programs. on the other hand, the capability to adjust to periodic changes in their environment, in particular to alterations of light intensity and quantity, provides an important basis for the ecological success of these organisms. light is an essential abiotic factor, not only because cyanobacteria obtain their entire energy through photosynthesis, but also for the activation and regulation of many central metabolic processes. in order to understand how cyanothece  <dig> balances gene expression under nitrogen-fixing conditions in consecutive light and dark cycles with altered physiological requirements under constant light conditions, we analyzed data sets from two different microarray experiments, to elucidate details beyond of what has been found in the former studies  <cit> .

for this study we developed various advanced mathematical tools to identify rhythmic and transient patterns of gene expression. we demonstrate that a combination of different analytical approaches substantially improves the distinction between transient and cyclic gene expression. our analysis revealed that a high percentage of the previously observed strongly diurnally regulated genes  <cit>  are significantly affected under constant light conditions. interestingly, the majority of circadian controlled genes in cyanothece  <dig> are maximally expressed during the subjective dark and largely comprised of genes related to energy metabolism. furthermore, we found a significant number of genes that show ultradian rhythms in their expression and oscillate with a period of  <dig> hours. this study provides a novel and adaptable analytical tool for comparison of data from different microarray experiments to study gene expression in a variety of organisms with diurnal, circadian and ultradian behavior.

RESULTS
microarray data sets
we have analyzed two independent cyanothece  <dig> microarray data sets that were performed over two consecutive diurnal periods with a sampling rate of every four hours and a shift in sampling time of one hour between the experiments. the studies were conducted using agilent  custom-made two-channel microarrays. the work of stöckel et al.  <cit>  focused on global gene expression in cyanothece atcc  <dig> under alternating  <dig> hour light and dark cycles, while toepel et al.  <cit>  investigated changes in gene expression under a  <dig> hour light and  <dig> hour dark period followed by a constant light period of  <dig> hours. in both experiments cyanothece  <dig> cells were grown under nitrogen-fixing conditions.

data analyses and identification of cyclic expressed genes
in stöckel et al.  <cit>  diurnal regulated genes were classified using a correlation network and a fold-change cutoff of  <dig> , in which genes with a period other than  <dig> hours were excluded, since they did not correlate with the main oscillatory network. in toepel et al.  <cit>  cyclic genes were identified using a 2-fold cutoff for maximal changes in gene expression. although the main oscillatory behaviors are detectable using these methods, alterations in gene expression such as changes of amplitudes and phase-shifts were not observed, especially because the altered light conditions were applied only for a short period of time. therefore we proposed a combination of an angular distance based criteria to characterize such alterations in gene expression.

after normalization of both raw data sets, the main frequency components of gene expression were identified using fast fourier transform  according to  <cit> . for the data from stöckel et al.  <cit> , the majority of genes under alternating light and dark cycles oscillate with a period of approximately  <dig> hours . interestingly, a considerable number of genes show a principal frequency close to two cycles per day, which corresponds to genes that oscillate with a period of  <dig> hours. in comparison, similar analyses of data from toepel et al.  <cit>  show that the frequencies are distributed over a wider range, with a larger number of genes cycling with  <dig> and  <dig> hour periods . the extended periods of 40– <dig> hours  are mainly assigned to genes that do not continue to oscillate under continuous light conditions. thus, the differences between the two histograms primarily reflect the impact of continuous light on gene expression in cyanothece  <dig> 

the two main frequencies of  <dig> and  <dig> hours were used for further fourier score calculations. for the determination of cyclic behavior, a fourier score cutoff of  <dig>  corresponding to a false discovery rate of 2% under alternating light and dark conditions and of 3% under continuous light was used. based on this analysis,  <dig> genes that oscillate with a period of  <dig> hours and  <dig> genes that cycle with a period of  <dig> hours were identified as common in both microarray datasets. an additional  <dig> genes that oscillate with a period of  <dig> hours and  <dig> with a period of  <dig> hours were detected only in the stöckel et.al data set. all of these genes were used for further analyses .

classification of light responsive genes
since the fourier score-based method is primarily designed for the identification of cyclic gene expression, and because genes with altered expression patterns are detectible only in time points corresponding to the subjective dark, an angular distance based method was proposed to identify transient behaviors in gene expression. accordingly, the data were separated into four  <dig> hour subsets, which correspond to the individual light and dark periods and thus resulted in four 3-dimensional vectors. if a gene shows a cyclic expression, smaller distances between vectors related either to two light or two dark periods are expected. in contrast, larger distances are anticipated for vectors from different periods such as light and dark. for genes showing transient behavior in their expression, the vector equivalent to the subjective dark is likely to be different from the dark . figure 2a shows the distribution of vectors for the gene cce_ <dig>  which encodes hoxf, one of the subunits of the bidirectional hydrogenase, as an example of circadian gene expression. all vectors corresponding to individual light and dark periods are well separated and the vector representing the subjective dark is closely associated with the vectors derived from other dark periods. in contrast, the gene cce_ <dig>  encoding the small subunit hups of the uptake hydrogenase, does not continue to oscillate under constant light conditions . the altered expression of cce_ <dig> is clearly indicated in that the vector related to the subjective dark period shows a different orientation.

the similarity threshold chosen for the angular distance method ought to yield a dataset of cycling genes in utmost agreement between the fourier score based and angular distance methods. therefore, for the angular distance method the number of cyclic genes among the set of already identified cycling genes was calculated for different threshold values . based on these calculations, a cutoff of  <dig>  for the angular distance was selected, which resulted in 97% and 78% fourier score based agreement for the stöckel et al.  <cit>  and toepel et al.  <cit>  data sets, respectively. the expression of a gene in two different  <dig> hour periods was considered to be similar if the corresponding vectors were within a distance of  <dig>  to each other, and disparate if the distance was higher. the vectors of genes transcribed with an ultradian period of  <dig> hours revealed consistently smaller angular distances for any two regions .

based on the fourier score and angular distance based methods, four major groups of genes could be identified. the genes in group  <dig> continued to oscillate under continuous light and were classified as circadian controlled genes, whereas genes from group  <dig> were light responsive and showed oscillating expression only under alternating light and dark cycles. both groups represent genes that cycle with a  <dig> hour period. in contrast, genes from group  <dig> and  <dig> oscillate with an ultradian period of about  <dig> hours, with genes from group  <dig> being circadian controlled and the genes from group  <dig> light responsive .

after the application of both criteria, our analysis of the stöckel et al. dataset  <cit>  identified 43% of genes in the cyanothece  <dig> genome  with oscillating expression patterns under alternating light and dark conditions, in comparison to the previously reported  <dig> genes. this suggests that diurnal regulation of gene expression in cyanothece  <dig> might be greater than previously thought. however, after combining and analyzing both data sets using the two different methods, only  <dig>  of genes in the genome were found to be diurnally regulated or light inducible, and  <dig> genes  could be classified as circadian controlled. this relatively small number of diurnally regulated genes common in both data sets results from the stringent criteria that were used for the gene classification to correct for differences in growth and culture conditions and therefore comprises the more significant cyclic expressed genes. interestingly, five circadian controlled genes and  <dig> genes with transient expression patterns oscillate with an ultradian frequency of  <dig> hours . as an example, figure  <dig> shows the expression pattern for the genes cce_ <dig> and cce_ <dig> that oscillate with a  <dig> hour period.

taken together, the combination of the angular distance and fourier score based methods lent an additional level of confidence to the identification of cyclic expressed genes in cyanothece  <dig>  these analyses uncovered that most of the previously identified diurnal genes are indeed light responsive.

diurnal regulated genes belonging to different functional categories
considering the central role of photosynthesis in the cellular metabolism of cyanothece  <dig> and other cyanobacteria, a great impact of light on gene expression was anticipated. we found that the expression of the majority of regulatory genes is light responsive, presumably the result of comprehensive changes that take place in order to adjust to altered light conditions . in addition, the expression of many genes related to transcription and translation is light regulated and likely accounts for a higher turnover of proteins under continuous light. our analyses also revealed that several genes associated with photosynthesis, especially with photosystem ii  such as psbe, psbf, and psbj are circadian controlled . the psbj protein in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> has been shown to control the amount of functionally assembled psii complexes in the thylakoid membrane  <cit> . moreover, psbe and psbf which encode the α and β subunits of cytochrome b <dig> are required to stabilize the reaction center of psii  <cit> . interestingly, a number of subunits of the atp-synthase complex, including atpf and atph, which are encoded by multicopy genes revealed that one gene copy is light responsive while the other gene copy was found to be circadian controlled . the gene atph has been identified as clock controlled in previous studies of synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  <cit> .

a more detailed analysis of different metabolic processes revealed that nitrate and sulfate assimilation are largely under circadian control . furthermore, the genes hoxefuyh encoding the bidirectional hydrogenase show a significant cyclic behavior in their expression .

in fact, several light responsive and circadian controlled genes are found in clusters of three or more genes throughout the cyanothece  <dig> genome . such clustering of similarly regulated genes into different regions of the genome might provide an opportunity for the cell to control the gene expression more efficiently. on the other hand, additional diurnal and circadian controlled genes can be identified which might not have been detected due to low amplitudes of oscillations. thus, there is a high probability that an unclassified gene within a group of genes assigned to one of the two categories belongs to the same class.

furthermore, we found that the majority of circadian controlled genes are maximally expressed at the beginning of the dark period and are largely comprised of genes related to energy metabolism . in contrast, most of the light responsive genes peak during the middle of the dark or light periods , which suggests that their expression is regulated by the presence or absence of light rather than in anticipation of the different light cycles. in addition, fft, fourier score, and angular distance calculations revealed  <dig> genes that show ultradian rhythms in their expression and oscillate with a period of  <dig> hours. ultradian rhythms of cell division have been observed in several organisms including cyanobacteria  <cit> , even though the major timing system for all light-sensitive organisms is a circadian clock that operates with a period of approximately  <dig> hours. therefore, the finding of  <dig> hour cycles in the expression of genes related to other cellular processes was unanticipated and is novel among cyanobacteria. previous studies in the anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria rhodobacter sphaeroides and rhodospirillum rubrum uncovered a rhythmicity of gene expression and enzyme activities with a period length of either  <dig> or  <dig> hours depending on the growth conditions  <cit> . studies in eukaryotic unicellular microbes such as yeast have shown that an ultradian oscillator regulates cyclic respiratory activity and global gene expression  <cit> . this is particularly interesting since cydb, which encodes a subunit of one of the terminal oxidases in cyanothece  <dig>  shows an ultradian expression in both microarrays datasets, whereas the expression of the majority of respiratory genes is considerably affected under subjective dark conditions  <cit> . however, further studies are required to elucidate the role and physiological significance of such ultradian rhythms in cyanothece  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in this work we compared two independent microarray experiments to study changes in gene expression under alternating and constant light conditions in cyanothece  <dig>  two mathematical approaches were applied to differentiate transient behaviors from cyclic gene expression. fourier score based methods can successfully be used for identification of cyclic behaviors but they fail to detect some transient behaviors such as shifts of the expression peaks or smaller amplitudes under constant light conditions. therefore, an angular distance based method was applied which improved the detection of such changes. these methods are valid for distinguishing transient from cyclic behaviors even for the limited number of time points in one of the different light treatments. this approach provides an adaptable tool for future studies of diurnal, circadian and ultradian rhythms in various organisms. furthermore, the combined analysis of two different microarray data sets enabled the extraction of novel details about diurnal and circadian regulation in cyanothece  <dig> which would not be obtained from the individual experiments alone.
