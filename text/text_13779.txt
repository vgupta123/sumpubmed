BACKGROUND
magnesium is the second most abundant cation within the cell and plays an important role in many intracellular biochemical functions  <cit> . despite the abundance and importance of magnesium, little is known about how eukaryotic cells regulate their magnesium content.

intracellular free mg2+ concentration is in the order of  <dig>  mm which is 1–2% of the total cellular magnesium  <cit> . accordingly, intracellular mg2+ is maintained below the concentration predicted from the transmembrane electrochemical potential. intracellular mg2+ concentration is finely regulated likely by precise controls of mg2+ entry, mg2+ efflux, and intracellular storage compartments  <cit> . the transporters comprising these pathways have only begun to be identified.

few magnesium transporters have been identified at the molecular level. schweyen and colleagues have demonstrated that the mitochondrial rna splicing <dig>  gene encodes a protein that is present in yeast and mammalian inner mitochondrial membranes  <cit> . mrs <dig> mediates high capacity mg2+ influx in isolated yeast mitochondria driven by the inner membrane potential but also transports a range of divalent cations such as ni2+, co2+, and cu2+  <cit> . overexpression of mrs <dig> increases influx while deletion of the gene abolishes uptake suggesting that it is the major mitochondrial system. this data suggests that mrs <dig> protein may mediate mg2+ transport in mammalian mitochondria. nadler et al first identified trpm <dig>  a widely expressed member of the transient receptor potential melastatin  ion channel family, that produces a mg2+ current in a wide variety of cells  <cit> . trpm <dig> is regulated by intracellular mg·atp levels and is similarly permeable to both major divalent cations, ca2+ and mg2+, but also many of the trace elements, such as zn2+, mn2+, and co2+  <cit> . using a positional cloning approach, schlingmann et al  <cit>  and walder et al  <cit>  found that hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia  was caused by mutations in trpm <dig>  a new member of the trpm family. hsh is an inherited disease affecting both intestinal and renal mg2+ absorption  <cit> . the functional characteristics of the trpm <dig> transporter have not been fully elucidated  <cit> . other magnesium transporters have been functionally described but they have not been characterized at the molecular level  <cit> . it is disparaging that, despite the significance of cellular mg2+, only three specific magnesium transporters have been described in mammalian cells to date.

mammalian magnesium homeostasis is a balance of epithelial intestinal magnesium absorption and renal magnesium excretion. the kidney plays a major role in control of vertebrate magnesium balance, in part, by active magnesium transport within the distal tubule of the nephron  <cit> . using the madin-darby canine kidney  cell line obtained from canine distal tubules and immortalized mouse distal convoluted tubule cells , we have shown that mg2+ entry is through specific and regulated magnesium pathways that are controlled by a variety of hormonal influences  <cit> . however these hormones do not provide selective control as they also affect calcium and in some cases sodium and potassium transport  <cit> . selective and sensitive control of cellular mg2+ transport is regulated by intrinsic mechanisms so that culture in media containing low magnesium results in upregulation of mg2+ uptake in these cells. this adaptive increase in mg2+ entry was shown to be dependent on de novo transcription since prior treatment of the epithelial cells with actinomycin d prevented the adaptation to low extracellular magnesium  <cit> . the data suggest that epithelial cells can somehow sense the environmental magnesium and through transcription- and translation-dependent processes alter mg2+ transport and maintain magnesium balance. these conclusions using isolated epithelial cells are consonant with our views of magnesium conservation in the intact kidney  <cit> .

in an attempt to identify genes underlying cellular changes resulting from adaptation to low extracellular magnesium, we used oligonucleotide microarray analysis to screen for magnesium-regulated transcripts in epithelial cells. this approach revealed one transcript whose relative level was dramatically altered by extracellular magnesium. thus, this transcript potentially represented a species of mrna whose synthesis was regulated by changes in cell magnesium. in this study, we describe the identification and characterization of this novel transcript referred to as magt <dig>  our data indicate magt <dig> may mediate mg2+ transport in a wide variety of cells and may play a role in control of cellular magnesium homeostasis.

RESULTS
identification of magt1
with the knowledge that differential gene expression is involved with selective control of epithelial cell magnesium conservation, our strategy was to use microarray analysis to identify candidates that were up-regulated with low magnesium. using affymetrix genechipr technology, we showed that  <dig> dna fragments were significantly increased  from the  <dig>  mouse ests represented on the chips. the rna of one of these was significantly increased, greater than 2-fold, n =  <dig>  determined by real-time rt-pcr. the full length human cdna was identified from clone dkfzp564k142q <dig> obtained from rzpd resource center, berlin, in pamp <dig> vector and bidirectionally sequenced at naps, university of british columbia. based on the cdna sequence, electrophysiological properties and cation selectivity of the encoded protein, we designated it as magt <dig> for magnesium transport protein, subtype  <dig>  mgt was not used to avoid confusion with the bacterial mgta/b and mgte magnesium transporters  <cit> .

primary structure of magt1
magt <dig> cdna comprises 2241-base pairs  with an open reading frame of  <dig> bp that predicts a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a relative molecular mass of  <dig>  da . hydropathy profile analysis suggested that magt <dig> is an integral membrane protein containing five hydrophobic transmembrane-spanning  α helical regions, the first of which is likely cleaved to form the final product with four tm domains . magt <dig> contains a n-linked glycosylation site at residue  <dig> located in the first extracellular loop. the n-terminal region of magt <dig> contains four putative camp-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites at residues s <dig>  s <dig>  t <dig> and s <dig> and four possible protein kinase c phosphorylation sites at residues s <dig>  t <dig>  s <dig>  t <dig>  the short c-terminal cytoplasmic region does not possess any camp-dependent or protein kinase c phosphorylation sites. the presence of putative phosphorylation sites for protein kinase a and protein kinase c in the cytoplasmic domain suggests that transport might be regulated by phosphorylation.

magt <dig> is a novel gene located at xq <dig> – <dig> 
the human origin, chromosomal location, and intron-exon organization of the magt <dig> gene were deduced from the expressed sequence tag  database and the human genome data. there may be an alternative splicing of magt <dig> but only one transcript could be seen on the northern blot . mouse mmagt <dig> gene is comprised of  <dig> exons spanning  <dig>  bp located on the x chromosome . the human hmagt <dig> gene is composed of  <dig> exons spanning  <dig>  bp and is also on the x chromosome .

a blast search yielded a number of poorly characterized proteins with similar amino acid sequences to magt <dig> . using the bestfit sequence alignment program, magt <dig> shows 100% identity to a human unnamed protein , 88% to a mouse implantation associated protein , 87% to a rat implantation associated protein , 66%  to a human implantation associated protein  and to an unknown protein mgc: <dig> from the zebra fish . magt <dig> shares some similarity  to the human , mouse , and rat  putative prostate cancer tumor suppressor protein. there is also some similarity  to a number of un-characterized proteins in anopheles , drosophila melanogaster , ochlerotatus trisertiatus , and caenorhabditis elegans . none of these proteins, with similar amino acid sequences to magt <dig>  are sufficiently characterized to suggest a common functional purpose. magt <dig> has a more distant relationship  to the ost <dig> gene of saccharomyces cervisiae that encodes a regulatory subunit of the endoplasmic reticulum oligosaccharyltransferase complex  <cit> . a gapped alignment of these sequences showed only 21% identical residues between the hmagt <dig> and ost <dig> sequences extending throughout most of both proteins.

tissue distribution of magt <dig> expression
northern analysis of cultured mouse distal convoluted tubule cells and tissues harvested from mice revealed a single strong transcript of about  <dig>  kb . the kidney, colon, heart and liver possessed relatively high levels of magt <dig> mrna and smaller amounts were found in intestine, spleen, brain, and lung . accordingly, magt <dig> mrna appears to be widely expressed among tissues but the transcript is variably expressed among these tissues.

the magt <dig> antibody recognized two protein bands,  <dig> and  <dig> kda, in tissues expressing the magt <dig> transcript . two bands were apparent in kidney and liver tissue whereas one was evident in heart, colon, and brain. the molecular size of magt <dig> calculated from cdna is  <dig> kda. a significant difference in the calculated molecular size and that the smaller band found by immunoblot analysis raises the possibility that magt <dig> may be cleaved to yield the  <dig> kda carboxyl-terminal protein detected by magt <dig> antibody. there was very little magt <dig> protein in the small intestine . other than liver tissue, there appears to be a good correlation between the respective amounts of transcripts and the protein content. the discrepancy between the levels of magt <dig> mrna and protein expression in liver  suggests that a posttranslational mechanism may play a role in tissue-specific expression of the magt <dig> protein. in summary, the  <dig> kda magt <dig> protein is expressed to a variable extent in all of the tissues sampled  but the  <dig> kda band appears to be present in only some of the tissues. although this is a limited survey of tissues, the results suggest that magt <dig> is expressed in many tissues with an apparent correlation of mrna and protein but expression may be post-translationally modified in a tissue-specific fashion such as the liver.

the specificity of the affinity-purified polyclonal anti-magt <dig> antibody was assessed by western blots of the total protein extract from the mdct cells probed with a preimmune serum. no protein of the predicted size  was detected when the preimmune serum was used . taken together, the results indicate that the affinity-purified anti-magt <dig> antibody specifically reacts with the endogenous magt <dig> protein.

human magt <dig> elicits mg2+-evoked currents in xenopus oocytes
the functional properties of magt1-evoked mg2+ currents were characterized using two-microelectrode voltage clamp analysis in xenopus oocytes injected with hmagt <dig> crna. the electrophysiological data gave evidence for a rheogenic process with inward currents in hmagt <dig> crna-injected oocytes whereas there were no appreciable currents in control h2o- or total poly+rna-injected cells from the same batch of oocytes . human magt1-mediated mg2+-evoked uptake was linear for at least  <dig> min and did not display any time-dependent decay during repetitive stimulation with voltage steps . the reversal potential was significantly shifted to the right as would be expected of a magnesium transporter . in consonant with the notion that magt <dig> protein mediates the observed mg2+ currents is the association of the magnitude of the mg2+-evoked current with the quantity of magt <dig> protein in oocytes injected with magt <dig> crna . in this study oocytes were selected according to the size of the mg2+-evoked current and western blotting performed on the same oocyte. both  <dig> and  <dig> kda molecular size bands were correlated with the measured currents. steady-state mg2+-evoked currents were saturable . the michaelis constant  was  <dig>  mm, n =  <dig>  when measured at - <dig> mv holding potential . the michaelis constant was independent of the vm used to determine the saturation kinetics. the michaelis constants  were + <dig> mv,  <dig>  mm; - <dig> mv,  <dig>  mm; - <dig>   <dig>  mm; - <dig> mv,  <dig>  mm; - <dig> mv,  <dig> ; - <dig> mv,  <dig>  mm .

the mg2+-evoked currents were not altered with deletion of external sodium by substitution with choline  or replacement of chloride with nitrate  suggesting that transport does not depend on extracellular na+ or cl- . niflumic acid , a cl- channel antagonist, did not affect mg2+ currents . next, we determined the effect of transmembrane h+ gradients on mg2+-evoked currents in magt1-injected oocytes . currents are maximal at physiological ph,  <dig> , and diminished with acidic and alkaline ph values . moreover, amiloride , a na+/k+ exchange inhibitor, did not influence expressed mg2+ currents in oocytes . this data suggests that mg2+-evoked currents are not coupled to h+ movement but are sensitive to external ph. on balance, these data indicate that mg2+-evoked currents in magt1-injected oocytes are not coupled to na+, cl-, or h+ but are influenced by external ph values.

large concentrations  of ca2+, or its analogs, sr2+ and ba2+ or the other divalent cations tested, fe2+, cu2+, co2+, zn2+, mn2+, and ni2+, did not produce appreciable currents in the absence of mg2+ in hmagt1-expressing oocytes . in the experiments shown, the permeability ratios  were corrected for changes in membrane resistance caused by the respective divalent cation using values from h2o-injected oocytes .

some divalent cations inhibited mg2+-evoked currents at relatively large concentrations of the respective inhibitor,  <dig>  mm, in the presence of  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig> . the cations ni2+and zn2+ markedly shifted the Δerev to the left whereas mn2+was less effective and gd3+, cd2+, co2+ and cu2+ were modest inhibitors . the multivalent cation, gd3+, is a nonselective channel blocker that inhibits most ca2+-permeable channels and known trp channels  <cit> . the presence of  <dig>  mm  or  <dig>  mm ca2+,  <dig> ±  <dig> % , was without effect on the amplitude of mg2+-evoked currents. fe2+ had no influence on magt1-mediated currents . on balance, these data indicate that hmagt <dig> crna-induced transport in oocytes is highly selective for mg2+. other divalent cations may be blockers but our evidence is that they are at most very weak agonists.

we have shown that relatively high concentrations of  <dig> -dihydropyridine analogues, organic blockers of l-type ca2+ channels, inhibit mg2+ entry into distal tubule epithelial cells  <cit> . in the present experiments, nifedipine  did not inhibit mg2+-evoked currents  but its analogue nitrendipine  was an effective inhibitor  in magt <dig> expressed oocytes . control mg2+-induced currents were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μa, n =  <dig>  in this series of experiments . these findings were similar to our experience with mdck and mdct epithelial cells  <cit> . again in consonant with our previous studies, the channel agonist, bay k <dig>  stimulated mg2+-evoked currents in expressing oocytes  supporting the above electrophysiological data that magt <dig> is a channel-like protein .

magt <dig> expression is responsive to magnesium
the rationale for these studies is based on the observation that renal magnesium conservation is principally regulated by differential expression of genes encoding magnesium transport proteins. accordingly, we determined the response of magt <dig> to changes in magnesium at the messenger and protein levels. these studies were performed with distal tubule epithelial cells, mdct, cultured in media containing normal  or low  magnesium concentrations for  <dig> h and on kidney cortex tissue harvested from mice maintained on either normal or magnesium-restricted diets for  <dig> days. the mrna and protein expression was relatively stronger in cells cultured in low magnesium media and in tissue of mice maintained on low magnesium diets  compared to normal cells and tissue of animals on normal diets . mdct and tissue mmagt <dig> mrna, as measured by real-time rt-pcr was increased by  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold, respectively . in association with the increases in mrna, magt <dig> protein was increased by  <dig> ± 12% in the cultured epithelial cells and  <dig> ±  <dig> % in kidney cortex with low magnesium relative to the respective controls . accordingly, it is apparent that an increase in mrna levels is translated into higher protein expression and by inference leads to greater magnesium transport .

discussion
despite the extensive evidence for unique mammalian mg2+ transporters, few proteins have been biochemically identified to date that fulfill this role. moreover, functional characterization has not been fully investigated for those that have been reported  <cit> . with the knowledge that the kidney, particularly the distal tubule, regulates magnesium conservation through transcriptional mechanisms, we used oligonucleotide microarray analysis to identify magt <dig>  a novel mg2+ transporter  <cit> . the magt <dig> transcript is a  <dig> -kb mrna that encodes a protein comprising a relatively long n-terminal segment, a putative region of four tm domains, and a short c-terminal sequence. the cytoplasmic segments possess a number of characteristic phosphorylation motifs. magt <dig> shows no structural similarity to any known transporter. functional expression of magt <dig> in oocytes results in large mg2+-evoked currents with little permeability to other divalent cations. however, some divalent cations, ni2+, zn2+, and mn2+inhibit mg2+-evoked currents at relatively large external concentrations. these cations are not found in the extracellular or intracellular fluid at the concentrations used here,  <dig>  mm. the other major extracellular divalent cation, ca2+, was neither transported nor were mg2+-evoked currents inhibited by extracellular ca2+. magt <dig> is widely distributed among tissues particularly those of epithelial structure. finally, magt <dig> expression is regulated in these tissues by external magnesium as predicted by our starting premise. accordingly, magt <dig> fulfills the role of a dedicated mammalian magnesium transporter. the function of magt <dig> in cellular mg2+ balance remains to be determined.

the electrophysiological characteristics of magt <dig> expressed in xenopus oocytes are reminiscent of our observations of mg2+ transport in intact renal epithelial cells measured by microfluorescence  <cit> . there is not a suitable isotope of mg2+ for use in physiological experiments so that we have used fura-mag- <dig> fluorescence to investigate mg2+ transport  <cit> . we have shown that mg2+ uptake in a variety of epithelial cells is driven by the electrochemical gradient of mg2+. membrane hyperpolarization stimulates mg2+ transport whereas depolarization abrogates uptake . there was no evidence in renal distal tubule cells for coupling of apical mg2+ entry to other ions such as na+, cl-, or h+  <cit> . magnesium transport in immortalized mouse distal convoluted tubule  cells is dependent on the transmembrane concentration gradient and uptake is saturable, as determined by fluorescence. the apparent affinity constant is in the order of  <dig>  mm that is similar to that observed for magt <dig> expressed in xenopus oocytes . this affinity is appropriate for a physiological role of the transporter in cellular mg2+ conservation  <cit> . mg2+-evoked currents in oocytes expressing magt <dig> is highly specific for mg2+, an observation that is again consonant with our views of mg2+ transport in mdct cells and in vivo kidney  <cit> . the microfluorescence experiments suggest that there may be some variability in cationic inhibition of mg2+ uptake depending on the cell-type used so that other transporters may be present with differing selectivity that are tissue specific  <cit> . relatively large concentrations of nitrendipine, a  <dig> -dihydropyridine channel blocker, inhibited mg2+-evoked currents in magt1-expressing oocytes not unlike the inhibition of mg2+ entry into distal epithelial cells  <cit> . intriguingly, nifedipine did not influence mg2+-induced currents in magt1-expressing oocytes that is similar to our previous reports using mdct cells  <cit> . although both antagonists are dihydropyridines, they have differing efficacy based on their structural differences  <cit> . again, reminiscent of our observations using mdck and mdct epithelial cells, the channel agonist, bay  <dig>  increased mg2+-evoked currents  <cit> . the  <dig> -dihydropyridines analogues are not highly selective channel blockers/activators but these findings support the notion that mg2+ entry into magt1-expressed oocytes or distal epithelial cells is via channel-like proteins. two other characteristics are noteworthy. first, mg2+-evoked currents in magt1-expressed oocytes are greater at physiological ph values relative to acidic ph. this is also true for mg2+ uptake in distal tubule epithelial cells and magnesium conservation by the intact kidney in vivo  <cit> . magnesium reabsorption is greater and urinary excretion is less in metabolic alkalosis than acidosis. indeed, magnesium wasting may be sufficient in chronic metabolic acidosis to lead to hypomagnesemia  <cit> . second, the presence of multiple putative protein kinase a and c phosphorylation sites in magt <dig> may suggest phosphorylation-dependent regulation. we have shown that mg2+ entry into epithelial cells is stimulated by peptide hormones, such as parathyroid hormone, glucagon and calcitonin, that act through protein kinases a and c  <cit> . further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these phenomena. on balance, many of the functional characteristics of magt <dig> expressed in oocytes are harmonious with our earlier physiological observations using kidney distal convoluted tubule cells.

magt <dig> is a membrane protein that may comprise er, early and late endosomes or apical and basolateral plasma membrane fractions. the role of each of these structures in cellular magnesium homeostasis is poorly understood. using single cell spatial imaging, we have previously shown that intracellular ionized mg2+ concentration is heterogenously distributed across the cell  <cit> . the er or sarcoplasmic reticulum normally contains high concentrations of mg2+, ranging from  <dig> – <dig>  mm, relative to the cytosolic concentration,  <dig>  mm, and nucleus,  <dig>  mm. it is clear that mg2+ is transported into and out of a variety of intracellular compartments and there is likely dedicated magnesium transporters for each event. further studies are required to establish the subcellular localization and intracellular trafficking of mg2+ and the role of magt <dig> protein.

our evidence is that the expression of magt <dig> mrna and protein is responsive to cellular magnesium. the ability of epithelial cells to selectively respond to the availability of essential nutrients, such as zn2+ and fe2+, is not unique but the cellular mechanisms are unknown  <cit> . presumably epithelial cells may sensitively sense intracellular nutrient concentration and through transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms adjust transport rates appropriately  <cit> . our studies indicate that this response within the cell is the basis for sensitive and selective control of magnesium balance in the kidney  <cit> .

epithelial cells comprising the intestine and kidney are primarily involved with dietary magnesium absorption, urinary magnesium excretion, and total body magnesium homeostasis  <cit> . accordingly, magt <dig> may, in part, be responsible for intestinal and renal tubular mg2+ conservation. in support of this is the observation that the magt <dig> transcript is present in these tissues . however, magnesium is necessary in all cells and the wide-spread distribution of the magt <dig> transcript may suggest a housekeeping role for this transporter. it is also germane to note that magt <dig> mrna is regulated in all cells investigated. further studies are needed to define the function of magt <dig> in intestine and kidney and the role in overall cellular magnesium balance.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified a novel magnesium transporter, probably a channel, that is regulated by extracellular magnesium. to our knowledge this is the first report of a highly selective mg2+ transporter. its role in cellular magnesium homeostasis and transepithelial magnesium absorption is unknown but our evidence from our differential gene expression studies indicate that it plays an important in cellular magnesium homeostasis.
