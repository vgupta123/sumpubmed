BACKGROUND
one of the most prevalent patterns observed in natural systems is the overrepresentation of small-bodied taxa  <cit> . the observation of right skew in body size distributions, following transformation to the log scale, has been made for a variety of vertebrate clades  and provides the basis for a variety of size-selective diversification mechanisms that have been previously proposed as general models for the macroevolution of animals . despite widespread interest in these patterns, comparatively little effort has been spent in examining whether such relationships are truly universal and there is limited evidence for their presence across major non-vertebrate lineages . in this study, we explore the relationship between species richness and body size, and the universality of size biased diversification, in one of the largest terrestrial invertebrate clades, the six-legged arthropods or hexapoda.

interest in body size distributions relates to the importance of size in impacting on an organism’s ecology and thus potential evolution and diversification. body size determines the scale of an organism’s interactions within the fractal structure of natural environments  <cit> , the relative strength of gravitational  vs. viscous and inertial forces  <cit>  and, via surface area to volume ratios and the scaling of exchange networks, controls the rates of metabolic processes such as temperature response  <cit>  and gas diffusion  <cit> . as a consequence, body size impacts on almost every major life history trait including: growth, parental investment, range size, dispersal and degree of host specificity .

based on these observations a number of size-dependent mechanisms linked to clade diversification have been proposed . these include; hard limits on minimum size, which restrict random character change  <cit> , energetic models emphasizing the relative efficiency of small body sizes in the production of offspring  <cit> , and fractal environmental models, exploring the capacity for small-bodied taxa to more finely subdivide a given environmental landscape  <cit> . the relationship of these processes to macro-evolutionary diversification remains incompletely understood including, for example, the relative contributions of size-biased cladogenesis   <cit> , directional bias in size evolution within lineages; e.g. “copes rule”  <cit> , and size-biased extinction  <cit> , on the generation of observed size distributions. testing the predictions of these models, e.g. the presence of a relationship between clade richness and body size, as well as more generally exploring the processes that may underlie size evolution, requires that we extend our perspectives to encompass other major lineages that may show differences from our vertebrate model systems  <cit> .

the extreme species richness of hexapod clades, which collectively account for over half of all described species, is one of the most well-known features of terrestrial biomes  <cit> . hexapoda are also morphologically diverse, including body lengths ranging over four orders of magnitude, comparable with the range of well-studied mammal and bird radiations  <cit> . the longest known hexapods are females of the phasmid  phobaeticus chani with specimens up to 357 mm long in body length. by contrast, the smallest recognized adult insect, the male of the mymarid wasp dicopomorpha echmepterygis has a total body length of merely 139 μm   <cit>  . evidence to suggest that processes in hexapod size evolution may be distinct from larger vertebrate groups includes taxonomic compilations , regional faunal data  and broad-scale continental surveys  <cit> , all of which suggest that compared with vertebrates hexapods exhibit relatively little right skew in the distribution of log body size  <cit> . likewise, where formal phylogenetic tests of association between clade richness and body size have been conducted for hexapod sub-clades, they have generally failed to recover evidence for small size promoting richness within the group , with one study even identifying the opposite pattern with respect to anisoptera   <cit> .

in addition to these apparent divergences from size-structured models there are also potential interactions between size evolution and other hexapod traits, several of which have been previously explored as correlates of species richness including complete metamorphosis, and dietary substrate  <cit> . metamorphosis has the potential to structure size evolution via the promotion of modularization of life history stages, and the separation of selection pressures on larval and adult stages  <cit> . this process is taken to extremes in holometabola, where during metamorphosis there is a fundamental reorganization of the body plan  <cit> , and as a result various authors have suggested divergent processes of size evolution associated with this clade .

the recent and growing consensus with regard to hexapod higher taxonomic relationships from molecular markers e.g.  <cit>  provides us, for the first time, with a framework for exploring large scale patterns of trait evolution within the group. in this study, we combine a published phylogeny of insect higher taxa  <cit>  with comprehensive descriptive information regarding size variation within the clade to explore patterns of body size evolution and its relationship with clade diversification. hypotheses we test include: a) if the apparent lack of skew in body size distributions  identified for regional faunas can be identified in a global phylogenetic perspective on hexapod body size, b) if consistent relationships between clade richness and body size occur after accounting for phylogeny and size variation within terminal groups. in addition, we explore the probable evolutionary process that may underpin size evolution in hexapods, and whether different major clades  are associated with divergent evolutionary processes, as has previously demonstrated in mammals  <cit> , with an aim to explore the possible roles of key innovations such as complete metamorphosis  <cit> .

RESULTS
frequency distribution of body sizes
body length range data were gathered for  <dig> higher taxa of insects . the frequency distributions of the observed values of mean-of-logs , log maximum and log minimum body length for terminal taxa are shown in fig.  <dig>  in all three cases the overall distributions are approximately normal , although the distribution of minimum sizes shows a small secondary peak associated with an over-prevalence of taxa reported as bounded at 1 mm . when mean values are weighted according to their species richness, the resulting distribution shows a significant skew towards larger body sizes  running contrary to the expectations of the paradigm described above.fig.  <dig> histograms of raw body length data and estimated mean-of-logs lengths . histograms of a minimum log body size , skewness =  <dig> ) b maximum log body size , skewness =  <dig> ) c calculated mean log body size; for terminal groups used in this analysis , skewness =  <dig> ), d mean size with each terminal group represented proportionally to its richness , skewness = - <dig> ). curves on upper panels reflect normal distributions with the same mean and standard deviation as the observed data. colors in lower panels show breakdown of size classes by major taxonomic group; red - holometabola, green - paraneoptera, magenta - polyneoptera, cyan - palaeoptera, black - basal insects, grey - entognatha



comparing major clades we can identify pronounced differences in typical size distributions observed among groups. as holometabola, the most diverse clade   <cit>  account for the majority of the terminals included in this study , it is unsurprising that the size distribution of holometabola  mirrors that of hexapods as a whole, with similar average size to the global mean  mean =  <dig>  ln , sd =  <dig>  ln , holometabola;  mean =  <dig>  ln , sd =  <dig>  ln ). by contrast both the clades entognatha , sd =  <dig>  ln  and paraneoptera , sd =  <dig>  ln  are predominantly composed of groups falling at the small end of the size spectrum, the latter particularly with respect to minimum sizes, while large insects include disproportionate representation of polyneoptera , sd =  <dig>  ln ) and palaeoptera ); mean =  <dig>  ln , sd =  <dig>  ln ).

the value of the inferred standard deviation of the terminal distributions shows a rather different phylogenetic pattern from that of the mean size values, although after taking phylogeny into account the two are strongly correlated . clades associated with particularly low values of standard deviation  include trichoptera, neuropterida , psocodea and odonata while the largest values occur in coleoptera and advanced lepidoptera , with the single largest value occurring in the morphologically diverse  but species poor lepidoptera family aididae .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic plot of  size traits. a mean-of-logs body length;  estimated standard deviation. ancestral reconstruction of internal nodes based on a bm process  . lower bars denote the minimum and maximum values of observed traits ); coloration on a red to blue scale. terminal bars denote membership of major clades; colors as fig. 1




phylogenetic distribution of body size and ancestral states
the above patterns are reinforced on the phylogenetic ancestral reconstruction plots for the group , in which the following clades show strong deviations from the average size dynamics: odonata , psocodea , micro-hymenoptera  and various polyneopteran clades, notably phasmatodea and orthoptera. beyond these limited examples, the majority of hexapod higher taxa log-means lie close to global average size, and ancestral reconstruction of internal nodes rapidly approaches this value as an approximation of the global ancestral state.

evidence of phylogenetic signal was recovered in both the full dataset and in all the major sub-clades  with very strong support, with the exception of entognatha, where evidence of structuring is present but support is much lower . blomberg’s k values indicate that hexapoda as a whole demonstrate somewhat lower values of k than would be expected under a brownian motion  process, consistent with related species resembling one another less than under the expected bm distribution . similar patterns are also identified in holometabola and polyneoptera. by contrast, paraneoptera and palaeoptera show strong tendencies towards higher-than-expected values of k, indicating differences in the size evolution process among major clades.table  <dig> tests of phylogenetic signal within major clades incorporating within-terminal standard error

process of body size evolution
considering the potential processes responsible for generating observed patterns of size evolution , our data suggest that, of our process based models; the majority of hexapod clades favor simple brownian motion, with the exception of holometabola, where the favored process is an single stationary peak  model with convergence on a single global optimum or elevated diversification at distant tips . however, when models without an explicit generating process are considered ), this picture changes, such that for hexapoda as a whole and holometabola, there is evidence for considerable non-phylogenetic signal in body size, resulting in lambda values that significantly diverge from the expectations of bm . similar patterns are obtained when the major holometabolan orders are examined individually, with hymenoptera , coleoptera  and lepidoptera  all favoring bm processes, while diptera  shows strong evidence for non-phylogenetic signal . the implications of these differences for our understanding of size evolution in hexapods, and particularly within holometabola and diptera, will be explored below.table  <dig> parameter estimates and relative likelihoods for models of mean-of-logs body size incorporating within-terminal standard error

the findings of bayesian analysis of macro-evolutionary mixtures  further support the idea that the process of size evolution behaves differently in holometabolan and non-holometabolan groups . a single shift in the rate model associated with the origins of holometabola is recovered with a marginal probability of  <dig> , i.e. it is found in > 95 % of all sampled models from the post burn-in chain. the single most sampled configuration recovers only this shift , suggesting that the impact of other events on size evolution within the group is comparatively marginal. this regime shift in holometabola is associated with a reversal in the rate of size evolution, such that within this clade rates appear to accelerate through time, contrasting with the weak deceleration observed across the remaining hexapods . the only other nodes found to significantly contribute to heterogeneity in size evolution within hexapods are associated with decelerations in size evolution within trichoptera, both when including  and when excluding ) the basal family hydroptilidae.fig.  <dig> outputs of bayesian analysis of macroevolutionary mixtures  analysis of log mean body size data. mean rate of evolution for branches across all post-burnin samples  per million years), denoted by branch coloration 



discussion
the findings of this study corroborate previous taxonomic surveys at continental scales  suggesting that the distribution of body lengths in hexapod families does not show a strong skew towards an over-abundance of small sized taxa on the log scale. we also demonstrate that, while size does show phylogenetic structuring with respect to different hexapod groups, after accounting for these relationships and the variances observed within tip groups, there is no global negative association between body length and diversification across the studied taxa. finally, our survey of possible evolutionary models suggests that the pattern and processes of size evolution in holometabola, and possibly diptera, are distinct from those of other hexapod groups. in both cases evidence for non-phylogenetic signal suggests that these differences cannot be adequately accounted for in single parameter extensions of brownian motion, although for other groups, body size evolution looks approximately brownian.

the recognition that body length distributions in hexapoda show relatively little bias on a log scale, and that diversification rates within the group are approximately independent of size, supports the idea that concepts derived from the study of vertebrate groups  <cit>  may be inappropriate when discussing other taxonomic groups  <cit> , and hexapods in particular  <cit> . possible explanations for these differences focus on the potential for small absolute body size to alter the link between body-size and clade diversification. for example, small-bodied organisms experience distinct flow conditions where viscous forces, such as surface tension and air resistance, have the potential to overwhelm the effect of the gravitational forces  that are responsible for structuring body size changes at larger spatial scales  <cit> . likewise, fractal environmental models, which postulate the existence of a higher number of niches at small body sizes  <cit> , may become inapplicable below a certain scale, particularly with respect to “parasitic” taxa, which live on the surface of larger host organisms , and are therefore subject to local homogeneity in the composition of their environment across a range of spatial scales  <cit> . in addition with respect to hexapods, despite a general trend towards larger-bodied organisms showing greater reproductive output, there is evidence from well-studied systems to suggest that this pattern is not universal across the group  <cit> . thus, several of the mechanisms typically invoked to account for size-biased diversification in vertebrates may not be applicable to hexapoda, reflecting a potential danger of extrapolation from well-studied, but atypical clades to describe global evolutionary processes  <cit> . there is a need to further investigate processes of size evolution across a broader range of invertebrate groups for comparative purposes , which, when taken together, may provide us with new insights into underlying mechanisms controlling the size structuring of natural environments  <cit> .

despite the presence of non-phylogenetic signal in some specific groups, there is considerable evidence that the majority of hexapod clades are strongly phylogenetic structured with respect to body size, and hence size evolution within hexapoda is broadly described by a bm process on the log scale. however, many specific clades appear, within the limits of available data, to be constrained to a particular subset of possible sizes. the mechanisms underlying such constraint are likely to be variable across different lineages. for example, the absence of small body sizes within odonata may be attributed to limitations on the minimum size required for the group’s unique flight mechanism  <cit> . in other cases, the causes of constraint are much less apparent, e.g. the absence of large bodied members of the order psocodea , which may reflect constraints of a cryptic and concealed lifestyle in a group that has received comparatively little detailed study. the effect of such constraints at the super-ordinal scale appears to be marginal, as all of the major lineages demonstrated a wide variation in size as well as homogeneity of process within clades . the overriding impression therefore is that, within the limitations imposed by restricted phylogenetic resolution, size evolution within hexapods is dominated by comparatively localized factors operating at the sub-ordinal or super-familial level.

the reconstruction of estimated standard deviation in body size within hexapoda generated here bears a strong qualitative resemblance to previously recovered patterns of diversification rate shifts across the clade  <cit> . this is particularly striking in that clades previously recovered as downshifted with respect to diversification rate, e.g. psocodea, neuroptera and trichoptera, are here recovered as having comparatively low standard deviation in body size, suggesting a link between the diversification process and radiation into novel morphospace  <cit> . similar ideas have been previously proposed with respect to bird families,  <cit> , but formalized testing via multiple regression has been shown to be statistically problematic, due to an inability to distinguish time-dependent and speciation-dependent generation of variance  <cit> . this, in combination with the data abstraction required to treat higher taxonomic groups here , and the fact that our approaches to estimate standard deviation are confounded with clade richness , meant that we did not feel secure in pursuing this line of investigation within the current study. however, in the presence of better data, particularly for within clade body size distributions, this is an intriguing concept and one that merits further investigation.

when considering the processes that may underlie the evolution of hexapod body size, our analyses identify holometabola and in particular diptera, as having undergone divergent evolutionary processes when compared with the remaining hexapoda . none of the explicit process models explored here were recovered as adequate descriptors of what this divergent process may be, although the bamm analysis of rate heterogeneity suggests a rate acceleration through time may be involved. the  lambda model is not in itself a process description, hence this parameter is most commonly described as a test of phylogenetic signal . despite this limitation, we can conceptually distinguish three possible sources of non-phylogenetic signal that may individually or collectively explain the deviation from bm within these clades: random noise in the dataset , phylogenetic error in taxon assignments, and the presence of complex evolutionary processes that are inadequately accommodated within the single parameter extensions of bm examined above.

focusing on diptera as the extreme case of divergence from bm , it can be noted that, in comparison with e.g. lepidoptera, where the majority of large bodied members are restricted to two derived clades , large bodied flies occur in basal, , intermediate , and highly derived, phylogenetic positions . likewise, miniaturization also occurs in a range of unrelated families, e.g. braulidae , corethrellidae  and phoridae , which collectively may further skew size distributions across the order  <cit> . thus, there is the potential for divergent processes of size evolution within the clade that are not fully captured by the simplistic evolutionary models implemented here. however, noise in the dataset e.g. from the use of regional taxonomic descriptions  as proxies for global size distributions, and phylogenetic uncertainty in relationships, e.g. within schizophora  <cit> , mean that we should be cautious of over-interpreting these patterns and await better comparative information, preferably incorporating developmental and larval data  <cit> . it should also be noted that diptera, and to a lesser extent all holometabola are, in terms of proportion of probable species described, less well-known than comparable groups   <cit> , and thus may be more strongly impacted by collection and modeling biases outlined below.

the apparent association of holometabola with accelerating rates of size evolution through time  is interesting given that complete metamorphosis has previously been identified as a key innovation in hexapod diversification  <cit> . plausible mechanisms for a different process of size evolution within the clade include: modularization of life history stages decoupling adult body-size from larval ecology and so permitting greater adaptive flexibility  <cit> , and historical factors relating to the differential extinction of large bodied non-holometabolan groups  <cit> . there have been various suggestions, based on the small size of early fossil representatives  <cit> , that patterns within holometabola may follow the widely acknowledged principal known as cope’s rule, which postulates that increased niche specialization tends to lead to increased body sizes within a clade over evolutionary time  <cit>  . however, the lack of a joint systematic framework for extant and fossil taxa has restricted formal testing of this assertion in recent fossil compilations .

unlike well-studied vertebrate clades, there is currently no universal reference source for comparative data within hexapoda, nor of the demographic or ecological information that may aid in interpreting models of size evolution  <cit> . as a result, the information used here is derived from a mix of global and regional scale datasets collected at the level of individual clades . this imposes additional assumptions beyond the selection of phylogenetic framework  and the use of described species as proxies for total clade richness  <cit> . there are two major sources of error that may impinge on this analysis and whose extents are problematic to test in the absence of more finely resolved taxonomic data. the first relates to the representative nature of the compiled size limits as accurately reflecting the true size range of studied terminal groups. due to a lack of data for tropical faunas, the information used here includes an over-reliance on north american, australian and european taxa, which, due to the presence of a well-known latitudinal cline in insect body size  <cit> , has the potential to bias the raw data on which our findings are based. while acknowledging that such a bias is difficult to explicitly test, we note that previous work has found evidence that regional data for taxonomic groups is predictive of global patterns with respect to hexapod body size  <cit>  and that by combining multiple regional sets we at least attempt to consolidate our size ranges across the known taxonomic range.

a second subtle source of bias originates from the conversion of raw size range data into lognormal distributions that are the source of the parameters used in our modeling procedure. an implicit assumption of using lognormal distributions is that on the logged scale the data is symmetrical around the mean . however, faunal body size compilations suggest that, with increasing species richness, size distributions becomes increasingly right skewed on the log scale  <cit> , although individual sub-taxa often vary in skew independently of the overall fauna  <cit> . for the global family distributions considered here, available data on size-distributional skew is insufficiently resolved to contribute to the models considered here, and as a result we have elected to retain the explicit linkage between raw observations and parametric descriptors provided by the assumption of log-normality.

another difficult-to-test but implicit assumption in our work is that the probability of species description within terminal taxa is not itself biased by body size  or, to put this another way, that the estimates of described species richness for terminal groups are unbiased approximations of their true extant diversity  <cit> . the problem of acquiring estimates of “true” species richness based on incomplete records of described species is one of the most profound challenges facing work on any diverse clade . of the work conducted here, the observed pattern, i.e. a weak and statistically non-significant positive correlation is potentially consistent with systematic under description of small bodied species; however, this effect would have to be large in-order to mask any “real” negative relationship present within the group. as with many issues relating to unknowns in the richness of large clades, efforts to integrate global taxonomic databases together with associated rates of species description, synonymy resolution and meta-data such as body size, will go a long way towards characterizing what it is that we still do not know regarding hexapod diversity  <cit> .

in addition to description bias, there are also issues relating to the appropriate partitioning of within tip variance, which here we have treated as arising entirely from taxonomic under-sampling. thus, the effect that novel species description would have on the estimate of the mean body size of a given clade depends on the number of described species in this clade , whereas in reality, such estimates also encompass other sources of error such as length variation among individual specimens  <cit>  and sexual dimorphism  <cit> , which may contribute to variation observed across lineages. dealing with within tip variance in trait measurements is perhaps the greatest outstanding challenge in modeling of trait evolution at deep phylogenetic levels  <cit> . the methods used here, based on  <cit> , were originally developed with the aim to incorporate measurement error in tip values, with the result that they contain assumptions regarding the distribution of such variance that may not be appropriate for all of the contributing sources of variance present within this dataset. alternative approaches exist, e.g. “mecca”  <cit> ; however, these involve simulating multiple species-complete trees  and also make strong assumptions regarding variance structure within tip taxa. further work on partitioning variance within phylogenetic models  <cit> , as well as improved understanding in how such variance is structured in groups where there is good phylogenetic information, represents an area of great potential in understanding how trait evolution may be modeled across very large taxonomic groups.

CONCLUSIONS
within the limits of the available data and the neontological approach, our analyses suggest that the evolutionary forces structuring macro-evolutionary patterns of body size within hexapoda are not simply and directly related to those responsible for structuring the diversity of the group. the overall pattern of body size evolution within the group, based on its extant representatives appears to be broadly driven by essentially neutral forces  with the exception of the poorly defined processes operating within holometabola and diptera. this conclusion differs from that of fossil based surveys of the group, which have emphasized constraints in shaping size evolution in hexapods, such as oxygen limitation  and the evolution of vertebrate predators   <cit> . these differences reflect differences in the underlying data, including a focus on the evolution of mean body size within clades as opposed to the limits of its maximum value  <cit> , the inability of analyses based on extant data to take account of no-longer existing diversity  <cit>  and impacts of phylogenetic non-independence, which are often neglected in fossil analyses of hexapods  <cit> .

the consequences of these findings for the standard size paradigm , with its emphasis on vertebrates, in which size and richness show a strong degree of coupling  <cit> , are significant in that they attack the universality of these findings to other terrestrial clades  <cit> . as with any macro-evolutionary study involving incompletely described taxonomic groups, we must pay special attention to the role of missing data and interpolation in defining the observed pattern. hence here we have attempted at a basic level to incorporate within-tip variance into our discussion of body size and diversification. great challenges remain in trying to tease apart ecological and evolutionary processes in groups operating on temporal and spatial scales profoundly different from our own. the analysis presented here thus should be taken as a step on the road towards a broader understanding of the processes of size evolution and its consequences for an invertebrate perspective of the natural world.
