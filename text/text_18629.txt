BACKGROUND
intracerebral haemorrhage  accounts for around  <dig> - 15% of all strokes worldwide, with a higher proportion in asian countries. compared with ischaemic stroke, it causes disproportionate mortality and morbidity  <cit>  and research efforts to understand its pathophysiology are accordingly of high importance  <cit> . brain injury following ich is a dynamic process, due both to rebleeding and to downstream injury pathways activated by the blood clot  <cit> . however, no therapies addressing these secondary injury pathways have been proven beneficial.

one approach to understanding these injury pathways is to study gene expression in animal models using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction . real-time rt-pcr is the method of choice for quantifying mrna transcripts due to its wider dynamic range of quantification, higher sensitivity and precision, and a decreased risk of contamination compared to gel-based pcr  <cit> . data obtained from real-time rt-pcr assays require a reliable method of normalisation to correct for such factors as differences in quantity and quality of rna samples and for efficiency of the reverse transcription reaction  <cit> . several normalisation strategies exist, the most common being the use of one or more endogenously expressed reference genes  <cit> . a reference gene should be expressed at a stable level in different tissue types and be unaffected by the experimental condition under investigation  <cit> . however, several of the most commonly used reference genes, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  and β-actin, have been shown to have variable expression patterns and thus to be unsuitable for normalising real-time rt-pcr data in certain conditions  <cit> . the use of an inappropriate reference gene for normalisation may lead to incorrect data interpretation  <cit> . in contrast, normalisation to the geometric mean of the expression of multiple reference genes  <cit>  is considered to be a reliable and conservative approach  <cit> .

previous studies employing quantitative real-time rt-pcr in rat ich models have utilised a single reference gene for normalisation, usually without including a reference gene validation protocol  <cit> . therefore, as an example, we demonstrate the impact of different reference gene selection methods on determining the transcript levels of transient receptor potential melastatin  <dig>  channels following ich. trpm <dig> consists of a calcium-permeable channel fused to a protein kinase domain  <cit> , and is highly expressed in the brain and immune cells  <cit> . it has been implicated in cell death pathways relating to oxidative stress  <cit>  and ischaemia  <cit>  and its mrna level has been shown to increase in a time-dependent manner following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats  <cit> . no studies to date have quantified the mrna level of trpm <dig> following ich.

we aimed to identify the most appropriate reference genes to normalise real-time rt-pcr data in the collagenase model of ich in rats. accordingly, real-time rt-pcr was used to measure transcript levels of seven reference genes: gapdh, β-2-microglobulin , rna polymerase ii , tata box binding protein , hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase , succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit a  and β-glucuronidase , plus our gene of interest, trpm <dig>  we initially normalised trpm <dig> data to individual reference genes using the relative standard curve method  <cit> . next, a reference gene validation study was conducted using the genorm application  <cit>  to rank reference genes in order of stability. other software programs are also available to assess the stability of candidate reference genes, including normfinder  <cit>  and bestkeeper  <cit> . although different algorithms are utilised in each application, studies have reported fairly consistent reference gene rankings between all three programs, particularly with regard to identifying the least stable genes  <cit> . however, we chose to use genorm in the present study given that it also determines the number of reference genes required for accurate normalisation. the panel of stable reference genes identified by genorm was then applied to normalise data regarding our gene of interest, trpm <dig>  the results presented herein will help to provide a guideline for selecting stable reference genes for normalising real-time rt-pcr data in future studies.

RESULTS
rna concentration and integrity
the concentration of extracted total rna was quantified by measurement of the absorbance at  <dig> nm,  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm using a uv spectrophotometer. all samples had a260:a <dig> ratios of between  <dig>  and  <dig> , and a260:a <dig> ratios of between  <dig>  and  <dig> . rna integrity was assessed using automated micro-capillary electrophoresis in the agilent bioanalyzer. an rna integrity number   was assigned to each sample by the agilent bioanalyzer expert  <dig> software. all rin values obtained were in the range of  <dig>  -  <dig> , representing high quality rna with minimal degradation.

real-time rt-pcr
primer pairs and reaction conditions were optimised using the standard cdna pool prior to amplifying unknown cdna samples. melting curve analysis was consistent with a single reaction product for each gene, and product size was confirmed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis stained with ethidium bromide and visualised with uv light . after validation of primer specificity, real-time pcr was carried out for unknown collagenase ich and saline vehicle cdna samples and serial dilutions from the cdna pool. reaction efficiencies were calculated automatically by the corbett rotor-gene  <dig> software. the efficiency of all runs was between 95% and 105%. minimum r <dig> values of  <dig>  were accepted for each run, however, most runs had r <dig> values over  <dig> .

trpm <dig> mrna level normalised to individual reference genes
the relative standard curve method  <cit>  was used to calculate trpm <dig> mrna level in the perihematomal region of ich and vehicle rats with survival times of  <dig> h and  <dig> h, relative to each of the seven reference genes individually. figure 1a shows trpm <dig> mrna level at  <dig> h post-ich. large variations were observed depending on which reference gene was used for normalisation. at the  <dig> hour time point, when trpm <dig> data were normalised to gusb only, a significant   <dig> -fold increase in mean trpm <dig> mrna level was observed in the collagenase ich rats compared to saline vehicles . a significant   <dig> -fold increase was found in trpm <dig> mrna level when data were normalised to hprt only. when each of the other reference genes was used individually for normalisation, there were no significant differences. given the discrepancy in these results and the large variation between samples, we proceeded with a reference gene evaluation study to determine the most stable reference genes in the collagenase model of ich.

reference gene stability
the genorm v <dig>  application was used to determine the most stable reference genes out of the seven candidate genes tested. we were interested to see whether the stability of the different reference genes was influenced by the different survival times of the collagenase ich rats , and whether the injury itself could produce localised fluctuations in reference genes between the perihematomal  and matching contralateral  regions of the brain. therefore, we used genorm to ascertain the most stable reference genes in the following five groups: a collective group of all collagenase ich and saline vehicle samples;  <dig> hour collagenase ich and saline vehicle samples;  <dig> collagenase ich and all saline vehicle samples; rbg only from all collagenase ich and saline vehicle samples; lbg only from all collagenase ich and saline vehicle samples. the most stable reference genes for each group plus recommended number of reference genes for accurate normalisation are summarised in table  <dig> 

ranking of candidate reference genes in order of stability as determined by genorm. the most stable reference genes are listed at the top and the least stable at the bottom. * indicates number of reference genes required for accurate normalisation of real-time rt-pcr data, revealed by pairwise variation analysis. rbg and lbg refer to the perihematomal and the contralateral region, respectively, of collagenase ich and vehicle rats.

in the combined group of all samples, b2mg and gusb were found to be the most stable reference genes, while tbp was the least stable. indeed, b2mg and gusb were the two most stable reference genes in  <dig> out of the  <dig> groups tested, while tbp was ranked as the least stable gene in all  <dig> groups. overall, hprt displayed variable stability; it was ranked among the least stable two genes in  <dig> out of  <dig> groups, but conversely was among the top two stable genes in the other  <dig> groups. pol2r was never one of the two most stable genes in any group, however, it was consistently ranked as the third most stable reference gene in  <dig> out of  <dig> groups. sdha and gapdh exhibited reasonable stability across the different groups.

trpm <dig> mrna level normalised to multiple reference genes
the qbaseplus program was used to calculate the normalised mrna level of trpm <dig> in the perihematomal brain region at  <dig> h and  <dig> h post-ich, relative to the most stable reference genes for each time point as determined by genorm . qbaseplus utilises a modified version of the 2-ΔΔct method of relative expression analysis  <cit>  that takes into account multiple reference genes and gene-specific amplification efficiencies  <cit> . there was no significant difference in mean trpm <dig> transcript levels between collagenase ich and saline vehicle animals .

discussion
in this study we have evaluated reference genes for use as real-time rt-pcr normalising factors in collagenase-induced ich. based on our results, we conclude that use of a single normalisation reference gene is potentially hazardous, and suggest a panel of reference genes for more accurate transcript quantification.

real-time rt-pcr is a robust and sensitive technique for quantifying mrna transcripts, and constitutes a powerful tool for increasing our understanding of the genomic response to ich. it requires an appropriate normalisation strategy to control for error, the most common being the use of one or more endogenous reference genes  <cit> . a reference gene should be expressed at a stable level regardless of the experimental context, however, the expression of commonly used reference genes has been shown to vary considerably. normalisation of real-time rt-pcr data using a single, non-validated reference gene may lead to inaccurate biological conclusions, and previous studies have highlighted the need to validate reference genes for each new experimental condition  <cit> .

our previous study  <cit>  identified suitable reference genes for normalising real-time rt-pcr data in the rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus following traumatic brain injury . the present study focuses on a different neurological disorder with a different animal model, brain regions and survival times to our previous study. our results demonstrate that the panels of stable reference genes in ich are not the same as those identified in our previous tbi reference gene study  <cit> , consistent with the recommendation that reference gene validation be carried out whenever a new experimental variable is introduced  <cit> . reference gene validation was thus a crucial prerequisite to gene expression analysis in ich, and the current study has identified the appropriate panel of reference genes for further studies.

alternative normalisation strategies include the use of exogenous standards and normalisation to total rna. several groups have reported reliable normalisation with exogenous standards  <cit> . a known amount of exogenous standard can be incorporated into the rna extraction process, which will then be affected by the same experimental error as the rna of interest  <cit> . however, exogenous standards can be difficult to produce and are subject to degradation, and do not control for differences in quality of rna template  <cit> . another approach is to normalise to total rna mass, which consists predominantly of ribosomal rna  molecules. however, it has been shown that rrna content is not always an accurate predictor of the mrna fraction  <cit> . furthermore, normalisation to total rna does not control for errors introduced during reverse transcription or pcr  <cit> .

to our knowledge, this is the only study which has validated reference genes for use as normalising factors in the collagenase model of ich in rats. we quantified the transcript level of seven candidate reference genes  and our gene of interest, trpm <dig>  in the perihematomal and matching contralateral regions in rats  <dig> and  <dig> hours following collagenase-induced ich, as well as in saline vehicle controls. initially, data regarding trpm <dig> transcript level in the perihematomal region were normalised to individual reference genes using the relative standard curve method of analysis  <cit> . at the  <dig> h survival time point, when trpm <dig> data were normalised to either gusb or hprt, significant differences were found. however, no differences were found when normalised to other commonly-used reference genes. there was considerable variation between samples when data were analysed in this way . however, with normalisation to a reference gene panel far more consistent results were obtained . had we used hprt or gusb as a single reference gene for normalisation, it is likely that we would have drawn erroneous conclusions about our data. these results highlight the importance of validating the stability of reference genes to be used as normalising factors in real-time rt-pcr studies.

when analysing all ich and saline vehicle samples together, the most stable reference genes were b2mg and gusb, with four reference genes recommended as the optimal number for accurate normalisation. the inclusion of additional reference genes further decreases the value of v, even when all seven genes are used for normalisation . however, once the threshold value of  <dig>  has been reached, additional reference genes do not significantly increase the reliability of normalisation  <cit> . although the observed differences in reference gene stability were subtle, this does not imply that any reference gene combination would be appropriate. to illustrate this point, removing the  <dig> most stable reference genes  from our genorm input file showed that gapdh, hprt, sdha and tbp assessed together do not meet the proposed cut-off value of v . therefore, the most stable four genes, as determined by genorm, should be used.

we also compared the stability of the candidate reference genes at individual time points following collagenase-induced ich . the most stable genes at  <dig> hours  were different to those at  <dig> hours . intriguingly, b2mg and gusb were among the least stable genes in the  <dig> hour group, while gapdh and hprt were ranked 4th and 6th, respectively, at  <dig> hours post-ich. these results clearly demonstrate that stability of a candidate reference gene at one time point does not necessarily confer stability at another. therefore, it is likely that the use of a single reference gene would be inadequate for normalising real-time rt-pcr data from different survival times of ich. this is relevant because, as discussed, previous studies utilising real-time rt-pcr in rodent models of ich generally have used one reference gene for normalisation without including a validation protocol. for example, hprt was one of the most variably expressed genes in our study, but has been used as a single normalising factor in other studies quantifying mrnas of interest over a time course of ich  <cit> . it is possible that studies using a single, non-validated reference gene for normalisation could fail to detect small changes in the mrna species of interest  <cit> , or erroneously conclude that changes have occurred  <cit> . indeed, another study from our laboratory  <cit>  demonstrated that the mrna level of our gene of interest varied significantly when normalised to individual reference genes, but was far more reliable when a panel of validated reference genes were used for normalisation.

the candidate reference genes in the present study also showed differences in stability between the perihematomal brain and the uninjured contralateral region. as might be expected, differences in gene stability were most marked in the perihaematomal region. a cascade of pathological processes including excitotoxicity, oedema and inflammation are initiated by ich  <cit> , all of which may impact reference gene expression.

CONCLUSIONS
we have evaluated the expression stability of seven candidate reference genes following collagenase-induced ich in rats. we have identified b2mg, gusb, pol2r and gapdh as an appropriate panel of reference genes to be used in the acute phase  of experimental ich. when analysed in subsets of these samples , variations in the stability of the reference genes were revealed. our gene of interest, trpm <dig>  was inconsistently elevated following injury when normalised to individual reference genes. however, when normalised to a panel of the most stable genes, no significant differences were seen. these results emphasise the importance of identifying and validating suitable reference genes to prevent erroneous conclusions. the results of the present study will enable more accurate normalisation of real-time rt-pcr data at  <dig> and  <dig> hour time points following collagenase-induced ich.
