BACKGROUND
enterohemorrhagic e. coli  are associated with gastrointestinal and systemic illness in humans. this illness can range in severity from uncomplicated diarrhea to hemorrhagic colitis and the sometimes fatal hemolytic uremic syndrome  <cit> . ehec strains possess a number of common virulence traits, such as the production of one or more types of antigenically distinct shiga toxins , a large plasmid that encodes an enterohemolysin, and a chromosomal gene cluster termed the locus of enterocyte effacement  that is found in most, but not all ehec serotypes  <cit> .

e. coli o157:h <dig> is the ehec serotype most often associated with disease outbreaks and with the onset of severe disease in the u.s., canada, japan, and the u.k.  <cit> . genomic sequencing of two outbreak-related e. coli o157:h <dig> strains, sakai and edl  <dig>  revealed that there are many phage-related sequences and genomic islands scattered throughout the chromosome of this organism and that many of these genetic elements encode potential virulence attributes  <cit> . these e. coli o157:h7-specific genomic segments are dispersed throughout  <dig> different regions of a common genomic backbone that is shared with the distantly related e. coli k- <dig>  known as s-loops and o-islands  in sakai and edl <dig> strains, respectively, some of the regions must be responsible for the virulence characteristics that were acquired during evolution of e. coli o157:h <dig> 

e. coli o157:h <dig> strains are believed to comprise a clonal complex of related genotypes that are found worldwide  <cit> . it has been suggested that e. coli o157:h <dig> arose from the enteropathogenic e. coli serotype o55:h <dig> through sequential acquisition of virulence traits and serotype change  <cit> . a step-wise evolution of e. coli o157:h <dig> from enteropathogenic e. coli o55:h <dig> was recently proposed, based on the properties of specific existent strains that carry intermediate characteristics and are presumed to represent intermediates in the evolution of this ehec serotype  <cit> . the proposed evolutionary pathway includes lysogenization by an stx2-converting phage followed by a shift in serotype from o <dig> to o <dig> brought about by acquisition of the o <dig> gnd-rfb locus  <cit> . the ehec large plasmid was then acquired by the organism and the ability to ferment sorbitol was lost. the sorbitol-non-fermenting o157:h <dig> ancestor was subsequently lysogenized with an stx1-converting phage and, finally, acquired a frameshift mutation in the uida gene, resulting in loss of β-glucuronidase activity  <cit> . the validity of this stepwise model is supported by recent comparative genomic hybridization  studies using e. coli o157:h <dig> whole genome-based oligonucleotide microarrays  <cit> .

it is well recognized that e. coli o157:h <dig> populations have a bovine reservoir and that the organism is likely adapted for life in the ruminant gastrointestinal tract  <cit> . using octamer-based genome scanning , kim et al., showed that stx-producing, β-glucuronidase and sorbitol-negative e. coli o157:h <dig> strains have diverged into two distinct lineages, lineages i and ii, and that descendants of these two lineages appear to have distinct ecological characteristics  <cit> . populations of the two lineages are widespread in cattle in both the u.s. and australia, suggesting that these two lineages have been disseminated throughout the global cattle population  <cit> . analysis of a set of nearly  <dig>  e. coli o157:h <dig> strains showed that lineage i strains are more commonly associated with human disease than lineage ii strains, suggesting that there may be differences in virulence characteristics or transmissibility between these two taxonomic groups of e. coli o157:h <dig> strains  <cit> .

although high resolution comparative studies have indicated that prophages are associated with divergence of e. coli o157:h <dig> strains  <cit> , systematic analysis of genetic distinctions between lineage i and lineage ii strains has only recently been undertaken. we  <cit>  and others  <cit>  have recently reported that the q anti-terminator gene found upstream of the stx <dig> operon in e. coli o157:h <dig> differs between lineage i and ii strains. possession of the stx <dig> gene is thought to be associated with the occurrence of more severe disease, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome, caused by ehec strains  <cit> . in addition, dowd and ishizaki  <cit>  recently used oligonucleotide mini-arrays to compare expression of a set of  <dig> genes between three lineage i and three lineage ii strains, noting differential expression of stx <dig> as well as a number of other potentially virulence-associated genes under anaerobic growth conditions. collectively, these published studies suggest that these lineages are genetically distinct and that lineage-specific genetic differences may be responsible for phenotypic differences between members of these two lineages.

to systematically identify lineage-specific genome segments, microarray-based cgh was used in this study to catalogue genomic alterations that are unique to lineage i or lineage ii strains. the oligonucleotide microarray was based on the genome sequences of two lineage i, human outbreak-related e. coli o157:h <dig> strains, sakai  <cit>  and edl <dig>  <cit>  and the nonpathogenic e. coli k <dig>  strain  <cit>  and it was used to probe the genomes of a collection of e. coli o157:h <dig> strains. although significant strain-strain variation was observed, our focus was on genome alterations that were conserved within different strains of a given lineage. regions of divergence identified by cgh were then cloned and sequenced to gain additional insight into the genomic differences between the two lineages. the results of the study show that many lineage-specific differences in genomic content involve genes that are known or potentially virulence-associated. these findings may be used to identify candidate genes that could confer lineage-specific traits related to unique ecological or virulence characteristics.

RESULTS
validation of microarray data by comparison with sequence data
in the cgh experiments,  <dig>  probes from the mwg e. coli o157:h <dig> array set hybridized with a mixture of labelled dna from the three reference strains  yielded adequate signals and these probes were used for all subsequent analysis. for e. coli o157:h <dig> edl <dig>  5221/ <dig>  of the probes with  <dig> % identity to the corresponding sequence gave the expected results . among the  <dig> probes that were expected to hybridize but did not with dna from e. coli o157:h <dig> strain edl <dig>   <dig>  were negative and  <dig>  were uncertain according to the gack analysis. while for the e. coli o157:h <dig> sakai strain only 4951/ <dig>  of the probes with  <dig> % identity to the corresponding sequence gave the expected results. for strain sakai,  <dig>  were negative and  <dig>  were uncertain based on gack analysis. however, twenty-one of the probes with 100% identity to e. coli sakai sequence that did not generate a positive signal with e. coli sakai dna were homologous to orfs in s-loop# <dig>  <cit> . this s-loop is equivalent to oi# <dig> in e. coli o157:h <dig> edl <dig>  pcr experiments revealed that the sakai strain used in this study has a deletion of these orfs in s-loop# <dig> while the corresponding oi in edl <dig> was intact .

genomic variability in lineage i and lineage ii e. coli o157:h <dig> strains
in order to distinguish lineage-specific differences from strain-strain variability, multiple strains belonging to three different genotypic groups were tested. our strain set included fifteen different lspa genotype  <dig> strains , four different lspa type  <dig> strains  and  <dig> different lineage ii strains of lspa types  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  characteristics of the strains used in the study are presented in table  <dig>  and data from microarray hybridization experiments with these e. coli o157:h <dig> strains are presented in the supplemental material . a total of  <dig>  of the  <dig>  probes hybridized with all e. coli o157:h <dig> strains tested, indicating that this set of genes likely represents the conserved core genome of the ancestral e. coli o157:h <dig> population that has been maintained during its evolution. there were  <dig> probes that hybridized only with dna from e. coli k <dig> and not with any of the e. coli o157:h <dig> strains tested, including two probes  that were expected to hybridize with edl <dig> and sakai dna, based on sequence identity. the remaining  <dig> probes showed significant variability in microarray hybridization signals among e. coli o157:h <dig> strains , and the orfs that they represent were designated as variably absent or present .

of these  <dig>  vap,  <dig> hybridized with only one of the  <dig> e. coli o157:h <dig> strains tested and  <dig> hybridized with all but one of the  <dig> e. coli o157:h <dig> strains tested. initial functional classification of the  <dig> vap genes showed that  <dig>  were encoded by prophage or phage-like elements found in the k- <dig>  edl <dig> and sakai genomes and  <dig>  were located within k-island , o-island , or s-loop genomic islands  <cit> . the distribution of vap genes in the genomes of e. coli edl <dig> and sakai and the percentage of the  <dig> e. coli o157:h <dig> strains that were divergent for each gene were plotted . in this study, "lineage-specific" refers to the presence of single orfs or orf clusters exclusively in a given lineage, while "lineage-dominant" refers to the presence of single orfs or orf clusters in ≥80% of the strains of one lineage and their absence from ≥90% of strains of other lineages.

lineage- and phage type-specific and lineage and phage type-dominant orfs
a total of  <dig> of the  <dig>  vap orfs were either specific or dominant to a lineage, lspa type or pt .

i) s-loop#14/oi#7
three lineage i and lineage i/ii-specific orfs, ecs <dig>  ecs <dig>  and ecs <dig>  were identified in s-loop#14/oi# <dig> by cgh . the nucleotide sequence  of this region in the lineage ii strain frik  <dig> was homologous to sakai sequence, except that a stretch of dna extending from the 3' end of ecs <dig> to the 5' end of ecs <dig> was missing. the missing orfs encode rearrangement hot spot  proteins and hypothetical proteins in e. coli sakai.

ii) s-loop#16/oi#8
eight e. coli s-loop#16/oi# <dig> orfs were identified as being lineage i and lineage i/ii-specific by cgh . s-loop# <dig> corresponds to tandem prophages sp <dig> and sp <dig> in e. coli sakai, and the majority of lineage i and lineage i/ii-specific orfs in this region were homologous to prophage genes. repeated attempts to amplify the divergent region in s-loop# <dig> by long template pcr with frik  <dig> dna were unsuccessful.

iii) s-loop#69/oi#45
s-loop#69/oi# <dig> corresponds to the stx2-converting bacteriophage sp <dig>  in e. coli sakai. cgh revealed that this region was not only highly divergent but also showed lineage- and lspa type -dominant patterns of divergence . among the  <dig> e. coli o157:h <dig> strains examined, only lineage i strain  <dig>  did not have a positive signal for stx <dig> a and b subunit genes. in  <dig>  other orfs in this region were also divergent suggesting that bacteriophage sp <dig> was not present in its genome.

there were two clusters of lineage and lspa type divergent orfs in s-loop# <dig>  the first cluster, consisting of orfs ecs <dig> to ecs <dig> located upstream of the stx <dig> genes in e. coli sakai, was missing in all four lineage i/ii and the  <dig> lineage ii strains but was conserved in all lineage i strains except strain  <dig>  the orfs within this cluster encoded putative bacteriophage proteins and hypothetical proteins.

the second cluster of divergent orfs in s-loop#69/oi# <dig> consisted of  <dig> orfs, that were missing in  <dig> out of  <dig> lineage ii strains and present in all four lineage i/ii strains and  <dig> of  <dig> lineage i strains. these lineage i-dominant orfs were located downstream of the stx <dig> genes and encoded putative bacteriophage proteins and hypothetical proteins and correspond to the late region of sp <dig> of sakai. pcr primers that flank s-loop# <dig>  were used to amplify the corresponding dna fragment in the lineage ii e. coli strain frik  <dig>  the nucleotide sequence of the amplicon showed that sakai sp <dig> prophage is not integrated into the chromosome at this site in e. coli frik  <dig> 

iv) s-loop#72/oi# <dig>  48
s-loop# <dig> in e. coli sakai, which corresponds to duplicate oi# <dig> and oi# <dig> in e. coli edl <dig>  consists of the degenerate prophage sple <dig> in sakai. s-loop# <dig> and oi# <dig>  are also called tellurite resistance- and adherence-conferring islands because they contain genes responsible for these phenotypes  <cit> . putative virulence-associated orfs located outside of the lineage i and lineage i/ii-specific cluster, including the urease genes , genes for tellurite resistance , and iha    <cit> , were found by cgh to be conserved in all e. coli o157:h <dig> strains tested. however,  <dig> orfs within s-loop# <dig> were lineage i and lineage i/ii-specific . the nucleotide sequence  of the frik  <dig> amplification product obtained for this region had high similarity to the e. coli sakai sequences, except that a segment  <dig>  kb from the 3' end of ecs <dig> to the 5' end of ecs <dig> was missing. the missing region includes two putative transposases ecs <dig> and ecs <dig>  which were not identified by cgh. with the exception of ecs <dig>  which encodes a hecb-like protein, and ecs <dig> , a perc-homologue  <cit> , all other lineage i and lineage i/ii-specific orfs in this region encode hypothetical proteins.

v) s-loop#78/oi#51
s-loop#78/oi# <dig>  which corresponds to prophage sp <dig> in sakai, contained a cluster of  <dig> orfs, located between ecs <dig> and ecs <dig> of e. coli sakai, that was absent from all lineage ii and lineage i/ii strains but present in all lineage i strains . the s-loop# <dig> divergent orfs encoded hypothetical proteins of unknown function and putative bacteriophage-associated proteins. another orf present in this region, ecs <dig>   <cit> , which encodes a perc-homologue, was present in all lineage i and lineage i/ii strains but not ten of the twelve lineage ii strains tested. repeated attempts to amplify the divergent region in s-loop# <dig> by long template pcr with frik  <dig> dna were unsuccessful.

vi) s-loop#83/oi#55
a cluster of  <dig> lineage i and lineage i/ii-specific orfs, ecs1691-ecs <dig>  were detected across s-loop#83/oi# <dig> and its surrounding sequences . five orfs within the boundaries of s-loop# <dig>  orfs ecs1693-ecs <dig>  are homologous to the prra-modd-yc73-fepc gene cluster located on the pyelonephritis and cystitis pathogenicity island of uropathogenic e. coli cft <dig>  which was proposed to be involved in iron uptake in this strain  <cit> . the s-loop# <dig> orfs ecs1698-ecs <dig> located immediately downstream from this gene cluster are also conserved in e. coli cft <dig> and encode putative transport proteins that may be involved in iron transport. two lineage i- and lineage i/ii-specific orfs located upstream of s-loop# <dig> encoded hypothetical proteins, and five lineage i- and lineage i/ii-specific orfs located downstream of s-loop# <dig> encoded components of the e. coli phosphotransferase system , or pts-dependent dihydroxyacetone kinase enzymes. these are ecs <dig> and ecs <dig>  which together are homologous to the periplasmic trehalase trea in e. coli k <dig>  <cit> , ecs <dig>  a putative pts system enzyme i ycgc gene, and ecs <dig> and ecs <dig>  which encode putative dihydroxyacetone kinase genes dhak <dig> and dhak <dig> 

the pcr fragment amplified with dna from frik  <dig> showed that both the lineage i- and lineage i/ii-specific orfs identified by cgh as well as two putative transposases were missing. the frik  <dig> sequence  also showed that a portion of e. coli k <dig> dna sequence  that was absent from e. coli sakai was present in the chromosome of frik  <dig>  the e. coli k <dig> sequence in this region contained portions of b <dig> and b <dig> orfs, which encode a pts-dependent dihydroxyacetone kinase operon regulator dhar and a protein of unknown function with both pertactin adhesin and autotransporter domains, respectively.

vii) s-loop#85/oi#71
two lineage i- and lineage i/ii-specific orf were detected in s-loop#85/oi# <dig>  which corresponds to sakai prophage sp <dig> . the recently described non-lee encoded effectors nlea, nleh1- <dig> and nlef are encoded by orfs ecs <dig>  ecs <dig> and ecs <dig>  respectively, within this s-loop  <cit> . although ecs <dig> and ecs <dig> were lineage i and lineage i/ii-specific, ecs <dig> was present in all e. coli o157:h <dig> strains tested. repeated attempts to amplify this divergent region in s-loop# <dig> by pcr with frik  <dig> dna were unsuccessful.

viii) sp10
the sakai prophage sp <dig> region, which is described as a hypervariable locus in edl <dig>  contains s-loops  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  sixteen orfs within this prophage were observed to be lineage i-specific and one lineage-dominant . this region of divergence in lineage i/ii and lineage ii strains extends from the prophage integrase ecs <dig> to the hypothetical protein ecs <dig>  most of the downstream orfs in prophage sp <dig>  however, are not represented in the mwg microarray, so it could not be determined if these orfs were present or absent in the e. coli o157:h <dig> strains tested. based on dna sequence analysis , the region corresponding to sp <dig> in e. coli sakai dna was missing entirely from lineage ii strain frik  <dig>  this prophage contains predominantly orfs that encode for hypothetical proteins and bacteriophage-associated proteins. other orfs of interest within this region include ecs <dig> and ecs <dig>  which encode proteins with low homology to bacteriophage regulatory proteins, and ecs <dig>  which encodes a putative cu-zn superoxide dismutase.

ix) s-loop#153/oi#93
s-loop#153/oi# <dig> corresponds to the stx1-converting prophage sp <dig> in e. coli sakai. all lineage i/ii and lineage ii strains and the lineage i pt <dig> strain lrh <dig> were divergent in sakai orfs ecs <dig> to ecs <dig> within s-loop# <dig> . the orfs ecs <dig> and ecs <dig> encode putative regulatory proteins, while the others encode hypothetical proteins of unknown function or prophage-related proteins. repeated attempts to amplify this divergent region in s-loop# <dig> by pcr with frik  <dig> dna were unsuccessful. however, nucleotide sequence analysis of dna amplified from the region extending from the flanking region to within the stx1-converting prophage showed that integration site of the prophage to be the same in both the lineage ii strain frik  <dig> and lineage i strain sakai .

x) s-loop#286/oi#172
s-loop#286/oi# <dig> corresponds to a cryptic prophage-like element sple <dig> in e. coli sakai. ten orfs in this region in sakai and edl <dig> were present in all lineage i/ii strains and all lineage i strains except those of pt  <dig> but not lineage ii strains . the corresponding region  in e. coli frik  <dig> was homologous to e. coli sakai dna sequence but was missing the dna segment corresponding to the sple <dig> element . the divergent sple <dig> orfs include bacteriophage-associated genes and several genes encoding hypothetical proteins of unknown function. one of these hypothetical genes, ecs <dig>  was shown through transposon mutagenesis to be required for intestinal colonization in calves  <cit> . another orf, ecs <dig>  is a putative transcriptional regulator.

xi) ki# <dig>  ki# <dig>  and e. coli genomic backbone
four orfs in k-island  # <dig>  and four orfs in ki# <dig>  were identified as being present in all lineage ii strains but not lineage i strains. only the two orfs in ki# <dig>  were also present in lineage i/ii strains. all of these orfs above encode hypothetical proteins of unknown function .

two orfs, b <dig> and b <dig>  which were located on the conserved e. coli genomic backbone, were only found in e. coli k <dig> and e. coli o157:h <dig> lineage i/ii and lineage ii strains . orfs b <dig> and b <dig> encode a putative sensor-type regulator and a putative adhesion and penetration protein, respectively. lineage i strain e. coli sakai possesses truncated versions of these orfs.

two other orfs found in the e. coli genomic backbone, b <dig> and b <dig>  were lineage i and lineage i/ii-specific. these orfs encode a putative trans-aconitate methyltransferase enzyme and a hypothetical membrane protein of unknown function. dna sequence analysis  demonstrated that these two orfs were incomplete in lineage ii strain frik <dig> 

lineage, lspa type and phage type distribution of orfs in other virulence-related genomic islands
all genes in s-loop#205/oi# <dig>  which encode two toxins and a pagc-like virulence factor, were conserved among all e. coli o157:h <dig> strains, except for orf ecs <dig>  this orf, which encode a putative adherence factor, was divergent in the lineage ii strain frik  <dig>  in s-loop#225/oi# <dig>  which contains genes for a fatty acid biosynthesis system, only the putative acyl carrier gene ecs <dig> showed variation, and this variation was not lineage-related. all other orfs in s-loop#225/oi# <dig> were conserved across all e. coli o157:h <dig> strains examined. in the lee-containing s-loop#244/oi# <dig>  <cit> , all orfs were conserved across all e. coli o157:h <dig> strains examined, except for five orfs encoding hypothetical proteins within the prophage sple <dig> region of the lee , which encode a putative integrase and genes for hypothetical proteins of unknown function. these orfs were missing in seven lineage ii strains . the conserved lee genes included eae, which encodes γ-intimin, tir , map , the genes for the type iii secretion system , and genes encoding the system's other secreted proteins   <cit> . homologues of non-lee encoded effector nleabcd genes of citrobacter rodentium   <cit> , were present in all e. coli o157:h <dig> strains tested, although non-lee encoded effectors nleh1- <dig>  and nlef  of s-loop# <dig>  <cit>  and putative transcriptional regulator pchd  of s-loop# <dig>  <cit> , were both lineage i and lineage i/ii-specific . other virulence-associated genes, such as espf , enterotoxin-encoding sen , porcine epec o <dig> paa gene homologue , and calcium-binding and heat-extractable autotransporter gene cah , were present in all of the e. coli o157:h <dig> strains examined  <cit> .

genomic characteristics of the lineage-specific segments
to visualize the distribution of the lineage-specific and lineage-dominant genome segments, the segments were mapped onto the o157:h <dig> strain sakai genome using microbial genome viewer  <cit>  along with plots of codon adaptation indices  and gc content. as shown in figure  <dig>  the lineage-specific segments  are distributed throughout several segments of the genome, with two main clusters . correlation exists between positioning of the lineage-specific segments and the origin and terminus of chromosome replication. nearly half of the lineage i-specific segments  are concentrated in a  <dig>  mb segment of the genome that includes the replication terminus  while several segments in the m-n region are likewise clustered near the replication origin, positioned at  <dig>  mb. however, there appears to be some bias in the distribution of the lineage-specific segments with respect to the two replichores, with segments n-h occurring within replichore  <dig> while only segments i-m are found in replichore  <dig>  replichore  <dig> is  <dig> kb longer than replichore  <dig> in the sakai genome sequence  <cit> , which is a lineage i strain, and it is possible that symmetry is a driving force in shaping the genomes of the lineage ii strains.

genomotyping of e. coli o157:h <dig> strains
a dendrogram based on the pearson correlation analysis of microarray data for all  <dig> e. coli o157:h <dig> strains is presented in figure  <dig>  three distinct groups of strains, corresponding to lineage i, lineage i/ii  and lineage ii  strains are evident. the three pt <dig> strains within lineage i are grouped close to each other in the dendrogram. in contrast, pt <dig> and pt <dig> strains  display variable genetic distances with respect to other strains of the same pt and other strains of different pts within the same obgs lineage.

discussion
to our knowledge this is the first time that cgh has been applied to such a diverse collection of e. coli o157:h <dig> strains. results of this study suggest that cgh is a robust and discriminating method for comparing large numbers of e. coli o157:h <dig> strains. twenty-one of the oligonucleotides with divergent signals for sakai dna formed part of the s-loop#108/oi# <dig> genomic island which was confirmed to be missing from both of the sakai strains in our collection , suggesting that this element was lost during storage or subculture in the laboratory. there are a number of phage-related orfs in s-loop# <dig> , and the contribution of this gene cluster, if any to the survival and/or virulence of e. coli o157:h <dig> strains in nature is unknown. the high level of agreement between the cgh hybridization signals observed and the expected results for orfs that were reported to be present and those that were reported to be divergent suggests that cgh is a reliable method of determining genomic composition. furthermore, all areas of lineage i-specific divergence were in clusters of two or more orfs, so it seems unlikely that the divergent regions observed in this study are a result of printing or hybridization errors.

an additional line of evidence in support of the reliability of the cgh data was obtained from parallel selective subtractive hybridization  studies conducted by our research group  <cit> . cgh identified all of the nine lineage i-dominant chromosomal genomic regions identified by ssh as well as two additional ones. finally, in several of the areas where lineage i-specific divergence was inferred using cgh, sequence differences between these two lineages were verified following amplification, cloning and sequencing of dna from the lineage ii e. coli strain frik  <dig>  taken together, these findings represent a rigorous and comprehensive validation of the cgh data presented in this study.

the cgh data presented in this study provide evidence of both regions of genomic stability and regions of genomic variability that exist within populations of e. coli o157:h <dig>  a total of  <dig> oligonucleotides hybridized with dna from all of the  <dig> e. coli o157:h <dig> strains tested. the orfs which hybridized with these oligonucleotide probes approximate the conserved portion of the e. coli o157:h <dig> genome and likely include the core genes required for survival of this bacterial pathogen  <cit> . wick et al identified  <dig> conserved genes in e. coli o157:h <dig> and closely related e. coli o55:h <dig> strains using the same oligonucleotide set that was used in this study  <cit> , however, a very limited number of o <dig> and o157-related strains were examined in the latter study. in contrast, dobrindt et al. identified  <dig> core genes in the genomes of  <dig> e. coli strains of different serotypes associated with both intestinal and extra-intestinal illness  <cit> . it would seem reasonable to hypothesize that the larger the collection of strains from a specific e. coli serotype and the more diverse the collection of e. coli strains, the fewer core genes and the more vap genes that would be encountered.

a total of  <dig> vap orfs were identified in e. coli o157:h <dig> strains in the present study. these orfs existed as clusters across the e. coli sakai and edl <dig> chromosomes . the number of vap orfs identified in this study was significantly higher than that identified in the cgh study by ogura et al.  <cit>  which employed an e. coli sakai-based microarray to examine genomic variability within eight human e. coli o157:h <dig> isolates. the higher number of vap orfs observed in this study, likely reflects the higher number of strains tested, the inclusion of both human and bovine-derived strains, and the fact that the mwg microarray used in this study is based on orfs from e. coli o157:h <dig> sakai and edl <dig> strains and an e. coli k <dig> strain rather than just e. coli sakai.

in addition to genomotyping an extensive collection of e. coli o157:h <dig> strains, we used cgh to compare the genomic profiles of e. coli o157:h <dig> lineage i, lineage i/ii and lineage ii strains. these observations extend well beyond those obtained from previous e. coli k <dig> and o157:h <dig> microarray studies  <cit>  and other genome analysis techniques such as wgpcr scanning  <cit> . cgh shows promise as a method that can not only verify the existence of the lineages and categorize strains into subtypes, but also of providing insight into specific genetic differences that could be related to differences in their ecology and evolution. the  <dig> vap orfs that were differentially distributed between the two obgs lineages were of particular interest in this study, since these orfs likely confer to strains possessing them the unique ecological or virulence characteristics associated with these lineages.

these  <dig> lineage-divergent vap orfs were clustered within several chromosomal regions, many of which were associated within e. coli o157:h <dig> sakai and edl <dig> s-loops and ois.

prophage were originally suspected as either causing or at least correlating with divergence of the genomes in lineage i and lineage ii strains  <cit>  and other studies have shown that prophage regions of the genome are highly polymorphic in different o157:h <dig> strains  <cit> . it is therefore not surprising that many of the vaps occur within prophage segments because these elements have significant homology to other prophages in the genome, making them hotspots for recombination. moreover, these regions of the genome also are topologically distinct. the results of distribution mapping of the lineage-specific vaps  also implies bias, suggesting that genome symmetry may be superimposed onto homology and topology as driving forces shaping the genome during divergence of the two lineages. when combined with the fact that some of the genes present in the affected prophage or pathogenicity islands could influence expression of virulence genes , it seems reasonable to conclude that multiple evolutionary forces may be working on these genome segments.

for many of these divergent regions, a bias in pt was also evident. divergent orfs identified in s-loops  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> and in sp <dig>  were absent in all lineage ii strains. similarly, lineage i pt <dig> strains and lineage ii strains also lacked the same orfs in s-loop# <dig>  lineage i/ii strains were all of the same lspa type,  <dig>  and of pt  <dig> and formed a distinct cluster in a dendrogram based on the pearson correlation analysis of microarray data for all  <dig> e. coli o157:h <dig> strains . pt <dig> was the most common pt of lineage ii strains included in this study. all pt <dig> strains from canada grouped together within the lineage ii cluster on this dendrogram, despite different isolation dates, host origins, and geographic origin within canada. in contrast to the apparent clonality of pt <dig>  pt <dig>  and pt <dig> strains, strains of pt <dig>  the predominant lineage i pt, were highly divergent on this dendrogram and some pt <dig> strains appeared to be closely related to other pts, such as pt <dig>  pt <dig>  and pt <dig>  these results suggest that there is a relationship between genomotype and lineage and between genomotype and some pts for e. coli o157:h <dig> strains, however, a larger number of strains from different geographical regions need to be examined to verify these relationships.

the lineage, lspa type and pt-specific and lineage, lspa type or pt-dominant vap orfs identified in this study were associated with several known or suspected virulence genes, including regions of divergence within s-loop  <dig>  which encodes stx <dig>  a number of studies have shown divergence in the structure of prophages encoding stx genes in e. coli o157:h <dig>  their insertion sites within the genome, and the type and level of toxin produced  <cit> . in addition to this, the absence of the non-lee encoded effector genes nleh1- <dig> and nlef and the perc homologue gene pchd in lineage ii strains are likely to affect their phenotype. however, further study is required to determine the precise role of these differences in the genomes e. coli o157:h <dig> lineage i and lineage ii strains on their ecology and virulence.

CONCLUSIONS
cgh was used to evaluate genomic variability within a collection of  <dig> e. coli o157:h <dig> strains. a total of  <dig> orfs were detected in all of the strains, suggesting that they represent core genes conserved in all e. coli o157:h <dig> strains. among the  <dig> vap orfs were clusters of orfs associated with bacteriophages and other genetically mobile elements. several clusters of orfs were lineage-specific or dominant. a number of the genes within lineage-specific or dominant orf clusters have been associated with virulence in e. coli o157:h <dig>  nucleotide sequencing of lineage-specific or dominant regions in the lineage ii e. coli frik  <dig> confirmed that the alterations in the genome detected by cgh are the results of genomic deletions or insertions. the genomic composition of these strains within lineages and subgroups suggests that both genomic divergence from an ancestral form and the lateral transfer of gene clusters have contributed to their evolution.
