BACKGROUND
advances in sequencing technologies have led to the explosion of large-scale sequencing projects: as of january  <dig>   <dig> bacterial genomes have been successfully sequenced, with other  <dig> genomes either unfinished or in assembly phases . since sequencing is no longer an issue, the real challenge is understanding how dna sequence leads to the specific phenotype of an organism. a key step in this process is the annotation of genes encoding proteins that contribute to particular functions. since the completion of the first bacterial genome in  <dig>  this process is usually carried out automatically using ab initio, homology, or combination approaches  <cit> . most gene structures are based on computational predictions  <cit> , and annotation is based on homology. however, automated annotation can be incorrect when sequence similarity is not associated with functional similarity, or when reference databases contain incorrect annotations, a problem that is estimated to afflict up to 49% of genes in public databases  <cit> . gene function is originally assigned where there is homology with related genes whose activity has been determined experimentally. however, second and third generation annotations, as well as associated errors, are prevalent.

experimental information related to protein function is necessary, but far more difficult to obtain at a whole genome level. genes must be informatically identified before they can be cloned, expressed, and tested for function, and the study of a whole recombinant proteome relies on the cloning of all open reading frames  in a genome. these “orfeome” collections, as they are termed, require huge efforts in terms of time and resources. once cloned, recombinatorial cloning systems allow relatively straightforward transfer between different vectors for genome scale projects  <cit> . however, even after correct gene identification and cloning, challenges are still present in terms of full-length protein expression and purification, with as few as 30% of proteins expressed solubly in e. coli at sufficient levels to be experimentally useful  <cit> .

functional annotation would be greatly facilitated if genomic dna could be used directly without the need to create orfeome resources. the fact that proteins generally contain multiple domains, each of which contributes to a distinct function, provides a potential mechanism by which this can be carried out. once generated, a protein domain library will be useful for many purposes. applications such as structural studies, antibody generation, protein/substrate binding analyses, domain shuffling for enzyme evolution and protein chips will all benefit from a library of well folded protein domains.

an analysis of the length distribution of protein domains  <cit> , reveals that most range from  <dig> to  <dig> aa, with a peak at around  <dig> aa: we speculate that fragmenting a whole  genome into dna fragments of 200- <dig> bp, should provide a broad representation of all the protein domains from a single species, a polypeptide population that has been termed the “domainome”  <cit> . the availability of genome sequences, coupled with the ability to experimentally determine the function of a domain, rather than a full-length protein, could also provide a simpler method to annotate genes on the basis of specific function.

in order to develop a gene annotation method based on the function of individual domains on a genomic scale, a random approach is required in order to avoid bias towards what is already known. in this perspective, randomly fragmented genomic dna represents a good dna source for intronless organisms. unfortunately, the use of randomly generated dna fragments suffers from several problems: i) non orfs  and non genic orfs ), can be obtained for fragments derived from random fragmentation. these non genic orfs will translate into polypeptides with no biological meaning; ii) folding failure occurs even for correctly identified and cloned orfs, thus impairing their function; iii) proteins or protein fragments which fold in different cellular compartments can be affected by recombinant expression in inappropriate redox, or chaperone, environments.

to address these issues, we demonstrate  <cit> , with others  <cit> , that folding reporters could be very useful tools. the principle under which they operate is that a poorly folded test protein can adversely affect the folding of a “reporter” protein to which it is fused, by trapping it in a non-functional or aggregated state. moreover, when the folding reporter has an easily identifiable phenotype , rescuing those clones expressing properly folded and soluble orfs becomes a relatively straightforward process.

while it might be expected that any orf  would confer the positively selectable phenotype , we recently observed that when cdna fragments are cloned upstream of the folding reporter, a selection for fragments from real genes tends to occur  <cit> , and when a plasmid containing four known genes was fragmented and placed upstream of a folding reporter, over 80% of selected dna fragments were genic orfs  <cit> .

the folding reporter we used in this work is the tem- <dig> β-lactamase. this enzyme confers ampicillin resistance to bacteria only when exported into the periplasmic space, a process that relies on the presence of a secretion leader at the n-terminus of the enzyme. in our system, dna fragments are cloned between the secretion leader and the β-lactamase gene , so that only those fragments that are able to fold coherently, and are in frame with both components, allow correct folding of the enzyme and its subsequent export into the periplasm. moreover, the double fusion ensures that small fragments containing cryptic start sites cannot be positively selected, as they lack the leader sequence, resulting in an increase in the stringency of selection. this is in contrast to other folding reporter models  <cit> , in which fragments are cloned upstream of the reporter gene alone. as m <dig> phages assemble in the periplasm, a protein domain library translocated into the periplasm is also suitable for m <dig> based phage display, providing appropriate vectors  <cit>  are available. this allows domainome libraries to be directly selected for gene fragments encoding domains with specific binding properties or even enzyme activities, if compatible activity based probes  <cit>  are available.

proper folding of a polypeptide depends both on the amino acid composition and extrinsic factors, such as chaperones and redox conditions. consequently correct folding depends upon a protein folding in the appropriate cellular compartment.

in bacteria, most proteins cross the inner membrane by means of the type ii secretory system. this comprises three different pathways  <cit> : the sec-dependent pathway , the signal recognition particle , and the twin-arginine translocation  pathways. while the sec pathway exports unfolded proteins, the srp and tat pathways export co- and post-translationally folded proteins, respectively. in this paper, we show how the use of three different β-lactamase filtering vectors, each exploiting one of the different export systems, allows broader representation of domains that can be filtered from a genome.

in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the filtering method applied at the whole genome level, we chose clostridium thermocellum as model organism. the general interest in this anaerobic bacterium relies on its extraordinary ability to metabolize plant cell wall polysaccharides by means of a complex secreted multiprotein complex. its components have a typical multidomain structure where each domain has a defined function   <cit> . indeed, the fact that its genome has been recently sequenced , but not completely annotated makes it a good candidate for domain-based functional annotation purposes.

in this paper we describe the preparation and characteristics of filtered domain libraries prepared from genomic dna, using libraries created from the c. thermocellum genome as a model system.

RESULTS
construction of c. thermocellum dna libraries and orf filtering
due to the relatively high amount of starting material required to generate a genomic library, c. thermocellum genomic dna  was used as a template for multiple displacement amplification  in order to obtain 10- <dig> µg of dna for subsequent fragmentation. fragmentation was carried out using nebulisation, and conditions were optimized to obtain a fragment distribution in the range of 200- <dig> bp. such a length range was intended to be optimal for the statistical representation of all the domains in the genome. gdna was cloned as blunt end fragments into three filtering vectors, in which an ecorv cloning site was found between a sec , srp  or tat  leader sequence and the mature ß lactamase. the three final vectors, carrying the chloramphenicol resistance gene as a selective marker, have the sv <dig> and 6xhis tags downstream of the cloned gdna fragment . the effect of growing clones containing the gdna library on different concentrations of ampicillin is depicted in figure  <dig>  panel b: only gdna fragments that are in frame with both secretion leader and β-lactamase gene  can survive the selective pressure of higher ampicillin concentrations. among surviving clones, those that encode well-folding fragments would be expected to survive at higher ampicillin concentrations, as they would be expected to allow greater amounts of functional β-lactamase to accumulate.

fragment length was provisionally assessed by pcr analysis of random clones, and the average length determined to be around  <dig> bp. considering the starting diversity of the non-filtered libraries , a statistical coverage of  <dig> to  <dig> fold of the  <dig>  mb genome was obtained. with such coverage, we expected that, after orf filtration the final library diversity would have remained sufficient to represent all c. thermocellum genes.

approximately  <dig> bacterial cells for each library were plated on chloramphenicol plates, supplemented with increasing ampicillin concentrations . after overnight growth at 30°c, the number of surviving cells was evaluated with data shown in figure  <dig>  the sec and srp libraries show similar behaviour, with a dramatic drop off at  <dig>  µg/ml ampicillin, while the tat library has a more gentle decrease in survival rate, with a first drop at  <dig>  µg/ml, and a second one at  <dig>  µg/ml, when survival seems comparable to the other two libraries. the ampicillin concentration at which 1% of clones survive is different for the three libraries. the sec leader provides the greatest resistance, requiring ~ <dig> µg/ml, the srp leader requires  <dig> µg/ml, and the tat leader is the most sensitive, with  <dig>  µg/ml ampicillin being sufficient to eliminate over  <dig> % of colonies.

β-lactamase functional assay on filtered libraries
in order to confirm the hypothesis that some colonies can survive at higher ampicillin concentration because a greater amount of soluble and functional β-lactamase fusion protein is produced, we tested the β-lactamase activity of random clones grown on agar plates containing different concentrations of ampicillin.

forty-five to  <dig> clones for each library were picked from chloramphenicol plates  and from plates with  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> µg/ml ampicillin; culture supernatants of induced clones were tested for activity on nitrocefin, a chromogenic substrate containing a β-lactam ring that is hydrolyzed by β-lactamase. the activity was measured as an increase in the absorbance at different time-points; positive and negative controls were also included. as shown in figure  <dig>  the average activity of clones in each of the three libraries increased with the increasing selective pressure provided by increasing ampicillin concentrations. additional file  <dig> shows the clones tested for the tat library. pictures of plates  and corresponding absorbance measurements  were taken at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h. the data show that most of the clones surviving at  <dig>  µg/ml and higher ampicillin concentrations are actually orfs, since all of them have β-lactamase activity at  <dig> h; interestingly, clones surviving at higher ampicillin concentrations  already have higher activity at  <dig> h incubation, while signals from clones surviving at  <dig> - <dig> µg/ml rise more slowly. this is an indication that the activity is enhanced for clones surviving at higher ampicillin concentration: this finding is best interpreted as indicating that a higher expression of correctly folded, active and soluble fusion enzyme is produced at the higher ampicillin concentrations.

deep sequencing of filtered libraries
surviving bacteria were rescued from the different filtering plates and plasmid dna obtained for each sample. we chose to sequence the samples with a survival rate of approximately 1%, reasoning that this should identify clones encoding domains that are relatively well folded. inserts from filtered libraries were cleaved by restriction enzymes and subjected to roche  <dig> flx titanium sequencing. sequences were aligned to the reference c. thermocellum genome and 96%  of annotated protein coding genes were identified by at least one read . the venn diagram in figure  <dig> shows the distribution of the mapped genes, with a significant portion of genes represented in only one of the libraries, thus sustaining the hypothesis that, by using  <dig> vectors with different leaders, domain representation is increased. figure  <dig>  panel a, shows the general distribution of reads along c. thermocellum genome, indicating approximate even representation of the entire genome, with only one region showing a significant over-representation. furthermore, careful examination of figure 5a reveals a number of regions where the three libraries show different percentage representations. interestingly, the sec library gave the highest coverage, despite the lower number of sequences obtained. a total of  <dig> reads were obtained for the sec filtered library, with  <dig> genes mapped by at least one read.

as  <dig> sequencing normally introduces errors  <cit> , it was impossible to accurately determine the percentages of genic or non genic orfs that were filtered. in order to overcome this, we increased the stringency of the sequence analysis by creating a data set of “perfect sequences” with no sequencing errors and 100% match to the genome reference sequence . this procedure led to the identification of a data set of  <dig> perfect sequences, with the same distribution pattern as the general sec library , thus indicating that no bias was introduced when increasing the stringency of the sequence analysis. within the “perfect match” set of sequences, the reading frame could be correctly and unambiguously assigned :  <dig>  % of reads corresponded to genic open reading frames, a much higher percentage than the expected  <dig> % . these data indicate that β-lactamase acts as a folding reporter, thus pushing the selection towards orfs with biological meaning.

a more detailed analysis of a number of genes covered by multiple clones showed that sequences with different lengths were evenly distributed along the genes. in figure  <dig>  an example is given for filtered sequences mapping to cthe_ <dig>  as can be seen, much of the gene is covered by sequences, and some of these overlap in what appear to be potential domains. the true coverage is likely to be significantly higher, since we were only able to sequence a small proportion of the complete filtered library size.

discussion
in a previous paper  <cit>  we fragmented a plasmid containing four genes , and used the ß lactamase approach described here to “filter” out putative open reading frames. we discovered that all filtered clones were open reading frames and 84% of these were derived from real genes, as opposed to random open reading frames. in the work described here, we have extended these results to the analysis of a full genome. this was carried out in two parts. in the first part the genome coverage for each of the three libraries  was assessed using the obtained sequences. the results in figure  <dig> showed that almost all of the annotated genes in c. thermocellum were represented by at least one read in the library. furthermore, the use of different leaders increased the genome coverage. most genes  were found in all three libraries. the sec leader provided the greatest number of different genes , and the addition of the tat and srp leaders provided an additional  <dig>  different genes, for a total of 96% of all genes, or almost complete genome coverage. the goal of the second analysis was to determine the percentage of open reading frames, and where they were derived from. given the tendency of  <dig> sequencing to introduce errors  <cit> , it was impossible to carry this out with the raw  <dig> sequences. this was overcome by compiling a set of “perfect sequences” that had a 100% match to the genome sequence at both ends, allowing us to determine the precise start and end of each clone. perfect sequence sets were generated from the sec library filtered to a survival level of 1%. these revealed that  <dig>  % were open reading frames with no stop codons, of which  <dig>  % were derived from genic orfs, as opposed to spurious orfs, of no biological significance. we hypothesize that real gene or mrna fragments encode polypeptides that naturally evolved to fold correctly, thus driving the proper folding and activity of the folding reporter, while random orfs generate peptides with no biological meaning that are more likely to negatively affect the folding, aggregation state or activity of the reporter.

in our sequencing experiments, we analyzed those clones corresponding to a survival of 1%. we reasoned that this would represent a balance between broad genome representation and the selection for clones encoding well folding domains. figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig> show clearly that the greater the concentration of ampicillin used for filtering, the higher the activity of ß-lactamase, as determined by the nitrocefin colorometric assay. although we have not formally shown that domains fused to ß-lactamase with higher activity are better folded, similar experiments using gfp  as a folding reporter  <cit> , in which proteins of interest are fused upstream of gfp and selected on the basis of clone fluorescence, have clearly demonstrated that clone fluorescence is directly proportional to the folding and solubility of the fused protein of interest when not fused to gfp. in these experiments, gfp can be considered to be analogous to the ß-lactamase, in that correct functioning of the reporter is dependent upon the folding and solubility state of the fused domain. the technology described here is genome neutral and can be used to rapidly create a domainome library from any intronless genome, or collection of open reading frames of interest. the use of the random approach described here avoids the need for extensive analysis, primer synthesis or multiple pcrs, and creates a resource in which many different versions of each domain, differing by a few amino acids, are created. once generated, it is expected that the protein fragments obtained by this approach will be useful for many purposes, including structural studies, antibody generation, protein/substrate binding analyses, domain shuffling for enzyme evolution and protein chips. furthermore, once recloned into a phage display context, domainome libraries can be directly selected for gene fragments encoding domains with specific binding properties  or enzyme activities, if appropriate activity based probes are available  <cit>  <dig> <cit>  <cit>  <dig> <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
with this work we demonstrated that domainome libraries can be easily generated by applying β-lactamase based filtering to randomly fragmented bacterial gdna libraries. once a library is generated, it can be used as a universal reagent to be screened for several activities. the identification of domains showing specific activity, instead of the testing of single genes, will allow functional annotation of the domains themselves: this annotation represents the first step to the high throughput assignment of full length gene products to structural functions or to specific metabolic pathways.
