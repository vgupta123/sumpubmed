BACKGROUND
micrornas  are 19- <dig> nucleotide long non-coding rnas that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, either by endonucleolytic cleavage or by translational inhibition  <cit> . increasing evidence indicates that mirnas play major roles in key aspects of plant development and their response to environmental stresses  <cit> . the fact that a large number of the known mirnas in the plant kingdom from mosses and ferns to higher flowering plants are evolutionarily conserved has been used as a practical indicator for identification or prediction of mirnas by homology searches in other species  <cit> . mirnas predicted by bioinformatics should be validated for their expression by experimental methods. northern blotting and pcr based amplification of adaptor-ligated cdna have been used for validation of predicted mirnas  <cit> . northern blotting might not be sensitive enough to detect less-abundant mirnas and it does not reveal the actual mirna sequences while pcr-based amplification can be difficult in practice when the actual mature mirna region is unknown. recently developed next-generation high throughput sequencing technologies provide a powerful strategy to identify as well as quantify mirnas. these technologies open up possibilities of exploring srna populations in economically important species that lack adequate genome information, such as trifoliate orange .

increasing evidence shows that the mirna repertoire of any plant or animal species comprises of a set of conserved ancient mirnas as well as many recently evolved species-specific mirnas  <cit> . since the species-specific mirnas often accumulate at lower levels than conserved ancient mirnas, it is sometimes difficult to assess them when derived from traditional sequencing approaches such as the sanger sequencing method which has been widely used in model plant species with known genome sequences e.g arabidopsis, poplar, and rice  <cit> . the availability of next generation sequencing technologies provide high throughput tools to make new discoveries of additional species-specific or lowly expressed mirnas, e.g. in arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit> , poplar  <cit> , triticum aestivum  <cit> , zea mays  <cit> , medicago tuncatula  <cit> , lycopersicon esculentum  <cit> , gossypium hirsutum  <cit> , and taxus chinensis  <cit> . with the availability of high throughput sequencing technology, like the  <dig> technology, solexa platform, and massively parallel sequencing , it may be possible to make new discoveries of species specific or lowly expressed mirnas. however, there still exist some differences between these novel sequencing technologies. it is reported that the longest reads can be obtained using  <dig> technology, while the solexa platform can yield a higher number of reads  <cit> , and is fit for sequencing of shorter reads   <cit> . although mpss can also give a huge number of reads, it gives even shorter reads i.e only  <dig> bp  <cit>  that are shorter than that of mirnas. since the mirnas sequences are only about  <dig> nt in length, the solexa platform seems to be the preferable choice for mirna discovery.

citrus is one of the most economically important evergreen fruit crop in the world. citrus trifoliata  has consistently been one of the most important rootstock species used in the citrus industry, and has even been used as a model species for citrus molecular biology and genomic studies. the availability of a large number of expressed sequence tags  from c. trifoliata is also an excellent source of experimental material for elucidation of gene expression and regulation. although mirnas have been extensively studied in the past five years, limited systematic study of mirnas has been performed on the citrus genus and especially c. trifoliata. sequencing of all expressed srnas is required for complete identification of conserved mirnas in c. trifoliata.

identification of several mirnas from citrus by computational approaches  <cit>  and the verification of conserved citrus mirna by homology to arabidopsis have been reported  <cit> . however, the number of predicted c. trifoliata mirnas still remains quite low. recent mirna analysis in arabidopsis and rice using the deep sequencing approach discovered that the encoding loci of non-conserved mirnas were more than that of conserved mirnas  <cit> . therefore, it was necessary to carry out further research on the mirnas in c. trifoliata, and deep sequencing as a method was given preference.

to investigate the role of mirnas during reproductive growth, high throughput sequencing technology  was employed to survey srna populations from c. trifoliata flower buds, flowers and fruits at different development stages. in this study, a total of  <dig> , <dig> srnas representing  <dig> , <dig> unique srnas were sequenced. based on sequence similarity and hairpin structure prediction, we found that  <dig>  reads representing  <dig> sequences from  <dig> highly conserved mirna families, have perfect matches to known mirnas. our results indicate that a complex and diverse srna population exists in c. trifoliata. based on the identified mirna and some mirna* sequences,  <dig> conversed mirna  precursors have been identified from the citrus est library  <cit> . through deep sequencing we also identified ten species-specific mirnas whose precursors were all potentially generated from  <dig>  citrus ests, of which five mirna* sequences were also sequenced. furthermore, we studied expression patterns of the  <dig> novel mirna candidates by qrt-pcr in different tissues of c. trifoliata. potential target genes were predicted for most conserved and novel mirnas, of which four target genes including one irx <dig> encoding copper ion binding/oxidoreductase and three genes encoding nb-lrr disease resistance protein have been experimentally verified by detection of the mirna-mediated mrna cleavage in c. trifoliata.

RESULTS
c. trifoliata has a complex srna population
to identify mirnas involved in development of the citrus rootstock, c. trifoliata, a separate srna library was generated from the earlier mentioned reproductive tissues. the library was sequenced by solexa , yielding a total of  <dig> , <dig> srna raw reads with lengths of  <dig> to 30nt and consisting of  <dig> , <dig> unique sequences . after further removal of trnas , rrnas , snrnas , snornas , exon rna , intron sense , and repeat region , a total of  <dig> , <dig> srna sequences were obtained. although some srnas were highly abundant and present thousands of times in our dataset, majority of srnas were sequenced only a few times. for example,  <dig> , <dig> out of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> srnas were sequenced only once. the results show that  the expression of different srnas in trifoliate orange varies drastically and  survey of srna is far from being exhausted in the trifoliate orange. this also suggests that trifoliate orange contains a large and diverse srna population. compared to equivalent studies from other plants , the quantity of srnas acquired from c. trifoliata is at least  <dig> times more, which might be due to the difference of depth of the sequencing effort, the genome size of the plants, or the development stages of the samples collected in the different sequencing projects.

the size distribution of all srnas is as summarized in figure 1a. the length of the trifoliate orange srnas varied from  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt, and the majority of them  were in the range from  <dig> to  <dig> nt in length with  <dig>  and  <dig>  nt ones as the two major size classes . this result was consistent with those of arabidopsis  <cit> , medicago truncatula  <cit> , and oryza sativa  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the  <dig> nt srnas even accounted to about 60% of its srna transcriptome  <cit> . however, the trifoliate orange srna size distribution differed from those of wheat and conifer obtained through  <dig> high throughput sequencing  <cit>  and from taxus chinensis ones obtained through solexa sequencing  <cit> . to further compare the average abundance of srnas with different lengths, we measured the ratio of raw and unique sequences. srnas varied widely in length, and there is variation in redundancies of them, among which the srnas class with  <dig> and  <dig> nt showed the highest redundancies . the average ratio of redundant and unique sequences of srnas with different sizes showed no obvious changes. although the srnas annotated as mirnas in the sizes of  <dig> nt,  <dig> nt,  <dig> nt, and  <dig> nt all had about 96- <dig> unique reads, their redundant reads surprisingly varied widely especially for the  <dig> nt group  which had  <dig>  redundant reads and occupied almost 73% of the srnas assigned to mirna therefore indicating that  <dig> nt long srnas are the most outstanding mirna.

identifying conserved mirnas in c. trifoliata
to identify the conserved mirnas from the c. trifoliata, srna sequences identified from c. trifoliata by deep sequencing were compared with the currently known mature plant mirnas in mirbase  <cit> . after blastn searches and further sequence analysis, a total of  <dig> conserved mirnas, belonging to  <dig> mirna families, were identified in c. trifoliate.  <dig> mirna* of these mirnas were also sequenced . the most of the identified mirna families have been shown to be conserved in a variety of plant species using a comparative genomics-based strategy. for example, mir <dig>  mir156/ <dig>  mir <dig>  mir165/ <dig>  and mir <dig> have been found in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> plant species, respectively  <cit> . there is only one member identified in the majority of mirna families, whereas some mirna families contained many potential members  that need some further validation based on genomic or est sequences.

it has been demonstrated that high throughput sequencing can provide an alternative way to estimate the expression profiles of mirna genes  <cit>  and allow us to determine the abundance of various mirna families and even distinguish between different members of a given family of one organism. the highly expressed mirna will likely have a large number of sequenced clones. among the  <dig> mirna families, the mir <dig> family had the most reads, accounting for  <dig> % of the conserved mirna reads. additionally, fifteen mirna families namely mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  were found to have some thousands to tens of thousands of redundancies while four families , had more than one hundred redundancies. the remaining families were infrequently sequenced . in this study, we have tried to identify the precursor sequences for the  <dig> conserved c. trifoliata mirnas, and only  <dig> pre-mirnas and their secondary structures have been identified from the available citrus est databases  <cit> .

identifying novel potential mirnas in c. trifoliata
since the whole genomic sequence of c. trifoliata is unavailable, unique srna sequences were mapped to est sequences restored in ncbi using c. trifoliata, as well as the other citrus species. by searching all c. trifoliata srnas against ests and predicting the secondary structures of a series of sequences surrounding them , we identified  <dig> sequences that satisfied the secondary structure criteria as established by zhang et al.  <cit>  and shown in table  <dig> with all the sequences meeting the new criteria of mirna annotation  <cit> . five of these putative mirnas i.e. 50% were supported by mirna*. based on their near perfect secondary structure and following recent mirna annotation criteria, these mirnas were considered novel mirnas  <cit> . although not all were supported by mirna*s, the novel c. trifoliata-specific mirnas generally have a significant number of reads in the small library. similar to conserved mirnas,  <dig> of the  <dig> novel mirnas begin with a 5' uridine, which is a characteristic feature of mirnas . the expression of the  <dig> mirnas was assayed using qrt-pcr analysis and signals were detected for all of them . mirnas specific to c. trifoliata exhibited different tissue-specific expression patterns. for example, ctr-mirn <dig> was found to be specifically expressed in fruit tissue, whereas ctr-mirn <dig>  which targeted nb-lrr gene , was expressed in all the tissues assayed .

detection and expression patterns of novel potential mirnas in c. trifoliata
preferential expression of novel mirnas in specific tissues might provide clues about the physiological function of these mirnas. qrt-pcr is a reliable method for detecting and measuring the expression levels of mirnas. in this study, we adopted this technique to validate and measure the expression of  <dig> novel potential mirnas . all of these potential mirnas were identified in c. trifoliata by solexa sequencing. to aid in determination of c. trifoliata novel mirna functions, we examined their expression in different organs  by qrt-pcr analysis of lmw-rna samples from various tissues of trifoliate orange trees. the data obtained can form powerful evidence to support the existence of the novel mirnas in c. trifoliata. the expression patterns of most novel mirnas in c. trifoliata appear to be tissue or development stage specific, with all the expression patterns of these mirnas in citrus being grouped into several situations. the expression patterns of ctr-mirn <dig> and ctr-mirn <dig> were similar and revealed to be specifically expressed in c. trifoliata fruit tissue  as shown in figure 4a and 4h. however, ctr-mirn <dig> displayed different expression patterns in various organs and development stages where there was high expression in leaves of  <dig> cm diameter, weaker expression in leaves of  <dig>  cm diameter and no expression in leaves of  <dig>  cm diameter. furthermore, ctr-mirn <dig> had different expression patterns in stem, flower, and fruits. it seems that ctr-mirn <dig> becomes strongly expressed as different tissues age. some of the mirnas might display species-specific and/or developmental stage-specific expression patterns, as exemplified by ctr-mirn <dig>  ctr-mirn <dig> and ctr-mirn <dig> . ctr-mirn <dig> had preferential expression only in open flowers, while ctr-mirn <dig> had strong expression in leaves of  <dig>  cm in diameter and weak expression in developing flower bud. ctr-mirn <dig> was expressed only in flowers at different development stages , while ctr-mirn <dig> seemed to be expressed strongly in old stems, moderately in leaves of  <dig>  cm in diameter and weakly in roots of trifoliate orange . ctr-mirn <dig> was expressed in all tissues tested with the highest expression level in fruits of  <dig> cm in diameter and relatively strong expression in flower buds . ctr-mirn <dig> was expressed in all tissues tested except in root and young stem, with at highest expression level in flower and relatively strong expression in leaves of  <dig> cm in diameter . ctr-mirn <dig> was expressed in most of tissues except in leaves of  <dig>  cm diameter. specifically, ctr-mirn <dig> had strong expression in flowers at different stages and moderate expression in fruits of different sizes .

in summary,  <dig> novel potential mirnas, all identified by solexa sequencing, were validated by qrt-pcr with some being expressed ubiquitously in all tissues with tissue, species, and/or growth stage specific characteristics reflected at different expression levels.

prediction of the c. trifoliata mirna target genes
to better understand the functions of the newly identified species-specific as well as conserved c. trifoliata mirnas, putative targets of these mirnas were predicted using the described criteria and methods. we predicted target genes, and putative targets were identified for  <dig> out of  <dig> conserved families . we also found homologs of known mirna target genes for several conserved c. trifoliata mirnas, such as sbp for mir <dig>  atp synthase for mir <dig>  arf for mir <dig>  nac for mir <dig>  hd-zip for mir <dig> and mir <dig>  anthocyanidin synthase for mir <dig>  gras for mir <dig>  ap <dig> for mir <dig>  tcp for mir <dig>  tir for mir <dig>  f-box for mir <dig>  sulfate transporter  <dig>  for mir <dig>  irx <dig> copper ion binding/oxidoreductase for mir <dig>  argonaute  <dig> for mir <dig>  basic blue copper protein for mir <dig> and zinc finger protein-related for mir <dig>  additionally, we predicted a few genes with unknown function and hypothetical genes for mirna targeting . careful analysis of these potential targets will contribute to our understanding of the role of mirnas in fruit trees. no targets were found in c. trifoliata for mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> 

using the criteria used by song et al.  <cit> , targets were predicted for  <dig> of these novel mirnas. it has been confirmed that mir <dig> targets the mrna coding for apetala2-like transcription factors, an important gene known for controlling flower development  <cit> . the important targets included nb-lrr disease resistance gene analogs, such as uc46- <dig> and uc46- <dig> that were found to be similar to populus trichocarpa xm_ <dig> cc-nbs-lrr resistance protein and uc46- <dig> that was similar to p. trichocarpa xm_ <dig> cc-nbs-lrr resistance protein.

identification of mirna-guided cleavage of target mrnas in c. trifoliata
most arabidopsis mirnas have been shown to guide cleavage of their target genes  <cit> . to verify the nature of the potential mirna targets and to study how the mirnas in c. trifoliata regulate their target genes, a modified rlm-race experiment was set up, as described in the materials and methods section. in this study, the rlm-race procedure was successfully used to map the cleavage sites in four predicted target genes of c. trifoliata. given the clear tissue-specific pattern of expression of ctr-mir <dig>  ctr-mirn <dig>  ctr-mirn <dig> and ctr-mirn <dig> in all types of vegetative organs of trifoliate orange , these analyses were performed on a few of their putative targets, using rna extracted from leaves, stems, roots, flowers, and fruits of trifoliate orange, where ctr-mir <dig>  ctr-mirn <dig>  ctr-mirn <dig> and ctr-mirn <dig> were all abundantly expressed. uc46- <dig>  uc46- <dig>  uc46- <dig>  and uc46- <dig> were confirmed as the real targets of ctr-mir <dig>  ctr-mirn <dig>  ctr-mirn <dig> and ctr-mirn <dig> respectively, since all the 5'ends of the mrna fragments were mapped to the nucleotide that pairs to the tenth nucleotide of each mirna with higher frequencies than depicted for each pairing oligo . all four predicted targets were found to have specific cleavage sites corresponding to the mirna complementary sequences  and might be regulated by the four mirnas in the style of small interfering rnas  directing the cleavage of mrna targets  <cit> . uc46- <dig> is similar to arabidopsis proteins coded by irx <dig> copper ion binding/oxidoreductase  , while uc46- <dig>  uc46- <dig> and uc46- <dig> all coded for a protein highly homologous to nb-lrr disease resistance protein .

discussion
c. trifoliata conserved mirnas
although many mirnas had been identified by traditional sanger sequencing or computational approaches  <cit> , most species-specific mirnas are still unidentified. this is because traditional sequencing methods tend to generate a relatively small number of sequences while the plant species-specific mirnas are often present at a lower level than the conserved mirnas  <cit> . thousands of plant mirna genes have been annotated and some of them have been well characterized  <cit> . however, most plant mirnas appears to be the conserved ones and many other functional mirnas in plant species remain to be investigated. compared to annotated mirnas from arabidopsis and rice, much fewer mirnas from c. trifoliata plants have been identified. recently, several studies performed in silico identification of mirnas from citrus  <cit>  and about  <dig> conserved mirna families were detected, which is still not of a large number of the citrus mirnas. pursuing new sequencing technology can be good choice for the discovery of more mirnas in citrus. solexa deep sequencing platform is an ideal choice for mirna discovery, and the sequencing results in this study showed its capability in that no complete genome is available. as to the mirnas computationally predicted, most of them could also be discovered by this deep sequencing, except two of them   <cit> . it might be due to the spatiotemporal expression and depth of sequencing that mir <dig> and mir <dig> could not be sequenced. deep sequencing can provide us the precise sequences of the mirnas in an organism. the mirnas sequenced in this study can definitely provide the information of c. trifoliate mirnas for further study on their gene regulation function, the evolution and biogenesis of them.

novel mirnas in c. trifoliata
besides the conserved mirnas, we also report  <dig> novel mirnas by deep sequencing. although the c. trifoliata full genome sequence is not available, the large number of citrus expressed sequence tags is an excellent source for precursor identification. based on blastn search and hairpin structure prediction, we found potential precursors for all the  <dig> novel mirnas. because these  <dig> mirnas were not similar to any known conserved mirnas, and were predicted from citrus ests, then they might be specific to citrus and could play more species-specific roles. prediction of these novel mirnas involves the identification of stem-loop structure of the potential pre-mirnas and sequencing of the mirna* molecules  <cit> . all the  <dig> novel non conserved potential mirnas more,  <dig> of these mirna* yielded more than one read. in this study, qrt-pcr was found to be a reliable method for detecting and measuring the expression levels of mirnas. we adopted this technique to validate and measure the expression of  <dig> novel mirnas in trifoliate orange tissues . all of these novel mirnas were identified in trifoliate orange by solexa sequencing. the qrt-pcr results demonstrate that most tested novel mirnas were expressed with tissue-, species-, and/or growth-stage-specific characteristics, while a few were expressed ubiquitously in all tissues. moreover our qrt-pcr results can not only validate the mirna prediction in c. trifoliata, but also show that their preferential expression can provide important clues about where these mirnas function. however, more studies need to be performed to elucidate the functions that these novel mirnas have in the growth and development of trifoliate orange.

mirna target prediction
to assess and define a putative function for a mirna in plant, a further step of target identification is necessary. currently, the most efficient tool available for this is the bioinformatics approach facilitated by the high degree of homology between mirna and its target sequences in plants  <cit> . analysis of several targets has now confirmed this prediction, making it feasible to identify plant mirna targets  <cit> . we first searched candidate targets of the citrus mirnas and the putative mirnas by blast, and confirmed them by alignment with their orthologs in arabidopsis. our analysis reveals that most of the predicted targets in citrus have a conserved function with mirna targets in arabidopsis and these mirna target sequences are also highly conserved among a wide variety of plant species as reported by floyd and bowman  <cit> . consistent with previous reports, most of these targets in citrus were plant-specific transcription factors, such as ap <dig>  nac, sbp and the arf family.

a large number of plant mirna targets predicted bioinformatically have also been experimentally confirmed. even though mirnas generally function as negative regulators of gene expression by mediating the cleavage of target mrnas  <cit>  or by repressing their translation  <cit> , the cleavage of target mrnas appears to be the predominant mode of gene regulation by plant mirnas  <cit> . finding the cleavage site supposedly located in the sequence complementary to mirna in the target gene is necessary to verify the cleavage of target mrnas. among the methods used to observe mirna-dependent cleavage of targets, rlm-race is the most useful  <cit> . we performed the race on unigene to detect and clone the mrna fragment corresponding precisely to the predicted product of mirna processing. in total, we performed 5' race assays on four predicted target genes i.e. the representative targets of four conserved mirnas . uc46- <dig> is similar to arabidopsis proteins coded by irx <dig> copper ion binding/oxidoreductase  , while uc46- <dig>  uc46- <dig>  and uc46- <dig> all coded for a protein highly homologous to nb-lrr disease resistance protein. targeting of nb-lrr genes by mirnas has previously been reported in poplar  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit> , loblolly pine  <cit> , and grape  <cit> , but its contribution to disease resistance is still poorly characterized. in our study, all four predicted targets were found to have specific cleavage sites corresponding to the mirna complementary sequences , and the most common 5' end of the mrna fragments mapped to the nucleotides that pair with the 10th mirna nucleotide from the 5' ends. this validation was obtained by performing the modified 5' race protocol on mrna extracted from pooled tissues of leaf, stem, root, and flower where it had been previously demonstrated that ctr-mirn <dig>  ctr-mirn <dig>  and ctr-mirn <dig> are all abundant . mirnas may directly target transcription factors that affect plant development and also specific genes that control metabolism. in our study, it appears that our predicted targets play roles not only in development, but also in diverse physiological processes.

CONCLUSIONS
for the first time we discovered through high through-put solexa sequencing of short rnas from c. trifoliata flowers and fruits  <dig> new potential mirnas and  <dig> highly conserved mirna families, indicating that specific mirnas exist in citrus species. these results show that regulatory mirnas exist in agronomically important trifoliate orange and may play an important role in citrus growth, development, and response to disease.
