BACKGROUND
macrophomina phaseolina  goid. is a soil-borne deuteromycete fungal pathogen with a worldwide distribution and a host range that includes more than  <dig> crop and non-crop plant species  <cit> . the fungus is a generalist pathogen that attacks stressed plants at all stages of growth causing charcoal rot, seedling damping-off, and ashy stem blight diseases of major and minor crops  <cit> . major crops such as soybean, maize, and sorghum as well as some crops of economic importance such as common bean are all known hosts of the pathogen and disease incidence is often associated with high temperatures and drought stress. recently, there has been a worldwide increase in reports of incidence of the pathogen on diverse crop species  <cit> , which could reflect a wider appreciation of the importance of this disease to crop production in drought-prone regions.

in the arid sub-saharan region of west africa where cowpea is a crop of major economic importance for resource poor farmers, seedling damping-off and ashy stem blight diseases of cowpea caused by macrophomina result in significant yield losses  <cit> . cowpea is a major crop in this and other arid regions due, in part, to its comparatively high capacity to withstand drought stress and poor soil conditions  <cit> . the sub-saharan cowpea production region is characterized by high temperatures  and intermittent rainfall with periods of drought which favor disease development  <cit> . as a result, cowpea yields remain low  with macrophomina infection under drought stress being a major yield-suppressing factor in this agro-ecological zone.

the synergism between disease severity and drought stress is important in breeding programs which are developing drought tolerant cultivars. in cowpea, as in other crops, significant investments continue to be made in the genetic improvement of crop productivity under limited water conditions  <cit> . however, relatively little emphasis has been placed on the impact of macrophomina on elite drought-tolerant cultivars in breeding programs. in evaluations of drought-tolerant cowpea genotypes, ndiaye  <cit>  reported that they were all susceptible to macrophomina infection. with the exception of the stay-green trait in sorghum  <cit> , there are no reports of genetic overlap between drought tolerance and resistance to macrophomina.

host plant resistance-based management of macrophomina is a potential option for resource-poor farmers. however, in cowpea, only minor sources of resistance have been reported among a few genotypes evaluated in india  <cit>  and senegal  <cit> , and no studies have identified genomic regions involved in resistance against the pathogen. in other crops, potentially useful minor sources of resistance have been reported in sorghum  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , and common bean  <cit> . further, studies in common bean suggested that late-maturing varieties were more resistant to attack by macrophomina than early-maturing varieties  <cit> , and similar observations were made in soybean  <cit>  and sorghum  <cit> .

the purpose of this study was to evaluate the levels of resistance against macrophomina infection in a diverse set of fourteen cowpea genotypes as well as identifying and mapping quantitative trait loci  associated with resistance to macrophomina infection in a recombinant inbred line  population, it93k-503- <dig> × cb <dig>  we used a genetic map developed by merging an aflp-based map  <cit>  and an expressed sequence tag -derived single nucleotide polymorphism  marker-based map  <cit>  for the same population. a consensus genetic linkage map  <cit>  incorporating snp markers from the it93k-503- <dig> × cb <dig> map and five other ril populations was utilized for synteny-based candidate gene identification and definition of qtl locations on the cowpea map. since the it93k-503- <dig> × cb <dig> population was used previously to map qtl for the delayed drought-induced premature senescence and maturity-related senescence traits  <cit> , the extent of genetic overlap between drought tolerance, maturity, and macrophomina resistance loci in cowpea was also evaluated.

RESULTS
experimental conditions and disease development
sufficient disease incidence for differentiation of cowpea genotypes was observed in drought-stressed field experiments conducted in each of the three years. the historically high incidence of macrophomina-induced ashy stem blight on cowpea in the plots used for the experiments coupled with high temperatures and lack of significant precipitation in the study area enabled adequate disease development to facilitate phenotyping. average maximum daily temperatures during the experimental periods were  <dig>   <dig>  and 33°c for the  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> seasons, respectively, whereas average minimum temperatures were  <dig>   <dig>  and 17°c, respectively. for the same periods, total precipitation received was  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  mm, respectively.

phenotyping  <dig> diverse genotypes
based on percent plant mortality, there were reproducible differences in genotypic response to drought-enhanced macrophomina infection among the diverse set of fourteen cowpea genotypes over the two experiments conducted in  <dig> and  <dig> . genotypes it98k-499- <dig>  suvita  <dig>  it93k-503- <dig> and mouride were the most resistant to disease development with mortality less than 10% in both experiments . bambey  <dig> was the most susceptible genotype with a mortality of 25-39%, followed by cb <dig>  ucr <dig> , 524b, ucr <dig>  and it84s- <dig>  other genotypes exhibited varying levels of intermediate response over both experiments .

phenotyping rils
for the it93k-503- <dig> × cb <dig> ril population, there was significant correlation between all three field experiments for percent plant mortality based on spearman rank analysis . further, both greenhouse experiments were correlated  for disease severity, however correlations between field and greenhouse experiments were mostly insignificant with the exception of the field experiment conducted in  <dig> and greenhouse experiment  <dig> . percent mortality and disease severity phenotypic data from all five experiments deviated from normality and there was evidence of transgressive segregation for both resistance and susceptibility to macrophomina infection indicated by mean phenotypic scores of some lines lying outside the range of the parents .

qtl mapping, associated snp markers, and synteny
eight qtl regions distributed over four linkage groups of the cowpea consensus genetic map were detected in at least two different experiments based on the criteria described in the materials and methods. seven of the eight qtl derived their favorable allele from the resistant it93k-503- <dig> parental genotype whereas the favorable allele for qtl mac- <dig> was derived from the susceptible cb <dig> parental genotype. an additional suggestive qtl, mac- <dig>  did not meet the significance criteria, but was included because peaks were observed at the  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm positions of ril population linkage group  <dig> in three separate experiments . qtl mac- <dig> had the highest significance level as well as r <dig>  the same interval was mapped in all three field and one greenhouse experiments, meeting the kruskal-wallis significance threshold of  <dig>  in each case . lod traces of mac- <dig> qtl are shown in figure  <dig> for two experiments based on results of the mqm analysis. the r <dig> for this qtl ranged between  <dig> % and 40% across four experiments. the qtl peak co-located with snp marker 1_ <dig> derived from an est with a pectin esterase inhibitor annotation. this marker mapped to linkage group  <dig> of the cowpea consensus map. comparative genome analysis revealed extensive synteny between the cowpea region carrying the 1_ <dig> marker on linkage group  <dig> and a segment of m. truncatula chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . within the m. truncatula region, two copies of pectin esterase inhibitor gene and a pectin esterase virulence target gene exist. similarly, the corresponding soybean genomic region on chromosome  <dig> harbors a pectin esterase inhibitor and two copies of a pectin esterase encoding gene. a separate qtl, mac- <dig>  mapped on the same cowpea linkage group and co-located with snp marker 1_ <dig> derived from an est with a pectin acetylesterase gene annotation .

qtl mac- <dig> was identified in two field and both greenhouse experiments with r <dig> estimates between  <dig> % and  <dig> %. this qtl mapped within  <dig>  cm in three experiments . the most consistent loci for this qtl on cowpea linkage group  <dig> coincided with a mate efflux family protein encoding gene and was highly syntenic to homeologous regions on g. max chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  the region on soybean chromosome  <dig> harbored nine copies of the mate efflux family protein whereas the chromosome  <dig> region carried three copies of the gene.

for mac- <dig>  accounting for between  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance for response to macrophomina infection, the snp marker 1_ <dig>  derived from a homolog of the light harvesting complex psii  gene, co-located with the qtl peak in two of the three experiments in which the qtl was identified . the cowpea region harboring mac- <dig> revealed macrosynteny with sections on soybean chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> where copies of the lhcb <dig>  gene were found  <cit> . within the soybean chromosome  <dig> region, a homolog of the arginyltransferase  delayed senescence gene as well as a homolog of the elf <dig>  gene were found contiguous to the lhcb <dig>  locus  ftp://ftp.jgi-psf.org/pub/jgi_data/glycine_max/glyma1/.

qtl pyramiding
eight qtls  were selected for the single and pair-wise analysis based on their consistency in map location across experiments. in general, mean percent mortalities for the null genotypes were higher than genotypes with favorable alleles. however, in the analysis based on single qtls, only mac- <dig>  mac- <dig> and mac- <dig> showed statistically significant differences out of the eight qtls , and  <dig> out of the  <dig> pair-wise combinations showed significant differences . percent reductions for the pair-wise combinations ranged from - <dig>  to  <dig> % with six combinations resulting in a reduction of mean percent mortality greater than 40% . five of the six combinations had qtl mac- <dig> in common and these ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % reduction in mean percent mortality. the remaining mac-2/mac- <dig> combination resulted in a  <dig> % percent reduction, and the null genotypes for this combination also had the highest mean percent mortality . individually, mac- <dig> and mac- <dig> resulted in reductions of mean percent mortality of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, suggesting an additive effect in genotypes carrying both favorable alleles. this qtl combination was chosen for further analysis using the  <dig> and  <dig> data. the mac-2/mac- <dig> combination resulted in a  <dig> % reduction in mean percent mortality based on  <dig> data and  <dig> % for the  <dig> data . although they exhibited the largest reductions on percent mortality, qtl combinations with mac- <dig> were not favored for this analysis due to potential linkage or pleiotropic effects of the mac- <dig> locus with maturity which may limit its practical use.

co-location of drought and macrophomina resistance qtls
co-location was observed between mac- <dig>  mac- <dig>  and mac- <dig> with seedling drought response qtls dro- <dig>  dro- <dig>  and dro- <dig>  respectively, which were mapped previously  <cit> . in each case, the macrophomina resistance haplotype in these loci corresponded with the haplotype for tolerance to seedling-stage drought stress as measured by delayed drought-induced premature senescence. soybean genomic regions syntenic to the  <dig> qtl regions harbored osmotic stress responsive genes such as heat shock, calcium sensing and sodium hypersensitive genes. however, the region syntenic to mac- <dig> qtl region also harbored disease resistance/susceptibility genes such as glycoside hydrolase, lipase, pectinase, and pectin esterase genes.

discussion
important sources of genetic resistance to macrophomina were identified in cowpea genotypes assessed under mild drought-stress conditions. based on field screening, genotypes it98k-499- <dig>  suvita  <dig>  it93k-503- <dig>  and mouride exhibited the highest levels of resistance and are potential sources of host resistance in management strategies in response to macrophomina infection.

screening a ril population derived from a cross between the resistant it93k-503- <dig> and susceptible cb <dig> genotypes facilitated the genetic analysis of the resistance trait in one of these highly resistant germplasm sources. our qtl mapping approach took advantage of the recently developed high density est-derived snp marker consensus map of cowpea  <cit>  in which the it93k-503- <dig> × cb <dig> ril was a constituent map. the qtl mapping indicated a quantitative basis of this trait and also transgressive segregation for both resistance and susceptibility. the transgressive lines with higher resistance levels indicate the potential for selecting novel resistance forms in breeding populations in which the susceptible parent contributes to the resistance phenotype.

furthermore, genic snp markers with disease resistance gene annotation and disease resistance-associated genes were found in the genomic intervals defined by the qtl and these were located within syntenic regions in soybean and medicago. most interestingly, pectin metabolism related genes were identified in three major qtl intervals. the role of plant cell wall polysaccharides, including pectins, in defense against pathogenic microbes has been described  <cit> , and radha  <cit>  demonstrated that french bean plants infected with macrophomina had 50% less pectin compared to healthy ones, an observation attributed to the pectinolytic activity of enzymes released by the pathogen. examples of the role of pectins in pathogen defense in other systems include the over expression of pectin methylesterase inhibitors in arabidopsis that resulted in increased resistance to the necrotrophic fungus botrytis cinerea  <cit> . similarly, disrupting a pectin methylesterase gene resulted in reduced virulence of b. cinerea on apple , grapevine  and arabidopsis  <cit> . since macrophomina and b. cinerea share similar pathogenicity mechanisms involving pectin degradation as described above, these results suggest an important role for pectin-related genes in defense against macrophomina. however, this cannot be addressed in the present study, and additional functional genetic studies will be required to validate this potential role. qtl mac- <dig> coinciding with a pectin esterase inhibitor had the highest level of expression and statistical significance of all eleven resistance loci mapped in this study, making it a suitable target for molecular characterization. the significant effect of mac- <dig> on macrophomina resistance will likely result in noticeable and quantifiable change in phenotype sufficient to support its role as a mendelian factor. several other qtl mapped in intervals where disease resistance genes were found based on the cowpea genic-snp markers and synteny with soybean and medicago. these provide excellent additional candidate gene targets for functional characterization.

this study demonstrated the co-location of macrophomina resistance and maturity related senescence qtl in the ril population used for mapping. this finding in cowpea supports the suggested association between early maturity and susceptibility to macrophomina in other crops  <cit> . the same pattern of association between earliness and susceptibility to fungal pathogens has been described in other systems as well. notably, early maturing potato cultivars have been shown to be more susceptible to the late blight disease caused by the fungal pathogen phytophthora infestans  <cit> . similar to our findings, qtls independent of maturity effects have been reported providing the opportunity to breed for early-maturing, late blight-resistant potato cultivars  <cit> . gebhardt and valkonen  <cit>  suggested that this association was pleiotropic in nature with the same genes affecting both traits in potato. interestingly, based on cowpea synteny with soybean and medicago, both flowering and chlorophyll-metabolism related candidate genes were identified within the two maturity-associated qtl intervals and no apparent disease resistance genes were identified. although this does not exclude the role of other genes within these qtl intervals, these findings may provide additional molecular evidence for the association between early maturity and macrophomina susceptibility that has been described previously.

the association between early maturity and macrophomina susceptibility was demonstrated further by the locus carrying mac- <dig> and mat- <dig>  this locus had the largest effect on maturity-induced senescence in a previous study  <cit> , and in the current study, also had the strongest effect on mean percent mortality in both single locus and pair-wise loci analyses. however, the co-location of the maturity and macrophomina response qtl on this locus may limit its potential application in marker-assisted breeding programs due to tight linkage and possible pleiotropic effects. breeding for macrophomina resistant early-maturing varieties that are an important drought escape strategy in parts of west africa will be complicated by the opposite effects that this locus confers to earliness and macrophomina resistance. in our simulation study we selected mac- <dig> and mac- <dig> qtls as possible target qtls for pyramiding to improve macrophomina resistance. the presence of these two qtls resulted in a doubling in reduction of macrophomina-induced mean percent mortality compared to the presence of either qtl individually. this gain in effect was, however, much less significant  when we added a third qtl to this combination, suggesting that for breeding purposes, the value of pyramiding three loci compared to two may be markedly diminished.

genetic overlap was observed in cowpea only between three qtls mapped in response to drought-induced premature senescence and response to macrophomina infection. this represented a relatively small proportion of overlap considering the ten qtls mapped for the drought response  <cit>  and nine qtls mapped here for response to macrophomina infection. whether this co-location is due to linkage or pleiotropy will require further experimentation especially for mac- <dig> qtl where both osmotic stress and disease resistance genes were found in the corresponding syntenic soybean genomic region. similar findings were reported in sorghum where the non-senescence drought tolerance trait was shown to be largely independent from the macrophomina resistance trait  <cit> . these findings have important implications for cowpea breeding programs aimed at improving productivity under arid and semi-arid conditions. macrophomina can cause significant crop losses even under mild drought stress conditions, and introgression of macrophomina resistance loci should constitute an important component of the breeding schemes targeting genetic improvement with drought tolerance. furthermore, because early maturing varieties are used as a drought escape strategy in rain-fed production systems, the introgression of non-maturity related resistance loci will be required to mitigate their susceptibility.

CONCLUSIONS
important sources of macrophomina phaseolina resistance in cowpea were identified and qtls for trait determinants of the resistance were located on the est-derived snp map. our observations of candidate genes in the qtl regions with annotations commensurate with the respective phenotype used in revealing the qtl, support this qtl-based approach in identifying genetic determinants of important traits in cowpea. the added resolution provided by synteny with reference legumes makes this approach highly effective. however, because numerous candidates were identified for each qtl, there is a need for effective complementary strategies such as virus-induced gene silencing  to validate gene function. functional analysis also will require a robust greenhouse screening protocol, which based on the inconsistent correlation with field experiments, must be optimized to facilitate such studies. the quantitative nature of macrophomina resistance highlighted by the number of qtl identified in this study as well as the relatively low contribution of individual loci toward overall resistance makes breeding for this trait difficult. as such, targeting subsets of loci with higher cumulative effects followed by marker-assisted breeding offers an avenue to start incorporating resistance in economically important cultivars. however, the advent of high density marker-based breeding approaches such as whole-genome and genome-wide selection should enhance the ability of breeders to introgress numerous qtl within the context of the same breeding scheme.
