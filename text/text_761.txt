BACKGROUND
information on the spatial and temporal signatures of transcriptomes is essential for diagnosis and treatment of severe diseases such as cardiomyopathies and malignant cancers. for the past several decades, high-throughput  data generated using the microarray method have contributed significantly to the discovery of quantitative signatures of various diseases. however, the microarray method has critical limitations, such as spatial bias, uneven probe problems, low sensitivity, and dependency on the probes spotted. therefore, large-scale transcriptomic analyses using the microarray method have been superseded by the rna-seq generated through application of the recently developed next-generation sequencing  method.

rna-seq is a revolutionary method useful for transcriptomic signatures, since it can elucidate both quantitative and qualitative signatures  by de novo analysis, and it has therefore made possible the large-scale discovery of novel transcripts, such as noncoding rnas. as is an important event for proteome complexity and proteome diversity. however, current approaches using microarray or serial analysis of gene expression  tags have faced limitations, such as probe dependency and low coverage. the robust sequencing capacity of rna-seq has dramatically increased our knowledge of dynamic alternation via as. for instance, rna-seq has revealed the subtype-specific novel isoforms for the most common breast cancers , non-tnbc, and human epidermal growth factor receptor  <dig> -positive breast cancer  <cit> ). information related to novel exons, recognized in the intronic regions, has rapidly increased owing to rna-seq . de novo analyses of rna-seq datasets have rapidly updated the genome annotations of different species through examination of novel transcripts . furthermore, the detection of novel non-coding rnas by rna-seq has identified them as important functional molecules regulating various biological processes .

the present study employed rna-seq data to identify novel exons and novel transcripts enriched in different tissues in mice , leading to the discovery of novel transcripts expressed in testes or liver, and recognition that the novel isoforms containing the novel exons were dominantly expressed in testes or heart. these results should contribute to a more sophisticated annotation of the mouse genome, as well as improved understanding of tissue-specific gene regulation.

RESULTS
in silicoanalysis of tissue-enriched novel transcripts and exons
in order to identify tissue-enriched novel transcripts and exons in mice, the rna-seq datasets for six tissues   <cit>  were analyzed using the pipeline ‘tophat-cufflinks-cuffcompare’  <cit> . as a result,  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcribed loci were constructed using ucsc and ensembl, respectively. among the transcribed loci,  <dig> transcripts located in the intergenic region were collected as putative novel transcripts . from this list of putative novel transcripts, we further examined the tissue-enriched transcripts using deseq  <cit> . novel transcripts exhibiting significant enrichment  in the specific tissue were eventually defined as tissue-enriched novel transcripts. as a result,  <dig> and  <dig> novel transcripts were found to be significantly enriched in testes and liver, respectively .table  <dig>

 <dig> indicate the minimum and maximum p-values, respectively, when the expression of novel transcripts in testis compared to other tissues in a pairwise manner.



in addition to the novel transcripts, we examined the tissue-enriched novel exons for known genes and the novel junctions for the obtained de novo transcripts. in total,  <dig>  novel exons were identified from  <dig> tissues . to examine tissue-enrichment of the novel exons, the read numbers for the novel exons were counted and compared across the  <dig> tissues in a pairwise manner using deseq. of the  <dig> novel exons evaluated,  <dig> were expressed in testes , which was consistent with a study by howald et al. reporting that these novel transcripts are mainly identified in the testes of humans  <cit> .

experimental confirmation of testes- and liver-enriched novel transcripts
enrichment of the putative novel transcripts in testes and liver was further examined experimentally using mouse heart, testes, liver, kidney, brain and lung tissues by qrt-pcr and rt-pcr, to determine the expression levels and patterns. among the  <dig> testes- and  <dig> liver-enriched novel transcripts , enrichment of  <dig> tnts and  <dig> lnts were experimentally confirmed . we were unable to detect  <dig> tnts, including tnt- <dig>  − <dig>  and − <dig>  by rt-pcr. although highly specific expression of tnt- <dig> was found in testes using qrt-pcr, we could not detect the expression using rt-pcr, which may have been due to low expression levels.figure  <dig>

expression levels of tnts and lnts were generally enriched in testes and liver . however, the most specific expression in testes was observed in tnt- <dig> , a homolog to slc9c <dig>  which is a human na+/h+ exchanger. tnt- <dig> was the most abundantly expressed of the tnts . no expressed sequence tag  for tnt- <dig> has been reported to date, however, it is predicted to be homologous to cysteine-rich secretory protein  involved in sperm-egg fusion  <cit> . most of the tnts encoding proteins with mw values ranging from 6–389 kda exhibited a broad range of similarity  between the species . despite the absence of a matched mouse gene or est, tnt- <dig> was identical to the predicted protein model, xp_ <dig> , and shared high sequence identity with rat slco6d <dig> , suggesting that it may function as an ion transporter in testes. tnt- <dig> seems to encode a protein identical to np <dig>  encoded by gm <dig> in chromosome  <dig>  tnt- <dig> is located 3mbps away from gm <dig> in chromosome  <dig>  indicating that gm <dig> and tnt- <dig> are paralogs encoding the same protein sequence.

many of these novel transcripts are predicted to encode functional domains or highly homologous proteins in other species, as well . conversely, two testes-enriched novel transcripts  likely represented noncoding transcripts. noncoding transcripts are also important regulatory molecules involved in diverse processes such as gene-specific transcription  <cit> , regulation of basal transcriptional machinery  <cit> , splicing  <cit> , and translation  <cit> . the in-depth functional characterization of the confirmed testes- and liver-enriched novel transcripts is expected to lead to important information regarding tissue-specific gene regulation.

experimental confirmation of testes-enriched novel exons
among  <dig> testis-enriched novel exons,  <dig> novel exons were selected for experimental validation, on the basis of their read number , easiness of primer design, and straightforward exon structures. among the  <dig> testes-enriched novel exons , the strong enrichment of  <dig> tnes in testes was confirmed by qrt-pcr and rt-pcr . tne- <dig> of ms4a <dig> was the most abundantly and specifically expressed in testes, whereas tne- <dig> was barely expressed in testis. tne- <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig> and − <dig> were strongly expressed in testes, whereas little or no expression was observed in other tissues. multiple novel exons were identified for eya <dig> , fam71d  and pkm <dig> . we further examined the expression of the genes containing tnes to determine whether the expression was due to testes-specific genes. results indicated that most of the genes containing tnes were ubiquitously expressed in different tissues . however, the expressions of genes such as skp <dig>  eya <dig>  scamp <dig>  and zfp385a were significantly lower in testes than in the brain , despite strong expression of the tnes  in testes, while the strong expressions of tnes of fam71d, ms4a <dig> and 1700025f22rik were assumed to be due to the testis-specific expression of the genes.figure  <dig>

we hypothesized that the insertion of novel exons could produce new utrs or protein variants, as listed in table  <dig>  more than half of the testes-enriched novel exons  were identified as alternative 5′-utrs that would likely result in the differential regulation of transcription or translation in testes. several studies have demonstrated that testes-specific 5′-utrs include regulatory elements, such as the upstream open reading frames , for translational regulation . we also found that testes-enriched novel 5′-utrs have abundant uorfs  with some of  <dig> novel exons in the testes, suggesting a testes-specific regulatory role in translation. for example, more than  <dig> uorfs were found to be the testis-enriched 5′-utrs of nt5c <dig>  lrrc8b, mllt <dig>  mphosph <dig>  kdm5b, proca <dig>  and 5730559c18rik in  <dig> testis-enriched novel exons. additionally, the inclusion of tne- <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of eya <dig>  skp <dig>  higd1a and pkm <dig> could contribute to the 5′utrs forming g-quadruplex, which is involved in translational control  <cit> .table  <dig>

insertions of tnes may lead to dramatic changes in protein expression.  the c-terminal truncation  of ms4a <dig> is related to the insertion of tne- <dig>  ms4a <dig> is known to have four membrane-spanning domains  <cit> , but insertion of tne- <dig> results in the loss of two domains.  prediction by cnls mapper  <cit>  suggests that the novel isoform of efr3a lacks the c-terminal  <dig> residue sequence containing one of the nuclear localization signals . it is also possible that tne- <dig> plays an important role in the regulation of efr3a localization in testes  <cit> .  for tne- <dig> belonging to vapa, two variants showing a 9-bp difference were identified by cufflinks  and were predicted to encode 38– <dig> additional amino acids, gktppgiastvaslssvssavatpasyhlkndprelke . interestingly, it is likely that this sequence contributes to the membrane-spanning region in a testes-specific manner by the prediction using toppred  <cit>  . the function of vapa in neurons is known to be associated with er and microtubules  <cit> , and tne- <dig> might confer testes-specific functions via the membrane-spanning region. collectively, these data suggest that the testes-enriched novel exons could be involved in dramatic structural changes.

experimental confirmation of the heart-specific novel exons
among  <dig> heart-enriched novel exons,  <dig> novel exons  were selected for experimental validation, on the basis of their read number , easiness of primer design, and straightforward exon structures and the enrichment of  <dig> hnes in heart was experimentally confirmed by qrt-pcr and rt-pcr . most hnes were strongly expressed in the heart, except for hne- <dig> and − <dig>  multiple novel exons  were identified in mylk <dig> and predicted to produce a different 5′utr with slightly different n-terminal regions. similar to the tnes, the alternative 5′-utrs containing 1– <dig> uorfs were observed in the hnes for cluh, mylk <dig>  schip <dig>  larp <dig>  and nexn, suggesting heart-specific post-transcriptional regulation.figure  <dig> 
heart-enriched novel exons. the expressions of heart-enriched novel exons  were experimentally confirmed by  rt-pcr and  qrt-pcr. the expression levels of the genes containing the hnes were measured by  rt-pcr and  qrt-pcr.



among the variants identified, hne- <dig> of trdn is likely to result in truncation of the c-terminal region. a total of six isoforms were identified for trdn, and their estimated sizes were approximately  <dig> ,  <dig> , and 5 kb in the heart, and  <dig>   <dig> , and 7 kb in skeletal muscle  <cit> . in addition, hne- <dig> was specifically expressed in the heart and inserted in the transcripts expressed in skeletal muscle, which could result in the c-terminus-truncated trdn. based on analysis of data using cufflinks, the relative expression of the isoform containing hne- <dig> was predicted to be considerably lower than the known cardiac-specific isoforms , suggesting a restricted role for hne- <dig> of trdn in the heart.

several dramatic changes were predicted in the case of sorbs <dig> variants containing hne- <dig>  this predicted additional exon was highly enriched in proline residues such as pppapppdpp, ppclpfp, pkpyippstp, and pslptptsvp. proline-rich residues was known to be important for binding the sh <dig> domains in signaling cascades  <cit> , therefore it suggested the insertion of hne- <dig> might be involved in the regulation of signaling cascade in a heart-specific manner. at present, seven known isoforms of sorbs <dig> have been identified  and hne- <dig> is novel and appears highly enriched in the heart. additionally, data suggested that hne- <dig> from csde <dig> likely encoded a serine-rich region consisting of  <dig> additional residues . interestingly, ser- <dig> and thr- <dig> of hne- <dig> were predicted to be phosphorylated by pkc according to netphosk  <cit> , suggesting heart-specific signal regulation.

alternative splicing patterns of the novel isoforms containing the novel exons
we then compared the expression levels of the novel isoforms containing the novel exons to those of the known isoforms. as seen in figure  <dig>  at least  <dig> novel isoforms exhibited dominant expression when compared with the previously known isoforms in the heart or testes. more than 90% of the expressions of scamp <dig>  vapa, zfp385a, 1700001c02rik, fam71d, 1700025f22rik, and mtmr <dig> were identified in the novel isoforms in testes, suggesting testes-specific roles of the isoforms. for mtmr <dig>  a recent study reported that the testes-specific mtmr <dig> protein had a slightly higher molecular weight than the known protein, but the similar portions of the novel and known isoforms were observed at a protein level  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
alternative splicing patterns of the novel isoforms containing the novel exons.  multiple isoforms either with or without the novel exons were produced by rt-pcr. exon structures amplified by the primers are seen in the right panel, while novel exons are highlighted with blue boxes.  the relative expression levels of the isoforms were quantified by imagej.



conversely, the novel isoforms for pkm <dig>  ms4a <dig>  pfkm, and skp <dig> were expressed at relatively low levels in the testes. unexpected isoforms were observed in zfp385a, 1700001c02rik, fam71d, mtmr <dig>  and zfand <dig>  implying incomplete coverage in spite of the high-resolution of ngs. however, the rapidly accumulating datasets will help complete a mouse gene annotation.

expressional changes of heart-specific novel exons during cardiac hypertrophy
for the identified hnes, we investigated the alternative splicing patterns occurring during cardiac hypertrophy induced by transverse aortic constriction . the number of reads mapped to all exons, including hnes, were calculated using our rna-seq dataset  on cardiac hypertrophy  <cit> , and the differential expression levels of hnes were identified using dexseq  <cit> . two differentially expressed hnes  were obtained   from the analysis. as seen in figure 5a, the expression of cluh was significantly decreased by ~36% , while the expression of hne- <dig> decreased by ~65% during cardiac hypertrophy , indicating that hne- <dig> in cluh was alternatively spliced during cardiac hypertrophy . cufflinks analysis  indicated that the portion of the novel isoform containing hne- <dig> represented approximately 33% of the expression of cluh in the heart, and that the predicted protein derived from the isoform was  <dig> residues shorter than the known isoform. the expression of the heart-specific minor isoform containing hne- <dig> was thought to be down-regulated during cardiac hypertrophy.figure  <dig>

the expression of hne- <dig> in sorbs <dig> was also significantly decreased during cardiac hypertrophy. while the expression of sorbs <dig> gene was not changed , the expression of hne- <dig> was significantly decreased by ~36%  . thus, hne- <dig> was thought to be excluded during cardiac hypertrophy suggesting a disease-related function associated with hne- <dig> in the heart. therefore, we examined the relationship between cardiac hypertrophy and hnes, and further experimentally validated the significant exclusion of hne- <dig> and − <dig> of cluh and sorbs <dig> during tac-induced cardiac hypertrophy. as no changes were indicated in exercise-induced cardiac hypertrophy , we concluded that the exclusion of these exons could be related to pathology of the heart.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study will contribute to updating mouse gene annotation through the identification of specific tissue-enriched novel transcripts and novel exons. tissue-specific isoform switches mediated by novel exons could provide important insights into the tissue-specific roles of the novel exons. the exclusion of the hnes during cardiac hypertrophy also suggested sensitivity of the novel exons to pathological status. our findings emphasize the necessity of this approach to identify tissue-specific novel transcripts and exons.
