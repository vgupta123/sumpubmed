BACKGROUND
mast cells are known to play a pivotal role in inflammatory and allergic reactions. recently, they have gained new importance as immunoregulatory cells with the recognition that they are a major source of cytokines and chemokines and play roles in both innate and adaptive immunity  <cit> . despite their growing significance in normal and pathological conditions, much still remains to be learned about mast cell recruitment and maturation. like blood cells, mast cells are derived from pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells, but unlike blood cells they leave the bone marrow as progenitors and migrate to peripheral sites where they complete their maturation  <cit> . mast cell numbers increase at peripheral sites in response to inflammatory or allergic processes as well as in response to pathogens  <cit> . this increase in mast cell number is thought to be the result of proliferation of resident mast cell progenitors  as well as the recruitment of mcp from the bone marrow  <cit> . recent studies from our laboratory have identified a committed mast cell precursor  present in mouse bone marrow that is distinct from the tissue mcp  <cit> . in the previous study, a subtractive immunomagnetic isolation procedure with two mast cell specific antibodies, mab aa <dig> and mab bgd <dig>  was used to purify the mccp from mouse bone marrow. mab aa <dig> recognizes two derivatives of the ganglioside gd1b that are unique to rodent mast cells  <cit> , while mab bgd <dig> binds to a  <dig> kda protein on the surface of rodent mast cells  <cit> . both mab aa <dig>  <cit>  and mab bgd <dig> bind to granulated mast cells in all stages of maturation, but mab bgd <dig> also binds to an undifferentiated cell in the bone marrow that is not recognized by mab aa <dig>  this undifferentiated cell was characterized as a mccp  <cit> . the present study was undertaken to determine the mast cell response in the peritoneal cavity and the bone marrow during repopulation of the peritoneal cavity in rats. it was of interest to determine whether the mcp or the mccp was involved in repopulation of the peritoneal cavity. the results of the present study demonstrate that in response to mast cell depletion of the peritoneal cavity, a mcp is released into the circulation and migrates to the peritoneal cavity, while the mccp is retained in the bone marrow.

RESULTS
mast cell depletion of the peritoneal cavity reduces the mast cell number in bone marrow
intraperitoneal injection of distilled water is well known to lyse mast cells resulting in their disappearance  <cit> . in order to examine the kinetics of mast cell repopulation of the peritoneal cavity following distilled water lysis, mast cells were immunomagnetically separated from the peritoneal lavage using either mab aa <dig> or mab bgd <dig> conjugated to magnetic beads. in non depleted animals mast cells comprise 25% ±  <dig> % of the total cells in the peritoneal lavage . these mast cells are replete with metachromatic granules and are aa4+/bgd6+  <cit> . by  <dig> days after distilled water injection, although repopulation of the peritoneal cavity has begun, the per cent of mast cells in the lavage is only  <dig> % ±  <dig> % and is composed of very immature mast cells with characteristics consistent with their identification as mcp. by light microscopy, these mcp have a large nucleus and no metachromatic granules . the mcp isolated from the peritoneal fluid  <dig> hours after injection of distilled water could be conclusively identified as mast cells only by immunostaining in combination with transmission electron microscopy. these mast cells contain a few small cytoplasmic granules, a poorly developed golgi complex, few mitochondria and bind ige . by immunostaining, more than 98% of these mcp also express the α subunit of fcεri, c-kit, cd <dig> and cd <dig> and express the mast cell specific gangliosides recognized by mab aa <dig> . at six days after distilled water injection the number of mast cells in the peritoneal lavage increases to  <dig> % ±  <dig> % and by ten days the per cent of mast cells in the peritoneal lavage is close to control values,  <dig> % ±  <dig> %. however, there is more variability among the animals at  <dig> days, reflecting individual differences in the rate of mast cell repopulation of the peritoneal cavity. the mast cells isolated from the peritoneal lavage six  and ten days  after distilled water lysis, are more mature and can be recognized by light microscopy by the presence of metachromatic granules. when stimulated by antigen, at  <dig> days  and  <dig> days  after distilled water injection, the mast cells from the peritoneal cavity degranulate. these immature mast cells also degranulate in the presence of compound 48/ <dig> or when fcεri is crosslinked by mab bc <dig> , thus demonstrating their functional capability. by  <dig> days, repopulation is complete and the per cent of mast cells is almost the same,  <dig> % ±  <dig> %, as in non depleted animals.

if mast cells are being recruited from the bone marrow to repopulate peripheral sites, then the mast cell number should be diminished in the bone marrow after mast cell depletion of the peritoneal cavity. indeed, repopulation of the peritoneal cavity by mast cells after distilled water injection is initially accompanied by a dramatic decrease in the number of mast cells in the bone marrow . two days after i.p. injection of distilled water the number of aa4+/bgd6+ mast cells in the bone marrow has fallen from  <dig> % ±  <dig> % to  <dig> % ±  <dig> %. at six days the per cent of these mast cells in the bone marrow is recovering and has increased to  <dig> % ±  <dig> % and by  <dig> days has reached 1% ±  <dig> %, but does not approach normal levels until day  <dig>  when mast cell repopulation of the peritoneal cavity is complete. the number of mast cells is also reduced in a dose dependent fashion  <dig> days after i.p. injection of compound 48/ <dig>  or anti-ige , but this reduction is not seen with igg , indicating that the reduction in mast cell numbers in the bone marrow is a generalized response to mast cell mediator liberation in the peritoneal cavity.

a mccp, similar to that described for mouse bone marrow  <cit> , was also identified in rat bone marrow by sequential immunomagnetic isolation with magnetic beads conjugated to mab aa <dig> and mab bgd <dig>  by light microscopy, the aa4-/bgd6+ mast cells appear as a homogeneous population of small, 3- <dig> μm, undifferentiated cells with a centrally located nucleus?, little cytoplasm and contain no metachromatic granules. electron microscopy confirmed that the isolated mccp was a pure population of small undifferentiated cells containing scant cytoplasm, few organelles, no cytoplasmic granules and the cell surface is covered with short microvilli . the mccp comprises  <dig> % of the total cell population in rat bone marrow. by immunostaining, these cells are aa4-/bgd6+, c-kit+, cd34+, do not express fcεri or bind ige . in contrast to the more mature mast cells, the per cent of aa4-/bgd6+ mccp increases significantly from  <dig> % ±  <dig> % to  <dig> % ±  <dig> % in the first  <dig> hours after i. p. injection of distilled water. at six days, the number of mccp is  <dig> % ±  <dig> %, and reaches  <dig> % ±  <dig> % by  <dig> days. by  <dig> days the number of mccp in the bone marrow is close to normal values  . these results suggest that mcp are being recruited from the bone marrow to the peritoneal cavity and that the number of mccp in the bone marrow increases in response to the recruitment of mcp to the peritoneal cavity.

repopulation of the peritoneal cavity is due to both recruitment and proliferation of mast cell progenitors
in order to further investigate the process of repopulation of the peritoneal cavity,  <dig> hours after distilled water injection, the mesenteries were removed and examined for the presence of mast cells. in non-depleted mesenteries mast cells could be seen along blood vessels and in the mesenteric windows. these mast cells stained with toluidine blue  and immunolabeled with either mab aa <dig>  or mab bgd <dig>  in contrast, no mast cells could be seen in the mesentery of depleted animals by toluidine blue staining . however, when the mesentery was immunostained with mab aa4-fitc, mcp could be seen associated with mesenteric blood vessels . at higher magnification, it is clear that the mcp are inside the blood vessels . a small number of mcp, < <dig> mast cell/ <dig> blood cells, could also be immunomagnetically isolated from circulating blood  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours after mast cell depletion of the peritoneal cavity . no mast cells could be isolated from the blood of non depleted animals. the mcp from the blood are morphologically and phenotypically similar to the mcp found in the bone marrow  <cit>  as well as to the mature mast cells in the peritoneal cavity . at no time point could mccp  be isolated from cardiac blood.

another factor that may contribute to the increased number of peritoneal mast cells is the proliferation of mcp recruited to the peritoneal cavity. in order to investigate this possibility,  <dig> hours after distilled water injection the peritoneal lavage was collected and immunostained with both anti-phospho-histone h <dig> and mab aa <dig>  in the animals that had received distilled water, there was a significant increase in the percentage of mast cells in mitosis . these data indicate that it is a combination of the recruitment of mcp to the peritoneal cavity as well as the proliferation of these progenitors that results in mast cell repopulation of the peritoneal cavity after depletion by distilled water.

infused mast cell precursors  home preferentially to the bone marrow
when the peritoneal cavity is depleted of mast cells, the data presented above suggests that it is the mcp  that is recruited to the peritoneal cavity and that the mccp  remains and proliferates in the bone marrow. therefore, it was of interest to investigate the homing patterns of the mccp  as well as the mcp . the two populations of mast cells were immunomagnetically isolated and labeled with celltracker™ red or celltracker™ green. the labeled cells were then infused into the tail vein of rats. at various time intervals, cells from the bone marrow, spleen and lungs were examined by facs for the presence of the infused cells. at  <dig> hours after infusion, the mccp  was concentrated in the bone marrow, while the mcp  was concentrated in the spleen. at early times after infusion the mcp pass through the bone marrow and at  <dig> hours after infusion both mccp and mcp are seen to transit through the lungs . these results confirm that the mccp  is addressed to the bone marrow.

the behavior of these two mast cell populations was then investigated during the initial phase of repopulation of the peritoneal cavity when mast cells are seen in the blood . when the peritoneal cavity is not depleted, no infused cells are observed in the peritoneal lavage. as expected, under these conditions, the mcp  only pass through the bone marrow, while the mccp  accumulates there. in contrast, when the peritoneal cavity is depleted of mast cells by distilled water both populations of mast cells are seen in the peritoneal lavage. at  <dig> hours after distilled water, while no infused mcp  could be found in the bone marrow, there was a significant accumulation of mccp in the bone marrow . therefore even under conditions of mast cell depletion, the infused mccp still homes to the bone marrow, while the mcp goes preferentially to the peritoneal cavity.

discussion
this study demonstrates that bone marrow derived mast cells are involved in the repopulation of the peritoneal cavity following mast cell depletion. the mccp  is retained in the bone marrow and does not circulate, but proliferates and apparently gives rise to mcp that circulate and participate in the repopulation of the peritoneal cavity.

mast cells arise in the bone marrow as a committed precursor that leaves the bone marrow as a mcp and completes its differentiation at peripheral sites  <cit> . the rat mccp identified in this study is virtually identical to the mccp present in balb/c mouse bone marrow  <cit> . the mccp from both species ranges from  <dig> μm to  <dig> μm, has a large, centrally located nucleus, scant cytoplasm, and by electron microscopy contain no cytoplasmic granules. the mccp from both rats and mice is bgd6+, aa44-, fcεri-, cd34+, cd13+, c-kit+, and does not bind ige. a mast cell  similar to the mccp characterized in the present study has also been identified in bone marrow from adult c57bl/ <dig> mice. the bone marrow derived mast cell from c57bl/ <dig> mice gives rise only to mast cells when cultured and can reconstitute c-kit mutant mast cell deficient mice  <cit> .

little is known about the factors that may be responsible for release of mast cells from the bone marrow and their recruitment to peripheral sites. in the present study, two days after mast cell lysis by osmotic shock, degranulation by compound 48/ <dig> or anti-ige the number of mast cells in the bone marrow was the same, indicating that mediator release by all three methods is equally effective in reducing mast cell numbers in the bone marrow. while mast cell lysis is thought to release only pre-formed mediators, activation of mast cells by compound 48/ <dig> or activation through fcεri releases not only the pre-formed mediators stored in secretory granules, but stimulates the immediate production of newly formed lipid mediators as well as synthesis and release of cytokines and growth factors  <cit> . weller et al.,  <cit>  using cultured mouse bone marrow mast cells reported that leukotriene b <dig>  present in supernatants from activated mast cells, was the factor responsible for migration of immature mast cells and that other activation products were ineffective as chemotactic factors. however, since distilled water causes an immediate lysis of mast cells, it is not clear which, if any, of the newly-formed mediators are released. it is more likely that the recruitment of mast cell progenitors to the peritoneal cavity is mediated by the pre-formed mediators present in the secretory granules. a possible candidate for this recruitment is tgfβ <dig>  among the cell types involved in an innate immune response are mast cells  <cit> . when activated by compound 48/ <dig>  rat mast cells have been shown to liberate tgfβ <dig>  the tgfβ <dig> is stored in a latent form in secretory granules and upon mast cell activation is converted to the active form by chymase  <dig>  which is also stored in the secretory granules  <cit> . evidence suggests that tgfβ <dig> may be one of the most potent attractants for mast cells. tgfβ <dig> has been shown to cause directed migration of cultured mouse mast cells at femtomolar concentrations  <cit> . in the same study, other known mast cell chemoattractants including laminin, stem cell factor, and il- <dig> were all found to be considerably less effective in inducing mast cell migration. in addition to the direct effect of mediators on mast cells, mast cell recruitment from the bone marrow could also occur through the indirect effect of mast cell mediators on other cell types  <cit> , such as neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages and fibroblasts. activation of these other cell types could stimulate recruitment of mcp from the bone marrow.

mast cell repopulation of the peritoneal cavity occurs not only through recruitment of mcp, but also by proliferation of newly recruited mcp. under normal, non-pathological conditions, the mast cell mitotic index is considered to be very low  <cit> , but in the present study,  <dig> hours after i.p. injection of distilled water, the percentage of mast cells in mitosis was seen to increase four fold. the use of mast cell specific antibodies coupled with immunostaining for phospho- histone h <dig> was essential for the identification of dividing mcp that do not yet contain metachromatic granules.

a previous investigation from our laboratory has shown that while mast cells freshly isolated from rat bone marrow express the integrin subunits α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig> on their surface, the more mature, adherent mast cells expressed significantly more α <dig> integrin  <cit> . this change in expression of α <dig> integrin may be related to the release of mcp from the bone marrow to populate peripheral sites. specificity of integrin expression is known to play a pivotal role in mast cell homing. gurish et al.  <cit> , have shown that α4β <dig> integrin, but not αeβ <dig> integrin is required for tissue specific homing of mast cells to the small intestine. in β <dig> deficient c57bl mice, although mast cells were present in the lung, spleen, bone marrow and large intestine, mast cells were almost completely absent from the small intestine. furthermore, in balb/c mice that had been sub-lethally irradiated, administration of anti-α4β <dig> integrin, anti-α <dig> or anti-β <dig> antibodies blocked the mast cell repopulation of the small intestine after bone marrow reconstitution.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study shows that in response to mast cell depletion of the peritoneal cavity, it is the mcp that is released from the bone marrow into the circulation in order to repopulate peripheral sites. moreover, the mccp is retained in the bone marrow and it is the mccp population that expands to provide additional mast cells to repopulate these peripheral sites. this increased understanding of mast cell recruitment and repopulation provides additional therapeutic targets for control of the mast cell population in pathological conditions.
